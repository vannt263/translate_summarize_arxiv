    "quantum particles exhibit wave - particle duality @xcite .",
    "the wave nature allows quantum particles not only to show interference in a double - slit experiment but also to be indistinguishable from each other if they are in the same energy state .",
    "quantum particles are classified into bosons and fermions showing bunching and anti - bunching effects , respectively .",
    "a large number of noninteracting bosons can occupy the lowest energy state , while only one fermion can occupy a particular energy state due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "quantum particles exhibit entanglement @xcite , which is an essential resource in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "for example , by injecting single photons ( bosons ) to the input modes of a @xmath0 beam splitter , one can generate a well - known entangled state @xmath1 by hong - ou - mandel interference @xcite . for fermions , by injecting two electrons to two mesoscopic electron beam splitters @xcite , i.e. , @xmath2",
    ", one can generate a dicke state of three qubits with two excitations @xcite , @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "classical particles are distinguishable even in the same energy state , resulting in different statistics .",
    "the differences among classical , bosonic , and fermionic particles have been investigated with the statistical behavior of the particles at a lossless beam - splitter , for example @xcite . when each particle is injected into a @xmath0 beam splitter ,",
    "the output modes generate different statistics , i.e. , classical [ @xmath4 , bose [ @xmath5 , and fermi [ @xmath6 statistics .",
    "other works investigating the difference between these three different behaviors include @xmath7 measuring quantumness via an anticommutator @xcite , where the quantumness of any two quantum states was quantified by the nonpositivity of the anticommutator , and @xmath8 measuring bosonic and fermionic properties with the difference of vacuum state probability via addition - then - subtraction operation @xcite , where the measuring properties were restricted to vacuum and single - particle probabilities . for bosons ,",
    "there have been investigations on nonclassical properties by photon addition - then - subtraction operation @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sequential operations of addition and subtraction are useful in probing quantum commutation rules @xcite , improving entanglement properties in continuous variable systems @xcite , enhancing the degree of nonlocality @xcite , achieving noiseless amplifier @xcite , and quantifying bosonic ( fermionic ) behavior in composite particle systems @xcite .    here we propose a scheme to compare the three types of particles in a single mode via addition and subtraction operations and suggest possible experimental implementations .",
    "suppose one is given a device that adds and subtracts a given type of particle .",
    "this device works very differently for the three types of particles . for classical particles ,",
    "the addition and subtraction operations work deterministically , whereas for quantum particles , the operations can only be carried out probabilistically , e.g. , addition and subtraction of photons @xcite .",
    "thus , using an addition - then - subtraction operation , we can distinguish the quantum particles from the classical particles and quantify quantumness through their indistinguishability .",
    "we define the degree of indistinguishability as quantumness via addition - then - subtraction operation .",
    "it represents the tendency of particles to stay together in a mode .",
    "classical particles are distinguishable so that we can tell them apart .",
    "the degree of indistinguishability for classical particles is fixed , regardless of the number of particles .",
    "in contrast , bosonic particles are indistinguishable , so that we can not tell them apart .",
    "thus the degree of indistinguishability for bosonic particles increases with the number of particles .",
    "fermionic particles obey the pauli exclusion principle so that each particle should occupy one mode . due to this limit in the occupation number",
    ", the degree of indistinguishability for fermionic particles is bounded .",
    "we focus on multiparticle probabilities which are useful in quantifying the degree of indistinguishability for bosonic particles . for photons ,",
    "the degree of indistinguishability ( upon adding and then subtracting a photon ) increases with the increasing mean photon number and therefore the deviation from classical behavior increases .",
    "this feature is also present in the case of coherent states in spite of the fact that their fractional uncertainty in photon number and their phase uncertainty decrease , which is considered to be a classical feature of this class of states .",
    "this shows us that one has to be careful of what to measure to detect quantumness of bosonic systems .",
    "restriction to measurements of a photon number distribution fails to capture a highly nonclassical behavior that stems from indistinguishability of bosons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii begins with an identification of classical and quantum particles from the particle viewpoint and provides a generalized operator description .",
    "iii , we propose a measure to test bosonic and fermionic properties via an addition - then - subtraction operation .",
    "furthermore , we suggest implementable schemes in an atom - cavity system as well as in an all - optical system . we conclude in sec .",
    "we consider addition and subtraction operations to distinguish quantum particles from classical ones . in classical mechanics ,",
    "addition and subtraction operations are independent of the initial state , such that the initial state does not change after the sequential operation , i.e. , the addition - then - subtraction or subtraction - then - addition operation . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "addition and subtraction of a boson ( photon ) depends on the initial state .",
    "for example , when there are @xmath10 bosons initially , addition operation is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 indicates the probability amplitude that we can identify the photon we added in the final state after addition .",
    "subtraction operation is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 indicates the probability amplitude that we can identify the photon we subtracted in the initial state before subtraction .",
    "after the addition - then - subtraction operation ( @xmath9 ) or subtraction - then - addition operation ( @xmath15 ) on a state @xmath16 , the corresponding particle state becomes @xmath17 or @xmath18 , where the prefactors ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath10 exhibit the tendency for bosons to stay together in a mode .",
    "differences between classical and quantum particles are clearly seen from the effects of addition and subtraction of particles on a single - particle state .",
    "note that one has to start with at least one particle because the process of one - particle subtraction is not possible when there is no particle to begin with . for one - particle _ subtraction then addition ,",
    "there is no difference between classical and quantum particles if we start with one particle : the initial particle is merely taken away from the initial place and then returned to the same place .",
    "for one - particle _ addition then subtraction   from one particle , however , there is a difference between classical and quantum particles . of course , a classical particle returns to the initial state after the operations , but this is not the case for a quantum particle . after adding one quantum particle to the initial one",
    ", it is impossible to deterministically subtract the same particle since quantum particles are indistinguishable .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .  1 , where we associate the indistinguishability with the overlap between the quantum particles . _ _",
    "a formal description of the addition and subtraction operations can be given within the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "we define generalized subtraction and addition operators as @xmath20 where @xmath10 is the number of particles , and the addition operator @xmath21 is derived by the adjoint of the subtraction operator .",
    "the differences between quantum and classical systems are typically ascribed to the commutation relation of the addition and subtraction , which vanishes for classical particles . using the relation ( 2.1 )",
    ", we can test the commutator , @xmath22=\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}(|k_n|^2-|k_{n-1}|^2)|n-1\\rangle\\langle n-1| ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 . to make the right - hand side zero",
    ", we can put all the coefficients @xmath24 equal , i.e. , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , such that we obtain the relation , @xmath27=|k_1|^2|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ ] .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath28 should be zero to make the commutator vanish .",
    "however , the operator vanishes in this case , and one sees that the commutation relation can not be made to disappear completely in this classical regime .",
    "the situation is very different in the quantum regime . for bosonic particles ,",
    "the commutator is equal to the identity , @xmath27=i$ ] , with @xmath29 . for fermionic particles , due to the pauli exclusion principle",
    ", the operator is transformed into @xmath30 such that the anticommutation relation becomes @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the anticommutator is equal to the identity with @xmath32 .",
    "we have shown that although quantum formalism readily admits the description in terms of commutation relation , the generalization to the classical regime is not straightforward .",
    "it can be understood by looking into the two terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 separately .",
    "based on the relation ( 2.1 ) , we obtain the following relations : @xmath35 for @xmath36 , the relations become @xmath37 , and @xmath38 respectively . from this",
    ", one immediately sees that the commutation relation can not approach zero because of the vacuum component in the addition - then - subtraction operation .",
    "therefore , instead of the commutation relation , we propose to consider the addition - then - subtraction operation which reduces to the identity for classical particles . for @xmath39 initial classical particles @xmath40 ( @xmath41 )",
    ", we obtain the result @xmath42 with the relation ( 2.3 ) and @xmath43 . for @xmath39 bosonic particles @xmath44 ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath45 with @xmath29 . for @xmath39 fermionic particles @xmath46 ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the pauli exclusion principle and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , by looking at the norm of the state @xmath52 , we can figure out whether a given particle is classical , bosonic , or femionic : @xmath53 the general relations for classical and quantum particles are shown in table i , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 are for @xmath43 , @xmath29 , @xmath51 respectively .",
    "motivated by the above equations , we quantify the degree of indistinguishability @xmath57 where @xmath39 is the number of particles and classical , bosonic , and fermionic particles correspond to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    ".classical and quantum particles [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we investigate the difference between bosonic and fermionic properties via the addition - then - subtraction operation and propose implementable schemes for bosons in all - optical and atom - cavity systems .",
    "the addition and subtraction operations are one - sided unitary , @xmath61 , in the classical limit , i.e. , the addition operation is norm preserving for classical particles . for quantum particles ,",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "thus , based on the norm preserving property ,",
    "we can write down an analytic relation for bosons and fermions .      the norm increases after the addition operation for bosonic particles , whereas it decreases for fermionic ones , except the initial vacuum state .",
    "it is convenient to write it in the following form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 denotes a boson ( fermion ) , and the equality holds for the vacuum state .",
    "we can test the inequalities with a density matrix , @xmath65 , which can be considered in the case of bosons as well as fermions .",
    "this density matrix can be generated with quantum scissors @xcite and a thermal field , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the mean photon number ) . the beam splitter @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) transforms the input modes as @xmath72 and @xmath73 [ @xmath74 and @xmath75 ] .",
    "coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the transmissivity and reflectivity of the beam splitter @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "thus the density matrix becomes @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "when applying it to the inequalities ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) , the left - hand side becomes @xmath80 for bosons and @xmath81 for fermions .",
    "note that this measure is different from the measure proposed by kurzyski et al .",
    "@xcite , which is optimized for the density matrix @xmath82 at @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "our measure is optimized for @xmath82 at @xmath84 .    for bosons , we can test other quantum states , such as a coherent state @xmath85 or a thermal state @xmath86 .",
    "the left - hand side of the inequality ( 3.1 ) becomes @xmath87 and @xmath88 for coherent and thermal states , respectively .",
    "we can see that the degree of indistinguishability for the states increases with the mean photon number of each state .",
    "furthermore , we can consider higher - order relations as follows : @xmath89 where @xmath10 is a positive integer .",
    "since the operator @xmath55 is equal to the photon annihilation operator @xmath90 , the left - hand side of the inequality ( 3.4 ) becomes the expectation value of the antinormal ordering operator , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is positive semidefinite @xcite . for coherent and thermal states , the l.h.s .",
    "of the inequality ( 3.4 ) becomes @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , where @xmath96 is the laguerre polynomial . for a given mean photon number ,",
    "their indistinguishability increases much more rapidly with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , we do not consider the operation @xmath15 .",
    "thus , for consistency , the expectation value @xmath97 should be measured without resorting to the commutation relation . for this purpose , we consider coupling a probe to a bosonic system @xmath98 .",
    "this indirect measurement requires only a two - level probe , whereas a direct measurement requires a multilevel probe . here",
    ", we show that it is possible to obtain the expectation value @xmath99 by counting the photon number of the idler mode in a nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) with small coupling strength .",
    "likewise , the expectation value is also obtained by detecting the atomic state of the atom - cavity field system at @xmath100 if the atom is initially prepared in the upper state @xmath101 .    in an optical system",
    ", the norm of bosonic particles via addition operation can be obtained with the help of an ndpa with small coupling strength @xmath102 .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath98 is injected to a single mode of the ndpa with the idler mode in the vacuum state , @xmath103 in this case , there are only two possibilities on the number of photons in mode b , as verified in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "then , counting the number of photons in mode b , we get the probability of each outcome , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , as follows : @xmath106 given a coupling strength of the ndpa , we can obtain the norm of bosonic particles after the addition operation by counting the number of photons in mode b , @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we assume that the norm of the initial state is equal to 1 , i.e. , @xmath110 . @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the number of counts that zero and one photon are detected in mode b , respectively . at @xmath113 @xcite , the probability of detecting more",
    "than one photon is negligible and one would see no detection event except for the few times when one photon is detected in the idler mode b. by considering an on - off detector efficiency @xmath114 , eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) becomes @xmath115 .    in an atom - cavity system",
    ", we can obtain the norm by interacting a two - level atom with a single - mode cavity field at resonance .",
    "the time evolution of the atom - field system is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "@xmath120 is the atom - field coupling constant , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are atomic ladder operators with @xmath101 and @xmath123 denoting the upper and lower states of the atom , and @xmath124 and @xmath90 are photon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "initially , the atom is prepared in @xmath101 and the cavity field is in an arbitrary pure state @xmath125 .",
    "then , the atom - cavity system evolves as @xcite @xmath126 at @xmath100 , @xmath127 equation ( 3.10 ) can be approximately satisfied with small coupling constant ( @xmath120 ) , and short interaction time ( @xmath76 ) for a given maximum photon number .",
    "then , detecting the atomic state , we obtain the norm @xmath128 where @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) is the counting number of the atom in the lower ( upper ) state . for a coherent state ,",
    "the condition equivalent to @xmath100 is achieved by keeping the amplitude @xmath131 of the coherent state small and keeping the interaction time short , which can be controlled by the speed of an atom injected into a cavity @xcite .",
    "the atoms passing through the cavity field will be detected in the upper state most of the time with only a small number of them detected in the lower state .",
