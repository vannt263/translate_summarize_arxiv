    "poincar discovered his conformal models of hyperbolic geometry in an attempt to understand whether there were solutions to the hypergeometric equation of higher periodicities than the then known circular and elliptic functions ( of genus @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "the names , fuchsian and kleinian functions , which he coined , belong to a certain class of automorphic functions that live on tiles that tessellate the half - plane or disc , depending on which model is chosen .",
    "the indicial equation is a solution to a differential equation in the neighborhood of a singular point .",
    "an equation of second - order can have at most three branch points , which are conveniently taken to be @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . the use of a matrix to describe how an algebraic function is branched had been introduced by hermite , but it was riemann who first considered products of such matrices .",
    "frobenius showed that the hypergeometric equation is completely determined by its exponents at its singular point . if the only effect of analytically continuing two solutions around a singular point is to multipy them by a constant , then the differences in the exponents must all be _ integers _ , without the solution containing a logarithmic term . in other words ,",
    "the matrices are rotations about each of the singular points where performing a complete circuit multiplies the solution by a constant factor .",
    "we will generalize these rotation  matrices through real angles to complex  ones , and in so doing elliptic transformations will become loxodromic ones .",
    "the monodromy matrices of riemann are generators of a group , and are either homothetic ( magnification ) or rotation .",
    "these are related to the hyperbolic and elliptic geometries , respectively , both of which preserve the unit circle . according to the riemann mapping theorem , any arbitrary region bounded by a closed curve can be mapped in a one - to - one fashion onto the interior of a unit disc by an analytic function .",
    "riemann arrived at his theorem as an intuitive conjecture in 1852 , and it is hardly comprehensible that it took almost fifty years to prove it . according to schwarz , the only biunique analytic mappings of the interior of the unit disc onto itself is a linear , fractional ( mbius ) transform of the hyperbolic or elliptic type ; that is , magnification or rotation .",
    "the relevant equation for quantum theory is the confluent hypergeometric equation , where two the branch points of the hypergeometric equation merge at @xmath2 to become an essential singularity .",
    "the origin is the regular singularity .",
    "the two parameters of the equation determine the regge trajectories , and the degeneracy of the angular momentum states .",
    "the regge trajectories express the angular momentum in terms of the energy , and if the potential is real , or the energy is greater than the potential energy , the angular momentum will be real and discrete . the parameter that determines the trajectories discriminates between quantized motion of bound states and unstable resonance states . in the former case it is negative , and identified as the radial quantum number , whereas in the latter case it can be associated with a complex  angle . in the case of the nonrelativistic coulomb interaction , the bohr formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom result when the parameter is set equal to a negative integer , which is also the index of the laguerre polynomials that represent the radial component of the wave function .",
    "all this can be obtained without the usual procedure of expanding the radial wave function in a series and terminating it at a certain point to obtain a quantum condition .",
    "rather , if the energy becomes positive , the potential complex , or the potential energy greater than the total energy , quantization does not occur , and the parameter represents an angular point whose homologue is branch point .",
    "the new point is the generalization of the angular point to complex values .",
    "this is not unlike the generalization of the scattering amplitude to make it a function of the angular momentum . in order to make the scattering amplitude a function of the angular momentum",
    ", it had to be made complex and continuous so that one could take advantage of poincar s theorem which says that if a parameter in a differential equation , the angular momentum , or the wavenumber , appears only in the analytic function in some domain of the parameter , and if some other domain a solution of the equation is defined by a boundary condition that is independent of the parameter , then this solution is analytic in the parameter in the domain formed from the intersection of the two domains .",
    "in other words , poincar had shown that , under suitable conditions , the smooth solution to the differential equation could be made an analytic function of the parameters of that equation by allowing them to become complex and continuous , instead of real and discrete .",
    "the reason for naming the trajectories after regge@xcite was that he brought poincar s theorem to the attention of high energy physicists .",
    "instead of confining his attention to integer angular momenta , regge transformed the scattering amplitude so that it became a function of the , continuous , angular momenta . in order to do so , he had to allow it to become complex .",
    "regge s idea was not new , it had already been used by poincar himself , and nicholson in 1910 , to describe the bending of electromagnetic waves by a sphere .",
    "sommerfeld and watson used it to describe the propagation of radio waves on the surface of the earth , and their scattering from various potentials .",
    "it has become known as the sommerfeld - watson representation .",
    "the new , unphysical , regions provided proving grounds for speculative high energy physics . the passage from a real to a complex parameter is not nearly as radical as that from a discrete to a continuous one , or from a positive to a negative one .",
    "how does one define negative  angular momenta ?",
    "the angular momentum is represented in the equation for the energy as a centrifugal repulsion . at a constant attractive potential ,",
    "the only way the energy could be made more negative , thereby allowing more bound states to be formed , is to convert a centrifugal repulsion into a centripetal attraction  by allowing the angular momentum to become negative .",
    "the limit occurs where the two indicial solutions to the schrdinger equation with a centrifugal term coincide .",
    "one is called the regular  solution because it goes to zero at the origin , while the other is the irregular  solution because it blows up there .",
    "conventionally , the latter solution is rejected because any admixture of the two would not lead to a unique solution .",
    "however this is incorrect because _ both _ indicial exponents determine how the ratio of the solutions , which is an automorphic function , transform .",
    "an automorphic function is a periodic function under the group of linear ( fractional ) substitutions .",
    "when poincar came on the scene in 1880 the only two periodic functions that were known were the trigonometrical and elliptical functions . by cutting and pasting edges of the fundamental region together",
    "one could get solid figures with different amount of holes , or genus .",
    "trigonometric functions had no holes , elliptic functions , one hole belonging to a torus , and poincar wondered if there were automorphic functions with a greater number of holes . any given point of the fundamental region would be transformed into the same point in an adjacent fundamental region by the linear fractional transformation .",
    "it would not connect points in the same fundamental region , for , otherwise , it would not be fundamental .",
    "for instance , if the angular momentum is negative and in the interval @xmath3 $ ] , the plane would be tessellated by crescents formed from the intersection of nonconcentric circles whose angle would be the degeneracy of states .",
    "it is precisely in the unphysical region that the greater than unity cosine has become a hyperbolic cosine with a complex angle .",
    "the crescent of the plane with a given angle will be successively transformed by the fractional linear transformation ultimately returning to itself .",
    "thus , the entire plane is divided into portions equal in number of the periodic order of the substitution .    when two particle collide there is a scattering angle , @xmath4 , whose cosine resides between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the physical region",
    ". however , by allowing @xmath7 to go to either plus or minus infinity , enables one to consider infinite momentum transfer .",
    "such large momentum transfer occur over extremely small distances .",
    "thus , large @xmath7 is adapted to the study of strongly scattered waves that can bind and resonate .",
    "poles can be expanded in a bilinear series of the products of legendre functions of the first and second kinds .",
    "only when the pole is within a given ellipse will the series converge .",
    "the ellipse is determined by the trace of the monodromy matrix which is a hyperbolic cosine with a complex argument .",
    "the hyperbolic cosine of the real component is the semi - major axis of the ellipse , while the imaginary component is the eccentric angle of the ellipse . in the case of coulomb scattering",
    "the real component is the ratio of the charges to the velocity of the incoming particle so that the ellipse will be larger the smaller the velocity of the incoming particle .",
    "this is referred to as the classical region . as the velocity increases we are transformed into the relativistic region with a decrease in the size of the ellipse .    what is a complex angle ? in optics ,",
    "complex angles arise when a refractive wave does not penetrate into the second medium , but , rather , propagates parallel to the surface . the system is then said to suffer total internal reflection .",
    "there is no energy flow across the surface , and at the angle of incidence there is total reflection . for angles of incidence greater than the critical value ,",
    "the angle of reflection becomes complex with a pure imaginary cosine meaning the wave is attenuated exponentially beyond the interface .",
    "the three poles of the second order differential equation are associated with the thresholds of particle creation in high energy physics.@xcite their residues  are given by the angles of a triangle which tessellate the complex plane .",
    "the angles themselves may be complex like the argument of the hyperbolic cosine above . in order to tessellate the plane it must reproduce itself by rotating about any given axis .",
    "when the angles become complex , it will not only rotate the sides of the triangle but will also deform them . the fact that any two angles are complex conjugates , related to source and sink , will render the sum of the angles real but , may not be equal to @xmath8 .    for regge trajectories",
    "these angles represent the complex angular momentum .",
    "below threshold the imaginary component of the angle momentum vanishes for there is no state to decay into so the resonance width is zero .",
    "regge gave an interesting interpretation to the imaginary component of the angular momentum .",
    "just as the longer the time the smaller the uncertainty in energy , so that long time uncertainty is related to small resonance widths , imaginary angular momentum is related to change in angle through which the particle orbits during the course of a resonance .",
    "for extremely long resonances , the angle of orbit is large until it becomes permanent in a bound state .",
    "triangle functions which tessellate the complex plane are described by automorphic functions which represent solid figures .",
    "the automorphic functions are the inverses of the quotients of the two independent solutions to a second order differential equation .",
    "these quotients can be moved around the complex plane by linear fractional transformations which delineate the fundamental regions .",
    "schwarz showed how these automorphic functions map one complex plane onto another , just like the hyperbolic cosine maps ellipses in one plane onto circles in another .",
    "the angles are either the interior , or exterior , angles of the triangle which is the fundamental region . in the case of",
    "large , but real , @xmath7 , the automorphic function is none other than the expression for the legendre function of the second kind at a large value of its order , the angular momentum.@xcite it tessellates the surface of a sphere with triangles whose bases lie on the equator of the sphere , each angle being @xmath8 radians , and one vertex at the north pole whose angle is proportional to the difference between the order of the legendre function and the angular momentum of the regge trajectory .",
    "the solid is a double pyramid , or a dihedron , whose triangles have sums greater than @xmath8 radians , and , therefore , belong to elliptic geometry .",
    "in fact , this automorphic function has been proposed as a partial wave scattering amplitude .",
    "another proposal was made by veneziano@xcite who showed that the euler beta integral satisfies the duality principle of high energy physical where the scattering amplitude remains the same under the exchange of total energy and momentum transfer .",
    "experimentally , this is achieved by replacing the particle with its anti - particle .",
    "it so happens that the beta integral is the automorphic function of schwarz for triangle tessellations .",
    "the angles are the regge trajectories which become complex above threshold .",
    "in fact , a beta integral with real arguments could not represent a complex scattering amplitude for it would be physically measureable being the distance between the angles in the triangle .",
    "the veneziano model , which has served as the impetus of string theories , was found to be wanting in the hard sphere limit because it did not reflect the granular , or parton - like , behavior observed in deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "what is the use of automorphic functions in high energy particle physics ?",
    "first , it provides restrictions on the nature of the complex regge trajectories and on the nature of the potentials .",
    "the potentials must be real for bound states , complex , or imaginary , for resonances .",
    "second , the possibility of their being a complementarity between continuous groups in quantized systems and discrete groups with a continuous range of non - quantized parameters for bound states and resonances .",
    "third , the spectrum of resonances that lie along a regge trajectory is likened to the nesting and proliferation of circles when the number of generators is increased .",
    "the confluent hypergeometric equation arises from the confluence of two singularities in riemann s hypergeometric equation leaving the regular and irregular singularities at @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "it can therefore describe an infinite - range potential like the coulomb potential for which it is given by   there is real .",
    "the same expression can be found in ref .  .",
    "but then the quantization condition @xmath9 is complex .",
    "* eq .  ( 27 ) p. 156 ) since @xmath10 is imaginary for bounded states , and not the velocity @xmath11 , the quantization condition is real .",
    "rather , in ref .   the condition @xmath9 is taken as the condition of the poles of the @xmath12-matrix , giving the position of the @xmath13 regge pole . ] @xmath14 the parameters for the coulomb interaction are @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total angular momentum , @xmath18 is the coulomb parameter which is negative if the charges @xmath19 and @xmath20 are opposite , and @xmath21 is the energy of the incoming particle in units @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 determines the nature of the trajectories . if @xmath9 , the system has bound states where @xmath13 is the radial quantum number , and the total energy , @xmath24 .",
    "this specifies the kummer function @xmath25 as a laguerre polynomial of index @xmath13 .",
    "specifying the regge trajectory ( [ a ] ) avoids the introduction of a series expansion in the schrdinger equation , and imposing a cut - off . when @xmath26 , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ kummer ] ) reduces to a product of an exponential function and a hyperbolic bessel function .    the confluent hypergeometric equation , ( [ kummer ] ) ,",
    "can be easily converted into the schrdinger equation , @xmath27 by the substitution @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . alternatively , if we did nt know eq .",
    "( [ kummer ] ) , we could transform ( [ schrodinger ] ) into it by inverting the substitution .",
    "the indicial equation as @xmath30 is @xmath31 where the constant @xmath32 is conventionally set equal to zero in order for @xmath25 not to diverge at the origin .",
    "however , at @xmath33 both terms give the same dependence upon @xmath34 .",
    "it is precisely at @xmath33 where the regular , @xmath35 , and irregular , @xmath32 , solutions in eq .",
    "( [ indices ] ) , coincide .",
    "there is no reason to constrain the angular momentum to positive integral or semi - integral values since we are considering elementary  and composite  particles , which may be stable or unstable .",
    "we may look for a solution to eq .",
    "( [ kummer ] ) in the form of a laplace transform  @xcite , @xmath36 for the ( normalized ) wavenumber , @xmath37 .",

    "in contrast to the original confluent hypergeometric equation ( [ kummer ] ) , which has branch points at @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we have added an additional branch point at @xmath1 by considering the wave number .",
    "this branch point may be thought of as placing a bound , @xmath47 on the momentum @xmath48 by the square root of twice the total energy , like the maximum momentum of a fermi gas of elementary particles at absolute zero.@xcite    the difference between ( [ c ] ) and ( [ a ] ) determines the second angle as @xmath49 which is the complex conjugate of ( [ a ] ) .",
    "we will appreciate that attractive and repulsive coulomb potentials always appear as complex conjugates , or , equivalently , for every source there is a sink .",
    "if @xmath50 and @xmath51 are any two particular solutions to the hypergeometric equation , then the wronskian is given by  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "dividing both sides by @xmath53 , it becomes the derivative of the ratio @xmath54 of the two particular solutions .",

    "the group of automorphisms are triangular tessellations of the unit disc .",
    "our interest will be focused on the momentum space at @xmath61 in ( [ laplace ] ) . since the hypergeometric equation with the coefficient @xmath62 , @xmath63 has one solution , @xmath64 which is an incomplete beta function , @xmath65 if the constant of integration is set equal to unity .",
    "the second solution @xmath66 is given by an automorphic function @xmath67 .",

    "the schwarzian derivative has a long and glorius history dating back to lagrange s investigations on stereographic projection used in map making .  @xcite    the third angle can be read off from the schwarzian , ( [ schwarzian ] ) , and is @xmath75 which is the original angle of the crescent , having branch points at @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the centrifugal potential in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the coulomb potential introduces the complex conjugate angles , @xmath23 and @xmath76 , which make the interaction independent of whether it is attractive or repulsive since they appear symmetrically .",
    "if we adhere to the triangle representation , the requirement that the angles be less than @xmath8 limits @xmath17 to the closed interval @xmath77 $ ] . in this interval , centrifugal repulsion @xmath78 becomes centrifugal attraction .     for @xmath33 ,",
    "the sum of the angles  of the triangle , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath0 is @xmath8.@xcite the analytic function @xmath65 given by ( [ beta ] ) for @xmath81 maps the upper half - plane @xmath82 onto the interior of a half - strip  formed by the two base angles  @xmath83 and @xmath84 corresponding to the points @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the @xmath37-plane .",

    "( [ beta - tris ] ) tells us there there will again be an infinity of regge poles .",
    "however , these will not correspond to bound states or resonances because the regge poles are restricted to the left half of the @xmath17 plane .",
    "this information is contained in the amplitude , and it is equivalent to two @xmath12-matrix elements , one being the inverse of the other.@xcite    parenthetically , we would like to point out that the regge pole behavior for an infinite - range potential is quite different than that for short range ones . a regge trajectory for a short - range potential would have the form @xmath91 where the prime stands for differentiation .",
    "the intercept of @xmath5 is called for by the form of the angular momentum term @xmath92 in the schrdinger equation . the fact that the cross - sections do not vanish asymptotically with the energy , but increase slowly with it is attributed to an exchange of a reggeon",
    "whose intercept is @xmath6.@xcite however , a positive intercept can not be interpreted as originating in the angular momentum .",
    "this is substantiated by the fact that only negative intercepts give rise to the conservation of angular momentum in hyperbolic space.@xcite    in eq .",
