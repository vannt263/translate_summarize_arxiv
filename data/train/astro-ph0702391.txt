    "time - distance helioseismology ( duvall et 1993 ) has a track record of significant findings in solar physics : from the subsurface structure and flow fields of sunspots ( duvall et 1996 ; kosovichev et 2000 ; zhao et 2001 ) to the mapping of large - scale subsurface flows ( haber et 2002 ) , and even to the in - progress far side imaging ( zhao , private communication ) .",
    "these results are based on the assumption that the acoustic wave travel times are only marginally affected by the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "recent work in sunspot seismology , based largely on helioseismic holography techniques , however , point to a dominant influence of surface magnetic field on two related phenomena : the so - called showerglass effect ( lindsey & braun 2005 ) , and the effect of an inclined magnetic field ( cally et 2003 ; schunker et 2005 ; and schunker & cally 2006 ) . a clear understanding of the origin of these surface effects is still lacking , and recent results point to contributions from several distinct sources : while schunker et ( 2005 ) , and associated modelling work ( schunker & cally 2006 ) , emphasize the importance of wave propagation in inclined magnetic field to the azimuthally varying local control correlation phases ( braun & lindsey 2000 ) over penumbral regions , rajaguru et ( 2007 ) show that such wave propagation effects could manifest through altered height ranges of spectral line formation that affects doppler shift measurements within sunspots . while such surface effects have been confirmed present in time - distance measurements too ( zhao & kosovichev 2006 ) ,",
    "these latter authors conclude that they do not change appreciably the previously obtained deeper extending two - region ( cold - hot ) structure of sound - speed perturbations below a sunspot and thus stress the presence of real subphotospheric structures . here",
    "we analyze 16 active regions of different sizes and magnetic field fluxes : we compute travel - time perturbation maps for 11 travel distances and invert them for 3-dimensional sound - speed perturbations beneath each active region .",
    "we show the presence of ring - like structures of significant positive sound speed changes , down to a depth of about @xmath0 mm , that seem likely to be artifacts due to our ignoring the surface magnetic effects in the inversion procedures .",
    "we perform experiments to check the origin of these surface effects : the amplitude effect [ interaction of phase - speed filter with localised reduced amplitudes of oscillations within sunspots , rajaguru et ( 2006 ) ] is shown not to account for it , the location and frequency dependence of the ring - like sound speed excesses are found to be related to similar dependences of travel times observed recently by braun & birch ( 2006 ) , and the ring - like structures are shown to be present only on the outgoing travel - time maps .    in section 2",
    "we describe the methodology applied here to obtain travel - time maps and to invert for the sound - speed perturbation . in section 3",
    "we present our results .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we use high - resolution dopplergrams derived from filtergrams of circular polarization component of ni i ( @xmath1=6768  ) observed by the solar oscillations investigation / michelson doppler imager ( soi / mdi ) onboard soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) ( scherrer et 1995 ) .",
    "these dopplergrams are mapped using a postel projection and are tracked at the snodgrass differential rotation rate corresponding to central latitude of the mdi hi - res field of view ( mapping and tracking are done using the `` fastrack '' program in the stanford mdi / soi pipeline software ) .",
    "dopplergrams that are contiguous in time are stacked together to produce 3d datacubes @xmath2 of the line - of - sight ( l.o.s ) doppler velocity at the solar surface , where @xmath3 is the horizontal vector , and @xmath4 is the time coordinate .",
    "the dimensions of these datacubes are @xmath5 nodes , with a spatial resolution @xmath6 mm , and a temporal resolution @xmath7 minute .",
    "the same procedure is applied to produce datacubes of the l.o.s magnetic field @xmath8 , and of the continuum intensity @xmath9 .",
    "the continuum intensity is the intensity in the solar continuum as measured by mdi at the tuning position number zero , corresponding to two symmetrical measurements 150 m@xmath10 away from the ni i line center .",
    "the doppler velocity datacubes are detrended by a linear fit of the long - term temporal trend .",
    "when a dopplergram has no data or is corrupted , we replace it by the average of its neighbors .",
    "we have selected datacubes containing sunspots of various sizes and magnetic field strengths .",
    "unfortunately , due to a saturation effect in the mdi magnetogram measurements in large sunspots , the absolute value of magnetic field strength in the umbrae of such spots is smaller than the actual values present in them .",
    "this phenomenon was explained by liu , norton , & scherrer ( 2007 ) as being due to a limitation in the onboard processing of dopplergrams and magnetograms .",
    "it limits our access to very large sunspots .    for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "a sunspot is defined as a group of contiguous pixels with a l.o.s magnetic field strength larger than 150 gauss and that exhibits both an umbra and penumbra .",
    "the area of a spot is only the number of pixels within this spot multiplied by the area of a pixel @xmath11 mm@xmath12 .",
    "the l.o.s magnetic field flux is the value of @xmath13 at each pixel muliplied by the area of a pixel .",
    "table [ table.spot ] summarizes the properties of the active regions studied in this paper , while figure [ f1 ] shows maps of their continuum intensity @xmath14 .",
    "the time - distance formalism was introduced by duvall et ( 1993 ) .",
    "it is based on computation of cross - covariances between the solar oscillation signals at two locations on the solar surface ( a source at @xmath15 and a receiver at @xmath16 ) . due to the stochastic excitation of acoustic waves by the solar convection zone and due to the oscillation signal at any location being a superposition of a large number of waves of different travel distances ( i.e. , of different horizontal phase velocities @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the horizontal wavenumber and @xmath19 is the temporal angular frequency ) , the cross - covariances are very noisy and need to be phase - speed filtered and averaged ( duvall et 1997 ) .",
    "the doppler velocity data cube @xmath2 is phase - speed filtered in the fourier domain , using a gaussian filter @xmath20 for each travel distance @xmath21 .",
    "the standard scheme of averaging is to average the point - to - point cross - covariances over an annulus of radius @xmath22 centered on the source . such point - to - annulus",
    "cross - covariances are computed for several distances @xmath21 ( 55 in this paper ) , and then averaged by groups of 5 distances to further increase their signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a detailed explanation of all these steps in the analysis process can be found in , , couvidat , birch , & kosovichev ( 2006 ) , along with a table of distances @xmath21 and phase - speed filter characteristics used ( see table 1 of previous reference ) .",
    "the point - to - annulus cross - covariances are fitted by two gabor wavelets ( kosovichev & duvall 1997 ) : one for the positive times , one for the negative times .",
    "we use the ingoing ( i ) and outgoing ( o ) phase travel times @xmath23 returned by the fits .",
    "the average of these two travel times , @xmath24 , is , in first approximation , sensitive only to the sound - speed @xmath25 in the region of the sun traversed by the wavepacket ( where @xmath26 is the vertical coordinate ) . using a solar model as a reference we can relate the mean travel - time perturbations @xmath27 to the sound - speed perturbations @xmath28 through an integral relation :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the area of the region , and @xmath31 is its depth .",
    "the sensitivity kernel for the relative squared sound - speed perturbations is given by @xmath32 .",
    "here we use born - approximation kernels kindly provided by birch ( birch , kosovichev , & duvall 2004 ) .",
    "these kernels take into account the finite wavelength effects of the wavefield .",
    "equation 1 is only approximate because effects on the mean travel times other than the sound - speed perturbation are completely ignored .",
    "for instance , bruggen & spruit ( 2000 ) describe the impact of changes in the upper boundary condition in sunspots due to the wilson depression ; woodard ( 1997 ) and gizon & birch ( 2002 ) demonstrate that increased wave damping in sunpots can introduce shifts in travel times ; finally , the significant magnetic field effects , already mentioned in introduction , also contribute to @xmath33 .      based on equation [ eq1 ] the mean travel - time perturbation maps ( 11 of them per datacube )",
    "are inverted for sound - speed perturbation using a regularized least - squares scheme based on a modified multi - channel deconvolution algorithm ( mcd ; see couvidat et 2005 for details on the modified algorithm , and jacobsen et 1999 for the basic algorithm ) .",
    "the modified algorithm includes both horizontal and vertical regularizations .",
    "we use the weighted norm of , and that of the first derivatives of , the solution @xmath34 for vertical and horizontal regularization , respectively .",
    "following couvidat et ( 2005 ) the covariance matrix of the noise in the travel - time maps is included in the inversion procedure , and is obtained by 40 realizations of noise travel - time maps based on the noise model by gizon & birch ( 2004 ) .",
    "both the horizontal and vertical regularization parameters are constant for the inversion of travel - time maps of all our datasets .",
    "these parameters are chosen empirically .",
    "we invert for 13 layers in depth , with the center of the deepest layer located @xmath35 mm below the solar surface .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the mean travel - time perturbation maps for a travel distance @xmath36 mm over the 16 active regions .",
    "the main feature visible on most maps is a central white disk of increased travel times .",
    "surrounding this disk , a dark ring corresponding to a decreased mean travel time is clearly present .",
    "umbra and penumbra boundaries overplotted on figure [ f2 ] show that this dark ring is mostly located within the penumbral region of the spot .",
    "such dark rings actually appear in travel - time maps for 2 of the 11 distances @xmath21 studied here : @xmath37 mm and @xmath36 mm .",
    "an azimuthal average of @xmath27 around the sunspot center for 5 circular sunspots shows the average amplitude of the rings and their extent ( see figure [ f9 ] ) .",
    "the rings do not seem to be present at @xmath38 mm ; some spots exhibit them but most do not .",
    "when travel - time maps are inverted for sound - speed perturbations , they produce the well known two - region structure below the active region : first the sound speed decreases just below the photosphere and then increases at a depth of about 3 - 4 mm , depending on the sunspot size and magnetic flux .",
    "these two regions can be seen in figure [ f6 ] : this is a vertical cut in the inversion result for the active region noaa 8397 .",
    "the dark ring surrounding the corresponding sunspot on the travel - time maps of figure [ f2 ] appears on figure [ f6 ] as two bright arms extending from the region of increased sound - speed toward the surface",
    ". these arms are especially well visible at a depth of about @xmath39 mm .",
    "their amplitude decreases when we get closer to the solar surface .",
    "the rings / arms are not visible anymore at the surface , in agreement with the travel - time map at @xmath38 mm .",
    "such ring - like / arm - like structures are present on most sunspots .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows horizontal cuts in the inversion results for the layer @xmath40 to @xmath41 mm , while figure [ f8 ] shows similar cuts for the layer @xmath41 to @xmath42 mm .",
    "an azimuthal average of the sound - speed perturbation for 5 circular sunspots as a function of the radial distance to the spot center is plotted on figure [ f4 ] , for the layers @xmath40 to @xmath41 mm ( upper panel ) and @xmath41 to @xmath42 mm ( lower panel ) . at the layer @xmath40 to @xmath41 mm ,",
    "the averaged amplitude of the increased sound - speed region is always above the noise level on the inverted results , with a maximum value of about @xmath43 , corresponding to a sound - speed increase of about @xmath44 km s@xmath45 . neglecting the magnetic field influence , any change in the first adiabatic exponent , and any change in the mean molecular weight",
    ", we have @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , a @xmath47 increase in @xmath48 , translates into an upper limit for the temperature increase at @xmath49 mm of about @xmath50 k. for the layer @xmath41 to @xmath42 mm , the maximum value of the sound - speed perturbation for the 5 sunspots of figure [ f4 ] is about @xmath51 after azimuthal averaging , corresponding to an upper limit for the temperature increase of @xmath52 k.    it is worth mentioning that these ring - like / arm - like structures have already been detected in the past : for instance , figure 4 of hughes , rajaguru , & thompson ( 2005 ) clearly shows a ring on the inverted sound - speed perturbation map at @xmath53 to @xmath54 mm .",
    "their inversion was performed using ray - path approximation kernels , and the algorithm was lsqr and not the mcd used here .",
    "another example is figure 8 of couvidat et ( 2004 ) which shows a clear ring structure around the sunspot noaa 8243 , after inversion with fresnel - zone sensitivity kernels .",
    "the significance of these rings had been dismissed at that time .    to understand the nature of these rings artifacts or real physical features we perform several analyses .",
    "first , a recent study by rajaguru et ( 2006 ) shows that the interaction of phase - speed filtering in time - distance analysis and the spatially localized p - mode amplitude reduction in sunspots introduces travel - time artifacts that are significant for short travel distances . to make sure that the rings we observe on the travel - time maps are not due to this p - mode amplitude effect",
    ", we applied the power correction suggested in their paper to a couple of sunspots : the dark ring is still present after correction , even though with a different size and a different amplitude .",
    "figure [ f11 ] shows the impact of this correction : there might be a dependence on the sunpsot size ; the dark ring being more affected by the power correction for small spots .",
    "second , braun & birch ( 2006 ) observed frequency variations of solar p - mode travel times , using acoustic holography .",
    "they believe these variations are , at least partly , produced by surface effects due to magnetic fields . to test whether or not the dark rings have this frequency dependence , we followed braun & birch ( 2006 ) and computed some travel - time maps at @xmath36 mm with the same phase - speed filter but different temporal frequency filters : on top of the phase - speed filter @xmath20 we add a gaussian @xmath55 filter with a fwhm of @xmath56 mhz and centered on different frequencies ( @xmath573 , 4 , and @xmath58 mhz ) .",
    "the resulting travel - time maps for noaa 9493 are shown in figure [ f10 ] : the size and amplitude of the ring clearly depend on the @xmath59 filter used . at low frequencies ( @xmath59 filter centered on 3 mhz )",
    "the ring is almost non - existent , but as the frequency content of the wave - packets shifts to higher frequencies the ring broadens and its amplitude increases . at @xmath58 mhz , the ring extends inside the umbra and , maybe , even beyond the penumbra .",
    "therefore , the near absence of rings on travel - time maps for @xmath38 mm might be partly due to the phase - speed filter we use at this distance : this filter selects wavepackets with a maximum power at about @xmath60 mhz .",
    "however , for @xmath36 mm , the selected wavepackets have a maximum power at about @xmath61 mhz .",
    "it should be noticed that with our frequency and broad phase - speed filters , selecting a specific frequency band also means selecting a slightly different average phase speed : both effects are entangled .",
    "therefore what we consider to be a dependence on frequency might partly be a dependence on phase speed .",
    "figure [ f10 ] also shows that the travel times in the umbra of the sunspot depend on frequency , albeit to a lesser extent than in the penumbra .",
    "therefore , the rings might be the manifestation of a phenomenon affecting the entire spot , and directed from the periphery ( the penumbra ) to the center ( the umbra ) when the wave - packet frequency selected for the time - distance analysis is increased .",
    "nevertheless , we do believe that the qualitative sound - speed inversion result below the umbra ( two - region structure ) holds , because the mean travel - time perturbation in the vicinity of the spot center is still consistently positive with the frequency filters applied for @xmath36 mm .",
    "however , this analysis undoubtedly confirms that the layers below a spot umbra have a lateral extent and an inverted @xmath48 amplitude that depend on the wave - packet frequency .",
    "the problem seems less acute for deeper layers : the travel - time maps for larger distances @xmath21 also vary with the frequency but no structure similar to the rings is ever present . even though we suggest that the qualitative result of the sound - speed inversion below a sunspot is valid , any attempt to quantitatively assess the corresponding sound - speed perturbation amplitude and the lateral extent of the decreased sound - speed region are inextricably connected to the frequency band selected .",
    "third , with the phase - speed filters ( no frequency filter ) , we notice a strong asymmetry between ingoing and outgoing travel - time maps : the rings seem to be present only on the outgoing travel times ( see figure [ f13 ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry might be an additional sign of an interaction of the wavefield with surface magnetic field ( as suggested in , , lindsey & braun 2005 ) , but such a feature can also be explained by a flow ( as first suggested by duvall et 1996 ) .",
    "figure [ f13 ] shows that the ring appears both as partly due to a sound - speed perturbation ( because it is visible on the mean travel - time maps ) , and as partly due to a flow if we accept the interpretation of duvall et ( 1996 ) ( because it is visible on the difference travel - time maps ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath62 at @xmath36 mm points to an inflow below the spot umbra , and an outflow in the penumbral ring .",
    "such a reversal in the flow direction seems physically implausible .",
    "finally , figure [ f12 ] shows a loose dependence of the maximum sound - speed perturbation in these rings at a depth of @xmath40 to @xmath41 mm as a function of the total magnetic flux of the sunspot : the larger the magnetic flux or the sunspot size ( table [ table.spot ] shows a linear relation between these two parameters ) , the larger is @xmath63 in the arms / rings . this last observation is inconclusive though because the subsurface structure of the spot might also depend on the total flux :",
    "it does not help in discriminating between the ring - as - artifact and the ring - as - real - structure hypotheses .",
    "considering that the rings are located mainly below the sunspot penumbra in the inversion results and inside the penumbra on the travel - time maps , that there is a strong asymmetry between ingoing and outgoing travel - time maps ( with rings present only on the outgoing travel times ) , and that the ring size and amplitude have a very clear frequency dependence , it seems hard to believe that the sound - speed increase they imply is the signature of a real solar feature located in depth .",
    "indeed it seems more likely that these rings are spurious features produced by frequency dependent surface effects somewhat related to the strong magnetic field of the sunspots , which are not accounted for in the inversion procedure .",
    "we clearly detect rings of negative mean travel - time perturbations on the travel - time maps of most sunspots for travel distances between @xmath37 and @xmath36 mm .",
    "these rings produce significant arm - like / ring - like structures on the inversion results , mimicking regions of increased sound speed . however due to the locations of these structures ( immediately below the sunspot penumbrae ) , and their sensitivity to the filtering applied to the doppler velocity datacubes ,",
    "it is likely that they are artifacts produced by the interaction of the wavefield and surface magnetic fields .",
    "these significant structures were not mentioned in the paper by zhao & kosovichev ( 2006 ) . even though we agree with their conclusion that the effect of the surface magnetic field probably does not change the qualitative inversion result of the basic sunspot structure ( the two - region structure ) ,",
    "we show that these inversion results for the first 3 - 4 mm below the solar surface appear to be significantly contaminated by surface effects probably of magnetic origin .",
    "indeed , the rings could be the most visible manifestation of a general phenomenon that also affects the amplitude and the lateral extent of the sound - speed perturbation in the shallower subsurface layers .",
