    "recent experiments of holmium atoms ( ho ) on a manganese oxide - layer ( mno ) have shown that one can stabilize single atomic spin moments for long time scales , i.e. , hours @xcite .",
    "this , and other experiments @xcite , open new ways towards realization of single - atom memory devices .    experimentally it has been shown that one can control the magnetic moment and detect the spin excitations of molecules by electrical current @xcite .",
    "together with other new methods for probing single - molecule spin states @xcite , future control and read - out of single molecules is possible .",

    "for example , by adding a langevin term to the equation , one can simulate temperature effects for studies of , e.g. , the spin seebeck effect @xcite .    due to the pioneering work done in the late 1990s @xcite ,",
    "ultra - fast demagnetization of materials and ultra - fast spin dynamics have been getting a lot of attention .",

    "methods using quantum master equations @xcite and stochastic llg equation @xcite have been thoroughly investigated .",
    "another technique , which will be used in this paper , is to derive a spin equation of motion ( seom ) from the spin action defined on the keldysh contour , considering the nonequilibrium properties of the effective spin moment @xcite .",
    "this provides a general description of the spin dynamics and exchange interactions in the nonequilibrium regime @xcite .",
    "similar approaches have previously been used in order to understand effects in the stationary limit , such as voltage dependence , geometric phases and chaotic behaviors @xcite . here",
    ", we study the transient regime , considered through a generalized seom where the parameters depend on both time and history .    in this study , we examine the limitations of the llg equation by comparing three different approximation schemes .",
    "first , by making use of the born - oppenheimer approximation , one can derive a generalized seom where the parameters evolve with time and depends on the full memory of the system .",
    "the second approximation scheme is to assume a slowly varying spin , such that we can disregard the spin history and retain a llg equation with time - dependent parameters , henceforth referred to as tdllg .",
    "the third approximation scheme is obtained by considering the parameters of the generalized seom in the stationary limit , resulting into a llg equation with constant parameters .",
    "this is the commonly used approach when performing llg calculations .",
    "our main result is summarized in fig .",
    "[ solutiondiagram ] . for femtosecond time - scales ,",
    "the electron dynamics become increasingly important and the born - oppenheimer approximation is no longer valid . therefore",
    ", the generalized seom is not sufficient and a full quantum mechanical treatment is necessary .",
    "this is also true in the anderson limit , where strong correlations have to be considered for the on - site terms .",
    "the generalized seom is valid for picosecond time - scales and in systems which can be described by the kondo model , e.g. , a localized spin pertaining to magnetic molecules . disregarding history , as in tdllg , one can treat slower dynamics and systems having an exchange coupling less than a few mev . for dynamics in the nanosecond time - scales and",

    "the moment of inertia term , @xmath3 , has here been added in comparison to the conventional llg equation , as there has been suggestions of its importance to short - time dynamics @xcite .",
    "if we instead use a microscopic approach @xcite , using non - equilibrium conditions , we can define an effective action of the spin and from that derive generalized seom , given by @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the effective magnetic field acting on the spin and @xmath6 is the dynamical exchange coupling between spins at different times . the effective magnetic field is defined as @xmath7 where the first term is the external magnetic field and the second term is the internal magnetic field due to the electron flow . in the derivation , we assumed a classical spin of constant length , and ignored quantum fluctuations @xcite . while eq .",

    "hence , while the former is a simple instant approximation , the latter provides a description based on the whole past evolvement of the spin .",

    "we retain eq . from eq . by assuming that * s * is slowly varying with time , @xmath8 , which leads to @xmath9 here , the first term adds a contribution to the effective magnetic field , the second term corresponds to the gilbert damping and the third term to the moment of inertia . in the form of the llg equation",
    "we identify the renormalized effective magnetic field @xmath10 the damping tensor @xmath11 and the moment of inertia term @xmath12 this is still more general than the conventional llg equation , as the parameters depend on time evolution of the charge and spin background .",

    "this is included in the dm interaction , last term in eq . .",
    "the dm interaction can be interpreted as a current through the system and describes a general form of spin current mediated interaction .",
    "it is analogues to the spin transfer torque term found in similar treatments of ouf - of - equilibrium spin systems @xcite .      in the stationary limit",
    ", the exchange coupling and the parameters of the equation of motion simplifies further . ignoring the moment of inertia term",

    "next , we bring the general framework to a specific set - up and we consider a magnetic molecule embedded in a tunnel junction between metallic leads , see ref .",

    "the first test is to see if the results of the generalized seom can be recreated in different limits by the approximations , e.g. , low exchange and tunneling coupling . in order to study the transient regime",
    ", the system has an abrupt on - set of a voltage bias and the exchange interaction at time @xmath71 .",
    "we begin by considering the low coupling regime for symmetrically coupled leads , i.e. , @xmath72 mev . in fig .",
    "[ diffszsolution](a ) the solution of the full equation of motion is shown together with the solution of the tdllg equation , fig .",

    "we see that for the generalized seom , fig .",
    "[ diffszsolution](a ) , there are sudden changes in the transient regime and after about 10 picoseconds the system has stabilized and achieved a stationary solution . for the tdllg equation , fig .",
    "[ diffszsolution](b ) , it is clear that the generalized seom is reproduced .",
    "however , in the case of constant parameters , fig .",
    "[ diffszsolution](c ) , the solution clearly differs from the other two .",
    "this can be observed in the internal field , @xmath74 , shown in fig .",
    "[ diffszsolution](d)-(f ) for the three different schemes .",
    "the internal field changes rapidly after the on - set , while it increases adiabatically for the stationary solution ( do also note the difference of the size of the field by an order of magnitude ) .",
    "thus , due to the failure to capture the rapid dynamics , the solution for the constant parameters differs from the solution of the dynamic ones .",
    "this result shows the importance of treating the dynamic properties of the equation of motion in the picosecond regime and a failure of a stationary treatment in a system far from equilibrium .",
    "thus far , we have only included damping .",
    "considering the weak coupling regime , i.e. , where the exchange coupling @xmath14 and tunneling coupling @xmath75 is small , higher order terms in the generalized seom , such as moment of inertia , will be of importance . comparing the generalized seom , fig .",

    "[ diffszlowcoupling](b ) , and with both damping and inertia , fig .",

    "[ diffgammacut](a ) , and the tdllg , fig .",

    "increasing the coupling parameters gives rise to back - action in the generalized seom , fig .",
    "[ diffgammacut](a ) , which in turn flips the spin moment , something that is not present in the tdllg solution due to the lack of feedback in the equation .",

    "[ diffgammacut](c ) , is shown for different couplings and fig .",
    "[ diffgammacut](d)-(f ) shows the corresponding dm - field in the z- , x- and y - direction , respectively .",
    "thus , for the generalized seom in the strong coupling regime , the effective fields acting on the spin exert a significantly larger torque on the spin , specially from the heisenberg interaction and dm - interaction .",
    "these non - adiabatic effects can not be captured by a more simplistic treatment of the equation , as observed in fig .",
    "[ diffgammacut](b ) .",
    "therefore , the tdllg solution breaks down in the case of strong coupling , and the stationary state of the system also differs due to the nature of the initial dynamics of the strong - coupled system .",
    "in conclusion we have compared three different approximation schemes for treating the transient spin dynamics of a magnetic molecule .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ solutiondiagram ] .",
    "they show that conventional llg with constant parameters does not capture the fast dynamics in the system , while the tdllg fails to capture the strongly coupled regime .",

    ", we can incorporate the changes in the electronic background , and thereby treat faster dynamics .",
