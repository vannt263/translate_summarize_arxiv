    "motion of inertial ( i.e. small heavy ) particles in turbulent fluids occurs in natural phenomena as well as in technological processes and therefore has excited theoretical investigations , see for example the book @xcite and the references therein .",
    "examples for such processes are formation of raindrops , evolution of clouds and combusting of liquid fuel .",
    "+ the starting point for many theoretical investigations concerning the motion of inertial particles in turbulent flows is _ stokes law _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which says that the force exerted by the fluid on the particle is proportional to the difference between the background fluid velocity and the particle velocity , i.e. we are concerned with the following transport equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the velocity of the fluid at point @xmath3 in space at time @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the position of the particle at time @xmath4 . here",
    "the _ response time _",
    "@xmath6 in two dimensions or @xmath7 in three dimensions is often called _ stokes time _ , where @xmath8 is the particles mass , @xmath9 the particles radius , @xmath10 the fluid _ viscosity _ and @xmath11 a universal constant .",
    "we neglect that @xmath12 actually depends on the radius @xmath9 and the relative velocity , making the law non - linear @xcite .",
    "further , an important non  dimensional parameter related to the equation ( [ sec-1-eq1-stokes - law ] ) is the so  called _",
    "stokes number _",
    "@xmath13 , which is the ratio of the particle aerodynamic time constant to an _ appropriate _ turbulence time scale . in turbulent fluid flows @xmath13",
    "is usually defined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the _ eddy turnover time _",
    "associated to the _ kolmogorov length scale _",
    "@xmath16 with viscosity @xmath10 and _ mean energy dissipation rate _ @xmath17 . if @xmath18 the equation ( [ sec-1-eq1-stokes - law ] ) tends to @xmath19 , which is the equation of motion a of particle moving with constant velocity . and if @xmath20 , i.e. the inertia of the particle is neglected , we get @xmath21 , which is the equation of motion of a _ fluid particle _ or a _ passive tracer _ , which is a particle that follows the streamlines of the fluid .",
    "various extensions of the basic model ( [ sec-1-eq1-stokes - law ] ) have been considered in the literature , in particular by maxey and collaborators @xcite .",
    "+ real world and numerical experiments show that the distribution of inertial particles in a turbulent fluid is highly correlated with the turbulent motion ( @xcite ) . the particles cluster in regions of low vorticity and high strain rate .",
    "this clustering phenomenon is known as _",
    "preferential concentration_. the stokes number @xmath13 plays a central role in the effect of preferential concentration . if the particle and fluid time constant have almost the same order , i.e. @xmath22 , the particles concentrate in regions where straining dominates vorticity .",
    "experiments at high or low stokes numbers do not show this clustering phenomenon . + a model for the motion of inertial particles in two dimensions which covers the preferential concentration phenomenon",
    "was introduced by sigurgeirsson and stuart in @xcite and analyzed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "this model consists of stokes law ( [ sec-1-eq1-stokes - law ] ) , where the velocity field is a gaussian random field that is incompressible , homogeneous , isotropic and periodic in space , and stationary and markovian in time .",
    "this gives the equations in _ non  dimensional _ form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the two  dimensional torus , @xmath26 is an infinite  dimensional brownian motion with an appropriate infinite  dimensional separable hilbert space @xmath27 as state space and the self  adjoint operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 on @xmath27 will be chosen to match a desired energy spectrum of the velocity field . the equation ( @xmath30 ) is interpreted as a linear stochastic evolution equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "precise assumptions will be given later .",
    "in @xcite various qualitative properties of the system ( @xmath31 ) have been studied , such as existence and uniqueness of solutions and existence of a random attractor . in particular , numerical simulation in @xcite , see also @xcite , indicates that system ( @xmath31 ) also covers the preferential concentration phenomenon , where now the parameter @xmath32 can be interpreted as stokes number , whereas @xmath33 indicates how fast the velocity field decorrelates .",
    "therefore , the random attractor of the system ( @xmath31 ) is highly relevant for the study of preferential concentration of inertial particles .",
    "+ further , various limits of physical interest in system ( @xmath31 ) have been studied : rapid decorrelation in time limits @xcite and diffusive scaling limits ( homogenization ) @xcite . + also of interest are studies of system ( @xmath31 ) for fluid particles or passive tracers , i.e. @xmath34 and so ( @xmath35 ) is replaced by @xmath36 .",
    "this problem in a similar framework was considered among others by carmona , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ in this work we generalize the results of sigurgeirsson and stuart in @xcite to the fractional noise case , i.e. in the system ( @xmath31 ) the stochastic evolution equation ( @xmath30 ) will be driven by an infinite  dimensional fractional brownian motion @xmath37 with arbitrary hurst parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we recover system ( @xmath31 ) as a special case for @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , we improve sigurgeirsson and stuart s assertion in @xcite concerning the existence and uniqueness of the random attractor in such a way that we extend the universe of attracting sets from deterministic bounded sets to random _ tempered _ sets with an explicit representation of a random tempered the universe absorbing set . the main motivation to use fractional noise , to model now a fractional gaussian random velocity field ,",
    "is that there exist certain statistical similarities in the scaling behaviour of a fractional brownian motion and a turbulent velocity field .",
    "these statistical similarities are described in the next section . + also of interest and what sigurgeirsson and stuart have not done , is to give analytic ( upper ) bounds of the hausdorff dimension of the random attractor , which is almost sure constant due to the ergodicity of the noise .",
    "this will be studied also in the fractional noise case in a forthcoming paper .",
    "+ the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the motivation to use fractional noise to model the random velocity field . section 3 provides properties of a stationary fractional ornstein  uhlenbeck process , which are needed in section 4 , where we introduce the generalized model ( @xmath31 ) for motion of inertial particles in a fractional gaussian random velocity field and prove almost sure existence and uniqueness of particle paths .",
    "section 5 describes how to match desired statistical properties , in particular a favoured energy spectrum of the velocity field .",
    "further , we verify in section 6 that the system ( @xmath31 ) defines a random dynamical system , which admits a random pullback attractor .",
    "finally , we visualize the random attractor through a numerical experiment in section 7 .",
    "+ in the whole article we use the following conventions : if @xmath39 is a banach space , then we denote by @xmath40 the norm of @xmath39 and by @xmath41 the inner product of @xmath39 , if @xmath39 is even a hilbert space . in the cases",
    "@xmath42 for some @xmath43 or @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the two  dimensional torus , we just write @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the norm and inner product , respectively .",

    "since solutions of the navier  stokes equations for very turbulent fluids , i.e. at large _ reynolds numbers _",

    "indeed , ( [ sec2-eq3 ] ) implies @xmath100 and therefore by ( [ sec2-eq1 ] ) we deduce @xmath101 in the inertial subrange along the time axis . for a discussion under which conditions the frozen turbulence hypothesis is valid , see @xcite . + note that due to our derivation the properties ( [ sec2-eq2 ] ) and ( [ sec2-eq4 ] ) are closely related to each other !",
    "+ now comparing ( [ sec2-eq4 ] ) with the statistical property @xmath102 of the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xmath103 with hurst parameter @xmath0 indicates that it is reasonable to model the random velocity field @xmath80 with noise driven by a fbm . with this motivation shao @xcite , sreenivasan et al .",
