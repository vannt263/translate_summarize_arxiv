    "the inert doublet model  @xcite ( idm ) is one of the simplest extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , yet it is also one of the most versatile .",
    "this scenario , in which the usual sm fields are supplemented by a single scalar @xmath7 doublet which does not contribute to electroweak - symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and couples to the gauge - boson sector but not the fermion sector , has a wealth of potential phenomenological applications .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing of these stems from the recent observation  @xcite that the fields of this additional scalar doublet can provide a positive contribution to the oblique @xmath8 parameter  @xcite sufficient to render a sm higgs mass of @xmath9  gev consistent with precision data  @xcite .",
    "a host of other potential applications for inert doublets exist as well .",
    "these range from explaining the lightness of neutrino masses via a one - loop radiative see - saw mechanism  @xcite to the loop - level induction of electroweak - symmetry breaking  @xcite to engineering successful grand unification  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model yields a natural dark matter candidate in the form of the lightest inert particle ( lip ) , whose absolute stability is guaranteed by an unbroken @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "studies of the relic abundance of lip dark matter  @xcite , as well as its prospects for indirect detection via neutrino  @xcite , cosmic - ray positron and antiproton  @xcite , and gamma - ray  @xcite signatures , and for direct detection  @xcite have also been performed .",
    "since the coupling structure of the fields of the additional scalar doublet in the idm differs from that of typical two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) in the manner discussed above , the collider phenomenology of the idm also differs markedly from that of such 2hdm .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate the prospects for detecting the additional fields of the idm via their decay signatures at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dilepton ( plus missing energy ) channel , which turns out to be one of the most auspicious channels in terms of its discovery potential",
    ". some preliminary , parton - level studies of this channel have been conducted  @xcite within one particular region of parameter space . here , we present a more comprehensive , detector - level analysis in which we investigate a variety of different benchmark regions motivated by dark - matter studies , etc .",
    ", and assess the prospects for observing a @xmath11 signal at the lhc in each regime .",
    "we note that the results of this analysis , although conducted in the context of the idm , should also be applicable to other extensions of the sm with similarly - modified scalar sectors , as long as the extra scalars in those extensions have similar decay patterns to those in the idm .",
    "we begin in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] with a recapitulation of the inert doublet model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] , we summarize the theoretical and experimental constraints to which the model is subject .",
    "we outline a set of representative benchmark points which correspond to phenomenologically interesting regions of the parameter space in which all of these constraints are satisfied . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cuts ] , we discuss dilepton production in the idm , as well as the sm backgrounds for @xmath11 at the lhc , and we outline the event - selection criteria we use to differentiate signal events from those produced by these backgrounds .",

    "[ sec : results ] , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "the inert doublet model is an extension of the sm in which the higgs sector comprises two scalar @xmath7 doublets .",
    "the first of these doublets , here denoted @xmath12 , resembles the sm higgs doublet @xmath13 .",
    "it bears full responsibility for electroweak - symmetry breaking and its neutral component acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) equal to that of the sm higgs : @xmath14  gev .",
    "it also couples to quarks and leptons in precisely the way @xmath13 does in the sm .",
    "the second doublet , here denoted @xmath15 , does not contribute to ewsb ( @xmath16 ) , nor does it have yukawa interactions with the sm quarks and leptons .",
    "this coupling structure is enforced by a @xmath10 symmetry under which @xmath17 and all the sm fields transform trivially .",
    "this symmetry , sometimes called matter parity , remains unbroken in the vacuum , since @xmath18=0 .",
    "the most general @xmath19-even scalar potential allowed by this @xmath10 symmetry is @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{eq : v}\\ ] ]    after ewsb is triggered by the vev of @xmath12 , the scalar spectrum of the model comprises the usual sm higgs @xmath21 ( the neutral , @xmath19-even degree of freedom in @xmath12 ) , as well as four additional fields corresponding to the four degrees of freedom in @xmath15 .",
    "these include a pair of charged scalars @xmath22 , a neutral , @xmath19-even scalar @xmath23 , and a neutral , @xmath19-odd scalar @xmath24 .",
    "the masses of these scalars , given in terms of the six free parameters appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) is fixed by the constraint @xmath25 from ewsb . ]",
    "@xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , are @xmath27 for our purposes , it will be useful to parametrize the model using the alternative parameter set @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this parameterization is particularly useful in that it characterizes the model in terms of physically significant quantities such as particle masses , mass splittings , and @xmath32 : the coefficient which controls the trilinear @xmath33 and quartic @xmath34 couplings .",
    "the assumption of an unbroken @xmath10 matter parity renders at least one of the degrees of freedom in @xmath15 absolutely stable .",
    "if this particle is electrically neutral ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 in the idm ) , it becomes a good weakly - interacting - massive - particle ( wimp ) dark - matter candidate .",
    "for the remainder of this work , we will assume that the lip is the @xmath19-even scalar @xmath23 , and hence @xmath35 .",
    "the phenomenology of the alternative scenario , in which the @xmath19-odd scalar @xmath24 plays the role of the lip , is very similar .",
    "a variety of considerations , stemming both from theoretical consistency conditions and from experimental bounds , constrain the idm .",
    "below , we briefly summarize these constraints , which were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    *",
    "* perturbativity : * @xmath36 * * vacuum stability : * @xmath37 * * limits from direct collider searches : * + first of all , the excellent agreement between the experimentally - measured values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 obtained from lep and tevatron data  @xcite and the predictions of the sm requires that @xmath40 in order that the decays @xmath41 and @xmath42 are kinematically forbidden .",
    "+ second of all , bounds on the invisible decays of the higgs boson from lep data  @xcite also serve to constrain scenarios in which the higgs is light and @xmath43 . in this work , however , we will be primarily concerned with cases in which @xmath44  gev , for which the bounds from the searches on invisible higgs decay does not apply .",
    "+ third and finally , one can consider limits arising from direct searches for @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath23 , both at lep and at the tevatron  @xcite . it should first be noted that the standard limits on additional charged and neutral higgs scalars do not apply , because the standard search channels from which they are derived generally involve the couplings of such scalars to fermions , which are absent in the idm . on the other hand , bounds derived from the non - observation of @xmath45  @xcite and @xmath46",
    "@xcite decays in supersymmetric models can be used to constrain the idm parameter space , since @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the idm lead to similar signals .",
    "a detailed analysis of the constraints on @xmath47 in the idm based on lep  ii searches for @xmath45 was conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that regions of parameter space with @xmath49  gev and @xmath50  gev for @xmath51  gev had been ruled out . for @xmath52 gev , however , only the lep  i constraint @xmath53 applies .",
    "a rough bound of @xmath54  gev  @xcite can also be derived from the lep @xmath46 limit by making the necessary modifications to account for the difference in cross - section between fermion - pair and scalar - pair production .",
    "taking these considerations into account , we will henceforth restrict our attention to models for which @xmath55  gev . *",
    "* electroweak precision constraints : * + electroweak precision measurements set limits on contributions from the additional higgs doublet to the oblique @xmath23 and @xmath8 parameters  @xcite .",
    "we consider a given parameter choice to be consistent with electroweak precision constraints as long as the overall values of @xmath23 and @xmath8 it yields , once all contributions are taken into account , lie within the 68%  c.l .",
    "ellipse determined by the lep electroweak working group  @xcite . for a light sm higgs , with @xmath56 gev , the constraint is weak as long as @xmath57 and @xmath58 are of roughly the same order . for a heavy sm higgs ,",
    "a large splitting between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is preferred , and @xmath59 . *",
    "* dark matter relic density : * + one of the attractive aspects of the inert doublet model is that it can provide a viable wimp dark matter candidate in the form of a stable , neutral lip . the model is therefore constrained by experimental limits on the relic density of dark matter in the universe . in",
    "what follows , we will assume that the lip relic density represents the dominant component of @xmath60 and falls within the @xmath3 range of the dark - matter density of the universe as measured by wmap  @xcite , only the upper bound applies .",
    "] : @xmath61 .",
    "a detailed examination of the relic density of a @xmath19-even scalar lip in the idm was conducted in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the correct dark - matter relic density could be realized in several distinct regions of parameter space in which all the aforementioned theoretical and experimental constraints were also satisfied . for a light sm higgs with @xmath62  gev ,",
    "two scenarios are possible .",
    "the first of these involves a light lip with @xmath63  gev and mass splittings @xmath64 and @xmath65 which are sizeable , but of the same order .",
    "the second involves a heavier dark matter particle with @xmath66 gev and relatively small mass splittings . for a heavy sm higgs with @xmath67 gev ,",
    "the regions which the constraints leave open are those in which @xmath68  gev and @xmath59 , with both @xmath57 and @xmath58 relatively large , or @xmath69  gev , @xmath52 gev with a large @xmath57 .",
    ".a list of benchmark points used in our analysis , defined in terms of the model parameters @xmath70 .",
    "dark matter relic density and collider phenomenology of the idm depend little on @xmath71 , which is set to 0.1 for all benchmark points",
    ". the points lh1",
    "@xmath72 lh5 involve a light ( @xmath73 ) higgs boson , while the points hh1 @xmath72 hh3 involve a heavy ( @xmath74 ) higgs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us now turn to examine the results for each of the individual benchmark scenarios in our study in more detail .",
    "we begin with the lh1 , which involves a light higgs boson , a light lip ( @xmath75  gev ) , and a large mass splitting ( @xmath76 gev @xmath77 ) .",
    "the dominant backgrounds in this scenario are those from @xmath78 and @xmath79 , each of which also involves the leptonic decay of an on - shell @xmath80 and is therefore difficult to differentiate from the signal process on the basis of kinematical variables .",
    "the remaining backgrounds are efficiently suppressed after the imposition of the @xmath81 cut near the @xmath6 window . with @xmath82 of integrated luminosity",
    ", a significance level of @xmath83 could be obtained in this benchmark scenario .",
    "the situation for the heavy - higgs benchmark hh1 is similar ; however the smaller @xmath84-production cross - section in this case ( due primarily to an increased lip mass ) translates into a lower statistical significance .",
    "benchmark point lh2 also includes a @xmath0  gev dark matter particle , but involves a smaller mass splitting than that of lh1 : @xmath85  gev .",
    "this scenario affords the best opportunity for discovery at the lhc out of any of the benchmark points in our analysis , yielding a statistical significance of @xmath86 with @xmath5 of integrated luminosity .",
    "two factors contribute to its success : a small production threshold @xmath87 , and the fact that @xmath88 , which implies that the @xmath19-odd scalar @xmath24 decays via an off - shell @xmath80 .",
    "the latter consideration makes it possible to eliminate @xmath78 and @xmath79 background contributions quite efficiently by setting @xmath89 comfortably below the @xmath80 pole .",
    "further cuts on the angular variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 serve to reduce the remaining backgrounds to a manageable level .",
    "after all cuts are imposed , events from the low-@xmath81 tail of the @xmath78 distribution form the dominant background .",
    "it should be noted , however , that while the aforementioned angular - separation cuts are quite efficient in reducing background events , this efficiency comes with a price : the cuts also eliminate a substantial fraction of signal events .",
    "this explains why the signal cross - section for lh2 is less than that for lh1 , as no angular separation cuts are imposed in the latter scenario .",
    "benchmarks lh3 and lh4 are superficially similar , given that they involve a similar lip mass @xmath92  gev and the same mass splitting @xmath93 gev . in this case , however , the marked difference in @xmath57  a parameter which generally has little effect on observability of the dilepton signal in the @xmath84 associated - production channel  between the two points has a substantial impact on their collider phenomenology .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first of all , since @xmath94 for lh4 ( unlike any other benchmark in our analysis ) , the decay channels @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes either four jets , two jets and a single charged lepton , or two charged leptons , are open in this scenario , with a branching ratio @xmath97 . as a result , @xmath98 , and thus the dilepton signal cross - section ,",
    "are reduced by an additional factor of two relative to those points for which such competing decays are kinematically prohibited .",
    "second of all , as discussed above , the small value for @xmath99 gev in lh4 allows the additional contribution of @xmath100 process to the signal due to the unobservable soft jets and leptons from @xmath22 decay .",
    "these additional contributions augment the overall signal cross - section and more than compensate for the diminished @xmath101 , as discussed above . for @xmath5 of integrated luminosity , a significance level greater than @xmath3 could be reached for lh4 as well as lh3 .",
    "the final light - higgs scenario in our analysis , lh5 , turns out to be the most difficult benchmark point for which to observe a dilepton signal , primarily because of the small mass splitting @xmath102  gev between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the charged leptons in the final state tend to be extremely soft , and consequently the signal remains buried under the sm background even after an optimized set of level  iii cuts is applied .",
    "scenarios with a small value of @xmath58 will in general be difficult to discover via this channel at the lhc .",
    "it should be noted that the results we obtain for this benchmark differ significantly from the parton - level results quoted in  @xcite for a similar benchmark scenario , also with @xmath102  gev .",
    "the discrepancy owes primarily to our imposition of a level i cut of @xmath103 cut designed to replicate the effect of electron and muon isolation requirements at the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "since the angular separation between the lepton momenta tends to be extremely small for such a small value of @xmath58 , a vast majority of signal events will have @xmath104 and hence be eliminated by this cut .",
    "let us now turn to discuss the benchmark points which feature a heavy ( @xmath105 gev ) higgs boson  in other words , those benchmarks for which the idm successfully addresses the lep paradox .",
    "while the electroweak precision constraints discussed in sect .  [ sec : constraints ] are more stringent in this case , these constraints primarily affect @xmath57 , which is typically required to be quite large .",
    "since this parameter generally does not affect results in the dilepton channel , which depend primarily on @xmath106 and @xmath58 , the same qualitative results obtained for the light - higgs benchmarks also apply here . for hh1 , with @xmath76 gev , a significance level of only @xmath107 can be achieved with @xmath5 of integrated luminosity , due to both the overwhelming sm backgrounds that exist for dilepton processes involving on - shell @xmath80 decay , and a suppressed signal cross - section relative to benchmark lh1 ( which has a far lighter lip ) . for hh3  a benchmark with a somewhat small value of @xmath58  a @xmath108  gev cut helps to cut down the sm backgrounds from processes involving on - shell @xmath80 decay .",
    "it is , however , hard to improve upon the statistical significance by implementing additional cuts .",
    "the remaining background events which survive this cut ( most of which come from @xmath109 ) tend to have similar @xmath90 and @xmath91 distributions to those of the signal  a situation which makes the application of further , angular cuts essentially redundant .",
    "furthermore , since the missing - energy distribution for the signal events in scenarios with small @xmath58 peaks at relatively low values of @xmath110 , there is little to be gained by increasing @xmath111 much beyond the level  ii threshold of @xmath112  gev .",
    "by contrast , in scenarios with larger @xmath58 , an elevated missing - energy cut works quite effectively in tandem with the angular cuts in reducing backgrounds from @xmath109 and @xmath113 .",
    "a significance level of @xmath114 is reached for hh3 with @xmath5 of integrated luminosity .",
    "it is benchmark hh2 , however , which affords the best opportunity for discovery at the lhc from among the heavy - higgs scenarios , with a statistical significance of @xmath115 at @xmath5 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this is because the signal for this benchmark can be distinguished from the @xmath79 and @xmath78 backgrounds on the basis of @xmath81 cuts , and from the remaining @xmath109 , @xmath116 , and @xmath113 backgrounds on the basis of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath110 cuts in the same manner as for the low - higgs - mass point lh2 .",
    "we therefore conclude that even scenarios in which the idm permits an evasion of the lep upper bound on @xmath117 can yield an observable dilepton signal at the lhc .    from the results in table  [ tab : bmxsecscutiii ] ,",
    "it is evident that the prospects for detecting a signal in the dilepton channel in the idm model hinge primarily on two criteria .",
    "the first of these is the dependence of the cross - section for @xmath118 on @xmath87 and @xmath58 .",
    "this cross - section is , of course , larger in cases where the pair - production threshold energy @xmath87 is small . among cases with similar values of @xmath87 ,",
    "those in which @xmath58 is smaller will have larger production cross - sections .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the partonic cross - section for this process depends on @xmath106 and @xmath58 in the following way : @xmath119^{3/2}.    \\label{eq : partonicxsec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for values of @xmath120 , for which the dependence of this expression on @xmath106 and @xmath58 is non - negligible , it is apparent that for fixed @xmath121 , @xmath122 decreases with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "this accounts for the difference between the @xmath123 production cross - sections for benchmarks lh1 and hh3 quoted in table  [ tab : bmxsecs ] .",
    "the second criterion is the relationship between @xmath58 and @xmath6 : cases in which @xmath88 tend to have a higher statistical significance than those in which @xmath124 , as is manifest from comparing the results for benchmarks lh2 and lh1 in table  [ tab : bmxsecscutiii ] .",
    "this is because in the latter case , it is difficult to distinguish the signal process from the dominant @xmath78 background on the basis of event topology . on the other hand , when @xmath58 is exceedingly small ( as it is in our lh5 scenario ) , the charged leptons will be so soft that the detector - acceptance ( i.e.  level  i ) cuts will eliminate the vast majority of would - be signal events , as discussed above . between these extremes ,",
    "a window of @xmath125 emerges within which the prospects for observing a signal are quite good , so long as the lip mass also falls roughly within the @xmath2  gev range .",
    "for cases in which @xmath126 , the prospects for discovery at the lhc are reasonable  meaning a statistical significance around the @xmath3 level with 100 @xmath127 of integrated luminosity  only if the dark - matter particle is light ( @xmath75  gev ) .",
    "it is not difficult simultaneously to satisfy the constraints discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] and to realize a @xmath58 value within this mass window of @xmath2  gev while keeping the lip mass relatively light ( @xmath49 gev )  or , alternatively , to obtain a large mass splitting @xmath128 and a light lip mass of around 40  gev .",
    "this is true not only in models where the higgs boson is light and the parameters of the theory comparatively unconstrained , but also in cases in which the mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite for evading electroweak precision bounds on the higgs mass is realized in nature , and @xmath129  gev . in either case",
    ", it would be possible to observe a dilepton signal at the lhc at a significance level of @xmath3 or higher , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath5 .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the potential for observing a dilepton signature in the inert doublet model at the lhc .",
    "we have explored the prospects for a number of benchmark scenarios , including several in which the idm successfully ameliorates the lep paradox and the higgs - boson mass can be elevated as high as @xmath130  gev , as well as several of the dark - matter motivated scenarios cataloged in ref .",
    "we have shown that for cases in which the dark matter candidate is relatively light ( @xmath2  gev ) and @xmath131 gev , a signal with a significance of more than @xmath3 should be apparent at the lhc with less than @xmath5 of integrated luminosity . moreover , in cases when the lip is on the lighter end of this range , a @xmath3 discovery would be possible with only @xmath132 of integrated luminosity .",
    "in addition , there are also certain cases in which @xmath124 and the lip is light ( @xmath75  gev ) for which the prospects for detection are also reasonably good .",
    "of course the observation of an excess in the @xmath133 channel alone , while exciting , is by no means conclusive evidence for the inert doublet model . indeed , many models of beyond - the - standard - model physics lead to such a signature , including weak - scale supersymmetry , two - higgs - doublet models , etc .",
    "fortunately , evidence for the idm can come from a number of other sources .",
    "some of these sources involve other channels associated with the sm - like higgs at the lhc .",
    "one potentially interesting signal could arise due to deviations of the decay properties of the higgs boson @xmath21 from those of a sm higgs . in situations",
    "in which @xmath134 , for example , @xmath135 can contribute substantially to the invisible higgs width .",
    "searches for the weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) process @xmath136 , with @xmath21 decaying invisibly , can be used effectively to identify a higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite , and preliminary studies  @xcite indicate that a @xmath137 discovery should be possible with only @xmath132 of integrated luminosity in regions of parameter space where @xmath138 is large . moreover , if @xmath139 , the tetralepton + @xmath140 signatures resulting from decays of the form @xmath141 may also be detectable in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "the observation of signals of this sort , along with the non - observation of other signals which appear in standard 2hdm due to @xmath142 couplings ( where @xmath143 and @xmath144 and @xmath145 are sm fermions ) absent in the inert doublet model , could together serve to distinguish the idm from other scenarios for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "evidence for the idm could also come from a a variety of other sources , including dark - matter - direct - detection experiments and from the observation of energetic gamma - rays  @xcite or neutrinos  @xcite resulting from lip dark matter annihilation .",
    "clearly , the particular set of signals that an inert doublet would manifest differs substantially , depending on which of the allowed regions of parameter space the model happened to inhabit , and as we have shown , the @xmath11 channel can provide an important probe into which region that might be .",
