    "the structure of density and velocity fields in giant molecular clouds can be characterized by extended power laws ( e.g. heyer and brunt 2004 ; padoan et al .",

    "kritsuk et al .",
    "2007 , 2009a , b ) .",
    "the existence of these scaling laws and of one - point statistics of turbulent flows ( for example the probability distribution of gas density ) is an important assumption in statistical theories of star formation aimed at the prediction of the stellar initial mass function ( padoan and nordlund 2002 , 2004 ; hannebelle and chabrier 2008 , 2009 ) and the star formation rate ( krumholz and mckee 2005 ; padoan and nordlund 2009 ) .    is this assumption of a universal large - scale turbulent cascade valid in cluster - forming regions , believed to be the birthplace of most stars , or is the turbulence there driven internally by stellar outflows ? as an alternative to the idea that stellar clusters are formed in one crossing time ( elmegreen 2000 ) , tan , krumholz , and mckee ( 2006 ) propose that stars are formed in protocluster clumps over several dynamical times , while the turbulence is driven by stellar outflows .",
    "this scenario is investigated analytically by matzner ( 2007 ) and numerically by nakamura and li ( 2007 ) , carroll et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "nakamura and li ( 2007 ) find that the velocity power spectrum in their outflow - driven simulation is very shallow above a characteristic scale of energy injection by outflows , @xmath7 .",
    "they derive @xmath8  pc , assuming their computational domain has a size @xmath9  pc and a total mass @xmath10  m@xmath11 , characteristic of cluster - forming regions .",
    "this value of @xmath5 and the flattening of the power spectrum at larger scales is consistent with the analytical results in matzner ( 2007 ) .",
    "carroll et al .",
    "( 2009 ) confirm the results of nakamura and li ( 2007 ) at higher numerical resolution , producing velocity power spectra even more clearly peaked at the outflow driving scale . with the values of mass ,",

    "the injection scale is only weakly dependent on @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the star formation rate , and is approximately given by @xmath16  pc , where @xmath17 is the column density in g/@xmath18 .",
    "our conclusions do not critically depend on a precise knowledge of @xmath5 , as long as scales just above @xmath5 are resolved in the observations .    the prototype of outflow - driven cluster - forming regions chosen by nakamura and li ( 2007 ) , matzner ( 2007 ) , and carroll et al .",

    ", we derive the power spectrum of integrated intensity , @xmath19 , and velocity , @xmath20 , in ngc  1333 , based on the data from the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) survey of the perseus molecular cloud complex ( ridge et al .",
    "2006 ) , publicly available from the complete website .",
    "we show that the scale @xmath5 is resolved by the observations , and both power spectra , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are consistent with power laws extending to large scale , with the same slope found in supersonic turbulence simulations and in the perseus complex on larger scale ( padoan et al .",
    "the constant slopes of @xmath20 and @xmath19 above the scale @xmath5 suggest that outflows may not be the dominant driving mechanism .",
    "in a recent paper appeared after the submission of this letter , brunt , heyer , and mac low ( 2009 ) have reached the same conclusion for ngc  1333 and for other molecular cloud regions using a different method .",
    "we first confirm the validity of the velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) method of lazarian and pogosyan ( 2006 ) , using synthetic maps of the @xmath21=1 - 0 line of @xmath0co , computed with a non - lte radiative transfer code ( juvela and padoan 2005 ) , based on the density and velocity fields from a snapshot of a simulation of supersonic hydrodynamic turbulence with rms mach number @xmath22=6 .",
    "these synthetic maps are the same used by padoan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to test the vca method of lazarian and pogosyan ( 2000 ) ( padoan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) applied the vca method to the full fcrao perseus map and found a power law turbulent energy spectrum , @xmath23 , with the exponent @xmath24 ) .",
    "the simulation is carried out with the _ enzo _ code , developed at the laboratory for computational astrophysics by bryan , norman and collaborators ( norman and bryan 1999 ) .",
    "_ enzo _ is a public domain eulerian grid - based code ( see http://lca.ucsd.edu/projects/enzo ) that adopts the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of colella and woodward ( 1984 ) .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state , periodic boundary conditions , initially uniform density and random large - scale velocity .",
    "the turbulence is forced in fourier space only in the wavenumber range @xmath25 , where @xmath26 corresponds to the size of the computational domain that contains @xmath27 computational zones ( for details see kritsuk et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations assume a box size of 5  pc , a mean density of @xmath28  @xmath29 , a mean kinetic temperature of 10  k , an rms mach number @xmath22=6 ( consistent with the turbulence simulation ) and a uniform @xmath0co abundance of @xmath30 .",
    "these values were chosen as a generic reference model , not tailored to the perseus molecular cloud complex .",
    "the density and velocity data cubes are resampled from @xmath27 to @xmath31 zones .",
    "the resampling of the data cubes has several advantages : i ) it yields density and velocity fields with power spectra that are power laws almost up to the new nyquist frequency ; ii ) it speeds up the radiative transfer calculations ; iii ) it generates a map of synthetic spectra with a range of scales comparable to that of the map of ngc  1333 .    as a result of the radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "we compute three maps ( one in each of the three axis directions ) of spectral profiles of the @xmath0co ( @xmath21=1 - 0 ) line intensity , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the map position and @xmath34 the velocity channel .",
    "we compute @xmath32 for 280 velocity channels and @xmath35 map positions , so we obtain a position - position - velocity data cube of @xmath36 elements , for each of the three coordinate directions .",
    "the width of the velocity channels is @xmath37  km / s , giving a total velocity range of 7  km / s across the 280 channels .",
    "the integrated intensity , @xmath38 , is a two - dimensional map obtained as the sum of the line intensity over all the velocity channels , multiplied by the channel width , @xmath39 .",
    "we call @xmath19 the two - dimensional power spectrum of the integrated intensity map , @xmath38 , and approximate it with a power law fit such that , @xmath40 .",
    "we then call @xmath41 the energy spectrum , given by @xmath42 , where @xmath20 is the three dimensional power spectrum of the velocity field , also assumed to be a power law , @xmath23",
    ". the vcs method of lazarian and pogosyan ( 2006 ) allows the determination of the energy spectrum ( the exponent @xmath43 ) , directly from the one dimensional power spectrum in velocity space , @xmath44 , that is the power spectrum of individual spectral line profiles . to reduce the effect of instrumental noise and of intrinsic variations in the power spectrum across the map , a global power spectrum , @xmath45 ,",
    "is obtained as the sum of @xmath46 over a region of the map , @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 is the exponent of the velocity coordinate power spectrum , @xmath49 , the turbulent energy spectrum exponent is given by @xmath50 , if two conditions are satisfied : 1 ) a steep density power spectrum , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , and 2 ) small velocity wavenumbers , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the observational beam size , @xmath56 is the size of the mapped region , and @xmath57 is the exponent of the second order velocity structure function , @xmath58 .    the first condition , @xmath52 , is here approximated as @xmath59 , because the power spectrum of the integrated intensity , @xmath19 , is expected to provide a good estimate of the density power spectrum .",
    "this is confirmed by our study of the synthetic spectral maps ( see below ) , showing that @xmath50 while @xmath59 .",
    "the second condition means that the exponent @xmath48 must be evaluated only for large velocity scales ( small velocity wavenumbers ) relative to the characteristic turbulent velocity at the scale of the beam size , @xmath55 .",
    "we have made the velocity ( hence @xmath60 ) nondimensional , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the total number of velocity channels used to compute the power spectrum , and have defined the velocity wavenumber as @xmath63 , so @xmath64 corresponds to the total velocity range used to compute the power spectrum . because the characteristic turbulent velocity scales as @xmath65 , the velocity wavenumber scales as @xmath66 , explaining the dependence of @xmath67 on the beam size , @xmath55 .    before computing the power spectra",
    ", we apply a gaussian beam with fwhm=@xmath68 , where @xmath68 is the numerical mesh size , and add gaussian noise to the synthetic spectra , to a level comparable to that of the fcrao map of ngc  1333 .",
    "the power spectra @xmath19 and @xmath45 are shown for all three directions in figures  1 and 2 respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is very well described by a power law in the approximate range @xmath69 ( @xmath26 corresponds to the linear size of the computational domain ) .",
    "averaging the results of the three maps , we obtain the exponent @xmath70 , where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the three measurements , a little larger than the standard deviation of each of the three individual least squares fits . in padoan",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) we measured the same power spectrum , but without adding noise to the synthetic maps , and only in the direction of the x - axis .",
    "we obtained a slope of @xmath71 , consistent with the slope of @xmath72 found here for the same direction .",
    "this slope is also consistent with that of the density power spectrum measured directly from the three - dimensional snapshot , @xmath73 .",
    "the least squares fits to the @xmath45 spectra are computed in the range @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , to satisfy the second condition for the validity of the vcs method . as shown in figure  2 , the power spectra @xmath45 are power laws up to @xmath76 , and become steeper at larger values of @xmath60 , as predicted by the theory .",
    "the steepening is here reduced by the effect of the added noise .",
    "because the condition @xmath59 is satisfied , we derive the energy spectrum from the relation @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain @xmath77 , where the uncertainty is the standard deviation    of the exponents from the three maps .",
    "this result is consistent with the slope of 1.8 derived directly from the three - dimensional velocity field of the simulation snapshot .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is very close to the value of 3 that separates the regimes of steep and shallow density power spectra discussed in lazarian and pogosyan ( 2000 , 2006 ) .",
    "this is not a problem , because in the case of shallow density power spectra , the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath48 would be either the same or @xmath79 , depending on some other condition .",
    "the two formulas give the same result for @xmath80 .",
    "we conclude that the vcs method provides a precise estimate of the turbulent energy spectrum , by fitting the slope of @xmath45 for @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath60 range of the power law is limited .",
    "it is only a factor of 10 for the synthetic maps ( and only a factor of 4 for the map of ngc  1333 ) , because it is essentially given by the spatial dynamical range ( 256 for the synthetic maps ) to the power @xmath81 , as explained above .",
    "however , the average of the power spectra over many positions on the map ( @xmath35 for both the synthetic maps and the map of ngc  1333 ) , yields a @xmath45 spectrum that is extremely smooth and very well approximated by a power law , providing an accurate estimate of the slope of the turbulent energy spectrum .",
    "we now apply the vcs method to the j=1 - 0 @xmath0co survey of the perseus molecular cloud complex carried out with the fcrao 14  m antenna by ridge et al .",
    "the grid spacing of the survey is 23  , and the beam size 46  .",
    "the velocity - channel size is 0.06  km / s .",
    "we select a squared region of    100@xmath82100 arcmin , approximately centered on ngc  1333 .",
    "this region contains @xmath83 spectra , like the synthetic maps .",
    "figure  3 shows the integrated intensity map of that region . it also shows the size of @xmath84  pc and @xmath85  pc , the outflow injection scale and the size of the computational domain in nakamura and li ( 2007 ) and carroll et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , assuming a distance to ngc  1333 of @xmath86  pc . for this distance , the size of the map is @xmath87  pc , the grid spacing 0.03  pc , and the beam size @xmath88  pc .",
    "the injection scale is therefore well resolved .",
    "the uncertainty on the distance to ngc  1333 is not very large , 220  pc@xmath89350  pc ( borgman and blaauw 1964 ; herbig and jones 1983 ; cernis 1990 ) . even assuming the largest value of @xmath90  pc , @xmath5 would still be 4 times larger than the beam size .",
    "we compute the power spectra @xmath19 and @xmath45 within that region , without any correction for the effects of beam and noise .",
    "this is justified because we do not compute the least squares fit at very large values of @xmath60 and @xmath91 , and because we have confirmed the validity of the vcs method using synthetic maps where noise was added to a comparable level as in the map of ngc  1333 .",
    "the @xmath19 power spectrum is shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "the least squares fit , computed in the range @xmath92 , gives @xmath93 .",
    "the values of the wavenumbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 , corresponding to the scales @xmath84  pc and @xmath85  pc , are marked by two arrows .",
    "the power spectrum is an almost perfect power law in the range of wavenumbers @xmath96 , corresponding to the range of scales 0.16  pc@xmath67.9  pc ( @xmath26 corresponds to the size of the map ) , with no significant feature around @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the velocity coordinate power spectrum , @xmath45 , and its least squares fit in the range @xmath97 , giving @xmath98 .",
    "this is the range of @xmath60 values expected from the vcs theory , because here @xmath99 .",
    "as explained above , the dynamical range in @xmath60 is compressed with respect to that in @xmath91 , as shown by the positions of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , marked by two arrows . however , the measurement of the slope is still very accurate because the power spectrum is extremely smooth , as the result of averaging over the whole map , and very well represented by a power law .",
    "the injection scale falls in the very middle of the power law range , at @xmath102 , and there is no sign of a variation of the slope within a range of values of @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath103 , or 0.06  pc @xmath104  pc .    using the relation @xmath50",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 , where the standard deviation is now derived directly by that of the least squares fit for @xmath48 .",
    "this uncertainty may seem unrealistically small . using the synthetic maps we have derived a standard deviation of 0.04 from the three values of @xmath43 .",
    "if we instead derive the uncertainty directly from the standard deviation of each fit of @xmath48 , we find that the average of the three uncertainty is 0.02 , exactly like in the observational map .",
    "we therefore estimate that a more realistic uncertainty for the derived slope in ngc  1333 should be @xmath106 .    to further verify this result",
    ", we also select a smaller region of @xmath107  arcmin ( @xmath108  pc ) around ngc  1333 , shown as a dotted square in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath109 , corresponding to @xmath110 , consistent with the value estimated on the larger scale , though with a slightly larger uncertainty due to the smaller dynamical range and the smaller number of @xmath45 spectra in the map .",
    "the good consistency between the two maps is not surprising , because the sum of the @xmath45 spectra is dominated by the positions with the strongest integrated intensity that are mostly located within the inner map .",
    "we conclude that the vcs method yields a turbulent energy power spectrum with slope @xmath111 , in the range of scales 0.06  pc @xmath104  pc , with no evidence of internal driving by outflows at the scale @xmath84  pc .",
    "it has been suggested that protocluster clumps actively form stars for several dynamical times , while being supported by the turbulence internally generated by stellar outflows ( e.g. tan , krumholz , and mckee 2006 ) .",
    "this scenario is simulated by nakamura and li ( 2007 ) and carroll et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , with physical parameters characteristic of ngc  1333 .",
    "they find an energy injection scale , @xmath8  pc , above which the turbulent energy spectrum is very shallow , up to the size of 1.5  pc of their computational domain .",
    "this value of @xmath5 and the flattening of the power spectrum above that scale are consistent with the results of the analytical model of matzner ( 2007 ) .",
    "if the turbulence in cluster - forming regions is primarily driven by outflows , the turbulent energy spectrum should flatten above the scale @xmath5 , up to a scale where the external turbulent cascade dominates again .",
    "we have searched for such a feature in the energy spectrum of ngc  1333 , the prototype of outflow - driven regions in the cited theoretical works . to this aim",
    ", we have applied the vcs method of lazarian and pogosyan ( 2006 ) to the @xmath0co fcrao map of ngc  1333 , after successfully testing the method on simulated data .",
    "we have found the energy spectrum is a power law , @xmath23 , with @xmath111 , in the range of scales 0.06  pc @xmath2  pc , with no evidence of internal driving by outflows at @xmath84  pc .",
    "the power spectrum of integrated intensity is also a power law , @xmath40 , with @xmath112 , in the range of scales 0.16  pc@xmath67.9  pc , with no significant features above the predicted injection scale .",
    "these power spectra are consistent with those of large - scale driven simulations of supersonic turbulence , and with those measured on larger scale in perseus and other molecular cloud complexes .",
    "although outflows from young stars are present in ngc  1333 , the large - scale turbulent cascade appears to be the main energy source .",
    "the turbulence in ngc  1333 is either currently driven by significant mass inflow from larger scales , or in the process of being dissipated , until the time when winds , outflows , and ionizing radiation from stars will completely disperse the star - forming gas .",
