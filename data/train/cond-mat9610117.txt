    "critical behavior of the hard hexagon model on a triangular lattice is well known through its exact solution by using the corner transfer matrix @xcite . below a critical value of the activity @xmath0 , the system is in the disordered phase .",
    "therefore , a correlation function between hard hexagons decays exponentially there @xcite . above the critical value of the activity",
    ", the hexagons on the lattice condense and make an ordered configuration .",
    "the degeneracy of the ordered configuration is triplefold and the universality class of the critical point is the same as that of the three - state potts model @xcite . the fact that the hexagons are hard means that there is a restriction between the nearest - neighbor sites , such that , any two hexagons can not occupy neighboring two sites simultaneously on the triangular lattice .",
    "this property of the hard hexagon model can be regarded as the nearest - neighbor exclusion .",
    "adding to the nearest - neighbor exclusion , a next - nearest - neighbor exclusion causes fourfold degeneracy in the ground state .",
    "todo and suzuki @xcite claimed that the hard hexagon model with the next - nearest - neighbor exclusion belongs to the same universality class as that of the four - state potts model by means of the numerical study by using the phenomenological renormalization group method and the conformal invariance .",
    "recently , it was found that an antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath1 ising model on the triangular lattice has a relation with the hard hexagon model with many restrictions for configurations of hexagons @xcite .",
    "the phase transition as a function of @xmath1 in the ground state of the spin-@xmath1 ising model was studied by using a mapping from the ground state degeneracy of the system at zero temperature to a partition function of a spin-1/2 system at a pseudo temperature @xcite ; the mapped system is called a @xmath2 model .",
    "the original @xmath3 ising model was exactly solved and it is well known that the system is critical with @xmath4 at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "nagai et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the critical index @xmath5 decreases from 1/2 for @xmath3 when the spin @xmath1 increases from @xmath3 .",
    "it has been clarified that @xmath5 becomes zero at @xmath6 discontinuously @xcite .",
    "this behavior of @xmath5 suggests an appearance of a partial long - rang order for the system with @xmath7 ; it was shown explicitly for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we remind that the @xmath2 model is the hard hexagon model with many kinds of restrictions @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the usual hard hexagon model which does not have any extra restrictions but only the nearest - neighbor repulsion , the @xmath2 model is critical for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce a new hard hexagon model ; we call it a magnetic hard hexagon model . the magnetic hard hexagon model with up to the third - nearest - neighbor repulsions is investigated by monte carlo simulations and a finite size scaling for evaluation of @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the new hard hexagon model has an ordered phase , a critical phase and the disordered phase .",
    "we discuss a relation of the new hard hexagon model with the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice .    in section [ sec : model ] ,",
    "we introduce the magnetic hard hexagon model with exclusions up to the third - nearest - neighbor sites with relation to the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the triangular lattice . in section [ sec : result ] , we show our results about a phase diagram of our new model and discuss these results . concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us introduce a magnetic hard hexagon model which is related to a representation of the ground state degeneracy for the spin-@xmath1 ising model on an antiferromagnetic triangular lattice ( atl ) .",
    "the `` occupation number '' of magnetic hard hexagons is denoted by @xmath10 at a site @xmath11 on the triangular lattice @xmath12 ; @xmath10 takes on @xmath13 . if the site @xmath11 is occupied by an `` up magnetic hard hexagon '' or by a `` down magnetic hard hexagon '' , then we assign them @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . if the site @xmath11 is empty",
    ", then we set @xmath16 .",
    "the ground partition function of the system is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and the products with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are taken over the nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , the next - nearest - neighbor pairs of sites and third - nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , respectively .",
    "we explain below a relation of @xmath22 with the ground state degeneracy of the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the atl . in this relation ,",
    "the activity denoted by @xmath23 is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the atl is written as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the interaction constant between nearest - neighbor sites denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath27 is a spin variable which takes a value on @xmath28 .",
    "it has been shown that the ground state degeneracy of this system is equivalent to a partition function of a spin-1/2 ising model as follows @xcite : @xmath29 where the summation for spin configurations @xmath30 is taken over the ground - states configurations of spin-1/2 ising model on the atl with @xmath31 : the energy of the system , @xmath32 , has to be @xmath33 .",
    "we recall that this is the partition function of the @xmath2 model @xcite .",
    "the linear size of the system is denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the total number of free spins and is expressed as follows : @xmath36 where in eq.([eq : totalhexagon ] ) the summation is over the set of sites in the lattice @xmath12 and in eq.([eq : hardhexagon ] ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 are sets of sites , each of them composed of three sites encircling the site @xmath39 as shown in fig.[fig : hardhexagon ] .",
    "when right bonds shown by thick lines are arranged in such a way given in fig.[fig : restr1 ] , the value of the function @xmath40 becomes 1 ; this means that a hexagon occupies the site @xmath39 .",
    "in this situation , the site @xmath41 can not be occupied by another hexagon , because the value of @xmath42 on the bond @xmath43 is @xmath44 and hence the value of @xmath45 is 0 .",
    "one can not put another hexagon on the site @xmath46 because the value @xmath47 is @xmath48 . by the same reasons as these for the sites @xmath41 and @xmath46 explained above , all of sites encircling the site @xmath39 can not be occupied by another hexagon when the site @xmath11 is occupied by a hexagon .",
    "therefore , we can regard @xmath40 as an occupation number of the hard hexagon .    in the partition function written in eq.([eq",
    ": pfunc1 ] ) , the summation is taken over the ground state spin configurations . if we regard the function @xmath40 of the spin configuration @xmath30 as a variable @xmath49 , the partition function is rewritten as a summation over configurations of hard hexagons @xmath50 as follows : @xmath51 where we define a function @xmath52 as @xmath53 the restriction for occupations of the nearest - neighbor sites , namely the nearest - neighbor exclusion , is included in the expression @xmath54 in eq.([eq : partf2 ] ) .",
    "one can write it explicitly as follows : @xmath55 comparing this form with the usual hard hexagon model with only the nearest - neighbor exclusion @xcite , one notices that @xmath24 plays a role of activity . when the partition function is expressed in terms of the occupation number of the hard hexagons",
    ", we can see that there are many other restrictions for configurations of hard hexagons than that for the nearest - neighbor sites . in order to embody some of these restrictions",
    ", we introduce a magnetic hard hexagon in the followings .",
    "let us define the `` occupation number '' of the magnetic hard hexagon @xmath56 as follows : @xmath57 by introducing the function @xmath56 , one can distinguish two types of hard hexagons ; one of them is given by @xmath58 and the other by @xmath59 .",
    "they correspond to @xmath14 and @xmath60 , respectively ; we call them an up magnetic hard hexagon for @xmath14 and a down magnetic hard hexagon for @xmath60 . regarding the occupation number of the magnetic hard hexagon as a variable similar to that in the usual hard hexagon",
    ", the partition function ( [ eq : partf21 ] ) can be rewritten by a sum over configurations of magnetic hard hexagons @xmath61 as follows : @xmath62 in this description , the factor @xmath63 gives extra exclusion conditions as for configurations of magnetic hard hexagons other than the nearest - neighbor exclusion .",
    "namely , the magnetic hard hexagons have in general next - nearest - neighbor exclusion , third - nearest - neighbor exclusion and so on , in addition to the nearest - neighbor exclusion .",
    "let us assume that a site @xmath39 is occupied by an up magnetic hard hexagon with @xmath64 as shown in fig.[fig : restr2 ]",
    ". since two sites @xmath41 and @xmath46 at the boundary between two hexagons located at @xmath65 and @xmath66 are connected by a right bond with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , an up magnetic hard hexagon with @xmath69 on the site at @xmath66 can exist with that with @xmath70 . however , following to the definition of magnetic hard hexagon defined by eq.([eq : magnetichh ] ) , the site at @xmath66 can not be occupied by a down magnetic hard hexagon with @xmath71 .",
    "the other five next - nearest - neighbor sites of @xmath65 are in a similar situation .",
    "thus we realize that there is a restriction between two magnetic hard hexagons on the next - nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we notice that there is another restriction due to the definition of magnetic hard hexagon as explained in fig.[fig : restr3 ] .",
    "assume that a site at @xmath65 is occupied by an up magnetic hard hexagon .",
    "when we put a magnetic hard hexagon at the site @xmath72 for example , this magnetic hard hexagon is in contact with the magnetic hard hexagon at @xmath65 on the site @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath64 , the value of spin at @xmath41 is @xmath73 . when the magnetic hard hexagon at @xmath72 has @xmath74 , the bond between sites @xmath41 and @xmath72 is not satisfied and hence the magnetic hard hexagons at the site @xmath65 and @xmath72 are not compatible . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic hard hexagon with @xmath75 is compatible with that with @xmath64 .",
    "other third - nearest - neighbor sites are in the same situation as that of the site @xmath72 .",
    "thus we have the restriction that a magnetic hard hexagon located at the third - nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath76 , of an occupied site @xmath11 , @xmath10 , has to have the reverse sign of that of @xmath10 ; @xmath77 .",
    "we have explained three kinds of restrictions for configurations of magnetic hard hexagons .",
    "although they originally stem from a definition of the magnetic hard hexagon as a function of spin configurations defined in eq.([eq : magnetichh ] ) , we can write them explicitly in terms of @xmath61 as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean the next - nearest - neighbor and the third - nearest - neighbor pairs , respectively . in the @xmath2 model for which its partition function is given by eq.([eq : partfmhh1 ] ) , there are many other restrictions than those two - body exclusions mentioned above . it is expected that those two - body exclusions give an important effect for a large value of the activity and hence the magnetic hard hexagons condense and make an ordered phase for large values of activity ; the large value of the activity corresponds to a large value of the spin .    we now propose a new magnetic hard hexagon model which has only three kinds of the two - body exclusions and investigate a critical behavior of the magnetic hard hexagon model ; the partition function of the new model is described as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the restrictions defined in eq.([eq : restrictions ] ) ; this is equivalent to that given by eq.([eq : pfrmhh ] ) .",
    "although the usual hard hexagon model with only the nearest - neighbor exclusion was solved exactly , it seems difficult to obtain an exact solution for the present new model .",
    "we therefore carry out monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for the model .",
    "we perform mc simulations at a finite temperature given by @xmath81 with a unit of the boltzmann constant @xmath82 .",
    "we used the metropolis dynamics to update configurations of the magnetic hard hexagon in the mc simulations .",
    "a finite size scaling method @xcite is used to estimate a critical index @xmath5 which describes a decay of correlation functions between hexagons separated by a long distance . the index @xmath5 is determined from @xmath83 where @xmath84,@xmath85 and @xmath86 mean three kinds of sublattice of the triangular lattice .",
    "we need two finite lattices at least to obtain the index @xmath5 from this relation as follows : @xmath87 in the present study , we set @xmath88 equal to 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 90 , 120 , respectively , in this order .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that a system is in a critical phase .",
    "if the system is in the disordered phase , @xmath5 estimated by this method would appear to be 2 .",
    "this value does not mean that the system is in a critical phase with the index @xmath89 but in the disordered phase .",
    "on the other hand , if the system is in an ordered phase , it should be zero .    in the present mc simulations , we used more than @xmath90 mc step per site for each system size .",
    "figure [ fig : et05115 ] shows results of size dependences of critical index @xmath5 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we observed that @xmath5 approaches to 2 in the thermodynamic limit for these values of activity .",
    "these results mean that the systems with these values of activity are in the disordered phase",
    ". for a small value of the activity , the density of magnetic hard hexagons is low and hence there are many lattice sites unoccupied by a magnetic hard hexagon .    in figs.[fig :",
    "et20275 ] and [ fig : et3035 ] , size dependences of the critical index @xmath5 are shown for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . for @xmath95 , the values of @xmath5 take finite values in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . since the values of @xmath5 are obviously less than 2 and actually less than 1/2 , the systems with these values of activity are in a critical phase .",
    "in contrast to the case with @xmath98 , two - body restrictions considered in our model play a role of providing a critical phase for @xmath95 . for @xmath99 and 7",
    ", we found that the value of @xmath5 becomes zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these results suggest an appearance of ordered phase at @xmath100 . from the relation of the present model with the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the atl , we have @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "note that the discrete value of activity , namely the value of spin where @xmath5 becomes zero is very close to that in the original spin system ; @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "this agreement , we think , is due to a dominant role of the two - body restrictions in the region of large activity , which gives high density of magnetic hard hexagons .    in fig.[fig :",
    "phases ] , we show a comparison of phase diagrams for the usual hard hexagon model , the magnetic hard hexagon model with two - body restrictions and the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the atl .",
    "the usual hard hexagon model with only the nearest - neighbor exclusion has two phase , that is , the disordered phase and the ordered phase .",
    "there is no critical phase in the usual hard hexagon model . on the other hand , the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the atl , which is equivalent to a magnetic hard hexagon model with many restrictions ,",
    "has the critical phase and the ordered phase .",
    "there is no disordered phase in the original spin-@xmath1 ising model .",
    "our new model investigated in the present paper has three phases , that is , the disordered phase , the critical phase and the ordered phase .",
    "the ground state degeneracy is sixfold .",
    "hence we expect that our new model belongs to the same universality class as that of six clock model .",
    "we have proposed a new model : a magnetic hard hexagon model with two - body exclusions .",
    "we have shown a relation of the new model and the spin-@xmath1 ising model on the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice .",
    "the phase diagram of the new model has investigated by evaluating the critical exponent @xmath5 by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "it turned out that the model has three phases , that is to say , the disordered phase for @xmath104 , the critical phase for @xmath95 and the ordered phase for @xmath105 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we notice that an upper critical value @xmath106 for the critical phase in the model is the same as the critical value of spin in the original spin-@xmath1 ising model .",
    "although the two - body restrictions considered in our new model are not sufficiently many restrictions when they are compared to those included in the original spin-@xmath1 system , namely the @xmath2 model , we saw they are enough to provide a critical phase , which does not exist in the usual hard hexagon model .",
    "we estimated in the present paper only the index @xmath5 to clarify the phase diagram of our new model .",
    "calculations of the other critical indices and estimations of more definite values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 are left as a future problem to understand the critical property of our new model .",
