    "the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) in ferromagnetic metals has been the subject of many studies since it was discovered more than a century ago@xcite .",
    "the effect describes the change of the electrical resistance in response to a change in the orientation of the magnetization .",
    "phenomenologically , amr has a non - crystalline component , arising from the lower symmetry for a specific current direction , and crystalline components arising from the crystal symmetries @xcite . in ferromagnetic metals",
    "the amr components have been extracted indirectly from experimental data by fitting the total angular dependences @xcite .",
    "the coefficients can be obtained by numerical _ ab initio _ transport calculations @xcite , but these have no clear connection to the standard physical model of transport arising from spin dependent scattering of current carrying low mass @xmath0-states into heavy - mass @xmath1-states @xcite .    in the dilute magnetic semiconductor ( ga ,",
    "mn)as , it has been observed that the amr consists of a non - crystalline component of the opposite sign ( compared to most ferromagnetic metals ) and typically much weaker crystalline terms reflecting the underlying magnetocrystalline anisotropies @xcite . in our recent work",
    "@xcite we developed experimental methods to yield directly the non - crystalline and crystalline components of the amr in ( ga , mn)as .",
    "numerical microscopic calculations were employed to calculate the amr components , achieving good agreement with experimental results .",
    "an analytical model was introduced to explain the physical origin of the amr terms , in particular to show that the sign of the non - crystalline term is determined by the ratio of the magnetic and non - magnetic components of the scattering potential . here",
    "we expand our previous work to include details of that analytical model and a detailed explanation of how the components of the amr can be separately extracted from the experimental data .",
    "25 nm and 5 nm ga@xmath2mn@xmath3as films were grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy onto a 330 nm ht - gaas buffer layer grown on a semi - insulating gaas(001 ) substrate .",
    "standard photolithography techniques were used to fabricate two sets of hall bars of width 45@xmath4 m with voltage probes separated by 285@xmath4 m , with the current along the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] , [ 110 ] and @xmath5 $ ] directions .",
    "the longitudinal resistance r@xmath6 and the hall resistance r@xmath7 were measured using four probe techniques with a dc current of 1@xmath4a .",
    "we also measured devices with a corbino geometry ( fig .",
    "1(d ) ) in which the current flows radially in the plane of the material .",
    "all measurements were made on as - grown material ( i.e. without annealing ) .",
    "magnetoresistances were measured with a saturating magnetic field of 1 t applied in the plane of the device , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the pure amr geometry with zero ( antisymmetric ) hall signal .",
    "magnetometry measurements were carried out using a commercial quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "figures 1(a ) and ( b ) show the fractional change in the resistivity , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for the hall bars fabricated from the 25 nm film for each current direction . here",
    "@xmath11 is the average value of the longitudinal resistance as the magnetic field is rotated through @xmath12 . in the following analysis",
    "we will show that this data can be decomposed into the form given by equations ( [ rho_xx ] ) and ( [ rho_xy ] ) .",
    "in the subsequent sections we aim to identify the origin of the particular contributions .",
    "the terms allowed by symmetry are obtained by extending the standard phenomenology @xcite , to systems with cubic [ 100 ] plus uniaxial [ 110 ] anisotropy : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 is the angle between the magnetization unit vector @xmath16 and the current @xmath17 , and @xmath18 the angle between @xmath16 and the [ 110 ] crystal direction .",
    "the four contributions are the non - crystalline term , the lowest order uniaxial and cubic crystalline terms , and a crossed non - crystalline / crystalline term .",
    "we have omitted the higher order terms in these expressions as these are found to be negligibly small in our devices .",
    "the purely crystalline terms are excluded by symmetry for the transverse amr and it is clear that @xmath9 and @xmath8 are not independent .",
    "the well known formulae for isotropic materials ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) correspond to @xmath19 and all other coefficients set to zero in equations ( [ rho_xx],[rho_xy ] ) .",
    "such formulae result also from equations ( [ rho_xx],[rho_xy ] ) averaged over @xmath18 with @xmath15 held constant , which corresponds to a polycrystal with randomly oriented grains .",
    "it is not possible to obtain each term separately by fitting equations ( [ rho_xx ] ) and ( [ rho_xy ] ) to the full ( @xmath18 ) angular data from one hall bar . in a @xmath5 $ ] oriented hall bar , for instance , @xmath20",
    ", the equations reduce to @xmath21 and @xmath22 . @xmath23 and @xmath24 could be determined only if @xmath25 . however , using different hall bar orientations , the anisotropy constants appear in other combinations so that they can all be extracted individually . in the present case , two hall bar orientations ( e.g. @xmath26 $ ] and",
    "@xmath5 $ ] ) suffice .",
    "measurements with other orientations are used as consistency checks .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows some examples of how the individual amr components can be extracted : the longitudinal resistivities in the @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] directions are subtracted to give a simple @xmath29 signal ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ rho_xx ] ) with amplitude @xmath30 and",
    "this is the same as the difference of transverse resistivities in the @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] samples .",
    "a @xmath31 signal with amplitude @xmath32 can be obtained through other combinations of the data .",
    "the close agreement obtained by using different combinations to extract the same coefficients highlights the consistency between the data and our phenomenological analysis , and also attests to the homogeneity and quality of the mbe grown gamnas wafer .",
    "the purely crystalline terms can be extracted from the combination of the measurements from two orthogonal bars .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) for our data . in principle",
    ", the same signals could be extracted directly from a single experimental measurement by appropriate wiring of an @xmath33-shaped hall bar .",
    "alternatively , the same coefficients can be extracted directly from the data obtained from the corbino geometry , fig .",
    "2(b ) . as the current flows in all radial directions ,",
    "the non - crystalline terms are averaged to zero@xcite .",
    "it would be problematic to perform such measurements with ferromagnetic metals because , in order to define the corbino geometry it is required that the source - drain resistance be large compared to the contact resistances .",
    "this condition is met with ( ga , mn)as .",
    "again , we obtain excellent agreement for the same coefficients extracted from different combinations of devices .    figure 3(a ) shows the coefficients c@xmath34 , c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 extracted from the hall bar and corbino disk data over the whole range up to the curie temperature ( 80k ) . note that the uniaxial crystalline term , c@xmath35 , becomes the dominant term for t@xmath3730k .",
    "this correlates with the uniaxial component of the magnetic anisotropy which dominates for t@xmath3730k as observed by squid magnetometry measurements ( figure 3(b ) ) .",
    "our work shows that in ( ga , mn)as ferromagnets , the symmetry breaking mechanism behind this previously reported @xcite uniaxial magneto - crystalline anisotropy in the magnetization also contributes to the amr .",
    "in our previous work @xcite we used the techniques explained above to extract the individual amr components for ultra thin ( 5 nm ) ga@xmath2mn@xmath3as films for which the amr ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) is very different from that observed in the 25 nm film . for the 5 nm film , the uniaxial crystalline term dominates the amr as shown in the fig .",
    "4(b ) for the device in the corbino geometry .",
    "these techniques were also used to demonstrate how the crystalline terms can be tuned by the use of lithographic patterning to induce an additional uniaxial anisotropy in very narrow hall bars .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the fabrication of narrow bars allows the in - plane compressive strain in the ( ga , mn)as film to relax in the direction along the width of the hall bar and this can lead to an additional uniaxial component in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy for bars with widths on the order of 1@xmath4 m or smaller .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) show the amr of 45@xmath4 m wide bars and 1@xmath4 m wide bars fabricated from nominally identical 25 nm ga@xmath2mn@xmath3as wafers .",
    "for the 45@xmath4 m bars , the cubic crystalline symmetry leads to the amr along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] being larger than along [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath380 ] . for the narrow bars we observe the opposite relationship , consistent with the addition of an extra uniaxial component which adds 0.8% to the amr when current is along [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath380 ] and subtracts 0.4% when the current is along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] .",
    "it is anticipated that the experimental techniques developed here will be useful in studying the magnetotransport coefficients in other magnetic materials and nanostructures .",
    "a six - band @xmath39 description of the gaas host valence band combined with the kinetic - exchange model of the coupling to the local mn@xmath40 @xmath41-moments @xcite can provide input for the boltzmann equation producing the conductivity tensor @xmath42 . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we expanded the studies of jungwirth  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite by performing numerical calculations of the @xmath43 for arbitrary in - plane directions of @xmath44 ( not just @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the results of the calculations ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) are in semi - quantitative agreement with the experimental amrs for the 25 nm ga@xmath2mn@xmath3as films shown in fig .",
    "[ 1 ]  ( a , b ) .",
    "the zero - temperature model of a @xmath47 compensated material @xcite shows that both the @xmath48 and @xmath49 are dominated by the non - crystalline @xmath50 and @xmath51 part , being of the order of several percent and negative ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the crystalline terms are an order of magnitude smaller ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) . these calculations assumed a growth strain @xmath56 and a uniaxial strain @xcite @xmath57 .",
    "previously , we noted that the crystalline terms arise from the warping of the valence band @xcite . in the rest of this paper",
    "we concentrate only on the non - crystalline component of the amr ( @xmath23 ) which in our model originates from anisotropic scattering of spin - orbit coupled holes on mn@xmath58 impurities containing polarized local moments .",
    "the six - band kohn - luttinger hamiltonian @xmath59 is parameterized by the luttinger parameters @xmath60 and so splitting @xmath61 while the exchange splitting strength is characterized by the constant @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian then reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the mn and hole spins placed at @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the mean - field treatment of the exchange splitting ( second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq-01 ] ) ) leads to a term formally equivalent to an effective zeeman splitting of strength @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mn concentration and @xmath70 for the five mn @xmath1-electrons . in the following we consider the spherical approximation to @xmath59 ( @xmath71 ) and the four - band model ( @xmath72 )",
    "the total hamiltonian can be then rewritten as @xmath73 explicit expressions of the matrices for the total angular momentum @xmath74 and hole spin @xmath75 can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite . with this simplified band structure",
    "we will now estimate the amr assuming that the scattering takes place only on mn ions substituting ga which is the dominant mechanism .",
    "numerically , the light hole bands are found to give only small contribution to the total conductivity as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig-01 ] ) , hence we consider only the heavy hole bands .",
    "this is a substantial simplification since the hamiltonian ( [ eq-02 ] ) restricted to the heavy - hole subspace @xmath76 can be diagonalized analytically ( see appendix a ) . by denoting the angle between @xmath77 and @xmath44 as @xmath78 the eigenenergies read @xmath79 in the presence of the exchange field @xmath80 the two originally identical heavy - hole fermi spheres transform into ( typically weakly ) distorted @xmath81 and @xmath82 spheres displaced by @xmath83 along @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath84 , @xmath85 are independent of @xmath80 and correspond to perfectly isotropic radial spin textures : expectation value of @xmath75 in the state @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) is a vector of length @xmath86 parallel to @xmath77 and pointing outwards ( inwards ) , fig .",
    "[ fig-02 ] .",
    "we remark that eq .",

    "thus , the fermi surfaces of @xmath59 in the @xmath90 sections comprise of , largest to smallest , two coincident circles for heavy holes with @xmath91 , which is independent of @xmath61 , two coincident circles for light holes and two coincident circles for split - off bands .",
