    "consider the problem of estimating the function @xmath1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb r$ ] from a univariate regression model @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where the @xmath4 are pre - specified design points and the @xmath5 are iid normal random variables with mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 .",
    "this paper presents a local asymptotic theory of penalized spline estimators of @xmath8 .",
    "the penalized spline regression model with difference penalty was introduced by eilers and marx ( 1996 ) , who coined the term `` @xmath0-splines '' , but using less knots for the regression problem can be traced back at least to osullivan ( 1986 ) .",
    "penalized spline smoothing has become popular over the last decade and the uses of low rank bases lead to highly tractable computation . the methodology and applications of @xmath0-splines are discussed extensively in ruppert , wand and carroll ( 2003 ) . on the other hand , asymptotic properties of the @xmath0-spline estimators",
    "are less explored in the literature .",
    "a few exceptions include recent papers such as hall and opsomer ( 2005 ) , li and ruppert ( 2008 ) , and claeskens , krivobokova , and opsomer ( 2009 ) .",
    "hall and opsomer ( 2005 ) placed knots continuously over a design set and established consistency of the estimator .",
    "li and ruppert ( 2008 ) developed an asymptotic theory of @xmath0-splines for piecewise constant and linear b - splines with the first and second order difference penalties .",
    "claeskens , krivobokova , and opsomer ( 2009 ) studied bias , variance and asymptotic rates of the @xmath0-spline estimator under different choices of the number of knots and penalty parameters .",
    "an interested reader may also refer to pal and woodroofe ( 2007 ) , shen and wang ( 2009 ) , and wang and shen ( 2009 ) for shape constrained regression estimators and their applications .",
    "the @xmath0-spline model approximates the regression function by @xmath9}(x ) = \\sum_{k=1}^{k_n+p } b_k b^{[p]}_k(x)$ ] , where @xmath10}_k : k = 1 , \\ldots , k_n + p \\ , \\big\\}$ ] is the @xmath11th degree b - spline basis with knots @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 will depend upon @xmath14 as discussed below .",
    "the spline coefficients @xmath15 subject to the @xmath16th - order difference penalty are chosen to minimize @xmath17}(t_i)\\big]^2 + \\lambda^ * \\sum_{k = m+1}^{k_n+p}\\big[\\delta^m ( b_k)\\big]^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the backward difference operator , i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for simplicity , we assume that both the design points and the knots are equally spaced on the interval @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "we also assume that @xmath23 is an integer denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "hence every @xmath24th design point is a knot , that is , @xmath25 for @xmath26 ; a more general case is discussed briefly in section [ sec : diss ] .",
    "the @xmath0-spline estimator is given by @xmath27}(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^{k_n+p } \\hat{b}_k b^{[p]}_k(x)$ ] .",
    "this paper develops a general asymptotic theory of @xmath0-splines under an arbitrary choice of @xmath28 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath0-spline estimator can be approximated by the solution of an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "this estimator is then shown to be described by a kernel estimator , using a green s function obtained from a closely related boundary value problem as a kernel .",
    "the asymptotic properties of the estimator thus are explicitly established based on the green s function and the solution of the differential equation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that asymptotic analysis of smoothing splines using green s functions was performed by rice and rosenblatt ( 1983 ) , silverman ( 1984 ) , messer ( 1991 ) , nychka ( 1995 ) and pal and woodroofe ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , these papers only treat limited special cases .",
    "in contrast , the current paper develops a general framework for @xmath0-splines .",
    "this framework leads to a relatively simpler approach to obtain a closed - form expression of an equivalent kernel for both inner points and boundary points at the first time .",
    "further , we show that the convergence rate of @xmath29}$ ] depends only on @xmath16 but not on @xmath28 , as long as @xmath13 tends to infinity fast enough ; see corollary [ coro : asy ] where @xmath13 is of order @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the contributions of the present paper are twofold : ( i ) the paper develops a general approach for asymptotic analysis of a @xmath0-spline estimator with an arbitrary spline degree and arbitrary order difference penalty via green s functions . to handle a general @xmath0-spline estimator , various techniques for linear odes",
    "are exploited to obtain a corresponding green s function .",
    "( ii ) the closed - form expressions of equivalent kernels for both inner and boundary points are established and convergence rates are developed for general @xmath0-spline estimators . compared with the existing results based on matrix techniques , e.g. li and ruppert ( 2008 ) and claeskens , krivobokova , and opsomer ( 2009 ) , the use of green s functions considerably simplifies the development and yields an instrumental alternative to establish the equivalent kernels for general @xmath0-splines .",
    "moreover , this also leads to the convergence rates and the observation that the rates are independent of the splines degrees and the number of knots for an arbitrary @xmath0-spline estimator . while this observation is pointed out by li and ruppert ( 2008 ) for piecewise constant and piecewise linear splines and",
    "is conjectured for general @xmath0-splines , no rigorous justification has been given for general @xmath0-splines in the literature ; the current paper offers a satisfactory answer to this issue in a general setting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : charact_estimator ] characterizes the general @xmath0-spline estimator as an approximate solution of a linear differential equation subject to suitable boundary conditions .",
    "section  [ sec : gr ] investigates the solution of such the differential equation and obtains the related green s functions as equivalent kernels for a @xmath0-spline estimator of an arbitrary b - spline degree with any order difference penalty . using these green s functions , the asymptotic properties of @xmath0-splines",
    "are established in section  [ sec : asy ] .",
    "section  [ sec : boundary ] addresses kernel approximation near the boundary of the design set . by formulating boundary conditions as an appropriate integral form",
    ", an explicit equivalent kernel is obtained .",
    "finally , extensions to unequally spaced data and multivariate @xmath0-splines are discussed in section  [ sec : diss ] .",
