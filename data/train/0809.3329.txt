    "the ising model with random ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings is a simplified model@xcite for disordered uniaxial magnetic materials which show glassy behavior in some region of their phase diagram , such as fe@xmath19mn@xmath20tio@xmath21 and eu@xmath19ba@xmath20mno@xmath21 ; see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "the random nature of the short - ranged interactions is mimicked by nearest - neighbor random bonds .",
    "this model is also interesting _",
    "per se _ , since it provides a laboratory in which the combined effect of quenched disorder and frustration can be studied .",
    "it is now well established that three - dimensional ising spin - glass models present a high - temperature paramagnetic phase and , for some values of the parameters , a low - temperature glassy phase ( if the frustration is small , the low - temperature phase is ferromagnetic ) .",
    "the two phases are separated by a continuous phase transition , which is expected to have universal features , i.e. to belong to a universality class which is independent of the details of the model and , in particular , of the disorder distribution .",
    "several numerical works have addressed these issues , considering various ising spin - glass models , characterized by different disorder distributions , with or without dilution . over the years",
    "many estimates of the critical exponents have been obtained .",
    "we mention the most recent ones for the correlation - length exponent @xmath15 : @xmath22,@xcite @xmath23,@xcite @xmath24,@xcite @xmath25,@xcite @xmath26,@xcite @xmath27,@xcite obtained from simulations of the symmetric model with bimodal distribution ; @xmath28 for the bond - diluted symmetric bimodal model with @xmath29;@xcite @xmath30@xcite and @xmath31  @xcite for the symmetric model with gaussian disorder distribution ; @xmath32 for the random - anisotropy heisenberg model in the limit of large anisotropy,@xcite which is expected to be in the same ising spin - glass universality class.@xcite moreover , the analysis of different quantities has often given different estimates of the same critical exponent , even in the same model .",
    "for instance , recent monte carlo ( mc ) studies @xcite find significant discrepancies among the estimates of the exponent @xmath15 obtained from the finite - size scaling ( fss ) at @xmath33 of the temperature derivative of @xmath34 , of the binder cumulant , and of the overlap susceptibility .",
    "for the bimodal ising model ref .",
    "quotes @xmath22 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , from the analysis of these three quantities , respectively .",
    "a likely reason for these discrepancies is the presence of scaling corrections , which may be quite important in spin - glass systems since the absence of fast mc algorithms makes it necessary to work with systems of relatively small size .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is a detailed analysis of the role of scaling corrections in spin - glass systems .",
    "we present a general renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis based on the wegner expansion,@xcite which allows us to predict the corrections to the asymptotic critical behavior for the different quantities .",
    "in particular , we show that the analytic dependence of the relevant scaling fields on the model parameters , such as the temperature , may give rise to scaling corrections that decay as powers of @xmath37 , where @xmath0 is the linear size of the lattice .",
    "since @xmath38 in ising spin - glass systems , they decay quite slowly and may give rise to systematic deviations which are difficult to detect , given the small interval of values of @xmath0 which can be considered in mc simulations .",
    "their presence explains some inconsistencies in the standard analyses of mc data reported in the literature .",
    "thus , it is crucial to take scaling corrections into account for an accurate study of the critical behavior , for a robust check of universality among different models , and for reliable estimates of universal quantities such as the critical exponents .    in this paper",
    "we report a high - statistics mc study of different ising spin - glass models .",
    "we consider the @xmath1 ising model for two values of the disorder parameter , the bond - diluted symmetric bimodal model with various values of the dilution , and also the model with gaussian disorder distribution .",
    "we determine the fss behavior of several rg invariant quantities , such as the ratio @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the second - moment correlation length ) and the quartic cumulants defined from the overlap variables .",
    "we verify with good precision their independence on the model and disorder distribution , providing an accurate evidence of universality .",
    "then , we obtain an estimate of the leading correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath9 : @xmath10 . finally , we determine the critical exponents . we analyze the mc data at the critical point and in the high - temperature phase , taking into account the rg predictions for the scaling corrections and the precise above - reported estimate of @xmath9 .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 then , using scaling and hyperscaling relations we obtain @xmath42 in this work we extend the results presented in ref .  .",
    "first , we have significantly increased the statistics of the large-@xmath0 data for the bimodal symmetric ising model and we have added some data for other diluted models and for the bimodal model with gaussian distributed couplings .",
    "second , we present a much more detailed analysis of the critical - point data and a new analysis of the high - temperature data obtained in the parallel - tempering simulations .",
    "this allows us to check the universality of the critical behavior of the correlation length and of the susceptibility in the high - temperature phase .",
    "finally , we discuss the extended - scaling scheme , @xcite which is inspired by the high - temperature expansion . as already noted in ref .  , this scheme shows an apparent improvement of the scaling behavior with respect to the naive approach in which scaling corrections are simply neglected , at least for some quantities , e.g. , the overlap susceptibility .",
    "however , as we shall show , such an improvement is only marginal for the purpose of obtaining accurate results .",
    "indeed , this requires to take into account the analytic and nonanalytic scaling corrections predicted by the rg theory .",
