    "the overall probability of finding a pair of electrons in the same and opposite sublattices are @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively . from these results",
    "we conclude that in the two - electron system , electrons prefer to stay in opposite sublattices where they can move almost independently of each other .",
    "obviously this results from the fact that intra - sublattice hopping terms @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath83 do not frustrate the spin background and therefore allow electrons to move more freely .",

    "the proximity of these values to the root - mean - square separation between two uncorrelated electrons , 2.3827 , again suggests that electrons in our systems are almost uncorrelated .",
    "next we go to the momentum space and study the momentum distribution function of spin objects @xmath86 .",
    "one motivation for studying @xmath87 is to learn about the fermi surface of the model . for this purpose",

    "a second motivation for studying the momentum distribution function is to see whether the single - carrier ground state is relevant to the physics of the multiply - doped system .",
    "this has been a subject of discussion in the @xmath0-@xmath3 model.@xcite note that in the electron - doped model some authors choose to report the momentum distribution function of charge carriers , @xmath88 , instead of @xmath87 .",
    "these distribution functions have the following properties : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of spin objects with spin @xmath91 . in this section",

    "we will then discuss momentum distribution functions of the two- and four - electron systems .",
    "we will show that they can be constructed from the single - carrier result and that the fermi surfaces are consistent with small pockets at single - carrier ground state momenta .",

    "this is obviously due to the opposite signs of @xmath0 in the two models .",
    "this dome - shape feature therefore does not represent the shape of the true fermi surface .",

    "( [ bound ] ) , @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , sharp minima found in fig .",
    "[ fig : nq1e ] are also found in the momentum distribution functions of the @xmath0-@xmath3 model with one hole . just like in the @xmath0-@xmath3 model , a `` dip '' in @xmath95",
    "is found at the ground state momentum [ @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nq1e](b ) ] , and an `` antidips '' in @xmath98 is found at a * k * point which is displaced from the dip by the antiferromagnetic momentum @xmath50 [ @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nq1e](a ) ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : nq1e](b ) we find that the depth of the dip @xmath99 is 0.334 .",
    "this is very close to @xmath100 which is 0.318 , indicating its close tie with the fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 along the edge of the afbz are very small .",
    "therefore our data is consistent with a small fermi surface , or carrier pocket , at @xmath13 .",
    "this is to be expected in a lightly doped antiferromagnet.@xcite note that all features described so far are qualitatively the same in the hole- and electron - doped models .",
    "they are generic features resulting from the kinematic effect and the antiferromagnetic order of the spin background .",
    "they do not reflect the different physics of the hole- and electron - doped models .",
    "when there is an even number of spin objects , @xmath101 and we drop the spin variable @xmath91 from @xmath102 .",
    "[ fig : e_nq ] shows @xmath103 in systems doped with two and four electrons .",
    "again we can identity the same `` dome - shape '' structure found in the one - electron system .",
    "it is a generic feature of the model and does not reflect the physics of the charge carriers .",
    "further evidence for this comes from the `` height '' of the dome , which is defined as @xmath104 . in the two - electron system",
    "it is 0.114 , which is roughly the same as @xmath105 in the one - electron system . and",
    "in the four - electron system it is 0.225 , roughly twice of that in the two - electron system .",
    "these agreements show that the dome - shaped structures at different doping levels are due to the same effect .",
    "another feature common to the one- , two- and four - electron systems is that their @xmath106 have very prominent dips at @xmath107 and @xmath14 .",
    "these dips resemble electron pockets .",
    "this is certainly not a generic feature of @xmath0-@xmath3-like models because it is not found in the @xmath0-@xmath3 model.@xcite note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are along the afbz boundary where @xmath106 is not disguised by the generic dome - shape feature .",
    "therefore these pocket - like features should reflect the physics of the systems .",
    "the fact that pocket - like features are found at these doping levels immediately suggests the relevance of the singly - doped state to the multiply - doped one .",
    "if electrons doped into the parent system behave like weakly interacting fermions , then it is reasonable to expect that multiple - electron systems can be approximated by filling up the single - electron band .",
    "this should lead to electron - pockets at single - electron ground state momenta . to make this argument quantitative , we consider the charge - carrier distribution function @xmath108 . from eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , @xmath108 can be considered as the suppression of @xmath109 from its maximum value upon doping .",
    "if multiple - electron states can be built up from single - electron states , we expect the suppressions in @xmath110 due to individual electrons doped into the system to be additive , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the distribution function of a system with @xmath36 electrons .",
    "table  [ tab : nq ] shows that in the two - electron system the additive approximation is satisfied at all available * k * points . in the four - electron system it works satisfactorily at most * k * points .",

    "therefore our results show that the additive approximation works in the electron - doped model at doping levels up to at least 0.125 .",

    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : additive ] ) we have to average the one - carrier results over all degenerate ground states . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "our previous discussions have been based on the scenario that antiferromagnetic spin order is preserved upon doping .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 hopping terms do not frustrate the spin background . in this section",
    "we provide evidence for the existence of antiferromagnetic correlation .",
    "antiferromagnetic spin order can be measured directly using the spin correlation function @xmath115 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss_sq](a ) . at half - filling the system",
    "is known to possess long - range antiferromagnetic order@xcite and its spin correlation is shown as a reference .",
    "we note that in the two - electron system the spin correlation is not much weaker than that at half - filling , and more importantly it does not show significant decay beyond @xmath116 .",
    "this indicates that strong antiferromagnetic spin order exists in the system .",
    "the same qualitative trend is also observed in the four - electron system .",
    "although the spin correlation is inevitably weakened due to higher doping level , it does not decay significantly beyond @xmath116 .",
    "another way to display the same data is through the static structure factor , @xmath117 fig .",
    "[ fig : ss_sq](b ) shows the structure factors in systems doped with two and four electrons . as the doping level increases , the height of the antiferromagnetic peak at @xmath50 is reduced .",
    "but it still remains prominent and there is no sign of enhancement at any other * k * point . our results therefore indicate that antiferromagnetic order persists at least up to @xmath4 . note that this doping level is close to the point where the antiferromagnetic phase ends in the phase diagram of ndcecuo,@xcite which is @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of a staggered pattern in the charge current correlation function has been established in the @xmath0-@xmath3 model.@xcite it has been interpreted as a direct evidence for the staggered - flux phase in the mean - field picture.@xcite in this picture the hopping motions of charge carriers frustrate the antiferromagnetic spin background and lead to staggered chiral spin correlation . binding of charge carriers is mediated through the attraction between charge carriers with opposite vorticity .",
    "numerically it has been found that staggered current pattern exists in the two - hole @xmath0-@xmath3 model with @xmath39 symmetry only when the holes are loosely bound . it does not exist in states with other symmetry , nor when @xmath118 is so large that the holes are tightly bound .",
    "the vorticity and charge correlations are found to be proportional to each other .",
    "however , in the electron - doped model a very basic ingredient of the above picture is missing , namely , the hopping motions of charge carriers are mostly unfrustrating .",
    "the result is that antiferromagnetic order is robust and charge carriers do not have significant correlation .",
    "consequently it is very unlikely that staggered current correlation can exist .",
    "however , as antiferromagnetic spin order is weakened at higher doping level , more subtle correlations may emerge.@xcite we therefore calculate the current correlation in the two- and four - carrier ground states and see if there exists a systematic trend as doping level increases .    fig .",
    "[ fig : e - jj ] shows the spatial variation of the current correlation function @xmath119 , where @xmath120 for systems doped with two and four electrons .",

    "the vorticity correlation @xmath122 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : vorticity ] .",
    "our result for the two - electron system leaves little doubt that there is no staggered pattern in either @xmath123 or @xmath124 . in the four - electron system",
    "there is again no clear indication of a staggered pattern .",
    "we therefore conclude that intra - sublattice hopping terms in the electron - doped model do not favor the formation of a staggered pattern in the current correlation .",
    "this agrees with a recent mean - field study on the electron - doped model.@xcite furthermore , in the mean - field picture the loss of vorticity correlation implies that charge carrier binding is not favored , which agrees with our results in section [ sec : cr ] .",
    "finally we remark that in our four - electron system , it seems like at short distances the current correlation is stronger and exhibit a staggered pattern .",
    "this is most obvious when we compare fig .",
    "[ fig : vorticity](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that at doping level @xmath4 the system may be starting to develop some other order due to the weakening of antiferromagnetic correlation .",
    "however , the range within which we observe the `` right '' correlation is too short and the correlation is too weak for us to decide whether it has any significance .",
    "therefore we are not able to make any definite statement concerning this matter .",
    "we have solved the electron - doped model with one , two , and four charge carriers on a 32-site square lattice .",
    "our results cover doping levels up to @xmath4 . in the electron - doped model , intra - sublattice hoppings of charge carriers do not frustrate the spin background .",
    "most of our results presented above can be understood as consequences of this fact . since hopping motions are mostly unfrustrating",
    ", charge carriers can propagate more freely .",
    "this is reflected in the large quasi - particle bandwidth in the singly - doped system . in systems doped with two and four electrons",
    ", the charge carrier correlation function shows that electrons are uncorrelated .",
    "again this is due to the fact that electrons can hop more freely in the same sublattice .",
    "there is no evidence of charge carriers forming a bound state .",
    "unfrustrating hopping motions also mean that antiferromagnetic correlation in the spin background is better preserved upon doping .",
    "this is clearly shown in the spin correlation function and static structure factor .",

    "this resembles a fermi surface consisting of small pockets at single - carrier ground state momenta , which is expected in a lightly doped antiferromagnet.@xcite these small pockets persist in our systems doped with two and four electrons and are clearly visible in their momentum distribution functions of spin objects .",
    "furthermore , momentum distribution functions of our multiply - doped systems can be well approximated by adding up the singly - doped momentum distribution functions .",

    "our results show that antiferromagnetic order in electron - doped model persists at least up to doping level @xmath4 .",
    "we find no clear evidence of other orders existing in our systems .",
    "this is consistent with the phase diagram of @xmath8 whose antiferromagnetic phase persists up to @xmath9.@xcite arpes experiment on the same material shows that before the fermi surface becomes a large one centered at @xmath50 , small pockets will start to appear at @xmath51 ( and its equivalent points ) as those at @xmath13 evolve.@xcite however , the quasi - particle energy @xmath125 at @xmath126 in the electron - doped model is quite high ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dispersion ] ) . assuming that the quasi - particle dispersion relation does not change much on further doping , electrons doped into the system will fill lower energy states at other * k * points first . therefore it is not surprising that we do not see pockets developing at @xmath51 .",
    "a recent theoretical calculation predicts that pockets will start to appear at @xmath51 at @xmath127 when the fermi level crosses a different band from that at lower doping levels.@xcite therefore it is possible that our doping level is not large enough to observe the change in the fermi surface as revealed by arpes experiment .",
