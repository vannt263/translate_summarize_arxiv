    "at the lhc a new energy frontier is reached , which allows for new searches of unknown particles and further tests of the standard model . from the theory side",
    "this also requires very precise predictions of cross sections and distributions , exceeding the precision of a leading - order approximation .",
    "we present a calculation of production including qcd corrections and the leptonic decays of the @xmath1- and the @xmath2-boson with off - shell effects , @xmath6 this process with leptons , photons and missing energy in the final state provides a background to new physics searches ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also , this process offers the possibility to study the quartic vector - boson couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see right diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) @xcite and test the standard model .",
    "it is one of the missing pieces for a full knowledge of triple vector boson production at next - to leading order ( nlo ) qcd .",
    "there has been a strong effort for the calculation of these processes .",
    "the processes with only massive vector bosons in the final state have been completely calculated @xcite .",
    "rather recently , also the nlo qcd calculation of the processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been completed @xcite and first results of the nlo qcd computation of the process @xmath11 have been presented @xcite .",
    "vector - boson pair production accompanied with one jet has also been studied including qcd corrections for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we calculate all contributions to the processes ( [ processes ] ) up to order @xmath16 in the limit where all fermions are massless . at leading order",
    ", 71 distinct diagrams appear , which we group as three different topologies , according to the number of vector bosons attached to the quark line .",

    "hereby , we use the procedure of _ leptonic tensors _ , as first described in ref .",
    "this greatly reduces the computation time needed . for the computation of the matrix elements",
    ", we use the helicity method introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by charge conservation , a @xmath1 boson must always couple to the quark line .",
    "hence , we only need to compute the left - handed chirality part .    at nlo qcd",
    ", virtual and real emission diagrams contribute to the cross section .",
    "both contain infrared divergences , which must cancel in the sum according to the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem  @xcite .",
    "to handle this cancellation in a numerically stable way , we use the catani - seymour dipole subtraction method @xcite .",
    "initial - state collinear singularities are partly factorized into the parton - distribution functions .",
    "this leads to additional so - called `` finite collinear terms '' .",
    "the nlo real corrections are given by diagrams where an additional gluon is attached to the quark line which is possible in two different ways .",
    "either this gluon is a final - state particle and considered as radiated off the quark line , or an initial - state gluon which splits into a @xmath17 pair and we have an emission of a quark .",
    "with 194 different feynman diagrams , the use of leptonic tensors proves to be an advantage in this case .",
    "the presence of isolated on - shell photons requires extra care in the case of real emissions .",
    "an additional singularity arises from photon emission collinear to a massless quark . requiring a simple separation cut between photon and jet",
    "is not allowed , since the cancellation of the gluonic infrared divergences between virtual and real emission processes would be spoiled .",
    "the phase space for soft - gluon emission would be reduced while leaving untouched the virtual counterpart , leading to the non - cancellation . in principle , this problem can be solved by adding processes with quark fragmentation to photons . here , we use a simpler approach by requiring a specially crafted cut first suggested in ref .",
    "we will discuss the details of this cut in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "virtual nlo qcd corrections arise from the insertion of gluon lines into the topologies of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] in every possible way .",
    "therefore , the left topology gives rise to loops with up to five external particles , _",
    "i.e. _  pentagon diagrams . for the middle and right ones at most box and triangle diagrams ,",
    "respectively , appear . up to the box level , we compute the loop integrals using passarino - veltman reduction  @xcite ; additionally we avoid the explicit calculation of the inverse of the gram matrix . instead",
    ", we solve a system of linear equations , which is numerically more stable close to the singular points .",
    "for the pentagon contributions , we apply the method of ref .",
    "this circumvents the appearance of small gram determinants in planar configurations of the external momenta altogether .",
    "the complete virtual corrections @xmath18 \\ m_b , \\label{eq : mv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be separated into a part which is proportional to the born matrix element , @xmath19 , and a remainder , @xmath20 . here",
    ", @xmath21 denotes the partonic center - of - mass energy , which corresponds to the invariant mass of the @xmath22 final state . for diagrams with only a single @xmath1 attached to the quark line , @xmath20 vanishes , _",
    "i.e. _  the virtual corrections completely factorize to the born amplitude .",
    "for this factorization formula to hold , the transversality property of the photon @xmath23 must be used  @xcite .",
    "then we can reuse the general results for the finite remainder already obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , adapting the attached vector bosons to our case .",
    "another optimization can be performed by shifting parts from the pentagon diagrams into box contributions  @xcite . to do this",
    ", we split the polarization vector of the vector bosons into a part proportional to the four - momentum of the boson @xmath24 and a remainder @xmath25 , which is chosen such that @xmath26 this part leads to a reduction in the size of the pentagon contributions , which we can therefore compute with lower statistics . contracting the pentagons with @xmath27 ,",
    "they can be expressed as a difference of two box diagrams which are numerically faster to compute .",
    "hence , we can gain speed while keeping the total error the same .",
    "this shift also serves as a consistency check between the box and pentagon routines , as the total result must stay unchanged .    to verify the correctness of our calculation",
    ", we have performed several checks .",
    "first , we have compared all tree - level amplitudes against matrix elements generated by madgraph@xcite and find an agreement of at least 14 digits , which is at the level of the machine precision .",
    "additionally , we have also compared the integrated cross section for both @xmath28 and @xmath29 against ` madevent ` and ` sherpa `  @xcite .",
    "we find an agreement at the per mill level , which is compatible with the integration error .",
    "furthermore , we have checked the implementation of the catani - seymour subtraction scheme .",
    "we have verified that for the real emission part the ratio between the differential real - emission cross section and the dipole approaches @xmath30 once we go to the soft or collinear limit .",
    "also , we have checked that finite contributions left after the cancellation of the infrared divergence can be shifted between the virtual and real parts without affecting the total result .    for the phase space implementation ,",
    "the @xmath31 phase space was split into three different parts .",
    "they correspond to three topologies which we have identified to give the largest contributions , which are of comparable size each .",
    "the first one corresponds to a @xmath32 s - channel structure , where possibly a massless particle ( the final - state jet for the real - emission contribution ) is radiated off first .",
    "the two outgoing particles are the massless photon and a pseudo - particle with a mass of 450 gev and a width of 100 gev .",
    "the latter one then decays into the two massive vector bosons , which in turn decay into their respective fermion ",
    "anti - fermion pair , all via @xmath33 topologies .",
    "for all invariant masses of intermediate particles we apply a breit - wigner mapping to the corresponding random number , so that the peak is flattened out , integrating over the whole available energy range .",
    "the second and third structure correspond to @xmath32 s - channel production of the two massive vector bosons , where one undergoes a two - body decay into its fermions and the other one , via a @xmath34 process , into the fermions and the photon . to avoid double - counting we compute for both fermion  anti - fermion pairs the difference of the invariant mass of the photon and the fermion ",
    "anti - fermion pair and the mass of the corresponding vector boson . if both differences are larger than 30 gev , the phase - space point is assigned to the first topology , otherwise to that one where the difference is smaller .",
    "we perform the numerical evaluation of our calculation with an nlo monte carlo program based on the structure of the  program package  @xcite . as input parameters in the electroweak sector",
    "we take the @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson masses and the fermi constant . the weak mixing angle and the electromagnetic coupling constant",
    "are computed from these using tree - level relations : @xmath35    top - quark effects are not considered and all other quarks are taken massless .",
    "effects from generation mixing are neglected , as we set the ckm matrix to the identity matrix .",
    "as the central value for factorization and renormalization scales we choose the invariant mass of the leptons and the photon @xmath36 for the parton distribution functions , we choose cteq6l1 at lo and the cteq6 m set with @xmath37 at nlo  @xcite .",
    "we impose the following set of minimal cuts on the rapidity @xmath38 and the transverse momentum , @xmath39 , of the final - state photon and charged leptons @xmath40 these take into account typical requirements of the experimental detectors .",
    "furthermore , leptons , photon and jet need to be well separated in order to avoid divergences from collinear photons and to be able to identify them as separate objects in the detectors .",
    "therefore , we impose @xmath41 here , a jet refers to a final - state quark or gluon in the nlo real emission contribution with @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 .",
