    "the dynamics of charge carriers in low - dimensional quantum structures has been in the focus of interest for many years . a special role in its study",
    "is played by probeless methods allowing the influence of contacts to be avoided .    in one of these methods",
    "the attenuation and the phase shift of a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) are measured .",
    "these are caused by charge carriers in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer located close to the surface supporting the saw .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the first results of acoustic studies of 2d electron systems were reported in ref .  .",
    "in that paper , the interaction of a saw with the 2d electrons in a gaas / algaas heterostructure was investigated in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) regime . in this work",
    ", a saw was excited and propagated directly on the surface of a piezoelectric gaas / algaas sample .",
    "this procedure caused the sample to be somewhat mechanically stressed and thereby deformed .",
    "later the authors suggested a configuration in which no mechanical deformation is transferred from the piezoelectric substrate to the sample , such that only the electrical field matters .",
    "@xcite this allowed to determine the complex ac conductance , @xmath1 , from the measured saw attenuation and phase shift . a relevant theoretical model developed in refs .   allowed extracting quantitative information , as was shown in subsequent works",
    "@xcite however , the acoustic method has an upper frequency limit , associated with technological problems in producing the inter - digital transducers ( idts ) used for the excitation and detection of the saw , see sec .",

    ", measurements of the electron response in low - dimensional systems to high - frequency perturbations are especially important , as being related to several intrinsic properties of low - dimensional systems . among these properties are peculiarities of electron localization , collective modes and their pinning , mechanisms of integer and fractional quantum hall effects , etc . a powerful approach is provided by microwave spectroscopy ( mws ) suggested in ref .  .",
    "various modifications of this method , including probeless ones , were developed in refs .  .",
    "the mws provides a much broader frequency domain compared with acoustic spectroscopy  ( as ) - from hundreds of megahertz to dozens of gigahertz .",
    "it is very efficient for studying the dependence of the electron response on magnetic field , temperature , etc .",
    "however , it is rather difficult to calibrate the measured ac conductance in absolute units , which is why the results of many papers on this subject are presented in relative units .",
    "the aim of the present work is to compare the results of microwave measurements of @xmath2 with those obtained using as , as well as dc transport measurements .",
    "this comparison will facilitate the calibration of the dynamical electromagnetic response of the low - dimensional electron gas in absolute units .",

    "a saw is excited on the surface of a piezoelectric linbo@xmath8 crystal by electromagnetic pulses applied to an interdigital transducer idt1 and detected by another interdigital transducer idt2 placed on the same surface .",
    "the saw , generated by the piezoelectric effect in linbo@xmath8 , is accompanied by a travelling electromagnetic wave .",
    "the sample is pressed onto the surface by a spring . as a result",
    ", the electric field of the travelling wave penetrates into the 2d hole gas and interacts with holes .",
    "this interaction leads to an attenuation , @xmath9 , and a phase shift of the saw , both of which are measured .",
    "the latter manifests itself as a renormalization of the saw phase velocity , @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to note that both real and imaginary parts of the conductance vanish in a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this creates the possibility to single out the electron contribution by subtracting the zero - field values of @xmath9 and @xmath11 from those in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the expressions for these differences , as well as the parameters which we use for finding the conductances , are given in appendix  [ a ] as eqs .   and .",

    "the microwave pulses applied to the cpw center conductor excite a quasi - transverse electromagnetic mode ( quasi - tem mode ) .",
    "similarly to the case of a saw , the interaction with holes in the 2d layer leads to the attenuation of this mode , as well as to a change of its phase .",

    "however , we know that at the maxima of the @xmath70 curves the conductance should coincide with the static one for any frequency , so they should be _ frequency - independent_. therefore , we suggest rescaling the curve by some factor , @xmath73 , such that the values of @xmath74 at the maxima will be equal to the static conductance , @xmath75 , for the same temperature . the results of low - frequency acoustic measurements do not need such rescaling since , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig8_new ] .",
    "and 6 at @xmath51  k. the solid horizontal line shows the dc conductance , which is practically the same for both minima .",
    "[ fig8_new ] ]    it is clear that at sufficiently high frequencies , @xmath82  mhz , the minimal values of @xmath49 are roughly proportional to @xmath83 , as it should be for ac hopping conductance .",
    "the solid line shows the value of the static conductance , @xmath84 . at very low frequencies ,",
    "the two - site model leading to @xmath85 dependence is not applicable , and more complicated clusters become important , see for a review refs .  .",
    "as a result , @xmath86",
    ". this might be the reason of the fact that the point corresponding to @xmath52  mhz falls above the line corresponding to the slope of 1 in the @xmath87 vs. @xmath88 dependence .",
    "we have developed a procedure for quantitative probeless measurements of the ac conductance of 2d electron / hole layers in a broad frequency domain .",
    "the main ingredient of this procedure is to measure the attenuation of surface acoustic waves ( at low frequencies ) and electromagnetic modes in the cpw ( at high frequencies ) in a transverse magnetic field in the regime of the iqhe .",
    "since the transverse magnetic field suppresses the electronic contribution to the conductance both in diffusive and hopping regimes , it is possible to resolve the contribution of the charge carriers .",
    "another important point is to rescale the data obtained by mws such that the maxima of @xmath74 for all frequencies coincide with the static conductance ( and with the results of low - frequency acoustic measurements ) .",
    "this rescaling to some extent compensates for the leakage of the electromagnetic modes outside the slots of the cpw .",
    "the results of acoustic measurements do not need such rescaling since the maxima of @xmath74 for all saw frequencies coincide with those of the static conductance .",
    "this fact allows avoiding dc measurements which would require contacts . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath74 extracted from mws for any frequency can be rescaled to make the maxima coinciding with those extracted from as . in this way",
    ", we can determine @xmath89 in a broad domain of frequencies and magnetic fields without the need of contacts .",
    "this is the main conclusion of this work .",
    "the suggested procedure has been tested using a well - characterized sample .",
    "it is shown that at frequencies close to 150  mhz , where both the as and mws can be performed , the dependences @xmath74 obtained by both spectroscopies practically coincide with each other .",
    "the advantage of the procedure is that it can be applied to various materials and structures . in particular , systems without intrinsic piezoelectric effect",
    "can be studied acoustically since the sample is mounted on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal .",
    "the procedure is especially useful for studies of the ac conductance in the hopping regime , which is the case in the minima of the iqhe .",
