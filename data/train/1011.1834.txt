    "more specifically , wobbling bands  @xcite , characteristic of triaxial deformation , have drawn much attention .",
    "the latter have been interpreted as structures built on the @xmath16 proton orbital .",
    "however , it remains puzzling that this excitation mode has only been confirmed experimentally thus far in the odd - mass lu isotopes  @xcite and in @xmath17ta  @xcite .",
    "in fact , evidence for wobbling in @xmath17ta was found as part of a systematic search for this phenomenon in ta nuclei ( having two more protons than lu )  @xcite .",
    "owing to the power of gammasphere , a considerable amount of data on @xmath0ta was also collected as a byproduct of this search .",
    "although these data do not provide evidence for wobbling in @xmath0ta , they enabled new insight in the high - spin structure of this nucleus about which little was known .    compared to even - even and odd - mass nuclei ,",
    "the properties of odd - odd systems are more challenging to study due to the complexity of level structures associated with contributions from both valence protons and neutrons .",
    "consequently , only limited information is usually available for odd - odd nuclei throughout the chart of nuclides , even though these systems can aid significantly in our understanding of the dependence of band crossing frequencies and aligned angular momenta on the occupation of specific orbitals .",
    "the light odd - odd ta nuclei are characterized by fairly small quadrupole deformations and provide a good opportunity to investigate this issue  @xcite . a recent high - spin study on @xmath18ta  @xcite by the present collaboration revealed 11 bands and allowed for a detailed investigation of these crossings .",
    "the data on @xmath0ta discussed here can be viewed as an extension of this work .",
    "thus far , only two bands with spins up to @xmath19 are known in @xmath0ta  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work was three - fold : first , to confirm the previously known states at low spin and verify their properties ( configuration , spin , and parity ) ; second , to expand the level scheme by searching for new levels and structures ; and third , to obtain a satisfactory interpretation of the experimental observations .",
    "high - spin states in @xmath0ta were populated with a 235-mev @xmath2v beam delivered by the atlas facility at argonne national laboratory .",
    "the beam bombarded a stacked target of two self - supporting @xmath1sn foils , each with a thickness of 500 @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 rays emitted in the reaction were collected by the gammasphere array  @xcite which consisted of 101 compton - suppressed ge detectors . approximately @xmath22 coincidence events with fold 4 and higher were accumulated during five days of beam time . although the 4n ( leading to @xmath17ta ) and 5n ( @xmath23ta ) reaction channels dominated , a useful amount of data on @xmath0ta ( @xmath24-channel ) were also acquired .",
    "the off - line data analysis was performed with the radware software package  @xcite .",
    "hence , cubes and hypercubes were generated to establish the @xmath21-ray coincidence relationships .",
    "the states at low spin in @xmath0ta were first observed by meissner @xmath25",
    "@xcite in the @xmath26 decay of @xmath0w . in subsequent work by theine @xmath25  @xcite , two coupled @xmath27 rotational bands with spins up to @xmath28 and @xmath29 were identified and configurations were proposed based upon the fact that ( i ) the yrast band in the odd-@xmath6 neighbor @xmath17ta ( also studied in ref .",

    "the concept of the additive coupling of quasiproton and quasineutron states in neighboring odd - mass nuclei  @xcite was employed to propose tentative spin and parity assignments to the bands observed in @xmath0ta  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in the previous high - spin work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the transitions belonging to @xmath0ta were unambiguously identified by combining the following criteria : ( i ) all strong transitions were found to be in coincidence with ta characteristic @xmath33 rays ; ( ii ) many of the strong transitions were also found to be in coincidence with @xmath34 evaporation residues identified in another experiment where a recoil mass separator was used  @xcite ; and , ( iii ) all transitions at high spin were in coincidence with known low - lying transitions . since the main purpose in the present work was to search for weakly populated states and bands at high spin , the expansion of level structures in @xmath0ta was based solely on coincidence relationships between newly observed @xmath21 rays and known transitions of ref .",

    "the placement of these complex transitions and the expansion of the level scheme were challenging as a result .",
    "however , due to the large resolving power and efficiency of gammasphere for high - multiplicity @xmath21-ray events , the triple - gating technique ( @xmath35 format ) could be used to delineate the band structures of interest , rather than the single - gating method ( @xmath36 format ) of ref .",

    "six different single - quasiproton structures were observed .",
    "the bands of @xmath51 and @xmath52 parentage were found to be decoupled ( only a single sequence was observed for each band ) , therefore they are unlikely to be involved in forming the bands in @xmath0ta .",

    "the @xmath117 orbital is positioned low in energy , and becomes yrast at @xmath149 .",
    "this results in the prediction that the @xmath141 and @xmath142 crossings should also occur at frequencies between 0.5 and 0.6 mev , similar to the @xmath143 one .",
    "if the @xmath150 or @xmath151 crossing or both were involved , the two signatures in band 1 in @xmath0ta would encounter the second alignment in a similar way , in contradiction with the experimental observations .",
    "the difficulty of the csm in reproducing proton crossings at high frequencies for nuclei in this region is well documented .",
    "such discrepancies may come , for example , from a change of deformation with increasing frequency and/or higher - order pairing terms , which are not contained in the csm  @xcite .    for band 2 in @xmath0ta , the existence of the @xmath152 ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) quasiproton in its configuration would not prevent the occurrence of the mixed @xmath144 ( or @xmath147 ) proton crossing in both signatures .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:168ta_band2_alignment ] , the @xmath144 alignment is delayed up to the highest frequency observed in the @xmath153 sequence ( @xmath154 ) and the @xmath155 signature ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath157 crossing occurs with a large interaction strength and results in a smooth gradual alignment for both signatures of band 2 , which would block the subsequent @xmath143 and @xmath151 crossings .    from the detailed discussion above ,",
    "it is clear that the understanding of the proton alignments involving @xmath158 and @xmath139 orbitals that occur in this mass region is far from complete and that further investigation is necessary .",
    "the two coupled bands previously observed in @xmath0ta have been extended significantly to higher spin , from @xmath19 to above @xmath159 .",
    "quasiparticle configurations were assigned to the bands based on the observed signature splittings , @xmath5 ratios , and rotation - induced alignments .",
    "a @xmath72 configuration has been assigned to band 1 , while band 2 is proposed to be associated with the @xmath64 configuration .",
    "revised spin values for the two bands have been proposed , based on the concepts of additivity and signature staggering .",
    "a second discontinuity in aligned spin has been observed for the first time in this nucleus and interpreted as a quasiproton band crossing .",
    "the observed alignment behaviors are found to be consistent with similar observations in the neighboring @xmath160ta ( odd-@xmath6 ) and @xmath17hf ( odd-@xmath7 ) nuclei . in the csm calculations ,",
    "a complex pattern of alignments involving @xmath158 and @xmath139 proton orbitals is predicted at high rotational frequencies .",
    "a fully consistent picture has yet to emerge in order to explain the high - frequency alignments observed in @xmath0ta and other nuclei in this mass region .",
    "a dedicated experiment optimized to populate @xmath0ta would likely reveal additional band structures , such as those associated with the @xmath161 configuration which is expected to be yrast at the highest spins .",
    "such a measurement could help resolve the alignment puzzles at high frequency discussed in the present work .",
