    "top quark production at the fermilab tevatron probes very high mass scales , @xmath1 , and therefore is sensitive to new physics at this scale .",
    "hence , it is important that we studied this process with high precision and compare the results with the standard model predictions .",
    "also the top quark mass along with the w - boson mass can be used as an indirect measurement of the higgs boson mass or even demonstrate the failure of the standard model .",
    "therefore we must measure the top quark mass with the greatest precision possible with the events available to us .    here",
    "i review the status of the cross section calculations for top quark production not only for the total cross section but also for the shape of the various distributions associated with the production . for the kinematic measurement of the top quark mass",
    "the effects of extra gluon radiation are important for precision measurements .",
    "i will discuss the status of our understanding of this extra radiation .",
    "finally , i will present a few of the possibilities for new physics that can dramatically change top quark production not only in total rate but also in the shape of the kinematic distributions .",
    "in hadron colliders the dominant mode of top quark production is via quark - antiquark annihilation or gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath2 currently , the most accurate determination of the qcd top cross section is the resummed next to leading order ( re@xmath3 nlo ) calculation of laenen , smith and van neerven@xcite . fig .",
    "1 is a comparison of this re@xmath3 nlo calculation and the exact nlo calculation of ellis@xcite for both the @xmath4 channel and the @xmath5 channel at the fermilab tevatron . clearly , the @xmath5 channel has larger corrections from these resummed soft gluons .",
    "however , for large top quark mass at the tevatron , this channel is only a small part of the total cross section .",
    "( a)(b )    fig .",
    "2 is a similar comparison for the total cross section . at large top quark masses",
    "the difference between the re@xmath3 nlo calculation and the nlo calculation is at the 20% level . at the lhc where the @xmath5 channel will be the dominant production mode these resummed corrections will be a much larger correction to the total cross section .",
    "the resummation technique of laenen , smith and van neerven involves a infra - red cutoff which is set appropriately .",
    "contopanagos and sterman @xcite have pioneered a resummation technique , principal value resummation , which does not involve such an arbitrary cutoff . this method has been applied to top production at the tevatron by berger and contopanagos @xcite . at the time of this conference",
    "they had completed the @xmath4 channel but were still working on the @xmath5 channel .",
    "the results using the principal value resummation for the less sensitive @xmath4 channel are in close agreement with the infra - red cutoff resummation .",
    "the completion of this calculation for the total cross section is important for determining how well we know the total top quark cross section .",
    "( a)(b)(c )    ( a)(b)(c )    kidonakis and smith@xcite have calculated the inclusive transverse momentum and rapidity distributions for top quark production at the fermilab tevatron using the infra - red cutoff resummation technique . a comparison of these results to the next leading order calculation for the transverse momentum of the top quark",
    "is shown in fig . 3 and for the rapidity in fig .",
    "frixione , mangano , nason and ridolfi @xcite have calculated a number of distributions for top quark production in nlo and made comparisons with the herwig monte carlo . in fig .",
    "5 , i show from their paper the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath0 pair , the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0 pair and the azimuthal distribution of the @xmath0 pair . these last two distributions are trivial at lowest order so it is satisfying to see that the two calculations are comparable in the region where we expect approximate agreement .",
    "( a)(b)(c )",
    "for precision measurements of the top quark mass , we need to understand the effects of extra gluon radiation in top quark production .",
    "this has been studied by lampe@xcite , orr and stirling@xcite and most recently by orr , stelzer and stirling @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 , i show the results of orr , stelzer and stirling , for the invariant mass of the w - boson and b - quark jet without and with an extra gluon jet . clearly",
    "the results of the mass fitting are sensitive to how this extra jet is treated .",
    "therefore it is important that we understand this process very well for precision top quark mass measurements .",
    "orr , stelzer and stirling have also compared their exact tree - level calculation with the herwig monte carlo , see fig .",
    "the difference between these two calculation , i believe , is dependent upon how the top quark mass is included in the monte carlo .",
    "this discrepancy is still to be resolved .",
    "further discussion on this problem can be found in orr , stelzer and stirling @xcite which addresses this issue in the simpler environment of an e+e- collider .",
    "since the top quark mass is close to the electro - weak symmetry breaking scale it is possible that top quark production will provide an exciting window on new physics .",
    "( a)(b )    hill and parke @xcite have shown the effects of new physics on top production in the @xmath4 channel using both a general effective lagrangian approach as well as in a specific top color model .",
    "8(a ) gives the distortions in the @xmath0 invariant mass in the color octet top color model for various masses of the top color boson .",
    "later eichten and lane @xcite discussed the effects on top quark product in a multi - scalar technicolor model . here",
    "the enhanced production is in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "8(b ) is their invariant mass plot .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath0 production is in good shape for the fermilab tevatron .",
    "new calculations which include higher order effects give small contributions .",
    "therefore the uncertainties in this cross section are well under control .",
    "many differential cross section have also been calculated , some simple ones using the re@xmath3 nlo techniques while others which are trivial at tree level have been calculated at nlo .    the effects of extra gluon radiation in the determination of the top quark mass is still under study .",
    "i expect that the discrepancy between the tree level matrix element calculation and the herwig monte carlo will be resolved in the near future .",
