    "as one important paradigm in the studies of quantum chaos and quantum - classical correspondence , the kicked rotor ( kr ) model  @xcite has received tremendous theoretical and experimental interest in the last three decades  @xcite .",
    "for some experimental activities on kr within the last three years , we would like to mention those listed in ref .",
    "a one - dimensional kr is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 in terms of dimensionless variables , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are conjugate ( angular ) momentum and angle variables , @xmath6 and @xmath10 are the kick strength and the period of the @xmath11-kicks . the dynamical evolution of the system for a period from time @xmath12 to @xmath13 can be expressed as a quantum map , which is given by the following unitary floquet operator @xmath14 for our considerations below , we confine ourselves to a rotor hilbert space defined by the periodic boundary condition in @xmath9 , with @xmath15 .",
    "the hilbert space can then be represented by the eigenfunctions @xmath16 of @xmath8 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 being an integer , and @xmath20 being a dimensionless effective planck constant . through extensive numerical simulations and mathematical analysis ,",
    "it is now well known that in general the kr dynamics can be classified into two categories  @xcite . for an irrational ( hence generic ) value of @xmath21 the system can diffuse in ( angular )",
    "momentum space only for a short time due to `` dynamical localization '' , regardless of the kick strength .",
    "this hints at a discrete spectrum of @xmath22 and is closely related to anderson localization  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath21 being a rational multiple of @xmath0 ( except for odd multiples of @xmath0 ) , @xmath22 has continuous bands : a time - evolving state would keep spreading out in ( angular ) momentum space ballistically .",
    "this category of dynamics was termed as `` quantum resonance ''  @xcite .",
    "another important quantum chaos model is the kicked harper model ( khm )  @xcite , originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as an approximation of the problem of kicked charges in a magnetic field .",
    "remarkably , the khm and even a whole class of its generalized versions were shown to be equivalent to the problem of a charge kicked periodically in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the associated khm quantum map for each period is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 being an additional system parameter .",
    "throughout we assume the khm is also treated in the same hilbert space as the kr and is quantized on a rotor hilbert space . the dynamics of khm differs from that of kr as described above in several aspects .",
    "for example , for all irrational values of @xmath25 , the system in general tends to delocalize ( localize ) in ( angular ) momentum space for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the symmetric case of @xmath28 , for which the quasi - energy spectrum of @xmath29 is fractal - like in general .",
    "scanning the spectrum collectively for fixed @xmath30 versus a varying @xmath20 forms a pattern that resembles the hofstadter s butterfly spectrum  @xcite , a paradigm in studies of the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "the associated dynamics is extended in general and may be connected with the fractal dimensions of the floquet spectrum .    given the above - mentioned differences between kr and khm , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by two of the authors emerged somewhat unexpectedly .",
    "there it was shown that a variant of kr also has hofstadter s butterfly spectrum .",
    "in particular , motivated by the double - kicked rotor model studied both experimentally and theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is a special case of  multiple kr s \" first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite studied a double - kicked model under a quantum - resonance condition . for a total period of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "a double kicked rotor model is associated with two periodic @xmath11-kicks of strengths @xmath6 and @xmath24 , separated by a time interval set to be unity , yielding the following floquet operator @xmath33 in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 is chosen to satisfy the quantum resonance condition @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath35 due to the discreteness of the momentum eigenvalues .",
    "this leads us to an on - resonance double kicked rotor model ( ordkr ) , whose floquet operator is given by @xcite : @xmath36 note that we have deliberately used symbols @xmath6 and @xmath24 in both @xmath29 and @xmath37 because in this paper , parameter @xmath6 or parameter @xmath24 from both models will always be assigned the same value .",
    "experimental realization of such an ordkr propagator in atom optics is possible by loading a bose - einstein - condensate ( bec ) in a kicking optical lattice , with the initial quasi - momentum spread of the bec negligibly small as compared with the recoil momentum of the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath20 being an irrational multiple of @xmath0 , the ordkr and the khm share the same quasi - energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "our main plan for this paper is to make some detailed comparisons between khm and ordkr as two closely related dynamical models , both possessing hofstadter s butterfly spectrum .",
    "our motivations are as follows .",
    "first of all , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that @xmath37 and @xmath29 have different spectra if @xmath20 is a rational multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath25 approaches an arbitrary irrational number , the spectral difference between @xmath37 and @xmath29 , which is characterized by a hausdorff metric in ref .",
    "@xcite , was shown to approach zero .",
    "it is therefore highly worthwhile looking into the actual spectral differences for rational values of @xmath25 , because , up to a classical canonical transformation , ordkr and khm have exactly the same classical limit  @xcite ( obtained by letting @xmath20 approach zero while fixing @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "indeed , given their equivalence in the classical limit , the spectral differences we analyze constitute beautiful examples to illustrate how quantization of classically equivalent systems may lead to remarkable system - specific consequences .",
    "second , by working on the details we hope to find some clues as to why the dynamics of ordkr can be so different from that of khm .",
    "we indeed succeed in doing this , finding that even on a qualitative level , the floquet bands of ordkr behave much differently from that of khm , for @xmath40 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being coprime and both odd . in particular , we shall prove the existence of a flat floquet band @xcite for ordkr with @xmath28 , which may be of interest to current studies of strongly correlated condensed - matter systems with an almost flat energy band @xcite .",
    "the existence of a flat floquet band has been shown elsewhere to be important in explaining the intriguing exponential quantum spreading dynamics in ordkr  @xcite .",
    "third , motivated by recent interests in topological characterization of periodically driven systems  @xcite and given the interesting relationship of the two models described previously , we ask whether , after all , ordkr and khm have any interesting topological connections . based on our numerical and analytical studies , the answer is yes and we shall claim that ordkr and khm are topologically equivalent in the sense that their extended floquet bands ( obtained upon introducing a phase shift parameter defined in sec .",
    "iii ) always have the same band chern numbers .",
    "this paper is organized in the following order . in sec .",
    "ii we present detailed results regarding a spectral comparison between khm and ordkr , for @xmath28 , and @xmath40 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being coprime and odd integers .",
    "numerical findings will be described first , followed by analytical considerations when possible ( e.g. , band width scaling for a three - band case and the general proof of a flat band for ordkr ) .",
    "the implications of peculiar spectral properties of ordkr for its dynamics are also discussed via some numerical studies . in sec .",
    "iii we study the khm and ordkr by extending them to accommodate a new periodic parameter and demonstrating the topological equivalence of the resulting extended models .",
    "section iv concludes this paper .",
    "as far as numerics are concerned , the spectrum of the unitary operators can be obtained in a straightforward manner . for completeness",
    "we describe some details here .",
    "the key step is to take advantage of the periodic property of @xmath29 or @xmath37 in the ( angular ) momentum space , which arises naturally for @xmath20 being a rational multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "denote @xmath41 to refer to either @xmath29 or @xmath37 .",
    "letting @xmath42 , one easily finds @xmath43 for @xmath40 .",
    "this indicates a unit cell in ( angular ) momentum space , with a size of @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum is then equivalent to that of a reduced @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 , whose elements are given by @xmath46_{j , k}=\\sum\\limits_{l } e^{il\\varphi}u_{j , k+ln}$ ] , with @xmath47 being the bloch phase in momentum space and @xmath48 running over all integers .",
    "as off - diagonal elements of @xmath49 decay exponentially , the summation in @xmath50 can be truncated safely at certain large enough value of @xmath51 ( in our analytical studies below , we do not do such truncations ) .",
    "numerical results are then checked by further increasing the truncation radius .",
    "once @xmath52 is numerically obtained , the standard diagonalization algorithm for a unitary matrix can be exploited to obtain @xmath3 values of quasi - energy @xmath53 . by varying @xmath54 in @xmath55 we have @xmath3 floquet bands .",
    "-1.0 cm -0.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ squid ] we show our obtained quasi - energy values of @xmath37 and @xmath29 as a function of the kick strength @xmath6 .",
    "though for each fixed value of @xmath6 , we only show the quasi - energy values for a limited number of bloch phase choices , the locations of the bands , the band width , and a few avoided band crossings can already be seen clearly for not too large values of @xmath28 . in particular , at @xmath56 , nice floquet bands can be identified clearly for both ordkr and khm , though for very large values of @xmath6 the merging of the bands does occur .",
    "spectral differences between @xmath37 and @xmath29 in the shown example are also obvious . based on the results shown in fig .",
    "[ squid ] , we have carried out extensive numerical investigations for other cases with @xmath40 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 coprime and both odd . some of the main features are presented and commented on below .",
    "first , the band structure of @xmath37 is symmetric with respect to the zero quasi - energy axis , which is however not the case for @xmath29 .",
    "this interesting symmetry is absent in both @xmath29 and @xmath22 .",
    "we shall prove this property below .",
    "second , consistent with the above - mentioned symmetry , @xmath37 is seen to have a flat band with @xmath57 . by flat band , we mean that this quasi - energy value is independent of the bloch phase @xmath54 .",
    "so the overall picture is that the @xmath3 bands can be classified into @xmath58 pairs , with each pair having opposite quasi - energy values , plus a flat band in the middle .",
    "again , this is not the case for @xmath29 .",
    "the existence of a flat floquet band was previously observed in studies of the quantum antiresonance phenomenon in kicked systems @xcite . however , unless in the case of @xmath59 ( @xmath2 odd ) that also corresponds to a quantum antiresonance condition , here the flat band of @xmath37 coexists with other nonflat bands .",
    "this coexistence of a flat band with nonflat bands constitutes an interesting feature . as a side note , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that for a kr defined in this paper under the quantum resonance condition of any order ( i.e. , @xmath60 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 arbitrary coprime integers ) , none of the floquet bands of @xmath22 is flat .",
    "so the existence of one single flat band of @xmath37 is also remarkable as compared with @xmath22 .",
    "-0.90 cm -0.5 cm    third , the largest bandwidth of the other @xmath4 non - flat floquet bands of ordkr scales with @xmath6 as @xmath5 , in the limit of @xmath61 . in sharp contrast , the bandwidths of khm scale with @xmath6 linearly .",
    "representative numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ bw ] , where the bandwidth of the widest band is plotted against small values of @xmath6 , for @xmath40 , with @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the power law decay of the ordkr bandwidth in the form of @xmath5 can be clearly identified , whereas the bandwidth of khm remains a linear function of @xmath6 , irrespective of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "this being the case , in the small @xmath6 regime ( @xmath64 ) , the maximum bandwidths of ordkr is @xmath65 times narrower than that of khm .",
    "flat bands in solid - state systems are of vast interest in condensed matter physics because they offer new opportunities for understanding strongly correlated systems without landau levels .",
    "for this reason the existence of a flat band in a periodically driven system can be useful , too . to further understand the flat band of ordkr , we present a theoretical proof in this subsection . in doing",
    "so we shall also prove the band symmetry noted above .",
    "we shall also discuss how an eigenstate on a flat band , which is infinitely degenerate , may be numerically found .",
    "for @xmath40 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being coprime integers , the spectrum becomes that of a reduced @xmath44 floquet matrix with elements @xmath66_{n , m}=\\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty } { \\left\\langle n\\right|}{\\hat u}_{\\text{ordkr}}{\\left| m+l\\times n\\right\\rangle } e^{il\\varphi}$ ] . after performing some necessary integrals and using the fact that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are odd",
    ", one can express @xmath67_{n , m}$ ] as a summation of finite terms ( see appendix for details ) . in the following discussions regarding the existence of a flat band and the band inversion symmetry",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the cases of @xmath28 ( note however , in the next section , the notation introduced here will be extended to the cases with @xmath68 ) .",
    "we first introduce diagonal unitary matrices @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and unitary matrix @xmath72 , with matrix elements @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where indices @xmath19 and @xmath77 take values @xmath78 . note that in obtaining our expression for @xmath79 , we made use of the fact that @xmath80 .",
    "we then have the following compact form for the reduced floquet matrix @xmath81    to prove that there is a flat band for ordkr , we show that @xmath82 has an eigenvalue equal to one , regardless of the value of @xmath54 .",
    "consider then a matrix @xmath83 transformed from @xmath82 by a unitary operation @xmath84 , which takes the form @xmath85 the eigenvalue equation of @xmath83 may be rewritten as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 denotes an eigenvector , and @xmath89 is an eigenvalue of @xmath90 .",
    "detailed calculations show that @xmath91 is a symmetric matrix ( see appendix for details ) and since @xmath92 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath93 must be an antisymmetric matrix of odd dimension",
    ". it immediately follows @xmath94 .",
    "thus , regardless of the bloch phase @xmath54 , @xmath95 is a permissible solution to eq .",
    "( [ neweigeneq ] ) .",
    "we have thus shown that @xmath90 always has a unity eigenvalue or zero quasi - energy for @xmath40 .",
    "this is nothing but the existence of a flat floquet band .    our considerations above also lead us to a proof of the band inversion symmetry of ordkr for odd @xmath2 and @xmath3 . specifically , because @xmath96 , we see that if @xmath97 , then @xmath98 as well . that is , both @xmath89 and @xmath99 are solutions to the eigenvalue equation of eq .",
    "( [ neweigeneq ] ) . as such ,",
    "if we have a quasi - energy @xmath100 , we must have @xmath101 in the spectrum .",
    "this completes our proof of the inversion symmetry of the ordkr",
    ".    a flat band is infinitely degenerate as states on the band can still have a continuous bloch phase @xmath54 .",
    "due to such an independence upon the bloch phase ,",
    "the band dispersion relation directly yields a zero group velocity in the ( angular ) momentum space , thus indicating a zero mobility in the ( angular ) momentum space .",
    "further , the infinite degeneracy allows us to construct a flat - band eigenstate that is localized in the ( angular ) momentum space ( though the floquet operator itself is periodic in momentum with a period @xmath102 ) .",
    "it is interesting to outline a simple approach to the construction of flat - band states .",
    "it is found that , highly localized flat - band states can be obtained by directly truncating the full floquet matrix @xmath103 to a small size , such that there is only one eigenstate whose eigenvalue is real and still equals to unity ( thus not affected by the truncation ) .",
    "other localized states on the flat band can be obtained by shifting it by a multiple of n sites , or by superimposing these states localized at different locations .",
    "figure  [ eigenstate ] depicts one computational example of a flat - band eigenstate strongly localized in the ( angular ) momentum space .",
    "we have checked that if we use a flat - band state we constructed as the initial state for time evolution , then indeed this state does not evolve with iterations of our ordkr quantum map .",
    "this situation is more subtle than the quantum antiresonance phenomenon @xcite : for ordkr with multiple bands , only special states prepared on the single flat band can remain localized , whereas in the case of quantum antiresonance an arbitrary state should remain localized .",
    "-0.5 cm      for @xmath40 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being coprime integers , the reduced @xmath44 floquet matrices @xmath82 and @xmath104 ( see our general expressions in the appendix ) can be obtained analytically . to further understand and confirm the bandwidth scaling of ordkr and khm ,",
    "we have also carried out analytical studies for a three - band case , with @xmath28 and @xmath105 .    for ordkr ,",
    "the three eigenvalues are found to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "one finally finds @xmath109\\}$ ] where @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath111 it can be shown that the edges of the band correspond to @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the bandwidth can thus be determined to be @xmath114/3\\right\\ } -\\arccos\\left[\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\cos\\left(\\frac{3k}{2\\hbar}\\right)\\right]$ ] .",
    "taylor expanding this expression for the bandwidth , we find the first nonzero term to be @xmath115 , a clear power - law scaling of @xmath116 .    for khm",
    ", the eigenvalues can be deduced from the equation @xmath117 .",
    "the resulting explicit expression of the eigenvalue equation is @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "note that all eigenvalues are in the form of @xmath120 , since the reduced floquet matrix is always unitary .",
    "the three eigenvalues are found to be @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 where @xmath124 . for @xmath111 , the edges of the band correspond to @xmath125 and @xmath126 . the band width can thus be determined to be @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "taylor expanding the expressions of eigevalues for @xmath130 and keeping the lowest order in @xmath6 , we have @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , a clear linear scaling of k.    -0.0 cm    the very fast decay of the floquet bandwidth of ordkr suggests that in a considerable range of @xmath6 the bandwidths will be very narrow . in other words , for a small @xmath6 , all the floquet bandwidths would be effectively zero for a reasonably long time scale .",
    "therefore , when it comes to the dynamical evolution of the system , effectively the system will not feel its continuous floquet spectrum and hence displays localization behavior , for a time scale inversely proportional to the bandwidths .",
    "we call this the time scale of transient dynamical localization and denote it by @xmath134 .",
    "we then have @xmath135 .",
    "the overall expectation is the following : within @xmath134 , ordkr displays localization in the ( angular ) momentum space , but afterwards it begins to show ballistic behavior in the ( angular ) momentum space . because of the power law scaling , the intriguing time scale @xmath134 can be very sensitive to a change in the kick strength @xmath6 .",
    "our numerical calculations indeed confirm this .",
    "figure  [ p2t](a ) shows an example of the dynamics of the kinetic energy of ordkr , starting from an initial state with zero momentum . in all three of the shown cases ,",
    "the kinetic energy is seen to freeze over a time scale before it starts to increase ballistically .",
    "the time scale of the freezing stage is shown to increase rapidly as we decrease the value of @xmath6 . as a comparison",
    ", figure  [ p2t](b ) shows the parallel dynamics of khm , for the same three values of @xmath6 .",
    "there it is seen that the transient stage of localization is only weakly dependent upon @xmath6 , which is again consistent with the linear @xmath6-dependence of the bandwidth of khm .",
    "quantitatively , the transient localization time scale @xmath134 is numerically determined from the duration of kinetic energy freezing .",
    "the @xmath134 thus obtained numerically and shown in fig .",
    "[ p2t](c ) indeed satisfies the scaling @xmath135 for ordkr , which is in sharp contrast to the @xmath136 scaling for khm .",
    "the results here can also be understood as a quantitative explanation of our earlier finding of transient dynamical localization in ref .",
    "@xcite . for future experiments",
    ", the observation of the aforementioned scaling of @xmath134 versus @xmath6 may serve as the first piece of evidence of a successful realization of an ordkr .",
    "in this section , we devote ourselves to a detailed comparison of the floquet band topologies of ordkr and khm .",
    "we first describe our motivation and introduce new notation .",
    "next , we report numerical findings of the floquet band topological numbers of both models .",
    "finally , an exact analytical proof of the topological equivalence between ordkr and khm is presented .",
    "one early study @xcite suggested that topological properties of the floquet bands of khm may be connected with the regular - to - chaos transition in the classical limit .",
    "because ordkr and khm share the same classical limit ( up to a canonical transformation ) , we suspect that there should be some similarity in their floquet band topologies .",
    "our second motivation for a topological study is related to an earlier finding that , when @xmath25 is a _ rational _ number , the spectral union of @xmath137 ( variant of ordkr defined below ) over all @xmath138 is the same as that of @xmath139 ( variant khm defined below ) over all @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this previous mathematical result further suggests a possible topological connection between the two models .",
    "interestingly , as we explore this possible topological connection , we are able to see a connection between khm propagator and ordkr propagator for each individual value of @xmath138 along with an individual value of the bloch phase , thus going beyond ref .  @xcite that considered a unification of all values of @xmath138 and the bloch phase .",
    "further , as we shall see below , the connection is established by a mapping in the parameter space , which can not be achieved by a unitary transformation between the two propagators .",
    "next , we introduce necessary notation for our discussion of band topology . to characterize the band topology for both ordkr and khm , we introduce an additional periodic phase parameter @xmath140 to the ordkr and khm maps , namely , @xmath141 for @xmath40 , both operators are periodic in ( angular ) momentum space with period @xmath102 . hence , their eigenvalues are @xmath0-periodic in the bloch phase @xmath54 and also in @xmath138 , giving rise to @xmath3 _ extended _ floquet bands which disperse as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath138 .",
    "these 2-dimensional bands may be topologically characterized by chern numbers , denoted @xmath142 for the @xmath77th band . in what follows ,",
    "we denote @xmath143 as an ( generalized ) eigenstate of either @xmath137 or @xmath139 , in the @xmath77th band , with an eigenvalue @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "such a generalized eigenstate lives on the entire ( angular ) momentum space .",
    "we then denote @xmath145 as the reduced @xmath44 floquet matrix constructed from either @xmath137 or @xmath139 using the method described at the beginning of section ii .",
    "we next define the state @xmath146 , which is @xmath143 projected onto @xmath3 sites of one unit cell in the ( angular ) momentum space , i.e. , @xmath147 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath146 is normalized over one unit cell consisting of @xmath3 sites . using the above notation",
    ", the berry curvature of the @xmath77th band is then defined as  @xcite @xmath148 where we have suppressed the explicit dependences on @xmath54 and @xmath138 for brevity . from the berry curvature",

    "we find that for the same @xmath6 and @xmath24 respectively in both models , the chern numbers are always equal .",

    "states launched from a flat band will be strictly localized , and this feature might be useful for benchmarking experimental errors in any future realizations of ordkr . the coexistence of a flat band with non - flat bands may also open up new applications of @xmath11-kicked systems .",

    "<S> recent studies have established that , in addition to the well - known kicked harper model ( khm ) , an on - resonance double kicked rotor model ( ordkr ) also has hofstadter s butterfly floquet spectrum , with strong resemblance to the standard hofstadter s spectrum that is a paradigm in studies of the integer quantum hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> earlier it was shown that the quasi - energy spectra of these two dynamical models ( i ) can exactly overlap with each other if an effective planck constant takes irrational multiples of @xmath0 and ( ii ) will be different if the same parameter takes rational multiples of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this work makes some detailed comparisons between these two models , with an effective planck constant given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are coprime and odd integers . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the ordkr spectrum ( with two periodic kicking sequences having the same kick strength ) has one flat band and @xmath4 non - flat bands whose largest width decays in power law as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a kicking strength parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a flat band is strictly proven and the power law scaling , numerically checked for a number of cases , is also analytically proven for a three - band case . by contrast , the khm does not have any flat band and its band width scales linearly with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown to result in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior , such as transient ( but extremely long ) dynamical localization in ordkr , which is absent in khm . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that despite these differences , there exist simple extensions of khm and ordkr ( upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter ) such that the resulting extended khm and ordkr are actually topologically equivalent , i.e. , they yield exactly the same floquet - band chern numbers and display topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical derivation of this topological equivalence is provided . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also of interest to our current understanding of quantum - classical correspondence considering that khm and ordkr have exactly the same classical limit after a simple canonical transformation . </S>"
