    "in biological systems , water is present in a wide range of environments . as a highly polar molecule",
    ", water tends to trap low - energy electrons ( lees ) and is expected to play an important role in lee - induced processes @xcite .",
    "electron collisions with water vapour being the simplest to study , extensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work has been carried out . in the more complicated condensed phase systems , experimental studies of electron scattering from amorphous solid water , porous amorphous solid water and crystalline ice",
    "have been reported @xcite . in water clusters ,",
    "formation of ( h@xmath0o)@xmath1 by attachment of slow electrons has also been investigated @xcite in order to elucidate the mechanism of electron solvation . to our knowledge ,",
    "no theoretical investigation of electron scattering with clusters or condensed water have been reported ; available methods are mainly developed for electron collisions with gas - phase molecules .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to develop a new theoretical approach for condensed - matter and cluster environments especially since many electron - driven processes occur in these media .",
    "the main idea behind the multiple scattering ( ms ) method is to separate the potential of a complex target into non - overlapping regions with each region taken as a single scatterer . the impinging wave on each scatterer is composed of the incident plane wave and the wave scattered from the other scattering centres .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that one can determine the cross section for large systems by combining information from its subunits .",
    "this enables the study of larger targets ( macromolecules , molecular clusters , etc . )",
    "than is possible using the methods currently available .",
    "the ms approach to lee scattering was previously proposed by two of the authors ( l. caron and l. sanche ) @xcite and its use in conjunction with r - matrix calculations was recently validated @xcite ( hereafter referred to as i ) .",
    "the proposed approach combines scattering gas - phase data , obtained from accurate _ ab initio _ r - matrix calculations , to derive scattering information for a condensed - matter situation .",
    "the partitioning of the space in the r - matrix method makes it ideal for a multiple scattering approach of the `` muffin - tin '' type .",
    "the method is forcibly less rigorous than the ones available for small gas - phase targets , but it is fast and , for the systems tested so far , yields very good results .    in i",
    ", we have used the ms theory in the condensed phase , using the equivalent kkr ( korringa , kohn , and rostoker ) approach , in combination with gas - phase r - matrix data in the form of t - matrices .",
    "we were able to derive the band structure of a molecular crystal ( ice ) .",
    "the present work constitutes a first attempt to determine elastic cross section ( cs ) for lee scattering from a molecular cluster using the ms approach .",
    "the water dimer is an excellent choice for such an attempt , primarily because , making use of our previous experience in electron - h@xmath0o collisions @xcite , we were able to perform accurate r - matrix calculations of electron - dimer collisions and test the ms technique .",
    "in addition , water is present in a large variety of environments and information on lee interactions with it is highly relevant .",
    "for example , the characteristics of the water in some of the solvation layers surrounding the double - helix structure of dna are not that of bulk water @xcite , so may be explained in terms of clustered h@xmath0o .",
    "the main question we address in this paper is whether a multiple scattering approach is a good alternative to the computationally heavy _",
    "ab initio _",
    "methods for large to very large targets . for this purpose , we investigate how to apply the cut - offs found in i in order to perform a ms calculation of lee collision with the water dimer .",
    "in this section we present a multiple scattering method to calculate the total t - matrix , @xmath2 , describing lee collisions from a target consisting of two identical scatterers from their individual t - matrices @xmath3 .",
    "the monomers , labelled with the index @xmath4 , are located at @xmath5 .",
    "the asymptotic wave function far away from the centre of mass of the two molecules can be expressed as follows :    @xmath6 f_{l}^{0}~.   \\label{eq_0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the relative coordinate of the scattered electron and the centre of mass of the target .",

    "the first term on the right side of ( [ eq_0 ] ) corresponds to the total incident wave and the second to the total scattered wave .",
    "we need to re - expand the incident wave in ( [ eq_0 ] ) around the centre of mass of each scatterer @xmath4 .",
    "we use the general re - expansion formula from which , for the spherical harmonics defined by messiah @xcite , is    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and@xmath17 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left",

    "it follows that the incident wave on each scatterer is :    @xmath19    where @xmath20or , in matrix form @xmath21with @xmath22    we can now incorporate the multiple scattering between the two scatterers to obtain a global expression for the total impinging wave on each molecule .",

    "no experimental or theoretical data on elastic lee collisions with the water dimer are available . therefore , in order to test the quality of our ms results , we have performed an _ ab initio _ scattering calculation on the gas - phase dimer using the r - matrix method and the uk polyatomic r - matrix suite @xcite .",
    "the gas - phase water dimer in its ground state equilibrium geometry has @xmath40 symmetry ( figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the geometry parameters from were used in the r - matrix calculation .",
    "the geometry of the water monomer is very slightly changed upon dimer formation ( see table  [ tab : geometry ] ) . in the ms calculation ,",
    "the dimer was formed by putting together two water molecules separated by @xmath41  bohr along the z - axis .",
    "this means that there are very minor differences between the geometries used in the r - matrix and ms calculations .",
    "the most notable is the hydrogen bond r@xmath42 which is at most @xmath43  bohr longer in the dimer than in the monomers we use to build the ms results .",
    "a detailed description of the r - matrix method as applied to polyatomic molecules within the fixed - nuclei ( fn ) approximation can be found in and .",
    "the method is based on splitting coordinate space into two regions separated by a sphere , henceforth called r - sphere , centred on the centre of mass of the molecule .",
    "the radius of the r - sphere is chosen in such way that the electronic density of the target is negligible outside it . as a consequence ,",
    "exchange and correlation effects can be neglected in this outer region and a long - range multipole expansion used to represent the electron - target interaction . inside the r - sphere ,",
    "both effects are significant and are therefore taken into account using rigorous quantum chemistry methods .",
    "the wavefunction for the target  +  electron system is then expressed in terms of a close - coupling expansion .",
    "the calculation was performed following previous work on electron scattering from isolated h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "we used the equilibrium geometry from and the same basis set ( including the diffuse functions ) employed for the monomer work by .",
    "since in this work we are concerned with the elastic scattering , only the ground electronic state was considered and included in the close - coupling expansion .",
    "we therefore produced natural orbitals exclusively from this state and then used them in a casci ( complete active space configuration interaction ) calculation in which 8 electrons are frozen ; this generated around 7000 configurations . with this model",
    ", we obtained a good value for the ground state energy : -152.18  hartree , compared to -152.67  hartree from the most accurate calculation .",
    "we also obtained excellent agreement with the experimental dipole moment : 1.065  a.u . in our calculations compared to 1.041  a.u ..    we used an r - sphere radius of @xmath44=13  bohr . in order to confirm that all the electronic density was contained inside the sphere ,",
    "tests were performed for radii of @xmath44=14 and @xmath44=15  bohr . only small differences at very low energies were found between the cross sections calculated with the three radii @xcite .",
    "the continuum orbitals describing the scattered electron were expanded in a basis of gtos with @xmath45 centred on the centre of mass of the water molecule .      in i , we showed that gas - phase r - matrix data can be efficiently used in conjunction with ms theory in a non - gaseous environment by deriving the band structure of a molecular crystal ( ice ) .",
    "the fundamental lesson learnt from this kkr study is that for the multiple scattering term , we need a trimmed t matrix @xmath46 , without dipole contribution for radii @xmath47 and with an angular momentum cut - off . thus two different monomer t - matrices are needed : @xmath46 for the multiple scattering term @xmath48 and a matrix @xmath49 for which no cut - offs are applied . with this in mind",
    "[ eq : final ] can be rewritten : @xmath50    the first step in our multiple scattering calculation involves generating the monomer t - matrices @xmath46 and @xmath49 required in equation  ( [ eq : used ] ) .",
    "the description of lee scattering by an isolated h@xmath0o molecule is the same than in i. since a detailed description of the calculation was given there , we will limit ourselves here to a brief summary .",
    "we have used the r - matrix method within the fixed - nuclei approximation . for the target description we used the dzp basis set @xcite for the oxygen and a tz basis @xcite for the hydrogen .",
    "a casci model was used with only 2 frozen electrons and the calculation included only the ground state .",
    "the scattering calculation was performed with an r - sphere radius of @xmath51  bohr .",
    "a gto basis for the continuum with @xmath52 was generated for this radius using the program gtobas @xcite .",
    "the obtained t - matrices were rotated from the r - matrix coordinates to their corresponding position in the dimer .",
    "the procedure to do so was explained previously ( equation  ( 24 ) in i ) and the reader is referred to that work for further details .",
    "as mentioned above , two cut - offs are applied when generating @xmath46 . a first cut - off on the range of the molecular dipole",
    "is achieved by removing the dipole field for @xmath47",
    ". the cut - off radius @xmath53 depends only on the dipole moment of the molecular monomer and should therefore be the same for the ice and the dimer calculations . in i",
    ", we have found that @xmath54  bohr yields the best value for the electron s effective mass in ice .",
    "an analysis of the electron-(isolated ) water cross section obtained for different values of @xmath53 supports this finding ( the reader is referred to fig . 1 in i ) : for too small cut - off radii ( @xmath55 ) , the high energy cross section is unphysical whereas for higher radii ( @xmath56 ) the cross section exhibits a dipole - driven behaviour ( it increases rapidly at low energy ) .",
    "although this behaviour is physical and should be expected , it is the aim of the cut - off to at least partially eliminate it .",
    "this can be understood as an attempt to ensure that @xmath46 involves only the contribution of the target potential in the small region around the scatterer . that leaves @xmath57  bohr as the most satisfactory radius .",
    "the second cut - off , in the angular momentum components @xmath58 of the scattering matrix , is critical and depends both on the electron kinetic energy @xmath13 and the intermolecular distance @xmath59 .",
    "the restriction is related to the angular momentum energy barrier @xmath60 .",
    "the kkr calculation predicts that only angular momentum values @xmath61 should be retained such that @xmath62 with @xmath63 ry .",
    "that is , only electrons that scatter from one monomer with energy larger than @xmath64 can reach the other one and undergo multiple scattering . in the dimer ,",
    "the two h@xmath0o molecules are separated by @xmath65  bohr ( almost the same intermolecular distance than in crystalline ice in i ) .",
    "we expect then to have the same cut - off criteria than in the kkr calculation .",
    "once the t - matrices for the monomer are calculated , the dimer t - matrix in equation  [ eq : used ] is built . from it , we build the r - matrix at @xmath66  bohr using the approach given in appendix a and propagate it outwards @xcite using _ the exact dipolar field of the dimer_. this is necessary in order to incorporate the effect of the dipole moment of the dimer in the ms description . to choose @xmath67 we propagate the r - matrix of the dimer ( obtained with the r - matrix calculation ) inwards from the asymptotic region and then calculate the cs from it .",
    "the low - energy part of this cs decreases the more of the dipole field we remove ( the further in we go ) and takes an unsuspected and incorrect upturn for a radial distance of 9  bohr .",
    "we believe that for this distance the multipolar field of the dimer is no longer describable by its total dipole field .",
    "we finally generate the final t - matrix @xmath2 which takes the dimer s dipole contribution into account .",
    "this t - matrix is a function of energy and of the angular momentum cut - off @xmath68 used for @xmath46 in the multiple scattering term of eq .",
    "[ eq : used ] .",
    "the integral elastic cross section is then obtained using the well known formula :    @xmath69    in figure  [ fig : test_l ] , we present the cs for different @xmath68 values . as mentioned earlier , the partial wave expansion must be limited as the collision energy decreases .",
    "for example , for electron energies between @xmath70 ev , the kkr calculation predicts that we can only include @xmath71 in the ms calculation .",
    "it can be easily seen from figure  [ fig : test_l ] , that the cs is ill behaved in this region ( below @xmath72 ev ) when @xmath73",
    ". a closer look at the cs for the other values of @xmath68 shows the presence of a critical energy below which the cs does not exhibit the right behaviour .",
    "these critical energies are at slightly lower energies than the value given by @xmath74 .",
    "if we scrupulously restrict the calculation to integer values of @xmath68 for electron energies between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the cs will be jagged _",
    "i.e. _ discontinuous at @xmath74 .",
    "smoothing is needed .",
    "a two - point interpolation on the parameter @xmath58 between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath58 is the solution of @xmath78 , would get rid of the discontinuities .",
    "but this would admix the cs at @xmath76 with any singular part of the cs at @xmath77 .",
    "a quick look at figure  [ fig : test_l ] indicates , for instance , that at 6 ev when @xmath79 the interpolation would spuriously bring in a sizable part of the huge peak of the @xmath80 cs .",
    "the procedure can be regularised by upward shifting @xmath74 using a parameter @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",
    "a value of @xmath83 would shift the cut - off energies to the new values shown in figure  [ fig : test_l ] , beyond the threshold of the singular behaviour of the cs for @xmath77 .",
    "the interpolation procedure can now be done safely with @xmath58 a solution of @xmath84 .",
    "the cs is linearly interpolated between cs values corresponding to the closest lower and larger integer values of @xmath58 .",
    "the elastic electron-(h@xmath0o)@xmath0 cross section versus impact energy is plotted in figure  [ fig : xs_final ] . as a test of the accuracy of the ms calculation",
    ", we compare our results to the cs calculated with the r - matrix codes .",
    "the agreement between the two calculation is very good .",
    "the multiple scattering cross section is slightly higher than the r - matrix one but remains within 5% of the the fully _ ab initio _",
    "cs for energies larger than 2.5 ev .",
    "we believe these differences are well within the range of usual experimental errors and ab initio calculation uncertainties . for targets with large dipole moments ,",
    "it is customary to add to the r - matrix cross section a born based correction @xcite to account for the partial waves not included in the _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "this correction is the same for the r - matrix and ms calculations and for this reason has not been included in the cross sections plotted in figure  [ fig : xs_final ] .",
    "based on the results of i , the need for a `` trimmed '' t - matrix ( @xmath46 ) in the ms term of ( [ eq : used ] ) is obvious .",
    "figure  [ fig : test_l ] illustrates the drastic impact of a larger angular momentum basis ; including higher @xmath58 at low energies introduces resonances and/or premature divergences in the cs caused by the resonant nature of the ms @xmath85 term in eq .  [ eq : used ] . the cut - off in the long - range dipolar interaction is also very important . in i , we have shown that even though the value of the cut - off @xmath53 is not critical for band structure calculations , a too large or too small cut - off radius has a noticeable effect on the value of the effective mass ( which was used for calibration purposes ) .",
    "the two cut - offs are necessary and have to be applied only to the ms term .",
    "the use of a full t - matrix @xmath49 in ( [ eq : used ] ) is , however , essential to get the right cs behaviour at low energies and to properly account for the potential produced by the dipole of a h@xmath0o molecule .",
    "the need for @xmath49 to include the dipole contribution arises from the fact that for @xmath86 , the scattering electron feels the individual dipoles of the isolated water molecules .",
    "the radius @xmath67 has to be chosen in a proper way .",
    "it must allow the separation between the regions where the individual water dipoles dominate the electron - molecule interaction ( @xmath87 ) and the region where the total dipole of the dimer dominates ( @xmath88 ) . based on a geometrical analysis ( figure  [ fig : r - spheres ] )",
    ", one can see that a radius of 9  bohr is an adequate choice . in order to check the appropriateness of this value",
    ", we have tried several r - sphere radii ranging from 6 to 13  bohr and confirmed that 9  bohr yields the best cross section .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : r - spheres ] , that a choice of @xmath89  bohr in our calculations does not exactly correspond to a non - overlapping potentials picture . for the spheres not to overlap we would need a radius around @xmath90  bohr .",
    "however , using such small radius does not provide a good representation of the target .",
    "this was already clear in i , where we established that small radii introduce a discontinuity at the boundary of the sphere that is too important to lead to good results .",
    "we have developed a technique to derive the total t - matrix of two scatterers from their individual t - matrices as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "the technique first involves finding the t - matrix describing the scattering for an isolated molecular target .",
    "these are then combined using eq .",
    "[ eq : used ] .",
    "our main conclusion is that two different t - matrices , with different constraints , are needed to represent the electron - dimer interaction : two cut - offs have to be applied only to the ms term ( @xmath46 but not @xmath49 ) . from the total t - matrix , the r - matrix at @xmath67",
    "is determined and then propagated to an asymptotic distance using the dipole moment of the cluster .",
    "this propagation is fundamental in order to incorporate the electron interaction with the true dimer dipole moment .",
    "one can argue that the need for @xmath49 and @xmath67 is a surface effect not present in the infinite crystal situation in i. in fact , the dimer is mostly surface .",
    "our results show that a multiple scattering calculation can efficiently replace a _ standard ab initio _ scattering calculation for this system . very good agreement is found between the ms and the r - matrix cross sections .",
    "the ms method should allow us to calculate elastic cross sections for small water clusters that are nevertheless too big to be studied _ ab initio_. the same value of @xmath53 should be employed and @xmath67 could be determined using the same geometrical considerations .",
    "how large a cluster could one attempt to treat using this procedure ? the cluster should have a large surface to volume ratio .",
    "the arguments presented in appendix b indicate that the number of water molecules should be much less than 500 . that leaves a lot of room for fair sized clusters .    for very large clusters , having a low surface to volume ratio , the general picture would be as follows .",
    "the physical space should be divided into three parts . in the innermost part ,",
    "the bulk of the cluster , ms theory using @xmath46 in a uniform background optical potential @xmath91 , measuring the average polarisation potential energy between the muffins , would be used as in i. note that the resonant ms @xmath92 term of eq .  ( [ eq : used ] ) , which has been freed of any spurious peaks through the angular momentum cut - off algorithm , will yet show peaks that correspond to damped electronic modes of the cluster .",
    "these are , for instance , the modes that were calculated for crystalline ice in i. then there would be a narrow surface region which adapts the bulk value of the optical potential to the vacuum level and in which @xmath46 would be used for the ms part and @xmath49 for the exit part .",
    "finally , there would be an outer region in which the r - matrix of the two inner regions can be propagated to infinity using the multipolar potential of the cluster .",
    "we have thus far discussed only elastic scattering .",
    "how can one deal with inelastic collisions ?",
    "although this is unchartered territory , the scenario will likely go as follows .",
    "in such a situation , new energy channels open up . for each of these",
    ", there will be energy - diagonal t - matrices @xmath93 and cross - energy ones @xmath94 .",
    "these will combine into a super - matrix @xmath95 .",
    "the rest would basically be a repeat of what we have done for a single channel .",
    "one would define the ms part @xmath46 with cut - offs on the range of the dipole and on the angular momentum basis .",
    "note that the latter is different for each energy channel .",
    "moreover , as the energy increases , larger and larger angular momenta will be needed . some adjustments on @xmath53 might also be required in order to include inelastic channels involving more extended molecular wavefunctions .",
    "formally , eq .  ( [ eq : used ] ) still applies to these super matrices . the resonant ms @xmath48 term would not only exhibit peaks related to the damped electronic modes of the cluster but also structures caused by the inelastic contributions to @xmath46 which will in turn modulate the inelastic peaks in @xmath49 .",
    "interpolation of the total cs would now involve linear interpolation of the type described above in a multi - dimensional energy - channel space .",
    "the computer time consuming aspect comes from repeated cluster calculations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : used ] ) for many values of the incoming electron energy @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this research is supported by the canadian institutes of health research and the epsrc .",
    "we suppose in the following , that the r - matrix defined at a radius @xmath98 describes the inner region @xmath99 and that the potential outside the sphere is zero . for elastic scattering",
    "we have @xcite , @xmath100 _ { r = a}~.   \\label{eq_r}\\]]with @xmath101 the reduced radial wavefunctions .    for @xmath102 , the wavefunction representing the scattering electron is@xmath103    in the region @xmath104",

    "@xmath108 is a solution of energy @xmath109 and angular momentum @xmath110 of the schrdinger equation in a zero potential . substituting ( [ eq_f ] ) in ( [ eq_r ] ) , we have@xmath111 ~,\\]]where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "one can rearrange this equation and write it in matrix form@xmath114where @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the amplitude column vectors .",
    "this gives us : @xmath118 we introduce the k - matrix , @xmath119 substituting ( [ eq_k ] ) in ( [ eq_f ] ) and then in ( [ eq_f ] ) and ( [ eq_psi ] ) , we have for @xmath104    @xmath120 y_{l^{\\prime } } ( \\hat{r})\\ ] ]    and thus@xmath121 y_{l^{\\prime } } ( \\hat{r})~ ,   \\label{eq_psik}\\]]which is conform to the definition of the @xmath122 matrix .",
    "( [ eq_k ] ) gives a passage for the transformation @xmath123 .",
    "it is worth noting that the r - matrix depends on the radius but not the k - matrix ( nor the transmission matrix @xmath3 , or the scattering matrix @xmath124 ) .",
    "so once we have the r - matrix for any radius @xmath44 we can build the k - matrix using eq .  ( [ eq_k ] ) and inversely .",
    "the t - matrix is then obtained from the k - matrix using the well known relation : @xmath125",
