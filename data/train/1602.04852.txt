    "quantum entanglement is a particularly intriguing phenomenon  @xcite . since its conception in the famous epr paper  @xcite",
    ", it has received a great deal of interest . over the years",
    "both theoretical and experimental research was dedicated to its investigation  @xcite .    two distinct strategies are usually applied to quantum entanglement detection and quantification .",
    "the first approach to entanglement characterization is based on quantum state tomography and density matrix estimation  @xcite . knowing the state s density matrix , it is possible to apply various entanglement criteria and entanglement measures ( e.g. , the peres - horodecki citerion  @xcite ) . performing full state tomography is however a lengthy procedure since the number of required measurements grows exponentially with the dimension of hilbert space .",
    "the second strategy is based on so - called entanglement witnesses ( ew ) . measuring a simple linear ew",
    "involves performing suitable local measurements .",
    "their correlation across involved parties then reveals the entanglement [ e.g. clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) experiment @xcite ] .",
    "this strategy , however , requires some a priory information about the investigated state to properly choose the performed measurements .",
    "a revised version of this approach allows to estimate the amount of the available entanglement from the maximal amount of the chsh inequality violation  @xcite .",
    "one can describe entanglement using collective ( nonlinear ) entanglement witnesses  @xcite that depend on joint measurements on several copies of the entangled state . as demonstrated experimentally , e.g. , by bovio _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , it is possible to apply a specific two - copy witness to detect quantum entanglement . in this way one can also measure entanglement in terms of concurrence  @xcite ( related to the entanglement of formation ) or other two - copy witnesses  @xcite",
    "there is a number of other nonlinear entanglement witnesses and quantifiers that do not rely on quantum state tomography  @xcite .",
    "in particular , adaptive approach to two - qubit entanglement detection was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .     conceptual scheme for measuring the collectibility of polarization encoded two - qubit states with linear optics .",
    "two copies of a two - qubit state @xmath0 and @xmath1 are prepared .",
    "polarization of one the photons from each pair is measured locally . at the same time ,",
    "two different measurements on the other two photons are performed interchangeably : ( i ) simple unconditional detection ( balanced beam splitter bs is removed ) and ( ii ) two - photon bunching measurement corresponding to singlet state projection ( bs inserted ) .",
    "the resulting four - fold coincidences are registered and the collectibility is then calculated from these coincidences using the procedure described in the text . ]",
    "all the above mentioned approaches have their merits , but here we will focus on the proposal of rudnicki _ et al . _",
    "it makes use of suitable measurements performed simultaneously on two copies of the investigated quantum state ( see the conceptual scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] ) .",
    "this nonlinear entanglement witness is referred to as the _ collectibility _ , because values of the projections of the analyzed state onto the set of separable states are accumulated collectively . in a subsequent work ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have extended the notion of the collectibility to apply also to mixed states  @xcite and intorduced a collective nonlinear entanglement witness @xmath2 .",
    "this technique does not share the disadvantages of the previously mentioned methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , it allows to detect two - qubit entanglement for an arbitrary state and for pure states it allows to measure the amount of entanglement in terms of the negativity  @xcite , an entanglement measure corresponding to the entanglement cost under the positive partial transpose operations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the notion of the collectibility is based on the same principles as the entropic uncertainty relations , thus , its value can have a physical interpretation .",
    "however , a completely universal negativity measurement requires in general four copies of the two - qubit state  @xcite . in comparison to other previously proposed methods ,",
    "the collectibility requires only one two - photon interaction to be implemented .    to measure the colletibility of two - qubit systems",
    ", it is required to perform collective measurements on two copies of the state . on the platform of linear optics with qubits encoded as polarization states of individual photons ,",
    "these measurements include various local polarization projections combined with two - photon interference ( hong - ou - mandel effect @xcite ) .",
    "the set of performed measurements is state - independent and , thus , does not require any a priory knowledge .",
    "the use of local projections is an additional experimental benefit , because these can be simultaneously treated as heralds when using imperfect single - photon sources ( e.g. those based on spontaneous frequency down - conversion ) .    here",
    ", we demonstrate that the entire collectibility measurement procedure is experimentally feasible with current level of quantum optics technology .",
    "we test the rudnicki _",
    "@xcite method on three distinct two - photon quantum states ( one pure entangled , one pure separable and one maximally mixed ) .",
    "consequently , we compare the observed values of @xmath3 and their theoretical values .",
    "we demonstrate that all the measurements can be corrected for typical ( and unavoidable ) experimental shortcomings such as imperfect two - photon indistinguishability .",
    "the possibility to calibrate the measurement apparatus is an important prerequisite allowing this procedure to be used in realistic experimental conditions .",
    "we focus on two - qubit states @xmath4 .",
    "let us assume that qubit @xmath5 is projected onto @xmath6 or @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for a horizontally - polarized and vertically - polarized photon , respectively .",
    "these projections are set by the @xmath10 rotations marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] .",
    "the probability associated with these projections reads @xmath11 and the reduced state is described by the following single - qubit density matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the collectibility for two - qubit states @xcite can be calculated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are gramm matrix elements @xcite that depend on probabilities @xmath17 and two - photon overlaps @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these overlaps are measured by using the following identity @xmath20,$ ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a projector on polarization - encoded singlet state .",
    "this projection is implemented by overlapping photons @xmath23 and @xmath24 on a balanced beamsplitter and measuring the rate of anticoalescence of the photons transmitted through the beamsplitter .",
    "this technique is very useful in measuring quantum properties of microsopic systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "direct calculations reveal that the maximum of collectibility does not depend on the parameter @xmath25 , thus , we set @xmath26 @xcite . measuring the maximum value of @xmath27",
    "allows to both detect and quantify the entanglement of pure two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "however , for mixed states it is more convenient to apply a closely related collective witness @xmath3 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath28 where the gramm matrix elements are calculated for @xmath29 .",
    "this witness depends on conditional purity @xmath30 of a qubit @xmath31 , obtained after projecting its counterpart from subsystem @xmath5 onto @xmath32 the parameter @xmath33}$ ] depends on @xmath34|_{\\theta=0}$ ] and @xmath35|_{\\theta=\\pi/2}$ ] . measuring negative value of @xmath3",

    "we have constructed a four - photon source as depicted in fig .",

    "second harmonics generation ( shg ) is then used to convert the wavelength of these pulses to .",
    "typical mean power of the pumping beam at the output of shg is about .    in the next step ,",
    "the pumping beam is subjected to a polarization dispersion line ( pdl ) to correct for intrinsic polarization dispersion of the bbo crystals ( @xmath36-bab@xmath37o@xmath38 ) used to generate photon pairs .",
    "this dispersion line consists of two beam displacers and a half - wave plate placed in between .",
    "suitable tilt of these beam displacers allows to elongate optical path of one polarization with respect to the other .",
    "the laser beam then impinges on a bbo crystal cascade ( known as the kwiat source @xcite ) .",
    "type i spontaneous parametric down - conversion occurring in the first and second bbo crystal coherently generates pairs of horizontally and vertically polarized photons respectively . by adjusting the pumping beam polarization",
    ", one can tune the generation rate of horizontally and vertically polarized pairs as well as their mutual phase shift .",
    "the pumping beam then propagates through a quarter - wave plate , gets reflected on a mirror , goes again through that quarter - wave plate and impinges on the bbo crystal cascade on its way back towards the source . at this point a second pair of photons",
    "is generated .",
    "the quarter - wave plate is used to rotate the pumping beam polarization so that again it compensates for the polarization dispersion in bbo crystals ( now in reverse order ) .    using mirrors , pairs of photons generated by both the forward and backward propagating pumping beam",
    "are directed towards fiber couplers that lead them to single - photon detectors via single - mode optical fibers .",
    "these couplers are equipped with interference filters in case of photons 1 and 3 and by interference filters in case of photons 2 and 4 . before being collected by the fiber couplers , one photon from each pair ( photons 1 and 3 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) is subjected to polarization projection using a quarter - wave plate , a half - wave plate and a polarizing cube .",
    "the other two photons ( 2 and 4 ) are collected directly to single - mode fibers and then overlapped on a balanced fiber beam splitter ( fbs ) before led towards detectors .",
    "temporal two - photon overlap on this beam splitter is adjusted by suitable choice of a fiber delay line and a motorized translation stage positioning the pumping beam back - reflecting mirror .",
    "typical four - photon detection events occur about once per 5 minutes depending on the adjusted quantum state and polarization projection .",
