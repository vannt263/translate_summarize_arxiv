    "optimal allocation of wealth among portfolios in presence of transaction costs is a well known problem in literature  @xcite .",
    "the investment we consider in this paper is on a risk - less bank account paying a fixed interest rate and on a risky asset with the logarithmic price increments modeled by a wiener process .    the general approach to face this problem is to follow the asset price during all the time and sometimes `` control '' the portfolio buying or selling stocks .",
    "this approach leads to problems of _ singular _ control brownian motion ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) which seem the most adequate in this context . in an instantaneous control technique one",
    "has access ( in principle ) to the entire information ; i.e. the process is continuously observed , even between two changes of trader s portfolio .",
    "however , for all practical purposes , the necessary information is limited only to the moments the investor acts : therefore , we shall focus our attention only on these moments when something happens relevant from his point of view .",
    "a trading rule is given if , each time the investor changes his portfolio , one specifies :    * which fraction of his capital has to be invested in the risky asset , * when the investor should modify again his position ;    then among all possible strategies the investor is interested in the optimal one .",
    "following kelly  @xcite we consider an investor who desires to maximize the growth rate of his capital .",
    "it seems to be the most natural approach if the trader is interested only in the long run behavior of his capital : in the following this kind of investor will be called speculator .    in financial markets assets have a bid and ask price . in this case",
    "the asset value is no longer defined in a unique way : it can take on any value in the bid - ask spread . at every time one can buy assets at the ask price or sell them obtaining the bid price , which is always lower then the previous one . in this paper",
    "we shall consider this spread in asset price as the only source of trading costs .    the most common way to treat the portfolio optimization in presence of such costs  @xcite is to define an _",
    "absolute _ asset value depending on the bid and ask price . however in a financial strategy it is natural to introduce a value _ relative _ to speculator s behavior , i.e. an asset value which depends on the kind of operation ( ask or bid ) the market trader performs .",
    "the value is a matter of conventions : there are no financial reasons to prefer one choice or another .",
    "of course the optimal growth rate can not depend on the convention used .",
    "we shall show that this new point of view allows a mapping of the portfolio optimization problem to a similar one without costs .",
    "therefore it connects a _ singular _ control problem to information theory , with the main advantage that information _  la _ shannon  @xcite of an asset price can be measured on financial data and also computed in an elementary way for processes as the wiener one considered here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section * 2 * we state the portfolio selection problem .",
    "we summarize the case of absence of costs in a version appropriate for our purposes in section * 3*. in section * 4 * the _ relative _ value approach is treated : both the exact solution and an approximation of it are considered in detail and we discuss the relations and differences between the _ relative _ and _ absolute _ approach .",
    "finally section * 5 * is devoted to summarize the results . in appendix * a * we deduce the probabilities and average time to exit from a barrier in a wiener process and in appendix * b * we discuss the _ absolute _ value approach in an approximate case .",
    "we consider a speculator who diversifies his portfolio in a risk - less bank account with a deterministic rate of growth @xmath0 and a risky asset , for example a stock in a capital market .    the ask and bid prices of the stock s shares at calendar ( continuous ) time @xmath1",
    "are related by the following equation @xmath2 where we consider the transaction cost @xmath3 time independent .",
    "the return at calendar time @xmath1 is defined @xmath4    the speculator is interested to choose a strategy which maximizes the exponential growth rate of his capital @xmath5 @xmath6    in particular we shall consider the case where the trader modifies his position in the market only when a relevant change of the asset price appears .",
    "this point of view is natural in realistic situations where the trader waits until the return s variations are significant for him and then rebalances his portfolio .",
    "we call , as in  @xcite , @xmath7-trading time the rank of such an investment .    at @xmath7-trading time @xmath8 the speculator keeps a fraction @xmath9 of his capital in assets , while the remaining part is left in the bank account .",
    "we shall consider only self - financing strategies and we desire to repeat the game at every @xmath7-trading time : therefore we shall limit our analysis to the fraction @xmath9 such that the capital is always strictly greater than zero .",
    "the speculator waits until @xmath10 raises up to @xmath11 or decreases to @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) , where both barriers are fixed by the speculator at @xmath7-trading time @xmath8 . when the return  ( [ eq : return barrier ] ) `` hits '' one of the two barriers the speculator can buy or sell assets .",
    "we call exit time @xmath14 the lag between two portfolio changes .    to obtain a lighter notation",
    "we define the ( final ) _ state _ of the speculator @xmath15 , depending on the kind of operation ( ask / bid ) he will perform at @xmath7-trading time @xmath16 : @xmath17    the fraction of the capital in assets is @xmath18 just before the @xmath16-th trade and @xmath19 immediately after , where the random variable @xmath20 can assume the values @xmath21    in particular we shall consider the most natural investment @xmath22 i.e. buy at the lower price and sell at the higher , or equivalently the following condition must be satisfied @xmath23    in the proposed trading rule there are two classes of parameters , connected to the two main characteristics of a financial strategy , we have mentioned in the introduction :    * @xmath24 which specifies the fraction of the capital invested on assets , * @xmath25 which is connected to the time the speculator has to keep his position .",
    "we have split the optimal trading rule in the two main questions for a speculator ; we shall show that it will allow us to map the problem with transaction costs into one where no costs are present .",
    "if we limit our attention to the trading times we can rewrite the growth rate of the capital @xmath26 where we call @xmath27 the mean lyapunov exponent of the capital , @xmath28 is the number of investments ( or equivalently exits of the process ) up to the time @xmath1 and @xmath29 is the mean exit time .    in the case",
    "ergodic processes are considered , one can substitute the @xmath7-trading time average in equations  ( [ eq : lyapunov definition ] ) and ( [ eq : t definition ] ) with the expectation value of the associate process .",
    "we notice that this analysis , where the returns are considered only when they hit the barriers , resembles poincar maps in dynamical systems .",
    "going from continuous to discrete time setting , the quantities of dynamical interest are simply rescaled by the mean exit time @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the discrete time framework is clearly relevant in finance because it allows to show the connection of the capital growth rate , obtained via an optimal control policy , with quantities strictly related to shannon entropy  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage is that these quantities can be directly measured on a historical dataset of financial assets  @xcite or computed via elementary probability theory in simple cases .",
    "furthermore , analyzing transaction costs from an unusual point of view this new framework will allow us to map the problem into one without costs .",
    "this approach is directly connected to the way a financial decision is taken in practice .",
    "the speculator is interested in a growth rate which is optimal with respect to what has happened up to @xmath31 @xmath7-time steps before : it is an intuitive fact that events far in the past are irrelevant in the present portfolio selection . in other words",
    ", portfolio depends only on the last @xmath31 investments , i.e on a _ finite _ set of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the markovian order @xmath31 is chosen according to the `` memory '' of the asset process  @xcite .    in this paper we shall consider the no - memory case modeling the returns with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the drift and @xmath34 a wiener process with unitary variance .",
    "we can safely assume a null risk - free interest rate @xmath0 .",
    "the case @xmath35 can always be recovered by simply replacing @xmath33 with @xmath36 and adding @xmath0 to the growth rate of the capital  ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) .",
    "using the notation introduced above we summarize in this section the well known case of portfolio selection in absence of transaction costs .    the capital at @xmath7-trading time @xmath16 is given by @xmath37   w_k   \\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : process no costs}\\ ] ]    we are considering a `` scale invariant '' trader : maximizing the growth rate his behavior does not depend on the capital he has when he starts an investment  .",
    "in the case under consideration the return process has no memory and no transaction costs are involved .",
    "the speculator repeats then exactly the same game at every @xmath7-trading time .",
    "this implies that the optimal choice of both the fractions @xmath24 and of barriers @xmath25 do not depend on the considered time @xmath8 .",
    "the mean lyapunov exponent of the capital is @xmath38 +      ( 1-p ) \\ln \\left[1+l(\\exp(\\delta^+)-1)\\right ]   \\,\\ , .",

    "the capital growth rate as a function of the chosen strategy , is obtained dividing the mean lyapunov exponent  ( [ eq : lyapunov no costs ] ) by the average exit time @xmath40 .",
    "we have derived in the appendix the values of @xmath41 ( equation  ( [ eq : pi ] ) ) and @xmath42 ( equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) ) for the wiener process  ( [ eq : wiener ] ) .",
    "we shall look for the maximum capital growth rate finding first the optimal fraction @xmath43 at fixed barriers @xmath25 and then searching the optimal @xmath7s .",
    "the optimal @xmath43 satisfies @xmath44    substituting the optimal value of @xmath43  ( [ eq : l kelly ] ) in equation  ( [ eq : lyapunov no costs ] ) we can write the mean lyapunov exponent @xmath45 as the kullback entropy  @xcite between the probabilities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the martingale probability  ( [ eq : martingale ] ) . as pointed out by kelly  @xcite in a particular case , relation  ( [ eq : lyapunov kelly ] ) plays a central role in log - optimal portfolio selection : the growth rate obtained modifying the portfolio according to an optimal control strategy  @xcite is linked to the entropy of the underlying process in information theory  @xcite .",
    "speculator s capital growth rate in absence and , as we shall show , in presence of transaction costs depends on the information present in the asset price .",
    "such an information can be measured in financial series  @xcite using a technique inspired by the kolmogorov @xmath49-entropy",
    "@xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lyapunov no costs ] we have plotted the capital growth rate @xmath50 for the optimal choice of @xmath43 .",
    "we notice that it is a non increasing function of its arguments .",
    "the maximum is reached for @xmath51 , obtaining the well known result that the optimal policy is continuous .",
    "it is an intuitive result due to the fact that a change in the portfolio does not cost anything and then the best solution is to use this _ free _ opportunity to rebalance continuously the investment .",
    "we also observe that the maximum @xmath51 , is the only point where the gradient of the growth rate is zero .",
    "therefore , if the speculator prefers to change his position at finite @xmath7s , the error in the growth rate is small , i.e. of the second order in @xmath7 for small @xmath7 .    performing the limit @xmath52 in the equations  ( [ eq : l kelly],[eq : lyapunov kelly ] ) one obtains the optimal capital fraction @xmath53 and the optimal growth rate @xmath54    we shall not allow the trader to borrow money from a bank or short selling of stock .",
    "an optimal portfolio suggests to keep the same fraction for ever ( @xmath55 does not depend on @xmath8 ) and , because we are thinking to model a portfolio including shares as risky assets , a never - ending borrowing or short selling position does not appear realistic .",
    "the considered cases correspond to @xmath56 if this ratio is @xmath57 the best solution is to transfer all the money to the stock , instead the opposite limit corresponds to have no money in the risky asset . in the following",
    "we shall only consider transaction costs in the case with drift @xmath33 and variance @xmath58 which satisfy condition  ( [ eq : condition mu ] ) .",
    "in the portfolio selection in absence of costs there is a unique asset price .",
    "it is natural to associate the asset value to this price .",
    "the value is a way to quantify the amount of money the trader has in his risky assets : he diversifies his portfolio according to it , investing a fraction of his capital @xmath9 which depends on the asset value at @xmath7-trading time @xmath8 .",
    "if transaction costs are present the asset value is instead a convention .",
    "one obtains the bid price selling the asset and buys it at the ask price .",
    "the value can be any price between these two .    to define the asset value , two points of view seem natural :    * an absolute _ value _",
    "@xmath59 which is considered the `` true price '' , different from the ask and bid prices the trader finds in the market @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the transaction cost defined in  ( [ eq : price ] ) . * a value _ relative _ to the speculator s last trade : it is the bid price when he sells and the ask price when he buys .",
    "the point of view considered in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite and the references there in ) is the _ absolute _ value approach or one of the two parameters is kept equal to zero . ] . in this approach",
    "an asset is bought ( or sold ) at a price different from the value of an asset of the same kind already included in trader s portfolio .",
    "the absolute difference between the value and the price gives the cost . in the appendix * b * we summarize this approach in a approximate situation .",
    "we stress here that the _ absolute _ value is a pure convention .",
    "a financial asset is well defined only when a trader buys ( sells ) it ; its price is the ask ( bid ) price .",
    "it seems natural to associate the same `` wealth '' not only to the assets just traded but also to all the others present in his portfolio even before this transaction . in this way at every trading it exists only one value for the speculator .",
    "this sounds reasonable because there is no difference between the assets owned and the ones just bought ( sold ) .",
    "we are considering a value _ relative _ to the _ state _ of the speculator , as it as been defined in section * 2*.    a consequence of a _ relative _ value is that one has four possibilities depending on an the kind of investment ( ask / bid ) the speculator is performing at @xmath7-trading time @xmath8 ( initial _ state _",
    "@xmath62 ) and he will perform at @xmath16 ( final _ state _",
    "@xmath15 ) depending on which barrier the return  ( [ eq : return barrier ] ) will hit . to underline this fact",
    "we shall denote the barriers not only with the @xmath7-trading time of the operation but also with the initial and final _",
    "state_.    we remind that the bid and ask price are linked by relation  ( [ eq : price ] ) and that the trader buys at the lower price and sells at the higher ( see relations  ( [ eq : stato barriera ] ) ) .",
    "the evolution of the capital invested in assets between time @xmath8 and @xmath16 is then : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , i.e. one should at least wait a time long enough to pay the costs !    we are considering the simple case of a no - memory process .",
    "the only piece of information the speculator has to remember of his past is whether at the previous @xmath7-time step he has bought or sold assets , i.e. his initial _ state _ @xmath62 .",
    "so , the barriers @xmath65 can only depend on the initial and final _ states _ and the fraction @xmath9 only on the initial _ state _ , i.e when the @xmath66 investment is decided .    to obtain a lighter notation",
    "we introduce @xmath67    the capital at @xmath7-trading time @xmath16 is @xmath68 w_k        \\equiv   \\omega_{\\xi \\eta } w_k \\,\\ , , \\label{eq : relative process}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 has been defined in section * 2 * as the sign of the return between @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "the problem is then completely defined by a markovian transition matrix between the initial and final _ state _",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath70    the probabilities of the _ states _ @xmath71 and @xmath72 satisfy the following relation @xmath73    we have mapped the original portfolio selection into one where no costs are present but a markovian memory must be considered . the capital growth rate for a speculator who follows",

    "@xmath62 of the trader : @xmath75    let us comment equation  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative ] ) , which is the core of the paper .",
    "the selection of the optimal trading rule from the prospective of the _ relative _ value has led us to reduce our task to an optimization problem with a stochastic return driven by a finite - state markovian chain .",
    "the problem can be then faced with elementary probability theory in discrete spaces !    in the following",
    "we shall find the solution for @xmath76 and @xmath77 which optimize the growth rate  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative ] ) .",
    "we consider then an ansatz , with @xmath43 and @xmath78 independent from the initial _ state _ , which appears quite natural in the case of absence of memory for the underlying process , we are dealing with in this paper .",
    "we discuss in detail this approximation underlining why it can be relevant for practical purposes and compare the results with the _ absolute _ value approach .",
    "we have shown how the portfolio selection in presence of transaction costs has been mapped into a markovian problem in absence of costs .",
    "we find here the optimal solution following the same route of previous section maximizing first @xmath79 and then finding the optimal barriers .",
    "the two optimal values of @xmath43 are @xmath80 substituting @xmath81 and @xmath82 in  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative ] ) one obtains @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath85    we notice that the numerator of equation  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative solution ] ) is for a markov chain the quantity equivalent to the kullback entropy of equation  ( [ eq : lyapunov kelly ] ) , obtained in the no memory case : this is the _ available _ information introduced in a simpler case by  @xcite .",
    "let us stress that , for fixed barriers @xmath77 , the optimal growth rate of speculator s capital is linked to the shannon entropy of the underlying process and then in general to a measurable quantity even if transaction costs are present .",
    "the speculator tries then to select the barriers @xmath7 that maximize the information per unit of time  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative solution ] ) associated to the process .",
    "we observe in equations  ( [ eq : cases ] ) that the trader pays costs only when he changes his _ state _ : every modification of his portfolio still remaining in the same _ state _ costs nothing .",
    "of course he will use this _ free _ opportunity to rebalance his portfolio as often as he can , i.e @xmath86    in this case the growth rate of the capital becomes : @xmath87 where @xmath88 we notice that even in this case the growth rate  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative zero ] ) is a non increasing function of its arguments .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : soluzione barriera ] ) gives the optimal choice for the barriers of the portfolio selection problem in presence of transaction costs , because the growth rate  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative zero ] ) is a non increasing function of the two barriers .    in figure",

    "we have considered only the positive values because @xmath7 is an even function of @xmath33 .",
    "one can also show that @xmath101 is the only point where the gradient of the growth rate  ( [ eq : lyapunov relative solution ] ) is the null vector .",
    "this fact is particularly relevant for a speculator , because the optimal solution , as a consequence of  ( [ eq : delta limite zero ] ) , requires on average to rebalance the portfolio after a time equal to zero .",

    "we have considered in this paper a new point of view to treat the transaction costs problem .",
    "this approach focuses only on the times the trader modifies his position . in the diversification of his portfolio the asset value ( of all assets ! ) depends on the trade ( bid or ask ) he is performing and then it is _ relative _ to the market operator .",
    "this approach presents several advantages compared with the `` traditional '' convention of the _ absolute _ value .",
    "the portfolio selection has been transformed to a markovian problem in absence of costs .",
    "we have connected the quantities of interest ( growth rate and optimal portfolio strategy ) to the average exit times and probabilities to reach a barrier . if the returns can be modeled by a wiener process , as assumed in this paper , both quantities",
    "can be computed using elementary probability theory , allowing to have analytic formulas for both the strategy ( @xmath43 and @xmath7s ) and capital growth rate of the optimal solution .",
    "more generally , however , the same technique can be easily extended to all the utilities in the hara class and this approach allows a straightforward generalization to the case with memory ; it is then particularly relevant in the case of a real market , where exit times and probabilities to reach a barrier can be measured directly from a historical dataset  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the exact solution of the problem in presence of transaction costs breaks the time invariance of the investment .",
    "however such a strategy is not feasible in practice because the speculator should modify his portfolio after a time which is on average zero . in subsection * 4.2 * we have considered a suboptimal strategy feasible for a speculator who wants to use it .",
    "this strategy , where the broken symmetry is restored , shows small differences in the capital growth rate with respect to the optimal one and involves only a finite number of transactions in finite time .",
    "we want to stress here that in real markets the variation of the returns are discrete and of the same order of magnitude as the transaction cost @xmath3 . to extend this approach to this more realistic case",
    "is enough to consider the probability and the average time to exit from the barriers in the discrete case shown in appendix * a*.    even in the case the costs to transact are included , the selection of a log - optimal portfolio depends on the information _  la _ shannon of the asset price : in the general case this quantity can be measured on real data and it can be computed analytically if an elementary model for the returns is assumed . the wiener process can be considered a toy model for asset returns , nevertheless for a speculator who waits until relevant changes in the returns appear , this model catches the essential features of the portfolio selection , leading to a deeper understanding of the role of approximate but feasible strategies .",
    "we thank markus abel for a careful reading of the manuscript , massimo cencini for an enlightening conversation about markovian processes , filippo cesi for a nice discussion on exit times in wiener processes , michele pasquini , maurizio serva and davide vergni for several comments and suggestions on the subject , angelo vulpiani for a huge number of discussions about kelly s strategies and my father for a never - ending encouragement during all this work .",
