    "wideband beamforming has been studied extensively in the past @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in order to avoid the spatial aliasing problem for uniform linear arrays ( ulas ) , the adjacent sensor spacing has to be less than half of the minimum operating wavelength corresponding to the highest frequency of the signal of interest . on the other hand ,",
    "sparse arrays allow adjacent sensor separations greater than half a wavelength while still avoiding grating lobes due to the randomness of sensor locations  @xcite .",
    "however , the unpredictable sidelobe behaviour associated with sparse arrays means some optimisation of sensor locations is required to reach an acceptable performance level .",
    "various nonlinear methods have been used to achieve this required optimisation .",
    "for example , genetic algorithms ( gas ) @xcite and simulated annealing ( sa ) @xcite have been regularly used .",
    "the disadvantage of these types of methods are the potentially extremely long computation times and the possibility of convergence to a non - optimal solution .",
    "recently , the area of compressive sensing ( cs ) has been explored @xcite , and cs - based methods have been proposed in the design of narrowband sparse arrays @xcite .",
    "further work has also shown that it is possible to improve the sparseness of a solution by considering a reweighted @xmath1 minimisation problem @xcite .",
    "the aim of these methods is to bring the minimisation of the @xmath1 norm of the weight coefficients closer to that of the minimisataion of the @xmath2 norm .",
    "however , for a wideband array to be sparse , all coefficients along the tapped delay - lines ( tdls ) associated with an individual sensor have to be equal or very close to zero .",
    "therefore , it is not sufficient to simply minimize the @xmath1 norm of the weight coefficients . instead",
    ", a method similar to the technique employed in complex - valued @xmath0 norm minimization  @xcite , is presented in this paper , which can be considered as an expanded version of the idea in @xcite . as in the case with narrowband array design ,",
    "it is possible to use a reweighted scheme for the wideband method as well .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",

    "a general linear array structure for wideband beamforming with a tdl length j is shown in fig .",

    "as previously mentioned , cs has been employed in the design of sparse narrowband arrays by trying to match the array s response to a desired / reference one , @xmath20 . extending the design to the wideband case , we first consider fig .",
    "[ fig : as ] as being a grid of potential active sensor locations . in this instance",
    ", @xmath21 is the maximum aperture of the array and the values of @xmath7 , for @xmath22 , are selected to give a uniform grid , with @xmath23 being a large enough number to cover all potential locations of the sensors .",
    "sparseness is then introduced by selecting the set of weight coefficients to give as few active locations as possible , while still giving a designed response that is close to the desired one .    in the first instance , this problem could be formulated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of nonzero weight coefficients in @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the vector holding the desired beam response at sampled frequency points @xmath28 and angle @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the matrix composed of the steering vectors at the corresponding frequency @xmath28 and angle @xmath29 , and @xmath33 places a limit on the allowed difference between the desired and the designed responses . in the constraint in ( [ eq : min0 ] ) @xmath34 denotes the @xmath35 norm .    in detail , @xmath27 and @xmath32",
    "are respectively given by @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the desired response @xmath20 can be obtained from that of a traditional uniform linear array , or simply assumed to be an ideal response ( i.e. one at the mainlobe area and zero for the sidelobe area ) and this is adopted in what follows .    in practice",
    ", the cost function in ( [ eq : min0 ] ) will be replaced by the @xmath1 norm ,",
    "@xmath38    the above formulation is effective in the design of narrowband arrays , where the tdl length @xmath39 ( i.e. each sensor has only one weight coefficient attached ) and the number of nonzero coefficients will be the same as the number of active sensors . in other words , any coefficient with a zero value will mean that the associated sensor is inactive .",
    "however , in the wideband case , to guarantee a sparse solution , the weight coefficients along a tdl have to be simultaneously minimized .",
    "when all coefficients along a tdl are zero - valued , we can then consider the corresponding location to be inactive and sparsity is introduced . to achieve this , similar to the technique used in complex - valued @xmath0 norm minimization  @xcite ,",

    "for example , we can add the response variation constraint @xmath56 derived in @xcite to design a sparse wideband array with frequency invariant beam response @xcite , where the matrix @xmath57 and the threshold value @xmath58 are formulated to make sure the change of response of the resultant beamformer with respect to different frequencies is limited to an acceptable level .",
