    "the second forcing is the stochastic forcing used in @xcite , where the fourier coefficients of @xmath36 are chosen randomly , and we refer to the data produces with this forcing as the stochastic dataset .",
    "both forcings have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the deterministic forcing equilibrates quickly and has less variance in time so that less data is needed for converged time averages .",
    "but there is an unavoidable anisotropy throughout the simulation if the forcing is restricted to the lowest wave numbers .",

    "this forcing simply relaxes the amplitudes of the fourier coefficients in the first two wave numbers so that the energy matches the target spectrum @xmath46 in those wave numbers .",
    "it has no effect on the phase of the coefficients .",

    "we approximate the spherically averaged third - order longitudinal structure function by the following average over a finite number @xmath59 of directions : @xmath60 ^ 3.\\ ] ] where @xmath61 denotes grid - points , @xmath62 denotes the increment vector in the @xmath63th direction , @xmath64 is fixed , and the @xmath65 are quadrature weights .",
    "here we are using the longitudinal structure function as an example .",
    "the procedure applies equally well to any two - point structure function .",

    ". the most straightforward approach would be to perform 3-dimensional interpolations at each of the points @xmath66 .",
    "this requires @xmath67 3-d interpolations of the velocity - vector field for each separation distance @xmath2 , which is prohibitively expensive @xcite .",

    "[ directions ] .    in the figure , points represent structure function values at the separation distances @xmath81 , and each line is a cubic - spline fit to the data at @xmath82 along each of the @xmath59 directions .",
    "one can see that only a few directions are computed at each of the separation distances , so we can not directly take an angle - average from this data .",
    "but one can also see that the curves are quite smooth and the cubic - spline is an excellent interpolant .",
    "thus we use cubic - spline interpolation to calculate the structure function in each of the @xmath59 directions , at separation vector @xmath83 of any desired length @xmath2 .",
    "once the data for each direction has been interpolated to a common separation distance @xmath2 , we can approximate the angle - average at @xmath2 by quadrature over the @xmath59 directions : @xmath84 in order to determine the quadrature weights @xmath65 , we use the software package stripack @xcite to compute the voronoi tiling generated by the points @xmath85 on the unit sphere centered at @xmath15 .",
    "the weight @xmath65 is the solid angle subtended by the voronoi cell containing the point @xmath85 .",
    "the angle - averaging procedure described can be implemented efficiently on parallel computers , requiring only the same type of parallel data transpose operator already used by a parallel pseudo - spectral code .",
    "the total cost of this angle - averaging procedure for one snapshot ( 73 directions and 100 different separation distances ) is about the same as 150 timesteps of the navier - stokes code .",
    "thus for a single eddy turnover time , where thousands of timesteps are required , the angle - averaging statistics can be computed during the computation with minimal impact on the total cpu time requirement .",
    "we first present results demonstrating how well the angle - average procedure performs at extracting the isotropic component from our dns data .",
    "we again follow @xcite and examine the relations between the second and third order velocity structure functions : @xmath86 these equations require only isotropy and incompressibility . thus in dns data , where incompressibility is obtained to numerical round off error ,",
    "deviations in the above relations are a measure of the anisotropy in the data . in @xcite , the left and right sides of these equations",
    "are plotted after averaging in time .",
    "excellent agreement is obtained in the inertial range , with some departure at larger scales .    in fig .",
    "[ isocheck2 ] , we show the second order isotropy relation for our stochastic dataset , and in fig .",
    "[ isocheck3 ] we show the third order relation for the deterministic dataset .",
    "this data is computed by angle - averaging over a single snapshot of the flow .",
    "the agreement is excellent , both in the inertial range and at the largest scales . for comparison",
    ", the figures also show the same relations from the same snapshot but using only a single coordinate direction instead of angle - averaging . in that case",
    ", there are significant differences for scales well into the inertial range .",
    "thus the angle - averaging technique appears to be extremely effective in extracting the isotropic component of anisotropic data , even at large scales where anisotropy remains after time averaging over many snapshots .",
    "similar results were obtained for the second order isotropy relation from the deterministic dataset and for the third order isotropy relation from the stochastic dataset .",
    "we now present results from using angle - averaging to compute the third - order longitudinal structure function in the 4/5ths law .",
    "figures [ sto_snapshot ] and [ det_snapshot ] show the result of the angle - averaging procedure described above for single snapshots of the stochastic and deterministic datasets respectively .",
    "the snapshots are taken after the flow has had time to equilibrate .",
    "the value of the mean energy dissipation rate @xmath6 was calculated from the snapshot .",
    "this is to be contrasted with previous works in which @xmath6 is a long - time or ensemble average .",
    "we have therefore computed a version of the 4/5ths relation which is local in time .",
    "the dots represent the data from all 73 directions at all values of @xmath2 that were computed . the final weighted angle - average of eq .",
    "( [ angave ] ) is given by the thick curves in both figs .",
    "[ sto_snapshot ] and [ det_snapshot ] .",
    "one can see that the results from different directions are quite different , while the angle - averaged results are quite reasonable and similar to each other as well as similar to the results obtained from long time averaging of the coordinate directions presented in @xcite and shown for our data in section [ tresults ] .",
    "thus we conclude that angle - averaging the data from a single snapshot yields a very reasonable result .",
    "similar results ( not plotted ) are obtained for the 4/3rds and 4/15ths laws .      to illustrate the variance in time of the third - order longitudinal structure function , with and without angle - averaging , we plot the peak value as a function of time for each dataset in figures [ timeseries ] and [ timeseries_sto ] .",
    "the solid line is the angle - averaged value , and the dashed line is the value from a single coordinate direction .",
    "the angle - averaged value has a significantly reduced variance as compared to the single direction value , but one can see that there still is some variance from snapshot to snapshot .",
    "thus in order to obtained fully converged statistics , some additional averaging is needed . in the next section we present results combining angle and time averaging .",
    "based on the local version of the k@xmath12 laws proved in @xcite , we expect that increasing the spatial resolution would allow us to obtain converged statistics from a single snapshot when used with angle - averaging .",
    "however , we could not expect such convergence without angle - averaging .",
    "this is because even in an isotropic flow , individual snapshots are not necessary isotropic - only the ensemble of all snapshots is guaranteed to be isotropic .",
    "we note that the stochastic dataset ( fig .",
    "[ timeseries_sto ] ) shows a larger variation from snapshot to snapshot when compared to the deterministic dataset ( fig .",
    "[ timeseries ] ) .",
    "this is true for both the angle - averaged and single direction quantities shown in the figures , suggesting that the stochastic dataset produces data with a slightly larger variance in time , as expected .",
    "we now look at the 4/5ths law using both angle - averaging ( which extracts the isotropic component of the statistics ) and time - averaging ( to remove the variance observed from snapshot to snapshot ) .",
    "the time - average is taken from 60 snapshots taken over 6 eddy turnover times .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ angle - time_comp ] .",
    "the two datasets produce nearly identical results at all scales , even though the large scale forcing is quite different .",
    "the peak value of the stochastic and deterministic datasets are .755 and .752 , respectively .",
    "thus we conclude that flows with similar geometry and reynolds number have the same underlying isotropic component at all scales , at least up to third order statistics .",
    "we have proposed a new , computationally efficient and easily implemented means of extracting isotropic statistics from an arbitrarily forced flow .",
    "as a first test of the method , we averaged the third - order structure functions over sufficiently many angles and discovered that the k@xmath12 relations are obtained , with tolerable variance , from a @xmath87 snapshot of homogeneous flow with either stochastic or deterministic forcing .",
    "this is a stronger result than was predicted by the original kolmogorov ensemble approach or even the nie - tanveer version of @xcite .",
    "it appears that the results are , in fact , approaching the @xmath88 versions of k@xmath12 proposed in @xcite .    using our procedure to extract the isotropic component",
    ", we are able to separate the effect of anisotropy from the effect of finite - reynolds number on the statistics of the flow .",
    "this is an important point to make in the debate on how the two effects contaminate the inertial range .",
    "once the anisotropy is eliminated , a more fruitful study of finite - reynolds number effects can be made .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ angle - time_comp ] that the reynolds numbers are still not sufficient to give the wide inertial ranges that have been seen in high - reynolds number experiments .",
    "however , it is also clear that angle - averaging has given a significant improvement in the results . with angle - averaging",
    ", less data is needed to obtain converged statistics , and deterministic forcings can be used without regard to the increased anisotropy they introduce .",
    "the procedure we have described above can be used to investigate the isotropic component of higher - order structure functions or any other statistic as well .",
    "for example , the angle - averaged @xmath89th - order longitudinal structure functions may be measured in this way in order to determine scaling exponents which are truly independent of anisotropy .",
    "this method may also be used to isolate the anisotropic contributions themselves , as has been done in @xcite , by subtracting from the full structure function its angle - averaged value .",
    "individual moments in a spherical harmonics expansion of structure functions can be computed by introducing the basis function of interest to the integrand in equation [ angave ] . in this way ,",
