    "phase transition and critical phenomenon are extensively debatable subjects in the natural sciences .",
    "recently , the same concept was introduced into the astronomical objects @xcite as well as the microscopic systems , such as in atomic cluster @xcite and nuclei @xcite .",
    "nucleus is a finite - size droplet - like quantum system in the ground state , it may experience the liquid - gas phase transition or critical behavior when the nucleus is heated . till date",
    ", various experimental evidences have been accumulated to corroborate the nuclear liquid gas phase transition or critical behavior .",
    "for instance , violent heavy - ion collisions break the nuclei into several intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) instantaneously @xcite , which might be viewed as a critical phenomenon as observed in fluid , atomic and other systems .",
    "the sudden opening of the nuclear multifragmentation and vaporization @xcite channels can be interpreted as the signature of the boundaries of phase mixture .",
    "in addition , temperature plateau of the nuclear caloric curve @xcite in a certain excitation energy range gives a possible indication of phase transition @xcite . on the other hand , the extraction of critical exponents in the charge or mass distribution of the multifragmentation system @xcite points to the continuous phase transition .",
    "more recently , the negative microcanonical heat capacity was experimentally attempted in nuclear fragmentation @xcite which may relate to the liquid - gas phase transition @xcite , and in atomic cluster @xcite which relates to solid - liquid phase transition @xcite , respectively . moreover , the evidence of spinodal decomposition in nuclear multifragmentation was recently reported experimentally @xcite , which may show the presence of liquid - gas phase coexistence region in the finite nuclear systems .",
    "bimodal distributions of some chosen variables measured in nuclear collisions were recently proposed as a signature of a first order phase transition in nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-scaling of the largest fragments was also investigated recently and it is probably a probe to detect the phase change @xcite . the nuclear zipf s law was proposed to diagnose the onset of liquid - gas phase transition or critical behavior @xcite and it is experimentally supported @xcite .",
    "phase coexistence diagram was also tentatively constructed based on the eos data @xcite .    while , extensive theoretical models have been developed to treat such a phase transition in the nuclear disassembly , e.g. percolation model , lattice gas model , statistical multifragmentation model and molecular dynamics model etc ( e.g. see some recent articles @xcite and references therein ) .    in this article which dedicates to prof fu - jia yang on the occasion of his 70th birthday ,",
    "i will focus on some experimental aspects of the nuclear lgpt or critical behavior in heavy ion collisions , specially for nimrod data .",
    "the fisher droplet model has been extensively applied to the analysis of multifragmentation since the pioneering experiments on high energy proton - nucleus collisions by the purdue group @xcite .",
    "relative yields of fragments with @xmath1 could be well described by a power law dependence @xmath2 and it was suggested that this might reflect the disassembly of a system whose excitation energy was comparable to its total binding energy @xcite .",
    "the extracted value of power - law exponent was @xmath3 , which is in a reasonable range for critical behavior @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach suggested that the multi - fragmentation of nuclei might be analogous to a continuous phase transition from liquid to gas which is observed in more common fluids .    in the fisher droplet model",
