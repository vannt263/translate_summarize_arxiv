    "coalescing black - hole binaries are among the most promising sources for the current and future laser - interferometer gravitational - wave detectors such as ligo / virgo@xcite and lisa  @xcite .    in general relativity , black holes are defined only by their masses and spins ; thus generically , a black - hole binary depends on eight parameters @xmath2 .",

    "however , since we start with an approximate hamiltonian that reproduces the spin - orbit couplings only through 2.5pn order , we expect the eob model to depend on the choice of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "considering the structure of the gyro - gravitomagnetic ratios , such dependence should start at 3.5pn order as a spin - orbit coupling term .",

    "the remaining flexibility of the spin eob model can be exploited in the future when numerical relativity simulations of other spin configurations will become available .",

    "it is worth mentioning that if we were using only the  kerr \" part of the spin eob hamiltonian , i.e. we ignore @xmath123 , then we do find a maximum of the orbital frequency and its value is quite close to the light ring position .",
    "a more detailed study has revealed that the absence of the maximum of the orbital frequency for the full spin eob hamiltonian is due to the spin - orbit coupling term @xmath123 defined in eq .  , which as discussed above does not reduce to the test - particle limit prediction at pn orders higher than 2.5pn . in the improved spin eob hamiltonian",
