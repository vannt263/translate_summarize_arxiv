    "is considered and the pair breaking and the scattering on the interface are ignored .",
    "we believe that under these strong assumptions our results describe the real situation qualitatively . in the framework of such model , the analytical expressions for the charge and spin current can be obtained for an arbitrary form of the order parameter .",

    "because in our green function ( [ spin - term ] ) , the spin current is proportional to the `` cross product '' between the left and right gap vectors .",
    "for instance , the spin current for the case of the axial state ( [ axial ] ) and geometry ( i ) is zero , because both of the gap vectors are in the same direction ( @xmath79 ) .",

    "namely , it is impossible to observe the tangential and perpendicular components of the currents at the same time for planar state with geometry ( ii)(figs.[fig6]-[fig9 ] ) .",

    "furthermore , it is observed that the different models of the gap vectors and geometries can be applied to the polarization of the spin transport .",
    "another result of these calculations is the state in which the currents select one of the two possible directions ( perpendicular and parallel to the interface ) to flow .",
    "this property can be used as a switch to control the direction of the charge and spin current .",
    "finally , as an interesting and new result , it is observed that at some certain values of the phase difference @xmath39 , the charge - current vanishes while the spin - current flows , although the carriers of both spin and charge are the same ( electrons ) .",
    "the spatial variation of the phase of the order parameter plays a role as the origin of the charge current and , similarly , due to the broken @xmath96 symmetry , a spatial difference of the gap vectors in two half - spaces causes spin currents .",
    "this is because there is a position - dependent phase difference between `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' cooper pairs and , although the total charge current vanishes , there can be a net transfer of the spin .",
    "therefore , in our system , there is a discontinuous jump between the gap vectors and , consequently the spin currents should generally be present .",
    "for instance , if up - spin states  and down - spin states have a velocity in the opposite direction , the charge currents cancel each other whereas the spin current is being transported . mathematically speaking , @xmath97",
    ", so it is possible to find the state in which one of these current terms is zero and the other term has the finite value@xcite .",
    "in addition the spin imbalance which is the result of the different density of states for `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' can be the other reason of spin current@xcite . in conclusion",
    ", the spin current in the absence of the charge current can be observed ."
