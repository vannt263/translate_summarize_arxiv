    "water fountains are evolved asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and young post - agb stars that show water maser emission with velocity separations in their spectral features @xmath7100  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "some of them have been observed with radio interferometric techniques and all show bipolar distributions of their h@xmath3o maser emission , indicating the presence of jets with extremely short dynamical ages of 5 - 100 yr @xcite .",
    "oh maser emission has been detected in most sources catalogued as water fountains and , in general , this emission exhibits lower velocities and is spatially less extended than that of h@xmath3o ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "water fountains are evolutionarily located between two phases of stellar evolution , agb stars and planetary nebulae ( pne ) , when mass - loss properties , among others , change dramatically . while mass ejection during the agb phase is spherical , most pne exhibit elliptical , bipolar , or multipolar morphologies .",
    "these morphologies have been attributed to the action of collimated outflows on the previously expelled spherical agb shell @xcite . therefore , water fountains very probably trace the onset of non - spherical and highly collimated mass ejection . understanding the transformation of an agb star into a pn relies on a precise knowledge of the properties and evolution of water fountains . unfortunately",
    ", very few water fountains are known at present ( 11 sources reported as of march 2008 , see @xcite ) , so that adding new members to this important class of objects represents a valuable progress .",
    "recently , in a single - dish search for h@xmath3o masers in evolved stars , @xcite found water maser emission toward iras16552@xmath83050 ( hereafter iras16552 ) , with a maximum separation among its velocity components of @xmath9170  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "iras16552 was first proposed to be a candidate post - agb star by @xcite , based on its iras colors .",
    "a possible optical counterpart of the iras far - infrared source was classified by @xcite and @xcite as a star of spectral type k9iii and k0i , respectively .    in this paper , we present very large array ( vla ) observations , carried out to confirm the association of this high - velocity water maser emission with the iras source , and to determine the spatial distribution of the masers .",
    "our results allow us to include iras16552 as a bona fide member of the water fountain class . in sec .",
    "[ obs ] we describe the performed observations . sec .",
    "[ results ] presents the obtained results , and sec .",
    "[ discussion ] a discussion on the properties of iras16552 and a comparison of this source with other water fountains . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "we have observed the @xmath10 maser transition of the water molecule ( rest frequency @xmath11 mhz ) using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) in two separate epochs . in the first one ( 2006 march 22 and 26 ) , we used the a configuration of the vla , and observed the right circular polarization ( 1 if mode ) over a bandwidth of 3.11 mhz sampled with 255 channels ( thus providing a spectral resolution of 1.22 khz , or 0.16 km  s@xmath1 ) . to be able to cover the whole range of the water maser emission detected by @xcite toward iras16552 ,",
    "we successively centered the bandwidth at six different velocities with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 km  s@xmath1 on 2006 march 22 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km  s@xmath1 on 2006 march 26 . therefore , we covered the water maser emission of iras16552 on a velocity range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 km  s@xmath1 ( although not simultaneously ) . the phase center for these observations was set at r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath20 , dec.(j2000 ) = @xmath21 , which is within @xmath22 from the position of the source given in @xcite .    in the second epoch , carried out on 2007 december 24 , we used the b configuration of the vla and the 4 if mode , with a bandwidth of 3.08 mhz sampled with 63 channels for each if ( 48.83 khz , or 0.7 km s@xmath1 spectral resolution ) .",
    "two ifs were used to observe right and left circular polarizations ( rcp and lcp ) centering the bandwidth at @xmath23 km  s@xmath1 , while the other two ifs ( rcp and lcp ) were centered at @xmath24 km  s@xmath1 . based on the results of the first epoch , we set the phase center of these observations at r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath25 , dec.(j2000 ) = @xmath26 , to include",
    "all observed maser components within @xmath22 from this center .    for both epochs , source j1331",
    "+ 305 was used as the flux calibrator ( assumed flux density @xmath27 jy ) , j1229 + 090 was the bandpass calibrator ( bootstrapped flux density @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 jy on 2006 march 22 , 2006 march 26 , and 2007 december 24 , respectively ) , while j1626 - 298 was the phase calibrator ( bootstrapped flux density @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 jy on 2006 march 22 , 2006 march 26 , and 2007 december 24 , respectively ) .",
    "maps were obtained with robust weighting of visibilities ( robust parameter = 0 ) and deconvolved using the clean algorithm .",
    "the resulting synthesized beams were @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the first ( a configuration ) and second ( b configuration ) epochs , respectively , with their major axes oriented nearly north - south .",
    "data were self - calibrated using a strong maser feature , and applying the obtained phase and amplitude correction to the rest of the channels for each data set . in the first epoch , the maser components detected in each day ( 2006 march 22 and 26 , i.e. , blue and redshifted emission , respectively ) could be aligned to a common reference position , using spectral features that were present in the overlapping region between each individual observation .",
    "however , the data taken in different days could not be aligned since there was no common spectral feature in the velocity ranges covered .",
    "therefore , the 2@xmath36 relative positional uncertainty between the maser features observed on the same day in the first epoch is @xmath37 ( estimated as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the size of the primary beam and snr is the signal to noise ratio ) , while the positional uncertainty among the emission observed in different days is @xmath40 . for the second epoch ,",
    "since all data were taken simultaneously , the self - calibration corrections obtained for the strongest maser feature was applied to all channels .",
    "the relative positional accuracy among all features in that second epoch was @xmath41",
    "the spectrum and the spatial distribution of the water maser components obtained on the first epoch are shown in fig .",
    "[ ini ] . by `` maser components '' we mean individual intensity peaks in the spectrum .",
    "the positional information has been obtained by fitting elliptical gaussians to the maser emission , only in the channels in which a spectral peak is present .",
    "the total velocity span of the maser emission is @xmath42170  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "two groups of components are evident in the spectrum : the redshifted group , from 50 to 110  km  s@xmath1 , and the blueshifted one , from @xmath840 to @xmath880  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the red components are more numerous and more intense than the blue ones , with the most intense peak reaching @xmath43  jy . the two groups appear spatially separated by @xmath44 , forming a bipolar distribution , with the red components clustered at the ne and the blue components clustered at the sw . however , as explained in sec .",
    "[ obs ] , while the spatial distribution of components within either group is very reliable ( relative positional errors @xmath45 ) , the relative position between both groups has an error of @xmath40 ( since they were observed in different days ) , which is on the order of the apparent separation .",
    "therefore , the bipolar distribution of the maser emission observed in the first epoch may not have been real .    fig .",
    "[ dec07 ] shows the spectrum and the spatial distribution of the water maser emission obtained in the second epoch .",
    "these observations did not cover the whole velocity range in which emission is present .",
    "they were set up to simultaneously observe red- and blueshifted components , in order to confirm the bipolarity . in these data ,",
    "the ne - sw bipolar distribution is present , with a separation of @xmath2 between the centroids of the red and blue groups along position angle ( pa ) @xmath46 .",
    "the separation and pa are both more reliable for this second epoch ( relative position error between features @xmath47 ) , although the internal distribution of the components in either group is more accurate in the first epoch . therefore , water maser emission from iras16552 seems to trace a bipolar outflow with a projected size of @xmath2 , and velocity along the line of sight of @xmath48 km  s@xmath1 ( half of the total velocity span ) .",
    "our results confirm iras16552 as a water fountain with a bipolar distribution of its water maser emission .",
    "it also confirms the trend of bipolarity in all water fountains studied up to now at high angular resolution with radio interferometry , strongly suggesting that water masers in all water fountains are produced in collimated , bipolar jets .",
    "the centroid position of the individual water maser components has absolute coordinates r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath49 , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath50 ( absolute position error @xmath40 , compatible in both epochs ) . assuming a bipolar configuration for the jet , we expect the powering source to be located near that position . however , this centroid is @xmath51 away from the post - agb star identified at optical wavelengths by @xcite , indicating that the water maser emission is associated with a different evolved star within the field .",
    "note that there is an error in the possition given in table 3 of @xcite , since this position does not correspond to the k0i star marked in the identification chart and whose spectrum is shown in that paper , but to a nearby source ( 2mass j16582776 - 3055062 ) .",
    "the true coordinates for the k0i star identified in @xcite are r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath52 , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath53 .",
    "we have searched the dss plates and the 2mass catalog for an optical and/or near ir counterpart at the position of the outflow source , but although several optical and near - ir sources lie within the iras ellipse error , none of them is coincident with the position of the maser emission .",
    "the closest 2mass source , j16582725 - 3055108 , does not coincide within the errors ( 0.5@xmath54 for 2mass ) with the maser position , since it is located at 2.3@xmath54 from the centroid position .",
    "this implies that the outflow source must be heavily obscured by its circumstellar envelope . from these results",
    ", it is plausible that the iras point source actually traces this obscured source that is powering the masers , but it is not related to the optical source . in this case , the iras colors will classify iras16552 as a post - agb star , a classification also supported by its low iras variability . its likely post - agb nature , together with its association with high - velocity bipolar water - maser emission further indicates that iras16552 belongs to the water fountain class .    as for the spatial distribution of water masers within each group ,",
    "the redshifted ( ne ) cluster of masers is oriented almost along the north - south direction and extends @xmath42 0.04@xmath54 - 0.05@xmath54 in both epochs .",
    "the sw group is also oriented almost north - south in the first epoch and extends @xmath42 0.03@xmath54 .",
    "the distribution in the second epoch looks somewhat different , with an orientation along pa @xmath9 45@xmath55 , but given the relative errors ( see sec .",
    "[ obs ] ) , the distribution in this second epoch is less reliable . in any case , it seems clear that , if we assume that the line joining the red- and blueshifted groups traces the jet direction , the maser emission within each group is not elongated along this jet .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ ini ] and [ dec07 ] , the maser components within the redshifted cluster tend to be grouped according to their velocities , although the apparent grouping seems to be different in the two epochs . in the first epoch , the least redshifted group , with @xmath56  km  s@xmath1",
    "is located at the north , almost all the components of the intermediate - velocity group ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 ) are located at the south , and the most redshifted components ( @xmath58  km  s@xmath1 ) are situated in between the other two groups . in the second epoch ,",
    "the group centered @xmath59 km  s@xmath1 is north of the one centered @xmath60 km  s@xmath1 , which is the opposite distribution to the one in the first epoch .",
    "we note again that in the second epoch we did not observe the same velocity range as in the first one , and the positional error among the components of each group is larger in the second one ( @xmath47 as compared to @xmath61 ) . in the sw group ,",
    "no clear tendency in the distribution of radial velocities is seen in either epoch .",
    "the absence of near ir counterpart in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog @xcite does not seem to be an uncommon characteristic in the water fountains .",
    "of the 11 water fountains reported so far ( those listed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all those covered by the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) catalog @xcite ( only iras16552 was not included in the msx survey ) have a mid - infrared counterpart .",
    "however , we have found 2mass counterparts ( coincident with msx sources within the errors ) for only 5 of them .",
    "we did not find any significant relationship between the presence of a near ir counterpart and the characteristics of the water masers , such as number of maser components , dynamical age , or velocity span .",
    "the still small number of water fountains known is an obvious hindrance for this type of comparison .",
    "however , the fact that about half of the water fountains are not detected in the near ir gives us hints about the characteristics of their envelopes compared to those of the rest of agb and post - agb stars .",
    "both agb and post - agb stars are usually detected in the near ir , although a large fraction of agb stars , and some post - agb stars are not detected in the optical @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the central stars of water fountains are surrounded by thicker envelopes than in the rest of agb and post - agb stars .",
    "this could be explained if the evolution into the post - agb stage is faster in water fountain sources , and therefore , these stars are relatively massive ( @xmath62 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a study of the near ir properties of water fountains , with a higher sensitivity than the data in the 2mass catalog may yield the detection of weak counterparts , provided that an accurate position of the water maser emission is determined with radio interferometric observations .    in order to place iras16552 in the evolutionary framework of water fountains",
    ", we have plotted all such sources known on an iras two - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ coloriras ] ) , where we also show their dynamical ages ( for those known ) .",
    "it is interesting that water fountains tend to be distributed in this iras color - color diagram on the same region as post - agb stars @xcite , while in this region , few agb stars are located @xcite .",
    "this is certainly reasonable , given that water fountains seem to be post - agb or evolved agb stars .",
    "however , it is potentially important , since it suggests that iras colors could be useful as diagnostics to select potential candidate sources in future searches for water fountains among the most extreme agb stars .    to try to establish the evolutionary stage for each of the water fountains we have used the [ 8]@xmath8[12 ] _ vs _ [ 15]@xmath8[21 ] msx two - color diagram ( see fig  [ colormsx ] ) .",
    "@xcite has studied the position of oh - maser - emitting agb and post - agb sources in this diagram .",
    "the diagram has been divided in four quadrants ( qi , qii , qiii , qiv ) , with classical agb stars located in qiii ( low left ) , early post - agb stars in the qiv ( low right ) and more evolved objects in the qi , while qii contains star forming regions .",
    "the two water fountains with the shortest dynamical age are located in region iii , and the one with the longest in region i , which agrees with sevenster s evolutionary distribution .",
    "estimates of the dynamical ages of the rest of water fountains will be helpful to confirm this trend .",
    "moreover , the objects with visible lobes ( iras 16342@xmath83814 and iras 19134 + 2131 ) are in the qiv and qii region , always with [ 8]@xmath8[12]@xmath630.9 .",
    "according to @xcite , the transition from [ 8]@xmath8[12]@xmath640.9 to [ 8]@xmath8[12]@xmath630.9 implies the transition from agb to post - agb stars .",
    "the water maser components in water fountains seem to show always a spatial bipolar layout , although their distribution is rather different from one object to another .",
    "also the number of components is very variable from one source to another .",
    "there are sources as oh12.8@xmath80.9 which show only 2 or 3 water maser components with very similar velocities at the tips of each lobe @xcite , and sources as iras 18286@xmath80959 that show multiple components with significant velocity dispersion within each lobe , and also components located close to the center of the maser distribution , with intermediate velocities between those of the most extreme components @xcite . in the case of iras16552",
    ", it shows at least 15 components with a spread in velocities within each lobe of @xmath65  km  s@xmath1 , and an absence of equatorial masers .",
    "these spectral and spatial characteristics make it similar to other water fountains as iras 16342@xmath83814 @xcite , or iras 19134 + 2131 @xcite .",
    "we note that single - dish observations of the oh maser line at 1612 mhz did not show any maser emission in iras16552 @xcite , with 1@xmath36 rms of 0.2 , and 0.1 jy , respectively . the presence or not of oh maser emission , as well as",
    "its kinematical and spatial characteristics is of potential interest to further characterize water fountains .",
    "the presence of oh maser emission is a common characteristic in almost all water fountains .",
    "apart from iras16552 , the only other known water fountain in which oh seems not to be present is iras 19134 + 2131 @xcite .",
    "the oh masers detected are in general less extended and have a smaller range of velocities than the h@xmath3o masers , as is the case of iras 18043@xmath82126 @xcite , oh12.8@xmath80.9 @xcite , w43a @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the oh masers tend to trace the former agb shell , rather than the later bipolar mass - loss traced by h@xmath3o .",
    "however , the cases of iras 15445 - 5449 and iras 15544 - 5332 @xcite do not follow this trend , since oh maser emission in these sources have been found outside the velocity range of the h@xmath3o masers . iras 16342@xmath83814 can be considered as another exception since although the oh masers have a smaller velocity range than the h@xmath3o masers ( 70  km  s@xmath1 vs 160  km  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) , they are located in the bipolar jets and have a velocity that does not correspond to the agb shell .      as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the water maser emission in iras16552 is not aligned with the apparent jet direction .",
    "such misalignment is also common in other sources , as iras 19134 + 2131 @xcite and w43a @xcite .",
    "those cases can be explained as the effect of ballistic corkscrew jets @xcite , where the masers are emitted in a ballistic way along the direction of a jet that precesses with time .",
    "this precession could be due to the presence of a binary stellar companion or a massive planet .",
    "these companions would also account for the magnetic fields found in sources as w43a @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , no direct evidence for a companion has been found so far in any water fountain .",
    "iras16552 is an extreme case in which the water maser components are oriented almost perpendicular to the radial direction from the central source ( assumed to be at the center of the distribution of the components , see sec .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "an almost perpendicular distribution is also seen in iras 16342@xmath83814 @xcite and oh 12.8 - 0.9 @xcite , which has been attributed to the masers tracing a shock front . for iras16552 ,",
    "such an interpretation would imply a rather large opening angle of the jet ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "a possible alternative explanation is that the water masers in iras16552 trace a rapidly precessing / rotating bipolar jet .",
    "if the precession / rotation period is very short , as compared with the expansion timescale determined by the jet velocity , the bipolar jet ( or the shocked regions in the neutral envelope ) will describe point - symmetric structures oriented almost perpendicular to the outflow direction .",
    "at least qualitatively , this scenario may account for the observations of iras16552 , specially for the first epoch , in which the distribution of masers within each group has been determined with a higher accuracy .",
    "remarkably , many pne show collimated structures oriented almost perpendicular to the radial direction from the central star .",
    "this is the case of bipolar and elliptical pne that exhibit a point - symmetric intensity distribution in the shell as , for instance , hb5 @xcite and cn3 - 1 @xcite .",
    "more interesting is the case of components dd in ngc6543 @xcite , which are dense ( 10@xmath67 - 10@xmath68 @xmath69 ) filaments that have been interpreted as due to a rapidly precessing bipolar jet @xcite . given that water fountains are probably related to relatively massive stars ( sec .",
    "[ comparison ] ) , their evolution through the post - agb phase should be very fast .",
    "the fingerprints of rapidly precessing , collimated post - agb outflows , such as the one proposed for iras16552 , may still be present in the envelope when the central star ionizes the nebula and could show up as point - symmetric ionized filaments in pne , similar to the components dd in ngc6543 .",
    "in this paper we have presented vla observations of h@xmath3o masers at 22 ghz towards iras 16552@xmath83050 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follow :    * we have found that the water maser emission in iras 16552@xmath83050 span a velocity range of @xmath9170  km  s@xmath1 and shows a bipolar distribution of @xmath42 0.08  in size .",
