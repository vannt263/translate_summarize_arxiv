    "early - type stars of spectral type o , and their evolved descendants , the wolf - rayet stars , are among the hottest and brightest objects in the galaxy . through their large radiative and kinetic energy input",

    "finally , we give , in  [ sect : ccl ] , a summary of the main results of this work .",
    "the present work is based on over 30 high - resolution high s / n spectra of cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  obtained at the european southern observatory ( eso , la silla , chile ) and spanning a time interval of six years .",

    ", no reliable measurement could be obtained for the secondary , either because of the low s / n ratio or because of the important blend between primary and secondary lines . in those cases ,",

    "instrumental setups and reduction techniques have been described in e.g.  @xcite and will not be repeated here .    in parallel to the optical monitoring , six 30  ks x - ray exposures of the ngc  6231 cluster were performed by xmm__-newton _ _  in september 2001 .",
    "the campaign was described in @xcite and we restrain the description here to additional elements specific to cpd@xmath041@xmath17733 .",
    "for each of the six pointings and for the three epic  instruments , we extracted broad band x - ray light curves and spectra using the sas task _ evselect_. the circular extraction region was centered on the source position and , due to the presence of three bright x - ray neighbors ( , and ) , was limited to a radius of 115 ( fig .",

    "numerous metallic lines ( c , n , o , si and mg ions ) can also be identified .",

    "line positions and equivalent widths ( @xmath5 ) were measured by adjusting gaussian curves to the studied profiles .",
    "effective wavelengths for o - stars from @xcite below 4800    and from @xcite above were adopted to compute the radial velocities ( rvs ) .",

    "we then computed orbital solutions using individual rv sets associated with the different absorption lines listed in table [ tab : orbit_ne ] . for sb2 solutions ,",
    "the rv equations were transformed in order to symmetrically propagate the errors on the parameters associated with each of the components @xcite .",

    "we tested both circular and eccentric orbits but found that the latter did not improve the quality of the fit .",
    "table [ tab : orbit_ne ] lists the orbital solutions obtained for the data sets associated with different lines .",

    "we emphasize however that the uncertainty on the periodicity of the phenomenon ( which is independent of any model consideration ) is rather related to the peak width in the periodogram as stated at the beginning of this section .",
    "the other uncertainties ( always quoted as one standard deviation ) were computed by error propagation from the least - square fit .",
    "finally , we adopted the apparent systemic velocities of both components as the weighted means of the systemic velocities in the different -line solutions of table [ tab : orbit_ne ] : @xmath13kms@xmath14  and @xmath15kms@xmath14 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , three sb1 orbital solutions have previously been published .",
    "based on a set of 16 observations spread over 8.1 days plus four observations from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) obtained about 800 days earlier , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) derived the first sb1 orbital solution with a period @xmath16d , a small eccentricity @xmath17 and an amplitude for the primary radial velocity curve of @xmath18kms@xmath14 . with two more observations and including radial velocities from @xcite and @xcite ( but not those of @xcite , only published much latter ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) derived a new orbital solution .",
    "they found a larger period ( @xmath19d ) and eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) while the amplitude of the radial velocity curve remained mostly unchanged ( @xmath21kms@xmath14 ) .",
    "finally , cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  was observed once by iue . including this additional measurement , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) published a slightly modified orbit with @xmath22d , @xmath23 and @xmath24kms@xmath14 .",
    "they stated however that they could not include the data in their fit .",
    "though the present data set yields orbital parameters of the same order of magnitude than the ones obtained from previous works , fundamental contradictions exist between the different studies .",
    "our final period @xmath25d is significantly different from the previous determinations and we report a circular orbit while , for example , quoted an eccentricity up to @xmath26 .",
    "our derived semi - amplitude of the primary rv curve @xmath27 is systematically higher than the previously published values , with differences up to 10kms@xmath14  compared to and .",
    "it was thus crucial to check the previous orbital solutions using the different rv sets adopted by these authors .",
    "doing this , we noted that the second measurement listed by , at @xmath28kms@xmath14 , is clearly not fitted by the solution though it was included in the adjustment . actually its location in the phase diagram is shifted by about 0.2 in phase compared to the figure displayed by .",
    "this probably results from a typographic error in the published julian date , which explains why could not include observations in their combined solution .",
    "though we have been able to reproduce the results of and using their respective data sets , we could not reproduce the results proposed by .",
    "both the period value and , more particularly , the eccentricity derived from their data differ significantly . in all our computations ,",
    "whatever the data set used , the maximum eccentricity that we found was @xmath29 , with a null eccentricity well within a 2-@xmath11 interval .",
    "we thus definitively rule out the large eccentricity quoted by .",
    "furthermore , both the and data sets actually carried a strong ambiguity on the period , with more than ten strong aliases between 5.6 and 5.8 days . clearly , their period determination was far less constrained than what their error bars suggested .    finally , we combined all the available primary rv measurements ( except the point at @xmath30kms@xmath14 ) to derive a combined orbital solution .",
    "for the rvs from the present work , we used the averaged rvs reported in table [ tab : opt_diary ] to which we added the adopted primary systemic velocity @xmath31kms@xmath14 . a period search using both the lafler & kinman and the fourier analysis techniques ( see  [ ssect : orbit ] ) yield values close to 5.6815 d with an uncertainty of @xmath32 d. again no significant improvement of the quality of the fit is obtained assuming an eccentric orbit .",
    "[ fig : alias ] shows the values of the fit r.m.s .  for periods ranging from 5.6 to 5.8 d.",
    "clearly , the present analysis allows us to solve the ambiguity about the period that plagued earlier investigations .",
    "the best - fit orbital parameters are listed in table [ tab : orbit ] ( labeled lit. ) and the rv curve is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rv_lit ] .",
    "the corresponding heliocentric systemic velocity is @xmath33  kms@xmath14 .",
    "the spectral signature of the primary component is easily discernible in the spectrum of cpd@xmath041@xmath17733 . adopting the classification criteria from @xcite as adapted to late o - stars by @xcite",

    "the optical brightness of both components will be discussed in  [ sect : brightness ] .",
    "the main spectral signatures of the secondary star in cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  are the balmer and  lines .",
    "the absence of the  lines , as well as of the @xmath45592 line , at the positions predicted by the orbital solution definitively excludes an o spectral type and , at our detection threshold , most probably indicates a spectral subtype later than b0.7 @xcite . to refine our classification",
    ", we searched for the presence of secondary metallic lines .",
    "this led us to consider low intensity lines , with equivalent widths ( relative to the composite spectrum continuum ) down to @xmath390.01 .",
    "we therefore focused on the six feros spectra obtained at the eso / mpg 2.2 m telescope , that exhibit s / n ratios above 200 .",
    "mean primary and secondary equivalent widths as measured on these spectra are reported in table [ tab : lines_list ] .",
    "some of the secondary lines are clearly deblended from neighboring lines , and thus securely measured , in only one or two of these six spectra .",

    "the usual luminosity criterion in this spectral range is @xmath44552/@xmath44388 . from our measurements",
    ", we obtained a ratio of about one to ten ; this result definitively excludes a supergiant luminosity class , which is in agreement with the low intensity of the secondary  spectrum .",
    "similarly , this ratio seems to indicate a main sequence luminosity class rather than a giant class .",

    "we compared their mean @xmath5  with typical ( averaged ) @xmath5  of o8.5iii stars @xcite .",
    "based on the @xmath4@xmath44026 , 4388 , 4471 and @xmath4@xmath44542 , 4686 lines , we obtained an averaged brightness ratio corresponding to @xmath40 .",

    "the intensity of the detected lines in the secondary spectra is in rough agreement with a b3 iii - v classification but suggests a slightly larger luminosity ratio in favor of the primary component .",
    "adopting @xmath42 yields @xmath43 , which corresponds to a giant luminosity class for the primary though we note that the @xmath44686 line is stronger than in typical o8.5 giants .",
    "should we assume that the primary is a main sequence star , the comparison of the observed @xmath5  with typical @xmath5  for o8.5  v stars yields @xmath44 .",
    "this yields @xmath45 thus in contradiction with the v luminosity class hypothesis",
    ". clearly the spectroscopic classification criteria points towards the primary being a giant .",
    "typical absolute visual magnitudes for o8.5 stars are @xmath46 and @xmath47/@xmath48 for class iii and v respectively @xcite .",
    "the absolute visual magnitudes of b3 stars are @xmath49 and @xmath50 for giants and main - sequence stars respectively @xcite . to compute the visual magnitudes of the cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  components",
    ", we adopted the cluster distance modulus @xmath51 as obtained from the average of the different photometric results since the 1990 s @xcite and we used @xmath3 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 from @xcite . using @xmath54 as derived in the previous paragraph in the case of a giant primary and assuming that the secondary is also a giant , we obtained @xmath55 for the total magnitude of the system , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the primary and secondary respectively . under these hypotheses ,",
    "the primary is clearly fainter than typical o8.5 giants . adopting the effective temperature calibration and the bolometric correction of @xcite",
    ", we constrained the radii to values of @xmath58 r@xmath59  and @xmath60  r@xmath59 .",
    "again , the stars are too small compared to typical giants ( @xmath61  r@xmath59  and @xmath62  r@xmath59 ) .    therefore , if we assume that the cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  components are indeed main sequence objects , the same reasoning with @xmath63 yields @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and therefore @xmath69  r@xmath59  and @xmath70  r@xmath59",
    ". corresponding typical radii are , in this case , of 9.0  r@xmath59  and 4.2  r@xmath59  for o8.5 and b3 main sequence stars .",
    "we now observe a better agreement for the primary , but the secondary parameters are at odds with those of typical b3 dwarfs .    the best agreement between the deduced and typical parameters is obtained assuming that cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  harbors an o8.5  v and a b3  iii component . in the latter case , we derived @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73  r@xmath59  and @xmath74  r@xmath59 .",
    "this option is however rather unlikely .",
    "we finally note that a larger value for @xmath75 would significantly decrease the obtained secondary radius without affecting much @xmath76 .",
    "such a ratio largely in favor of the primary ( @xmath77 ) is indeed suggested by the typical o8.5 and b3 luminosities .    in summary",
    ", though the spectral criteria rather indicate a giant luminosity class for the primary , the estimated values for its magnitude and radius are more consistent with the primary being a main sequence star .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the case of , an eclipsing sb2 binary in ngc6231  for which the spectroscopic criteria clearly indicated a giant class . in @xcite",
    ", we inferred , from the system luminosity , much smaller radii than expected for giant stars .",
    "this was confirmed by the analysis of the system light curve @xcite and the resulting parameters are in good agreement with the typical values expected for dwarfs of the corresponding spectral types .",
    "the locations of the cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  components in the h - r diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) indicate a primary evolutionary age of 3 to 4  myr , in good agreement with previous age estimates for the cluster .",
    "this suggests that the primary is only just leaving the main sequence and could explain why the star displays properties somewhat intermediate between those of a dwarf and a giant . in this respect ,",
    "the estimate of the brightness ratio based on the dilution of the primary lines might have been biased .",
    "it is thus probable that both components display stellar radii typical of main sequence objects .",

    "24 ) m@xmath59  @xcite . comparing this with the minimal values obtained in table [ tab : orbit ]",
    "indicates that the orbital inclination of the system is probably around 74  ( resp .",
    "this corresponds to a secondary mass around 7 to 9  m@xmath59 , which is slightly lower than typical values of b3  iii stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is consistent with b3 main sequence stars . adopting the different values for the radii derived in the previous section , we found that cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  should not display eclipses unless @xmath78 .",
    "clearly this is a limiting case . referring to a paper in preparation by @xcite",
    ", @xcite announced that the star was displaying magnitude variations larger than 015 .",
    "this result was however not confirmed once the mentioned paper finally appeared as @xcite . from our photometric campaign of the cluster @xcite , the r.m.s .  of the data",
    "set associated to cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  is about 0012 , slightly larger than the expected noise .",
    "the peak - to - peak variations over the one month time span of our campaign is 0.05mag at maximum .",
    "a power spectral analysis indicates a slightly dominant peak at @xmath79  d@xmath14 in both filters , thus tentatively suggesting a period close to 12  d although this can not be the signature of eclipses .    as a last point",
    ", we estimated the projected rotational velocity @xmath80 of the primary star by comparing the full widths at half maximum of several lines with those given by model spectra computed with an effective temperature and a gravity value corresponding to the above estimates for the primary component ranging from 50 to 300kms@xmath14  with a step of 10kms@xmath14 , using the tlusty and synspec codes @xcite that use line blanketed , nlte , plane - parallel , hydrostatic atmospheres . ] .",
    "based on the lines quoted in table [ tab : orbit_ne ] ( with the exception of @xmath4@xmath44471 and 7065 ) , we derived @xmath81kms@xmath14 .",
    "given a probable inclination of 65 - 75 , this value is slightly larger , still compatible within the error bars , with a synchronous rotation rate ( corresponding , for @xmath82r@xmath59 , to @xmath83kms@xmath14 ) .",

    "we performed a time series analysis similar to the one carried out for , the central target of the field @xcite . again",
    "no significant variation could be consistently detected for any of the three instruments .",
    "this strongly suggests that , at our detection threshold , the x - ray emission from cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  is mostly constant .    to constrain the physical properties of the emitting plasma , we adjusted a series of optically thin thermal plasma mekal  models @xcite to the spectra obtained during each xmm__-newton _ _  observation .",

    "mass - loss rates and terminal velocities were estimated following @xcite . as expected , the primary wind is overwhelmingly dominant and no ram pressure equilibrium is possible on the system axis .",
    "this suggests that the primary wind will crash into the secondary star surface .",
    "however , using the formalism of @xcite , one estimates that the amount of x - ray emission that could be produced by such an interaction is about 10@xmath102 ergs@xmath14 , thus two orders of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic contribution of the two stellar components . as the cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  orbit is circular , we further do not expect to observe an intrinsic modulation of the emitted flux resulting from a variation of the shock strength , which is thus in agreement with our observations .",
    "the x - ray emission of cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  is thus very representative of the x - ray emission of normal o - type stars and , indeed , it is very well fitted by the newly obtained canonical relation @xmath103 , derived for the o - type stars in ngc6231  @xcite .",
    "we present the results of a high - resolution spectroscopic campaign on the o - type binary cpd@xmath041@xmath17733 .",
    "we report the first detection of the secondary spectral signature and we derive the very first sb2 orbital solution for the system .",
    "the orbital period is close to 5.681  d and the orbit is most probably circular .",
    "the new orbital elements are significantly different from those obtained in previous works . using the same data sets as previous authors",
    ", we find that their period values were poorly constrained because of a strong aliasing that resulted from the spread of a small number of observations over a large time span .",
    "we also combined all the observations available from the literature in a joint orbital solution .",
    "the resulting orbital elements are in perfect agreement with those found using our data set alone .",
    "cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  most probably consists of an o8.5 star plus a b3 companion .",
    "though different criteria yield discrepant luminosity classifications , both stars probably display physical parameters close to those of typical o8.5 and b3 dwarfs .",
    "though the orbital inclination is rather large ( around 65 - 75 ) , our photometric campaign on ngc6231  did not reveal any eclipse . finally , we estimated the projected rotational velocity of the primary to be around 85kms@xmath14 , slightly larger than , but still compatible within the error bars , with the synchronous rotation rate .",
    "we also analyze the x - ray light curves and spectra of cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  obtained during the six xmm__-newton _ _  pointings towards the cluster .",
    "we find no significant variability between the different pointings , nor within the individual observations .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well reproduced by a two - temperature thermal mekal  model with k@xmath104  kev and k@xmath105  kev .",
    "the merged spectrum built from the combination of the six pointings shows an additional higher energy component .",
    "the latter can be described either by a mekal  model with an energy close to 2.4 kev or by a power - law component with a photon index @xmath106 close to 3 , though the latter value is very loosely constrained .",
    "no x - ray overluminosity resulting from a possible wind interaction phenomenon is observed and , indeed , none is expected at our detection level . as a consequence , the emission of cpd@xmath041@xmath17733  should be very representative of typical o - type star x - ray emission .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the referee , dr . d. gies , for detailed and helpful suggestions , as well as n. linder for running the synspec and tlusty codes .",
    "the authors are greatly indebted towards the fnrs , belgium .",
    "this work was supported by the prodex xmm and integral projects , contracts p4/05 and p5/36 ` ple dattraction interuniversitaire ' ( belgium ) .",
