    "a better understanding of the physical mechanism behind the current cosmic acceleration is one of the major challenges both for the cosmology and fundamental physics . in the framework of the general theory of relativity ,",
    "the cosmic acceleration can be explained either if a new hypothetical energy component with negative pressure ( dark energy ) dominates the current composition of the cosmos  @xcite or if the matter content of the universe is subject to dissipative processes ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "following the first route , the simplest and most natural candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant , @xmath3 , which corresponds to the energy density stored in the true vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe . from the observational point of view",
    ", it is well known that the @xmath3cdm model is in good agreement with almost all sets of cosmological observations . despite its observational successes ,",
    "it suffers at least from two problems .",
    "first , and possibly the most serious one is the cosmological constant problem ( ccp ) in which the cosmological upper bound ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) differs from theoretical expectations ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ) by more than 100 orders of magnitude . the other is known as coincidence problem and consists to understand why @xmath7 is not only small , but also of the same order of magnitude of the energy density of cold dark matter ( cdm )  @xcite .",
    "an attempt to alleviate the cosmological constant problems is to allow the vacuum energy and dark matter to interact , leading to the so - called vacuum decay models for which @xmath3 is necessarily a time - dependent quantity .",
    "cosmological scenarios with a dynamical @xmath3 term were independently proposed about two decades ago in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite for interacting models in the which the dark energy is represented by a smooth component parametrized by an equation of state @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) .",
    "most of these scenarios have specific decay laws for @xmath3 which lead to particular cosmological solutions and phenomenology ( see , e.g. , table i of @xcite for some proposed @xmath3 decay laws ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a general cosmological scenario of @xmath3-cdm interaction in which the attenuated dilution of cdm is described by an arbitrary function of the cosmic scale factor @xmath1 .",
    "we show that this class of models has many of the previous phenomenological scenarios as a particular case . using thermodynamic considerations",
    ", it is shown that the function @xmath1 is proportional to the entropy source of the associated particle creation process .",
    "we discuss some interesting cosmological consequences of this @xmath3-cdm interaction , such as a possible loitering phase in a spatially flat universe and carry out a joint statistical analysis with recent observations of type ia supernovae , baryonic acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background data to test its observational viability .",
    "we work in units where @xmath10 .",
    "according to the bianchi identities , the einstein field equations , @xmath11 , implies that @xmath3 is necessarily a constant either if the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields and cdm particles @xmath12 is null or if it is separately conserved , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "this amounts to saying that the presence of a time - varying cosmological term results in a coupling between @xmath3 and other cosmic component . by considering the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker space - time and a coupling between @xmath3 and cdm particles",
    ", we have that @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy densities of cdm and @xmath3 respectively and the dot sign denotes derivative with respect to the time .",
    "as the cosmological term interacts with cdm particles , their energy density will dilute slowly compared with the standard relation , @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the deviation from the standard dilution may be characterized by the function @xmath1 , such that @xmath18 by substituting the relation ( [ ansatz ] ) into ( [ ec ] ) , we find @xmath19 where for @xmath20 the standard @xmath3cdm scenario is fully recovered . note that for @xmath21 the dynamical @xmath22cdm scenarios recently discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite are obtained whereas the vacuum decay model with @xmath23 investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite is recovered when @xmath24 .",
    "more general coupled quintessence scenarios in which the coupling is written in terms of the scalar field @xmath25 as @xmath26  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where @xmath27 is a coupling function , are recovered by identifying @xmath28    in this paper , we will work with the @xmath1 function as a power series of scale factor , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants . from eqs .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) , ( [ dla ] ) and ( [ expan ] ) , we find @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integration constant .",
    "now , neglecting the radiation contribution and considering that the baryonic content is separately conserved , the expansion rate of the universe can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 represents the density parameter of baryons , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the present critical energy density . in",
    "what follows , we will restrict our analysis up to the first order expansion of @xmath1 .",
    "the practical reason for this choice is shown in figure 1 where the ratio @xmath44 as a function of the redshift is displayed for first ( solid line ) and second order expansions in @xmath1 assuming the best - fit values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 discussed in sec .",
    "iv . clearly , higher order terms do not modify the ratio between @xmath3 and the cdm component for the interval considered .",
    "we note that an expansion rate similar to eq .",
    "( [ aga ] ) has been explored in reconstruction studies of the dark energy density ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "let us now consider some thermodynamic aspects of interaction between the vacuum and cdm particles .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of a decaying vacuum system is simplified either if one assumes that the chemical potential of the vacuum component is zero or if the vacuum medium plays the role of a condensate carrying no entropy , as happens in the two fluid description employed in the super fluid thermodynamics @xcite .    in this case",
    ", the thermodynamic description requires only the knowledge of the particle flux , @xmath48 , and entropy flux , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the concentration and the specific entropy ( per particle ) of the created component .",
    "the equation for @xmath52 has necessarily a source term , i.e. , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is particle source @xmath55 , or a sink @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the rate of change of particle number . since @xmath58 , eq . ( [ ansatz ] ) gives @xmath59 substituting above equation in eq .",
    "( [ conc ] ) , it follows that @xmath60 as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy exchange between the vacuum and the cold dark matter may take place in several ways .",
    "the most physically relevant case has been termed adiabatic decaying vacuum . in this case , several equilibrium relations are preserved , and perhaps more importantly the entropy of created particles increases wheras the specific entropy ( per particle ) remains constant @xmath61 .",
    "this mean that @xmath62 from eqs .",
    "( [ taxa ] ) and ( [ entro ] ) it is straightforward to show that @xmath63 the second law of thermodynamics , therefore , implies that @xmath1 must be an increasing function of the scale factor , which requires @xmath64 .",
    "physically , this result indicates that only an energy flow from vacuum to cold dark matter is allowed . as discussed in the next section , this is in disagreement with current observational constraints that favor an energy flow from dark matter to vacuum @xmath65 .",
    "in order to delimit the parametric space @xmath66 we perform a joint analysis involving current sne ia , bao and cmb data . in our analysis , we fix @xmath67 from wmap results  @xcite ( which is also in good agreement with the bounds on the baryonic component derived from primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite ) and marginalize over the hubble parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we use one of the most recent sne ia compilation , the so - called union 2 sample compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite which includes 557 data points after selection cuts . following ref .",
    "@xcite we also use measurements derived from the product of the cmb acoustic scale @xmath69 and from the ratio of the sound horizon scale at the drag epoch to the bao dilation scale , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the comoving angular - diameter distance to recombination ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 is the comoving sound horizon at photon decoupling . in the above expressions",
    ", @xmath74 is the redshift of the drag epoch ( at which the acoustic oscillations are frozen in ) and the dilation scale , @xmath75 , is given by @xmath76^{1/3}$ ] . by combining the ratio @xmath77  @xcite with the measurements of @xmath78 at @xmath79 0.20 , 0.35 and 0.6 .",
    ", one finds @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we minimize the function @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 correspond to the sne ia and cmb / bao @xmath86 functions , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows confidence regions ( 68.3% cl and 95.4% ) in @xmath66 plane obtained from this joint analysis . at @xmath87",
    "we found @xmath88 and @xmath89 . as expected , we found values of @xmath90 since it acts as a curvature term ( @xmath91 ) in eq .",
    "( [ aga ] ) . as shown in section iii , the interacting parameter @xmath92 is restricted from thermodynamical arguments to be positive . by considering this physical constraint on @xmath92 and minimizing the function @xmath93",
    ", we obtain @xmath94 and @xmath95 at @xmath96 level . an observational comparison between the model here described and the coupled quintessence scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite can be made by comparing the above estimates for @xmath92 with the constraints on the coupling function @xmath27 [ see eq .",
    "( [ comp ] ) ] . for the case",
    "in which @xmath27 remains constant with @xmath97 , ref .",
    "@xcite used lss and cmb data to found @xmath98 , which is in full agreement with the bounds on @xmath92 obtained in our analysis .    for the sake of completeness , we also derive the time evolution of the density parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 which are given , respectively , as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 with the logarithm of the scale factor @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , which correspond to lower limit , best - fit and upper limit ( at @xmath87 of confidence ) from statistical analysis described above . in all cases a mix of baryons ( @xmath114 ) and",
    "dark matter ( @xmath115 ) dominates the past evolution of the universe whereas the contributions relative to the integration constant @xmath116 and the interaction parameter @xmath46 vanish at high - z . as expected , and in agreement with observational data , we note that @xmath116 is the dominant component from a value of @xmath117 on , while the interaction parameter @xmath118 is always the subdominant throughout cosmic evolution .",
    "another interesting aspect of this flat vacuum decay model is that it can accommodate a loitering phase . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a loitering phase is characterized by a @xmath119 .",
    "deriving eq .",
    "( [ aga ] ) and using the loitering condition , we find ( @xmath120 ) @xmath121 in the context of this flat interacting model , the existence of a recent loitering phase is possible only if @xmath122 . by considering the obsevational limits on these parameters given above , we note that a realistic loitering phase is possible only in the future ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "finally , by considering that @xmath124 , it follows that @xmath125 , which clearly shows that models with a loitering phase are compatible with an accelerating universe , as indicated by sne ia data .",
    "we have discussed cosmological consequences of a new cosmological scenario of vacuum decay in which the deviation of standard evolution of the cold dark matter component is characterized by an arbitrary function of the cosmic scale factor @xmath1 .",
    "using thermodynamic arguments , we have shown that the interaction function @xmath1 is proportional to the entropy source of the particle creation process , which means that only an energy flow from vacuum to cold dark matter is allowed .",
    "we have investigated the observational viability of this class of models from recent data of sne ia and the distance ratio from baryon acoustic oscillation at different redshifts and cmb decoupling at @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath1 can be expanded in a power series of the scale factor , we find strong constraints on the parameters of this model , with a slight deviation from standard @xmath3cdm dynamics .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that we have restricted the present analysis to coupled quintessence models in which @xmath127 ( dynamical @xmath3 models , whereas a full treatment of the dark matter - dark energy interaction must also take into account the role of the dark energy equation - of - state in the process .",
    "some theoretical and observational consequences of a @xmath128-cdm interacting scenario with a time - dependent coupling term , as well as a scalar field description for this class of models is currently under investigation .",
