    "the creation of soc in spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) not only offers us a new platform to simulate the response of charged particles to external electromagnetic field , but also opens up an entirely new paradigm for studying strong correlations of quantum many - body systems , which enables quantum simulations of condensed matter phenomena because of the high controllability of the system  @xcite .",
