    "large area redshift surveys such as sdss @xcite and gama @xcite have established a new paradigm regarding the clustering of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary effects imposed by this range of environments are not fully understood , largely due to the complexity of n - body interactions on star formation and gas dynamics .",
    "however , the relatively unexplored regime of neutral hi  in the context of galaxy groups has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the mechanisms influencing how galaxies mature .",
    "targeted observations of the hi  content in nearby groups have often revealed the presence of intragroup material , for example , with the very large array ( vla e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the parkes radio telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the australia telescope compact array ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nanay @xcite . however , systematic surveys of galaxy groups are rare due to the observational time necessary to achieve the required sensitivities , even at relatively modest redshifts , over large fields of view .",
    "the blind , wide - area arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey @xcite , combined with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr7 group catalogue @xcite , enabled @xcite to explore the hi  content of group galaxies as a function of optical group membership .",
    "they found evidence for gas pre - processing correlated with group assembly .",
    "meanwhile , the blind ultra deep hi survey ( budhies ) on the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , a targeted survey at @xmath4 , combines accurate hi  content with morphology in environments ranging from voids to cluster centres to show evidence for both ram pressure and pre - processing as mechanisms for gas removal @xcite .",
    "the role of compact groups , in particular , has long been advocated for understanding galaxy evolution processes : their high galaxy densities combined with relatively shallow potential wells prolongs strong gravitational interactions . @xcite",
    "defined compact groups as having 4 or more members within a 3 magnitude range ( @xmath5 mb ) that form a physically isolated system .",
    "the original hickson catalogue has been modified based on radial velocity information with 92 groups having at least three accordant members @xcite .",
    "although other compact group catalogues exist , it remains the most intensively studied sample .    the hi  deficiency in compact group galaxies @xcite was the focus of a single - dish study of 72 hcgs by @xcite . in combination with a subset resolved by the vla , the authors proposed an evolutionary sequence where galaxies become increasingly hi  deficient due to multiple tidal interactions .",
    "the study of compact group evolution was expanded by green bank telescope ( gbt ) observations from @xcite which suggested the presence of copious diffuse , low column - density neutral hydrogen gas between the galaxies . however , even this emission is not always able to account for the hi  deficiency of compact groups .",
    "further studies suggest that the most evolved groups , which are also dominated by elliptical galaxies , begin to exhibit signs of hot intragroup gas due to gravitational heating @xcite .",
    "however , strong hi  deficiency does not guarantee the presence of intragroup x - ray emitting gas , complicating the interpretation of what mechanisms are responsible for removing the cold gas @xcite .    additional evidence of evolution within compact groups has come from photometry from the _ spitzer _ space telescope : bimodality in irac color - color space , appearing to correlate with hi  depletion , suggests accelerated evolution from dusty , star - forming galaxies , to gas - poor systems @xcite . detailed studies by @xcite further support a picture of accelerated evolution . evidence of shock - excited h@xmath6  in several compact group galaxies led @xcite to suggest a connection between intragroup tidal debris and rapid quenching in these groups .",
    "hcg 44 is a relatively nearby compact group with redshift @xmath7 and an angular diameter of approximately @xmath8 .",
    "it contains four massive galaxies : three star - forming spirals ( ngc  3185 , ngc  3187 , ngc  3190 ) , and one elliptical which is undetected in hi  ( ngc  3193 ) ; and the hi  cloud , @xmath9 , which lacks an apparent optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are highly hi - deficient @xcite , but x - ray emission is confined to individual galaxies with no detectable diffuse x - ray emission associated with the intragroup medium @xcite , leaving the missing hi  unaccounted for .",
    "further , the lack of diffuse hot gas brings into question the importance of ram pressure stripping as a mechanism for removing gas from the large galaxies in this system .",
    "@xcite found excited h@xmath6  in ngc  3190 , perhaps shocked from impact with the intragroup medium , but gbt observations are unable to resolve individual galaxies , and high resolution interferometry observations have not yet detected intragroup hi  within the core of the compact group .",
    "in fact , the evolutionary stage of the compact group has been debated as the hi  content suggests it is more advanced , while the lack of intragroup optical light from stars , and intragroup x - rays suggest it is younger @xcite .    as part of the atlas@xmath10 survey , @xcite surveyed the neutral gas content of hcg 44 and found evidence for an extended hi  distribution well beyond the compact group .",
    "deeper wsrt data , combined with reprocessed hipass data , detected the presence of a @xmath11kpc long tail to the north of hcg  44 containing @xmath12 of hi  @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that this tail is most likely the result of tidal interactions and proposed possible scenarios .",
    "first , the tail is the result of a high speed interaction between ngc 3162 and the compact group which occurred up to 3 gyr in the past .",
    "ngc  3162 lies @xmath131.4 deg ( 620 kpc at the assumed distance ) northwest of hcg  44 .",
    "second , the tail is a result of tidal stripping due to ngc 3187 interacting with the gravitational potential of the compact group , which would explain its very disturbed optical morphology .",
    "however , they noted that deeper hi  data over a larger field would benefit detailed modeling of this system .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the extended region around hcg  44 and the northern tail by conducting a deep hi  mosaic with the karoo array telescope ( kat-7 ) which , due to its sensitivity and resolution , is ideal for detecting low column density hi  gas @xcite .",
    "we combine these data with the deep wsrt pointing from @xcite , and an hi  map spanning the same sky coverage from the alfalfa survey to improve our overall picture of the hi  distribution in the compact group , and nearby surroundings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ data ]",
    "we describe the kat-7 observations , and summarize the additional data . in section [ combo ]",
    "we describe our technique for combining interferometric images from kat-7 and wsrt , and the single dish map from alfalfa . in section [ results ]",
    "we compare the measurements from kat-7 and alfalfa and present our results from the combined data cube . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the possible origins and the fate of the extended hi  tail .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "hcg  44 and the hi  tail ( @xmath14 ; @xcite ) were observed with the kat-7 telescope @xcite in two pointings : one centered on the group itself ( @xmath15 ; hereafter field 1 ) , and one centered on the northern tail discovered by @xcite ( @xmath16 ; hereafter field 2 ) .",
    "field 1 was observed with all seven antennas in 11 sessions between 2015 jan 9  2015 may 20 for a total of 30 hours on source .",
    "field 2 was later observed with six available antennas in 8 sessions between 2015 july 3  2015 july 13 for a total of 36.25 hours on source .",
    "field 1 was observed during the night , whereas field 2 had primarily day time observations and was affected by solar interference which resulted in more intensive flagging during data reduction .",
    "the kat-7 data were reduced in casa 4.4.0 @xcite using standard procedures . as a first step , we flagged all @xmath17 data to remove low level radio frequency interference ( rfi ) that is correlated when the fringe rate is equal to zero ( see @xcite for a complete explanation ) .",
    "after flux and gain calibration , we performed continuum subtraction using a first order fit in the task uvcontsub and imaged each observation individually for quality assurance .",
    "field 1 and field 2 achieved an rms noise of 2.7 and 2.9 mjy  beam@xmath18 , respectively , over 7.7  kms@xmath18  channels , despite the differing total observing times between the fields .",
    "we performed self - calibration on the continuum data of the target field and applied it to the spectral line data .",
    "this generally produced a factor of 1.2 improvement in the rms noise , and up to a factor of 1.5 in individual data sets .",
    "the final mosaic improved to 1.7 mjy  beam@xmath18 , with a @xmath19 arcsec beam , thanks to self calibration and overlap between the fields .",
    "we converted this to column density using equation 1 from @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is in mjy , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the major and minor axes of the beam in arcseconds , and @xmath24 is the channel width in kms@xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to a 1 @xmath25 hi  column density of @xmath26 @xmath1 channel@xmath18 .",
    "figure [ wise ] shows the hi  contours of the kat-7 mosaic overlaid on a four - color image from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) .",
    "we describe the method for generating these contours in section [ results ] .",
    "@xcite observed hcg  44 with the wsrt for @xmath27 hours at a single pointing centered between the group and the hi  tail ( @xmath28 . the observations achieved an rms of 0.23 mjy  beam@xmath18 with a beam of @xmath29 arcsec over 8.2  kms@xmath18  channels .",
    "hcg  44 also falls in the portion of sky observed by the alfalfa survey .",
    "a full description of the survey strategy can be found in @xcite and @xcite but , in short , alfalfa is a two - pass , fixed - azimuth , drift scan survey covering the velocity range from @xmath30 to @xmath31  kms@xmath18 .",
    "we obtained a data cube spanning @xmath32 to @xmath33 and @xmath34  kms@xmath18 .",
    "the cube has an overall rms of 2.67 mjy beam@xmath18 with a @xmath35 arcsec beam and 5.15  kms@xmath18  channels .",
    "we note that the data cube was affected by low level rfi in the declination strip that passed through the compact group itself @xcite , but we are able to take this into consideration with the weights map that is simultaneously created in the alfalfa data reduction process .",
    "traditional methods of combining radio data between different arrays , or between arrays ( interferometers ) and single - dish measurements , may employ methods which operate in either the ( @xmath36,@xmath37)-plane or in the image plane ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the contribution of each measurement is generally weighted by the inverse square of the rms , @xmath38 . in the case of hcg  44 ,",
    "the wsrt observations are an order of magnitude more sensitive than the kat-7 data in jy beam@xmath18 , making an attempt at traditional combination relatively fruitless .    however , recognizing that the wsrt beam is more than an order of magnitude smaller in area than the kat-7 beam , @xcite demonstrate an innovative and powerful method of combining kat-7 and wsrt mosaics to reveal the presence of a low surface brightness tail in virgo galaxy , ngc  4424 .",
    "their technique realizes the strengths of both telescopes by converting the cubes to column density units which removes the dependence of the measured rms on the beam size , and allows the image cubes to be combined with more equal weights . as a result ,",
    "the final image of ngc  4424 has the advantage of sensitivity to large - scale structure from the short baselines of kat-7 , and high resolution from wsrt .",
    "the full procedure is described in @xcite and we highlight the details relevant to the successful combination of our data below .",
    "we employed the same technique to combine the interferometry data with the alfalfa maps .",
    "the most common method of combining interferometry and single - dish observations is to `` feather '' the data sets .",
    "this refers to performing a fourier transform ( ft ) on the individual data to the @xmath39-plane , scaling and combining them , then performing an inverse ft back to the image plane @xcite .",
    "this is typically done because the single - dish and interferometers measure different spatial scales , and the single - dish data is being combined to get the zero - spacing measurement .",
    "however , the short baselines of kat-7 ( 26185 m ) measure effectively the same spatial scales as arecibo ( illuminated diameter of 208 m ) , and the alfalfa drift scans have been synthesized to data cubes from which to extract hi  detections .",
    "thus , we use the alfalfa beam information to convert the alfalfa cube to column density units , and combine with the kat-7 and wsrt data in the image plane . formally , as long as the data is weighted appropriately , the methods produce comparable quality results @xcite .    ) .",
    "the black contour corresponds to the @xmath40 @xmath1 column density contours of the original wsrt observation @xcite .",
    "the dotted line is the half power of the kat-7 mosaic .",
    "the beams from each telescope are shown in the lower right hand corner , in order of decreasing size : kat-7 ( elongated ) , alfalfa ( round ) , smoothed wsrt .",
    "the wsrt and alflfa data cubes we acquired do not extend as far south as the kat-7 mosaic , so ngc  3177 does not appear in this image . ]      to optimize the final weighting scheme versus desired resolution , the wsrt cube from @xcite was smoothed with a @xmath41 arcsec gaussian kernel resulting in an effective restoring beam of @xmath42 arcsec and rms noise of 0.39 mjy beam@xmath18 . as further preparation , the kat-7 , wsrt , and alfalfa cubes were smoothed in velocity using a boxcar kernel of 2 , 2 , and 3 channels , respectively , and decimated in order to achieve the lowest multiple common velocity resolution in independent channels .",
    "the kat-7 and alfalfa cubes were then regridded to match the velocity and spatial axes of the wsrt cube , so that the resulting cubes have the same pixel size and dimensions ( @xmath43  kms@xmath18 ) .",
    "all cubes were converted to column density per unit velocity by the following equation : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hi  intensity of pixel ( @xmath46,@xmath47 ) in mjy  beam@xmath18  kms@xmath18 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the major and minor axes of the restoring beam in arcseconds .",
    "the resulting kat-7 , wsrt , and alfalfa data cubes have rms noise of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 @xmath1(kms@xmath18)@xmath18 , respectively .    before linear combination ,",
    "the kat-7 and wsrt mosaics were primary beam corrected .",
    "casa automatically generates a primary beam pattern when the visibilities are imaged , which we used to correct the kat-7 data . with only the final wsrt image cube",
    ", we assumed the primary beam correction to be a gaussian profile with 35 arcmin width .",
    "the wsrt data was imaged well beyond the primary beam of the telescope , and if combined linearly with the kat-7 and alfalfa data , the final image would be wsrt noise dominated at large distances from the wsrt pointing center .",
    "thus , we only combine with wsrt where the primary beam sensitivity is at least 30% of the peak .",
    "we experimented with combining the image cubes with increasingly complex set of weights to take into account different considerations .",
    "most simply , the kat-7 and wsrt primary beam corrected cubes , and alfalfa cube were weighted by the square of the rms and combined such that : @xmath53 @xmath54    the resulting cube is dominated by the kat-7 observations throughout .    despite the relatively large field of view of kat-7 ( approximately 1 degree at the half power beam width )",
    ", it also falls off in sensitivity with distance from the mosaic pointing centers , while the alfalfa sensitivity is fairly flat across the field .",
    "thus , in our final image combination , we take into account not only the relative rms noise at the most sensitive part of the images , but the change in sensitivity across the field of view due to the primary beam @xcite .",
    "we also consider the alfalfa weights map such that : @xmath55    this cube is dominated by the kat-7 observations at the center and the alfalfa observations at the outskirts .",
    "this also means that the effective synthesized beam changes across the field .",
    "however , because the final beam size of kat-7 and alfalfa are similar , we do not consider it to be a significant complication to the interpretation of the final data cube .",
    "see the beams in figure [ mom0 ] , for example .",
    "the peak rms sensitivity of this final cube improves to @xmath56 @xmath1(kms@xmath18)@xmath18 at a velocity resolution of 16.4  kms@xmath18 .",
    "the mean rms across the image is @xmath57 @xmath1(kms@xmath18)@xmath18 .",
    "perhaps the greatest benefit of this combination is that the kat-7 and alfalfa cubes individually contain residual artifacts whose patterns are characteristic to the telescope , but by combining them one is better able to differentiate between noise and diffuse low - level emission . throughout the rest of the paper ,",
    "the hi  data presented are measured or calculated from the combined kat-7 , wsrt , alfalfa ( kwa ) image cube , unless otherwise specified ( equation [ finalcube ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath58ngc  3187 and ngc  3190 are blended in the kat-7 data .",

    "in figure [ mom0 ] , we present the hi  total intensity map derived from the combined kwa data cube .",
    "the map was made by smoothing the cube with a @xmath67 arcmin beam , and masking regions where the emission was greater than 1.5@xmath25 in the original cube .",
    "the mask was inspected and modified to keep regions with emission spatially contiguous over at least 2 channels , and remove peaks suspected to be residual rfi .",
    "we took particular care to include even potential emission in the region between hcg  44 and the northern hi  tail ( see section [ origins ] for further explanation ) .",
    "the mask was similarly inspected and applied to the kat-7 data and was used to generate the contours overlaid in figure [ wise ] .",
    "the addition of the kat-7 and alfalfa observations shows that the hi  tail extends further than previously detected with wsrt .",
    "based on low signal - to - noise hipass images , @xcite found that the tail stretched 300 kpc in projection . at the assumed distance of 25 mpc ( see section [ dists ] ) , we find the extended tail spans nearly 450 kpc ( 62 arcmin ) in projection and is arguably resolved into seven to eight clumps .",
    "the extent is measured from the southern extension ( cloud 1 ) , through the brightest part of the tail , to the northwestern cloud 8 .",
    "the physical length of the tail may be even longer than what is seen in projection .",
    "our images reveal the breadth , mass , column density , and velocity dispersion of the tail that was unresolved by hipass . throughout the rest of this work",
    ", we will refer to the tail resolved by the wsrt maps as @xmath14 , and the full extent revealed by the kwa combined data , which includes @xmath14 , as the `` extended tail . ''",
    "in addition to hcg  44 , we detect the suspected background galaxy , sdss  1017723.29 + 214757.9 ( hereafter sdss  1017 ; @xcite ) , and likely foreground galaxy , lsbc  f567 - 01 .",

    "finally , ugc  5574 and ugc  5575 are also detected and , while not formally part of hcg  44 , are likely part of the larger associated group of galaxies @xcite .",

    "we take the published integrated flux and convert to hi  mass using our assumed distances , and the standard equation : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the intergrated flux in jy  kms@xmath18 , @xmath71 is the distance in mpc , and @xmath72 is the hi  mass computed in units of solar mass . these values are given in table [ sources ] .",
    "the greatest source of error on the true hi  mass content is the uncertainty in distance to individual galaxies both in and around the compact group .",
    "ned gives estimates corrected for virgo infall of order @xmath73 mpc , while distances assumed in the literature range from 18.4 to 25 mpc @xcite .",
    "the ngc 3190 group itself is part of a broader filamentary structure , so distance estimates from recessional velocities can be significantly distorted by infall onto the filament . following the convention of wsrt and alfalfa studies ,",
    "we assume a distance of 25 mpc to hcg  44 member galaxies ngc  3185 , ngc  3187 , ngc  3190 , to the cloud , @xmath9 , and the extended tail .",
    "we assume the same for ngc  3177 , ugc  5574 , and ugc  5575 which have similar recessional velocities and are at the same distance , within uncertainties , in velocity flow models of the region ( see table [ sources ] ) .",

    "table [ sources ] provides a comparison of the hi  masses between the kat-7 observations , the kwa results , and previous observations from a range of telescope facilities .",
    "a cursory look reveals that the interpretation of fluxes from different facilities is not straight forward .",
    "the amount of hi  detected by a given telescope is dependent on the size scales to which it is sensitive .",
    "for example , if there is a significant amount of intragroup gas , we expect kat-7 and alfalfa to report more gas than wsrt , perhaps less gas than the gbt , and produce similar results to one another .",
    "errors in the absolute flux calibration would also produce different results between facilities .",
    "recalibrating data from five different telescopes to ensure consistency in the absolute flux calibration is outside the scope of this paper , however our observations give us the opportunity to comment on the relative flux calibration between kat-7 and alfalfa .    among systematic sources of error ,",
    "fitting a baseline to the data is particularly critical to account for both broadband continuum emission , and small scale residual bandpass fluctuations that may remain to separate the spectral line emission of individual galaxies @xcite . for both kat-7 and alfalfa",
    "the baseline fitting takes place in a two step process .",
    "there is a first pass to remove broad continuum emission , and a second pass when the detections are measured which fits for local fluctuations of the baseline in emission free channels over the region in which the spectral line flux is extracted .",
    "@xcite show that hi  flux densities measurements are typically not better than 15% .",
    "the mean difference between kat-7 and alfalfa hi  masses is 21% .",
    "however , there is not a simple universal offset .",
    "generally , the galaxies at the center of the kat-7 mosaic ( hcg  44 members and sdss  j1017 ) are underestimated in the kat-7 data compared to alfalfa , and the galaxies on the outskirts of the mosaic ( ngc  3177 , lsbc  f567 - 01 , and ugc  5574 ) , where the sensitivity of the kat-7 data are declining , are overestimated .",
    "one possible explanation is that a better primary beam model is required for kat-7 than the gaussian assumed by the casa software .",
    "a full model for the kat-7 primary beam is not currently available , but holography measurements of the individual dishes were taken as part of the commissioning process . in figure [ beam ]",
    "we present the amplitude beam measurement of antenna 1 stokes i for kat-7 compared to the gaussian primary beam used to correct the data .",
    "the engineering holography measurement has been arbitrarily scaled in the radial direction for comparison .",
    "we see that , indeed , it appears the gaussian will under correct flux close to the center of a pointing , and over correct the flux on the outskirts . for the antenna 1 measurement ,",
    "this difference is at the 2% level , but it may be greater when the entire array is considered together .",
    "a study of 22 hcgs , which included hcg  44 , provided evidence of a diffuse neutral gas intragroup medium present in some compact groups @xcite .",
    "however , based on follow - up mapping with the gbt , it was argued from the strong double - horned hi  profiles that the majority of hi  in hcg  44 is bound in stable disk - like structures @xcite .",
    "these observations covered the three main galaxies in hcg  44 : ngc  3185 , ngc  3187 , ngc  3190 ; and the nearby @xmath74 cloud , and found a total hi  mass of @xmath75  m@xmath3  but did not resolve the compact group .",
    "we measure @xmath76 m@xmath3  in hcg  44 , which is consistent with the total hi  mass resolved by wsrt @xcite .",
    "while the gbt observations appear to detect 22% more hi  in hcg  44 than either the kwa or wsrt observations , this seems to be within the variation measured for individual galaxies by different telescopes , even when those telescopes are sensitive to the same spatial scales .",
    "the gbt and alfalfa values are also consistent with the vla - d observations , which show the hi  is confined to individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that even with deeper hi  observations , there is no strong evidence for a diffuse , neutral igm in hcg  44 .",
    "hcg  44 is known to be highly hi  deficient , even when compared to other compact groups .",
    "the expected hi  mass for the group is calculated by summing the predicted values from the individual galaxies based on their morphological type @xcite and comparing them to the sum of the observed hi  masses : @xmath77-\\log[\\sigma m(hi)_{\\text{obs}}]$ ] .",

    "@xcite point out that the deficiency in hcg  44 is not due to a few highly anemic objects , but is a characteristic shared by all the members .",
    "this argues that the group members have evolved together to account for the high hi  deficiency , and against a single interloper which has had its gas completely removed .",
    "the most probable effect produced by tidal interactions is believed to be disk stripping @xcite .",
    "the role of ram - pressure stripping in compact groups has been shown to be small , only capable of removing small amounts of cold gas @xcite , however , turbulent viscous stripping due to hydrodynamical interactions may also be an important mechanism for removing gas from compact group members @xcite .",
    "the advantage of low surface brightness sensitivity and wide field of view of our observations are apparent in observing the hi  tail , @xmath14 , where we find @xmath1390% more hi  than the wsrt observations alone .",
    "however , the most striking result of our observations is detecting and resolving the gas beyond @xmath14 .",
    "the extended tail is resolved into 7 - 8 distinct knots , and the total hi  mass is of the order observed in a typical galaxy : @xmath2  m@xmath3 . nonetheless , even including the extended tail , the total gas content of the hcg  44 system only adds up to @xmath80=9.52\\pm0.1 $ ] and can not account for the observed hi  depletion of the compact group .",

    "while hi  is invaluable for recognizing a history of past interactions , disentangling the chain of events is more complicated .",
    "the origin of the extended hi  tail associated with hcg  44 is no less mysterious .",
    "@xcite ruled out the likelihood that the tail is the result of ram pressure from the lack of diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the authors discussed two possible scenarios .",
    "first , the gas was pulled out from ngc  3162 in a close passage with the compact group .",
    "the elongated morphology of @xmath14 and the hipass detection suggest a tenuous connection between the tail and ngc  3162 , which lies approximately 620 kpc northwest of hcg  44 and the same distance from cloud 2 of the tail .",
    "second , the gas originated from one of the galaxies currently within hcg  44 that has interacted with the group gravitational potential .",
    "within hcg  44 both the stellar and resolved hi  component of ngc  3187 show a strong s - shaped distortion ( figure [ wise ] and the wsrt contours in figure [ mom0 ] ) suggesting a strong tidal interaction .",
    "meanwhile , in sdss optical images ngc  3190 has a strong dust lane with a swept - back morphology looking as though it has passed from the direction of @xmath14 , and the galaxy has strong infrared h@xmath6 emission which has been attributed to shocked gas @xcite .    an outstanding question has been whether @xcite catch a glimpse of the high column density gas in an hi  bridge which connects @xmath14 to the compact group .",
    "if such a bridge exists , it should be visible in both our kat-7 and combined images in the most sensitive region of the cubes .",
    "a connection would add weight to the second origin scenario , and we could trace from which hcg  44 member galaxy the gas was stripped .",
    "we went through a concerted effort to uncover such a bridge , going through multiple iterations of targeted cleaning of the kat-7 cube during the imaging process , inspecting cubes at all stages of post - processing , including the kat-7 cube , the final data cube described in section [ combo ] , the spatially smoothed cube used for masking , and previous versions of the cubes at higher velocity resolution .",
    "finally we inspected position - velocity slices of the cubes at various angles from ngc  3190 and ngc  3187 towards the high column density clumps of @xmath14 .",
    "ultimately , we confirm faint continuous emission between cloud 1 and cloud 2 of @xmath14 , which makes up the southern extension , but we found no convincing evidence for an hi  bridge connecting @xmath14 to any of the hcg  44 members at our detection limits ( e.g.  figure [ pvmap2 ] ) .",
    "the gap in hi  emission between @xmath14 and hcg  44 may be explained if the h@xmath6 emission in ngc  3190 is not the result of shocked gas due to collisions with tidal debris , but comes from the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; @xcite ) due to jet - interstellar medium ( ism ) interactions @xcite .",
    "the orientation of ngc  3190 is such that ionizing radiation emanating from the nucleus would have a clear path in the direction of where a bridge between hcg  44 and @xmath14 would exist .",
    "thus , it is possible that we do not detect an hi  bridge because it has been blown out or ionized , similar to gaps seen in hi  tidal features such as around ngc  520 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , images from alfalfa which cover a larger area of sky show increasing evidence for a connection between the extended tail and ngc  3162 @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious that the gas must have originated from ngc  3162 because there is still a gap in the observed hi  distribution between the tail and ngc  3162 .",
    "however , we note that the morphology of the extended tail is consistent with that of gas pulled out of galaxies in other high velocity encounters ( @xmath86  kms ) , such as virgohi  21 near ngc  4254 @xcite . in these simulations , the hi  tidal tails that form",
    "are long , narrow , and have a low stellar content .",
    "there are further considerations , although it is unclear as to how they should be interpreted .",
    "first , the tail is resolved into clumps and does not have a large velocity gradient as is seen in the @xcite simulations , although the latter may be projection effects .",
    "second , the most massive hi  clouds are those furthest from ngc  3162 , and closest to hcg  44 .",
    "the most massive clouds to result from a tidal interaction are likely those pulled out near periastron , where tidal forces are the greatest .",
    "third , the tail is the messiest to the southeast , close to hcg  44 .",
    "this could be because the gas originated within the compact group , or if the tidal tail was pulled out from ngc  3162 it is now interacting with the compact group . finally , we note that ngc  3162 does not suffer from hi  deficiency @xcite , although the uncertainty in expected hi  mass for a galaxy of a given morphology and diameter is enough that we can not rule out ngc  3162 as the donor .    in any case , it is probable that multiple interactions have occurred in the system .",
    "a third scenario is that multiple interactions within the compact group loosened the cold gas of the galactic ism and allowed it to form a long tail in a high speed encounter with ngc  3162 , as modeled by @xcite .",
    "the internal interactions shake up the hi  gas which is then not bound as tightly in the shallow group potential , and would also account for the disturbed morphology of ngc  3190",
    ". the overall hi  deficiency of galaxies in the compact group would be the result of their history of group membership and gas depletion through star formation and gas processing , as proposed in other group environments by @xcite or @xcite . if the gas in the extended tail originated in an hcg  44 galaxy , it has not had to travel as far from its starting point as if it originated in ngc  3162 . in short , we present a number of possible scenarios for the origin of the extended tail , but the kwa data presented here is unable to say conclusively which is correct .      despite the uncertainty in its origin",
    ", we investigate the possible fate of the hi  tail .",
    "our data shows that it has a clumpy distribution with 7 - 8 knots of emission .",
    "if we consider each knot as a distinct hi  cloud , we note that the clouds with the highest peak column density and greatest velocity dispersion are the easternmost clumps of the tail .",
    "tidal interactions are known to sometimes produce knots of star formation in stripped gas , and if these structures are self - gravitating , they are referred to as tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite . assuming the clouds are spherical , and the observed velocity dispersion is the thermal velocity of the gas , we can test to see if they will collapse .",
    "the easternmost knot is @xmath87  m@xmath3  and has a velocity dispersion of @xmath88  kms@xmath18 .",
    "the jeans length is @xmath89 kpc .",
    "the wsrt appears to resolve this cloud to the size of 5 arcminutes which corresponds to 36 kpc ( figure [ mom0 ] , or figure 2 in @xcite ) so it is unlikely that stars are forming out of gas in the tail .",
    "additionally , despite deep images from cfht / megacam with a limiting surface brightness sensitivity of @xmath1328.5 mag arcsec@xmath90 in g - band @xcite , there is no known stellar component in the optical , and nothing evident in wise infrared imaging ( figure [ wise ] ) .",
    "if stars were pulled out of the galaxy concurrently with the gas , they would be broadly dispersed and potentially undetectable @xcite .",
    "searches for planetary nebula line emission as a tracer for intragroup stellar light , conclude an upper limit of only 5% for the diffuse light fraction within hcg  44 itself @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we may investigate cloud survival in the context of photoionization .",
    "observations have shown that both the outer disks of galaxies and tidal debris are protected from the ionizing ultraviolet ( uv ) background if the gas is above a few @xmath91  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "radiative transfer modeling suggests that clouds can survive in the intergalactic medium if they have a column density of at least @xmath92 @xmath1 @xcite . in our total intensity map ( figure [ mom0 ] )",
    "the extended envelope of gas in the hi  tail is closer to @xmath40 @xmath1 or less , but this may be an underestimate since the clouds themselves are largely unresolved .",
    "the peak column density of clouds 2 and 3 are @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "@xcite point out that a 1 kpc cloud with an ism density of 1 atom  @xmath95 expanding at 20  kms@xmath18  would survive for @xmath13500 myr before dropping to a density susceptible to photoionization by the uv background .",
    "however , if the density of the igm is of order a few to tens @xmath96 @xmath95 the cold hi  clouds will reach pressure equilibrium before reaching the critical column density , and may survive longer .",
    "these igm densities have been inferred indirectly through the morphology of bent jets in galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "we find that both the column density and velocity dispersion of the hi  clouds decrease as one moves along the tail from east to west ( see figure [ pvmap ] and section [ hitail ] ) .",
    "if we consider that the gas has been pulled out of ngc  3187 , as in @xcite s 3d toy model , and/or ngc  3190 , the clouds may represent snapshots of evolution at different times after they have been pulled out of the galaxy . in this case",
    "the hi  clouds become fainter as they disperse and the velocity dispersion decreases as what remains is the cold core of the cloud .",
    "our extrapolation of the proposed trajectory from the 3d model implies that the easternmost hi  clouds were stripped of order 500 , 600 , and 700 myr ago .",
    "further , the clouds in the extended tail fall at intervals which would imply they were stripped approximately 850 , 1000 , and 1100 myr in the past .",
    "these lifetimes suggest that intragroup hi  clouds may have survived by being contained in pressure equilibrium with a warm intragroup medium that has not been directly detected , and which may extend out to quite large distances beyond the compact group  perhaps as part of the larger gh58 or ngc  3190 loose group to which hcg  44 apparently belongs @xcite .    alternatively",
    ", we can make a simple estimate of the required survival time of the clouds if they are a result of a close encounter with ngc  3162 .",
    "ngc  3162 lies at a projected distance of 620 kpc from hcg  44 , and at relative fly - by velocities of @xmath97kms@xmath18 , the clouds would have had to survive between 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "the lower velocity limit seems challenging , given the long required lifetime of the clouds in the igm .",
    "meanwhile , the high velocity limit has been shown to produce long tidal tails in cluster systems , but may be unusually high for a galaxy group system with few members and an otherwise narrow velocity dispersion ( 115 - 220  kms@xmath18  depending on what is considered part of the group ; @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    simulations of small hi  clouds survival in a milky way - like hot ( @xmath98 k ; @xmath99",
    "@xmath95 ) halo suggest that neutral hi  which has been stripped can last of order 80200 myr before it is disrupted or ionized @xcite .",
    "the hi  clouds of these simulations have a range of mass from ( @xmath100  m@xmath3 ) , but @xcite summarizes that total mass seems to be one of the largest factors which increase their lifetime .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations also include the effects of ram pressure stripping , in addition to photoionization .",
    "if the effects of ram pressure are less severe on the hcg  44 intragroup clouds @xcite , perhaps they are able to live longer .",
    "if they have already lived in the igm for 1 gyr , they probably started with a larger initial mass than what we currently observe .",
    "hi  is a key tracer of physical mechanisms at work in galaxy groups as the gas is both the most extended component of pristine galaxies , and also most easily removed through gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions .",
    "it can provide rigorous constraints on galaxy - galaxy interactions , group dynamics , and indirect evidence of the warm - hot igm which remains otherwise undetected .",
    "tidally stripped hi  in groups appears to survive as both filamentary structures and a diffuse component @xcite .",
    "this gas can provide a reservoir for re - accretion through so - called  rejuvenation events \" , but collisions with this intragroup medium may also produce shocks in the interstellar medium of galaxies @xcite .",
    "associated shock heating may lead to further stripping , or the formation of molecular hydrogen through gas compression at the leading edge of the shock@xcite . to date",
    "the preponderance and evolutionary effects of these processes remain relatively unexplored and poorly understood . in hcg  44 ,",
    "if previously detected h@xmath6  is the result of shocks due to collisions with the igm , the intragroup medium doing the work remains undetected in our deep hi  data . on the other hand ,",
    "if the h@xmath6  emission is due to jet - ism interaction shocks from an agn in ngc  3190 , it may explain the absence of an hi  bridge between hcg  44 and the extended hi  tail .",
    "qualitative analytical arguments for hi  cloud survival have estimated cold cloud lifetimes of 500 myr once gas has been removed from a galaxy disk @xcite . however , if the orbit of ngc  3187 modeled by @xcite is representative of a group member interacting with the hcg  44 group potential , the hi  clouds at the end of the extended tail may have already survived for up to 1 gyr . if the gas originated in ngc  3162 , the clouds have lived in the circumgroup medium for 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "this result warrants further simulation to understand how the balance of physical processes between the cloud and the circumgroup medium allows for cloud survival .",
    "unfortunately , the warm - hot intragroup medium has thus far evaded direct detection so the density and temperature of the intragroup medium is constrained more by what we do not see than what we do ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , our result demonstrates the potential of hi  to provide even stronger constraints on the modeling of galaxy group properties .",
    "future wide - area hi  surveys ( e.g. wallaby , dingo , mightee - hi , and apertif surveys ) will uncover many more nearby hi  rich groups for deep follow - up . a number of preliminary results from deep kat-7 observations ( oosterloo et al , in prep ; lucero , private communication ) and from askap @xcite ,",
    "show that extended and low - surface brightness hi  features may be even more common in galaxy groups than previously realized .",
    "tidal interactions produce material that lead to viscous stripping of the interstellar medium from galaxies , and this process may be important in loose groups in addition to compact groups .",
    "finally , with the expected increase in the gas fraction of galaxies as one moves to higher redshift , group interactions may play an even more significant role in the evolution of galaxies in the past than what is seen locally . in other words , the effect of environment when galaxies were typically gas - rich ( @xmath101 ) may be a key consideration at a time when the universe was experiencing elevated star formation and more efficiently building stellar mass compared to local systems .",
    "we observed the region around hcg  44 and the giant hi  tail discovered by @xcite , which extends to the north and west of the compact group , to investigate the extent of intragroup hi .",
    "we combined a deep two - pointing mosaic from kat-7 with imaging from the alfalfa survey , and a single pointing observation of wsrt . despite the very different nature of the telescopes , we successfully combined the data by converting the image units of jy beam@xmath18 to column density per unit velocity , atoms @xmath1(kms@xmath18)@xmath18 , weighting by the sensitivity of the respective observations , and adding them in the image plane .",
    "we find no evidence for copious amounts of neutral hi  in the igm within the core of the compact group , which suggests the h@xmath6  emission observed by @xcite in ngc  3190 may be the result of agn activity and jet - ism interaction rather than shocked gas from ngc  3190 plunging through the igm .",
    "the presence of an agn , or star formation in the nucleus of ngc  3190 could account for the lack of an hi  bridge between hcg  44 and the hi  tail , if hcg  44 is where the extended hi  tail originated from .",
    "the combined hi  data show that the hi  tail extends out to at least 450 kpc and is resolved into 78 clouds at the resolution of kat-7 .",
    "we find more hi  mass in all parts of the tail as compared to previous wsrt observations , such that the total hi  mass in the tail is @xmath2  m@xmath3 .",
    "however , the gas in the tail is still not able to account for the overall hi  depletion in the compact group . the remaining gas is either too diffuse to be measured with current facilities , or more likely",
    "has been ionized and may exist in a warm - hot group halo that is also undetected in x - rays .",
    "we find that if the gas in the tail is stripped from one of the hcg  44 member galaxies , and the timescale for stripping proposed in @xcite is correct , the gas must have been able to live in the intragroup medium without being ionized for 0.5 - 1 gyr , which is longer than previously predicted . if the gas originated in ngc  3162 , it must have been produced in a high speed encounter , and even then must have survived in the igm for well more than 1 gyr .",
    "regardless of the origins of the hi  tail , our results demonstrate indirect evidence for a surrounding medium which has confined the expansion of the hi  clouds and prevented their destruction by background uv radiation .",
    "targeted simulations are required to explain how these hi  clouds can survive for long periods of time in the igm .",
