    "k dwarfs are long - lived stars and can be regarded as snapshots of the stellar populations formed at different times over the history of our galaxy , therefore constituting an optimal tool for any study dealing with its chemical evolution ( e.g. kotoneva et al . 2002 ) .",
    "k dwarfs share a similar metallicity distribution with the g dwarfs , in which most stars have metallicities around the solar value , a feature not expected in the simplest , closed - box models of galactic chemical evolution ( i.e. the g - dwarf problem ) . in addition to the abundance patterns of metals in a stellar population , the helium content @xmath2 can also diagnose its chemical evolution , but this diagnostic has received less attention because measuring the helium content of low mass stars can only be done indirectly ( e.g. jimenez et al . 2003 ) .",
    "typically , one measures a differential production rate of the helium mass fraction @xmath2 in the stellar population relative to the metal mass fraction @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 . for the solar neighbourhood , jimenez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) determine @xmath5 from k dwarfs , a value similar to that found by studying h  ii regions in both the milky way and external galaxies ( e.g. balser 2006 ) .",
    "metals mainly come from supernovae with high - mass progenitors , whereas helium is also injected into the interstellar medium by mass - loss from intermediate and low mass stars : @xmath0 can thus be computed from stellar evolutionary theory for a given initial mass function ( e.g. chiosi & matteucci 1982 ; maeder 1992 , 1993 ; chiappini , renda & matteucci 2002 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 can also be used to infer the primordial helium abundance @xmath6 by extrapolating to @xmath7 ; the technique is usually applied to extragalactic h  ii regions  the k dwarfs studied here provide an independent check on @xmath6 .",
    "cosmic microwave background measurements alone are not able to provide a tight constraint in @xmath6 ( trotta & hansen 2004 ) , but wmap3 data on the cosmic baryon density when combined with standard big bang nucleosynthesis returns a formally accurate value for @xmath6 ( see section [ heres ] ) .",
    "finally , age determinations for both resolved and integrated stellar populations typically assume a value for @xmath4 , and accurately knowing the age of galaxies can , in turn , help to determine the nature of dark energy ( jimenez & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "helium lines are not easily detectable in the spectra of low mass stars , with the notable exception of hot horizontal branch objects , whose atmospheres are , however , affected by gravitational settling and radiative levitation , which strongly alter the initial chemical stratification ( e.g. michaud , vauclair & vauclair 1983 ; moehler et al .",
    "1999 ) and whose composition anyway would not reflect the original helium abundance at their birth .",
    "therefore , assumptions have to be made for the initial helium content of models of low - mass stars . very often , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", it is supposed that the metallicity @xmath3 and helium fraction @xmath2 are related through a constant ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is often determined from the result of the solar calibration @xmath8 and for any other star of known metallicity , the helium abundance is scaled to the solar one as @xmath9 . most of the conclusions drawn when comparing theoretical isochrones with binaries ( e.g. torres et al .",
    "2002 ; torres & ribas 2002 ; lacy et al . 2005 ; torres et al .",
    "2006 ; boden , torres & latham 2006 ; henry et al . 2006 ) and field stars ( e.g. allende prieto & lambert 1999 ; valenti & fischer 2005 ) thus reflect this tacit assumption on the helium content .",
    "recent results , however suggest that the naive assumption that @xmath10 varies linearly and with a universal law might not be correct .",
    "for example , the hyades seem to be @xmath2 deficient for their metallicity ( perryman et al .",
    "1998 ; lebreton , fernandes & lejeune 2001 ; pinsonneault et al .",
    "the discovery that the globular cluster @xmath11  cen has at least two different components of the main sequence and multiple turnoffs ( lee et al .",
    "1999 ; pancino et al . 2000 , 2002 ; ferraro et al . 2004 ; bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) can be explained assuming stellar populations with very different helium abundances ( norris 2004 ) and thus very different @xmath4 .",
    "recently , compelling evidence has been found for a helium spread among the main sequence in the globular clusters ngc 2808 ( dantona et al . 2005a ) and the blue horizontal branch stars in the globular cluster ngc 6441 ( caloi & dantona 2007 ) . at the same time , for a different sample of galactic globular clusters salaris et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a very homogeneous value of @xmath2 with practically no helium abundance evolution over the entire metallicity range spanned by their study .",
    "all this suggests that a patchy variation of @xmath12 and complex chemical evolution histories might be not so unusual in our galaxy .",
    "similar indications also start to appear for extragalactic objects ( kaviraj et al .",
    "there are various methods to infer the helium content in globular clusters ( e.g. sandquist 2000 ) and all take advantage of the fact that in these objects it is relatively easy to perform statistical analysis over large stellar populations .",
    "the determination of the helium content in nearby field stars , on the contrary , is more challenging , because it is less straightforward to build a statistically large and homogeneously selected sample .",
    "accurate parallaxes are needed and to avoid subtle reddening corrections only stars closer than @xmath13  pc must be used .",
    "all studies to date have exploited the fact that the broadening of the lower main sequence with metallicity effectively depends on the helium content ( see section [ method ] ) so that its width can be used to put constraints on @xmath0 ( e.g. faulkner 1967 ; perrin et al .",
    "1977 ; fernandes , lebreton & baglin 1996 ; pagel & portinari 1998 ; jimenez et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in this work we take the same strategy , comparing the positions of a large sample of field stars with theoretical isochrones in the @xmath14 plane . for the parameter space covered by the isochrones ,",
    "the number of stars used , the accuracy and the homogeneity of the observational data ( crucial when it comes to analyzing small differential effects in the hr diagram ) , this is the most extensive and stringent test on the helium content of lower main sequence stars undertaken to date .",
    "an analogous work was pioneered by perrin et al .",
    "( 1977 ) with 138 nearby fgk stars but with much less accurate fundamental stellar parameters , pre-_hipparcos _ parallaxes and of course , older stellar models . after _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes become available , the problem was re - addressed by lebreton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with a sample of 114 nearby fgk stars in the metallicity range @xmath15 } < 0.3 $ ] , of which only 33 have @xmath16 and @xmath17 determined directly via the infrared flux method ( hereafter irfm ) of alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996a ) . for the remaining stars , temperatures were either recovered via spectroscopic methods or color indices and @xmath18 determined from the bolometric corrections of alonso ( 1995 , 1996b ) .",
    "we have recently carried out a detailed empirical determination of fundamental stellar parameters via irfm ( casagrande , portinari & flynn 2006 ) with the specific task of determining the helium content in dwarf stars by comparing them to theoretical isochrones .",
    "our sample is similar in size to previous studies , but i ) it has a larger metallicity coverage ii ) we have improved the accuracy in the selection ( see section [ sample ] ) , iii ) we have carefully and homogeneously determined the fundamental stellar parameters iv ) focusing particularly on stars ( k dwarfs ) where the helium content can be most directly determined from the stellar structure models , since the effects of stellar evolution play an insignificant role .",
    "stellar models are common ingredients in a variety of studies addressing fundamental cosmological and astrophysical problems , from ages and evolution of galaxies , to complex stellar populations , to exoplanets .",
    "nevertheless , our incomplete understanding of complex physical processes in stellar interior requires the introduction of free parameters that are calibrated to the sun .",
    "therefore , using main sequence nearby stars with accurate fundamental parameters to test the adequacy of extant stellar models is of paramount importance to validate their range of applicability ( lebreton 2000 ) , as we do here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sample ]",
    "we describe our sample and in section [ theory ] we present our theoretical isochrones and how they compare to observations . in section [ method ]",
    "we delve into the derivation of the helium abundance for lower main sequence stars and in section [ notguilty ] we carefully analyze how the results depend on the assumptions made in stellar models .",
    "the applicability range of our results is obtained by comparing the prediction of the isochrones to a congruous set of main sequence binaries ( section [ bitest ] ) and to empirical mass - luminosity relations ( section [ masslum ] ) .",
    "we suggest that an accurate mass - luminosity relation for metal poor dwarfs could actually put constraints on their helium content . in section [ swp ]",
    "we apply our method to derive masses and helium abundances for a small set of planet host stars .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "our sample stems from the 104 gk dwarfs for which we computed accurate effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities via irfm ( casagrande et al .",
    "2006 ) . for such stars accurate [ @xmath19/fe ] ratios and overall metallicities",
    "[ m / h ] are available from spectroscopy as described in more details in casagrande et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "the main metallicity parameter in theoretical models is in fact the total heavy - element abundance [ m / h ] and neglecting the @xmath19 enhancement can lead to erroneous or biased conclusions ( gallart , zoccali & aparicio 2005 ) . once [ m / h ] is known , the metal mass fraction @xmath3 can be readily computed ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we also paid special attention to removing unresolved double / multiple and variable stars as described in full detail in casagrande et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "some of the stars in the sample were too bright to have accurate 2mass photometry and therefore the irfm could not be applied .",
    "however , such stars have excellent @xmath20 photometry so that from these colours it was possible to recover the effective temperature and bolometric flux by means of the multi - band calibrations given in casagrande et al . ( 2006 ) , homogeneously with the rest of the sample . in this manner",
    "twenty - three single ( or well separated binary ) and non variable stars were added to the sample . for these additional stars @xmath16 and @xmath21",
    "have been estimated averaging the values returned by the calibrations in all @xmath20 bands .",
    "the standard deviation resulting from the values obtained in different bands has been adopted as a measure of the internal accuracy .",
    "the systematics due to the adopted absolute calibration ( figure 12 in casagrande et al .",
    "2006 ) have then been added to obtain the overall errors .",
    "when helium abundances for these additional stars are computed ( section [ method ] ) , the resulting values are perfectly in line with those obtained for stars with fundamental parameters obtained via irfm .",
    "we remark that an accurate estimate of the absolute luminosity ( or magnitude ) of each star requires parallax accuracy at the level of a few percent",
    ". a possible limitation could be the lutz & kelker ( 1973 ) bias , however , as we discuss in appendix b , when limiting our sample to parallaxes better than 6% the bias is negligible compared to other uncertainties .",
    "this requirement on the parallaxes reduces our sample to 105 stars ( see figure [ best ] ) .",
    "we derive the helium content of our stars indirectly by comparing their positions in the theoretical hr diagram with respect to a set of isochrones of different helium and metallicity content ( see section [ method ] ) .",
    "if evolutionary effects have already taken place in stars , the comparison would be age dependent ( see section [ theory ] ) .",
    "however , for any reasonable assumption about the stellar ages , one can safely assume that all stars fainter than @xmath22 are practically unaffected by evolution and lie close to their zero age main sequence ( zams ) location ( e.g. fernandes et al .",
    "1996 ; pagel & portinari 1998 ; jimenez et al . 2003 ) . in terms of @xmath18",
    "the threshold is very similar ( see figure 17 in casagrande et al .",
    "2006 ) so that we assume @xmath23 as a conservative estimate : this reduces the sample to 86 k dwarfs .    for consistency with casagrande et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , throughout the paper we assume @xmath24 and @xmath25  erg @xmath26 .",
    "several effects are responsible for the observed width of the lower main sequence : among the physical ones are chemical composition , evolution and rotation whereas observational errors and undetected binarity among stars are spurious ones .",
    "we have carefully cleaned our sample from spurious effects ( casagrande et al .",
    "2006 ) so here we discuss only the physical ones related to stellar structure .",
    "the cut in absolute magnitudes adopted for our sample ( section [ sample ] ) ensures that our stars have masses below solar .",
    "the location of the main sequence depends on the treatment of convection and the size of core convective regions only for stars with @xmath27 and on rotation for stars with @xmath28 ( e.g. fernandes et al . 1996 ) so these effects and the related theoretical uncertainties are of no concern to us",
    ".    it is known that young and fast rotating k dwarfs might exhibit color anomalies such as to alter their location on the hr diagram ( e.g. stauffer et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , as we discuss in section [ blue ] this is not of concern to us .    with typical masses",
    "@xmath29 k dwarfs have lifetimes much longer than the present age of the galactic disk ( e.g. jimenez , flynn & kotoneva 1998 ) and comparable to the present age of the universe ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) so that evolutionary effects do not need to be taken into account . for a given metallicity @xmath3 , an increase of @xmath2",
    "makes a given mass on the isochrone hotter and brighter so that the net result of varying @xmath0 is to affect the broadening of the lower main sequence ( see figures [ best ] and [ tehe ] ) . such behaviour can be explained in terms of quasi - homology relations ( an increase of @xmath2 in fact decreases the mean opacity and increases the mean molecular weight e.g. cox & giuli 1968 ; fernandes et al .",
    "1996 ) and it has been exploited by pagel & portinari ( 1998 ) and more recently by jimenez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to put constraints on the local @xmath0 .",
    "we have computed a series of stellar models , using the padova code as in salasnich et al .",
    "since our sample includes only dwarfs , the evolutionary tracks are limited to the main sequence phase only .",
    "we consider a range of metallicities from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and a range of @xmath32 between 0 and 6 .",
    "metal abundance ratios are taken from grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "the solar metallicity is fixed to be @xmath33 , which is the value preferred by bertelli et al .",
    "( in preparation ) to whom we refer for all details . with this @xmath34 ,",
    "the model that reproduces the present solar radius and luminosity at an age of 4.6 gyr was found to have @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "these numbers imply @xmath37 which is slightly below the 0.0245 ratio quoted by grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "the difference between the adopted @xmath37 and the grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) ratio simply implies a shift in the zero - point of the solar calibration ( from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) and it is of no concern as long as we are interested in the study of a differential quantity such as @xmath40 . the adopted choice of @xmath41 when combined with the latest @xmath6 measurements ( section [ heres ] ) formally returns a @xmath0 in the range @xmath42 .",
    "our choice is to have a solar model that fits well the solar position in the hr diagram ( figure [ solar ] ) , and is by no means intended to be an accurate re - calibration .",
    "the latter would in fact be possible only by including atomic diffusion in the solar model .",
    "although in the sun atomic diffusion is efficient , spectroscopic observations of stars in galactic globular clusters and field halo stars ( see discussion in section [ difsec ] ) point to a drastically reduced efficiency of diffusion .",
    "for this reason , the effect of atomic diffusion is usually not included in the computation of large model grids ( e.g. pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ; vandenberg , bergbusch , dowler 2006 ) and the same approach is adopted here .",
    "range @xmath43  dex around the solar value .",
    "in order to have conservatively small errors we have used only stars with parallaxes better than 3% .",
    "transformations to plot the solar isochrone in the observational plane as discussed in section [ obstheo ] .",
    "overplotted is also the sun ( @xmath44 ) for which we have adopted colours and temperatures from casagrande et al .",
    "the difference with the empirical @xmath45 of holmberg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in unnoticeable .",
    "interestingly in the theoretical plane there is a much tighter agreement between model and observations . ]",
    "we also remark that the solar model is presently under profound revision after the updates in the estimated solar abundances ( asplund , grevesse & sauval , 2005 ) significantly diminish the agreement with helioseismology ( e.g. basu & antia 2004 ; antia & basu 2005 ; delahaye & pinsonneault 2006 ) .",
    "the present study however refers the `` classic '' solar model and metallicity as the zero - point calibration , and since the method relies on differential effects along the main sequence we do not expect that conclusions on @xmath46 , which is a _ differential _",
    "quantity , are significantly affected . also ,",
    "as already pointed out , the solar zero - point should be regarded as a calibration parameter and not as an absolutely determined value so that strong inferences on _ absolute _ values ( among which @xmath6 ) can hardly be drawn .",
    "therefore , as we will see later , small errors in this calibration procedure , and especially in @xmath47 , are unlikely to affect our conclusions on the @xmath0 obtained for our sample of stars . nonetheless , we caution on the hazardous comparison between the helium abundances deduced from the isochrones and external constraints such as the primordial helium abundance obtained with other techniques . in this case ,",
    "in fact , differences in the zero - point of @xmath41 does not cancel out anymore .",
    "we will return on the topic in section [ heres ] .",
    "the tracks computed cover the mass range between 0.15 and 1.5 @xmath48 , which is far wider than needed for an analysis of our sample .",
    "regarding convection , we adopt the same prescription as in girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) : convective core overshooting is assumed to occur for stars with @xmath49 , with an efficiency @xmath50 ( see bressan et al .",
    "1993 for the definition of @xmath51 ) that increases linearly with mass in the interval from 1 to 1.5 @xmath48 .",
    "lower mass stars are computed assuming the classical schwarzschild criterion .    from these tracks , we can construct isochrones in the hr diagram for arbitrary ages , and any intermediate @xmath52 relation , via simple linear interpolations within the grid of tracks .",
    "although our analysis is conducted using padova isochrones , we have fully cross checked ( section [ method ] ) the results with an updated set of the macdonald isochrones ( jimenez & macdonald 1996 ; jimenez et al . 2003 ) computed for a similar grid of values in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we have also compared our isochrones with other sets in the lower main sequence , namely the teramo ( cordier et al .",
    "2007 ) and yonsei  yale ( demarque et al . 2004 ) isochrones .",
    "the solar isochrone of each set is calibrated to reproduce the current position of the sun in the hr diagram but the values of @xmath41 and @xmath53 are not identical , because of the different prescriptions and input physics implemented in various independent codes . as we have already pointed out ,",
    "what matters is not the comparison between absolute values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a meaningful comparison can only be done between isochrones of similar @xmath0 with respect to a common calibration point i.e. with respect to the solar isochrone .",
    "it is clear from figure [ pty ] that different set of isochrones are in general in good agreement .",
    "the agreement between padova and yale isochrones is outstanding throughout the entire range of metallicities and @xmath18 covered in this study .",
    "the comparison with the teramo isochrones is also very good , except for the high metallicity isochrone that is significantly hotter in the teramo dataset . at lower metallicities ,",
    "the agreement with teramo isochrones is always good except for the most metal poor and fainter stars in our sample .",
    "however , at luminosity higher than @xmath54 and below @xmath55 the agreement between padova and teramo isochrones is always outstanding .",
    "a more detailed comparison is outside the purpose of the paper , but clearly our results are not significantly affected by the particular set of isochrones used ( see also figure [ yz ] ) .",
    "comparison between model isochrones and data is usually done in the observational colour  absolute magnitude hr diagram rather than in its theoretical @xmath16@xmath18 counterpart .",
    "however , the observational plane makes use of the information extracted only from a limited part of the entire spectral energy distribution of a star ( few thousands of @xmath56 in the case of broad band colours , see also section [ blue ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for such a comparison theoretical isochrones have to be converted into colours and magnitudes via model atmospheres , introducing further model dependence and uncertainties ( e.g. weiss & salaris 1999 ) .",
    "sometimes the hybrid @xmath16  absolute magnitude plane is used although it has almost the same limitations as the observational one ( the computation of absolute magnitudes from stellar models still requires the use of spectral libraries ) .",
    "in addition @xmath16 is rarely empirically and consistently determined for all the stars , more often depending on the adopted colour  temperature transformation or resulting from a collection of inhomogeneous sources in literature . as a result",
    ", a single theoretical isochrone produces different loci in the color  magnitude diagram when different color - temperature relations are applied ( e.g. pinsonneault et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "working in the purely theoretical plane has many advantages .",
    "first , it is possible to directly compare observations to physical quantities such as temperature and luminosity ( or equivalently @xmath18 ) predicted from stellar models . secondly , for the purpose of this work , the effects of helium are highlighted in the theoretical plane , whereas in the widely used @xmath57 vs @xmath58 plane they are partly degenerate with the dependence of the colour index on metallicity ( castellani , deglinnocenti & marconi 1999 ) . up to now , the drawback of working in the theoretical plane was that for a given set of stars , very rarely in literature homogeneous and accurate bolometric corrections and effective temperatures were available for large samples .",
    "however , for all our stars we have homogeneously derived @xmath16 and bolometric luminosity from accurate multi  band photometry and basing on the irfm ( section [ sample ] ) . in the case of k dwarfs @xmath5980% of the total luminosity is directly observed so that the dependence on model atmosphere is minimal in model atmospheres changes synthetic magnitudes by @xmath60 ( girardi et al .",
    "our implementation of the irfm relies on multi - band photometry and uses model atmospheres to estimate the missing flux only to a limited extent ( few tens of percent ) .",
    "our results are thus unaffected by this uncertainty . ] .",
    "the first feature that appears from the comparison between the observational @xmath57 and the theoretical hr diagram ( figure [ best ] ) is how in the @xmath61 plane the separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is not as neat as in the observational @xmath57 counterpart .",
    "this was already noticed by perrin et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and lebreton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and reflects the sensitivity of the @xmath62 colour indices to metallicity . to ensure this is not an artifact due to our temperature and/or luminosity scale",

    "errors in @xmath17 also account for the uncertainty in parallaxes .",
    "our results suggest that within the present day accuracy , planet host stars do not show any anomalous helium abundance with respect to other field stars in the same metallicity range .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that @xmath41 is recovered within @xmath72 from field stars ( table [ ratio ] ) . a kolmogorov - smirnov test for the helium content between stars with and without planets in the same metallicity range of table [ phs ] confirm that the two populations are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the number of available data points is still small , with large errorbars ; but we expect that in the near future , studies of planet host stars in the lower main sequence will improve on the robustness of this conclusion .",
    "most of the studies about exoplanets depend quite strongly on the physical properties ( mostly radius and mass ) of the planet host stars .",
    "such properties are usually obtained from the isochrones . in this study",
    "we have proven that at high metallicity ( i.e. around solar ) the isochrones can be used with some confidence . when our masses are compared to those obtained by santos et al .",
    "( 2004a ) interpolating isochrones with standard helium abundances , the agreement is usually good with a mean difference @xmath73 .",
    "we have compared a set of k dwarfs with accurate effective temperature @xmath16 , metallicity @xmath3 and luminosity @xmath17 to a grid of stellar theoretical isochrones , in order to indirectly determine the helium abundance @xmath2 in the stars .",
    "we then derive the helium - to - metal enrichment ratio @xmath74 in the solar neighbourhood .    for all our stars",
    "the fundamental physical parameters were derived empirically and homogeneously , with the specific aim of measuring small differential effects along the lower main sequence ( section [ sample ] ) .",
    "the isochrones used are among the most up - to - date , implementing the latest input physics and covering a large grid of @xmath75 values ; also , we have verified that , for similar @xmath75 content they compare very well to other recent sets ( yonsei - yale , teramo and macdonald ) and therefore our results do not depend significantly on the specific isochrones employed ( section [ padova ] ) .    while we derive reasonable values for helium content in our k dwarfs around solar metallicity , the isochrones yield very low values of helium in the metal poor k dwarfs . at metallicities around and above the solar ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 ( section [ heres ] ) , but at low metallicities , the match between the theoretical and observed main sequence is so poor .",
    "theoretical isochrones can be forced to fit metal poor stars only by assuming _ very low helium abundances _ , well below the primordial big - bang value ( section [ method ] ; figure [ yz ] ) .",
    "this result is quite puzzling .",
    "although different isochrone sets exhibit some differences in the derived helium content ( especially at the lowest metallicities and luminosities ) , very low helium abundances are already found for moderately metal poor and bright stars , where all the isochrones agree remarkably well . the size and homogeneity of the sample of stars , the accuracy in both empirical and theoretical data , together with the possibility of making the comparison directly in the @xmath61 plane , where the effect of the helium content are most evident , are the major improvements over similar work in the past .",
    "the helium discrepancy was known to exist ( lebreton et al .",
    "1999 )  the present sample greatly extends on previous work and appears to show that there is a clear problem in fitting stellar models to low mass , metal poor stars .",
    "lebreton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that adjustments in stellar models ( diffusion ) and observations ( nlte effects ) alleviate the problem but do not solve it , although their conclusions were based on a rather small number of stars .",
    "we also find that diffusion and nlte are unlikely to solve the problem completely .",
    "we rule out systematic errors in our metallicity scale or temperature scale as the culprit , since the systematic errors required would be much larger than our error estimates comfortably allow , and external checks indicate our other derived stellar physical parameters ( mass , luminosity and temperature ) are excellent .",
    "our very low helium abundances in the metal poor k dwarfs can be avoided via the ad hoc assumption that the mixing - length parameter decreases with decreasing metallicity for @xmath3 below solar ; this is of course a very major change to make to stellar models .",
    "interestingly , discrepancies between theory and observations for stars less massive than the sun have already been reported in the literature from the studies of binaries ( e.g. popper 1997 ; torres & ribas 2002 , see section [ bitest ] ) .",
    "however , such discrepancies in the range of k dwarfs have not yet caught in our opinion the attention they deserve , as most of the studies aiming to empirically measure mass - luminosity relations have preferentially focused on either earlier or later spectral types .",
    "we urge stellar model makers to reassess the modeling of low metallicity , lower main sequence stars .    as we have discussed in section [ bitest ] , accurate masses and fundamental physical parameters for metal poor dwarf binaries would be a powerful test of stellar models .",
    "the slope of the mass - luminosity relation in the metal poor regime could directly test the effect of diffusion ( section [ notguilty ] ) and be used to determine the helium abundance ( section [ masslum ] ) .",
    "low degree modes from space - based asteroseismology missions can be used to determine the helium abundance in stellar envelopes with an accuracy of 0.03 for a @xmath77 star ( basu et al .",
    "such accuracy is comparable to that in the present work .",
    "the study of such modes in metal poor dwarfs with on - going or forthcoming space missions like _ corot _ and _ kepler _ is therefore urged .",
    "theoretical isochrones are extensively used to determine the distance scale fitting the observed colour - magnitude diagram of globular clusters .",
    "metal poor isochrones with primordial , or close to primordial , helium abundance are used to infer their distance .",
    "however , our direct observations of nearby stars are challenging low metallicity isochrones : if extremely helium poor isochrones are formally needed to fit empirical data , this would stretch the ( isochrone - based ) distance scale by @xmath78 magnitudes ( but note that empirically calibrated distance scales based on nearby subdwarfs would remain unaffected ) .",
    "besides , assuming primordial helium for the metal poor population in such objects would imply , in a differential sense , extremely helium enhanced values for the metal rich counterparts .",
    "we stress that here we are not arguing that our very low helium abundances are real ; rather we attribute them to the current limits in stellar models .",
    "clearly direct parallaxes measurements for stars in globular clusters ( as _ gaia _ and _ sim _ will provide ) will shed new light on the problem .    in the meanwhile ,",
    "more studies for modeling low mass , metal poor stars are needed . at present , the impact of 3d model atmospheres on stellar abundance determinations is revolutionizing the field ; the solar model itself is under profound revision , and in coming years we expect many exciting breakthroughs .",
    "our study shows that at metallicities around and above solar , theoretical models are in good agreement with observations .",
    "this is of interest to studies of exoplanets , which are primarily around host stars of about the solar metallicity , since they still heavily depend on theoretical stellar models to constrain properties of the parent star .",

    "this returned an estimate of @xmath2 that was then used into equation ( [ correction ] ) and the newly computed metal mass fraction used for another interpolation over our grid of isochrones .",

    "the lutz  kelker bias on the absolute magnitude is in principle present at any level of parallax accuracy .",
    "the bias has two components , the first of which is statistical : since the number of stars increases with decreasing parallaxes ( i.e. larger distances and sampled volumes ) observational errors on the parallax will not cancel out exactly , giving a net effect of more stars with overestimated parallaxes .",
    "this makes the correction on the magnitudes of the individual stars statistical and dependent upon the properties of the sample .",
    "the second component of the bias arises because distances ( and hence absolute magnitudes ) are not linear functions of the parallaxes .",
    "even if errors have a normal distribution in parallax , they propagate to a skewed distribution in distance ( absolute magnitude ) .",
    "once again the effect is to favor more distant ( brighter ) stars to appear closer ( fainter ) .",
    "it is clear that this is a correction that has to be applied to the absolute magnitude of individual stars .    in recent literature",
    "there is a certain degree of confusion about what exactly is the lutz ",
    "kelker bias , whether any correction should be applied and , if so , how large it should be .",
    "the value of the corrections to be applied depends on the distribution of the true parallaxes @xmath92 . in principle",
    "the true parallax distribution could be derived by deconvolving the observed distribution for observational errors . in practice ,",
    "the deconvolution process is quite uncertain and most of the authors prefer to use analytical formulae for the correction .",
    "the most widely used is that of hanson ( 1979 ) , who gave analytical formulae relating absolute magnitude corrections to the proper motion distribution of the sample of stars .",
    "however , the use of such formulation is highly risky and it does not provide the necessary accuracy because of the strong dependence on the variety of input parameters . as recommended by brown et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in their paper on the properties of the _ hipparcos _ catalog , any correction should be tailored for each specific case .",
    "in fact , the blind use of hanson s formulation is often counterproductive as noticed already by many authors ( gratton et al .",
    "1997 ; sandage & saha 2002 ) . assuming a uniform density case , hanson s formulation can be used as an estimator for the worst - case scenario , but not as a correction for the bias .",
    "since the _ hipparcos _ catalog completeness decreases with increasing magnitude , the statistical correction is negligible .    on the other hand ,",
    "since we are dealing with the magnitude difference between individual stars and a reference isochrone , the correction for the skewed distribution is more relevant ( at least in principle ) .",
    "since magnitudes ( and distances ) are not linear functions of the parallax , one needs to resort to likelihood methods where the complete probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath11 given its uncertainties , is transformed into the corresponding distribution function for distance and magnitude . by means of such a method",
    "we prove the bias to be well within our observational errors .",
    "assuming a gaussian distribution for the errors around the measured parallax @xmath11 @xmath93 the expectation value for the distance @xmath94 is @xmath95= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\omega}}f\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}\\right ) \\textrm{d}\\tilde{\\omega}= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}g(\\tilde{\\omega})e^{\\frac{t(\\tilde{\\omega})}{{2\\sigma^2}}}\\textrm{d}\\tilde{\\omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . defining @xmath98 and expanding @xmath99 around the maxima of @xmath100 one",
    "gets the following series @xmath101 given the accuracy of our parallaxes , the condition @xmath102 for the expansion is certainly satisfied within , say , @xmath103 .",
    "the choice of the @xmath103 cutoff sounds perfectly reasonable for the purposes of our calculation .",
    "alternatively , a more rigorous approach has been investigated by smith & eichhorn ( 1996 ) .",
    "once the series expansion for @xmath99 is known , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) reads @xmath104=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n}\\left(\\frac{u}{\\omega}\\right)^n e^{-\\frac{u^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2 } } } \\textrm{d}u\\ ] ] and can easily be calculated by using gaussian integrals and noticing that odd terms vanish . the result is the following series @xmath104=\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n}n!}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega}\\right)^{2n}\\ ] ] and the amplitude of the bias @xmath104-\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\sim\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma } { \\omega}\\right)^{2}\\ ] ] can be easily checked to be negligible for our adopted accuracy in parallaxes ( 6% ) .    in the same manner we can give an estimate for the bias in absolute magnitudes @xmath105 in a given band @xmath106 or bolometric .",
    "we thus have @xmath107=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}g(\\tilde{\\omega})e^{\\frac{t(\\tilde{\\omega})}{{2\\sigma^2}}}\\textrm{d}\\tilde{\\omega},\\ ] ] where now , for a given apparent magnitude @xmath106 , we have @xmath108 hence the integral to be computed is @xmath107=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\big[\\xi+5\\log(\\omega)-10+\\ ] ] @xmath109=}5\\log(e)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\\left(\\frac{u}{\\omega}\\right)^{n}\\big]e^{-\\frac{u^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}}\\textrm{d}u\\ ] ] and gives the following bias @xmath107-m_{\\xi}=-5\\log(e)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(2n-1)!}{2^{n}n!}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega}\\right)^{2n}.\\ ] ] also for the absolute magnitudes the bias is negligible . at the first order the above equation",
    "gives @xmath107-m_{\\xi}=-\\frac{5}{2}\\log(e)\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega}\\right)^{2 } \\sim -0.004\\ ; \\textrm{mag}\\ ] ] in the case of lowest parallax accuracy and thus well within our observational errors .",
    "we finally note that given the high precision of our parallaxes ( @xmath110 ) a fully bayesian approach is not needed , also considering that it would require a priori assumptions on the parameter distributions .",
    "a bayesian approach is indeed demanded for lower precision parallaxes and it has been extensively studied by smith ( 1985 , 1987 , 2003 ) in his series of papers on the lutz  kelker bias ."
