    "the standard model of central engine of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) consists of a massive black hole , an accretion disk , and a distant molecular torus . a major problem , however , is the location of the source of x - ray emission not expected from this simple picture .",
    "x - ray emission carries a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity . in seyfert 1 galaxies it is mostly in the form of a hard x - ray power law component with the high energy cut - off at about 100 kev . in narrow line",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars the hard x - ray power law contains much lower fraction of the bolometric luminosity but there is a second component in those sources - large soft x - ray excess - which carries large fraction of the luminosity .",
    "this x - ray emission comes from a relatively compact region located not too far from the accretion disk , as suggested by the fast variability in x - ray band and the presence of x - ray reflection component .",
    "however , even the extensive monitoring campaigns did not solve yet the problem of exact geometry of this region and , subsequently , of the physical process leading to the formation of the hot plasma .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a particular model of the origin of this x - ray emission which is based on physical grounds .",
    "it is a model of a hot dissipative corona above an accretion disk , as described by janiuk & czerny ( 2000 ) .",
    "this model is based on assumptions that the corona is in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium with the disk , the rate of energy dissipation in the corona as well as in the disk is proportional to the pressure ( total pressure in the disk and gas pressure in the corona ) and the spontaneous division of the flow into disk and corona reflects the thermal instability within the irradiated gas , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this model predicts the overall shape of the spectrum optical / uv / x - ray from an accretion flow as a function of the mass of the black hole , an accretion rate and the viscosity parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce some modifications to the model and we compare it with the observational data .",
    "one of the source of difficulties in modeling agn is the fact that significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity is emitted in the unobserved region between far uv and soft x - rays so the bolometric luminosity and the spectral shape of the principal component - big blue bump - are poorly determined for a single object .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we decided to test the model against composite quasar spectra of @xcite which practically bridge the unobserved gap due to combining the spectra coming from objects at various redshifts .    in section  2",
    "we shortly describe the composite and a theoretical model .",
    "section  3 describes our results .",
    "we discuss the results in section  4 .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the mean spectra of radio quiet and radio loud quasars were shown by @xcite .",
    "they cover a broad frequency range @xmath2 , i.e. they extend from 15 000    up to 10 kev .",
    "the mean x - ray spectrum contains the spectra of objects from the bright quasar survey @xcite with redshift @xmath3 and column density @xmath4 .",
    "it was obtained adopting the following cosmological parameters : the hubble constant @xmath5 equal @xmath6 , the deceleration parameter @xmath7 , and the cosmological constant @xmath8 equal to @xmath9 .",
    "these low redshift objects determine the mean spectrum above @xmath10 ( 200 ev ) .",
    "below it we have the unobserved range due to the galactic absorption which extends from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "this range , however , is partially covered from @xmath13    to @xmath14    ( @xmath15 ) by spectrum from @xcite .",
    "this result is based on observations of quasars at high redshifts ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "final spectrum still contains a relatively short uncovered range",
    ". however , the simple extrapolation of the spectra from both sides roughly coincide which strongly suggest that the resulting spectra are a good representation of the broad band spectra of bright radio quiet and radio loud agn .",
    "we consider a model of stationary accretion flow onto a schwarzschild , massive black hole which consists of an accretion disk , a hot corona and ( optionally ) a spherically symmetric extended hot medium .",
    "the accretion is ultimately responsible for the emission of the radiation , and the energy is dissipated partially in the disk and partially in the corona .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate , @xmath17 , together with the mass of the central black hole , @xmath18 , are the basic parameters of our model ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total flux generated in the corona , @xmath19 , and in the disk , @xmath20 , is determined by the standard formula ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we approximate the distribution of the angular momentum in the disk and the corona by keplerian distribution @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18  the mass of the black hole and @xmath26 is radial radius of the object . the disk is the source of the soft photons , @xmath27 , which are comptonized locally in the corona and afterwards , at a greater distance , by the spherical cloud .",
    "the flux @xmath27 consists of a flux @xmath28 generated in the disk at any given radius is denoted by @xmath20 and of a fraction of the flux @xmath29 generated in the corona and subsequently intercepted and thermalised in the disk .",
    "this flux determines the effective temperature of the disk at a given radius @xmath30    the spectral shape of this radiation is sometimes approximated as a blackbody .",
    "however , when an electron scattering dominate significantly over free - free and bound - free absorption this assumption is not justified .",
    "if the number of scattering events is large the saturated comptonization effect is the most important and it shifts systematically the energy of photons while still preserving a black body spectral shape .",
    "@xcite showed that this is an important effect in agn accretion disks .",
    "we introduce the spectral hardening factor @xmath31 in such way that the flux can be described by the equation @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective temperature , @xmath34 is the color temperature , and @xmath35 is the planck function of blackbody .",
    "the value of @xmath31 should come in principle from the radiative transfer computations .",
    "however , the results of shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) were obtained assuming pure hydrogen and helium atmosphere while heavy elements ( particularly iron ) are very important . other codes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also contain several approximations , mostly concerning the description of bound - free transitions and lines of heavy elements which are essential .",
    "it is therefore more convenient to parameterize this effect , compare the results to the data and a posteriori conclude which theoretical predictions are most appropriate .",
    "this effect is particularly important in the innermost part of the disk where the ionization is the highest but it should become negligible further out .",
    "therefore we assume that the spectral hardening factor @xmath31 is the monotically decreasing function .",
    "it decreases from the value @xmath36 at the marginally stable orbit radius to the value @xmath37 further away , at @xmath26 larger than @xmath38 .",

    "x - ray photons irradiating the disk are partially absorbed and thermalised , contributing to @xmath27 , and partially reflected by the disk surface , depending on the value of the x - ray albedo , @xmath46 .",
    "we assume in our calculations that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "such a formulation of the radiative disk / corona coupling was introduced by @xcite .    the local flux @xmath19 is generated by a heating mainly of the ions , because a gravitational energy by accreting gas is transported directly to this particles @xcite . in this case the flux @xmath19 is proportioned to @xmath1-viscosity introduced by @xcite and the total pressure @xmath51 .",

    "we interpolate the factor @xmath67 from the tables prepared in advance from monte carlo computations",
    ".    the vertical division of the medium into hot corona and relatively cold disk at every radius should not be arbitrary .",
    "indeed , such a division results naturally from the criterion of thermal instability in a irradiated medium studied by @xcite which naturally develops in the surface layers of an irradiated accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the ionization stage of the medium is conveniently expressed through a ionization parameter @xmath68 .",
    "it is defined as a ratio of the ionization radiation pressure to the gas pressure @xmath69 the phase transition from cold to hot medium occurs with a transcend of a specific value of the ionization parameter @xmath68 @xcite .",

    "the set of equations ( [ omega ] )  ( [ eq : xi2 ] ) allows to calculate the properties of the corona at each radius , as a function of global model parameters , i.e. mass of the central black hole , @xmath18 , the accretion rate , @xmath17 , and the value of viscosity parameter , @xmath1 , in the corona including the electron temperature and the optical depth .",
    "the local spectrum is now computed as a disk spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eq : fnusoft ] ) comptonized by the local corona .",
    "comptonization process was calculated using code based on the semi - analytical formulae of @xcite for a slab geometry .",
    "this description allows for fast computations on a fine radial grid .",
    "the final spectrum is calculated through the integration of the local spectra over all disk radii .",
    "since the effect of corona is strongly dependent on the radius - it is weak close to the black hole and reaches maximum at a distance about a few hundred @xmath73 , depending on the accretion rate , this integration is essential .",
    "it also means that hard x - ray emission comes mostly from the outer parts while weakest comptonization in the innermost part creates a soft x - ray tail to the local disk spectrum .",
    "our corona model is universal in a sense that it does not contain any differentiation between radio loud and radio quiet objects while the composite spectra for the two classes of objects is clearly different .",
    "to model such systematic difference we eventually allow for the existence of an additional extended medium ( see  fig .",

    "we applied the numerical program , which was written by @xcite and which is based on procedures by @xcite .",
    "such an accurate method would be too time consuming to apply to the comptonization by the corona at each radius and it was not really necessary since the final integration over the disk surface ( an a range of temperatures and optical depths ) smeared any specific comptonization features even if present in the spectra ( mostly first scattering effect ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the hard x - ray radiation in radio - loud objects comes from the jet .",
    "the extension of the hard x - ray power law into high energies is not well constrained in quasars so the nature of this emission is not known .",
    "the studies of galactic sources in their soft states , however , suggest that in such a spectral state of an accreting black hole the hard x - ray emission comes from the non - thermal tail of electron distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for ) .    therefore , we do not expect that our thermal corona model will explain the hard x - ray radiation .",
    "we treat this hard x - ray power law emission as an additional component and we add it to the resulting spectrum adopting the slope and normalization appropriate for radio loud and radio quiet objects separately .",
    "we first discuss the basic version of the model , i.e. disk plus corona , which is described by the mass of the black hole , @xmath18 , accretion rate , @xmath17 , coronal viscosity parameter , @xmath1 , and two parameters determining the color temperature distribution in the disk : @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "the uv part of the composite spectrum is mostly determined by the first two parameters which govern the total luminosity and the position of the peak on @xmath77 diagram .",

    "( 1997 ) and recently reeves & turner ( 2000 ) were able to determine the iron @xmath121 line properties on the basis of asca data .",
    "the line energy is at @xmath122 kev for objects of the brightness comparable to those in the composite spectrum , which corresponds to the value of the ionization parameter @xmath123 about a few hundred ( e.g. . zycki & czerny , 1994 ) .",
    "the medium at the temperature @xmath124 k and optical depth @xmath125 is expected to develop under moderate external irradiation by the ( non - thermal ? ) hard x - ray component since the temperature corresponds to an inverse compton temperature for effectively soft total radiation field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , such a skin will result in very weak comptonization effect , and in particular , it will not change the color temperature of the big blue bump peak . to explain the color to effective temperature ratio of about 2 we need a thick layer ( @xmath126 ) remaining at the color temperature due to some heating and due to cooling by saturate comptonization .",
    "the absorption in this zone should be negligible - otherwise the temperature would drop down to the effective temperature .",
    "the results of @xcite as well as @xcite predict such a strong comptonization because the computations do not contain bound - bound and bound - free transitions which are efficient coolants at the discussed temperatures , particularly oxygen , carbon and iron lines are important .",
    "computations of irradiated media including those transitions do not show the color to effective temperature ratio in the thermalised emission significantly different from 1 ( e.g. madej & r ' o. za ' nska , 2000 ; nayakshin et al . , 2000 ;",
    "dumont et al . ,",
    "the required level of ionization for efficient comptonization seems to be higher than naturally predicted in an irradiated medium .",
    "similar problem was found by @xcite when they tried to explain the universal position of the soft x - ray excess as the reflection feature from the weakly ionized medium .",
    "the presence of the heavy corona further suppresses the ionization level at the disk surface if the corona is in the hydrostatic equilibrium with the disk @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the effect is caused by significant generation of the energy close to the disk surface .",
    "such an enhanced generation was not included in the performed radiative transfer computations .",
    "it would mean that the vertical distribution of heat generation is not well parameterized by the @xmath127 prescription and the magnetic field may be responsible for such a global redistribution .",
    "on the other hand , the conclusion on the large color to effective temperature ratio relies strongly on the shape of the composite spectrum in uv  far uv band which still has to be tested ( see sect .  [ sect : other ] ) .",
    "the adopted corona model adequately described the soft x - ray part of the composite spectrum for radio loud objects .",
    "low optical depth of the corona and a broad electron temperature range predicted by the model at different radii was adequate to give the observed effect of moderate comptonization .",
    "however , in this model the comptonization is definitely too weak to account for the soft x - ray spectrum of radio quiet objects .",
    "similar modeling of the composite spectrum of radio quiet objects was performed by @xcite and in their case the modeling was successful .",
    "this was caused by the fact that in their approach the fraction of the energy dissipated in the corona and the optical depth of the corona at a given radius were free parameters of their model . in our corona model",
    "the radial distribution of those quantities were calculated from the global parameters ( black hole mass , accretion rate and viscosity parameter ) since the spontaneous division of the flow into the disk and corona part results from the cooling properties of the material in the optically thin and optically thick part . as a result ,",
    "our corona was never as thick as assumed by kawaguchi et al .",
    ", independently from the assumed viscosity parameter .",
    "our corona model , adopted after janiuk & czerny ( 2000 ) , contained several simplifications .",
    "however , recent progress in corona modeling does not seem to improve the situation .",
    "if the corona is assumed to be accreting , and the advection is included , the corona above a disk is even weaker than in our description @xcite .",
    "better description of the disk / corona transition and replacement of eqs .",
    "[ eq : xi1][eq : xi2 ] with the disk evaporation condition due to the electron conduction ( r ' o. za ' nska & czerny , 2000a ) leads again to the prediction of still weaker corona for high accretion rates ( r ' o. za ' nska & czerny , 2000b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of the magnetic field may weaken the efficiency of the conduction and reduce the condensation effect found in the innermost part of the disk accreting at a high rate .",
    "although a theory did not say its last word on this subject as the formation of the corona is a badly understood process it may suggest that actually the disk corona is too weak to produce the soft x - ray spectrum of radio quiet quasars and the existence of the additional comptonizing medium may be necessary .    the comparison of the radio loud objects and radio quiet objects may suggest that the outflow takes place in all types of agn ( for a review , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". in radio loud objects the outflow is collimated in a form of jet , so the jet contributes to the hard x - ray emission but generally it does not cover our line of sight to the most part of the accretion flow .",
    "the mechanism of this collimation and its distance from the black hole is still under debate ( e.g. sikora , 2001 ) . in radio",
    "quiet objects the outflow perhaps is not collimated so the outflowing plasma is in our line of sight and comptonizes the disk / corona emission .",
    "we show such a putative geometry in fig .",
    "[ outflow ] .",
    "some kind of outflow is frequently predicted by the corona models or two - dimensional computations of the accretion flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the estimate of the amount of outflowing mass and its physical conditions is difficult and no predictions differentiating between the radio loud and radio quiet objects are available within the frame of this approach .",
    "the properties of the outflowing material may significantly depend on the considered distance from the black hole as well as the inclination angle which further complicates the issue ( e.g. elvis , 2000 ) .",
    "the dominant role of the comptonization in formation of the soft x - ray spectra implies that no strong emission lines are expected in this band .",
    "on the other hand , models of coronal flares predict that a significant fraction of the disk is not covered by the corona but it is strongly irradiated .",
    "such irradiated internally not heated layers are the source of rich emission line spectrum in soft x - ray band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the hot layer is optically thin due to thermal instability in the heated / cooled plasma ( krolik et al . , 1981 ; r ' o. za ' nska & czerny , 1996 ) .",
    "high resolution observations were performed so far in the case of a few seyfert 1 galaxies , and the results were not definite : branduardi - raymond et al . , ( 2000 ) claimed that broad oxygen , nitrogen and carbon emission lines , of similar shape to @xmath121 iron line , are present in the xmm - newton spectra of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 while lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that they see only the warm absorber effect on the continuum in the chandra spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "more detailed analysis of new xmm and chandra data should resolve this issue .",
    "* disk / corona model of janiuk & czerny ( 2000 ) based on thermal instability well describes the composite spectrum of radio loud faint quasars in the optical - soft x - ray band if the color to effective temperature ratio is close to 2 in the innermost part of the disk * adopted disk / corona model does not account for the soft x - ray spectrum in radio quiet faint quasars and additional comptonizing medium is required , possibly due to the uncollimated outflowing hot plasma",
