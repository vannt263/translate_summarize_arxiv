    "since ohtomo and hwang reported the existence of a high mobility electron gas at the @xmath0-type ( lao)@xmath2/(tio@xmath3)@xmath4 interface between two band - gap insulators lao and sto@xcite , many novel properties related to the electron gas at the interface , such as insulator - metal transition , superconductivity , and ferromagnetism were found@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of conductivity and the dimensionality of the induced carrier at the interface were intensively studied . in the @xmath0-type interface structure a polar electrical field along lao [ 001 ] direction is arisen from the alternating stack of ( lao)@xmath2 and ( alo@xmath3)@xmath5 charged layers .",
    "charge reconstruction at the interface was proposed as a way to avoid diverging electrostatic potential with thick lao , which compensates the polar electric field in lao and induces electron gas at the interface@xcite . the densities and distributions of the induced carriers charge",
    "were measured in various experiments @xcite .",
    "two different origins of the induced carriers charge , i.e. intrinsic and extrinsic doping , have been proposed .",
    "intrinsic charge doping at the interface mainly happens in stoichiometrical structure without oxygen vacancy@xcite . with thick lao overlayer the charge transfers from valence band of lao surface to conduction band of sto at the interface , leading to a metallic interface@xcite .",
    "while extrinsic charge doping was found to be ascribed to oxygen vacancies in many experiments@xcite .",
    "noticeably , the conducting properties at intrinsic and extrinsic doped interfaces measured in the experiments are very different . in the ideal interface of thin lao overlayer without oxygen vacancy",
    "the carrier densities measured by hall effect and x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) are even less than 0.1 electron per two - dimensional unit cell ( 2-d.u.c.)@xcite .",
    "recent density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations showed that ionic polar distortions partially compensate polar electric field in lao , reducing carrier density at the interface@xcite .",
    "for thin lao overlayer the carrier charge was found in xps experiment to distribute in a few layers of sto at the interface@xcite .",
    "latest dft study found that for less than 7 layers of lao the carrier charge distributes in 3 layers of sto but for thicker lao the carrier could accumulate in deep sto layers about 3 nm away from the interface .",
    "however , with oxygen vacancies in the interface structure the carrier densities measured in experiments vary from 0.5 to three orders of magnitude e/2-d.u.c .",
    "dependent on the oxygen pressure in preparing process@xcite .",
    "the experiment in ref .",
    "[ ] explicitly verified that high carrier density is ascribed to high concentration of oxygen vacancies in sto substrate which were generated under lower oxygen pressure during preparing the sample .",
    "besides the carrier density , another issue which people have been debating extensively is the distribution of carrier charge induced by oxygen vacancy . in some sample produced in high oxygen pressure two - dimensional distributions were observed@xcite , but in others produced in low oxygen pressure obvious 3-dimensional distribution in sto were observed @xcite .",
    "these experimental hints indicated the carrier distribution is related to the concentration of oxygen vacancies in some way .",
    "up to now , people have realized that oxygen vacancy play an important role in n - type lao / sto interface , however the locations of oxygen vacancies and the dependence of two - dimensional and three - dimensional carrier distributions on the locations of oxygen vacancies are still not clear .    in this paper",
    "we studied the n - type interface with oxygen vacancies by using density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "it should be noted that the interface composed of sandwich structure was also investigated in experiment but the structure of lao overlayer on sto substrate has attracted the most of attentions because of its abundant conducting properties . in this paper we focused on the structure of lao overlayer on sto .",
    "we calculated and compared the total energies of the configurations with varying locations and concentrations of oxygen vacancies .",
    "we found that the locations of oxygen vacancies are related to the concentration . from the calculations of electronic structures we also unveiled that the distribution of carriers is strongly dependent on the locations of oxygen vacancies .",

    "we modeled the lao / sto interface by a slab consisting of 2 to 7 lao layers on top of sto(001 ) substrate and a vacuum region of 14  along the @xmath6-axis in a supercell geometry .",
    "dipole corrections were used to correct the errors of electrostatic potential , forces , and total energy caused by periodic boundary condition @xcite . to simulate various concentrations of oxygen vacancies",

    "oxygen vacancies were explicitly confirmed to exist in sto substrate of the interface structure produced under low oxygen pressure@xcite .",
    "however , up to now there has been no report about whether oxygen vacancy exits in lao . to investigate the location of oxygen vacancy we calculated the total energies of oxygen vacancy in varying locations under various concentrations .",

    "figure  [ bindinge1 ] presents the binding energies of one oxygen atom corresponding to the vacancy at varying locations in ( 3@xmath72 ) and ( 2@xmath72 ) supercell .",
    "oxygen atom in lao surface has the lowest binding energy , which is far less than that in sto substrate .",
    "this indicates that oxygen vacancy is most easily formed in lao surface rather than in sto substrate .",
    "moreover the binding energy of oxygen atom in lao surface decreases with the thickness of lao .",
    "such results are strongly related to polar electric field in lao . in the ideal interface structure the polar field shifts the energy bands of lao toward higher energy layer by layer , substantially raising the total energy . while oxygen vacancy in lao dopes electron carriers at the interface , which partially or completely screen the polar field in lao , remarkably lowering the total energy .",
    "in contrast to the vacancy in the surface , the vacancy inside lao just screens part of polar field from the layer with the vacancy to the interface . therefore corresponding configuration has higher total energy , as illustrated in fig .",

    "formation energy of ideal structure without vacancy is taken as zero.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to investigate dependence of the formation of oxygen vacancy in the surface on the thickness of lao , we calculated the formation energies of one vacancy in the surface of ( 2@xmath72 ) supercells consisting of 2 to 5 layers of lao according to the formula @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is chemical potential of oxygen atom , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 are total energies of the system with one oxygen vacancy in the surface and ideal system without vacancy , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ formatione ] the formation energies of ( 2@xmath72 ) supercells with one vacancy in lao surface decrease with the thickness of lao overlayer and trend to converge for those of thickness of lao more than 4 layers . as aforementioned , in the ideal structure the electrostatic energy induced by polar field increases with the thickness of lao .",
    "following electronic calculations show that for ( 2@xmath72 ) supercells with one oxygen vacancy in the surface the density of doping charge at the interface is 0.5 e/2-d.u.c . , which exactly compensates polar electric field .",
    "this implies that oxygen vacancy in the surface of thicker lao overlayer eliminates more electrostatic energy than that of thinner lao overlayer . while once the lao overlayer exceeds 4 layers , as demonstrated in previous dft studies , in ideal structure without vacancy the intrinsic doping charge at the interface partially screens the polar field , preventing the increasing of electrostatic energy with the thickness of lao@xcite .",
    "therefor , the energy difference between vacant and ideal structures does not increase with thickness of lao .",
    "so we can predict that under same preparing condition oxygen vacancy can be formed more easily in the sample with thicker lao film , while this tendency does not strengthen any more once lao exceeds 4 layers .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ formatione ] , for two unitcells ( 2@xmath72 ) and ( 3@xmath72 ) which have the same 4 layers of lao the lower concentration of vacancy is more stable and therefor more easily be formed .",
