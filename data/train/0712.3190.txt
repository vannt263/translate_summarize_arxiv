    "research in the last decade showed that to understand the assembly and formation of massive galaxies it is critical to study submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . since their first detection ten years ago @xcite , more than three hundred dust - enshrouded high - z objects ( z @xmath72 )",

    "thus , typically interferometric observations at radio wavelength with the vla were used to identify the location of the smgs , yielding a radio identification rate of @xmath8% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the main drawback of this technique is , however , that the radio flux is redshift dependent , whereas the ( sub)mm flux density at z  @xmath9 is not ( due to the inverse k correction ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we note that the radio - identified smg with the highest redshift lies at z  @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "based on this sample , co observations of radio identified smgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lead to the main conclusion that smgs are massive galaxies in formation and @xcite argue that the contribution to the star - formation rate density ( sfrd ) from this population is missed by uv - selected surveys .",
    "if one only uses radio - identified sources ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one thus has to be aware of the fact that the radio selection introduces a bias towards the low end of the true redshift distribution . to summarize , our knowledge about the nature and properties of the smg population is mainly based on radio - identified smgs  a biased sample .",
