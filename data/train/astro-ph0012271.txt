    "observational studies of the distant universe are undergoing a revolution brought about by breakthroughs achieved with the _ hst _ , _ keck _ , and _ jcmt _ telescopes , and the _ iso _ satellite .",
    "the remarkable progress in our understanding of faint galaxy data made possible by the combination of _ hst _ deep imaging and ground  based spectroscopy has permitted in the last few years to shed new light on the evolution of the stellar birthrate in the universe , to identify the epoch where most of the optical extragalactic background light was produced , and to set important contraints on galaxy evolution scenarios .",
    "the use of novel instruments and observational techniques has led to the measurement of the abundance and clustering of actively star  forming objects at redshift @xmath9 and to the discovery of galaxies and qsos at redshift in excess of 5 , when the universe was less than 6% of its current age .",
    "the explosion in the quantity of information available on the high  redshift universe at optical wavelengths has been complemented by the detection by dirbe and firas onboard the _ cobe _ satellite of the far  ir / sub  mm background  which has revealed that a significant fraction of the energy released by stellar nucleosynthesis is re  emitted as thermal radiation by dust ",
    "and by theoretical progress made in understanding how baryons follows the dynamics dictated by dark matter halos until radiative , hydrodynamic , and star formation processes take over .",
    "while ongoing studies with _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ may be discovering a new population of highly absorbed , dusty agns ( type 2 qsos ) , of importance for galaxy formation models also appear the recent findings of a strong link between the masses of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies and the properties of the host stellar bulges , and the suggestion from magellanic cloud microlensing experiments and systematic proper",
    " motion surveys that a non  negligible fraction of the dark matter in the galactic halo may be tied up in very old , cool white dwarfs .",
    "the underlying goal of all these efforts is to understand the growth of structures , the internal properties of galaxies and their evolution , and ultimately to map the star formation and supermassive black hole accretion histories of the universe from the end of the ` dark age ' to the present epoch .",
    "the implications of the observed energy density of the ebl for the cosmic stellar and metal budget , and the quasar contribution to the brightness of the night sky , will be the subject of this talk .",
    "unless otherwise stated , an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 will be adopted in the following .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the galaxy number  magnitude relation is a remarkably simple cosmological probe of the history of stellar birth in galaxies , as it must drop below 0.4 to yield a finite value for the ebl .",
    "this appears to be the case in all seven @xmath13 optical bandpasses , i.e. the light from resolved galaxies has converged from the uv to the near  ir ( madau & pozzetti 2000 , hereafter mp ) .",
    "the flattening at faint apparent magnitudes can not be due to the reddening of distant sources as their lyman break gets redshifted into the blue passband , since the fraction of lyman  break galaxies at ( say ) @xmath14 is small .",
    "moreover , an absorption  induced loss of sources can not explain the similar change of slope of the galaxy counts observed in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "while this suggests that the surface density of optically luminous galaxies is leveling off beyond @xmath17 , one should note that different algorithms used for ` growing ' the photometry beyond the outer isophotes of galaxies may significantly change the magnitude of faint objects . according to bernstein ( 2000 ) , roughly 50% of the flux from resolved galaxies with @xmath18 mag lie outside the standard  sized apertures used by photometric packages . an extragalactic sky pedestal created by the overlapping wings of resolved galaxies",
    "may contribute to the sky level , and would be undetectable except by absolute surface photometry .",
    "also , at faint magnitude levels , distant objects which are brighter than the nominal depth of the catalog may be missed due to the @xmath19 dimming factor .",
    "all these systematic errors are inherent in faint  galaxy photometry ; as a result , estimates of the integrated fluxes from resolved galaxies should be strictly considered as lower limits ( see pozzetti & madau , this volume ) .",
    "the spectrum of the optical ebl is shown in figure 1 , together with the recent results from _",
    "cobe_. the value derived by integrating the galaxy counts down to very faint magnitude levels ( because of the flattening of the number  magnitude relation most of the contribution to the optical ebl comes from relatively bright galaxies ) implies a lower limit to the ebl intensity in the 0.22.2 @xmath20 m interval of @xmath21 . including the tentative detections at 2.2 and 3.5 @xmath20 m by gorjan ( 2000 )",
    "( see also dwek & arendt 1998 ) would boost @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "recent direct measurements of the ebl at 3000 , 5500 , and 8000    from absolute surface photometry lie between a factor of 2.5 to 3 higher than the integrated light from galaxy counts , with an uncertainty that is largely due to systematic rather than statistical error ( bernstein 2000 ) . applying this correction factor to the range 30008000",
    "  gives a total optical ebl intensity in the range @xmath24 .",
    "this could become @xmath25 if the same correction holds also in the near  ir ( gorjan 2000 ) .",
    "the _ cobe_/firas ( fixsen 1998 ) measurements yield @xmath26 in the 1252000 @xmath20 m range .",
    "when combined with the dirbe ( hauser 1998 ) points at 140 and 240 @xmath20 m , one gets a far  ir background intensity of @xmath27 . the detection with dirbe of a fir signal in excess of the expected zodiacal and galactic emission by finkbeiner ( 2000 ) , if confirmed , would imply an integrated ebl in the window 452000 @xmath20 m of @xmath28 .",
    "the residual emission in the 3.5 to 140 @xmath20 m region is poorly known , but it is likely to exceed @xmath29 ( dwek 1998 ) .",
    "a ` best  guess ' estimate of the total ebl intensity observed today appears to be @xmath30 in the following , we will adopt a reference value for the background light associated with star formation activity over the entire history of the universe of @xmath31 .",
    "with the help of some simple stellar population synthesis tools we can now set a lower limit to the total stellar mass density that produced the observed ebl , and constrain the cosmic history of star birth in galaxies .",
    "one of the most serious uncertainties in this calculation is the lower cutoff , usually treated as a free parameter , of the initial mass function ( imf ) . observations of m subdwarfs stars with the _ hst _ have recently shed some light on this issue , showing that the imf in the galactic disk can be represented analytically over the mass range @xmath32 ( here @xmath33 is in solar units ) by @xmath34 ( gould 1996 , hereafter gbf ) . for @xmath35",
    "this mass distribution agrees well with a salpeter function .",
    "a shallow mass function below @xmath36 has also been recently measured in the galactic bulge ( zoccali 2000 ) and in globular clusters ( paresce & de marchi 2000 ) . observations of normal galactic star ",
    "forming regions also show some convergence in the basic form of the imf at intermediate and high masses , a power  law slope that is consistent with the salpeter value ( elmegreen 1998 ; massey 1998 ) . in the following",
    "we will use a ` universal ' imf ( shown in figure 2 ) with the gbf form for @xmath37 , matched to a salpeter slope for @xmath38 ; the mass integral of this function is 1.7 times smaller than that obtained by extrapolating a salpeter function down to @xmath39 .",
    "is very small for a ` typical ' imf , the use of a gbf mass function at low masses instead of salpeter leaves the total radiated luminosity of a stellar population virtually unaffected . ]",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the _ bolometric _ luminosity as a function of age @xmath40 of a simple stellar population ( a single generation of coeval , chemically homogeneous stars having total mass @xmath41 , solar metallicity , and the above imf ) can be well approximated by @xmath42 over a timescale of 13 gyr ",
    "the age of the universe for an eds cosmology with @xmath43  about 1.3 mev per stellar baryon will be radiated away .",
    "this number depends only weakly on the assumed metallicity of stars . in a stellar system with arbitrary star formation rate per comoving cosmological volume , @xmath44 , the bolometric emissivity at time @xmath45",
    "is given by the convolution integral @xmath46 the total background light observed at earth ( @xmath47 ) , generated by a stellar population with a formation epoch @xmath48 , is @xmath49 where the factor @xmath50 at the denominator is lost to cosmic expansion when converting from observed to radiated ( comoving ) luminosity density .    to set a lower limit to the present  day mass density , @xmath51 , of recycled gas @xmath2 stars ( in units of the critical density @xmath52 ) , consider now a scenario where all stars are formed _ instantaneously _ at redshift @xmath53 .",
    "the background light that would be observed at earth from such an event is shown in figure 3 as a function of @xmath53 for @xmath54 , corresponding respectively to 4 , 7 , and 9 percent of the nucleosynthetic baryon density , @xmath55 ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "two main results are worth stressing here : ( 1 ) the time evolution of the luminosity radiated by a simple stellar population ( eq .",
    "2 ) makes the dependence of the observed ebl from @xmath53 much shallower than the @xmath56 lost to cosmic expansion ( see eq .",
    "4 ) , as the energy output from stars is spread over their respective lifetimes ; and ( 2 ) in order to generate an ebl at a level of @xmath57 , one requires @xmath1 for an eds universe with @xmath43 , hence a mean mass  to  blue light ratio today of @xmath58 ( the total blue luminosity density at the present  epoch is @xmath59 , ellis 1996 ) . the dependence of these estimates on the cosmological model ( through eq .",
    "4 ) is rather weak .    a visible mass density at the level of the above lower limit , while able to explain the measured sky brightness , requires all the stars that give origin to the observed ebl to have formed at very low redshifts ( @xmath60 , a scenario which appears to be at variance with the observed evolution of the uv luminosity density ( lilly 1996 ; madau 1998 ) . for illustrative purposes , it is interesting to consider instead a model where the star formation rate per unit comoving volume stays _ constant _ with cosmic time . in an eds cosmology with @xmath43 ,",
    "one derives from equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) @xmath61 the observed ebl therefore implies a ` fiducial ' mean star formation rate ( sfr ) density of @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 , a factor 3 _ higher _ than the value measured at @xmath65 by treyer ( 1998 ) . , appropriate for the assumed imf , and corrected upwards the observed @xmath66 by a factor of 1.8 for dust extinction . ]",
    "any value much smaller than this over a sizeable fraction of the hubble time will generate an ebl well short of @xmath67 .",
    "ignoring for the moment the recycling of returned gas into new stars , the _ visible _ mass density at the present epoch is simply @xmath68 , corresponding to @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( both values would be a factor of 1.7 higher in the case of a salpeter imf down to 0.1 @xmath71 ) .    a more realistic scenario which fits the most recent measurements of the rest ",
    "frame uv  continuum and h@xmath72 luminosity densities from the present  epoch to @xmath73 ( after a correction for dust extinction is applied to the data ) and produces a total ebl of about the right magnitude ( @xmath74 ) , is one where the sfr density _ evolves _ as ( eds , @xmath43 ) @xmath75 this sfr density ( an updated version of the one used in eq .",
    "8 of mp ) increases slowly  by about a factor of 4  from the present - epoch to @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "cowie 1999 ) and remains constant at @xmath77 ( steidel 1999 ) .",
    "since about half of the present  day stars are formed at @xmath78 in this model and their contribution to the ebl is redshifted away , the resulting visible mass density is @xmath79 and @xmath80 , slightly larger than in the @xmath81const approximation .    we conclude that , depending on the star formation history and for the assumed imf , the observed ebl requires between 8% and 12% of the nucleosynthetic baryon density to be today in the forms of stars , recycled gas , and their remnants . according to the most recent census of cosmic baryons , the mass density in stars and their remnants observed today is @xmath82 ( fukugita 1998 ) , corresponding to a mean stellar mass  to  blue light ratio of @xmath83 ( roughly 70% of this mass is found in old spheroidal populations ) .",
    "while this is lower than the @xmath84 ratio predicted by equation ( 6 ) , one should note that efficient recycling of ejected gas into new star formation would tend to reduce the apparent difference in the budgets .",
    "with the adopted imf , about 30% of this mass will be returned to the interstellar medium in @xmath85 yr , after intermediate  mass stars eject their envelopes and massive stars explode as supernovae .",
    "this return fraction , @xmath86 , becomes 50% after about 10 gyr.^{-1}\\approx 0.5 $ ] , can be obtained by using the semiempirical initial ( @xmath33)final ( @xmath87 ) mass relation of weidemann ( 1987 ) for stars with @xmath88 , and by assuming that stars with @xmath89 return all but a @xmath90 remnant . ]   alternatively , the gas returned by stars may be ejected into the intergalactic medium . with an imf - averaged yield of returned metals of @xmath91,^{-1}$ ] , the stellar yields @xmath92 of tsujimoto ( 1995 ) , and a gbf@xmath2salpeter imf . in the case of a salpeter imf down to @xmath93 , @xmath94 should be multiplied by 0.6 . ]",
    "the predicted mean metallicity at the present epoch is @xmath5 , similar to the values inferred from cluster abundances ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "table 1 +   +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note.these values assume an eds cosmology with @xmath43 , a gbf@xmath2salpeter imf , and an ebl intensity of @xmath67 .",
    "the cosmic stellar baryon and metal budget is summarized in table 1 for the three different modes ( instantaneous , constant , and evolving ) of sf considered .",
    "note that a steeper imf ",
    "e.g. a scalo function which is significantly less rich in massive stars than salpeter  or an imf which does not flatten below @xmath0 would generate mass  to  light ratios that are too high compared to the observed values .",
    "the nature of the dark matter in the halo of galaxies remains one of the outstanding problems in astrophysics .",
    "one of the most interesting constraints posed by the observed brightness of the night sky concerns the possibility that a significant fraction of the dark mass in present  day galaxy halos may be associated with faint white  dwarf ( wd ) remnants of a population of intermediate  mass stars that formed at high redshifts .",
    "the latest results of the microlensing macho experiment towards the lmc , interpreted in the context of a galactic dark matter halo consisting partially of compact objects , give a macho halo fraction of 20% , with a 95% confidence interval of 850% ( alcock 2000 ) .",
    "similar results have been reached by the eros collaboration ( lasserre 2000 ) .",
    "the most likely macho mass is between 0.15 and 0.9 @xmath95 : this mass scale is a natural one for wds , a scenario also supported by the lack of a numerous spheroidal population of low ",
    "mass main sequence stars in the hdf ( gould 1998 ) , and by the recent discovery of two ancient halo wds in a systematic proper motion survey ( ibata 2000 ) .",
    "the total mass of machos inferred within 50 kpc is @xmath96 ( alcock 2000 ) , implying a ` macho  to  blue light ' ratio for the milky way in the range 4 to 10 solar ( cf fields 1998 ) .",
    "if these values were typical of the luminous universe as a whole , i.e. if machos could be viewed as a new stellar population having similar properties in all disk galaxies , then the cosmological mass density of machos today would be @xmath97 , a significant entry in the cosmic baryon budget , @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 is the fraction of the blue luminosity density radiated by stellar disks ( fukugita 1998 ) .",
    "note that if machos are halo wds , the contribution of their _ progenitors _ to the mass density parameter is several times higher .",
    "halo imfs which are very different from that of the solar neighborhood , i.e. which are heavily  biased towards wd progenitors and have very few stars forming with masses below @xmath100 ( as these would produce bright wds in the halo today that are not seen ) and above @xmath101 ( to avoid the overproduction of heavy elements ) , have been suggested as a suitable mechanism for explaining the microlensing data ( chabrier 1996 ) . while the halo wd scenario may be tightly constrained by the observed rate of type ia sne in galaxies ( smecker & wyse 1991 ) , by the expected c and n overenrichment of halo stars ( gibson & mould 1997 ) , and by the number counts of faint galaxies in deep optical surveys ( charlot & silk 1995 ) , here we explore a potentially more direct method (",
    "as it is does not depend on , e.g. extrapolating stellar yields to primordial metallicities , on galactic winds removing the excess heavy elements into the intergalactic medium , or on the reddening of distant halos by dust ) , namely we will compute the contribution of wd progenitors in dark galaxy halos to the extragalactic background light .",
    "following chabrier ( 1999 ) ( see also mp ) , we adopt a truncated power  law imf , @xmath102 this form mimics a mass function strongly peaked at @xmath103 . to examine the dependence of the imf on the results we consider two functions ( shown in figure 2 ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 : both yield a present  day galactic halo mass  to  light ratio @xmath106 after a hubble time , as required in the absence of a large non  baryonic component .",
    "we further assume that a population of halo wd progenitors having mass density @xmath107 formed instantaneously at redshift @xmath53 with this imf and nearly primordial ( @xmath108 ) metallicity .",
    "the resulting ebl from such an event is shown in figure 4 for @xmath109 and 0.6 and a @xmath110dominated universe with @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 gyr ) .",
    "consider the @xmath104 case first . with @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    ", this scenario would generate an ebl at a level of @xmath117 . even if only 30% of the nucleosynthetic baryons formed at @xmath118 with a wd ",
    "progenitor dominated imf , the resulting background light at earth would exceed the value of @xmath119 , the ` best  guess ' upper limit to the observed ebl from the data plotted in figure 1 .",
    "since the return fraction of this imf is @xmath120 , only 20% of this stellar mass would be leftover as wds , the rest being returned to the ism .",
    "therefore , if galaxy halos comprise 100% of the nucleosynthetic baryons , only a small fraction of their mass , @xmath121 could be in the form of wds .",
    ", helps only marginally . with @xmath104 , the energy radiated per stellar baryon over a timescale of 13",
    "gyr is equal to 2 mev , corresponding to 10 mev per baryon in wd remnants .",
    "a similar value is obtained in the @xmath105 case : because of the shorter lifetimes of more massive stars the expected ebl is reduced , but only by 20% or so ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "moreover , the decreasing fraction of leftover wds would raise more severe problems of metal galactic enrichment . ]    in qualitative agreement with the most recent microlensing results ( alcock 2000 ; lasserre 2000 ) , these limits likely imply a non  baryonic dark halo . on the other hand , we draw attention to the fact that , even if only 20% of the baryons in the universe turned into halo wd progenitors at @xmath122 , their background light should be detectable as a peak in the ebl around @xmath123 m . in figure 1",
    "we show the ebl produced by such a wd ",
    "progenitor dominated imf with @xmath105 and @xmath124 , assuming negligible dust reddening . intriguingly",
    ", this model appears to be consistent with measurements of the optical / near  ir ebl by bernstein ( 2000 ) and gorjan ( 2000 ) .",
    "an accurate determination of the contribution of qsos to the ebl , @xmath125 , obtainable in principle by integrating the number  magnitude relation down to the detection threshold , is in practice made uncertain by our poor knowledge of the mean bolometric correction and of the sky brightness due to undetected faint objects .",
    "such a direct method also explicitly neglects the possible existence of a population of dusty agns with strong intrinsic absorption as invoked , e.g. , in many models for the x  ray background ( e.g. madau 1994 ; comastri 1995 ) : these type ii qsos , while undetected at optical wavelengths , could contribute significantly to the far  ir background and to the total ebl .",
    "moreover , the conversion of @xmath125 to the expected mass density of quasar remnants at the present ",
    "epoch , @xmath126 , ( assuming a standard black hole accretion model for qsos ) requires a correction for the radiation energy lost to the cosmic expansion which depends on the quasar redshift distribution .",
    "some ( but hardly all ) of these difficulties can perhaps be bypassed by computing instead , in analogy with the stellar case , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the comoving bolometric luminosity function of qsos at cosmic time @xmath45 .",

    "ray background ( xrb ) based on a mixture of unabsorbed type i and heavily absorbed type ii agns ( haardt & madau 2000 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the radiation background from qsos is shown in figure 5 ( we indicate it with @xmath129 instead of @xmath130 as it has been filtered through the absorption of the intergalactic medium at uv frequencies , cf . haardt & madau 1996 ) as a function of redshift",
    ". our model can simultaneously reproduce the observed spectrum of the xrb and the most recent source counts in both the soft and hard x  ray bands , and yields at the present  epoch a value of @xmath131 ( previous estimates range from 0.7 to 3 @xmath132 , soltan 1982 ; chokshi & turner 1992 ; small & blandford 1992 ) . in determining the mass density of quasar remnants at the present  epoch we take into account the large contribution due to the absorbed radiation of type ii agns ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 )",
    ". such radiation ( which is not shown in the spectrum of figure 5 ) is most probably re  emitted in the far ir band .",
    "we derive @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the efficiency of accreted mass  to  radiation conversion , equal to 5.7% for standard disk accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it is in principle possible to gauge our model for the evolution and emission properties of the quasar population by weighing the local mass density of black holes remnants .",
    "recent dynamical evidence indicates that supermassive black holes reside at the center of most nearby galaxies ( richstone 1998 ) .",
    "the available data ( more than 30 objects ) show an empirical correlation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass ( magorrian 1998 ) , which becomes even tighter when bulge velocity dispersion is plotted instead of luminosity ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt 2000 ) .",
    "the implied mean ratio of black hole to bulge mass is @xmath135 as a best  fit ( merritt & ferrarese 2000 ) , a factor of 5 smaller than the mean ratio computed by magorrian ( 1998 ) . the mass density in old spheroidal populations today",
