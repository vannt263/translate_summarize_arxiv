    "following the seminal _ cobe _ dmr discovery of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) after one year ( 1989/90 ) of observations ( smoot 1992 , bennett 1992 , wright 1992 , kogut 1992 ) the instrument continued operating until late 1993 .",
    "intermediate , 2-year results of the mission were reported by bennett ( 1994 ) ( also see e.g. grski 1994 , wright 1994 ) . an overview of the 4-year results is provided by bennett ( 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we apply the cmb anisotropy power spectrum estimation technique introduced by grski ( 1994 ) to the definitive , 4-year 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz sky maps resulting from the _ cobe _ dmr mission .",
    "the _ cobe _ dmr - detected anisotropy of the cmb provides a unique opportunity to measure the spatial distribution of the inhomogeneities in the universe on the comoving scales ranging from a few hundred mpc up to the present horizon size ( inaccessible to any other astronomical observations ) during the embryonic stage of their evolution , thereby avoiding the complications of ( cosmologically ) recent evolution of most astrophysical systems .",
    "there are , however , important experimental / observational limitations on the extent to which cosmologically interesting quantities can be extracted from the dmr data .",
    "these are imposed by our understanding of systematic effects , instrumental noise properties , and non - cosmological foreground signals peculiar to our location in the galaxy and in the universe , and were investigated as follows .",
    "kogut ( 1996c ) have addressed systematic effects in considerable detail and found them to be unimportant relative to the accuracy to which cosmological parameters can be determined from the dmr 4-year data .",
    "grski ( 1996 ) provide a comprehensive description of the noise properties of the dmr sky maps and demonstrate the sufficiency of the dmr noise models ( see also lineweaver 1994 ) .",
    "emission from the galactic plane can not yet be modelled to adequate precision and must be excised from the data ( see  2 and banday 1996a ) .",
    "foreground galactic emission at high latitude ( bennett 1992 , kogut 1996a , b ) can be partially accounted for by using galaxy - dominated spatial templates at frequencies where the cmb does not dominate ( see  3 , and kogut 1996a , b ) .",
    "the potential contamination of the cmb anisotropy by the astrophysical foregrounds outside of our galaxy is demonstrated to be negligible in banday ( 1996b ) .    in this work",
    "we focus on a general characterization of the 4-year dmr sky maps in terms of a power spectrum of the angular distribution of the cmb temperature fluctuations and attempt to estimate its sensitivity to a plausible foreground emission contamination .",
    "we follow and further develop the method introduced by grski ( 1994 , hereafter g94a ) and applied to the 2-year dmr data in grski ( 1994 , hereafter g94b ) . as a useful power spectrum parametrization",
    ", we utilize a power - law family specified by @xmath8 and @xmath9  the amplitude and shape parameters ( bond & efstathiou 1987 , fabbri , lucchin , & matarrese 1987 ) , but we abbreviate the symbol @xmath8 and use @xmath10 instead . the results of the analysis involving the cmb spectra of specific large scale structure models will be presented elsewhere .",
    "hereafter , bold letters denote matrices ( upper case ) and vectors ( lower case ) , and @xmath11 is a pixel label .",
    "our published analysis of the 2-year dmr data ( g94b ) involved a simple @xmath12 galaxy cut , which retained the relatively bright foreground emission from the scorpius - ophiucus and taurus - orion regions ( de vaucouleurs 1955 ) . in this work",
    "we employ new , extended galactic cuts ( see banday 1996a ) which further excise these regions from the data used for the inference of the cosmological cmb anisotropy .",
    "we consider both extended @xmath12 ( denoted ` @xmath13 ' ) and extended @xmath14 ( ` @xmath15 ' ) galaxy cuts .",
    "we analyze the dmr sky maps in both ecliptic ( ` e ' ) and galactic ( ` g ' ) pixelization . to facilitate a comparison of the 4-year results with the published analyses of the 2-year data we re -",
    "apply the simple @xmath12 galaxy cut . from a total of 6144 data pixels on the entire sky ,",
    "the following numbers of pixels remain for analysis after applying the different galactic cuts : 4038 for e20 , 4016 for g20 , 3890 for e20@xmath16 , 3881 for g20@xmath16 , 3039 for e30@xmath16 , and 3056 for g30@xmath16 .",
    "we form weighted average maps at each frequency by combining the a and b channels , @xmath17 minimizing the cut - sky - averaged noise variance per pixel in the combined maps .",
    "the weighted 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz 4-year cut - sky dmr maps are analyzed jointly ( equivalent to coaddition ) with and without the foreground correction , or linearly combined ( after foreground correction , indicated by tilde ) with the weights designed to remove any leftover free - free emission : @xmath18 the weights given to both 31.5 and 90 ghz maps in this linear combination technique are considerably larger than those in the coadded technique ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ) . as a result ,",
    "the noise is larger in the linear combination map @xmath21 , slightly exceeding the rms noise in the 90 ghz map alone .",
    "fourier analysis of the cut - sky maps is performed ( see g94a for details ) in the 961-dimensional linear space spanned by the orthonormal functions @xmath22 , which are linear combinations of spherical harmonics with @xmath23 .",
    "a sky map at frequency @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( where @xmath11 is the pixel label ) is fourier decomposed as follows @xmath26 fourier coefficients @xmath27 are linear in pixel temperatures , and account for the cut - sky mode coupling explicitly .",
    "figure 1 ( color plate ) displays an example of the @xmath22 basis function constructed for various versions of the galaxy cut used in this work .    the dominant component ( in rms per pixel ) of the raw , dipole - subtracted , cut - sky dmr maps is the instrument generated noise .",
    "a correct statistical modeling of this contaminant is essential for any method attempting to quantify the cosmological cmb anisotropy .",
    "a detailed analysis of noise properties of the entire dmr data set is discussed in grski ( 1996 ) . here",
    "we employ the noise modeling in fourier space as described in g94a , b .",
    "the noise content of the 4-year dmr data is characterized by the rms noise amplitudes per fourier mode of approximately 10.5 , 3.4 , and 5.5 @xmath28k at 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz , respectively .",
    "the coaddition of all available measurements at three frequencies renders a map with the rms noise amplitude per fourier mode of @xmath29k .",
    "following g94a , b , we conduct bayesian inference from the _ cobe _ dmr data of the power spectrum of primordial cmb anisotropy under the usual assumption that the measurement ( here the joint vector of coefficients of fourier decomposition of the 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz sky maps , @xmath30 ) is a sum of a signal  primordial cmb anisotropy , and noise  a random , receiver generated contamination , and that both these components are gaussian stochastic variables . hence , the likelihood function is _ exactly _ represented as a multivariate gaussian in variable @xmath31 .",
    "the likelihood density is fully specified by the fourier space correlation matrices of signal , @xmath32 , a function of the assumed ( and tested ) power spectrum of the cmb anisotropy , and noise ( at a given frequency @xmath24 ) , @xmath33 , which are are computed as described in g94a , b . no approximations or monte carlo simulations",
    "are required for evaluation of the likelihood function , and this power spectrum parameter estimation technique , bi - linear in the measurement values of temperature perturbations , is statistically unbiased .",
    "this formulation of the likelihood problem allows one naturally to address a problem of contamination of the cmb anisotropy data by the diffuse foreground emission .",
    "assume ( generally ) that the anisotropy , @xmath34 , is measured at @xmath35 frequencies @xmath24 , and the foreground emission can be measured or modeled as a certain number , @xmath36 , of non - stochastic spatial templates @xmath37 ( whose fourier transforms are @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the template corrected joint data vector , @xmath40 , and its covariance matrix , @xmath41 , are @xmath42 where the matrix @xmath43 specifies the gaussian probability distribution of the receiver noise contaminated theoretical cmb anisotropy signal at a given frequency @xmath44 . with these definitions",
    "the likelihood function takes the usual form @xmath45 this is a function of all parameters used to describe the cmb power spectrum and @xmath46 coefficients @xmath47 used in the foreground correction . for a given cmb power spectrum ( i.e. a fixed @xmath48 )",
    "the likelihood can be maximized with respect to parameters @xmath49 as a usual @xmath50 fitting problem ( naturally , the dimensionality of the data vector is presumed to be large compared to both @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . from the maximum likelihood equations , @xmath51 ,",
    "one derives the following set of linear equations ( for a given @xmath24 and @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 which render the maximum likelihood solutions @xmath54 .",
    "the parameter covariance matrix ( dimension @xmath55 ) is @xmath56 in both equations @xmath57 is a square portion of the inverse covariance matrix @xmath58 acting between frequencies @xmath24 , and @xmath59 .",
    "we apply this formalism to study the sensitivity of parametrization of the cosmological anisotropy derived from the dmr data to the possible contamination by high latitude galactic foreground emission .",
    "we assume that the faint foreground glow of synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission outside the galactic plane can be traced by the available templates from observations at frequencies where the cmb does not dominate",
    ". two plausible selections ( kogut 1996a , b ) are the _ dirbe _ 140 @xmath60 m data ( reach 1995 ) , and the 408 mhz full sky radio map ( haslam 1980 ) .",
    "( we also used the 110 , and 240 @xmath60 m _ dirbe _ data and found the coupling of these to the dmr frequencies indistiguishable from that derived at 140 @xmath60 m . )",
    "we conduct the analysis as outlined above with @xmath61 dmr frequencies and @xmath62 templates .",
    "together with the cmb parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 this constitutes an 8-dimensional likelihood problem .",
    "( a further extension of the method , described in banday 1996b , addresses the issue of cross - correlation of the dmr data with existing catalogues of extragalactic objects ; there we have employed @xmath63 templates , and solved the 20-dimensional likelihood problem . ) for each galaxy cut selection we evaluate the @xmath10-@xmath9 likelihood both without and with the foreground correction applied to the data . at each @xmath10-@xmath9 grid point",
    "we derive the maximum likelihood solutions @xmath64 ( and their covariance matrix ) , and use these values to evaluate the foreground corrected likelihood .",
    "maximization of the corrected likelihood renders simultaneously the most likely solution of both the cosmological ( @xmath10-@xmath9 ) , and foreground ( @xmath65 ) fitting problem .",
    "the likelihood surface in @xmath10 and @xmath9 is sharply peaked ( as shown in g94b for 2-year data ) , and despite it being non - gaussian in functional form , the average values of the foreground coupling constants ( @xmath66 , weighted by the corrected likelihood ) turn out practically identical to the maximum likelihood solutions .",
    "the likelihood averaged values of the six coupling constants between the three dmr maps and the 140 @xmath28 m and 408 mhz data are shown in fig .",
    "the physical interpretation of these results in terms of the inferred contribution of galactic dust , free - free , and synchrotron emission in the high - latitude dmr sky maps is discussed by kogut ( 1996a , b ) . here",
    ", we proceed to discuss the primary target of the analysis of the foreground corrected dmr sky maps  the cosmic cmb anisotropy .",
    "3 ( color plate ) shows the coadded , foreground corrected dmr sky maps in both the ecliptic and galactic coordinate pixelization . for visualization",
    "the maps have been `` cleaned '' by removing the @xmath67 noise ( the @xmath68 fwhm dmr beam picks up sky signals that are entirely contained within @xmath69 in fourier space ) .",
    "ecliptic and galactic maps appear very consistent at large angular scales , but near the pixel scale one can notice the localised effects of different noise binning depending on the reference frame .",
    "the choice of pixelization re - bins roughly half of the instrument noise while leaving the cmb anisotropy unchanged ; consequently , slight variations in the likelihood results are expected .",
    "4 displays the cut sky dmr power spectra before and after the foreground correction evaluated for four combinations of pixelization and galaxy cut .",
    "( these spectra are shown here for illustration purposes only ; the likelihood method uses the fourier coefficients @xmath27 , not any quadratic function thereof . ) the apparently steep power spectrum of the foreground galaxy templates , @xmath70 at higher @xmath71 , was discussed by kogut ( 1996a ) .",
    "an important result of the simultaneous cmb background @xmath72 and foreground @xmath73 fitting is that the galaxy correction affects only the very low order multipoles of the derived cosmic cmb anisotropy .",
    "since the quadrupole moment of the galaxy is partially counter - aligned to the cmb quadrupole ( kogut et al .",
    "1996b ) , correcting the dmr maps for galactic emission _",
    "increases _ the estimated cmb quadrupole .",
    "table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of the maximum likelihood solutions for the cmb anisotropy power spectrum model parameters .",
    "the first entries in table 1 refer to the high - latitude coadded dmr maps from which no model of galactic emission has been removed and include , for comparison with the published 2-year analyses , the results of re - application of the @xmath74deg galaxy cut .",
    "one should note the following : ( 1 ) compared to the g20 2-year results described in g94b , the 4-year dmr data render a slightly smaller , but statistically consistent , power sepctrum normalization ( roughly a @xmath75k drop of @xmath76 ) ; ( 2 ) solutions for @xmath9 are fairly stable with respect to variation of the galaxy cut , but the derived anisotropy amplitude decreases by more than 1 @xmath28k upon removal of the bright scorpius - ophiucus and taurus - orion foreground regions ( i.e. upon extension of galaxy cut from ` 20 ' to ` 20 + ' ) , ( 3 ) an extra , but smaller , decrese of the amplitude results from a further extension of galaxy cut ( to ` 30 + ' ) ; we consider this as suggestive of having reached a sufficiently deep galaxy plane excision with the ` 20 + ' cut .",
    "certainly the higher galactic cut excludes real cmb features correlated over large areas of the sky in the range @xmath77 , which affects the @xmath78 fits .",
    "comparing results for which the quadrupole is included ( @xmath79 ) to those from which it has been excluded ( @xmath80 ) , we find again a systematic shift to higher normalization and lower index @xmath9 in the quadrupole - excluded results .",
    "the shift is well within the uncertainties from noise and cosmic variance , but reflects at least in part the counter - alignment of the cmb and galactic quadrupoles : if the quadrupole is to be retained in the inference of cosmological parameters , galactic emission should be accounted for in the data .",
    "the next set of entries in table 1 refers to the dmr maps corrected for galactic emission using the 408 mhz survey to trace synchrotron emission and the dirbe 140 @xmath28 m map to trace dust emission .",
    "free - free emission is removed using a linear combination of the dust- and synchrotron- corrected dmr maps .",
    "this map makes no assumptions as to the distribution of free - free emission , but is relatively noisy compared to the coadded maps , which is reflected in lower significance of all the derived parameters .",
    "the final set of entries refers to the maximally sensitive coadded maps , corrected for galactic emission using the 408 mhz survey to trace synchrotron emission and the dirbe 140 @xmath28 m map to trace both dust and free - free emission .",
    "the fitted values for @xmath10 and @xmath9 are in good agreement for both foreground correction techniques .",
    "one will note that the high latitude foreground correction further reduces the fitted power spectrum amplitude by @xmath81k .",
    "this can not be considered as significant particularly in the light of a similar order of discrepancy between the galactic and ecliptic map maximum likelihood solutions , and especially in comparison with an overall statistical significance of all the determined parameters .",
    "a statistically unbiased technique of power spectrum determination has been used to infer the cmb normalization @xmath8 and power - law index @xmath9 from the _ cobe _ dmr 4-year sky maps .",
    "the sky maps are decomposed in the basis of orthonormal functions on the cut sky into a set of coefficients linear in the pixel temperatures .",
    "these coefficients are then used in a likelihood analysis to infer the parameters of the cmb anisotropy models .",
    "we account for high - latitude galactic emission by using the 408 mhz sky survey to trace the angular distribution of synchrotron emission and the dirbe 140 @xmath28 m map to trace dust emission .",
    "free - free emission is removed using either a linear combination of the dmr maps or using the dirbe map to remove free - free as well as dust emission .",
    "since we find some minor changes in the fitted parameters with the galaxy cut or map pixelization and method of high latitude foreground modeling , a judgement call is required to quote a unique _ cobe _ dmr determination of the primordial power spectrum parameters .",
    "the 4-year data are consistent with quadrupole normalization @xmath82k and power - law index @xmath1 . with @xmath9 fixed at unity we derive the normalization for an exact scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich power spectrum @xmath83k with high ( @xmath84 ) significance @xmath85 .",
