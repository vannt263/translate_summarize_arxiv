    "the recent demonstration of artificial materials ( metamaterials ) with the left oriented triplet of electric @xmath0 , magnetic @xmath1 and wave vector @xmath2 of electromagnetic field  @xcite stimulated studies of nonlinear optical phenomena in such materials  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear dynamics of extremely short optical pulses in left - handed materials was the subject of particular interest in several recent papers  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental realization of the left - handed property based on the resonant response of the artificial material to both electric and magnetic fields was described in  @xcite . to mention just one of the latest experimental achievements ,",

    "the case of extremely short electromagnetic pulses offers a new type of nonlinear interaction , when different frequency components of electromagnetic pulses have different orientations of the @xmath4 triplets .",
    "the design of currently available drm is based upon the use of embedded metallic structures whose size is on the same order as the spatial size of an extremely short electromagnetic pulse .",
    "therefore a theoretical and numerical investigation of the currently existing drm would require 3d computer simulation on maxwell s equations that takes into account the strong inhomogeneity of composite materials .",
    "recently , there have been introduced some qualitatively different approaches to design of drm , including the use of multilevel atoms  @xcite ; the latter gives rise to a spatially homogeneous medium .",
    "possibilities of experimental realizations of such an approach were recently discussed in  @xcite . as a first step in the theoretical investigation of electrodynamics of homogeneous drm in this paper we study a simple model of a homogeneous doubly - resonant medium . even under such simplification ,",

    "the system of equations that describe interaction of coherent light with a medium consisting of molecules ( considered as harmonic oscillators ) is known as the maxwell - lorentz model  @xcite . in this work",
    "we use a version of the maxwell - lorentz system that is extended to account for simultaneous magnetic and electric resonances , with the magnetic susceptibility being linear , while the electric polarization being nonlinear . consider the general form maxwell s equations : @xmath5 for simplicity , we consider transverse electromagnetic plane waves propagating along the @xmath6-axis with the electric field @xmath7 and the magnetic field @xmath8 then the maxwell equations transform to the scalar form : @xmath9 which leads to @xmath10 the system ( [ maxwell ] )",

    "therefore we consider the modeling equation for the medium polarization dynamics in the following form@xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant of anharmonisity . to account for magnetic resonances we use the standard model  @xcite @xmath24 here",
    "@xmath25 is a constant characterizing magnetization .",
