    "patterned microstructures have recently become of particular scientific interest @xcite , as they could provide industry with materials of desired physical properties @xcite . for that purpose",
    ", ion beam mixing seems particularly promising to fabricate materials of desired patterned microstructure @xcite .",
    "however , predicting and controlling the microstructure of irradiated materials still remains an extremely challenging issue .",
    "this firstly relates to the difficulty to estimate ballistic effects of displacement cascades , identified as the main driving force in patterning occurrence @xcite .",
    "the general purpose of this study is to compute these ballistic effects , providing with a first step toward microstructure control .",
    "this requires to simulate displacement cascades initiated by ion irradiation .",
    "this is usually achieved using molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite .",
    "yet , this approach suffers from limitations , as it can barely handle more than @xmath0 atoms dynamics on massive parallel computing facilities , restraining incident ion energy to a few hundred kev @xcite .",
    "still , previous studies suggested that incident energies up to a few mev were required to achieve stationary patterning in binary alloys @xcite , so that this kind of problems is currently beyond reaching for md .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite , that this technological obstacle in the computation of ballistic effects could be skirted , using the ion mixing formalism @xcite .",
    "this framework relies upon the  idea that displacement cascades act on a very different time scale from the microstructure evolution .",
    "the microstructure is hence mainly sensitive to averaged effects of multiple cascades covering one another . as a result , the spatial heterogeneity of displacement cascades due to highly perturbed zones called subcascades ,",
    "can be passed over . from this point ,",
    "ballistic effects can be characterized by the sole mean of average features of displacement cascades : the atomic relocation frequency @xmath1 , and the probability distribution @xmath2 for impinged atom to be relocated at a distance @xmath3 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "particles individual trajectories within the cascade can be passed over . from this observation",
    "arose the idea to turn towards the binary collision approximation framework @xcite for high energies , as it allows up to @xmath4 times faster simulations than md @xcite , at the price of the loss of the time scale of the cascade .",
    "bca codes can be divided into monte carlo based algorithm such as srim @xcite , and deterministic codes such as marlowe @xcite .",
    "srim was essentially designed to simulate amorphous media , due to the probabilistic estimation of the scattering and time integral for binary collisions . on the contrary",
    ", marlowe generates the crystalline structure of the material in a small neighbourhood of the followed particle @xcite , and can hence account for replacement sequences , focusons and channeling effects .",
    "the purpose of this work is to estimate the ballistic effects of ion beam irradiation on crystalline materials , using the ion mixing formalism .",
    "more specifically , the first objective is to show that bca code marlowe can provide with reliable estimations of ballistic effects in pure copper , consistently with molecular dynamics for moderate energies , provided a rational parameter setting has been performed upstream .",
    "the second objective is to compute ballistic effects in the silver copper alloy under 1 mev krypton ions , as such initial energy is beyond the scope of md simulations .",
    "the general motivation is the eventual development of multi - scale methods to link ion irradiation to patterned microstructure of materials at micron scale @xcite .",
    "this study is structured as follows .",
    "first , the ion mixing formalism is briefly presented , and our rational parametrization of marlowe is detailed .",
    "secondly , based on these settings , a first set of simulations is proposed , where the results from our marlowe and md simulations are compared , for a copper single crystal with moderate initial energies .",
    "this section allows to validate marlowe simulations , and provides with solid basis for the following simulations .",
    "then , the case of agcu immiscible alloy subjected to krypton ions ( 1 mev ) is studied using marlowe , as previous numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite works suggested that ballistic displacements could lead to patterning effects in that case .",
    "results are compared to experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite studies , and then discussed from the angle of multi - scale studies on patterned microstructure induced by ion beam irradiation .",
    "displacement cascades act on a very different time scale ( @xmath5 s ) from microstructure diffusion dynamics ( @xmath6 s ) @xcite . for a sufficient irradiation flux @xmath7",
    ", numerous cascades hence occur during a fundamental time increment of the microstructure .",
    "this suggests to define an average cascade over this sample of single cascades .",
    "only the effects of this virtual cascade impact the microstructure @xcite .",
    "albeit strongly heterogeneous when considered singly , due to subcascades spontaneous formation above a certain threshold for the initial energy @xcite , the average cascade can be considered homogeneous .",
    "this assumption requires that subcascades perform a covering of the average cascade s volume .",
    "the necessary condition for subcascades covering is that the estimate of the covering volume fraction @xmath8 , exceeds the percolation threshold @xmath9 in dimension 3 @xcite :    @xmath10    here , @xmath11 is the average number of subcascades per cascade , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the average characteristic sizes of cascades and subcascades , respectively . for a spherical average cascade ,",
    "@xmath12 is the diameter of the circular section . by extension , for an ellipsoidal average cascade @xcite",
    ", @xmath12 is defined correspondingly , from a virtual sphere of same volume as the cascade .",
    "the same definition goes for subcascades with @xmath13 .    from this point ,",
    "ballistic effects are only defined by an atomic relocation frequency @xmath1 , and a probability distribution @xmath2 for an impinged atom to be relocated at a distance @xmath3 from its initial position .",
    "this probability @xmath2 is usually assumed to follow an exponential decay @xcite , associated to short range displacements within subcascades :    @xmath14    here , @xmath15 is the mean relocation distance , associated to finite range disordering . as for @xmath1",
    ", it is the product of the irradiation flux @xmath7 , and a relocation macroscopic cross section @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is defined as the characteristic surface @xmath17 of the cascade , weighed by an atomic displacement efficiency .",
    "this relocation efficiency is the fraction of relocated atoms @xmath18 , among all atoms in the volume of the cascade .",
    "@xmath1 thus eventually reads :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the crystallographic lattice cell volume , and @xmath21 is the number of atoms per lattice cell .",
    "this study focuses on the number of displaced atoms @xmath18 , as well as the characteristic size of cascades @xmath12 as they are both required to estimate the relocation frequency @xmath1 , and the relocation distribution of displaced atoms @xmath2 .",
    "particular attention is also paid to the percolation criterion eq .",
    ", as required by the ion mixing theory .",
    "the first parameter governing collisions is the limit impact parameter @xmath22 for collision candidate atoms . in a pure binary collision approximation",
    ", this coefficient should ensure that collisions are isolated .",
    "face centered cubic lattices require @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , corresponding to half distance between nearest neighbours , @xmath25 being the lattice parameter . yet",
    ", this choice leads to overextended linear collision sequences @xcite , as @xmath22 is also involved in collision proposal wherein no interaction occur but electronic stopping . for a fcc lattice ,",
    "the second closest neighbours at least must be taken into account , leading to @xmath26 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "note higher values for @xmath22 step up the occurrence of multiple collision , eventually leading to an overestimation of the amount of relocated atoms by marlowe .",
    "nevertheless , in case a replacement sequence is initiated , @xmath22 is then denoted @xmath27 , and the neighbours among the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions must be accounted for , so that @xmath31 . this choice allows the electronic stopping generated by neighbouring parallel atomic rows to help dissipate the linear collision sequence energy .",
    "the second parameter is the binding energy @xmath32 above which the target atom is set in motion , and a vacancy is created , albeit potentially unstable . the most physical choice is the enthalpy of vacancy formation of the material .",
    "this enthalpy is available in the literature for pure materials @xcite . in the case of alloys",
    ", the alloy formation energy must be added .",
    "these have been estimated via modified embedded atom method ( meam ) potentials @xcite , or experimentally @xcite . however",
    ", this energy is overestimated in the case of linear collisions sequences ( lcr ) such as replacement sequences and focusons , as it is intuitively less expensive to switch atoms , than to eject an atom from its site thus leaving it vacant .",
    "robinson suggested that this replacement binding energy should be about a tenth of the binding energy : @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this assertion was checked in the @xmath28 crystallographic direction , as it is the most favourable direction for replacement sequences in fcc crystals . for that purpose ,",
