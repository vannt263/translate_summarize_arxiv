    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) , which is  somewhat confusingly  also called `` 3d '' or `` tri - dimensional '' spectroscopy  , `` two - dimensional '' or `` area '' spectroscopy and so forth , and which is known in other areas beyond astronomy under terms like e.g.  `` hyperspectral imaging '' , is a powerful observing technique that has been introduced and refined over the past two decades .",
    "it is now at the verge of becoming a standard tool , which is available at most modern telescopes @xcite . for practical reasons ,",
    "some users have , furthermore , adopted the intuitively descriptive terminology `` 3d '' as a reference to the datacube , which is thought to be the product of an observation ( cf .",
    "[ datacube ] ) .",
    "spectra.,width=302 ]    ifs is an astronomical observing method that in a single exposure creates spectra of ( typically many ) spatial elements ( `` spaxels '' ) simultaneously over a two - dimensional field - of - view ( fov ) on the sky . owing to this sampling method",
    ", each spaxel can be associated with its individual spectrum .",
    "once all of the spectra have been extracted from the detector frame , in the data - reduction process , it is possible to reconstruct maps at arbitrary wavelengths . for instruments with an orthonormal spatial sampling geometry",
    ", the spectra can be arranged on the computer to form a three - dimensional array , which is most commonly called a `` _ _ datacube _ _ '' .",
    "datacubes are also well - known as the natural data product in radio astronomy . however , there are many integral field spectrographs which do not sample the sky in an orthonormal system . in this case",
    "the term datacube is misleading .",
    "also , atmospheric effects , in particular in the optical wavelength regime , make the term inappropriate in the most general case .    instruments that create three - dimensional datasets in the above mentioned sense , however not simultaneously but rather in some process of sequential data acquisition ( scanning )  e.g.  tunable filter ( fabry - perot ) instruments , scanning long - slits , etc .   are not strictly 3d spectrographs according to this definition .",
    "integral field spectrographs have been built based on different methods of dissecting the fov into spaxels , e.g.  optical fiber bundles , lens arrays , optical fibers coupled to lens arrays , or slicers ( fig .",
    "[ ifutypes ] ) .",
    "the term _ spaxel _ was introduced in order to distinguish spatial elements in the image plane of the _ telescope _ from _ pixels _ , which are the spatial elements in the image plane of the _ detector _",
    "the optical elements that accomplish the sampling of the sky are often called `` integral field units '' ( ifus ) , and ifs is also sometimes called `` ifu spectroscopy '' .",
    "spaxels can have different shapes and sizes , depending on instrumental details and the type of ifu ( fig .",
    "[ spaxels ] ) .",
    "contrary to the persuasive implication of the datacube picture , ifus do not necessarily sample the sky on a regular grid : e.g.  fiber bundles , where , due to the manufacturing process , individual fibers can not be arranged to arbitrary precision . even if the manufacture of an ifu allows to create a perfectly regular sampling pattern , e.g.  in the case of a hexagonal lens array ,",
    "the sampling is not necessarily orthonormal .",
    "moreover , real optical systems create aberrations and , sometimes , non - negligible field distortions , in which case the spectra extracted from the detector do not sample an orthogonal fov on the sky . furthermore , the sampling method may be contiguous ( e.g.  lens array ) fith a fill factor very close to unity , or non - contiguous ( e.g.  fiber bundle ) with a fill factor of significantly less than 100% . in all of these cases , it is possible to reconstruct maps at a given wavelength through some process of interpolation and , repeating this procedure over all wavelengths , to convert the result into a datacube .",
    "note , however , that interpolation often produces artifacts and generally involves loss of information .",
    "+          the generic data product from ifs is a set of spectra , which are associated with a corresponding set of spaxel positions .",
    "the spaxel coordinate system may or may not be ortho - normal , but in the most general case it is not .",
    "it is only through the process of interpolation in the spatial coordinate system that arbitrary ifu geometries are converted to ortho - normal , i.e. a datacube compatible form .",
    "interpolation , however , inevitably incurs loss of information .",
    "therefore the euro3d consortium has introduced a special data format for transportation of reduced 3d data which is different from the seemingly simple application of the standard fits naxis=3 format , which is suitable e.g.  for radio astronomy @xcite .",
    "the euro3d data format @xcite avoids this latter step of interpolation and assumes only that the basic steps of data reduction have been applied to remove the instrumental signature , but else presenting the data as a set of spectra with corresponding positions on the sky .",
    "this approach leaves spatial interpolation and the creation of maps the process of data visualization and analysis , i.e.  under control of the user .",
    "figure  [ euro3ddataformat ] illustrates the spaxel - oriented approach of the euro3d fits data format .",
    "the visualization of ifs data is confronted with two fundamental requirements : the _ inspection _ of data for the purpose of monitoring data quality and correcting defects , and the _ analysis _ of data , i.e. the derivation of physically meaningful quantities .",
    "ideally , a visualization tool should support both . while the former issue requires to preferentially look into _ basic elements _ of a dataset  for example to identify detector faults that mimic a signal , to check the correctness of the various calibration steps ( bias subtraction , flat - field and wavelength calibration , extraction of spectra ) and so forth  the latter addresses several possible projections of the data set .",
    "for example , the user is often interested in obtaining a _ map _ at one or several wavelengths over the fov , corresponding , for example , to emission lines of an extended gaseous object  in order to create line ratio maps , from which one can derive quantities like electron temperature , density , dust extinction etc . on the other hand , for a subset of spaxels that cover a peculiar object , one might wish to co - add the flux within a user - defined aperture , and plot the resulting _ spectrum_.    the p3d software @xcite is a versatile data reduction package for optical fiber based 3d instruments , which contains a visualization tool that supports a variety of these needs .",
    "its capabilities are illustrated in figs .",
