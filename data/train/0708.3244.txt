    "what happens if people meet and discuss their opinions regarding a political party , a brand , or a new product ?",
    "generally , when people meet they influence one another and as a consequence may change their opinions .",
    "such opinion formation processes are at the heart of models that explain voting behavior as well as models of innovation diffusion ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "if people who are assumed to have opinions toward something meet and discuss , they may adapt their opinions towards the other agent s opinion and reach a compromise or they may move away from consensus when their initial positions are too different as well as they could ignore each other . for simplification",
    "we only consider one - dimensional opinions such that they can be represented by real numbers between zero and one .",
    "we will only examine compromising agents under bounded confidence , which implies that individuals who differ too much in their opinions do not affect and thus ignore each other .",
    "this assumption mirrors the psychological concept of selective exposure , where people tend to perceive their environment in favor of their own opinions and thereby avoid communication with people with conflicting opinions .",
    "however , if agents do not ignore each other , then they get closer in their opinions . such systems of agents , who update their opinions via averaging with other sufficiently similar opinions , are referred to as systems of _ continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence_. models following this paradigm were proposed by hegselmann and krause @xcite and weisbuch , deffuant , and others @xcite . in the hegselmann and krause model ( hk model )",
    "every agent perceives the opinions of every other agent and builds his new opinion as an average of sufficiently close opinions .",
    "thereby hegselmann and krause added the assumption of bounded confidence to a previous linear opinion dynamics model by degroot @xcite .",
    "hegselmann and krause s main question was what conditions related to the bounded confidence , in other words the degree of open mindedness , are necessary for a consensus to be reached .    while in hegselman and krause all agents interact simultaneously , the agents in the model by weisbuch and deffuant ( wd model ) engage in random pairwise encounters .",
    "several other extensions ( e.g.  in @xcite ) and a combination of both models , the hk model and the wd model , @xcite have been analyzed . a model which includes the centrifugal forces of rejecting agents is proposed by jager @xcite .",
    "opinion dynamics models were also examined in incompletely linked networks , for instance in scale - free networks @xcite .    while the conditions necessary for consensus",
    "were already examined regarding the bounded confidence , we will explore conditions affecting the rules of communication in the sense of who talks with whom .",
    "even if we regard a completely linked society as given and thus look at the wd model , this model has an unexplored free parameter in the order of who communicates with whom at what time .",
    "we will call rules that modify this order the _ communication regime_. studying this parameter is the aim of this paper . considering the complexity of human organizations and",
    "the different institutions that foster or manipulate the communication regime , makes immediately clear why this question is of relevance .",
    "we will see that although the bounds of confidence have a significant impact also the factors that control the communication regime significantly affect the emergence of consensus or dissent .",
    "thus , our two leading questions are : to what extent does the communication regime matter ?",
    "do individual communication rules like being balancing or being curious matter ? to focus our analysis we concentrate on possibilities and strategies to foster or prevent consensus .",
    "the above - mentioned models on opinion dynamics , i.e. wd model and hk model , were previously studied with the more general technique of differential equations on density based state spaces instead of single agents in finite populations@xcite .",
    "however , we will apply these questions to populations of finite size , more precisely , less than one thousand members .",
    "this prevents us from using such general techniques that abstract from single agents .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting because it is a more realistic assumption .",
    "the model assumes a completely mixed population where everybody has the same chance of interacting with everybody else .",
    "however , in human societies the size of groups , where one can reasonably assume a complete mixing , does not scale arbitrarily .",
    "for instance , zhou et al .",
    "@xcite and hill and dunbar @xcite argue that some group sizes are more frequently observed than others and that at certain critical number , groups exhibit significantly different properties in , for instance , their communication patterns .",
    "the organizational literature also suggests that beyond critical sizes , hierarchies will be established .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of people across different geographical locations also restricts the set of potential interaction partners .",
    "all these aspects suggest that for very large systems the assumption of completely mixed societies is strongly violated .",
    "we believe that these arguments demonstrate the necessity of investigating finitely sized groups if one sticks to the complete mixing assumption .",
    "although finite size is often associated with a difficult analysis , we will demonstrate that for opinion dynamics this approach in some circumstances still lends itself to an analytical approach .",
    "after a short introduction of the weisbuch and deffuant model , we answer the question concerning the extent to which the communication regime is able to enforce or prevent consensus .",
    "we will see that the results of deffuant , weisbuch , and others are not robust against manipulation of the communication order .",
    "the result on preventing consensus supports fortunato s claim of universality of the threshold for complete consensus @xcite .",
    "fortunato provides simulation - based evidence that consensus is reached for @xmath2 irrespective of the structure of an underlying connected social network .",
    "our result will explicitly define a threshold such that for larger bounds of confidence consensus can not be prevented . in this way the simulation results by fortunato are formally proved without any simulation , but in the limit of large numbers of agents and uniformly distributed initial opinions .",
    "however , we also show how the result differs for populations of different finite sizes .",
    "for instance , for @xmath1 below a specific level there is a zero probability of consensus in finite populations , while the level depends on the groups size and the cautiousness of agents .",
    "the communication regime we construct in section [ sec : math ] to reach the extreme bounds for preventing and enforcing consensus relies on full knowledge of the opinions of all agents . to circumvent this , in section",
    "[ sec : sim ] we run a simulation analysis with individual strategies , where agents are either balancing or curious .",
    "this only requires that agents know their individual recent communication history .",
    "balancing means that an agent who has talked with somebody who has a higher opinion seeks later on somebody with a lower one .",
    "curious means that agents seek partners with opinion in the same direction as those of their former communication partners .",
    "particularly the interplay of these strategies with the cautiousness that agents exhibit is interesting .",
    "we will see that these very simple communication strategies , that could reasonably be applied by humans , can significantly increase the chances for consensus .",
    "we analyze the model of continuous opinion dynamics that was introduced by weisbuch , deffuant , and others @xcite .",
    "the dynamics are driven by random encounters of two agents , who compromise if their distance in opinions is below a certain bound of confidence @xmath1 .",
    "the model always converges to a stabilized opinion formation , where agents in the same cluster have the same opinion in the long run @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath3 agents , who each have an opinion that is represented by a real number .",
    "the opinion of agent @xmath4 at time step @xmath5 is represented by @xmath6 .",
    "we call the vector @xmath7 the _ opinion profile _ at time step @xmath8 .",
    "given an initial opinion profile @xmath9 , a bound of confidence @xmath10 , and a cautiousness parameter @xmath110,0.5]$ ] we define the _ wd model _ as a process of opinion dynamics as the random process @xmath12 that chooses in each time step @xmath5 two agents @xmath13 and @xmath14 randomly and equally distributed from the set of agents @xmath15 .",
    "agents @xmath13 and @xmath14 perform the action @xmath16    the bound of confidence @xmath1 was previously shown to be the most significant parameter to control the number of emerging clusters .",
    "for randomly distributed initial profiles with opinions between zero and one @xmath17^n$ ] and @xmath18 it is shown via simulations that consensus is reached nearly in every case for @xmath19 @xcite . for lower @xmath1",
    "the usual outcome is polarization into a certain number of opinion clusters .",
    "weisbuch , deffuant et al .  derived by computer simulation the @xmath20-rule , which states that the number of surviving clusters is roughly the integer part of @xmath20 .",
    "the cautiousness parameter @xmath21 had been considered to have no effect on clustering in the basic model ( only on convergence time ) @xcite .",
    "however , there is already some evidence that @xmath21 can affect the clustering as well as that the effect of @xmath21 interacts with other parameters , e.g. number of agents that participate in an interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different random initial profiles may lead to different numbers of clusters , and even the same initial profile may lead to different numbers of clusters for different random choices of communicating pairs . in most previous studies the dependence on the initial profile and on the communication regime is not considered due to the randomness assumption . in the next section",
    "we will incorporate both , initial opinion profile and communication regime , to examine the bounds for enforcing and preventing consensus .",
    "in this section we give mathematical answers to the questions : how small may @xmath1 be such that enforcing consensus is still possible ?",
    "how large may @xmath1 be such that preventing consensus is still possible ?",
    "let our initial opinion profile @xmath22 and the parameter @xmath21 be fixed .",
    "we define @xmath23 as the smallest value of epsilon for which there is a communication regime that leads to a consensus .",
    "obviously , @xmath23 depends on the initial opinion profile and perhaps on @xmath21",
    ". we will give a lower and an upper limit for @xmath23 based on a communication regime that looks like a phone chain of those persons with the most similar opinions , or in other words a _ phone chain of closest_.    for our approximation we must take a detailed look at the initial opinion profile . for this reason we regard our initial opinion profile @xmath22 as ordered such that @xmath24 , without loss of generality . for our considerations",
    "it is useful to look at the gaps between the opinions .",
    "we define for @xmath25 the gap to the next neighbor as @xmath26 .",
    "if we regard an opinion profile as a function @xmath27 then we can consider @xmath28 as the discrete derivative of @xmath29 with respect to the agent index @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath30 is thus not a differential but a difference operator . for abbreviation we further define the _ maximal gap _ @xmath31 . in our setting with",
    "ordered initial opinions , the function @xmath32 is monotonously increasing .",
    "thus its difference function @xmath33 is non - negative .",
    "we are now able to define the _ phone chain of closest _ as a communication regime , which will later on guide us to a fair approximation of @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of agents . a wd model of opinion dynamics",
    "is ruled by a _",
    "phone chain of closest _ if the communicating agents at time step @xmath34 are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the phone chain of closest is @xmath37 and so forth .",
    "this sequencing communication strategy provides a nice proof for the following proposition .",

    "it holds that @xmath38    for a proof see appendix [ proof1 ] .",
    "figure [ figchain ] shows how the phone chain of closest works .",
    "is still open . ]",
    "if we define @xmath39 and @xmath40 as rounding a real value to the upper integer , then we can derive a corollary with a simpler but not as sharp bound .",
    "if proposition 1 holds , then it also holds that @xmath41    for a proof see appendix [ proofcor ] .    from corollary 1",
    "one can see that @xmath23 is determined mostly by the maximal gap , @xmath21 , and the ratio of the maximal gap and the difference between the two most extreme opinions in the initial profile . for @xmath42",
    "the estimate shows , that enforcing consensus is always possible for @xmath1 which is twice the maximal gap of the initial profile .",
    "simulation - based studies often use initial profiles @xmath43^n$ ] with random and uniformly distributed opinions",
    ". the length of the maximal gap in such a profile can be estimated by whitworth s formula ( [ whitworth ] ) and is thereby dependent on the number of agents .",
    "@xmath44    in terms of statistical theory the formula is about the spacings in an order statistics of @xmath0 independent uniformly distributed random variables ( see @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ figgapmax ] shows the probability that the maximal gap is larger than @xmath1 with @xmath45 $ ] .     for random equally distributed @xmath46 for some @xmath0.,width=377 ]    based on this distribution",
    "it is possible to derive an estimate for the expected size of the maximal gap in an initial opinion profile .",
    "but it gives an additional insight : the larger the population the smaller the expected size of the maximal gap .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that for a very large number of agents who are equally distributed , consensus is possible for extremely low values of @xmath1 .",
    "if we assume that the maximal gap converges to zero as the number of agents increases , then it is possible to reach consensus for every @xmath1 with a large enough number of agents .",
    "however , a reasoning on infinitely many agents is not appropriate since every real society is finite in size .",
    "this finite size assumption is where many analytic approaches reach their limit .",
    "we now ask the other way around : how large may @xmath1 be such that preventing consensus is still possible ?",
    "at first we see that this question is not detailed enough to be interesting .",
    "preventing consensus is obviously possible if we forbid one agent to communicate with all others , e.g. by underlying a disconnected social network .",
    "the right question is : how high may @xmath1 be such that preventing consensus is still possible , even if we switch at some time step to an arbitrary communication regime ?",
    "the biggest possible @xmath1 is called @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be an ordered initial profile and let @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50    for a proof see appendix [ proof2 ] and lemma 1 , which states that the mean opinion is conserved by the process of opinion formation .",
    "if we regard random and uniformly distributed @xmath51 $ ] for an @xmath0 approaching infinity , then @xmath47 is computed as the distance of the central points of two arbitrary disjoint intervals whose union is @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "this proves the fortunato s universality result @xcite by showing that preventing consensus is impossible for a large enough number of connected agents for @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , fortunato delivers evidence that consensus is not possible for @xmath56 as @xmath54 and random pairwise communication regardless of an underlying network topology .",
    "proposition 1 shows that there are specific communication orders that lead the society to consensus even for very low values of @xmath1 for every finite but arbitrarily large number of agents .",
    "however , the probability of obtaining one of these consensus - enforcing communication orders when picking it out of the set of random pairwise communication orders would probably approach zero in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "hence , if we are free to choose or to influence the communication order , then fortunato s claim that consensus is not possible for @xmath56 is disproved .",
    "it remains to prove the impossibility of consensus for @xmath56 under random pairwise communication in the sense that our consensus enforcing communication orders approach a probability of zero as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the interval @xmath57 $ ] is the range where both enforcing and preventing consensus is possible with an appropriate communication regime .",
    "both bounds of the interval depend on the initial profile @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ possibilityrange ] provides some numerical evidence about the possibilities that can be reached with manipulation of the communication regime .",
    "the data in line one come from figure 4 in @xcite ( visually extracted ) with 250 simulation runs with random and equally distributed initial profiles and @xmath58 . for line two",
    "we took 250 randomly chosen and equally distributed profiles with @xmath58 and show the maximal @xmath23 and minimal @xmath47 that occurred in all 250 profiles ( all computed with propositions 1 and 2 ) . enforcing and preventing consensus",
    "was possible in the displayed interval for all 250 selected profiles .",
    "the same is true in line three for @xmath59 .",
    "$ ] ( second darkest gray ) where consensus and polarization occurs ( 1 ) and is possible ( 2 and 3).,width=377 ]    from this figure we can also see that for finite populations and random initial profiles avoiding consensus is possible even for @xmath60 ( in contrast to fortunato ) . the larger the population the smaller @xmath1 can be while still guaranteeing the possibility of consensus .",
    "the larger the population the smaller is the upper limit of @xmath1 for which consensus can be prevented .",
    "in the previous section we applied a mechanism for enforcing consensus that was built on knowledge about all people s opinions . we now want to leave behind this idea of global knowledge and the great master plan for communication and go to agent based strategies , which may also promote consensus .",
    "our agents do not know the opinions of all other agents and thus do not know if they are in the center or at the extremes of the opinion space .",
    "the agents follow rules that only require knowledge of their own communication history .      from the huge set of possible individual communication strategies we focus on balancing and curious agents .",
    "consider an agent who has communicated with another agent and adapted his opinion accordingly .",
    "a _ balancing agent _ will now search for an agent whose opinion is contrary to that of the previous communication partner , while ignoring all other agents .",
    "a _ curious agent _ will instead seek out a new communication partner whose opinion is in line with that of the previous communication partner , again ignoring other agents .    to prevent agents from not finding an agent to compromise with ,",
    "we introduce a new parameter , @xmath61 , which represents a maximal level of frustration . specifically , it is the number of unsuccessful attempts a agent sticks to the rule before abandoning it .",
    "thus , agents are not forced to follow the strategies for ever .",
    "we store relative opinions of potential communication partners , more precisely , the direction , and individual frustration levels for all agents in a vector @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 is negative , then agent @xmath13 wants to compromise with an agent with a lower opinion .",
    "if @xmath63 is positive , then agent @xmath13 wants to compromise with an agent with a higher opinion .",
    "if @xmath63 is zero agent @xmath13 has no preferred direction .",
    "the absolute values of the directions represent the frustration level .",
    "the lower the absolute value the higher is the frustration ; if it reaches zero , then the agents does not care anymore about the direction of potential communication partners .",
    "frustration and direction are additional factors that affect agents tendency to compromise .",
    "agents @xmath13 and @xmath14 only compromise if both agents opinions are in the corresponding set of opinions the other agent looks for , i.e. @xmath64 . if they are not in the set , but are closer than @xmath65 to each other , then they both reduce the absolute value of their frustration levels each by one point .",
    "thus the absolute values of @xmath63 and @xmath66 decrease . after a successful compromise , agents set @xmath63 to @xmath61 with the sign indicating the new search direction .",
    "curious agents differ from balancing agents in the sign of @xmath63 . besides this restriction",
    "we return to random pairwise communication .",
    "the corresponding pseudo - code can be found in [ subsec : dir ] .",
    "societies of balancing and curious agents are essentially identical in their dynamics if @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting to note that after a compromise between two balancing agents we end up with two agents with the same opinion searching in opposite directions ; however , the same applies to curious agents but with agents whose indices are reversed .",
    "thus , clustering outcomes are identical for both balancing and curious agents when @xmath67 .      for both strategies , balancing and curious agents , we ran simulations for the values @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",

    "figure [ figexbal ] shows how balancing agents with an intermediate frustration maximum are positively effected in finding a consensus by being more cautious .",
    "figure [ figexcur ] shows the ambivalent effects of curious agents who are cautious . while a high frustration maximum can foster consensus",
    ", an intermediate frustration maximum may even prevent consensus .",
    "we see that almost every curious agent has to cross the central opinion if curious agents want to reach a consens .",
    "figures [ figexbal ] and [ figexcur ] also illustrate that more chances for consensus by being balancing or curious is always paid by a longer convergence time .",
    "our analytical results describe the possibilities of consensus in the weisbuch and deffuant model and we prove the universality of the consensus threshold in the sense of fortunato @xcite .",
    "both enforcing and preventing consensus is possible in a large interval for values of @xmath1 and we give an impression of how it scales with the number of agents and the cautiousness parameter .",
    "this shows the large impact that the control of communication has on consensus formation in the weisbuch and deffuant model in finite populations .",
    "communication control is a feature of real opinion dynamics , which is to some extent manipulable through organizations .",
    "therefore , our results are of interest for those who aim at designing communication and discussion processes and want to foster consensus or dissent ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "generally , continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence is driven by the opposition of the consensus - promoting force of averaging and the separating force of bounded confidence .",
    "dynamics start at the extremes of the opinion space .",
    "specifically , the most extreme agents move towards less extreme position and thus higher densities of opinions evolves at both extremes .",
    "these two high density regions attract agents from the center and may lead to a split in the opinion range .",
    "we explored by simulation the dynamics of societies where each individual behaves balancing or curious .",
    "balancing agents tend to move in a narrow zigzag around their first opinion , while curious agents tend to move in a wide zigzag exploring almost the whole opinion space .",
    "therefore , both strategies have a tendency to prevent a rapid clustering .",
    "balancing agents do this by seeking input from both sides , which prevents them from quickly being absorbed by a nearby cluster .",
    "curious agents tend to run through and finally break out of a cluster they recently joined .",
    "they tend to explore more of the opinion space . since only the clustering is slowed down , while the overall contraction process of the opinion profile keeps its speed , the chances for consensus are increased .",
    "we further extend the analyses in @xcite on the role of the cautiousness parameter @xmath21 . particularly in the first part of this paper",
    "we see that cautiousness significantly controls the possibility of consensus .",
    "furthermore , the second part of the paper illustrates the intriguing interplay of this parameter with agents communication strategies .    to summarize , if you want your agents to foster consensus by balancing , you should appeal to them to be cautious . if you want them to foster consensus by being curious you should appeal to them not to be cautious , otherwise you may even get a negative effect when agents have a low frustration maximum .",
    "this results from the fact that balancing agents prevent clustering by trying to avoid early absorption into a clusters and thus smaller steps , i.e. smaller @xmath21 , have a positive effect on formation of consensus .",
    "curious agents prevent clustering by getting out of clusters they recently entered ; hence , smaller steps have a negative effect . in general",
    ", the impact of being balancing is higher than that of being curious , yet both individual strategies can foster consensus .",
    "* proof . * the left inequality results from the fact that an @xmath85 can obviously not bridge the maximal gap ; thus , the opinion profile will be divided into the two groups above and below this gap forever , regardless of any communication structure .    to show the right inequality ,",
    "let @xmath86 .",
    "we will show that our specific communication regime , the phone chain of closest , drives the dynamic to a consensus .",
    "first , the phone chain of closest can not change the order of the opinion profile .",
    "thus , it holds for all @xmath5 that @xmath87 .    in a first step",
    "we will look at the @xmath88 first time steps , thus the first phone chain round .",
    "after one round we will see that the maximal gap in @xmath89 has shrunk substantially and we can conclude with an inductive argument .",
    "let us consider that there is no bounded confidence restriction by @xmath1 , thus in every time step two opinions really change ( if they are not already equal ) .",
    "we will derive equations for @xmath90 in the time steps @xmath91 under this assumption .",
    "after that we will see that @xmath1 does not restrict this dynamic .",
    "let @xmath92 be an arbitrary agent .",
    "we focus on @xmath93 the gap between @xmath13 and @xmath94 for all time steps and will deduce formulae only containing values of the initial profile .",
    "agent @xmath13 at time step @xmath95 has communicated recently with agent @xmath95 and will communicate with agent @xmath94 .",
    "thus @xmath96 due to the communication with agent @xmath95 , agent @xmath13 moves towards @xmath95 thus @xmath93 gets larger .",
    "@xmath97 by recursion of ( [ prop1_1 ] ) and ( [ prop1_2 ] ) it follows that @xmath98 going one step further to the communication of @xmath13 and @xmath94 where their opinion gets closer we get the following : @xmath99 we use @xmath100 as an abbreviation for the right hand side of ( [ prop1_3 ] ) which only contains expressions at time step 0 .    in the next step @xmath93 becomes larger as agent @xmath94 moves towards agent @xmath101 .",
