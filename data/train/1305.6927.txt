    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are the nearest well - resolved dwarf galaxies , and for decades they have been an ideal playground for testing stellar and galaxy evolution theories ( e.g. , and @xcite ) , establishing the stellar initial mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ) , metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , studying dust properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) or to test the ( ultimately falsified ) hypothesis of dark matter being comprised of non - luminous compact objects ( e.g. , ) .",
    "such intensively monitored areas are also ideal for finding and studying variable objects . for example",
    ", the third phase of ogle produced the ogle - iii catalog of variable stars ( ogle - iii cvs ) , the largest uniform catalog of variable stars in the mcs with over 175,000 objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of the mcs make them well - suited to test and calibrate cosmological distance indicators ( see @xcite for a review ) , such as eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the tip of the red giant branch ( ) , cepheids ( @xcite ) , rr lyrae ( @xcite ) , cluster main - sequence fitting ( @xcite ) , or red clump stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , more uses for such a huge database of photometric records collected in this region of the sky . with little galactic or mc extinction",
    ", it is in principle straightforward to find supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) behind the mcs .",
    "the challenge , of course , is that while there are @xmath125  quasars / deg@xmath2 with @xmath3  mag , there are over @xmath4 stars / deg@xmath2 in the mcs .",
    "with so many stars of different types , optical color selection methods have too high a false positive rate .",
    "wide area x - ray surveys suffer both from contamination by accreting sources in the mcs and low ( @xmath1  arcmin ) resolution that makes it difficult to correctly identify the optical counterpart .",
    "early searches based on variability lacked robust , quantitative means of distinguishing the aperiodic variability of quasars and stars . despite these difficulties , some @xmath180 quasars had been discovered behind the mcs as of 2009 ( ) , and they were a crucial part of the projects to accurately measure the proper motions of the mcs ( @xcite ) .",
    "now , however , these projects are limited by the lack of a denser reference grid that can be used to better measure and separate the internal and bulk motions of the mcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , expanding the quasar sample by an order of magnitude was probably infeasible using the approaches of these earlier searches .",
    "the first major improvements became possible with the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it allowed mid - ir surveys of the mcs such as the _ surveying the agents of galaxy evolution _",
    "( sage , @xcite ) , _ surveying the agents of galaxy evolution  smc _ ( sage  smc , @xcite ) , and _",
    "spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud _",
    "( s@xmath5mc , @xcite ) projects . at the same time , it was realized in extragalactic surveys that mid - ir colors were a powerful means of distinguishing stars , galaxies and agns  in particular , almost all red mid - ir sources are quasars because they have a flatter spectral energy distribution than the rayleigh - jeans law that ( roughly ) characterizes stars and low redshift galaxies ( @xcite ) . in @xcite , we showed that this was also true in the dense stellar fields of the mcs , particularly with the addition of limits on the ogle - iii ( @xcite ) @xmath6-band - to - mid - ir colors , albeit with some additional contamination from the higher abundances of dusty stars and young stellar objects ( yso ) .",
    "at the same time , @xcite proposed that quasar light curves were well modeled by a stochastic process , the damped random walk ( drw ) , which is characterized by an exponential covariance matrix defined by an asymptotic variance @xmath7 and a time scale @xmath8 . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the mid - ir quasar candidates from @xcite largely lay in a different region of the @xmath7/@xmath8 parameter space from variable stars , thus providing a robust , quantitative means of variability - selecting quasars .",
    "@xcite also ( re)introduced a more statistically powerful method of estimating the drw parameters than used by @xcite , based on the methods previously discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this was then confirmed by @xcite using the sdss variability data on @xmath19000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in sdss stripe 82 agns with extensions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other recent studies on variability - selecting quasars can be found in @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite further showed that the drw parameters are correlated with wavelength , luminosity and black hole mass , and @xcite show that it can fully explain the variability statistics of ensembles of quasars . @xcite and @xcite show that on time scales of days to years the drw model is a better model stochastic process for quasar light curves than many simple variants , although @xcite found for four kepler - monitored agns that the power spectrum may steepen on very short time scales .",
    "the drw model then provides a very well - defined means of carrying out the interpolations needed when cross - correlating light curves , as shown in the reanalysis of quasar reverberation mapping light curves by @xcite , and it could play a similar role in measuring the time delays of lensed quasars ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , who use a stochastic model but not the drw model ) .",
    "a fundamental problem with this renaissance in quasar variability studies is that the sdss stripe 82 light curves are not , in fact , very good , comprising only 60 epochs for each quasar with large temporal gaps .",
    "in fact , the quasars with the best , densely - sampled , long - term light curves , are the quasars behind the mcs , because they have been almost continuously monitored by microlensing projects for over a decade .",
    "the typical quasar has @xmath1500 @xmath6-band and @xmath150 @xmath9-band epochs from ogle - iii ( years 2001 - 2009 ) and @xmath1500 @xmath6-band and @xmath1100 @xmath9-band epochs from ogle - iv ( years 2010 - 2013 ) and the light curves continue to be extended . the superiority of these light curves is likely to remain the case until 10 years after the advent of lsst ( @xcite ) , although pan - starrs ( @xcite ) will provide larger numbers of more sparsely sampled , multi - color light curves .",
    "as noted earlier , denser networks of quasars behind the mcs are also needed for improved proper motion measurements .",
    "we started the _",
    "magellanic quasars survey _ ( mqs ) in 2009 to greatly expand the number of agns behind the mcs using the 3.9 meter anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) and the aaomega spectrograph .",
    "aaomega allows multi - object spectroscopy of @xmath10 targets within a 3 deg@xmath2 field of view ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the runs were plagued by bad weather , we reported the discovery of @xmath11 new agns behind the smc ( doubling their number ) in @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) and the discovery of @xmath12 new agns behind the lmc ( quadrupling their number ) in @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "here , we bring the present phase of the mqs ( spectroscopic confirmations ) to a conclusion , where we have completed all 12 of the planned lmc fields and three out of five of the planned smc fields ( plus the pilot study from paper i ) , confirming a total of 758  agns , which represents an increase in the number of known quasars behind the mcs by almost an order of magnitude . in section  [ sec :",
    "agnsel ] , we describe the agn selection procedures , and in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the data and their analysis .",
    "new agns are presented in section  [ sec : newquasars ] , and the contaminating objects and objects with featureless spectra are described in section  [ sec : contamination ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the relative detection efficiencies of our agn selection methods . the paper is summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] and we outline future areas of exploration .",
    "our main driver for finding agns behind the mcs was to study their variability .",
    "we therefore limited our search to the well - monitored ogle - iii fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "we cross - matched the ogle data with the sage , sage - smc and s@xmath5mc mid - ir data ( @xcite ) and the rosat x - ray catalogs ( ) .",
    "the exact selection procedures are outlined in paper  ii . for completeness",
    ", we briefly sketch these procedures here .    _ method  1 . _ in the first method , we use the mid - ir / optical color - selected agn candidates from @xcite . in the mid - ir color - color space we defined a wedge following @xcite that we further subdivided into region a , which should be free of low temperature ( dusty ) black bodies , and region b which might contain them . then in the mid - ir color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , we defined a region likely to be heavily contaminated with young stellar objects ( yso ) and one which should mostly contain quasars ( qso ) . finally , we defined objects with mid - ir - to - optical colors similar to agns as class `` a '' and those with other colors as class `` b '' .",
    "hence , each object has a classification such as qso - aa ( most pure ) , qso - ab , @xmath13 , yso - ba , or yso - bb ( most contaminated ) . where there was no optical match we assigned a classification of ( q / y)so-(a / b)0 .",
    "_ method  2 . _",
    "our second criterion was variability , and the original intent was simply to use our criteria from @xcite . at the time , however , there was an unresolved problem in the long term ogle - iii light curves involving inter - seasonal jumps in the photometry that then triggered large numbers of false positives when we simply fit the drw model to all available light curves . lacking time to resolve this problem for the full @xmath14  deg@xmath2 survey area , we largely adopted a variant of the @xcite structure function selection method to screen candidates because it was less sensitive to localized jumps .",
    "the resulting cuts were as follows ( as in paper  ii ) :    _ cut 1 . _",
    "the average light curve magnitude is @xmath15  mag for the lmc and @xmath16  mag for the smc .",
    "the faint limit ensures that the data has a high enough signal - to - noise ratio to provide a good light curve and the bright limit eliminates variable stars at fluxes where we have no significant expectation of finding a quasar given the survey area ( see @xcite ) ;    _ cut 2 . _ the light curve must be fit by some drw model better than it is fit by white noise ( @xmath17 , @xcite ) .",
    "this essentially selects sources which are variable due to something other than noise ;    _ cut 3 .",
    "_ we applied a very loose constraint on the drw model time scale ( @xmath18 ) and no constraint on @xmath19 .",
    "the restrictions on @xmath8 removed 62% of the sources , mostly at short time scales .",
    "_ cut 4 . _",
    "the slope of the light curve s structure function was broadly consistent with that of a quasar ( @xmath20 , see @xcite ) ;    _ cut 5 .",
    "_ finally , we also limited the associated @xmath6-band amplitude of the structure function to @xmath21  mag to remove high amplitude variable stars ;    in an ideal world we would have used a `` cleaner '' procedure so that our final discussion of the variability selection results would be simpler . on the other hand , we had no shortage of fibers , so there was no harm in using a rather broad definition for variability - selected candidates . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we also comment on results when applying the original @xcite variability criteria .",
    "_ method  3 .",
    "_ finally , we included variable objects with positions consistent with the location of any rosat x - ray source .",
    "where there were multiple variable sources , the one closest to the x - ray position was included .",
    "the aat / aaomega configure software ( @xcite ) allows assigning priorities to targeted objects , where priority 1 is the lowest and 9 is the highest .",
    "we prioritized our candidates in the following way .",
    "priority 9 was assigned to objects selected by all three methods , priority 8 was assigned to objects meeting any two selection criteria , and priority 7 was assigned to objects selected by a single method . with the availability of fibers , we also included 931 stars ( 286 observed ) that could potentially have been stripped from the 47 tuc globular cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "these stars should be easy to kinematically separate from smc stars even with our relatively low spectral resolution .",
    "these stars were assigned priority 6 , and the results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it is important to realize that we are not trying to produce a very high purity candidate sample because aaomega has a significantly higher density of fibers ( 400/3  deg@xmath22/deg@xmath2 ) than there are @xmath23  mag quasars ( @xmath24/deg@xmath2 ) for which we are likely to measure redshifts given the exposure times and the backgrounds created by the high stellar density and large aperture fibers .",
    "every fiber is ultimately assigned to something that might be a candidate ( modulo the 47 tuc stars ) , although many will be in low purity sub - samples ( e.g. , yso - bb ) or so faint that we will only obtain a redshift if the source has sufficiently strong lines .",
    "contamination is particularly severe for the very brightest ( and rarest ) quasars which both have best light curves and are the most useful for any absorption line studies . by definition",
    ", only 1/4 - 1/3 of our targets can be quasars bright enough to measure a redshift , which means we will also produce a large spectroscopic catalog of dusty or otherwise peculiar stars as a consequence .",
    "the stellar content of the mqs will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the three selection criteria lead to samples of 2434 and 1447 candidates behind the ogle - iii regions of the lmc and smc . for completeness",
    ", we include all mqs sources in our summary tables , but for discussions of efficiencies we exclude the sources from paper i ( where we used somewhat different selection methods ) that did not pass our selection criteria from section  [ sec : agnsel ] .",
    "the basic information on the fields is provided in table  [ tab : mqslog ] and their locations on the sky are shown in figure  [ fig : mqs_fields ] .",
    "the target integration time was 1.5 hours ( @xmath25  minutes ) , and this was obtained for 13 of the 15 completed fields ( table  [ tab : mqslog ] ) .",
    "three of the fields from paper ii had shorter than desired exposure times , but we repeated one of these fields ( lmc4a as field lmc4b ) during the final observing run .",
    "we used the 580v ( blue channel ) and 385r ( red channel ) gratings to provide a resolution of @xmath26 and a spectral range of 37008800 , with the spectra spliced near 5700 .",
    "this broad coverage , low resolution mode is well - suited for agn identification since we are interested in relatively broad , but sparse lines . the data were reduced and calibrated with the standard aaomega 2dfdr routines ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then inspected all the spectra using our own dedicated code for finding agns .",
    "we searched for the common redshifted agn spectral lines ( see e.g. , @xcite ) such as hydrogen ly@xmath27 at 1216 , h@xmath28 at 4101 , h@xmath29 at 4340 , h@xmath30 at 4861 , h@xmath27 at 6563 , magnesium mgii at 2800 , carbon civ at 1549  and ciii ] at 1909 , and also the narrow lines of oxygen [ o ii ] at 3727 , [ o iii ] at 4959  and 5007 .",
    "the agn identification was viewed as confirmed if at least two agn lines were identified , with the exception of the redshift range from @xmath31 where mgii is frequently the only observable line .",
    "we paid special attention to @xmath32 agns , for which incorrect splicing of blue and red spectra at 5700  can mimic mgii line .",
    "we identified a total of 758  quasars , 565  in the lmc and 193  in the smc , from our targeted sample of 2248 lmc and 766 smc sources , including those reported earlier in papers  i and ii . we chose targets independent of any prior identifications .",
    "of the 66 known agns in our observed fields , we selected 48 as candidates , observed 46 and re - confirmed 45  of them ( we discuss the exception below ) , leaving a total of 527  and 186  new mqs quasars behind the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "of the 18 known agn that were not selected as candidates , five were in the pilot field of paper i that was governed by a different set of selection criteria ( although not observed , three of them were included in the current candidate list , the remaining two had incomplete mid - ir colors , no x - ray emission and insignificant optical variability ) .",
    "of the 13 known agn in the observed standard fields , six lacked ( complete ) spitzer photometry , six were not detected by spitzer and one lay outside the mid - ir selection region .",
    "most ( nine ) were not significantly variable , although we did lose one known agn for being `` too variable '' and having a structure function amplitude @xmath33  mag .",
    "three of them were variable but fainter than @xmath34  mag .",
    "all but three had no x - ray counterparts , and these three remaining sources had rosat detection probabilities below the threshold we used for our target selection .",
    "the location of new ( and previously known ) agns on the sky is shown in figure  [ fig : mqs_fields ] , while their basic properties and coordinates are reported in tables  [ tab : results_lmc ] ( lmc ) and [ tab : results_smc ] ( smc ) .",
    "selected spectra of 50 new mqs agns are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "all identified agns had their spectra classified into quality classes : q1 for obvious agn spectra , q2 for relatively obvious agn spectra with problems / contamination , and q3 for just above a borderline , usually low s / n or highly contaminated agn spectra .",
    "there are 372  ( 282 , 90 ) q1 agns behind the mcs ( lmc , smc ) , 299  ( 217 , 82 ) q2 , and 87  ( 66 , 21 ) q3 . for sources brighter than @xmath35 mag , 58% of them are q1 agns , while for sources fainter than this limit only 35% are q1 , simply reflecting decreasing spectra quality with decreasing s / n .",
    "one agn from paper ii , agn mqs  j051509.61@xmath36701711.7 , turned out to be a false positive , where we mis - identified the rest - frame [ oi ] lines at 6300  and 6364  as the [ oiii ] 4959  and 5007   lines at a redshift of @xmath37 , and therefore has been deleted from the final sample .",
    "we inspected all other agns at similar redshifts and found no other mis - identifications .",
    "we were unable to confirm the agn j050550.35@xmath36675017.5 from .",
    "they selected this as an x - ray source from higher resolution ( than rosat ) xmm - newton data , while we selected it as a qso - aa mid - ir candidate . in the ogle - iii images",
    "it is associated with a @xmath38  arcsec , mildly edge - on galaxy that may have a bright nucleus . as such",
    ", the source is almost certainly an agn .",
    "however , assign a redshift of a @xmath39 quasar based on a single noisy line interpreted as h@xmath27 , and we are unable to confirm this redshift or identify an alternative .",
    "we count this source as unconfirmed in our statistical discussions .",
    "this source is marked with a `` @xmath40 '' symbol in figure  [ fig : mqs_fields ] .",
    "there are no high resolution images available from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) archives , so it was not used in any of the hst proper motion studies .",
    "figures  [ fig : qso_color]-[fig : hist_cumul ] summarize various properties of the sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : qso_color ] shows the distribution of observed and expected optical colors as a function of redshift , where we compute the expected colors and @xmath41-corrections using the template agn spectrum from @xcite .",
    "we use galactic / mc extinction corrections from @xcite .",
    "we combine the @xmath41-corrections and the extinction to estimate the absolute magnitude of each agn assuming a standard @xmath42cdm cosmological model with ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) = ( 0.7 , 0.3 , 0.0 ) and h = @xmath46/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.71 to calculate luminosity distances .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the distribution of the agn in absolute @xmath9- ( top ) and @xmath6-band ( middle ) magnitudes along with a histogram of the overall redshift distribution ( bottom ) .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : hist_cumul ] shows the cumulative surface density of the sample as a function of @xmath6-band magnitude .",
    "if we compare this to the sdss @xmath47-band number counts from @xcite , corrected to the ogle @xmath6-band ( shifted by @xmath360.3 mag ) , we see that the mqs sample is roughly @xmath175% complete for @xmath48  mag , which seems quite good given the nature of the survey fields ! some of the incompleteness is associated with regions of very high stellar density , as illustrated by the lower number of quasars directly behind the central regions of the mcs .",
    "the remaining lmc ( smc ) sources can be divided into 1017  ( 344 ) contaminating sources and 667  ( 229 ) objects with featureless spectra , where a contaminating source is clearly some sort of stellar source in the lmc and a featureless spectrum is one where the s / n is simply too poor to propose a classification . in paper",
    "ii , we investigated the nature of the contaminating sources and found that they are typically planetary nebulae ( pne ) , ysos , b / be stars , etc .",
    ", as might be expected from the requirement that they show dust emission , variability or x - ray emission .",
    "the properties of the final larger sample will be explored elsewhere .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_cumul ] compares the cumulative distributions of these sources to that of the agn .",
    "we see that contaminating sources dominate the overall target distribution at bright magnitudes and that featureless sources dominate at faint magnitudes .",
    "essentially , filling the fibers means we can look at all possible bright candidates and gamble that we might identify quasars fainter than @xmath49  mag despite the high effective sky backgrounds .",
    "this leads to a low apparent detection efficiency of @xmath130% , but is really just a consequence of using all available fibers .",
    "we can use the overall sample to explore the various search methods proposed to identify quasars behind the mcs . in some sense",
    ", this question is almost moot , since the mqs has already identified the majority of bright quasars behind the densest regions of the mcs , and the problem becomes simpler in any expansion of the search region because the stellar densities are lower .",
    "these issues would be relevant , however , to attempts to find fainter quasars , although there is no immediately obvious scientific driver for such a search .",
    "table  [ tab : selres ] summarizes the statistics for the various methods , where readers should focus on the differences in efficiencies rather than the absolute efficiencies since the latter are by definition low because of our strategy of using every fiber .    for the present analysis",
    "we will discuss relative completenesses more carefully than in paper  ii .",
    "the extra complication is that we assigned quasars an observational priority based on whether they were selected based on @xmath50 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 methods , so the fraction observed @xmath53 depends on @xmath47 . for @xmath50 and @xmath51 we can assume that the probability of being observed was independent of which methods identified the candidate since that information was not used in setting the priorities . for any particular class of objects ( e.g. , qso - aa )",
    "there were then @xmath54 candidates yielding @xmath55 quasars , so the overall efficiency for the class is @xmath56 \\left [ \\sum_i n_i \\right]^{-1}.\\ ] ] note that the total number of candidates is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of candidates that were observed , so if all priorities were observed with equal probability ( @xmath59 ) the efficiency is simply the number of quasars found divided by the number of objects observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : kk09cuts ] shows the mid - ir selection criteria we introduced in @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : selres ] summarizes the various mid - ir selection groups , where in our discussion we will ignore those with few observed sources ( like yso - ba ) .",
    "as expected , the highest yield is for qso - aa objects ( @xmath129% ) followed by qso - ba ( @xmath124% ) .",
    "much of this is driven by our inclusion of faint sources , and if we restrict the sample to @xmath35  mag ( the bright sample , hereafter ) the efficiency rises to 49% and 51% , respectively .",
    "as expected , the yso regions have lower yields ( @xmath120% ) , and the yields become very low ( @xmath60 ) if a target did not have the typical optical / mid - ir color of quasars in the ages ( @xcite ) survey ( class `` b '' rather than `` a '' ) .",
    "it appears that the distinction between sources along the black - body color track ( class b ) as compared to those off that color track ( class a ) has little effect and could simply be dropped .",
    "overall , the yield for a source satisfying any of the mid - ir criterion was 27% for all sources and 44% for bright sources",
    "( `` mid - ir ( any ) '' in table  [ tab : selres ] ) .",
    "interestingly , if we restrict the sample to mid - ir selected candidates that _ were not _ also selected based on their variability or x - ray properties ( `` mid - ir ( only ) '' ) the overall yield is still 18% ( 27% bright ) .",
    "this means that a large fraction of the mid - ir - selected quasars are not being selected by the variability or x - ray criteria . at least for the latter , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have previously noted that x - ray and mid - ir selection methods tend to select different sources .",
    "we discuss the variability selection results in three parts .",
    "first , we consider variability selection as actually used to select candidates , and then we discuss the consequences of adding the tighter restrictions of either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : o3var ] shows four examples of the ogle - iii light curves of newly identified quasars .    for variability selection as implemented , we started with 50 million mc sources .",
    "after applying _ cuts  1 _ and _ 2 _ ( @xmath17 and @xmath61  mag ) , 680 thousand possibly variable sources remained . adding the restriction on drw time scales ( @xmath18 ) reduced this to 260 thousand sources , and then only 37 thousand sources remained after _",
    "cuts  4 _ and _ 5 _ ( @xmath20 ; @xmath21  mag ) .",
    "there are still large numbers of false positives , primarily `` ghost variables '' where fainter stars pick up a variability signal because they lie in the extended psf wings of brighter variable stars .",
    "after visually inspecting this final list we were left with the @xmath11400 real candidates .",
    "the resulting efficiency is quite good , with 34% of these variability - selected candidates confirmed as agn .",
    "we can not retrospectively impose the exact selection procedures we introduced in @xcite because of the additional selection cuts we introduced in paper ii and continued to use here .",
    "we can , however , examine the effects of the additional restrictions on @xmath8 and @xmath7 from @xcite on the present sample , as shown in figure  [ fig : tau_sigma ] .",
    "it shows the distribution of our confirmed agns in the space for the drw parameters along with the selection region proposed in @xcite . a very high fraction ( 77% ) of all",
    "variability - selected mqs quasars ( 59% of all confirmed agns ) lie in this narrower selection region , as we would also expect given the parameter distribution of the sdss stripe 82 quasars from @xcite .",
    "if we apply the remaining cuts from @xcite on the variability amplitude as a function of magnitude but not the cuts on the ratio of the @xmath9- and @xmath6-band variability amplitudes , 74% of the sample remains ( 58% of all confirmed agns ) .",
    "the level of contamination seen in figure  [ fig : tau_sigma ] looks higher than in @xcite because there we only showed the distribution of other variable sources from the @xmath62  deg@xmath2 analyzed for variability by ogle - ii ( @xcite ) rather than the ogle - iii sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "overall , the yield for variable sources ( equation  [ eqn ] ) is @xmath63 ( `` var ( any ) '' ) , but in this restricted region of the @xmath8-@xmath19 plane ( also using the remaining @xcite cuts ) , it is @xmath64 ( `` var ( any)@xmath65drw '' ) and by definition these are all bright @xmath61  mag sources . almost all the confirmed variability - selected agns were also selected as mid - ir candidates , probably because all they were also required to be relatively bright . as a result , the yield for those that were not also selected as either x - ray or mid - ir candidates is low ( 8% for `` var .",
    "( only ) '' ) .",
    "similarly , we can use the narrow variability selection criteria on @xmath66 and @xmath29 based on the structure function approach from @xcite . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig : schmidt ] , they used the criteria that @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . for these tighter criteria , 48% of the variability - selected sources",
    "were confirmed to be agns and 41% ( 83% ) of the confirmed ( and variability - selected ) agns satisfy the criteria .",
    "the 83% is high because our variability selection method was quite similar to the full procedures from @xcite .",
    "while they never contemplated using their method in dense stellar fields , it works reasonably well .",
    "@xcite selected 2566 agn candidates spread over roughly @xmath70",
    "deg@xmath2 behind the lmc based on their optical variability in the macho survey and then reduced the sample to 663 `` high quality '' candidates based on their optical , mid - ir , and/or x - ray properties . although the macho sample is brighter , with a median magnitude of @xmath71  mag rather than our @xmath72  mag , the @xcite sample has a significantly higher surface density of 31  candidates / deg@xmath2 as compared to 13  candidates / deg@xmath2 for the mqs sample at the same magnitude limit . for comparison ,",
    "the expected surface density of quasars brighter than @xmath73  mag is only 3.2  quasars / deg@xmath2 , which means that the contamination levels in the @xcite variability selected sample are significantly higher than for the mqs samples , with upper limits on the purities of the @xcite and mqs variability - selected samples of order 10% and 25% respectively .",
    "the surface density of the `` high quality '' sample is much lower , and in fact drops below the expected surface density of quasars at fainter magnitudes , indicating that it must be substantially incomplete even if it has little contamination .",
    "there are 248 ( 216 ) matches of their sample ( high quality subset ) to our mqs samples for a matching radius of @xmath74 with 133 ( 131 ) being confirmed quasars .",
    "@xcite attempt to compare their selection methods to ours by contrasting the 131 mqs quasars in the sample of 248 candidates matched to their full sample ( 61% ) to the 7% mqs yield ( paper  ii ) for variability - selected quasars that were neither x - ray nor mid - ir - selected . even if there was an independent spectroscopic follow - up of the @xcite sample , one would need to either compare samples selected based only on variability ( @xmath75 versus 34% for mqs ) or variability - selected samples not selected by other methods ( @xmath76 versus 8% for mqs ) rather than mixing the two possibilities . more fundamentally ,",
    "unless the @xcite selection methods are completely devoid of any new information on whether sources are quasars , the apparent efficiency of the @xcite sub - sample contained in the mqs sample must be higher than the efficiency of the mqs sample as a whole .",
    "in essence , @xcite are adding a fourth selection method and then comparing the completeness of the intersection of ( say ) selection methods @xmath51+@xmath77 to the completeness of selection method @xmath51 alone .",
    "this holds even if both methods are variability selection methods , either independent statistics applied to the same data set or ( as in this case ) different statistics applied to two different data sets .",
    "as we see from figure  [ fig : vennconf ] and table  [ tab : selres ] the completeness obtained from the intersections of selection methods are always markedly higher than those for one method alone . without an independent spectroscopic study of the @xcite sample it is impossible to compare the efficiency of the different selection methods beyond the crude comparison of the surface density of candidates to the surface density of quasars discussed above .",
    "finally , table  [ tab : selres ] shows the effects of using various combinations of the selection methods .",
    "for example , samples that combine mid - ir@xmath65variability , mid - ir@xmath65x - ray and variability@xmath65x - ray have yields of 52% ( 63% ) , 49% ( 65% ) , and 66% ( 71% ) for all ( bright ) sources . in these results",
    "we include objects independent of their status based on the third selection method .",
    "if objects are selected by two methods and not by the third , the yields are generally significantly lower , at 49% ( 61% ) , 32% ( 40% ) , and 43% ( 43% ) , respectively .",
    "the various possible overlapping selection choices are graphically illustrated as a venn diagram in figure  [ fig : vennconf ] .",
    "in this paper , we report the final spectroscopically confirmed agn sample from _ the magellanic quasars survey _  the largest spectroscopic search for mc quasars to date .",
    "we obtained spectra for 2248 ( 766 ) lmc ( smc ) sources and identified 565  ( 193 ) as agns .",
    "we also confirmed 38  ( 7 ) known lmc ( smc ) agns and were unable to confirm one .",
    "the total number of confirmed mqs quasars is 758 , of which 713  are new .",
    "thus , the mqs has increased the number of quasars known behind the mcs by an order of magnitude to an overall total of roughly 800 quasars .",
    "this provides a dense network of proper motion reference points for improving measurements of the internal and bulk proper motions of the mcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and these are the quasars with the best long - term , densely sampled light curves for studying quasar variability physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , 50 quasars brighter than @xmath0  mag enable studies of the absorption by the ism / igm .",
    "we roughly estimate that we have achieved @xmath78 completeness for @xmath48  mag quasars in the ogle - iii regions of the mcs .",
    "the nature of the aaomega instrument , with many more fibers than needed given the numbers of quasars brighter than our effective magnitude limit of @xmath79  mag , means that we also obtain spectra of many contaminating lmc sources . because we only target sources that have `` abnormal '' properties for stars , the contaminating sources are a mixture of dusty or accreting sources , including many ysos , pne and be stars .",
    "these sources will be discussed elsewhere . despite fully populating the fibers , the yields from the various selection methods are quite good , particularly when combined .",
    "individual methods typically have yields of order 30% , combinations of two methods have yields of order 55% and combining all three has a yield of 70% .",
    "of course , the number of available targets also declines , and the overall number of agn identified by only one , two or all three methods is 331 , 357 , and 69 , respectively , because of the usual trade - offs between completeness and contamination . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we argued that mid - ir and variability selection methods would be effective despite the high stellar densities of the mcs , and the mqs provides excellent confirmation .",
    "since ogle - iii covered the densest regions of the mcs , expanding the search for quasars to the larger ogle - iv region will be significantly easier because of the reduced stellar densities .",
    "doing so , however , requires somewhat longer term ogle - iv light curves to carry out the variability selection since the mid - ir and x - ray surveys of the mcs do not extend over the much larger ogle - iv survey regions .",
    "this research is based on observations made with the anglo - australian telescope , for which the observing time was granted by the optical infrared coordination network for astronomy ( opticon ) .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
