    "one of the most promising applications of carbon - based new materials like carbon nanotubes or graphene is the area of transparent conducting layers.@xcite carbon - based materials have many advantages over widely used oxides like indium tin oxide ( ito ) in terms of better flexibility and no toxicity ; however , their basic optical and electrical properties have not reached those of conventional transparent conductors so far .",
    "the field has been broadened recently by the possibility of separating nanotubes by electronic type.@xcite by this method , not only highly enriched semiconducting or metallic networks can be prepared , but also extremely purified mixed samples.@xcite    these samples offer a unique opportunity to study the role of intrinsic conductivity vs. intertube contacts in nanotube networks.@xcite intertube connections have been studied previously on junctions built from individual nanotubes@xcite with similar or dissimilar electronic character ( ss , mm or sm , respectively , where m stands for metallic and s for semiconducting tube ) . in macroscopic networks containing predominantly one type of nanotube , and by measuring both the transport and frequency - dependent conductivity , these roles can be even more precisely determined .",
    "impedance studies by garrett et al.@xcite showed that above a characteristic frequency of the order of khz , the values reflect the intrabundle conductance instead of the combined values of bundles and junctions that is measured by the dc method .",
    "thus infrared spectroscopy , which starts at a few thz , clearly yields the intrinsic conductivity of the bundled nanotubes .    in this paper",
    ", we report the transparent and conducting properties of separated metallic and semiconducting single - walled nanotube ( swnt ) films and compare them to those of an ultrahigh purity reference sample .",
    "the contactless measurement of the frequency - dependent conductivity and the four - point dc transport results on the same material can be directly related and the role of intrinsic conductivity vs. that of intertube contacts established .",
    "we also study the effect of doping on the transport and optical properties . in order to improve the conductivity and avoid chemical reactions at defects , we use mild p - doping by nitric acid vapor at room temperature.@xcite as this procedure",
    "is shown to result in a doped state unstable over time , it is only regarded as a proof - of - concept experiment .",
    "nevertheless , two important practical questions can be addressed : 1 . if we find a stable doping method , which kind of tubes should be used to obtain the best transparent conducting properties ; 2 .",
    "if stability is required over optimal conducting properties , which kind is the most stable against accidental doping ?",
    "we find the answer by comparing optical transmittance and dc conductivity measurements on all three kinds of samples .",
    "we used very high purity swnt samples commercialized by nanointegris.@xcite starting material was arc - discharge p2 by carbonsolutions.@xcite separation of the nanotubes was performed by density gradient ultracentrifugation ( dgu),@xcite resulting in separated metallic and semiconducting samples with 95% nominal purity , and a mixed ( reference ) sample with 99% swnt content . for the latter , we assume a composition of 1/3 metallic and 2/3 semiconducting tubes .",
    "( the fact that all three samples underwent identical treatment starting from the original p2 material ensures that extrinsic factors due to sonication and other steps do not influence the comparison .",
    "these effects were extensively discussed in ref .  . )",
    "the mean diameter of the nanotubes is 1.4 nm and their length varies from 100  nm to 4  @xmath1 m . from the aqueous suspensions of surfactant - covered nanotubes we have prepared samples of different thickness using vacuum filtration@xcite through an acetone soluble filter .",
    "the thickness of the films was controlled by the applied amount of solution .",
    "these layers ( three of each sample , differing in thickness ) were subsequently relocated over a 1  cm x 1  cm x 1  mm quartz ( suprasil ) substrate . to remove any remnant of the solvent and traces of accidental atmospheric doping",
    ", the samples were annealed at 200@xmath2c for 13h .",
    "self - supporting thin films were prepared by stretching the nanotube layer over a hole created in a graphite disk .",
    "using this kind of samples enables us to measure transmission without the perturbation caused by substrates and to calculate easily the optical functions from transmission.@xcite    doping of the films was performed by subjecting them to nitric acid vapor overnight at room temperature .",
    "this mild treatment causes hole doping in the @xmath3-electron system,@xcite without converting sp@xmath4 carbon atoms into sp@xmath5 by carboxylic group addition.@xcite    scattering type near - field infrared microscopy ( s - snom ) were taken with a neasnom nano - ftir instrument ( neaspec gmbh ) using a quantum cascade laser with 10.5 @xmath1 m central wavelength .",
    "the s - snom technique is described in detail elsewhere.@xcite briefly , the s - snom uses a metal coated afm tip with the radius of curvature of  20 nm enabling the operation at ultrahigh spatial resolution and near - field interaction between the illuminated tip and the sample.@xcite besides the usual afm topography data the interferometric detection of the optical signal reveals local optical information including the absolute scattering efficiency ( amplitude ) as well as phase of the scattering.@xcite the observed optical contrasts are strongly related to the complex dielectric function of the studied material.@xcite    wide range ( far - infrared through ultraviolet ) optical measurements were performed on the self - supporting nanotube networks using the following spectrometers : a bruker ifs 66v / s fourier - transform ( ftir ) interferometer for the far - infrared ( fir ) and mid - infrared ( mir ) range , a bruker tensor 37 ftir in the near infrared ( nir ) , and an ocean optics qe65000 instrument for the ultraviolet - visible ( uv - vis ) region . in the case of samples on quartz substrate , only data from the uv - vis range were collected to obtain the transmission value at 550 nm ( 18180 @xmath6 ) .    for each nanotube network on the quartz substrate ,",
    "we measured the four - point resistivity using a keithley 192 digital multimeter , and calculated their sheet resistivity ( @xmath7 ) applying the van der pauw formula.@xcite small dots of colloidal silver were used for contacting the samples .",
    "all measurements were performed at room temperature .",
    "thickness of the self - supporting films was measured by atomic force microscopy following the procedure described in ref .  .",
    "from the thickness and the spectra of each type of network , we determined the absorption coefficient at 550 nm and used these values to estimate the thickness of the samples used for resistivity , in order to determine the conductivity values .",
    "the absorption coefficients measured on the undoped samples are 3.39@xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath6 ( r ) , 3.18@xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath6 ( s ) , and 2.36@xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath6 ( m ) , respectively .",
    "these values compare very well with those measured earlier on laser - deposited films prepared by the same procedure.@xcite",
    "figure [ fig : afm ] shows the local structure of the films of all three types .",
    "all films consist of bundles with about 50 nm average thickness as seen in both the topographic and optical images .",
    "the s - snom technique results in both amplitude and phase values of the scattered infrared light .",
    "the frequency range of the infrared laser is 955 - 1030 @xmath6 , where the exciting radiation interacts with the free ( drude ) carriers from the metallic nanotubes .",
    "both amplitude and phase show a remarkable uniformity , proving the high purity of our samples .",
    "additionally , the scattering amplitude from the metallic samples was found to be consistently higher than that from the semiconducting ones , at four distinct wavelengths , 970 , 985 , 1000 and 1015 @xmath6 , indicating higher conductivity .",

    "[ fig : trans ] .",
    "these wide - range spectra prove that separation is effective : in the semiconducting sample the s@xmath10 and s@xmath11 transitions are very intense , while the m@xmath10 transition can hardly be seen ; in the case of the metallic sample the intensity of the m@xmath10 transition is high and the peaks representing the transitions of semiconducting nanotubes are weak .",
    "the intrinsic frequency - dependent conductivity can be calculated from the wide - range spectra and the thickness of the films by kramers - kronig transformation of the transmittance@xcite and contributions from individual transitions can be determined by the fitting procedure given in ref . .",

    "( the appearance of the new transmission minimum between s@xmath10 and s@xmath11 is most probably originating in excitonic effects@xcite and will be discussed elsewhere . ) in addition , in all three samples the far - infrared transmission is decreasing , due to the free carriers introduced by doping.@xcite     frequency - dependent optical conductivity of doped and undoped nanotube films .",

    "note the logarithmic frequency scale .",
    "squares with error bars represent measured dc conductivity values.,width=321 ]    figure [ fig : cond ] shows the wide - range optical conductivity curves of all doped and undoped samples . the most striking difference ( apart from the interband transitions ) appears below 2000 @xmath6 : all doped samples have a strong drude contribution to the optical conductivity and therefore can be considered metals . for comparison",
    "we also show the dc conductivity of the samples from fig .",
    "[ fig : cond1 ] obtained by averaging the respective data shown in table [ tab : cond ] .",
    "the low - frequency conductivity scales qualitatively with that obtained from the transport measurements , the latter being consistently lower , as expected for a heterogeneous structure involving contacts.@xcite we regard this behavior as compelling evidence for the electronic structure of the nanotubes being mostly responsible for the conductivity enhancement upon doping , with contact effects playing a secondary role .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by miyata et al.@xcite who explained the selective conductivity enhancement by the differences in the electronic density of states of metallic and semiconducting tubes and their change upon doping .",
    "hole doping results in an increased carrier ( hole ) density and partially filled valence bands , leading to enhanced intrinsic conductivity of the nanotubes .",
    "the carrier density changes show up in the optical spectra,@xcite with the free carrier absorption increasing and the interband transition intensities decreasing because of a decrease in the density of initial states for these transitions .",
    ".[tab : cond]conductivity data for metallic , semiconducting and reference films of different thicknesses . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     conductivity data are summarized in table [ tab : cond ] .",
    "these data show that the highest relative increase ( 12.8 - 17.5 ) is observed for the semiconducting sample , followed by the reference ( 7 - 10.9 ) while the lowest increase is shown by the metallic tubes ( 1.5 - 2.2 ) .",
    "( the thickness dependence of the conductivity enhancement is related to the percolation nature of conductance in the films.@xcite ) in absolute values , the doped reference sample gives the highest sheet conductivity .",
    "miyata et al.@xcite performed sulfuric acid doping on laser ablated metallic and reference nanotube samples .",
    "they obtain a sheet conductance enhancement of 1.58 for their metallic and 19.8 for the reference sample . comparing those with our numbers above and taking into account the difference in both starting material and doping agent",
    ", we find the agreement remarkable .",
    "studies on individual nanotube networks cited above@xcite resulted in the observation that the resistivity of junctions between semiconducting and metallic nanotubes - which create schottky barriers - is two orders of magnitude higher than the resistivity between tubes of the same electronic type . applying this model to our measurements ,",
    "two observations should follow if intertube contacts played the key role in network conductivity : 1 . in the undoped samples , both s and m type networks should have a higher dc conductivity than r , while at higher frequencies , the conductivity should scale with the metallic content ; and 2 .",
    "doping of a system where both metallic and semiconducting tubes occur , will result in dramatic decrease of intertube resistivity and consequent increase in dc conductivity . if intertube connections dominated during doping,@xcite the effect for the reference sample would be much larger in the transport than in the optical data . since our observations point to rather the opposite , we conclude that although intertube connections are important , they do not dominate transport properties of high - quality nanotube networks as these .",
    "a pure mechanical explanation for the conductivity enhancement upon acid treatment has also been suggested:@xcite according to this model , the only role the acidic dopant plays is to `` clean '' the intertube contacts from surfactant molecules present in the undoped sample .",
    "the presence of surfactant in the material has been , unfortunately , never proven , nor has any reaction been proposed between surfactant and acid . in our wide - range spectra , the intense infrared absorption of these organic molecules should be observed if they were present in significant concentration .",
    "also , our films are washed copiously with water after filtering and we believe that this treatment removes surfactants much more effectively and with much less residue than any unspecified reaction with an acid .",
    "dc sheet conductance s@xmath13 vs optical density ( -log t ) at 550 nm for the metallic , semiconducting and mixed reference swnt thin films after annealing and doping , respectively .",
    "the shaded area represents the application region of ito.,width=302 ]    for comparison of the transparent nanotube networks , we applied a recently introduced figure of merit,@xcite which is the inverse of that given by jain and kulshreshtha.@xcite this value is analogous to that defined by gordon@xcite but contains the transmission at a single wavelength instead of the integrated visible transmission , and similar to @xmath14 in ref . . fig .",
    "[ fig : cond1 ] shows the dc sheet conductance s@xmath13 as a function of optical density ( _ -log t _ ) at 550 nm , the wavelength of choice for solar cell applications . due to the fact that both the optical density and sheet conductivity are proportional to the thickness of the film , for each sample the measured values",
    "can be fitted with a linear function and the determination of the thickness is not necessary .",
    "higher slope of this line indicates better quality of the film as a transparent conductor .",
    "the shaded area represents the region of ito layers already used in technological applications ( sheet resistance r@xmath15 140 @xmath16 , @xmath17 0.7).@xcite extrapolating the values to lower thickness ( dashed lines in fig . [",
    "fig : cond1 ] ) indicates that both the doped reference sample and the doped semiconducting sample reach the minimum parameters of the ito region , while the doped metallic one barely misses it .",
    "figure [ fig : cond1 ] shows that doping causes the conductivity to increase in all samples , but the relative increase is different depending on electronic structure . at the chosen wavelength of 550 nm , the increase in slope of the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond1 ] , therefore the increased performance as transparent conductor , is determined by the change in conductivity rather than absorbance . from the optical density values in fig . [",
    "fig : cond1 ] , a change within 15 per cent in absorbance can be deduced . in the near infrared",
    ", however , the transmittivity of the samples with substantial semiconductor content rises dramatically ( fig . [",
    "fig : trans ] ) .",
    "this means that for near - infrared applications , carbon nanotubes would be even more hopeful than for visible ones .",
    "time dependence of the sheet conductivity of metallic , semiconducting and reference samples after doping with nitric acid .",
    "data have been scaled to the sheet conductivity value at 60 minutes after removal from nitric acid vapor .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the sheet conductivity of the undoped films .",
    "the samples numbered a , b and c , respectively , increase in thickness in that order.,width=302 ]    the most common practical problem with gas - phase doping is its reversibility , i.e. the dedoping process which usually starts as soon as the doping agent is removed .",
    "indirectly , this effect is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] where the error bars in the dc conductivity of the doped samples are significantly larger than those for the undoped samples .",
    "we have followed the dedoping process by measuring the sheet conductance for 24 hours after removing the samples from the nitric acid vapor .",
    "figure [ fig : tdep ] shows these curves for a set of nine samples similar to those in fig . [ fig : cond1 ] .",
    "the values before doping ( relative to the as - doped state ) are shown as dashed lines on each plot .",
    "all three types of samples show a behavior tending towards saturation which can be described by the sum of two exponential functions of time , but the parameters do not seem to have real physical significance and therefore we do not discuss them here .",
    "the most striking feature of fig . [ fig : tdep ] is that contrary to the semiconducting and mixed samples , which approach a much higher saturation conductivity than before doping , the metallic samples seem to return to their original conductance in about a day .",
    "doping is thus not very effective for these materials , but on the other hand , they seem to be the most stable against accidental doping .",
    "conclusions from our experiments can be drawn on two levels .",
    "first , frequency - dependent conductivity data indicate that by acid doping , the intrinsic conductivity increases considerably , especially for semiconducting nanotubes .",
    "although contacts play a crucial part in increasing conductivity of the networks , they are not the exclusive reason for improved electrical properties ; moreover , doping does not seem to improve contact resistance to an extent to be considered solely responsible for this effect .    the other type of conclusion concerns the application possibilities of separated and doped nanotube networks , respectively .",
    "if one chooses charge doping to increase the dc conductivity of carbon nanotubes , separation by type does not improve the results .",
    "doped non - separated nanotubes can be best applied to substitute ito for technological applications using visible light .",
    "however , undoped nanotubes of metallic type show other advantages : they have better conductance properties than either semiconducting or mixed ones , moreover , when doped , they recover their initial conductivity within less than 24 hours and are therefore much more stable against incidental doping , as already stated in ref . .",
