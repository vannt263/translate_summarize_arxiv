    "recent bethe ansatz studies of the one - dimensional hubbard model with open boundaries subject to boundary chemical potentials or magnetic fields @xcite have opened new possibilities to apply the predictions of boundary conformal field theory @xcite for the asymptotics of correlation functions to quantum impurity problems . as in the case of periodic systems , @xcite the corresponding matrix elements can not be computed directly but must be extracted from the scaling behaviour of the low  lying excited states . for generic filling and magnetization",
    "these finite size spectra allow the identification of the contributions from two massless bosonic sectors associated with the spin and charge excitations in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "a crucial step in these studies of systems with open boundary conditions is the correct interpretation of the finite - size spectra obtained from the bethe ansatz .",
    "these spectra determine both the bulk correlation functions , which are independent of the boundary fields , and the nonuniversal dependence of boundary phenomena such as the orthogonality exponent or x - ray edge singularities on the strength of the scatterer .",
    "hence both in the requirement of conformal invariance and in the analysis of the finite - size spectra , the computation of correlation functions relies on assumptions which need to be verified by a more direct method , most notably by numerical calculations . of course , comparison with exact results is also of interest for the numerical calculation : predictions of critical exponents for microscopic models allow the algorithms to be improved , which can then , in turn , be expected to produce better and more reliable results for more general systems .",
    "these considerations motivate our study of the friedel oscillations for the single particle density and magnetization in the open hubbard chain with boundary chemical potentials , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where the lattice has @xmath2 sites , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron on site @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and we have made the hopping integral dimensionless so that the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 and the on  site potential @xmath8 are measured in dimensionless units .",
    "numerical calculations of critical exponents in low dimensional systems such as magnetic chains or electronic systems have a long history * ? ? ?",
    "due to the need to consider systems of sufficient size , many earlier studies have used quantum monte carlo methods to treat systems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "@xcite more recently , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite has become a new and powerful method especially suited to the study of one dimensional systems with open boundary conditions ( obc ) .",
    "@xcite however systems with pbc have also been studied with this method .",

    "open boundaries are also the most favourable type of boundary conditions numerically : for a given number of states kept ( which corresponds to the amount of computer time needed ) the accuracy in calculated quantitites such as the ground state energy is , in general , orders of magnitude better for open boundary conditions than for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite    in this work the _ finite system _ dmrg method is used : after the system is built up to a given size using a variation of the _ infinite system _ method , a number of finite - system iterations are performed in which the overall size of the system ( i.e.  the superblock ) is kept fixed , but part of the system ( the system block ) is built up .",

    "previously , several methods have been used to obtain asymptotic exponents of correlation functions using numerical data.@xcite all of these methods use the @xmath2dependence of the fourier - transformed correlation functions near the relevant peaks @xmath106 @xmath107 in fourier space to extract the exponents .",
    "due to the fact that only systems with periodic boundary conditions were considered , the @xmath106 were all independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2-independence seems to be crucial for these methods to work ; we were not able to extract a reasonable exponent with any of these methods on a system with open boundary conditions .",

    "requires the use of large system sizes . while the numerical expense for the dmrg procedure grows linearly with the system size for a fixed number of states kept , the accuracy in the energy and in the local density and magnetization decreases with the system size , especially in the luttinger liquid regime .",

    "the amplitude @xmath147 for the summed momenta , which could not be determined for @xmath85 , increases monotonically with @xmath7 , and its @xmath167 extrapolation agrees well with the value for noninteracting fermions , @xmath169 .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections to the momenta @xmath122 fitted for the density and the magnetization , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom70 ] , are in good agreement with the bethe ansatz conjecture .",
    "the agreement is also fairly good for @xmath170 , although the error of the fit is rather large for small @xmath7 .",
    "however , the @xmath171 fit results do not match well with the conjecture . as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftne70](b ) , the @xmath109 and @xmath122 peaks in @xmath10 have much lower amplitudes than the @xmath121 peak , leading to lower accuracy in the fitting procedure .",
    "the fit results    for the exponents , fig .",
    "[ fig : exp70](b ) also had a rather large deviation from the cft results in this regime .",
    "thus it is not possible to confirm or deny the conjecture concerning the shift of @xmath121 for @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath109 the situation is even worse .",
    "both density and magnetization fits lead to large fit errors for @xmath149 .",
    "the deviation from the bethe ansatz conjectures is about @xmath172 in both fits , outside the range of the @xmath0 correction to @xmath173 .    in summary , for @xmath142 the dmrg results for the mean density ( magnetization , respectively ) and the exponents are in good agreement with exact results from ba / cft , further confirming conformal field theory .",
    "a detailed examination of the convergence of the dmrg shows that the numerical accuracy is actually slightly worse than the @xmath85 case , but this could be improved by increasing the number of states kept in the dmrg .",
    "we therefore expect to be able to apply these techniques reliably to obtain the boundary exponents and coeffients of other , non - bethe - ansatz solvable one - dimensional models .",
    "we now examine the effect of the boundary potential @xmath8 on the bethe ansatz predictions .",
    "we set @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath174 and consider six @xmath8 values , for which four qualitatively different bethe ansatz solutions exist . for @xmath175 ,",
    "no bound state is present in the bethe ansatz ground state ; we examine both repulsive and attractive fields .",
    "the values @xmath176 and @xmath177 are in a region in which the bethe ansatz has two complex @xmath40 solutions , one for each boundary potential at site @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the @xmath177 ground state configuration contains , in addition , two complex @xmath180 solutions .",
    "finally , for @xmath114 there are four complex @xmath40 and two complex @xmath180 solutions , corresponding to a bound pair of electrons at each end of the chain .",
    "details of the structure of the ground state as a function of @xmath8 are given in ref .   .",
    "the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath181 and @xmath182 at @xmath174 is not as strong as the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath119 and @xmath128 found previously .",
    "since we have chosen a fairly large @xmath7 , the peaks in the density @xmath9 have enough weight to fit all three momenta .",
    "as was the case for @xmath89 , the peak at @xmath109 in the magnetization is not pronounced enough to be fitted at any @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections to the mean values of the density and magnetization , fig .",
    "[ fig : meanp55 ] , are again in very good agreement with the bethe ansatz conjectures , showing that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nmc ] ) and ( [ eq : kc ] ) are valid even in the different physical regions described above . within the ba / cft calculations , the values of the exponents are independent of the boundary potentials",
    "@xmath8 . this agrees with the dmrg results , which we do not show here : the range of the exponents varies by at most 2% from the exact values for @xmath89 ( after a larger number of lattice points are discarded from the fits in order to avoid the bound states at the ends ) .    the amplitudes also have no significant @xmath8-dependence .",
    "the density fit yields @xmath183 and @xmath184 ,    while the magnetization fit yields @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the absence of @xmath8-dependence at @xmath174 suggests that the interaction dependence of the coefficients should be that of fig .",
    "[ fig : koeff55 ] , independent of the boundary fields @xmath8 .",
    "the effect of the boundary potential @xmath8 on the shift of the positions of the peaks is much larger than the effect of varying @xmath7 ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : mom55p ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : mom55 ] ) .",
    "since the fit results for all three @xmath40 values agree very well with the bethe ansatz conjectures , the confirmation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kc ] ) is even more compelling than it was for the @xmath7dependence .",
    "we have carried out a detailed comparison between the exact bethe ansatz solution and density matrix renormalization group calculations for the one - dimensional hubbard model with open boundary conditions both with and without an additional chemical potential at both ends .",
    "a direct comparison of the ground state energies as well as the density and magnetization at the ends of the chain has allowed us to estimate the accuracy of the dmrg on the large system sizes used in this work .",
    "we have then compared the behaviour of the friedel oscillations in the local density and local magnetization calculated directly using the dmrg with conformal field theory predictions for the asymptotic forms for which the exponents can be calculated using the bethe ansatz .",
    "we have performed this check for two different fillings , @xmath187 and @xmath188 for the case without boundary potentials , @xmath189 .",
    "we have obtained results consistent with the cft predictions in all cases except those in which it is clear that the accuracy of the fitting procedure breaks down .",
    "such a breakdown occurs when a particular peak in the fourier transform of the density or magnetization becomes lightly weighted and thus poorly defined .",
    "this occurs principally for the @xmath190 peak , especially at small @xmath7 values .",
    "the good agreement between the cft forms and ba values of the exponents and the dmrg calculations provides both a confirmation of the cft predictions and a way to test the accuracy of the dmrg and of the effectiveness of fitting procedures for the friedel oscillations .",
    "in addition , we have proposed a relation between the @xmath0 corrected mean values in the density and magnetization and the @xmath0 corrections occuring in the bae .",
    "this conjecture is supported by good agreement between mean values obtained from the fit to the dmrg data and the bae results .",
    "we have been able to extract for the first time the interaction dependence of the amplitudes for the friedel oscillations , a property not possible to calculate in the framework of the cft , and have found the correct behaviour in the @xmath115 limit .",
    "finally , we have turned on boundary chemical potentials at @xmath85 and examined the @xmath8-dependence of the critical exponents , the amplitudes and our conjectures for the behaviour of the mean density and magnetization .",
    "the different @xmath8-regimes that we have considered yield qualitatively distinct bethe ansatz solutions that are physically connected with the formation of different types of bound states at the system boundaries . in agreement with ba / cft predictions , we have found that the critical exponents are independent of @xmath8 and that the influence of @xmath8 on the amplitudes is very weak .",
    "we have also found that our conjectures for the @xmath0 corrected mean values of the density , magnetization and the wave - vector hold in all of the physically different @xmath8-regimes .",
    "the combination of analytical and numerical methods presented here has yielded new insights into both .",
    "the success of the numerical techniques will now allow the examination of more complicated systems that are not exactly solvable . through comparison with the dmrg calculations ,",
    "we have also been able to show that more information is contained in the bae than is obtained from a direct interpretation via conformal field theory .",
