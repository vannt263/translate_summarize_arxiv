    "this dataset is therefore in contrast to that presented in @xcite , in which long- and short - wavelength spectral maps are used to analyze n66 .",
    "while they analyzed full spectral maps of the entire region , the data we present here is deeper and allows us to study the faint extended emission around the point sources at a level of detail that the full maps did not allow .",

    "two point sources have been extracted using two different methods as an example .",

    "for example , the [ s iv ]  10.51  emission line , which is often prominent in hii regions , is not associated with the point source spectra ; the reason it appears in the column extraction is because it is nebular emission along the line - of - sight to the point source .",
    "in fact , we would get the wrong diagnostic with a variable column extraction , since the nebular [ siv ] would be erroneously assigned to the point source .",
    "the [ neii ]  12.81  emission line is also nebular in nature for the massive embedded yso ( left - hand plot ) .",
    "in addition to the nebular forbidden atomic lines , a certain amount of the dust continuum is also missing from the optimally extracted spectra , meaning that it is also nebular in nature . by separating out the point source from the line - of - sight nebular emission , we have separate views of emission that is associated with the unresolved point sources in n66 and emission that originates in the diffuse h ii region and pdr .    ]",
    "10.51  emission , a portion of the [ ne ii ]  12.81  emission , and some dust continuum emission is not associated with these point source spectra , but is nebular in nature .",
    "this nebular emission is shown in the `` difference '' spectra in the bottom panels.[optext_comp ] ]    optimal extraction of all of the pointings was performed , producing point source and extended emission spectra from the full slit length for each pointing .",
    "two of the re - observed pointings have extended emission spectra that were dominated by noise and are not used in the analysis .",
    "observations where the point source lies partially outside of the slit in the dispersion direction were extracted with a special tool developed for and included in smart - adopt . applying the centered psf template to an observation with incorrect",
    "pointing makes the spectral shape incorrect , but accounting for the pointing error allows a properly - shaped psf to be fit to the point source so that regular optimal extraction and accurate flux calibration can be done . for details on the source extraction for sources offset in the dispersion direction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the reduced spectra are shown in appendix 1 at the end of this paper .",
    "typical mid - infrared spectra of hii regions and their surrounding pdrs have the following features : a dust continuum , several prominent pah features , molecular hydrogen emission lines , atomic and ionic emission lines , and absorption or emission features due to small silicaceous grains centered at 9.8  and 17  . in order to study the dust and gas diagnostics in n66 , all of the spectra were decomposed into these components .",
    "we used the specral decomposition tool pahfit @xcite .",
    "pahfit models the dust continuum that underlies the pah features with as many as eight blackbody continua at fixed temperatures less than 300  k , fits the silicate absorption features at 9.8  and 17  , and models the pah features with asymmetric drude profiles . in order to fit the spectra for n66 with pahfit",
    ", a couple of small changes were made . in some cases , the input full - width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of the 6.2  and 11.3  features needed to be changed in order to fit the features more precisely ( see   [ pahprofiles ] below for a discussion about the 11.3  pah feature profiles ) .",
    "second , for sources that exhibit a silicate emission feature , two additional drude profiles were added to model the 9.8  silicate emission feature : these drude profiles , centered at 9.2  and 10.0  , have fwhm of 0.3  and 0.2  respectively . for spectra with silicate emission features included , pahfit did _ not _ also fit silicate absorption features . due to the presence of hydrogen recombination lines in some of the spectra",
    ", we include the hi  6 - 5 7.46  line to pahfit s line list .",
    "example point source and extended emission pahfit fits are shown in the top panels of figure  [ decompcomp ] , where the plotting scheme is explained in the caption .",
    "one major difference in the fits between the point source and extended emission spectra is that the silicate absorption feature is only fit to those point source spectra that do not explicitly require a silicate emission feature , and none of the extended emission features exhibit silicate absorption in the final fits .",
    "there is some concern that pah fitting routines like pahfit may be introducing errors inadvertently into the pah fluxes .",
    "when applying pahfit , the underlying pah `` plateaux '' are incorporated into the wings of the drude profiles used to fit the pah bands , in particular for the 7.7  band .",
    "peeters et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) has found that the spatial morphology of the plateau is quite distinct from that of the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6  pah bands in data of the reflection nebula ngc  2023 . to see",
    "if the pah plateaux in the n66 spectra is also decoupled from the pah features , we have fit a spline to the underlying continuum and measured the pah features above the continuum , as in @xcite .",
    "we have determined that , although the exact values for the pah band fluxes differ depending on the decomposition method used , the trends discussed in detail in   [ pahratios ] hold regardless .",
    "the spectral decomposition method illustrated in figure  [ decompcomp ] is a reliable method for comparing pah band fluxes .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    due to concerns about error propagation from extraction to decomposition , the errors of the pah feature strengths were determined with a monte carlo method .",
    "the root mean square error in the continuum near 6  was measured for each spectrum and then used to randomly perturb the spectrum .",
    "6  was chosen because the noise is systematically higher at the shortest wavelengths in the sl spectrum , due to the lower signal in these sources at this wavelength .",
    "the noise is , on average , two times greater at 6  than it is at 14  , measured as the standard deviation of the root mean square of the difference of the unperturbed spectrum and the best fit pahfit model .",
    "the spectrum , including the random noise , was then fit with pahfit and the resultant strengths of the pah features were recorded .",
    "this was done 300 times , after which the standard deviation of the pah feature strength measurements was taken as the statistical error in the 300 fitted feature strengths .",
    "while pahfit also fits any number of user - requested atomic , ionic , and molecular features in addition to the dust continuum and pah features , we fit the narrow lines manually with the idea tool in smart .",
    "the reason for this additional step is that pahfit functions first and foremost as a fitting tool , and will therefore include all of the parameters it is given into the final solution .",
    "this means that in the point source spectra , for instance , pahfit will generally give the [ siv ]  10.51  line a flux even when it is clear from a visual inspection that this line is not detected .",
    "therefore , in order to systematically determine narrow line fluxes and upper limits , we chose to use a manual tool for line fits .",
    "we used a first - order local continuum subtraction to estimate continuum flux beneath the narrow features .",
    "the [ neii ]  12.81  feature is blended with a pah feature and the line flux may therefore contain some pah emission ; due to the presence of pahs in all spectra , we believe that any offset due to this contamination is largely systematic but may contribute substantially to the point source spectra ps12 , ps13 , and ps14 , which exhibit much lower [ neii ] fluxes than the other spectra .",
    "the continuum at 13.7 - 14.2  contains two prominent pah features that , when compared to the pahfit dust continuum and pah feature fits , systematically contributed roughly twenty per - cent to the continuum at these wavelengths ; the continuum was therefore measured as the average in the pahfit dust continuum beneath the pah features .",
    "the final atomic , ionic , pah , and continuum measurements along with their errors are given in tables  [ lines ] & [ pahs ] .",
    "we carried out a literature search in order to identify known objects associated with the infrared point source centroids .",
    "table  [ targets ] lists the targeted point sources from this study , corresponding labels from @xcite and @xcite , and additional information from the literature .",
    "all point sources are identified as sites of recent or ongoing star formation , and are typically young protostars or young stellar clusters . a number of the point sources exhibit interesting spectral features that are worth a closer look .",
    "we describe these point sources in detail below .",
    "unresolved emission from two bright star clusters in n66 exhibit silicate emission features in their spectra : ngc  346 ( ps9 ) and n66b ( ps6 ) ; see figure  [ starclusters ] .",
    "both of these point sources are bright h@xmath9  sources @xcite , contain ` blue ' stars @xcite , and have been modeled as @xmath0  3  myr old with _ hubble _ color - magnitude diagrams @xcite .",

    "both show pronounced silicate emission features . [ starclusters ] ]    the origin of the silicate emission is most likely an optically thin layer of intracluster and/or enveloping dust that has been heated to @xmath0  200  k by the stars in the central clusters .",

    "hubble _ data presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the stars in the centers of the clusters are clearly visible through the intervening dust , and supported by the measured extinction by dust @xcite .",
    "this geometry is similar to clumpy model geometries for young star clusters presented in @xcite , where silicate emission / absorption was found to be dependent on the line - of - sight dust geometry .",
    "neither cluster is resolved in the spectral slit , and we therefore did not employ the irs ll module ( 15 @xmath19 @xmath11 @xmath19 37 ) to measure the 17  silicate emission as in @xcite and @xcite because the flux mis - match between the sl and ll _ spitzer_/irs modules is very substantial and would bias the silicate dust temperature measurement .",
    "the presence of an o5.5v star in n66b and an o9v star in ngc  346 means that the point source extractions show a little [ s iv ] emission in n66b , none in ngc  346 , and [ neii ] emission in both .",

    "it is not likely that this line is due to improperly calibrated pixels on the array , but is an actual astronomical feature . in order to determine whether the narrow line at 11.3  is the hi  9 - 7 line",

    "this might suggest that the pah emission from the embedding envelope is either more heavily ionized than other point sources , or else the average pah size is smaller . having a population of ionized pahs in the yso environment seems unlikely because the temperature of a class i yso is probably very low ( @xmath0250 k ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hii regions n66b and n66c ( ps5 & ps6 ) both lie near the average value for i@xmath2/i@xmath3 , but ngc  346 ( ps9 ) lies well off of this average , with an outlying value of @xmath0  0.03 . the low value for the 7.7  feature strength in ngc  346 is confirmed with a visual inspection of the spectrum - see the appendix , figure  [ spec2 ] . as an opposite example to the yso , ngc  346 may either contain a largely neutral pah population or else very large pahs ; the latter solution seems most sensible given the numerous blue stars in the cluster .",
    "the lack of correlation seen in figure  [ galliano1 ] is intriguing because the 6.2  and 7.7  pah features are generally very tightly correlated for spectra of hii regions and entire galaxies @xcite , for planetary nebulae @xcite , and in the reflection nebula ngc  2023 ( peeters et al .",

    "what our analysis is able to show is that the point sources lie in a similar pah ratio space to the extended emission , despite the different physical conditions as discussed .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the pah population exists on a spectrum , from more neutral in the dense pdr where the point sources lie , to more ionized in the diffuse pdr and hii region .",
    "the pah population size distribution in low - metallicity environments is a contentious topic . in a study of low - metallicity bcds",

    "the analysis of the i@xmath45/i@xmath3 pah ratio by @xcite suggests the opposite , that low - metallicity environments ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath46 8.1 ) host pah populations with small sizes on average .",
    "we do not have the long - wavelength data to sufficient depth or spatial resolution for a i@xmath45/i@xmath3 analysis ; however , that data is available in the @xcite maps , and they determine that the n@xmath47 value is smaller in the smc than in the milky way based on the weak 17.0  pah feature .",

    "there is a source of bias in this comparison worth noting .",

    "each spectrum likely contains emission from both star - forming and quiescent regions .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the results for n66 are both separated and qualitatively different from those of the other regions .",
    "the smc ( including n66 ) is the closest low - metallicity star forming galaxy to the milky way and can therefore be used to study possible trends to other low - metallicity star - forming environments .",
    "it is therefore important to determine what the dominant source of the pah emission in n66 is , in order to properly interpret unresolved h ii region studies .",
    "does the pah emission primarily come from the high s / n point sources , or from the diffuse ism in the hii region and pdr ?    using the spectral maps of n66 presented in @xcite in order to study a spatially well - sampled dataset , we made maps of the 6.2  and 11.3  pah features by subtracting away the continuum measured locally .",
    "the 7.7  feature straddles the sl1 and sl2 orders and the 8.6  feature is very hard to pick out from the continuum , so these two features were excluded from the analysis .",

    "we find that the fraction of the pah emission coming from the point sources is 28  @xmath51  8% for the 6.2  pah feature and 21  @xmath51  6% for the 11.3  pah feature .",
    "due to the relatively high level of variance between these two pah features , we conclude that , as a rough proxy for studies of unresolved star formation at low - metallicity , the point sources ( resolved down to @xmath0  2 pc ) contribute roughly @xmath0  20 - 35% of the pah emission across the region .",
    "this means that it is the extended emission which dominates the observed pah brightness in n66 , and possibly low - metallicity giant hii regions generally .",
    "n66 is the largest starburst in the smc and contains half of the entire galaxy s o  stars .",
    "its hard radiation field and low metallicity make it an excellent corollary to studies of bcds and high - redshift starbursts .",
    "our analysis of _ spitzer / irs _ spectra from 5 - 14  makes use of powerful optimal extraction routines that separate emission from the dense pdr s unresolved point sources and the surrounding ism s more diffuse emission .",

    "of special note are the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive embedded class  i yso , the detection of silicates associated with young ( @xmath0  3  myr ) stellar clusters , and the detection of pahs and silicates associated with a b[e ] star that indicates it may in fact be a herbig aebe star . in the diffuse ism",
    ", we find evidence that the very small grains are being photodestroyed , consistent with previous studies of n66 .",
    "the pah emission shows several interesting features .",
    "the 11.3  pah complex has an unexplained centroid shift for both point sources and the diffuse ism . in general , the pahs are best classified as type a. however , a slight widening of the 7.7  feature in some of the spectra is either due to the 7.46  hi 6 - 5 line in the diffuse emission spectra , or else the removal of ism contamination that reveals type b - like circumstellar features .",
    "the 6.2  and 7.7  pah band fluxes in n66 do not correlate with each other , an observation that we do not believe has been observed in other objects . because we were able to separate out the point source and extended emission in the spectral slit , the conclusions we draw from the pah ratios are detailed where those presented in @xcite are more general",
    ": we find that the pahs are more neutral in the densest parts of the pdr ( including the entire point source catalogue ) , and more ionized in the diffuse ism while @xcite determined that the pahs were on average more neutral than in higher - metallicity galaxies . on average ,",
    "@xcite found that pahs in the smc are smaller compared to those in more metal rich galaxies .",
    "we show that on small scales , the size distribution of the pahs in n66 ( based on the 8.6  pah feature flux ) does not appear to be correlated with their ionization state and is therefore independent of the ratio of uv field strength to electron density .",
    "we stress that , on average , our results match the work of @xcite extremely well , and that the spread in ionization state and lack of clear trend with minimum pah size on small scales is made possible by our spectral extraction techniques .",
    "lastly , we have determined using spectral maps of the region that only @xmath0  20 - 35 % of the pah emission in n66 is coming from the unresolved point sources , and it is therefore dominated by the diffuse emission .",
    "this percentage suggests that studies of unresolved low - metallicity star - forming regions in nearby bcds and starburst galaxies will also have pah spectra dominated by the diffuse hii region and pdr , not the unresolved point sources , and the observed pah signatures of the point source spectra are therefore not representative of the entire hii region s properties .",

    "<S> the focus of this work is to study mid - infrared point sources and the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) in the low - metallicity ( @xmath0  0.2  z@xmath1 ) giant hii region n66 in order to determine properties that may shed light on star formation in these conditions . using the _ spitzer space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> s infrared spectrograph , we study polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) , dust continuum , silicate , and ionic line emission from 14 targeted infrared point sources as well as spectra of the diffuse ism that is representative of both the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) and the hii regions . among the point source spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we spectroscopically confirm that the brightest mid - infrared point source is a massive embedded young stellar object , we detect silicates in emission associated with two young stellar clusters , and we observe spectral features of a known b[e ] supergiant that are more commonly associated with herbig be stars . in the diffuse ism , we provide additional evidence that the very small grain population is being photodestroyed in the hard radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the 11.3  pah complex emission exhibits an unexplained centroid shift in both the point source and ism spectra that should be investigated at higher signal - to - noise and resolution . unlike studies of other regions , the 6.2  and 7.7  band fluxes are decoupled ; the data points cover a large range of i@xmath2/i@xmath3 pah ratio values within a narrow band of i@xmath4/i@xmath3 ratio values . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is a spread in pah ionization , being more neutral in the dense pdr where the radiation field is relatively soft , but ionized in the diffuse ism / pdr . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the pah size distribution appears to be independent of local ionization state . </S>",
    "<S> important to unresolved studies of extragalactic low - metallicity star - forming regions , we find that emission from the infrared - bright point sources accounts for only 20 - 35% of the pah emission from the entire region . </S>",
    "<S> these results make a comparative dataset to other star - forming regions with similarly hard and strong radiation fields . </S>"
