    "a large number of measurements on the structure of different hadronic objects has been performed in the past decades and elaborate descriptions of them have been developed in terms of parton distribution functions .",
    "frequently , the many data points and multiple parameter descriptions make reading of physics messages from the data not obvious .",
    "this contribution attempts an intuitive description of structure functions which has a relation to qcd predictions and is applied to structure function measurements of the proton , the photon , and colour singlet exchange .",
    "the qcd evolution equations predict that measurements of hadronic structures depend on the logarithm of the resolution scale @xmath0 at which the structure is probed . on this basis ,",
    "the following ansatz to analyse the @xmath1-dependence of structure function data is explored , where @xmath1 denotes the bjorken fractional momentum of the scattered parton relative to the hadronic object : @xmath2^{\\;\\ ; \\kappa(x ) } \\ ; . \\label{eq : f2}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is a scale parameter , @xmath4 reflects the charge squared weighted quark distributions extrapolated to @xmath5 , and @xmath6 determines the positive and negative scaling violations of @xmath7 .    in fig.[fig",

    "the result of a two - parameter fit according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2 ] ) is shown , using a fixed value of @xmath10 gev which represents a typical value of the strong interaction scale .",
    "only the total experimental errors have been used , ignoring correlations between individual data points .",
    "the same fitting procedure has been applied to bcdms data @xcite which are taken here as a reference sample for the high-@xmath1 region ( fig.[fig : proton - bcdms ] ) ( after finalising this analysis the author s attention was called to a study fitting the bcdms data to a similar expression @xcite ) .",
    "all data turn out to be well described ( @xmath11ndf : @xmath12 h1 , @xmath13 zeus , @xmath14 bcdms ) .",
    "the resulting parameters @xmath4 and @xmath6 are summarized in fig.[fig : akappa ] as a function of @xmath1 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the data fits exhibit two distinct regions : around @xmath15 they reflect the valence quark distributions . at low @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath16 is compatible with converging to a constant value .",
    "the resulting scaling violation term @xmath6 appears to rise as @xmath1 decreases , exhibiting the negative and positive scaling violations of @xmath7 for @xmath1 above and below @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the errors in fig.[fig : akappa ] represent the statistical errors of the fits .",
    "both parameters @xmath4 and @xmath6 are anti - correlated as can be seen from neighbouring points .",
    "no significant @xmath0-dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath6 has been found when the fits were repeated for two intervals in @xmath0 ( above and below @xmath18 gev@xmath9 ) .    with @xmath4 being approximately constant below @xmath19 , changes of @xmath7 at low @xmath1 result from the scaling violation term @xmath6 alone , indicative of the interaction dynamics that drives @xmath7 and in support of @xcite .    for comparison ,",
    "the same fits have been applied to recent measurements of the photon structure function @xmath20 which have been performed at @xmath21 colliders @xcite ( fig.[fig : fluct]a , @xmath11ndf : @xmath22 ) .",
    "the photon structure results from fluctuations of a photon into a colour neutral and flavour neutral hadronic state .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath6 are shown in fig.[fig : akappa ] as the open circles . the photon data exhibit positive scaling violations at all @xmath1 that are distinct from those of a hadronic bound state like the proton .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is approximately @xmath23 .",
    "this is as expected from qcd calculations which predict @xmath20 for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the low-@xmath1 region around @xmath25 the photon data prefer similar values of @xmath4 to the low-@xmath1 proton data .    in fig.[fig :",
    "fluct]b , h1 structure function measurements @xmath26 of colour singlet exchange @xcite are compared to the same two - parameter fits as used above ( @xmath11ndf : @xmath27 ) . here",
    "@xmath1 denotes the fractional momentum of the scattered parton relative to the colour neutral object , which itself carries a fractional momentum @xmath28 relative to the proton .",
    "also these data exhibit scaling violations @xmath6 that are different from the proton measurements at the same values of @xmath1 ( fig.[fig : akappa]b ) . instead ,",
    "at @xmath29 they are large and similar to the photon data and to the low-@xmath1 proton data .",
    "the large rate of events with colour singlet exchange together with the large scaling violations of @xmath26 is suggestive of a gluon dominated exchange .",
    "the values of the normalization @xmath4 increase with increasing @xmath1 to about @xmath30 as can be seen from extrapolating the curves in fig.[fig : fluct]b towards small @xmath0 .",
    "these values have large uncertainties of the order of @xmath31 and are not shown in fig.[fig : akappa]a .",
    "in the following only the proton data are considered .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 has already been identified as the charge squared weighted quark distributions extrapolated to @xmath5 .",
    "an understanding of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath6 can be achieved by comparison with the qcd evolution equation which is written here in the leading order dglap approximation : @xmath32 here @xmath33 denote the parton densities , @xmath34 are the splitting functions , and @xmath35 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the derivative of the ansatz chosen here , eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2 ] ) , with respect to @xmath36 gives @xmath37 where relating @xmath38 with @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dglap ] ) implies association of the scale parameter @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2 ] ) with the qcd parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the term @xmath6 relates with the sum over the different parton radiation terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dglap ] ) divided by @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 increases towards small @xmath1 , consistent with larger phase space available for parton radiation .    to match the description chosen here , eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2 ] ) , with the double asymptotic approximation expected from qcd for the gluon - dominated region at small @xmath1 , @xmath41 @xcite , the scaling violation term @xmath6 is required to have a dependence like + @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath6 is therefore expected to be very small which is in agreement with the experimental observation stated above .",
    "based on logarithmic @xmath0-dependence , the presented fits of structure function measurements in bins of @xmath1 give information on the hadronic structures and the parton dynamics .    published proton data , extrapolated to a low resolution scale @xmath0 ,",
    "show beyond the valence quarks a sea quark density which is compatible with a constant value .",
    "therefore , at small @xmath1 , the @xmath1- and @xmath0-dependencies of @xmath7 dominantly originate from the measured scaling violations which are directly related to the parton dynamics of the interaction .",
    "more precise data and data reaching smaller values of @xmath1 will determine whether or not the scaling violations further increase towards low-@xmath1 and therefore give valuable information on the parton densities in the proton as @xmath1 approaches @xmath43 .",
    "the large scaling violations observed in the structure function data of colour singlet exchange are suggestive of a gluon dominated exchange .",
    "more precise measurements will test whether at low @xmath0 one parton carries most of the momentum and will provide a reference for a gluon driven regime .    judgement on a universal low-@xmath1 behaviour of hadronic structures will result from measurements of the photon structure function . if the photon data show a constant quark density at small @xmath1 similar to the low-@xmath1 proton data , scaling violations of @xmath20 , which deviate from those resulting from the photon splitting into quark - antiquark pairs and approach those observed for the proton , could become visible in the regions around @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
