    "[ section : s1 ] let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-adic field . consider an power series @xmath7 with coefficients in @xmath0 and a nonzero disk @xmath8 of convergence at @xmath4 , with @xmath9 .",
    "these are @xmath0-analytic functions with a fixed point at @xmath4 , considered as invertible germs at @xmath4 .",
    "a basic problem is to determine when two such germs are conjugate by a germ @xmath5 under the operation of composition .",
    "there are several such problems , depending on what conditions we impose on @xmath5 .",
    "we may merely ask for @xmath5 to be homeomorphism , a rather weak condition , or insist on it being analytic , the strongest such condition .",
    "homeomorphic equivalence depends on the dynamic nature of @xmath10 , which is called the multiplier of @xmath2 .",
    "we consider four types of multipliers .",
    "we say that @xmath10 ( or @xmath2 ) is contracting if @xmath11 , expanding if @xmath12 , or indifferent if @xmath13 . in the last case ,",
    "if @xmath10 is a root of unity , then @xmath2 is called indifferent rational ; otherwise it is called indifferent irrational .",
    "the set of contracting ( resp .",
    "expanding ) maps is a homeomorphic equivalence class .",
    "the set of indifferent maps @xmath2 with no power of @xmath2 equal to the identity is a homeomorphic equivalence class .",
    "( we will encounter the proofs of most of these facts in this paper . )    as for analytic equivalence , the easiest case is when the multiplier of @xmath2 is not indifferent rational ; then @xmath2 is analytically equivalent to @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the indifferent rational case reduces to the case where the multiplier is @xmath15 .",
    "then , any such map is analytically equivalent to one of the form @xmath16 .",
    "( see @xcite , or @xcite for another approach . )",
    "the main object of this work is to study an intermediate equivalence relation between these two extremes , that of lipeomorphic equivalence .",
    "let @xmath5 be a homeomorphism .",
    "then @xmath5 is called a lipeomorphism if both @xmath5 and its inverse @xmath17 are lipschitz continuous .",
    "two germs @xmath2 and @xmath3 are called lipeomorphically equivalent if they may be intertwined by a lipeomorphic germ .",
    "in addition to the construction of lipeomorphic intertwining maps , a main goal of this paper is to show how imposing lipschitz or hlder continuity conditions on the intertwining maps @xmath5 leads to interesting new theory .",
    "as we will see , these conditions illuminate the dynamical local nature of the functions .",
    "our primary focus is on maps whose multiplier is @xmath15 .",
    "writing now @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the smallest integer so that @xmath20 ; we call @xmath19 the order of @xmath2 .",
    "this is an analytic invariant .",
    "our first result is that if the order of @xmath2 is equal to the order of @xmath3 , and the coefficients @xmath21 agree , then @xmath2 and @xmath3 are lipeomorphically equivalent .",
    "[ lipeomorphic conjugacy ] let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-adic field , and let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be analytic functions , with @xmath9 .",
    "then , @xmath2 is lipeomorphically equivalent to @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the conjugating map @xmath5 that we construct is an isometry .    in proving this theorem , we will employ the time-@xmath24 maps of certain vector fields @xmath25 .",
    "these flows are simple to iterate , and thus serve as a useful representative for the lipeomorphic equivalence class .",
    "they are obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath26 for example , the time-@xmath24 map of @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "we have the power - series expansion @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , it is easily shown that for any @xmath19 , we have the power series expansion @xmath30 .",
    "our proof follows much of the ideas of shcherbakov @xcite in the complex case .",
    "briefly , the idea is to transport the problem at @xmath4 to a problem at infinity by conjugating by an @xmath19th power map .",
    "let @xmath31 and write @xmath32 for the translation function @xmath33 .",
    "after this transportation , we are left showing that a function @xmath34 which is suitably close to @xmath32 is lipeomorphically equivalent to @xmath32 .",
    "write @xmath35 for the difference @xmath36 , a rapidly decaying function",
    ". the essential calculation of our proof is some light arithmetic , which yields @xmath1-adic estimates for sums of iterates of @xmath35 .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we constrain ourselves to @xmath37 , but expand our vision to comparing all the types of functions mentioned above to each other .",
    "for instance , if the orders of @xmath2 and @xmath3 differ , we find that no intertwining map @xmath5 can be a lipeomorphism .",
    "one can be found , however , which satisfies a hlder - type condition at @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , we find the best possible hlder exponents at @xmath4 in all cases .",
    "we prove the following theorem :    [ local holder continuity ] let @xmath38 , @xmath39 be @xmath37-analytic functions with @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath2 and @xmath3 are conjugate via a homeomorphism @xmath5 defined between neighborhoods @xmath41 and @xmath42 of @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath43 .",
    "then we may choose @xmath5 and a constant @xmath44 with the property that @xmath45 are in the same @xmath46-orbit , then @xmath47 are in the same @xmath46-orbit , then latexmath:[\\[\\label{sekund }     we arrive at this theorem by analyzing the closures in @xmath37 of the orbits of points close to @xmath4 , which we call `` @xmath46-orbits '' .",
    "the number of @xmath46-orbits of a given norm for @xmath2 and @xmath3 determine how rapidly @xmath5 needs to shrink or expand , and the result follows .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the two theorems cited above is the affinity with known results in the archimedean theory .",
    "we will discuss this more fully in the next section , but the guiding principle we have used here is that , after applying appropriate estimates , the non - archimedean theory closely mirrors its archimedean counterpart .",
    "this is quite surprising , particularly given the great differences between the topologies on the fields @xmath37 and that on @xmath49 .",
    "next , we answer these same questions for the multiplier maps @xmath50 in @xmath37 . as in the previous case ,",
    "a line is drawn quite naturally when we ask for the best hlder estimate at @xmath4 for the intertwining maps @xmath5 between different @xmath50 .",
    "between any two contracting multiplier maps , and between any two indifferent multiplier maps , we determine this largest exponent @xmath51 . for @xmath10",
    "indifferent , write @xmath52 for the number of @xmath46-orbits of @xmath50 of each radius . for indifferent multiplier maps ,",
    "we prove that @xmath50 and @xmath53 are lipeomorphically equivalent if and only if @xmath54 .",
    "indeed the best exponent @xmath51 is the ratio of these two numbers .",
    "we compute @xmath52 in corollary [ multorbs ] .",
    "moreover we show that a conjugating map from a flow @xmath55 to an indifferent irrational multiplier map can not satisfy _ any _ hlder estimate at @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a map @xmath56 with @xmath9 is not lipeomorphically linearizable .    as an example of",
    "how homeomorphic equivalence is not without merit , we consider functions @xmath57 defined on different @xmath1-adic spaces , for distinct prime numbers @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , they are _ never _ homeomorphically equivalent , even though the spaces themselves are homeomorphic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin with a short survey of known results in both the archimedean and non - archimedean categories in section [ section : s1.5 ] .",
    "section [ section : s2 ] is devoted to some preliminaries on the additive and multiplicative theory for a general @xmath1-adic field . in section [ section : s3 ]",
    "we define the time-@xmath10 maps of the vector fields @xmath58 within the fields @xmath37 , as well as some topological analysis of the structure of their orbits .",
    "section [ section : s4 ] proves the lipeomorphism result of theorem [ lipeomorphic conjugacy ] . in covering all @xmath1-adic fields , and all orders",
    ", it necessarily takes some effort .",
    "the reader will find many of the proofs much easier in the case where @xmath59 and when @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    ", the theory extends all the way to @xmath61 .",
    "we also show that the conjugating lipeomorphisms , which are defined on disks , even extend to the corresponding berkovich disk .",
    "the rest of the paper has a cosier flavor , as we focus on @xmath59 .",
    "it may be read independently of the earlier proofs .",
    "section [ section : s5 ] is used to describe a general theory of `` bullseye spaces '' , the kinds of topological spaces one gets from the set of orbits for our functions , as we take aim at behavior near @xmath4 .",
    "their theory is used to give a detailed analysis of pointwise estimates of conjugating homeomorphisms between maps defined locally on @xmath37 . within the section",
    "can be found the proof of theorem [ local holder continuity ] .    in section [ multipliers ]",
    "we find the best hlder constants for intertwining maps between multiplier maps , again using the theory of bullseye spaces .",
    "section [ section : s6 ] settles homeomorphic equivalence for functions defined on different @xmath1-adic spaces .",
    "finally , we include an appendix , giving a technical proof of a result which is needed for theorem [ lipeomorphic conjugacy ] .",
    "this project began while the authors were visiting purdue university .",
    "the research continued while the first author visited kansas state university and the second visited the university of oklahoma .",
    "the authors are thankful for the support of these departments .",
    "in addition , the authors would like to thank rob benedetto for a series of communications on the topics mentioned here , and in particular for suggesting the material in section [ notstolovitch ] .",
    "[ section : s1.5 ]    it is worth summarizing some of the salient points of the archimedean theory , for if the field @xmath0 was chosen instead to be @xmath62 or @xmath49 , this subject has been developed for many years by a variety of mathematicians .",
    "one of the first attempts at understanding the topological structure of a holomorphic ( i.e. analytic in @xmath49 ) mapping @xmath63 tangent to the identity and locally defined near @xmath64 was given by fatou @xcite in the late 1910s .",
    "while a topological conjugacy was not constructed on a full neighborhood of @xmath4 , fatou discovered that the orbits possessed a `` flower '' structure with a number of `` petals '' dependent only on the number @xmath19 . using this geometric argument",
    ", he was able to conclude that for @xmath65 , the number @xmath19 is a topological invariant .    however , it was not until the late 70 s that it was shown that @xmath19 is the _ only _ topological invariant .",
    "the following result , proven independently by camacho and shcherbakov , demonstates this :    * theorem ( camacho @xcite , shcherbakov @xcite)*. _ let @xmath66 , and suppose that @xmath67 is a function defined and holomorphic in a small neighborhood @xmath8 of the origin @xmath64 , with @xmath68 .",
    "then , there is a neighborhood @xmath69 and a homeomorphism @xmath5 defined in @xmath70 so that @xmath71_.    we will speak more on shcherbakov s version of this result in a moment .",
    "however , we note that a simple computation shows that the time-@xmath15 map @xmath72 of @xmath58 can be expanded as a power series centered at @xmath64 with only real ( indeed , only rational ) coefficients .",
    "thus , we can also view these mappings as real - analytic diffeomorphisms defined on an interval @xmath73 .",
    "however , the dynamics of these mappings as germs defined in @xmath74 are , predictably , much less interesting than their complex counterparts .",
    "we recall a simple argument that demonstrates this .",
    "* lemma*. _ fix @xmath75 with @xmath76 . for a sufficiently small @xmath77 ,",
    "the maps @xmath72 and @xmath78 are topologically equivalent on the interval @xmath79$]_.    the change of variable @xmath80 conjugates the map @xmath81 to @xmath72 .",
    "the result now follows .",
    "other variations of this result are possible ( e.g. by considering only odd @xmath19 , one can construct homeomorphisms between different maps @xmath72 and @xmath78 on a open interval centered at @xmath4 ) , but the point is this : the number @xmath19 is no longer a topological invariant when the maps @xmath2 are considered as real - valued , local real - analytic diffeomorphisms .",
    "note , however , that the conjugating maps ( as described in the lemma above ) possess the same hlder - type estimates as those proven in theorem [ local holder continuity ] .    now , we further expound upon shcherbakov s work .",
    "let @xmath63 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the construction of the homeomorphism of shcherbakov yields strong estimates which must be satisfied by @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , fix @xmath82 and @xmath83 . then , the neighborhood @xmath70 and the local conjugating homeomorphism @xmath5 can be chosen so that @xmath84 , where    1 .",

    "@xmath87 for all @xmath88 .    in other words ,",
    "the number @xmath19 is a ( complex - analytic ) locally - lipeomorphic invariant .",
    "we will show that these estimates hold for our conjugating homeomorphisms in our proof of theorem [ curbed ] .",
    "in fact , the proof of theorem [ lipeomorphic conjugacy ] is strongly rooted in the techniques elaborated in the paper of shcherbakov @xcite .",
    "[ section : s2 ]      in this paper we write @xmath89 for the set of positive integers , and @xmath90 for the set of nonnegative integers .",
    "we will discuss two kinds of fields in this paper :    first we have the @xmath1-adic numbers @xmath37 for a given prime integer @xmath91 . if @xmath92 is nonzero , let @xmath93 be the maximal power of @xmath1 which divides @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath37 may be defined as the completion of the rational numbers @xmath37 under the norm @xmath94 .",

    "one calls @xmath46 the ring of @xmath1-adic integers .",
    "secondly we have the general case of a @xmath1-adic field @xmath0 , which we define now .",
    "the reader should be cautioned that there are variations of this definition in the literature ; we have chosen one which is convenient for our purposes .",

    "moreover since it is a complete field with @xmath98 it contains a canonical copy of @xmath37 as well .",
