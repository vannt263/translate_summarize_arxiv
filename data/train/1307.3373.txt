    "propagation of linear acoustic waves in lattices has already been the subject of a large body of theoretical and experimental works .",
    "floquet - bloch band gaps are present in ordered lattices @xcite , whereas localization occurs in disordered cases @xcite .",
    "nonlinearities , when they are present , are usually considered at discrete points @xcite .",
    "the propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves in lattices was addressed by sugimoto and his coauthors in a series of theoretical and experimental studies , whose original purpose was the reduction of shock waves generated by high - speed train into a tunnel @xcite .",
    "the configuration under study was made up of a tube connected with helmholtz resonators ( figure [ figphoto ] ) .",
    "these resonators induce dispersion that competes with the nonlinear effects and may prevent from the emergence of shocks .",
    "more fundamental questions are also raised , concerning well - known nonlinear waves called solitons @xcite .",
    "those are stable solitary waves that maintain their shape while traveling at constant speed .",
    "solitons are caused by the cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium .",
    "many models have soliton solutions , for instance the korteweg - de vries equation , the nonlinear schrdinger equation , and the sine - gordon equation . in acoustics , dissipation is largely greater than dispersion , so that it was commonly thought that it was impossible to generate those solitary waves .",
    "thanks to the sugimoto s configuration , it was shown that acoustic solitons can exist and propagate in place of shock waves @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in figure [ figt4om16 ] , it can be seen that the original gaussian pulse of @xmath0 separated into two smooth structures .",
    "the taller one was thinner and traveled faster than the shorter one . at the last instant of simulation , we inverted these waves to initialize a new computation ( top of figure [ figt4lh ] ) . in the inviscid case ,",
    "we observe that the two waves interact like classical solitons , exchanging their shape @xcite . after separation",
    ", the shape of the wave is the same as that of the original wave , though it was shifted in location from where it would be without interaction .",
    "these behaviors were qualitatively maintained in the viscous case , even if it is less clear due to the attenuation of these waves .",
    "we have considered nonlinear acoustic waves in a tube connected with helmholtz resonators .",
    "various challenging physical features are involved : nonlinearity due to the amplitude of the waves , dispersion induced by the resonators , and fractional derivatives of order -1/2 and 3/2 due to viscous losses .",
    "our original contribution was to propose an efficient and accurate numerical modeling of this configuration .",
    "some tools are conventional ( tvd scheme for the nonlinear hyperbolic part ) , some others are novel ( diffusive representation of fractional derivatives ) . to our knowledge , it is the first time that a diffusive representation has been considered together with the advection - burgers equation . eventually , a splitting strategy has ensured an optimal cfl condition for an explicit scheme .",
    "the proposed approach is computationaly efficient : the cfl stability condition is only governed by the nonlinearity ( as in the usual advection - burgers equation ) , and a minimum number of supplementary arrays is required to discretize the fractional derivatives .",
    "this work was motivated by the experimental configuration shown in figure [ figphoto ] , previously used in the linear propagation regime @xcite , and currently investigated in the nonlinear propagation regime .",
    "our objective was to provide an efficient and accurate numerical modeling , validating ( or not ) the model ( [ edp ] ) and the underlying hypotheses .",
    "the numerical experiments showed that the viscous effects do not modify qualitatively the wave phenomena .",
    "consequently , the theoretical predictions made in the inviscid case about the existence of acoustic solitons were also obtained in the viscous case @xcite .    a first extension of this work concerns the coefficients of the diffusive representation .",
    "in some linear problems , is is possible to determine the time evolution of the energy and to prove that this energy decreases as soon as all the coefficients @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) of the diffusive representations of the fractional derivatives are positive @xcite .",
    "therefore methods leading to positive @xmath1 are usually prefered . as already pointed out ,",
    "it is the case for the laguerre method but not for the optimization method we used .",
    "one perspective is to develop an alternative method ensuring the positivity of the coefficients @xmath3 .",
    "a first possibility is to use an analytical method consisting in appoximating the function @xmath4 by rational fractions .",
    "a second approach consists in using an optimization process with a positivity constraint , for instance a shor algorithm @xcite initialized with the results from the laguerre method . in the case of propoelasticity @xcite , this method led to 10 up to 100 times more accurate results .    from a physical point of view",
    ", the dissipation effects also require further investigations . to get solitons ,",
    "it is necessary to have @xmath5 ( [ notationsedpscale ] ) , which implies @xmath6 . in this regime",
    ", the dispersion analysis indicates that the attenuation is quite low ( left part of figure 3 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "a high attenuation of waves is observed experimentally .",
    "a possible explanation of this mismatch is that some mechanisms of attenuation are not incorporated in the model . a good candidate is given by turbulence and nonlinear losses in the resonators . to account for these losses ,",
    "a nonlinear theory for the response of the resonators has been proposed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ edp2 ] ) with notations ( [ notationsedp ] ) should be replaced by the nonlinear fractional ode @xmath7 with the new parameters @xmath8 where @xmath9 is determined experimentally ( @xmath10 ) . the term @xmath11 models the nonlinearity due to the adiabatic process in the cavity , whereas the semi - empirical term depending on the sign of @xmath12 accounts for the jet loss resulting from the difference in inflow and outflow patterns @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated numerical method must be developed to integrate ( [ odeturbulence ] ) .",
    "a last extension of our work concerns the case where the height @xmath13 of each resonator may vary with position , leading to variable coefficients in ( [ edp ] ) .",
    "numerically , this requires smooth functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for instance with cubic splines , to be built . the exponential of @xmath17 in ( [ mats ] ) and ( [ splitdiffuexp ] ) needs to be computed at each grid node and at each time step , which increases the computational cost , but no other modifications are required",
    ". it will make it possible to investigate numerically the propagation of acoustic solitons in random media @xcite .",
    "this topic is a subject of intense research in various fields of physics , with possible applications in the transport of information .",
