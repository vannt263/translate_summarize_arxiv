    "the standard theoretical description of @xmath9 annihilation into hadrons at high energies starts with the sub - process of @xmath9 -annihilation into quarks and gluons , which is then studied with perturbative methods .",
    "it is usually considered as mediated by the exchange of all electroweak ( ew ) bosons : @xmath12gluons .",
    "one of the most well - known and successful predictions of the standard model is the forward - backward asymmetry , which has been studied for many years both theoretically and experimentally , particularly around the z boson @xcite .",
    "next linear colliders will explore @xmath9 annihilation at very high energies , probing further the standard model and eventually looking for new physics .",
    "as it is well known , pure qed also gives rise to a forward - backward asymmetry even at low energies , albeit small , due to interference of one - photon and two - photon exchange diagrams .",
    "this effect persists at asymptotically high energies due to the multiphoton contributions in higher orders in @xmath13 .",
    "such multiphoton contribution in @xmath14 was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in the double - logarithmic ( dl ) approximation ( dla ) .",
    "the annihilation process in @xcite was considered in the following two kinematic regions :    * forward kinematics , when , in the center of mass frame ( cmf ) , the outgoing @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) goes in the direction of the initial @xmath17 .",
    "* backward kinematics , when the outgoing @xmath15 @xmath18 goes in the @xmath19 ( @xmath4 ) -direction .",
    "these kinematical configurations refer to the case when the initial positive ( or negative ) electrical charges do not change the direction after the scattering , or they are affected by a major - almost backward - deviation .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) that at high energies the radiative dl corrections to the born amplitudes are quite different for the forward and the backward kinematics . as a result , the cross section of the forward annihilation dominates over the backward one and therefore there is a charge forward - backward asymmetry : positive muons tend to go in the @xmath4 -beam direction and negative muons rather follow the direction of @xmath19 .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize these results , accounting also for dl contributions of multiple w , z exchanges .",
    "we calculate below the forward and backward scattering amplitudes for @xmath9 -annihilation into @xmath20 -pair at energies much higher than @xmath21 and estimate the dependence of the asymmetry on the scattering angle and on the total energy of the process .",
    "we account for multiphoton exchanges as well as for multi- @xmath22 exchanges to all orders in the ew couplings in dla . to this aim",
    "we construct and solve in dla an infrared evolution equations ( iree ) for the backward and forward scattering amplitudes . in doing",
    "so we follow the approach of refs  @xcite . recently",
    "this approach was used@xcite for studying the double logarithmic asymptotics for lepton - antilepton backward scattering , for scattering angles @xmath23 in the ew theory .",
    "furthermore , in ref .  @xcite it is considered the case where the initial ( final ) state consists of a left ( right ) lepton and its antiparticle . however , because there is an essential difference in the ew theory in the description of the processes involving the left and the right fermions , in the present paper we generalize those results and consider the forward and backward annihilation with both left and right initial and final states . we also study these processes in a wider angular region @xmath24 .",
    "although we use the feynman gauge through this paper , all our results are gauge invariant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "instead of calculating amplitudes of @xmath25 quarks directly , we find more convenient to operate with @xmath26 - invariant amplitudes of a more general process , the lepton - antilepton annihilation into quark - antiquark pair . then in sect .",
    "2 we introduce such invariant amplitudes and show their relation to the forward and backward amplitudes for @xmath9 -annihilation .",
    "the iree for the invariant amplitudes are constructed in sect .  3 and solved in sect .  4 .",
    "the solutions are obtained in terms of the mellin amplitudes corresponding to collinear kinematics .",
    "the iree for the mellin amplitudes are obtained and solved in sect .",
    "then , we define and estimate the forward - backward asymmetry in sect .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in sect .",
    "we are going to account for the dl effects of exchanging the ew bosons to @xmath9 -annihilation into quark - antiquark pairs of different flavours .",
    "when multiple @xmath27 - exchange is taken into account , the flavour of the virtual intermediate fermion state is not fixed , though the initial and final states of the annihilation are well - defined .",
    "because the ew theory organizes all fermions into doublets of the left particles and right singlets , this suggests that is more convenient to calculate first the scattering amplitude of a more general process , the annihilation of a lepton and its antiparticle into a quark - antiquark pair , and only after to specify the flavour of the initial and the final states .",
    "this turns to be easier because the effects of the violation of the initial @xmath28 symmetry are in many respects neglected within the double - logarithmic accuracy . on the other hand that also means that the dla can be applied safely only when the energy of the annihilation is much higher than @xmath29 . at such energies the propagators of the @xmath26 - gauge bosons @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 .",
    "the propagator of the @xmath33 -gauge boson @xmath34 is @xmath35 in the same approximation .",
    "the @xmath26 vertices of the @xmath30 interaction with the left fermions are @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the @xmath26 generators and @xmath38 is the coupling , whereas the vertex of the interaction of the field @xmath34 with the left and the right fermions is @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the hypercharge and @xmath41 being the coupling . as in the most general process",
    "both the initial and final particles can be left and/or right , we consider all these cases separately .    in this sect .",
    "we consider the general case of the annihilation of the left lepton @xmath42 belonging to the doublet @xmath43 and the antilepton @xmath44 from the charge conjugated doublet into the left quark @xmath45 belonging to the doublet @xmath46 and the antiquark @xmath47 from the charge conjugated doublet .",
    "therefore , the scattering amplitude @xmath48 of this process is    @xmath49    where the matrix amplitude @xmath50 has to be calculated perturbatevely .",
    "we consider the kinematics where , in the cmf , both particles of the produced pair move close to the lepton - antilepton beam .",
    "it corresponds to two kinematics :    * forward kinematics when @xmath51 * backward kinematics when @xmath52    then , replacing in ( [ a ] ) the lepton - antilepton pair by @xmath53 and the quark - antiquark pair by @xmath54 respectively , we see immediately that the electric charge almost does not change its direction in the forward kinematics ( [ smallt ] ) while it s reversed in the backward kinematics ( [ smallu ] ) .",
    "obviously that does not apply strictly for the annihilation into quarks because the electric charges of @xmath2 -quarks and @xmath5 -quarks are different in sign .",
    "therefore @xmath55 -kinematics is `` forward '' for the annihilation into a @xmath56 -pair and at the same moment it is `` backward '' for the annihilation into @xmath57 quarks",
    ". we will come back to this definition of backward and forward kinematics later , when we shall discuss the annihilation into @xmath58 and @xmath59 pairs , but until then we refer to ( [ smallt ] ) as @xmath55 - kinematics , and ( [ smallu ] ) as @xmath2 - kinematics .    in order to simplify the isospin structure , it is convenient to expand the matrix @xmath60 into a sum , each term corresponding to some irreducible representation of @xmath26 . in the @xmath55 - kinematics ( [ smallt ] )",
