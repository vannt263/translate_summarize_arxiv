    "the broadband spectrum observed in blazars is dominated by beamed emission produced in relativistic jets that emanate from the central black hole .",
    "these jets propagate through a dense radiative environment , and interact with seed photons that are supplied by extended radiation sources , notably the accretion disk around the black hole , gaseous clouds in the broad line region ( blr ) , and a dusty molecular torus located at larger scales ( see , e.g. , joshi et al .",
    "2014 for a recent account ) .",
    "this interaction should affect the dynamics and emission of the jet .",
    "the primary concern of most previous works ( e.g. , dermer & schlickeiser 1993 , sikora et al .",
    "1994 , blandford & levinson 1995 , ghisellini & madau 1996 ; see also levinson 2006 and references therein ) has been the effect of this interaction on the observed spectrum , and simple emission models that ignore dynamical effects and complex structures have been constructed for this purpose , although some recent works incorporate more realistic models for the dynamics of the emitting plasma ( e.g. , joshi & bottcher 2011 , joshi et al .",
    "2014 , and references therein ) . in erc models ,",
    "the high - energy component of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is attributed to inverse compton scattering of ambient seed photons by non - thermal electrons accelerated in dissipative regions inside the jet .",
    "this process , unlike synchrotron emission , gives rise to a loss of linear momentum of emitting fluid elements and a consequent radiative drag that tends to decelerate the bulk flow .",
    "in certain circumstances , explored below , this can lead to rapid , large amplitude flares .",
    "rapid variability over the entire electromagnetic spectrum is a characteristic property of blazars .",
    "episodic gamma - ray emission with flares durations of hours to weeks is quite typical to many gamma - ray blazars , with the most extreme activity recorded in the sub - class of tev agns , e.g. , mrk 421 , mrk 501 , pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "the observed variability time imposes a stringent constraint on the maximum size of the emission region , @xmath0 , which in extreme cases is inferred to be of the order of the gravitational radius of the putative black hole .",
    "the naive expectation is that the large amplitude short duration flares seen in gamma - ray blazars originate from small radii , as the fraction of jet energy that can be tapped for production of @xmath1 rays scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is opening angle of the jet and @xmath4 the emission radius , and is small for @xmath5 .",
    "some of the variable gamma - ray flux may be attributed to a sparking gap at the base of the jet , as proposed for m87 ( levinson 2000 , neronov & aharonian 2007 , levinson & rieger 2011 ) , however , in powerful blazars the spectrum emitted from the gap is unlikely to extend beyond a few gev , owing to the large pair - production opacity .",
    "this , and the indications of correlated emission at much lower energies ( radio - to - x rays ) strongly suggest that the jets are important sources of episodic gamma - ray emission . it has been argued that in some cases the observations favor models in which the variable gamma - ray emission originates from small regions locate at large radii ( e.g. , sikora et al . 2008 , agudo et al . 2011 ) .",
    "such events may be produced by a converging shock in a reconfinement nozzle ( bromberg & levinson 2009 ) or magnetic reconnection in minijets ( giannois 2013 ) .",
    "however , recent analysis ( nalewajko et al . 2014 ) challenges the far dissipation scenarios , indicating typical emission radii in the range 0.1 - 1 pc .",
    "as shown below , on these scales the radiative drag can be substantial .",
    "in this paper we consider the effect of compton drag on the dynamics and emission of dissipative fluid shells .",
    "we show that if dissipation of the bulk energy commences not too far out , the blob experiences strong deceleration that leads to large variation of the observed flux emitted from the blob by virtue of the change in its bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the effect of compton drag on the dynamics of a relativistic jet has been considered earlier by several authors under different assumptions ( e.g. , phinney 1987 , li et al .",
    "1992 , sikora et al .",
    "our method is similar to that presented in sikora et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , however , we focus on short events that may lead to rapid flares , and compute the lorentz factor profiles and the resulting gamma - ray lightcurves for a range of conditions . for typical ambient luminosities ,",
    "the duration of flares produced by this mechanism is on the order of the characteristic size of the emitting blob .",
    "thus , flare durations as short as the dynamical time of the central engine can naturally be accounted for in this model , provided that the bulk energy can be dissipated at a large enough rate .",
    "a preliminary account of the decelerating shell model is given in levinson ( 2007 ) .",
    "here , we present an elaborated analysis of the dynamics of the flow , and also compute the resulting light curves .",
    "the construction of this model was originally motivated by the apparent discrepancy inferred in tev blazars between the relatively large doppler factors , @xmath6 , required to avoid strong attenuation of the vhe flux emitted from the inner regions , and the much lower values , @xmath7 a few , inferred from superluminal motions and source statistics ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 , levinson 2007 ) .",
    "however , the question of how the compton drag affects the dynamics and emission of dissipative outflows is of general interest , and is relevant essentially to all blazars .",
    "in the simplified model invoked here , a blob is ejected from a central engine of size @xmath8 and accelerated to a lorentz factor @xmath9 .",
    "when it reaches some radius @xmath10 cm , dissipation suddenly starts , e.g. , via formation of shocks or explosive conversion of magnetic energy , leading to continuous particle acceleration .",
    "inverse compton scattering of ambient photons then leads to a strong radiative drag that tends to decelerate the blob . in certain circumstances ,",
    "this drag may be compensated by injection of energy and momentum into the blob by some external agent , delaying the deceleration of the emitting plasma .",
    "the deceleration may be delayed also in cases where the dissipation commences very close to the central engine , where the radiation field is dominated by direct illumination from the disk and is highly unisotropic , as in this zone the blob may propagate at the equilibrium lorentz factor until reaching scales where the external radiation field is roughly isotropic ( e.g. , sikora et al . 1996 , vuillaume et al . 2014 ) . in the present model we shall refer to this case as delayed deceleration . in reality , the structure and velocity of the emitting plasma are expected to be non - uniform by virtue of confined dissipation and rapid cooling . in what follows",
    "we ignore such complications and compute the dynamics and emission of the blob under simplifying assumptions about the microphysics of dissipation .",
    "the energy and momentum fluxes of the emitting fluid are given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the proper specific enthalpy , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the pressure , proper density and proper internal energy , respectively , @xmath16 is the proper magnetic field , and @xmath17 is the bulk lorentz factor . in terms of the total power , @xmath18 , where @xmath3 is the half opening angle of the flow , we have @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 cm and @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 .    for simplicity , we assume that the ambient radiation field is roughly isotropic in the frame of the central engine , and has a luminosity @xmath24",
    ". this quasi - isotropic radiation field is contributed by scattering and reprocessing of the central uv radiation by gas in the broad line region , and by emission from a dusty torus ( e.g. , joshi et al .",
    "2014 ) . here",
    ", @xmath24 represents the sum of these components , and is a fraction of the total luminosity of the continuum source .",
    "the radial profile of the ambient intensity intercepted by the jet depends on the geometries of the broad line region and the dusty torus ( e.g. , joshi et al . , 2014 ) . denoting @xmath25 , we express it as @xmath26 with the normalization @xmath27 , such that the total energy density at radius @xmath28 is @xmath29 . for central emission , @xmath30 . for a flat profile within some scale @xmath31 , @xmath32 at @xmath33 . for the spectrum of the ambient radiation field",
    "we adopt @xmath34 that mimics a typical soft spectrum .    in the rest frame of the blob the intensity is given by @xmath35 and the comoving energy density by @xmath36 from equation ( [ is - exact ] ) it is seen that the comoving intensity peaks sharply around the direction opposite to the blob velocity , viz . , @xmath37 .",
    "to simplify our calculations we approximate the comoving intensity as a beam moving in the direction @xmath37 : @xmath38 with @xmath39",
    ". it can be readily verified that with this choice the comoving energy density satisfies equation ( [ us - exact ] ) .",
    "we further suppose that the electron distribution function is isotropic in the fluid rest frame and can be approximated as a power law : @xmath40 ; @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the corresponding electron energy , as measured in the comoving frame .",
    "we define @xmath43 to be the fraction of the total internal energy carried by the relativistic electrons , that is , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , subject to the boundary condition @xmath46 . in terms of this parameter @xmath47 , and we note that @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 . we suppose that @xmath50 reaches a maximum value over some characteristic length scale that depends on the microphysics of the specific dissipation mechanism .",
    "this length scale is typically of the order of the gyroradius of accelerated electrons , which is shorter than the cooling time of the highest energy electrons .",
    "thus , we take @xmath50 to be constant at @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of the electron distribution , @xmath52 , is likely to be limited by cooling . in the limit of bohm diffusion",
    "the acceleration time is @xmath53 .",
    "equating with the compton cooling time , @xmath54 , and adopting @xmath55 , we estimate    @xmath56    in terms of the fraction @xmath57 , @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the magnetic field at the onset of dissipation .",
    "we consider only situations in which dissipation is rapid enough to produce high enthalpy inside the blob on a timescale comparable to the radiative time .",
    "then , one can adopt a simple prescription in which the dissipation is formally treated as an initial condition ( at @xmath60 ) of the flow equations .",
    "the magnetization of the flow is then expected to be low , so that the effect of the magnetic field on the dynamics of the system can be neglected .",
    "this may not apply to cases were the dissipation time is much longer than the light crossing time of the shell .",
    "we suppose that the dissipated energy is redistributed in a way that a fraction @xmath50 of the total dissipation energy is injected in the form of a power law electron distribution , as explained above . under these assumptions",
    ", the dynamics of the blob subsequent to the onset of dissipation is governed by the equation @xmath61 where the source terms @xmath62 account for the radiative drag acting on the blob , and are given explicitly in equations ( [ s_c^0-lab])- ( [ s_c^i - lab ] ) . for a conical expansion ,",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath28 components of equation ( [ eq : mot - gen ] ) can then be written , to order @xmath64 , in the form ( see appendix [ app : eq - mot ] ) @xmath65 in terms of the coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the lagrangian derivative , and @xmath69 denotes the trajectory of the blob s front .",
    "the interior of the blob encompasses the range @xmath70 .",
    "now , for the relativistic electron population invoked above @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and to order @xmath64 the source terms , equations ( [ s_c^0-lab ] ) - ( [ s_c^i - lab ] ) , are given by @xmath73 and @xmath74      we consider first a uniform blob ( @xmath75 ) having a fixed length @xmath76 in the frame of the central engine .",
    "its motion is then characterized by a single lorentz factor at all times , @xmath77 .",
    "we suppose that microphysical processes redistribute the dissipation energy in a way that a fraction @xmath50 of the total internal energy is uniformly injected in the form of a power law electron distribution inside the blob . for clarity , we ignore here the contribution of the thermal population to the compton drag . as shown below , this",

    ", we obtained solutions also for different intensity profiles and different assumptions about @xmath100 , and found little differences in the lorentz factor profiles for a given @xmath119 in the regime of rapid deceleration .",
    "the key parameter that determines the dynamics is @xmath119 .",
    "the model outlined above assumes uniform acceleration of electrons to nonthermal energies at all times .",
    "this assumption may hold in certain situations but not in general . in shocks , for instance , particle acceleration is confined to a region around the shock front of a characteristic size comparable to the gyroradius of the accelerated electrons , as measured in the shock frame . for the highest energy electrons",
    "it is roughly equal to the cooling distance ( if not limited by escape ) . for lower energy electrons it may be even smaller . as the downstream fluid moves away from the shock , electrons of energy @xmath120 cool over time @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the comoving energy density of the external radiation ( see eq .",
    "[ us - exact ] ) .",
    "the distance traversed by these electrons in the black hole frame before cooling down is @xmath123 . using equation ( [ alpha ] )",
    "then yields @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "consequently , ic scattering off nonthermal electrons should not lead to significant deceleration of the blob , unless the entire shock energy is converted to non - thermal electrons ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "however , about half the shock energy is carried by a population of thermal electrons having an average comoving energy @xmath126 just downstream of the shock , where @xmath127 denotes the shock lorentz factor ( that is , the lorentz factor of the upstream fluid measured in the shock frame ) .",
    "these electrons cool as they propagate away from the shock",
    ". the lagrangian rate of change of the thermal energy in the downstream flow is governed by the equation @xmath128 to compute the shock structure one needs to solve equations ( [ mot - radial-0])-([mot - radial - r ] ) coupled to equation ( [ gamm_t - cool ] ) .",
    "such treatment is beyond the scope of this paper . to illustrate the effect of radiative drag on the shock we invoke the uniform shell approximation , that is , keep only the lagrangian derivatives in equations ( [ mot - radial-0])-([mot - radial - r ] )",
    "then , adopting @xmath129 and @xmath130 we obtain the rate of change of the bulk lorentz factor :    @xmath131    with @xmath95 , the solution of the coupled equations ( [ gamm_t - cool ] ) and ( [ gamm - shock ] ) reads : @xmath132^{4/7}},\\label{g - sol - therm}\\ ] ] here @xmath133dx^\\prime$ ] , and @xmath134 since @xmath135 significant deceleration is expected on sub - parsec scales .",
    "for instance , assuming a flat intensity profile below the radius @xmath136 cm , with @xmath137 erg @xmath138 at @xmath139 , we obtain @xmath140 .",
    "thus , colliding shells having a lorentz factor @xmath141 will experience substantial deceleration .",
    "now , the deceleration of the downstream plasma should lead to a gradual strengthening of the reverse shock and a weakening of the forward shock .",
    "our preliminary calculations indicate substantial over - compression of the reverse shock already at @xmath142 a few . in the frame of the central engine",
    "this translates to a deceleration of the entire shocked shell , as described qualitatively by the simple blob model outlined in the preceding section .",
    "the strengthening of the reverse shock should lead to enhanced dissipation rate , whereby the bulk energy of the unshocked shell is ultimately radiated away with high efficiency .",
    "consequently , as long as the beaming cone of emission is narrower than the angular extent of the shell , the total flux observed will remain roughly constant .",
    "thus , the delayed - deceleration model is relevant for the evolution of the total flux .",
    "however , the change in the doppler factor resulting from the deceleration of the shocked shell leads to a change in the observed energy of scattered photons and this , in turn , can significantly alter the evolution of the sed .",
    "in particular , we anticipate different durations and times of peak emission of flares observed in different energy bands .",
    "the non - uniformity of the emitting plasma downstream of the shock adds complexity .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of emission from internal shocks in blazars is given in joshi & bottcher ( 2011 ) and joshi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ignoring the effect of compton drag on the dynamics of the shock .",
    "the decay of the emission in their model is due to cooling of the emitting electrons following shock crossing .",
    "this situation is well represented by the delayed deceleration model we adopt below .",
    "the neglect of compton drag is justified only at radii where @xmath143 in equation ( [ alphat ] ) . as explained above",
    ", the inclusion of compton drag and non - uniform particle acceleration should have a profound effect on the light curves .",
    "a complete treatment of the dynamics and emission of internal shocks that are subject to a strong compton drag will be presented in a future publication .      as will be shown below , the shape of the lightcurves reflects the geometry and dynamics of the emitting material .",
    "in particular , time retardation associated with the curvature of the emitting surface sets a limit on the rise and decay times of the flare .",
    "furtheremore , as mentioned above certain situations can be described by delayed deceleration of the blob , that can have an important effect .",
    "to illustrate such effects , we shall consider also cases in which the lorentz factor remains constant at its initial value @xmath9 up to some radius @xmath144 , and only then deceleration commences .",
    "in reality , the structure of the emitting zone is expected to be non - uniform in those cases , depending on the specific model .",
    "those details may affect the resulting emission .",
    "our purpose here is merely to illustrate how dynamical effects are imprinted in the lighcurves . for this purpose",
    "our simple treatment of delayed deceleration is sufficient .",
    "moreover , this prescription also describes situations in which the radiative drag is too small to affect the dynamics of the shell , and the decay of the emission at the end of the dissipation phase is due to cooling of the emitting electrons .",
    "since we are mainly interested here in the high - energy emission from the blob , we consider only the contribution of inverse compton scattering . the spectral evolution measured by a distant observer",
    "is computed as follows : for a given choice of parameters we first solve equations ( [ eq - mot - v2])-([eq - state - v2 ] ) numerically to obtain the lorentz factor profile @xmath145 in the frame of the black hole . adopting the beam approximation , the intensity of the background radiation at any radius @xmath28 is then transformed into the rest frame of blob using @xmath145 in equation ( [ i - beamed ] ) .",

    "the rise and decay times of the observed flux are dominated by temporal delays associated with the curvature of the emitting surface . for a conically expanding shell",

    "those times might be comparable to the light crossing time of the blob if dissipation commences at a radius @xmath172 , as in the case shown in [ fig - f4 ] and [ fig - f5 ] . in the case of delayed deceleration the rise and decay times are determined by the delay : @xmath173 .",
    "the lightcurve tends to be more symmetric in this case ( see figs [ fig - f5 ] for a comparison ) .",
    "the change in the emissivity during the coasting ( pre - deceleration ) phase , as seen in the lower right panel in figure [ fig - f4 ] , is due to the dependence of the intensity of target photons and the density of emitting electrons on @xmath28 ( @xmath174 for the conical flow considered in the above examples , with intensity profile @xmath109 in equation ( [ is - star ] ) ) .",
    "this dependence may slightly affect the shape of the lightcurve .",
    "the shape of the lightcurve displayed in the lower left panel of figure [ fig - f4 ] is in qualitative agreement with those computed in joshi et al .",

    "we considered the dynamics of a dissipative shell in the presence of a strong radiative drag .",
    "our analysis indicates that for rapid dissipation substantial deceleration is anticipated in blazars on sub - parsec scales ( and even parsec scales for sufficiently luminous sources ) , that should give rise to rapid , large amplitude variability owing to changes in the beaming factor .",
    "it is worth noting that even modest changes in the lorentz factor can lead to large amplitude variations of the emitted flux , owing to its sensitive dependence on the doppler factor . in principle",
    ", this mechanism can produce flares with durations as short as the dynamical time of the central engine , at a very high efficiency .",
    "the radiative drag exerted on the thermal electrons alone should lead to rapid deceleration at radii @xmath175 cm , where @xmath9 is the bulk lorentz factor at the onset of dissipation and @xmath176 erg s@xmath23 is the luminosity of the ambient radiation field intercepted by the flow , provided the dissipation is rapid enough to keep the specific enthalpy large ( that is , @xmath177 ) .",
    "this is , for instance , the situation in internal shocks , as shown in section [ sec : shocks ] , but may also occur in other cases , e.g. , effective magnetic field dissipation in poynting flux dominated jets ( sikora et al . 1996 ) .",
    "scattering of ambient photons by non - thermal electrons accelerated in situ will dominate the radiative force if the proper scale over which electrons are accelerated exceeds @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the cooling time of the non - thermal electrons , as measured in the rest frame of the flow , and @xmath50 is the fraction of total energy carried by the non - thermal population .    in general ,",
    "the effect of radiative drag is expected to be more prominent in fsrqs than in bl lacs .",
    "nonetheless , equation ( [ alpha ] ) indicates that deceleration of dissipative shells may also be relevant to low luminosity sources , provided that electrons can be effectively accelerated to the cooling cutoff .",
    "this seems to be case in tev blazars .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere ( levinson 2007 ) that if the tev spectrum emitted during strong flares extends to energies at which the pair production opacity exceeds unity deceleration should be effective .",
    "it is naively anticipated that the gamma - ray emission produced through ic scattering of ambient photons by the nonthermal electrons accelerated in the blob will be correlated with lower energy emission generated by synchrotron cooling of the same electrons . however , synchrotron self - absorption may give rise to a strong suppression of the radio emission in cases where the deceleration occurs well below the radio core . in that case",
    ", the gamma ray flare will either precede the ejection of a superluminal component , or not be accompanied by one at all , depending on the asymptotic bulk lorentz factor and the synchrotron cooling time . on the other hand , the onset of dissipation depends on the duty cycle ( the time interval between ejections of consecutive shells in the case of internal shocks ) , and is expected to occur over a range of scales , even in an individual object .",
    "blobs that dissipate their energy at large enough radii will not experience strong deceleration . as a consequence ,",
    "a variety in the behavior of flares is expected , as indeed revealed by recent multi - waveband studies ( e.g. , marscher et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we thank noemie globus for help .",
    "this research was supported by a grant from the israel science foundation no .",
    "the general expression for the source term associated with compton drag is ( phinney 1982 ; sikora et al .",
    "1996 , van putten & levinson 2012 ) : @xmath180\\ ] ] here @xmath181 and @xmath182 denote the distribution functions of the photons and electrons , respectively . in the rest frame of the blob",
    "the electron distribution @xmath182 is isotropic , and it is convenient to compute the source terms there , and then to transform .",
    "we have @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the cosine of the angle between the photon and electron directions , and @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "the zeroth component reads : @xmath187\\\\ & = & \\sigma_t\\int d^3k'f'_r\\int d^3p ' f'_e k^{'0}\\left[(1-\\beta\\mu)-\\gamma^2(1-\\beta\\mu)^2\\right]\\\\ & = &   \\sigma_t\\int d^3k ' k^{'0 } f'_r\\int dp ' p^{\\prime 2}f'_e \\int d\\mu\\left[(1-\\beta\\mu)-\\gamma^2(1-\\beta\\mu)^2\\right].\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , @xmath188 , and using @xmath189 one has @xmath190 the spatial component reads : @xmath191\\\\ & = & \\sigma_t\\int d^3k'f'_r\\int d^3p ' f'_e k^{\\prime i}\\left[(1-\\beta\\mu)-\\gamma^2\\beta(1-\\beta\\mu)^2\\right]\\\\ & = &   \\sigma_t\\int d^3k ' k^{'i } f'_r\\int dp ' p^{'2}f'_e ( 2+\\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^2\\beta^2)=\\sigma_tn'_e<1 + 2\\gamma^2\\beta^2/3>t_r^{'0i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 now , in the black hole frame the radiation field is isotropic and we have @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "then @xmath196 thus , we finally have for the source terms in the comoving frame : @xmath197 to obtain the source term in the lab frame we perform a lorentz transformation , @xmath198.\\label{s_c^0-lab } \\\\ & & s_c^{i}=\\gamma\\beta_\\gamma^{i } s_c^{'0}+\\gamma s_{c}^{\\prime i}=-\\frac{4}{3}\\sigma_tn'_e\\gamma^3\\beta_\\gamma^iu_s[1+(5+\\beta^2_\\gamma)<\\gamma^2\\beta^2/3 > ] \\label{s_c^i - lab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for cold electrons @xmath199 , and @xmath200 , as required , since in the thomson limit invoked here the scattering is fully elastic and there should be no energy loss in the rest frame of the blob if the electrons are cold . in the lab frame",
    "we then recover the result @xmath201 .",
    "in spherical coordinates , the radial expansion of a hydrodynamic shell is governed by the equations @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are source terms that account , respectively , for energy and momentum losses by the radiative drag .",
    "the above equations can be combined to yield @xmath205 in terms of the lagrangian derivative @xmath68 .",
    "we suppose that at time @xmath66 the dissipative shell is contained between the radii @xmath206 and @xmath207 . for simplicity we suppose that the length of the shell @xmath76 is constant in the black hole frame .",
    "the velocity of the shell is then uniform with @xmath208 . transforming to the coordinates @xmath209 , @xmath210",
    ", we have @xmath211 using the relation @xmath212 , equation ( [ eq - mot - appb ] ) gives @xmath213 to order @xmath64 .",
