    "the theories of brane world and multidimensional gravity are widely discussed in the literature .",
    "they continue numerous attempts to find the origin of enormous hierarchy of energy and mass scales observed in nature , to explain the dark matter and dark energy effects , and other long - standing problems in physics .",
    "one can find a great variety of separate brane - world models in the literature : thin and thick branes in five and more dimensions , flat or curved branes and bulk , different mechanisms of brane formation , etc .    from my point of view the most natural approach is to consider the appearance of a distinguished hyper - surface in the space - time manifold as a result of a phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the early phase of the universe formation .",
    "the macroscopic landau theory of phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking allows to consider the brane world concept self - consistently , even without the knowledge of the nature of physical vacuum .",
    "it is reasonable to regard the brane world as a topological defect , which inevitably appears as a result of a phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the properties of topological defects ( strings , monopoles , ... ) are generally described in general relativity with the aid of a multiplet of scalar fields forming a hedgehog - type configuration in extra dimensions ( see @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "the scalar multiplet plays the role of the order parameter .",
    "the hedgehog - type multiplet configuration is proportional to a unit vector in the euclidean target space of scalar fields . though this model is self - consistent , it is not the direct way for generalization of a plane monopole to the curved space - time .    in a flat space - time",
    "there is no difference between a vector and a hedgehog - type multiplet of scalar fields . on the contrary , in a curved space - time",
    "scalar multiplets and real vectors are transformed differently .",
    "for this reason in general relativity the two approaches ( a multiplet of scalar fields and a vector order parameter ) give different results which are worth to be compared .",
    "it is the subject of this paper . _",
    "a priory _ it seems more difficult to deal with a vector order parameter , and , probably , it is the reason why i could nt find in the literature any papers considering phase transitions with a hedgehog - type vector order parameter in general relativity .    the spontaneous symmetry breaking with a hedgehog - type vector order parameter in application to the brane world with two extra dimensions is considered in this report .",
    "let @xmath0 be a vector order parameter .",
    "its covariant derivative @xmath1 can be presented as a sum of a symmetric @xmath2 and antisymmetric @xmath3 terms : @xmath4 the order parameter enters the lagrangian via scalar bilinear combinations of its covariant derivatives and via a scalar potential @xmath5 allowing the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a bilinear combination of the covariant derivatives is a tensor @xmath6 the most general form of the scalar @xmath7 , formed via contractions of @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the classification of topological defects with vector order parameters is most visual in terms of the  symmetric and antisymmetric parts of @xmath12 in view of @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15 the scalar @xmath7 can be presented in the form @xmath16 the last term with antisymmetric derivatives is identical to electromagnetism .",
    "it becomes clear in usual notations @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the bilinear combination of the derivatives in electrodynamics .",
    "in view of the symmetry of the christoffel symbols , @xmath19 @xmath20 and the combination @xmath21 is free of the derivatives of the metric tensor . on the contrary ,",
    "the two terms with symmetric covariant derivatives contain not only the components of the metric tensor @xmath22 but also the derivatives @xmath23    the situation with electrodynamics in general relativity is well studied , and we consider below the vector order parameters @xmath0 with symmetric covariant derivatives : @xmath24 which is the case of a hedgehog - type topological defect .",
    "the lagrangian determining gravitational properties of hedgehog - type topological defects with a vector order parameter is @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 is the lagrangian of the gravitational field , @xmath29 is the scalar curvature of space - time , @xmath30 is the ( multidimensional ) gravitational constant , and @xmath31 is the lagrangian of a topological defect .    in this report",
    "we consider only the case @xmath32 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the case @xmath33 is considered in @xcite .    covariant derivation contain @xmath34 and @xmath35 and for this reason the lagrangian has the form @xmath36 where the symmetry breaking potential @xmath5 is a scalar function of the scalar @xmath37 varying with respect to @xmath38 @xmath39 we get the following field equation in covariant form @xmath40 substituting @xmath41 into the general formula @xmath42 , \\ ] ] we get the following symmetric covariant expression for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath43 its covariant divergence reduces to @xmath44 _ { ; k}.\\ ] ] in view of the field equation we confirm that @xmath45 the field equation allows to reduce @xmath46 to a more simple form @xmath47    we use the einstein equations in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ricci tensor , and @xmath50 i omit the detailed derivations ( one can find them in my papers @xcite and @xcite ) and proceed with the results .",
