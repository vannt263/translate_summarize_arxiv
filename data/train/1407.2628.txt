    "the ever growing demand of high data rates and proliferation of a number of users for wireless services have asked for modern communications technologies that exploit finite radio resources more efficiently . among those , the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communications technique @xcite has gradually become a core component to many wireless communications standards such as lte @xcite and wimax @xcite . in the physical layer of wireless communications networks ,",
    "mimo techniques are employed in both downlink and uplink transmissions . due to practical limitations on hardware designs , downlink and uplink channels",
    "are currently designed to operate in one dimension ( i.e. , either in time or frequency domain ) .",
    "for example , cellular networks with time division duplex allocate the same frequency band , but different time slots , to downlink and uplink channels .",
    "on the other hand , cellular networks with frequency division duplex allow downlink and uplink transmissions to take place in the same time slot , but over distinct frequencies .",
    "consequently , the radio resources have not been maximally used in existing wireless communications systems .",
    "full - duplex transmissions have recently gained significant attention owing to the potential to further improve or even double the capacity of conventional half - duplex systems .",
    "the benefits of full - duplex systems are of course brought by allowing the downlink and uplink channels to function at the same time and frequency @xcite .",
    "though the gains of full - duplex systems can be easily foreseen , practical implementations of such full - duplex systems pose many challenges and a lot of technical problems still need to be solved before we can see the first trial deployment on a system level . the crucial barrier in implementing full - duplex systems resides in the self - interference ( si ) from the transmit antennas to receive antennas at a wireless transceiver . more explicitly , the radiated power of the downlink channel interferes with its own desired received signals in the uplink channel .",
    "clearly , the performance of full - duplex systems depends on the capability of self - interference cancellation at the transceiver which is limited in practice . in the past full - duplex transmission",
    "was thought infeasible .",
    "this is because the self - interference power , if not efficiently suppressed , significantly raises the noise floor at receive antennas , exceeding a limited dynamic range of the analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) in the receiving device @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", many breakthroughs in hardware design for self - interference cancellation techniques have been reported , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "especially , these studies demonstrate the feasibility of full - duplex transmission for short to medium range wireless communications .",
    "since then , several studies focusing on full - duplex communications have been carried out in a variety of contexts such as point to point mimo @xcite , mimo relay @xcite , cognitive radio @xcite , and multiuser mimo systems @xcite . with the aim of accelerating full - duplex applications in practical wireless systems , the full - duplex radios for local access",
    "( duplo ) project has been funded by the european community s seventh framework program @xcite . as a first step",
    ", the first deliverable of the duplo project has identified several potential deployment scenarios that may benefit from full - duplex communications @xcite . among others ,",
    "small cell wireless communications systems are selected as one of the important research frameworks .",
    "in fact , small cell systems are considered to be especially suitable for deployment of full - duplex technology due to low transmit powers , short transmission distances and low mobility .",
    "what is missing in @xcite is further studies that evaluate the actual gain of the full - duplex transmission for some reference systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill this gap .",
    "particularly , we consider a scenario where a full - duplex capable base station ( bs ) communicates with half - duplex users in both directions at the same time slot over the same frequency band .",
    "it is now well known that the optimal transmit strategy for downlink channels is achieved by dirty paper coding @xcite , but it requires high complexity to implement .",
    "thus , we adopt a linear beamforming technique for the downlink transmission in this paper , which has been widely used in the literature , e.g. , in @xcite . for uplink channels , the optimal nonlinear multiuser detection scheme based on minimum mean square error and successive interference cancellation ( mmse - sic ) @xcite is chosen in this paper .",
    "for the considered full - duplex system , the problem of beamformer design becomes more challenging since there still exists a small , but not negligible , amount of the self - interference between the transmit and receive antennas at the bs even after an advanced si cancellation technique is applied .",
    "we note also that the si level increases with the transmit power for any si cancellation technique . moreover , the difficulty of the design problem is increased further by the co - channel interference ( cci ) caused by the users in the uplink channel to those in the downlink channel . by this very nature , a joint design of the downlink and uplink transmissions would offer the best solution .",
    "one of the first attempts to investigate the potential gain of full - duplex systems has been made in our earlier work of @xcite .",
    "however the cci is not taken into account and several system parameters were ideally assumed therein .",
    "these practical considerations are carefully examined in this paper .",
    "we are concerned with the problem of joint beamformer design to maximize the spectral efficiency ( se ) under some power constraints . to this end , the total se maximization ( semax ) problem is first formulated as a rank - constrained optimization problem for which it is difficult to find globally optimal solutions in general . the standard method of rank relaxation is then applied to arrive at a relaxed problem , which is still nonconvex . after solving the relaxed problem , the randomization technique presented in @xcite is employed to find the beamformers for the original design problem .",
    "we note that the rank relaxation technique , commonly known as semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) method under various contexts , is widely used to solve the problem of linear precoder design in mimo downlink channels , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "very often , the relaxed problems in those cases are convex and general convex program solvers can be called upon to find the solutions .",
    "moreover , in some special cases , the rank relaxation is proved to be tight @xcite .",
    "the same property unfortunately does not carry over into our case .    to tackle the nonconvexity of the relaxed problem , we propose two iterative local optimization algorithms .",
    "the first proposed algorithm is a direct result of exploiting the ` difference of convex ' ( d.c ) structure of the relaxed problem . to be specific , based on the idea of the frank - wolfe ( fw ) algorithm @xcite",
    ", we arrive at a determinant maximization ( maxdet ) program at each iteration .",
    "the second design approach involves some transformations before invoking the framework of sequential parametric convex approximation ( spca ) method @xcite , which has proven to be an effective tool for numerical solutions of nonconvex optimization problems @xcite . in particular , we are able to approximate the relaxed problem as a semidefinite program ( sdp ) at each iteration in the second iterative algorithm .",
    "while the first design algorithm sticks to maxdet problem solvers , the second one offers more flexibility in choosing optimization software and can take advantage of many state - of - the - art sdp solvers .",
    "additionally , since there is no ( even rough ) way to estimate beforehand which algorithm is better than the other for a given set of channel realizations , the two iterative algorithms can be implemented in a concurrent manner and a solution is obtained when one of them terminates .",
    "alternatively , we run the two algorithms in parallel until they converge , and then select the better solution . the numerical results on the se and computational complexity of the two methods are given in section [ sec : numerical results ] .",
    "full - duplex transmission , if successfully implemented , is clearly expected to improve the spectral efficiency of wireless communications systems . however",
    ", a quantitative answer on the potential gains for some particular scenarios is still missing .",
    "for this purpose , the proposed algorithms are used to evaluate the performance of the full - duplex system of consideration under the 3gpp lte specifications for a small cell system .",
    "the numerical experiments demonstrate that small cell full - duplex transmissions are superior to the conventional half - duplex one as long as the self - interference power is efficiently canceled .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the full - duplex system model and problem formulation are presented in section [ sec : sm_pf ] . in section [ sec",
    ": designs ] , we describe the proposed iterative beamformer designs .",
    "the se performance of the considered full - duplex transmission is numerically compared to the conventional half - duplex one in section iv .",
    "finally , the paper concludes with future work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "_ notation _ : we use standard notations in this paper .",
    "namely , bold lower and upper case letters represent vectors and matrices , respectively ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 are hermitian and standard transpose of @xmath2 , respectively ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the trace and determinant of @xmath2 , respectively ; @xmath5 means that @xmath2 is a positive semidefinite matrix ; @xmath6 is rank of @xmath2 ; @xmath7 is the gradient of @xmath8 ; @xmath9 denotes the expectation operator .",
    "and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "linear beamforming is adopted for the downlink channel , while mmse - sic for the uplink channel . in the figure , si and cci mean self - interference and co - channel interference , respectively . ]",
    "we consider a small cell full - duplex wireless communications system in which a full - duplex capable bs is designed to communicate with @xmath11 single - antenna users in the downlink channel and @xmath12 single - antenna users in the uplink channel at the same time over the same frequency band , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd : systemmodel ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "the notations @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the @xmath15th and @xmath16th user in the downlink and uplink channels , respectively .",
    "the total number of antennas at the full - duplex bs is @xmath17 , of which @xmath18 transmit antennas are used for data transmissions in the downlink channel and @xmath10 receive antennas are dedicated to receiving data in the uplink channel .",
    "we further assume that the channels are flat fading and channel state information ( csi ) is perfectly known at both the bs and users .",
    "first , in the downlink channel , let @xmath19 be the transmitted data symbol for @xmath13 , which is normalized to @xmath20 . for linear beamforming",
    ", the data symbol @xmath19 is multiplied by the beamforming vector @xmath21 before transmission , and the received signal of user @xmath13 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 complex channel vector from the bs to user @xmath13 , @xmath25 is the complex channel coefficient from @xmath14 to @xmath13 , @xmath26 is the data symbol transmitted by @xmath14 in the uplink direction , and @xmath27 is background noise assumed to be additive white gaussian ( awgn ) . in , the first and second summations represent multiuser interference ( mui ) in the downlink channel and co - channel interference ( cci ) from the uplink to the downlink channels , respectively .",
    "the received signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) of user @xmath13 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , is power loading for user @xmath14 in the uplink direction ; @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "then , spectral efficiency in the downlink direction is given by in the numerical result section . ]",
    "rcl[eq : dl : sumrate : general ] r _ & = & _ i=1^k_(1+__i)[eq : dl : sumrateforsdp ] + & = & _ i=1^k_().[eq : dl : sumrate ]    next , for the uplink transmission , we can express the received signal vector at the full - duplex bs as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the complex channel vector from the bs to @xmath14 and @xmath35 .",
    "the matrix @xmath36 is called the self - interference channel from the transmit antennas to the receive antennas at the full - duplex bs , in which the values of its entries are determined by the capability of the advanced si cancellation techniques . in this case , by treating the self - interference as background noise and applying the mmse - sic decoder , we can write the received sinr of @xmath14 as @xcite @xmath37 where we have assumed a decoding order from @xmath38 to @xmath12 . consequently , the achievable se of the uplink channel is given by @xcite    rcl[eq : ul : sumrate ] r _ & = & _ j=1^k_(1+__j)[eq : ul : sumrate : a ] + & = & _ j=1^k_(1+q__j__j^h(_n^2+_m > j^k_q__m__m__m^h + & & + _ i=1^k____i_^h)^-1__j)[eq : ul : sumrate : a1 ] + & = & .[eq : ul : sumrate : b ]    from and , we observe that the downlink and uplink transmissions are coupled by the cci and self - interference .",
    "this problem greatly impacts the performance of the system of interest . herein , our main purpose is to jointly design beamformers so that the total system spectral efficiency is maximized under the sum transmit power constraint in the downlink channel and per - user power constraints in the uplink one .",
    "specifically , the total semax problem is formulated as a rank - constrained optimization one as    [ eq : original : se ] @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the maximum power at the bs and @xmath41 is the power constraint at each user in the uplink channel . clearly , problem is a nonconvex program , which is difficult to solve optimally in general .",
    "we also note that a simplified problem of , in which @xmath42 and @xmath43 are omitted ( i.e. , the semax problem for the downlink channel itself ) , was proved to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the np - hardness is carried over into our problem . towards a tractable solution",
    ", we first apply the relaxation method to obtain a relaxed problem of by dropping the rank-1 constraints .",
    "then , two efficient iterative algorithms proposed to solve the resulting problem are presented in the next section .",
    "note that the relaxed problem of after dropping the rank constraints is still nonconvex .",
    "thus , computing its globally optimal solution is difficult and very computationally expensive in general . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", finding an optimal solution to the nonconvex problems similar to is still an open problem . in this section ,",
    "we present two reformulations of the relaxed problem , based on which two iterative algorithms of different level of complexity are developed .",
    "the first beamforming algorithm is built upon an observation that the se of the system at hand is a difference of two concave functions .",
    "indeed , from and , we can write @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the symbolic notations that denote the set of design variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are jointly concave with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite . borrowing the concept of the fw method which considers a linear approximation of the objective function and searches for a direction that improves the objective , we now present the first joint design algorithm to find @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "first , the relaxed problem is reformulated as @xmath53 since the constraints - are convex , the difficulty in solving lies in the component @xmath54 .",
    "suppose the value of @xmath55 at iteration @xmath56 is denoted by @xmath57 . to increase the objective in the next iteration we replace @xmath52 by its affine majorization at a neighborhood of @xmath57 .",
    "since @xmath52 is concave and differentiable on the considered domain @xmath58 , one can easily find an affine majorization as a first order approximation as @xcite @xmath59+\\sum_{i=1}^{k_{\\mathtt{d}}}\\sum_{j=1}^{k_{\\mathtt{u}}}\\bigl(\\vartheta_{\\mathtt{d}_{i}}^{(n)}\\bigr)^{-1}|g_{ji}|^{2}\\bigl(q_{\\mathtt{u}_{j}}-q_{\\mathtt{u}_{j}}^{(n)}\\bigr)\\\\ + \\sum_{i=1}^{k_{\\mathtt{d}}}\\operatorname{tr}\\bigl[\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathtt{si}}^{h}\\bigl(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)}\\bigr)^{-1}\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathtt{si}}\\bigl(\\mathbf{q}_{\\mathtt{d}_{i}}-\\mathbf{q}_{\\mathtt{d}_{i}}^{(n)}\\bigr)\\bigr]\\label{eq : affine}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined as @xmath62 to derive , we have used the fact @xmath63 , @xmath64 , the inner product of two semidefinite matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 is @xmath67 , and the inner product of two vector is @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "now , we approximate problem at iteration @xmath69 by a convex program given by @xmath70 the objective in is in fact a lower bound of the se of the full - duplex system .",
    "we note that problem is a maxdet program , and hence the name of the first algorithm .",
    "let @xmath71 be the optimal value of @xmath55 in .",
    "then we update @xmath72 . in this way , the design variables are iteratively updated and the lower bound of the se increases after every iteration . since the se is bounded above due to the power constraints and , the iterative procedure is guaranteed to converge .",
    "the iterative maxdet - based algorithm is outlined in algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] .",
    "the convergence properties of algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] are stated in theorem [ thm : converge ] .",
    "generate initial values for @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "set @xmath77 .",
    "solve and denote the optimal solutions as @xmath71 .",
    "update : @xmath78 ; and @xmath79 .",
    "set @xmath80 . convergence .",
    "perform randomization to extract a rank-1 solution if required .",
    "[ randomization ]    an important point to note here is that the iterative procedure in algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] possibly returns a locally optimal solution to a relaxed problem of at convergence .",
    "obviously , if @xmath81 , then @xmath82 is also feasible to and the beamformer for @xmath13 can be immediately recovered from the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath82 @xcite . however , this may not be the case since the rank-1 constraints are dropped .",
    "thus , a method to extract the beamformer is required if a high - rank solution is obtained . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the randomization technique presented in @xcite which is mentioned in line [ randomization ] of algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] and briefly described as follows .",
    "we first generate a random ( column ) vector @xmath83 whose elements are independently and uniformly distributed on the unit circle in the complex plane , and then calculate the eigen - decomposition of @xmath82 as @xmath84 . next a beamformer is taken as @xmath85 , which is feasible to the original design problem since @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the obtained beamformer @xmath87 is then used to compute the resulting sum rate .",
    "we repeat this process for a number of randomization samples and pick up the one that offers the best sum rate .",
    "our numerical results have shown that the high - rank solutions of @xmath49 only occur when @xmath88 is sufficiently large , which is not of practical importance since this is not the interesting case for the full - duplex systems . when @xmath89 , we also obverse that the largest eigenvalue significantly dominates the remaining ones .",
    "more explicitly , the largest eigenvalue is always @xmath90 times larger then the second largest one , meaning that @xmath91 is not far from a rank-1 matrix .",
    "this explains the fact that the beamforming vectors returned by the randomization method offer a performance very close to that of the relaxed problem .",
    "explicitly , the extracted solutions achieve a spectral efficiency performance always higher than @xmath92 of the upper bound given by the relaxed problem .",
    "although the objective in is not a linear function with respect to the design parameters as in the original work of @xcite , can be equivalently transformed into the problem of maximizing an affine function over a convex set as @xmath93 .",
    "thus , algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] can be considered as a variant of the fw method .",
    "it has been reported in many studies that the type of fw methods can efficiently exploit the hidden convexity of the problem @xcite .",
    "thus , the same results as the fw - type method can also be expected in the first proposed design algorithm .",
    "however , solvers for maxdet programs are quite limited , compared to their counterparts for sdps .",
    "because none of the general convex program solvers are perfect for all problems , a more flexible choice of a problem solver is of practical importance .      motivated by the discussion above , we propose in this subsection an iterative sdp - based algorithm to solve the relaxed problem of .",
    "specifically , based on the general framework of the spca method and proper transformations , we can iteratively approximate the relaxed problem of by an sdp in each iteration .",
    "the second approach allows us to take advantage of a wide class of sdp solvers which are more and more efficient due to continuing progress in semidefinite programming . to begin with ,",
    "due to the monotonicity of the @xmath94 function , we first reformulate the relaxed problem of as @xmath95 which then can be rewritten as    cl[eq : problem : epi ] & _ i=1^k_t__i_j=1^k_t__j[eq : pro : epi : ojb ] + & 1+__it__i , i=1,  ,k_,[eq : pro : epi : c1 ] + & 1+__jt__j , j=1,  ,k_,[eq : pro : epi : c2 ] + & t__i1,i;t__j1,j,[eq : sinr : reg ] + & , ,    by using the epigraph form of @xcite .",
    "note that maximizing a product of variables admits an soc representation @xcite .",
    "thus , we only need to deal with the nonconvex constraints in and .",
    "let us treat the constraint first .",
    "it is without loss of optimality to replace by following two constraints    [ eq : split : c1 ] @xmath96    where @xmath97 is newly introduced variable and can be considered as the soft interference threshold of @xmath13 .",
    "the equivalence between and the two inequalities in and follows the same arguments as in @xcite which can be justified as follows . at",
    "optimum , suppose the constraint in holds with inequality , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "then , we form a new pair @xmath99 as @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a positive constant .",
    "obviously , there exists a given @xmath103 such that is still met when @xmath97 is replaced by @xmath104 . since @xmath105 , i.e. , the right side of remains the same , the constraint in is still satisfied .",
    "however , since @xmath106 with @xmath103 , a strictly higher objective of the design problem is obtained .",
    "this contradicts with assumption that we already obtained the optimal objective . likewise",
    ", we can decompose into    [ eq : split : c2 ] @xmath107    where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is an auxiliary variable .",
    "the purpose of introducing slack variable @xmath109 will be clear shortly when we show that it is necessary to arrive at an sdp formulation .",

    "thus , the theoretical ( worst case ) computational complexity of algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] could possibly be higher than that of algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] .",
    "we note that the complexity of the two proposed methods mainly depends on the semidefinite constraints @xmath160 , @xmath161 .",
    "that is to say , the per iteration complexity formulation used in algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] just slightly requires higher complexity than algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] . as aforementioned",
    ", the advantage of the second proposed algorithm is that it allows us to make use of efficient sdp solvers such as sedumi and mosek .",
    "alternatively , we can use both proposed two approaches in parallel for solving the original problem .",
    "the solving process can be terminated if one of the algorithms has converged .",
    "it is also possible to solve the problem until both methods converge and choose the better solution .",
    "more insights on the computational complexity of the iterative maxdet- and sdp- based algorithms are given in section [ sec : numerical results ] .    in closing this section two remarks",
    "are in order .",
    "first , the proposed algorithms are also valid for macro cell full - duplex systems ( if practically implementable ) .",
    "our emphasis on small cell setups is merely due to current practical limitations .",
    "second , the mathematical presentation can be slightly modified to arrive at a centralized joint beamformer design for a multicell deployment scenario . specifically , if all the csi can be timely forwarded to the centralized processing unit , a joint design is straightforward .",
    "obviously , distributed solutions are more interesting from a practical perspective and will be explored in the follow - up work .",
    "in the first experiment we compare the complexity and the convergence rate of algorithms [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] and [ algo : iterativesdp ] proposed in section [ sec : designs ] for two cases , the first case for independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) channel model and the second case for realistic channel model generated in section [ sub : spectral - efficiency - performance ] . in the first case , each entry of the channel vectors @xmath23 , @xmath162 , and @xmath25 follows the i.i.d zero mean and unit variance gaussian distribution . the noise power is taken as @xmath163 and the maximum transmit power at the bs and uplink users are set to @xmath164 dbw for all @xmath14 .",
    "this setting resembles the case where the average signal to noise ratio ( snr ) at transmitter sides is @xmath165 db . in the second case ,",
    "the specific parameters are taken from table [ table : sysparams ] and the allowable transmit power at the bs and the users in the uplink channel are fixed at @xmath166 dbm .",
    "an accurate model for the self - interference channel plays an important role in evaluating the se performance of full - duplex systems .",
    "thus , theoretical studies and practical measurements on this issue are of significant importance and call for more research efforts .",
    "a pioneer practical experiment on self - interference channel model has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of @xcite is that the rician probability distribution with a small rician factor should be used to characterize the residual self - interference channel after self - interference cancellation mechanisms .",
    "hence , in this paper , @xmath36 is generated as @xmath167 , where @xmath168 denotes the kronecker product , @xmath169 is the rician factor , @xmath170 is a deterministic matrix , and @xmath88 is introduced to parameterize the capability of a certain self - interference cancellation design . and @xmath170 to be the matrix of all ones for all experiments . ] in this model , @xmath88 is the ratio of the average self - interference power before and after the cancellation process and its value is fixed at @xmath171 db for the first case and @xmath172 db for the second case in this numerical simulation .    fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] illustrates the convergence rate of algorithms [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] and [ algo : iterativesdp ] for a given set of channel realizations generated randomly for the two cases .",
    "each point on the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] is obtained by solving problems and , respectively .",
    "the simulation settings are included in the figure caption for ease of reference .",
    "generally , we have observed that algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] requires fewer iterations to converge than algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] .",
    "this observation is probably attributed to the fact that algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] exploits the hidden convexity better since it searches for an improved solution over the whole feasible set in each iteration .",
    "we recall that sdpt3 is the dedicated solver for the type of problems in , and thus the choice of optimization software is limited for algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] .",
    "a recent work of @xcite has reported that , among common general sdp solvers , sdpt3 is comparatively slow .",
    "the sdp formulation in algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] allows for use of faster sdp solvers such as sedumi or mosek . in return , the total time of algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] to find a solution may be less than that of algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] which is illustrated in table [ tab : runtime ] .    in table",
    "[ tab : runtime ] , we show the average run time ( in seconds ) of algorithms [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] and [ algo : iterativesdp ] for the two channel models mentioned above .",
    "the stopping criterion for the two algorithms is when the increase in the last @xmath90 iterations is less than @xmath173 .",
    "all convex solvers considered in table [ tab : runtime ] are set to their default values .",
    "we observe that the per iteration solving time of algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] is much less than that of algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] .",
    "consequently , the total solving time of algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] is smaller than that of algorithm [ algo : iterativemaxdet ] , especially when used with mosek solver .",
    "it is easy to check that the slaters condition holds for the convex program at all iterations of algorithm 1 .",
    "thus , the kkt conditions are necessary and sufficient for optimality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.5 ) . with the dual variables introduced in table [ tab : dualvariable ] ,",
    "the kkt conditions of the optimal value at iteration @xmath56 ( see @xcite for more details ) are given as@xmath174",
    "@xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 due to property , we can replace @xmath179 and @xmath180 by @xmath181 and @xmath182 on convergence ( i.e. , as @xmath183 ) , respectively .",
    "thus,@xmath184 @xmath185 it is straightforward to see that the set of equations in - are actually the kkt conditions for the problem and thus completes the proof .",
    "we note that the kkt conditions for the convex program after convergence are also the necessary ones for local optimality of the problem .",
    "indeed since @xmath186 is an optimal solution to the convex program at convergence , it satisfies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) @xmath187 where @xmath188 stands for the inner product of the arguments , i.e. , @xmath189 , the subtraction in is element - wise , and the gradient is with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as mentioned previously",
    ", we can replace @xmath190 by @xmath191 , and thus becomes@xmath192which is the first order necessary conditions for local optimality of the problem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) .",
    "the proof of algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] follows the same spirit . as mentioned earlier for the convex approximation in , @xmath193 when @xmath125 , that is @xmath194 furthermore , we also have @xmath195 and @xmath196 let @xmath197 be the feasible set of the convex program solved at iteration @xmath56 .",
    "due to the updating rule in algorithm [ algo : iterativesdp ] ( i.e. , @xmath198 ) , follows that @xmath199 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath200 .",
    "this means that @xmath201 and thus @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the objective of at iteration @xmath56 .",
    "the convergence proof to a solution that satisfies kkt conditions follows the same steps from to presented above .        _",
