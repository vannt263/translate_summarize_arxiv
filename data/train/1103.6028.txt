    "polarization in spectral lines is the most direct and reliable signature of the presence of magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars .",
    "while the zeeman broadening of unpolarized spectra can be used , with some ambiguity , to diagnose kg - strength fields in the extremely active stars @xcite , circular polarimetry enables detection of global magnetic fields on the order of one gauss and weaker in moderately active stars @xcite .",
    "the diagnostic power of polarimetry comes from the possibility to measure very precisely magnetic signals in spectral lines against an unpolarized continuum and to boost the signal - to - noise ratio by combining weak polarization signals in thousands of spectral lines recorded simultaneously with a wide wavelength coverage chelle spectrometer @xcite .",
    "furthermore , doppler imaging analysis of the rotational modulation of circular polarization in spectral lines has resulted in detailed maps of stellar magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to many new insights into the magnetism and activity of different groups of late - type stars @xcite .",
    "despite spectacular results of the recent investigations , spectropolarimetry of stellar magnetic fields remains fundamentally limited .",
    "most importantly , high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations of all late - type stars and of the majority of early - type stars are limited to circular polarization ( stokes @xmath5 ) . a significantly weaker linear polarization ( stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 )",
    "signal due to the transverse zeeman effect has been detected and used for diagnosing stellar magnetic topologies only for a few strongly magnetic ap stars @xcite and for one magnetic white dwarf @xcite .",
    "previous spectropolarimetric observations of late - type stars in the stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters were limited to the objects where the presence of a relatively strong linear polarization was unrelated to magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "incomplete stokes parameter data sets typically employed for magnetic stars are plagued by a reduced sensitivity to the horizontal magnetic field component and , in general , do not allow a unique reconstruction of the stellar magnetic field geometries @xcite . four stokes parameter studies of ap stars also demonstrated that magnetic models based on the interpretation of circular polarization alone miss the smaller - scale magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "high - resolution full four stokes parameter observations of active cool stars represent a crucial step towards more robust and complete analysis of their magnetic field topologies . here",
    "we present the first results of simultaneous circular _ and _ linear polarization observations of active stars with a new polarimetric device : harpspol .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     the harps spectrometer @xcite , fed by the 3.6-m telescope at the european southern observatory ( eso ) , is one of the most powerful astronomical tools for precision studies of stellar spectra . it is the highest resolution eso spectrograph , providing a coverage of the 380690  nm wavelength region in a single exposure with the resolving power of @xmath8=115,000 and a long - term velocity stability of better than 1  ms@xmath9 .",
    "the new polarimeter , harpspol @xcite , is installed in the cassegrain focus of the 3.6-m telescope , feeding the two existing harps optical fibers .",
    "the polarimeter consists of two separate polarimetric units : one for circular and another for linear polarization measurements .",
    "each unit is equipped with a modulator  a superachromatic quarter - wave or half - wave plate .",
    "the light is split into two orthogonally polarized beams by a polarizing beam - splitter ( foster prism ) .",
    "the corresponding spectra are recorded simultaneously on the 4k@xmath104k ccd mosaic .",
    "a slider inserts the polarimeter from a completely retracted position , and allows for selection of either the circular or the linear polarimeter .",
    "the two orthogonally polarized beams injected into the fibers can be exchanged by rotating the half - wave plate with the increment steps of 45@xmath11 and the quarter - wave plate with 90@xmath11 steps .",
    "a combination of exposures obtained with different modulator orientations allows compensation of , to first order , flat - fielding errors and effects of seeing and other artifacts @xcite .",
    "the high spectral resolution of harpspol is especially useful for detecting complex and weak linear polarization signatures in cool stars @xcite .",
    "each of our polarization observations of cool stars consisted of four sub - exposures , which were calibrated and processed with the help of the reduce package @xcite .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional spectra were demodulated using the `` ratio '' method described by @xcite and re - normalized to the continuum intensity , yielding a spectrum in one of the stokes parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) , the corresponding intensity spectrum ( @xmath15 ) , associated error bars , and a diagnostic null spectrum .",

    "the distortions in the mean intensity profile of the primary indicate significant spot coverage at the time of our observations .",
    "the rapid changes of stokes @xmath22 are due to the orbital motion and rotation of the primary with @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25  d @xcite .",

    "using the first moment of lsd stokes @xmath5 @xcite , we derive a mean longitudinal magnetic field of @xmath26=@xmath27  g and @xmath28  g for the observations on january 4 and 16 , respectively . a weak magnetic signature in the stokes @xmath5 profile of the secondary component is also clearly detected at @xmath29  kms@xmath9   in the latter observation .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 signatures of the primary are detected in both harpspol observations with a very high confidence ( fap@xmath30 ) .",
    "this is the first detection of the linear polarization in line profiles of a cool active star .",
    "the lsd stokes @xmath31 profiles of hr1099  are significantly more complex than the corresponding stokes @xmath5 spectra and have an amplitude of @xmath1@xmath32 .",
    "no signal is present in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 null profiles ( fap@xmath33 ) , confirming that detected linear polarization is intrinsic to the star and does not arise due to an instrumental or data reduction artifact .",
    "the k2 dwarf @xmath0eri  is one of the nearest solar - type stars and the closest exoplanet host @xcite .",
    "this star is surrounded by a debris disk and shows a high level of magnetic activity .",
    "previous studies of the zeeman broadening in optical and infrared magnetically sensitive lines suggested the presence of fields with spatially averaged strength of 100200  g @xcite .",
    "no detection of the magnetically induced line polarization was previously reported for this star .",

    "the stokes @xmath5 lsd profiles change systematically from night to night throughout the rotation period of the star .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field of @xmath0eri  varies between @xmath34 and @xmath35  g.    despite a high @xmath17 ratio of our polarimetric data , the lsd @xmath6 and @xmath7 profiles of @xmath0eri  generally do not reveal magnetic signatures .",
    "however , on the night 11 january 2010 the @xmath6 signature is definitely detected , while on the other two nights a marginal signal may be present in @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 profiles",
    ". the amplitude of these linear polarization signatures does not exceed @xmath36 .",
    "rotational modulation of the linear polarization signal and its occurrence within the stellar photospheric lines suggests that polarization is unrelated to the dusty disk around @xmath0eri .",
    "the solar analogue @xmath3cena  was observed with in june 2009 , during partly cloudy conditions .",
    "nevertheless , sufficient photons were collected to reach a polarimetric sensitivity of @xmath1@xmath37 with the help of the lsd technique . as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : lsd ] , no signals were detected in either @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 profiles .",
    "the corresponding null spectra are also featureless , confirming the lack of polarization artifacts down to the level of @xmath1@xmath37 .",
    "the non - detection of the stokes @xmath5 signature corresponds to the @xmath38 upper limit of 0.2  g for the disk - averaged longitudinal magnetic field . in comparison ,",
    "the net longitudinal field of the sun as a star reaches 1  g during activity maximum and is below 0.1  g during the minimum @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that harpspol can detect the global magnetic fields of active solar twins . in its present low activity state",
    ", @xmath3cena  appears to be reminiscent of the sun at cycle minimum , in agreement with recent x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "for both hr1099  and @xmath0eri  we detected linear polarization in spectral lines with an amplitude of 0.615@xmath39 of the unpolarized continuum , which is about a factor of 10 lower than the amplitude of the circular polarization signal recorded on the same nights .",
    "for both objects the lsd linear polarization profiles appear to be morphologically complex , requiring resolving power @xmath40 for secure detection .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the cause of linear polarization in cool stars .",
    "solar - like spots are connected with a patchy , magnetic environment called `` plage '' through low - lying magnetic loops @xcite .",
    "these plage regions are usually brighter than the quiet photosphere and much brighter than the cool spots , and therefore dominate the disk - integrated magnetic signal . for an on - disk active region",
    ", linear polarization can be created if the plage is not symmetrically distributed around the spot . near the limb",
    ", the vertical components of plage can create significant linear polarization as long as there are not too many active regions such that their magnetic signals average out over the disk .",
    "the two polar regions that exhibit a weak but quite uniform outward magnetic field over a large area @xcite could contribute to linear polarization as well .    on the other hand , for stars with enhanced activity and non - solar dynamo properties , such as rs cvn binaries , linear polarization can arise from the large - scale toroidal fields mapped by circular polarization zeeman doppler imaging studies @xcite . four stokes parameters observations with complete rotational phase coverage are essential to confirm the reality of these azimuthal fields and distinguish different scenarios of their formation ."
