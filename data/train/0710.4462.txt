    "perovskite - type manganites of the chemical formula @xmath6mno@xmath2 ( where @xmath7 is a rare - earth and @xmath8 is an alkaline - earth metal ) have attracted much interest because of their colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) @xcite . historically , the magnetic and transport properties of this kind of materials have been understood in terms of double - exchange ( de ) interaction between the localized @xmath9 electrons and the itinerant @xmath4 electrons @xcite . in this model , the kinetic energy gain of the holes doped into the @xmath4 band is maximized when the spins of the @xmath9 electrons are aligned in the same direction , thereby stabilizing the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by millis _ et al . _ @xcite that the de model is insufficient to explain the huge change in the resistivity under a magnetic field and the high resistivity above the curie temperature ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "they have proposed a model including the dynamical jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion of the mno@xmath10 octahedra in addition to the de interaction and reproduced the experimentally observed behavior of the resistivity .",
    "it has also been proposed that the extraordinary enhancement of the resistivity in the manganites may result from the emergence of lattice polarons in the paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) phase @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have found that lattice polarons in nd@xmath11sr@xmath12mno@xmath2 are strongly suppressed by applying magnetic field and do not completely disappear at high fields , corresponding to an admixture of the  conducting \" and  insulating \" carriers . from x - ray scattering and neutron scattering studies @xcite , indeed , the diffuse scattering due to the lattice polarons has been observed in the high - temperature pi phase of manganites and gradually disappears with decreasing temperature in the ferromagnetic metallic ( fm ) phase . on the other hand ,",
    "several local structural studies have suggested that a dynamical or local jt distortion persists in the fm phase , too .",
    "x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) studies have shown that the lattice distortion of the mno@xmath10 octahedra is found in the fm phase of la@xmath0ca@xmath13mno@xmath2 at low temperatures @xcite . from the pair - density function analysis of pulsed neutron diffraction data",
    ", the local jt distortion has been observed in the fm phase of la@xmath0sr@xmath13mno@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if the jt distortion exists in the fm phase , the degeneracy of the @xmath4 band may be lifted already in that phase .",
    "( a ) degenerate two - orbital model ; ( b ) one - orbital model resulting from the jahn - teller splitting .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath5 and @xmath16 denote the chemical potential , the curie temperature and the hole concentration , respectively.,width=264 ]    in order to obtain insight into the competition between the de mechanism and the lattice - polaron effect , the measurement of chemical potential shift ( @xmath17 ) as a function of temperature gives much insight . according to the de model",
    ", temperature - dependent chemical potential shift occurs due to the change in the @xmath4 band width as schematically shown in fig . 1 @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath4 band is split by jt distortion and the one - orbital de model becomes relevant , the chemical potential is shifted upward for hole concentration @xmath16@xmath140.5 with decreasing temperature and downward for @xmath16@xmath180.5 @xcite . if one takes into account the double degeneracy of the @xmath4 orbitals [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , a downward shift with decreasing temperature would be expected in the fm phase for 0@xmath14@xmath16@xmath141 because the the up - spin band of the @xmath4 orbitals is less than half - filled in the @xmath6mno@xmath2 compounds .",
    "therefore , the temperature - dependent chemical potential shift is sensitive to the splitting of the @xmath4 band and therefore to the dynamical / local jt effect .",
    "@xcite have investigated the change of the work function in la@xmath19sr@xmath20mn@xmath21o@xmath2 as a function of temperature by measurements of photoemission spectra and attributed the change to the temperature - dependent shift of chemical potential .",
    "alternatively , the chemical potential shift can be deduced from the shifts of photoemission spectra because the binding energies of the spectra are measured relative to the chemical potential .",
    "we employ the latter method in this work .",
    "pi : paramagnetic insulating phase ; ci : spin - canted insulating phase ; fm : ferromagnetic metallic phase ; fi : ferromagnetic insulating phase ; co / ooi : charge - orbital ordered insulating phase ; afm : antiferromagnetic metallic phase ; afi : antiferromagnetic insulating phase @xcite.,width=245 ]    nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( nsmo ) is a suitable system for clarifying the relationship between the de interactions and the existence of lattice polarons because it shows the fm phase for @xmath22 and the so - called ce - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) charge - ordered ( co ) phase in the doping region close to the half - doping @xmath16 = 0.5 as shown in fig .",

    "we study the chemical potential shift in nsmo as a function of temperature by measurements of core - level photoemission spectra .",
    "we found that the chemical potential shift was large in the low - temperature part of the fm phase as predicted by the de model and dynamical / local jt effect and was suppressed at high temperatures near @xmath5 .",
    "we consider that the different behaviors with temperature to be related to the competition between the de interaction and the lattice - polaron effect .",
    "single crystals of nsmo ( @xmath3 and 0.45 ) were prepared by the floating zone method @xcite .",
    "x - ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements were performed using the photon energies of @xmath23 1253.6 ev ( mg @xmath24 ) .",
    "all the photoemission measurements were performed under the base pressure of @xmath25 torr at 20 - 330 k. the samples were repeatedly scraped _ in situ _ with a diamond file to obtain clean surfaces .",
    "the cleanliness of the sample surface was checked by the reduction of the shoulder on the high binding energy side of the o 1@xmath26 core level .",
    "photoelectrons were collected using a scienta ses-100 electron - energy analyzer .",
    "the energy resolution was about 800 mev .",
    "the measured binding energies were stable , because the gold @xmath27 core - level spectrum did not changed in the measurements with the accuracy of @xmath28 mev at each temperature .",
    "3 , we have plotted the spectra of the o @xmath29 , sr @xmath30 , nd @xmath30 and mn @xmath31 core levels in nsmo with @xmath3 . the vertical lines",
    "mark the estimated positions of the core levels used in the present study .",
    "we employed the midpoint of the low binding - energy slope for the o @xmath29 core level because the line shape on the higher - binding energy side of the o @xmath29 spectra is known to be affected by surface contamination or degradation .",
    "we also employed the midpoint for the sr @xmath30 and mn @xmath31 core levels .",
    "as for the nd @xmath30 core level , 80 @xmath32 of the peak height of the low binding - energy slope was used because the line shape near the midpoint on the lower - binding energy side slightly changed with temperature .",

    "one can see that the observed binding energy shifts with temperature were approximately common to the o @xmath29 , sr @xmath30 , nd @xmath30 and mn @xmath31 core levels . from the measurements of the doping - dependent chemical potential shift in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , all the core levels have shown identical shifts with hole concentration except for the mn @xmath31 core level , where the effect of chemical shift is superimposed @xcite . here ,",
    "all the core levels including the mn 2@xmath34 core level exhibit similar shifts with temperature in contrast to the measurements of doping - dependent core - level shifts @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that the shifts of the core levels are largely due to the chemical potential shift , and take the average of the shifts of the four core levels as a measure of @xmath17 as a function of temperature in nsmo .    sr@xmath33mno@xmath2 .",

    "@xmath5 denotes curie temperature.,width=340 ]    figure 4 ( b ) shows the temperature - dependent chemical potential shift in nsmo with @xmath3 .",
    "we observed a large upward chemical potential shift with decreasing temperature in the fm phase of nsmo at low temperatures .",
    "furukawa @xcite proposed an anomalous temperature - dependent chemical potential shift below @xmath5 due to the de interaction through the change of the @xmath4 band width with temperature .",
    "he also predicted that the magnitude of the shift was estimated to be about 0.1 ev when the @xmath4 band width was of order @xmath35 1 ev @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath4 band remains degenerate in the fm phase of nsmo , one would expect to see a downward chemical potential shift with decreasing temperature based on the de interaction because the up - spin band of the @xmath4 orbitals is less than half - filled for 0@xmath14@xmath16@xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the degeneracy of the @xmath4 band is lifted by the dynamical / local jt distortion , the upward chemical potential shift with decreasing temperature is predicted because the band is more than half filled for @xmath16@xmath140.5 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore",
    ", we attribute the large upward shift of the chemical potential with decreasing temperature in the low - temperature fm phase of nsmo to the change in the width of the jt - split @xmath4 band caused by the de mechanism .",
    "the magnitude of the observed shift is in quantitative agreement with the results of the one - orbital de model @xcite .",
    "we consider that the temperature - dependent splitting of the @xmath4 band may also influence the temperature - dependent chemical potential shift in the fm phase of nsmo because the intensity of the diffuse scattering due to jt effect gradually increases with increasing temperature in the fm phase , which indicates further increase of the energy splitting of the @xmath4 level @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the temperature - dependent shift would be even stronger at higher temperatures for the one - orbital case and the suppression of chemical potential shift in nsmo within the fm phase near @xmath5 can not be explained . at high temperatures near @xmath5 in the pi phase , the diffuse scattering due to the formation of lattice polarons has been observed by means of x - ray scattering and neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "we consider that the suppression of the shift in the fm phase at high temperatures is connected with the influence of the lattice polarons and the de model is no more effective at those high temperatures .     in nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with the shifts of the o 1@xmath26 core level ( in the process of increasing temperature ) and the valence band of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath36 , 0.3 and 0.4 with @xmath37 , 370 , and 370 k , respectively ) @xcite , @xmath17 for the bilayered system la@xmath38sr@xmath39mn@xmath21o@xmath40 ( @xmath3 with @xmath41 k ) @xcite and correlated hopping model of mn@xmath42/mn@xmath43 mixed - valence state .",
    "the spectral shifts have been translated to the chemical potential shift , assuming that the spectral shifts are primarily close to the chemical potential shift.,width=340 ]    in fig . 5",
    ", we compare @xmath17 for nsmo ( @xmath3 ) with the shifts of the o 1@xmath26 core level ( in the process of increasing temperature ) and the valence band of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath36 , 0.3 and 0.4 ) , @xmath17 for bilayered system la@xmath38sr@xmath39mn@xmath21o@xmath40 ( @xmath3 ) and correlated hopping model of mn@xmath42/mn@xmath43 mixed - valence state as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "we consider that the temperature - dependent shifts of the o 1@xmath26 core level and the valence band for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 are ascribed to the temperature - dependent change in @xmath17 . for nsmo and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath17 curves show similar temperature dependences in the sense that the chemical potential is shifted upward with decreasing temperature .",
    "we consider that the shifts are understood in terms of the de interaction ( and possibly the temperature dependence of the splitting of the @xmath4 band caused by the dynamical / local jt effect ) @xcite .",
    "an upward chemical potential shift by applying magnetic field has also been observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , which may be ascribed to the de interaction in the jt split @xmath4 band @xcite .",

    "@xcite is opposite to the prediction of the de model .",
