    "magnetic fields and rotation are believed to play important roles in the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores .",
    "for example , the outflow associated with a young star is believed to be related to the magnetic field and rotation of a protostar and its disk .",
    "the rotation of various molecular clouds have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who found that the rotation energy is not negligible compared with the gravitational energy .",
    "@xcite obtained strengths of the magnetic field for various molecular clouds by zeeman splitting observations and also concluded that the magnetic energy of a molecular cloud is comparable to the gravitational energy .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field is also crucial for cloud evolution , because it controls the direction of outflow and the orientation of the disk .",
    "polarization observations of young stellar objects suggest that circumstellar dust disks around young stars are aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the direction of a large - scale magnetic field of an ambient cloud and that of a small - scale magnetic field around a molecular core do not always coincide .",
    "for example , the barnard 1 cloud in perseus exhibits field directions different from the ambient field in three of its four cores @xcite .",
    "recently , high - resolution observations by @xcite have shown that the polarization angle measured in the omc-3 region of the orion a cloud changes systematically across the core .",
    "these findings indicate that the spatial configuration of magnetic field lines in a molecular core is not simple .",
    "@xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mt04 ) numerically investigated the contraction of a molecular cloud when the magnetic field lines are not parallel to the rotation axis ( non - aligned rotator ) .",
    "@xcite showed that a formed disk changes its shape into a bar or a ring depending on the angle between the magnetic field and the rotation axis at the initial stage .",
    "however , the evolution was not calculated to high densities .",
    "mt04 reinvestigated the collapse of rotating molecular cloud cores threaded by oblique magnetic fields by high - resolution numerical simulations .",
    "they found that strong magnetic braking associated with outflow causes the direction of the angular momentum to converge to that of the local magnetic field , resulting in convergence of the local magnetic field , angular momentum , outflow , and disk orientation .",
    "however , their study was restricted to clouds with an intermediate rotation rate ( @xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is expected that the evolution is affected not only by the magnetic field strength but also by the rotation rate . in this paper",
    ", we extend the parameter range of the mt04 study and explore the evolution of rotating magnetized clouds more generally .    in the case of a cloud",
    "in which the magnetic field is parallel to the rotation axis ( aligned rotator ) , four distinct evolutions are observed according to the magnetic field strength and rotation rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter papers i , ii , and iii ) . in the isothermal regime",
    "a contracting disk is formed perpendicular to the magnetic field and the rotation axis . in the disk , the magnetic field strength , angular rotation speed , and gas density",
    "are correlated with one another and satisfy the magnetic flux - spin relation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the angular velocity , magnetic flux density , gas density at the center , isothermal sound speed , and gravitational constant , respectively .    in the case of a weak magnetic field and a small rotation rate , @xmath13 , the cloud contracts spherically ( spherical collapse ) .",
    "this increases @xmath14 and a self - similarly contracting disk forms when @xmath15 is reached .",
    "on the other hand , a cloud with a strong magnetic field and/or a fast rotation rate , @xmath16 , contracts only in the direction of the magnetic field and rotation axis ( vertical collapse ) .",
    "this reduces @xmath14 and a self - similarly contracting disk forms when @xmath17 .",
    "hence , @xmath14 controls the mode of contraction ( spherical or vertical collapse ) .",
    "this is understood as follows : for @xmath13 the support forces are deficient ( support - deficient model ) , while for @xmath16 the cloud is supported laterally by rotation and/or the magnetic field ( support - sufficient model ) .",
    "the evolution can be further divided into two categories depending on whether the magnetic or centrifugal forces are more effective in forming the disk . a model with a spin - to - magnetic flux ratio @xmath18 larger than a critical value @xmath19 forms a disk mainly supported by the centrifugal force , while that with a smaller ratio forms a disk by the lorentz force .",
    "in addition to the differences in the evolution of the pre - protostellar phase ( isothermal phase ) , subsequent evolution is affected by the magnetic field and rotation .",
    "a first core consisting of adiabatic h@xmath20 molecular gas experiences fragmentation only if the initial cloud is rotation dominated , @xmath21 . in the support - deficient regime ( @xmath22 ) , fragmentation proceeds through a deformation forming a ring , while in the support - sufficient regime ( @xmath16 ) fragmentation from a bar appears as well as ring fragmentation .    based upon our previous results ( papers ii and iii ) , all models of @xcite and mt04 belong to a type of `` support - sufficient '' , @xmath16 , and `` magnetic - force - dominant '' , @xmath23 , models . in this paper , we investigate the evolution of a rotating isothermal cloud with an inclined magnetic field , not restricted to the above type , in large parameter space , and also explore three other models which have not been previously studied .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the numerical method of our computations and the framework of our models are given in  2 and the numerical results are presented in  3 .",
    "we discuss the geometry of the collapse in  4 , and compare our results with previous works and observations in  5 .",
    "our initial settings are almost the same as those of mt04 .",
    "to study the cloud evolution and disk formation , we use the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) nested grid method .",
    "we assume ideal mhd equations including the self - gravity : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denote the density , velocity , pressure , magnetic flux density , and gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "the gas pressure is assumed to be expressed by the gas density ( barotropic gas ) as @xmath30 , \\label{eq : eos}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for an assumed mean molecular weight of 2.3 ) .",
    "this equation of state implies that the gas is isothermal at @xmath34 k for @xmath35 and is adiabatic for @xmath36 @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we define the core formation epoch as that for which the central density ( @xmath37 ) exceeds @xmath38 .",
    "we also call the period for which @xmath39 the isothermal phase , and the period for which @xmath40 the adiabatic phase .    in this paper , a spherical cloud with a critical bonnor  ebert @xcite density profile , @xmath41 , is assumed as the initial condition , although a filamentary cloud is assumed in papers i  iii .",
    "the cloud rotates rigidly ( @xmath42 ) around the @xmath43-axis and has a uniform magnetic field ( @xmath44 ) . to promote contraction",
    ", we increase the density by a factor @xmath45 ( density enhancement factor ) as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the radius and the critical radius for a bonnor  ebert sphere , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath49 , which corresponds to a central number density of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the critical radius for a bonnor  ebert sphere @xmath51^{-1/2}$ ] corresponds to @xmath52 au for our settings .",
    "the initial model is characterized by three nondimensional parameters : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetic field strength and rotation rate are scaled using a central density @xmath56 as @xmath57 and @xmath58 the parameter @xmath55 represents the angle between the magnetic field and the rotation axis ( @xmath43-axis ) .",
    "thus , the initial magnetic field is given by @xmath59 in cartesian coordinates ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "the above definitions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the same as those of papers i  iii . although we added a finite non - axisymmetric perturbation in papers i  iii , we assume no explicit non - axisymmetric perturbation in this paper",

    "the models sf , mf , and wf in mt04 are also listed .",
    "the clouds in mt04 have stronger ( models sf and mf ) or equivalent ( model wf ) magnetic fields compared to our models and have an intermediate rotation rate .",
    "we calculated cloud evolutions up to @xmath73  using an ideal mhd approximation .",
    "the ideal mhd approximation is fairly good as long as the gas density is lower than @xmath74  @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "however , ohmic dissipation affects protostellar collapse , especially at high densities exceeding @xmath76 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the magnetic field is coupled with gas for @xmath77 , indicating that the assumption of an ideal mhd is valid in the isothermal phase . in the adiabatic phase ,",
    "the number density in the adiabatic core exceeds @xmath78 , and the magnetic field begins to decouple as the ohmic dissipation being effective .",
    "our simulation may therefore overestimate the magnetic field , especially for a dense core ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "since we are interested in the direction of the magnetic field , rotation axis , and disk normal in the isothermal phase , we show the results of cloud evolution mainly for low density cores ( @xmath80 ) in which the ideal mhd approximation is valid",
    ". the effect of ohmic dissipation and cloud evolution , outflow , and jets in high density cores will be investigated in a subsequent paper .",
    "we adopt the nested grid method ( for details , see paper ii ) .",
    "the nested grid consists of concentric hierarchical rectangular grids to give a high spatial resolution near the origin .",
    "each level of the rectangular grid has the same number of cells ( @xmath81 ) , but the cell width @xmath82 depends on the grid level @xmath83 .",
    "the cell width is reduced by a factor of 1/2 as the grid level increases by 1 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we begin our calculations with 6 grid levels ( @xmath856 ) .",
    "the box size of the initial finest grid @xmath86 was chosen to be @xmath87 .",
    "the coarsest grid ( @xmath85 ) , therefore , has a box size equal to @xmath88 .",
    "a boundary condition is imposed at @xmath89 , where the magnetic field and ambient gas rotate at an angular velocity of @xmath42 ( for details see mt04 ) . due to this large simulation box",
    ", it takes @xmath90 free - fall time until the alfvn wave generated at the cloud center reaches the simulation boundary , even in the model with the strongest magnetic field .",
    "hence , the boundary condition does not affect the central cloud because our calculations end within @xmath91 free - fall time .",
    "the highest level of grids changes dynamically .",
    "a new finer grid was generated whenever the minimum local jeans length @xmath92 become smaller than @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the cell width .",
    "the maximum level of grids was restricted to @xmath95 in typical models .",
    "since the density is highest in the finest grid , the generation of new grid ensures the jeans condition of @xcite with a margin of a factor of 2 .",
    "we adopted the hyperbolic divergence @xmath96 cleaning method of @xcite .",
    "our models are characterized mainly by the strength of the magnetic field ( @xmath53 ) and the angular velocity ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we calculated six groups of models , groups a ",
    "f , distinguished by the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see table  [ table : init ] ) .",
    "the models are designated by group ( a , b , c , d , e , or f ) and @xmath55 ( 0@xmath97 , 30@xmath97 , 45@xmath97 , or 60@xmath97 ) . hence , model a00 has @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , while model a45 has the same @xmath53 and @xmath54 , but @xmath55 = 45@xmath97 .",
    "models with @xmath101 are `` aligned rotators '' and those with @xmath102 are `` non - aligned rotators . ''",
    "the aligned rotator models of groups a , b , c , and d ( a00 , b00 , c00 , and d00 ) have the same @xmath53 and @xmath54 as groups a , b , c , and d in papers ii and iii and have the same magnetic field strength and angular velocity at the center , although the distributions of the density , magnetic field , and angular velocity are different . groups e and f are newly added in this paper .",
    "the evolution of the aligned rotator models can be divided into four types (  1 ) by two criteria : @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "groups a , b , and f are magnetic - force - dominant , @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and groups c , d , and e are rotation - dominant . the models are described in the following subsections (  3.13.3 ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we show the evolutions of groups a , b , and f. these groups are expected to form magnetic - force - dominant disks in the isothermal phase since @xmath107 . before disk formation",
    ", the cloud is expected to collapse spherically in groups a and b , since they are support - deficient models , @xmath108 . on the other hand ,",
    "one - dimensional collapse along the magnetic field lines is expected for model f , since this is a support - sufficient model , @xmath109 .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the evolution of groups a and b. figures  [ fig:1 ] ( a)(d ) shows the evolution for model a45 .",
    "model a45 has the parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "this cloud rotates slowly ( @xmath113 ) around the @xmath43-axis , and has a weak magnetic field ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( a ) shows the initial state of model a45 .",
    "the cloud is threaded by a magnetic field running in the direction @xmath112 .",

    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( b ) shows that the magnetic field lines run in a direction at an angle @xmath117 from the @xmath43-axis , similar to the large - scale view ( @xmath86 ) of figure  [ fig:1 ] ( a ) , though they are squeezed near the center .",
    "the green colored disks in figures  [ fig:1 ] ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) indicate regions of @xmath118 on the mid - plane parallel to the disk - like structure ( perpendicular to the disk normal ) . from the density contour lines in the @xmath60-@xmath43 plane of figure  [ fig:1 ] ( b ) , it can be seen that the high density region is slightly flattened and the cloud collapses along the magnetic field lines .",
    "we derive three principal axes ( @xmath119 ) from the moment of inertia according to mt04 .",
    "we define the shortest axis @xmath120 to be the disk normal axis and define @xmath121 and @xmath122 to be the long and short axes on the disk mid - plane .",
    "the oblateness and axis - ratio of the high - density region of @xmath123 are defined here as @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] plots the oblateness ( upper panel ) and axis - ratio ( lower panel ) against the central density for group a. for model a45 , the oblateness reaches @xmath126 at the epoch of figure  [ fig:1 ] ( b ) ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this means that the high - density region maintains a spherical structure at this epoch .",
    "the axis - ratio grows only to @xmath128 at the same epoch .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( c ) shows the high - density region at the core formation epoch ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the angle between the disk normal and the @xmath43-axis has increased to @xmath130 , although that between the magnetic field lines and the @xmath43-axis is @xmath131 , similar to figure  [ fig:1 ] ( b ) . figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the loci of the magnetic field @xmath96 ( @xmath132 ) , the rotation axis @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , and the normal vector of the disk @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) , all averaged within @xmath137 . each vector is projected on the @xmath138 plane and the distance from the origin represents the angle between a given vector and the @xmath43-axis . for example , a vector parallel to the @xmath61-axis is plotted at ( 0@xmath97 , 90@xmath97 ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig:3 ] indicates that the magnetic field rotates around the @xmath43-axis from @xmath139 to @xmath140 during the calculation , keeping the same angle with respect to the @xmath43-axis ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "it can also be seen that the disk normal ( the solid line ) stays parallel to the magnetic field after @xmath142 , showing that a disk structure is formed perpendicular to the magnetic field and rotates with the magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", the rotation axis , represented by the broken line , points in the direction @xmath143 before @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the rotation axis maintains its initial direction in the isothermal phase .",
    "we summarize the angles of the magnetic field ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) , rotation axis ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 ) , and disk normal ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) at the end of the isothermal phase in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "the angles between the magnetic field and the rotation axis @xmath151 , those between the magnetic field and disk normal @xmath152 , and those between the rotation axis and the disk normal @xmath153 are also listed in table  [ table : results ] .",

    "the oblateness reaches @xmath157 at the core formation epoch ( figure  [ fig:2 ] upper panel ) .",
    "this oblateness is smaller than that of model as ( @xmath158 ) of paper ii .",
    "the increase in the initial central density from @xmath159 ( paper ii ) to @xmath160 suppresses the growth of oblateness .",
    "the disk forms slowly compared with models with large @xmath53 or @xmath54 , similar to paper ii .",
    "the axis - ratio grows only to @xmath161 at the end of the isothermal phase .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( d ) shows the central region at 140 yr after the core formation epoch ( @xmath162 ) . at this stage ,",
    "the directions of the magnetic field and disk normal are parallel to each other and co - rotate around the @xmath43-axis , keeping the angles @xmath163 the magnetic field and disk normal vector continue to rotate up to @xmath164 at the end of the calculation period ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "the rotation axis begins to move away from the @xmath43-axis at the beginning of the adiabatic phase , and has an angle @xmath166 with respect to the @xmath43-axis at the end of the calculation ( asterisk ) .",
    "it can be seen that the three axes ( @xmath96 , @xmath133 , and @xmath135 ) are in alignment in the adiabatic stage , as seen in mt04 .",
    "although the disk becomes thinner in the adiabatic phase , the oblateness is no more than @xmath167 , as shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "when the central density exceeds @xmath168 , the oblateness gradually decreases and the central region becomes spherical owing to the thermal pressure .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] indicates that the oblateness depends only slightly on @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution of the axis - ratio clearly depends on @xmath55 .",
    "the axis - ratio grows faster in models with larger @xmath55 .",
    "the growth of the axis - ratio must be due to non - axisymmetry in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field in magnetic - force - dominated models .",
    "such non - axisymmetry is induced by the centrifugal force due to the rotation motion with @xmath133 in the disk plane , which vanishes in an aligned rotator for which @xmath169 thus , the axis - ratio does not grow in model a00 , for which the initial magnetic field lines are parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "this tendency is more marked in group c. we will discuss the correlation of the axis - ratio and the initial angle @xmath55 in  3.2 .",
    "although the high - density region rotates slightly around the rotation axis @xmath133 in the isothermal collapse phase [ figure  [ fig:1 ] ( a)(c ) ] , it begins to rotate in the adiabatic phase [ figure  [ fig:1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) ] when the gravitational collapse is suppressed by the thermal pressure . comparing figures  [ fig:1 ] ( c ) and ( d )",
    ", we can see the magnetic field lines and the disk - normal rotate around the @xmath43-axis .",

    ", we can not see any differences in the angles @xmath145 , @xmath147 , and @xmath149 of model a00 , because these angles are all zero .",
    "the angles @xmath145 ( broken lines ) show that the magnetic field hardly changes with respect to the @xmath43-axis until the end of the calculation period .",
    "thus , the magnetic field maintains its initial zenithal angle for group a. in contrast , the disk normal changes to the direction of the magnetic field after the central density exceeds @xmath170 for all models a00 , a30 , a45 , and a60 .",
    "hence , we can see that the disk is formed perpendicular to the magnetic field , irrespective of the initial angle @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotation axis maintains its initial direction ( @xmath43-axis ) in the isothermal phase and then begins to move away from the @xmath43-axis in the adiabatic phase .",
    "the angles @xmath146 and @xmath150 increase slightly in the isothermal phase because the clouds rotate slowly .",
    "figures  [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:4 ] clearly show that the evolutions of the oblateness and the angles @xmath145 , @xmath147 , and @xmath149 do not qualitatively depend on the initial angle @xmath55 , while the angles of the disk normal do depend on @xmath55 .    at the end of the calculation period for model a45 , a disk structure",
    "is found in the region @xmath171 au , where the cloud has an oblateness of @xmath172 . in this region ,",
    "the direction of the disk normal varies depending on the disk scale .",
    "the disk normal is directed toward @xmath173 , which is almost parallel to the magnetic field for @xmath174 au . on the other hand , for a disk in the range @xmath175 - @xmath176 au , @xmath149 increases from @xmath177 ( @xmath178 au ) to @xmath179 ( @xmath180 au ) .",
    "thus , the disk normal gradually becomes inclined and approaches the magnetic field direction , moving towards the center .",
    "the magnetic field strength also depends on the scale .",
    "it increases as the center is approached and has a maximum at the center .",
    "next , we focus on group b ( @xmath181 , @xmath113 ) which has a magnetic field @xmath182-times stronger than group a. the left panel of figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the same information as figure  [ fig:3 ] for model b45 ( @xmath183 ) . the cloud structure , magnetic field lines , and velocity vectors for model b45 at the end of the isothermal phase",
    "are shown in the right panel , for which the contour , streamline , isosurface , and other notations have the same meanings as in figure  [ fig:1 ] . in group",
    "b , a disk is formed perpendicular to the magnetic field , similar to group a. the direction of the magnetic field rotates around the @xmath43-axis , keeping the initial angle @xmath55 , similar to model a45 .",
    "the directions of the magnetic field and the disk normal also coincide for model b45 .",
    "the angles @xmath146 and @xmath150 , however , increase slightly in the isothermal phase , compared with model a45 .",
    "since the initial rotation speed @xmath113 is common for groups a and b , this difference must be due to the growth rate of the angular velocity @xmath184 , which is smaller in group b than in group a , as shown in paper ii .",
    "the growth rates of the angular velocity ( @xmath184 ) and magnetic flux density ( @xmath185 ) are large when the cloud collapses spherically ( @xmath186 ) , while they are small when the cloud collapses laterally ( @xmath187 ) ( paper ii ) .",
    "a cloud with a strong magnetic field ( group b ) forms a disk earlier than that with a weak magnetic field ( group a ) , and thus , the growth rate of the angular velocity in group b decreases from @xmath188 to @xmath189 at an earlier epoch than for group a. further , magnetic braking is more effective in group b than in group a , since the initial magnetic field is stronger in group b. model b45 has @xmath190 at the end of isothermal phase , while model a45 has @xmath191 ( table  [ table : results ] ) .",
    "that is , the rotation axis is more inclined with respect to the @xmath43-axis in model b45 than in model a45 .",
    "this inclination is caused by magnetic braking ( mt04 ) .",
    "mt04 show that magnetic braking works more effectively for the perpendicular component of angular momentum to the magnetic field than for the parallel component .",
    "the angular velocity in model b45 is slower than model a45 for the following two reasons , prompt disk formation and effective magnetic braking .",
    "the direction of the rotation axis oscillates violently around the @xmath43-axis in the adiabatic phase ( figure  [ fig:5 ] ) because magnetic braking is so effective , as noted in mt04 ( model mf ) and paper ii . in conclusion , groups a and b exhibit a disk perpendicular to the magnetic field line irrespective of the initial angle @xmath55 .",
    "group f models are magnetic - force dominant , similar to groups a and b but with a strong magnetic field .",
    "group f has the parameters @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "as group f clouds have a stronger magnetic field and rapid rotation at the initial stage , to promote cloud contraction we set a larger density enhancement factor for group f ( @xmath194 ) compared with that of groups a and b ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "we can confirm that the density enhancement factor does not greatly affect cloud evolution ( see models a45 and [ n ] , or models b45 and [ o ] in table  [ table : results ] ) .",
    "the models in group f form disks through the magnetic force , as for models a45 and b45 . for group f models ,",
    "the cloud collapses along the magnetic field lines and contraction crossing the magnetic field lines is suppressed by the strong lorentz force , while for models a45 and b45 , the cloud collapses spherically .",
    "the locus of the disk normal ( @xmath135 ) traces that of the magnetic field ( @xmath96 ) in the left panel of figure  [ fig:6n ] .",

    "first , we consider the aligned rotator models ( models with @xmath252 ) and compare them with those of paper ii . comparing the solid lines ( @xmath101 models ) of figure  [ fig:15n ] with those of figure  12 in paper ii , we can see the evolution locus is almost the same .",
    "that is , ( 1 ) the points move from the lower - left to the upper - right inside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line , whereas ( 2 ) those distributed outside the line move from the upper - right to the lower - left ; ( 3 ) the slope of each evolution path is @xmath253 and ( 4 ) the evolution paths finally converge to equation  ( [ eq : ul2 ] ) for the isothermal phase . however , the evolution paths for models c00 and d00 , which are located outside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line have slightly smaller angular velocities [ @xmath254@xmath255 than those of models c and d of paper ii [ @xmath256 .",

    "although the clouds collapse vertically ( vertical collapse ) for the models c , d , c00 , and d00 until the magnetic field and rotation satisfy the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation , the vertical collapse overshoots the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line for initially unstable clouds in models c00 and d00 .",
    "this difference can also be seen in comparing the density increase rate .",
    "the increase of the central density can be approximated by @xmath260 $ ] in model c00 , where @xmath261 is the time at which the central density becomes infinite for the isothermal phase .",

    "this difference is also seen in the evolution of the oblateness .",
    "for example , the oblateness reaches @xmath265 in model c00 , while it reaches only @xmath266 in model c. thus , a thinner disk is formed in model c00 , which has a more unstable initial state .    the evolution locus of model f00 moves towards the upper - right in the period @xmath267 in figure  [ fig:15n ] .",
    "this indicates that the cloud collapses spherically in this period , as for models a00 and b00 , because the cloud is more unstable against the gravity than those of groups c and d. group f has the same thermal energy as groups c and d , but has smaller rotational and magnetic energies , as shown in table  [ table : init ] .",
    "thus , in model f00 , the cloud collapses spherically in the early phase of the isothermal collapse .",
    "however , the collapse becomes anisotropic in the late phase of isothermal collapse because the magnetic force becomes effective .",
    "although there are a few differences between the models , the convergence to the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation curve is evident , irrespective of the initial cloud shape and the distributions of the density , magnetic field , and angular velocity when the magnetic field is parallel to the rotation axis . this is natural because the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation is satisfied for the central part of the cloud and information on the outer part of the cloud is lost as the cloud collapses in the isothermal phase , as noted by @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the non - aligned rotator models ( @xmath268 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig:15n ] , the dotted , broken , and dash - dotted lines show the evolution paths of models with @xmath269 = 30@xmath97 , 45@xmath97 , and 60@xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the points located inside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line ( non - aligned rotator models in groups a , b , and e ) move from the lower - left to the upper - right , as for the aligned rotator models .",
    "these models have almost the same loci as the aligned rotator models and converge to the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line . on the other hand , models located outside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line (",
    "non - aligned rotator models in groups c , d , and f ) show different evolutions than the aligned rotators .",
    "the non - aligned rotator models c30 , c45 , and c60 evolve towards the _ lower - right _ , then reverse their direction after they reach the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line .",
    "thus , the evolution of the angular velocity in the non - aligned rotator models c30 , c45 , and c60 is the same as that of the aligned rotator model c00 , while the evolution of the magnetic field is different . the magnetic field strength normalized by the gas pressure increases in non - aligned rotator models , but decreases in aligned rotator models .",
    "the evolution paths of non - aligned rotator models of group f ( f40 , f45 , and f60 ) are toward the upper - left .",
    "thus , the magnetic field strength normalized by the thermal pressure approaches the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line in these models , while the angular velocity normalized by the free - fall timescale continues to increase in the isothermal collapse phase .",
    "the evolution paths for models d30 , d45 , and d60 oscillate in the @xmath270@xmath271 plane , moving away from the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line .",
    "the growths of the magnetic field strength and angular velocity depend on the geometry of the collapse ( vertical collapse to form a disk , spherical collapse , or lateral collapse in a disk ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:16n ] is similar to figure  [ fig:15n ] , but with the magnetic field strength and the angular velocity parallel to the disk normal .",
    "that is , @xmath272 in the abscissa and @xmath273 in the ordinate are defined as @xmath274 @xmath275 where @xmath96 , @xmath133 , and @xmath276 represent the magnetic flux density vector , angular velocity vector , and the unit vector of the disk normal .",
    "the starting points of each locus are different even for models with the same @xmath53 and @xmath54 but different @xmath55 ( c.f .",

    "we plotted the loci according to equations  ( [ eq : bp ] ) and ( [ eq : wp ] ) subsequent to the formation of a disk structure .",
    "the figure shows that all the evolution paths of models with the same @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( e.g. a00 and a45 ) move in the same direction irrespective of @xmath55 , even though the starting points are different .",
    "clouds for the models inside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line ( support - deficient models : groups a , b , and e ) evolve towards the upper - right , regardless of the initial angle @xmath55 in figure  [ fig:16n ] .",
    "clouds having parameters inside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line collapse spherically until the magnetic field strength and angular velocity reach the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line , as shown in  4.1 .",
    "the clouds evolve isotropically ( spherically ) , because the anisotropy caused by the magnetic or centrifugal force is not induced before the clouds reach the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line for small initial magnetic and rotational energies .",
    "thus , the evolution direction of the non - aligned rotator models a45 , b45 , and e45 is the same as that of the non - aligned rotator models a00 , b00 , and e00 in figure  [ fig:15n ] , though the angles between the magnetic field and rotation axis are different .",
    "this is because the anisotropy grows only slightly during spherical collapse .    for the support - sufficient models , the evolution paths of the non - aligned rotator models c45 , d45 , and f45 are not the same as the aligned rotator models c00 , d00 , and",

    "in which the magnetic field is not parallel to the rotation axis and the magnetic field does not affect the cloud evolution , as seen in model c45 , the cloud collapses along the rotation axis and the lateral collapse is suppressed by the centrifugal force .",
    "the cloud then forms a disk perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "the magnetic field and angular velocity parallel to the disk normal increase slightly for this collapse ( @xmath273 and @xmath277 constant ) .",

    "the magnetic field , rotation axis , and disk normal have different directions when the magnetic field is not parallel to the rotation axis at the initial stage , although they have are identical for an aligned rotator .",
    "we can assess the dominant force for disk formation using the evolution loci of the direction of the magnetic field , rotation axis , and disk normal . when a disk is formed perpendicular to the magnetic field , the disk normal moves in association with a small - scale magnetic field in magnetic - force - dominant models ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "a similar evolution is seen in rotation - dominated models .",
    "we compare the evolution of 16 models with different @xmath53 and @xmath54 but the same @xmath55 .",
    "we choose the initial angle between the magnetic field and rotation axis as @xmath282 , because the cloud evolution does not depend on @xmath55 , as shown in  3.1 and  3.2 .",
    "the angles ( @xmath145 , @xmath147 , @xmath149 ) , ( @xmath146 , @xmath148 , @xmath150 ) , and ( @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath153 ) ; the dominant force for forming a disk ( @xmath185 or @xmath184 ) ; and the axis - ratio ( @xmath285 ) at the end of the isothermal phase are all listed in table  [ table : results ] . the dominant force for disk formation",
    "is determined by the loci of the magnetic field , rotation axis , and disk normal for the isothermal phase .",
    "for example , the locus of the disk normal moves together with that of the magnetic field in magnetic - force - dominant models .",
    "the shapes of the clouds at the core formation epoch are shown in figure  [ fig:17n ] . in this figure , each panel is positioned based on the initial magnetic field strength and angular velocity .",
    "the figure shows that the disk normals are almost parallel to the @xmath43-axis in the upper - left region , while they are parallel to the magnetic field in the lower - right region .",
    "this is natural since the cloud is initially rotating rapidly and magnetized weakly in the upper - left region , while it rotates slowly and is magnetized strongly in the lower - right region .    in order to compare the cloud evolutions with different initial angular velocities we focus on four models with @xmath53 = 0.01 and different @xmath54 = 0.3 , 0.1 , 0.03 , and 0.01 [ models ( b ) , ( f ) , ( j ) , and ( n ) ] , shown in figure  [ fig:17n ] .",
    "these models are aligned in the second column of figure  [ fig:17n ] .",
    "the disk normal is oriented with the @xmath43-direction , and the magnetic field lines are inclined from the @xmath43-axis in the models with large @xmath54 [ ( b ) and ( f ) ] .",
    "each model has a small angle between the rotation axis and the @xmath43-axis [ @xmath191 ( b ) , @xmath286 ( f ) , 2@xmath97 ( j ) , and 5@xmath97 ( n ) ] .",
    "thus , it is shown that the cloud evolves maintaining the direction of the initial rotation axis .",
    "on the other hand , the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath43-axis increases with increasing initial angular velocity @xmath54 [ @xmath145 = @xmath287",
    "( b ) , @xmath288 ( f ) , 54@xmath97 ( j ) , and 46@xmath97 ( n ) ] . the magnetic field in models ( b ) and ( f ) is almost perpendicular to the rotation axis and the disk normal ( @xmath283 , @xmath289 ) .",
    "it appears that the disk is formed by the effect of rotation in models ( b ) and ( f ) , because the angle between the rotation axis and disk normal is small [ @xmath290 ( b ) and @xmath291 ( f ) ] . on the other hand",
    ", the disk seems to be formed by the magnetic force in models ( j ) and ( n ) , because the angles @xmath284 [ @xmath292 ( j ) and @xmath293 ( n ) ] are smaller than those of @xmath153 [ @xmath294 ( j ) and @xmath295 ( n ) ] .",
    "the axis - ratio increases with increasing @xmath54 [ @xmath296 ( b ) , 0.18 ( f ) , @xmath297 ( j ) , and @xmath298 ( n ) ] , because the disk forms earlier in a model with larger @xmath54 .",
    "next , we focus on four models with the same @xmath299 but different @xmath53 = 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1 [ models ( e ) , ( f ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) ] , in order to compare cloud evolution with different initial magnetic field strengths . these models are aligned in the second row of figure  [ fig:17n ] .",
    "the disk normals are considerably inclined from the @xmath43-axis in the models with strong magnetic field , ( g ) and ( h ) .",
    "this inclination indicates that the disk is formed by the effect of the magnetic force .",
    "the disk is perpendicular to the rotation axis in model ( e ) [ ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) = ( 83@xmath97 , 1@xmath97 ) ] , while the disk is perpendicular to the local magnetic field rather than the rotation axis in model ( h ) [ ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) = ( 2@xmath97 , 11@xmath97 ) ] .",
    "the angle between the rotation axis and the disk normal ( @xmath153 ) is smaller in model ( h ) ( @xmath300 ) than in model ( g ) ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "this seems to be due to the fact that the angular momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field in models with @xmath302 is effectively removed by the magnetic braking process , and thus the direction of rotation tends to incline to the magnetic field and the disk normal . as a result , the rotation axis is considerably inclined from the initial direction in models with a strong magnetic field [ @xmath303 = 0 ( e ) , 3 ( f ) , 16 ( g ) , and 32 ( h ) ] .",
    "the magnetic field is parallel to the disk in models with small @xmath53 [ e.g. @xmath304 ( e ) ] , while the magnetic field maintains its initial direction in models with large @xmath53 [ e.g. @xmath305 ( h ) ] .",
    "the azimuthal directions of the magnetic field ( @xmath146 ) and disk normal ( @xmath150 ) coincide in models ( e ) , ( f ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) . in these models ,",
    "the gas contracts along the magnetic field line onto the disk mid - plane , then a non - axisymmetric structure ( i.e. bar structure ) is formed perpendicular to the magnetic field , as discussed in  3.2 .",
    "the non - axisymmetry tends to increase with the initial magnetic field strength [ see models ( e ) , ( f ) , and ( g ) ] , except for model ( h ) .",
    "the role of the magnetic field in magnetic - force - dominant models is similar to that of the centrifugal force in rotation - dominant models .",
    "the disk orientation is essentially determined by the direction of the dominant force . however , there is at least one quantitatively different point between the two types of models .",
    "namely , the angular momentum is transferred by the magnetic braking in the magnetic - dominant models . the dominant force ( @xmath185 or @xmath184 ) for disk formation is summarized in table  [ table : results ] and figure  [ fig:17n ] .",
    "the shadowed region in the lower - right part of figure  [ fig:17n ] indicates disks formed by the lorentz force , while the upper - left region indicates disks formed by the centrifugal force .",
    "a broken line between these two indicates the border between the magnetic - force - dominant and rotation - dominant disks , which is well fitted by @xmath306 similar to the result for aligned rotators .",
    "cloud evolution can be classified into four patterns using the generalized @xmath185-@xmath184 relation curve @xmath307 and equation  ( [ eq : ul3 ] ) : ( i ) support - deficient , rotation - dominant models [ inside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line and above equation  ( [ eq : ul3 ] ) ] , ( ii ) support - deficient , magnetic - force - dominant models [ inside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line and below equation  ( [ eq : ul3 ] ) ] , ( iii ) support - sufficient , rotation - dominant models [ outside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line and above equation  ( [ eq : ul3 ] ) ] , and ( iv ) support - sufficient , magnetic - force - dominant models [ outside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line and below equation  ( [ eq : ul3 ] ) ] . in the models of class ( i ) [ models ( e ) , ( f ) , ( g ) , and ( i ) ] , the cloud collapses slowly , maintaining spherical symmetry , and then a disk forms due to the rotation . in this type of evolution",
    ", the magnetic field hardly changes its initial direction . on the other hand , in the models of class ( iii ) [ models ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ]",
    ", the cloud collapses along the rotation axis owing to the strong centrifugal force , and then a thin disk is formed in the early isothermal collapse phase .",
    "the magnetic field lines run along the disk plane , because the magnetic field lines are compressed together with a cloud in these models . in the rotation - dominant models of classes ( i ) and ( iii ) ,",
    "the rotation axis maintains its initial direction because the magnetic braking is not so effective . on the other hand , in the magnetic - force - dominant models of classes ( ii ) and",
    "( iv ) , the rotation axis is inclined from the initial direction because the clouds with strong magnetic fields experience effective magnetic braking .",
    "the inclination of the rotation axis , @xmath147 in class ( iv ) is greater than that in class ( ii ) .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field , however , tends to maintain its initial direction relative to the @xmath43-axis in classes ( ii ) and ( iv ) for a strong magnetic tension force .",
    "fragmentation is considered to be one of the mechanisms producing binary and multiple stars .",
    "we investigated fragmentation of a rotating magnetized cloud in paper iii for the case of @xmath308 .",
    "we found fragmentation only in rotation - dominant clouds .",
    "this indicates that fragmentation is suppressed by the magnetic field , similar to the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fragmentation occurs via a global bar or ring mode and depends on the initial amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation in support - sufficient rotation - dominant clouds .",
    "that is , when the non - axisymmetric structure barely grows in the isothermal phase and the rotation rate reaches @xmath309 at the core formation epoch , an adiabatic core fragments via a ring ( ring fragmentation ) . on the other hand , when the core is deformed to an elongated bar at the core formation epoch , the bar fragments into several cores ( bar fragmentation ) .",
    "the parameter study in paper iii shows that ring fragmentation is seen in rotation - dominant models in the adiabatic phase [ classes ( i ) and ( iii ) ] and bar fragmentation is observed only in support - sufficient rotation - dominant models [ class ( iii ) ] .",
    "support - deficient and support - sufficient magnetic - dominant models [ classes ( ii ) and ( iv ) ] evolve into a single dense core without fragmentation owing to effective magnetic braking and a slow rotation .",
    "the results obtained in paper iii show that fragmentation patterns are dependent on the growth of a non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "the non - axisymmetric perturbation begins to grow after a thin disk is formed .",
    "the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric mode barely grows in support - deficient rotation - dominant models [ class ( i ) ] , because the disk forms slowly , as shown in  3.1 . on the other hand",
    ", the non - axisymmetric structure grows sufficiently in support - sufficient rotation - dominant models [ class ( iii ) ] , because the disk forms promptly . in class ( iii ) , the patterns of fragmentation are dependent on the initial amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "thus , a cloud fragments through a ring when the cloud has a small amount of initial non - axisymmetric perturbations , whereas the cloud fragments through a bar when it has a sufficient amount of initial non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "these results apply to aligned rotator clouds . below we extend the study to the evolution of non - aligned rotator models .",
    "we did not add any explicit non - axisymmetric perturbations to the initial state of non - aligned rotator models .",
    "we did not find any rings for the rotation - dominant models of non - aligned rotators . in the rotation - dominant models ,",
    "non - axisymmetry arises from the magnetic force in the case of @xmath310 .",
    "since this non - axisymmetric perturbation from the magnetic force grows sufficiently in the isothermal phase , bar fragmentation must occur in non - aligned rotator models .",
    "as detailed previously , the axis - ratio ( @xmath285 ) , listed in table  [ table : results ] , arises from an anisotropic force due to the magnetic field or rotation .",
    "model ( c ) has the greatest axis - ratio @xmath311 of all models .",
    "the initial state of this cloud is outside the @xmath185-@xmath184 relation line , and has the strongest magnetic field in rotation - dominant models ( figure  [ fig:17n ] ) . in this cloud ,",
    "a disk is formed perpendicular to the rotation axis and the magnetic field parallel to the disk surface is greatly amplified .",
    "this induces a bar structure along the magnetic field line on the disk mid - plane , as shown in  3.2 ( e.g. model c45 ) .",
    "although this bar does not fragment in this study , such a bar structure suggests the possibility of fragmentation in the adiabatic phase ( paper iii ) if the calculation is continued . even if the bar does not fragment in the case of there being no explicit non - axisymmetric perturbations",
    ", we expect bar fragmentation if an initial explicit perturbation is added .",
    "we confirmed that bar fragmentation occurs in model ( c ) when we added a 10% non - axisymmetric density perturbation to the initial state . as a result",
    ", the anisotropy arising from magnetic and centrifugal forces in non - aligned rotator models promotes bar fragmentation and suppresses ring fragmentation .",

    ", these studies assume that the magnetic field lines are initially parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "the evolutions of non - aligned rotator models are almost the same as those of aligned rotator models for support - deficient models , while the evolutions are completely different for support - sufficient models .",
    "for example , the direction of the magnetic field continues to move away from the rotation axis in a rapidly rotating cloud .",
    "the directions of the magnetic field and rotation are completely different after disk formation in this case .",
    "comparing magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the rotation vector shows that a perpendicular magnetic field transfers angular momentum more effectively than a parallel field @xcite . in other words ,",
    "magnetic braking is more effective in non - aligned rotator models than in aligned rotator models .",
    "this strong magnetic braking may be the solution of the angular momentum problem , in which the specific angular momentum of a parent cloud is much larger than that of a new - born star .",
    "the magnetic field strengths and directions have been observed for many clouds .",

    "recently , the directions of the magnetic field have been observed in both large ( cloud ) and small ( prestellar core ) scales in the same target .",
    "the small - scale polarization pattern of the w51 molecular cloud observed by bima ( berkeley - illinois - maryland association ; * ? ? ? * ) coincides with the large - scale polarization pattern observed by scuba @xcite .",
    "also , the directions of the magnetic field were found to be the same in both large- and small - scale observations of the dr21 cloud @xcite .",
    "however , some observations have given contrasting findings .",
    "although the average polarization angle in the mms6 core in the omc-3 region of the orion a cloud @xcite coincides with the large - scale polarization angle observed by scuba @xcite , the polarization angle changes systematically across the core .",
    "an observation of the barnard 1 cloud in perseus reveals that three of the four cores exhibit different mean field directions than that of the ambient cloud @xcite .",
    "these trends of omc-3 and the barnard 1 cloud agree well with the results for non - aligned rotator models in group c in  3.1 .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig:13n ] for model c30 , although the magnetic field maintains its initial direction @xmath312 outside the high - density core , inside the high - density region the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the rotation ( @xmath43- ) axis ( @xmath313 ) .",
    "thus , the direction of the magnetic field varies for different spatial scales . in this model ,",
    "the angle between the large - scale and small - scale magnetic fields is @xmath314 .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic field lines have the same direction in both large- and small - scales in w51 and dr21 .",
    "these clouds correspond to groups a , b , and e , in which the magnetic field hardly changes its direction in the isothermal phase .",
    "these clouds are expected to have a slow rotation rate .",
    "these findings show that the direction of the magnetic field can change only in support - sufficient rotation - dominant clouds .",
    "recently , an hour - glass - shaped magnetic field has been found in a dynamically contracting core around the binary protostellar system ngc 1333 iras 4a @xcite .",
    "two outflows were also observed in this region and associated with each protostar of the protobinary system @xcite .",

    "fragmentation ( or binary formation ) appears only in rotation - dominated clouds ( paper iii ) . in these clouds",
    ", the magnetic field tends to be aligned along the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis , as shown in  3.2.1 , and therefore the direction of the magnetic field in a dense core does not coincide with that of the large - scale field .",
