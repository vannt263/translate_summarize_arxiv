    "the theory of tensor - network states is evolving rapidly into an interdisciplinary field involving condensed matter physics , quantum information theory , renormalization group theory , and even quantum gravity . from its initial proposals",
    "@xcite , through the development of representations and techniques @xcite , it has become increasingly popular in the simulation of both classical models @xcite and strongly correlated quantum systems @xcite , providing deep insight into the physical properties of quantum many - body states . in one dimension , the tensor - network state is known as a matrix - product state ( mps ) @xcite , and is also the wave function generated by the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "a mps may be viewed as a trial wave function arising from virtual entangled pairs formed between two nearest - neighbor sites of a lattice .",
    "thus it yields a local description of quantum many - body states based on their entanglement structure .",
    "a typical example of a mps is the @xmath0 affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state @xcite , which provides a prototype framework for understanding the physics of the haldane excitation gap in integer quantum spin chains .",
    "projected entangled pair states ( peps ) constitute a natural generalization of mps to two and higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this generalization , motivated by two - dimensional aklt states @xcite , is obtained by distributing virtual maximally entangled states between any two nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "it leads to a faithful representation of the many - body wave function of the ground state .",
    "crucially , peps capture the boundary area law obeyed by the entanglement entropy , which is believed to be the most important ingredient causing quantum systems to behave differently from classical ones @xcite .",
    "it is precisely the existence of entanglement that is responsible for such exotic phenomena as quantum phase transitions and topological quantum order .",
    "furthermore , peps allow a many - body ground - state wave function , which contains exponentially many degrees of freedom , to be calculated approximately but accurately on a polynomial time scale . in particular , for a translationally invariant system , the understanding of the whole wave function can be mapped to the problem of studying the properties of just a single , or a small number of , local tensor(s ) .    despite its strengths ,",
    "the peps representation has two significant disadvantages .",
    "it describes correctly the entanglement of adjacent basis states , making it a good representation of aklt - type states , and in principle it can be used to represent all quantum states satisfying the area law of entanglement .",
    "however , in practical calculations , the bond dimension must be kept as small as possible to obtain sufficient accuracy and efficiency , and this means that peps may not always provide a good representation for the quantum states of some systems . as an example , applying the peps algorithm on a triangular lattice is technically difficult due to the high coordination number .",
    "a local tensor in peps on a triangular lattice contains seven indices , six from the virtual bond degrees of freedom and one from the physical degrees of freedom . because the size of each tensor scales as @xmath1 , the bond dimension @xmath2 that can be handled practically by current techniques is limited to a very small value ( approximately 2@xmath35 ) .",
    "the other disadvantage of peps concerns their application to frustrated systems .",
    "they have been used to provide a very good variational ansatz for the ground - state wave function of two - dimensional quantum spin models on the square and honeycomb lattices @xcite . however , for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , we found that the entanglement spectra of the local tensors for each one of the four bonding directions are always doubly degenerate , due to the frustrated lattice geometry , when @xmath4 .",
    "this causes a numerical instability that is difficult to correct in the calculation of expectation values , and in this case the peps ground - state energy does not converge with increasing @xmath2 . more generally , and as we discuss in detail below , it is difficult to use peps to represent a quantum state in which the local correlation or entanglement among all the basis states within a cluster ( or simplex ) containing more than two lattice sites , for example the simplex solid state proposed by arovas @xcite , becomes important .    in this work , we solve these problems by introducing a new class of tensor - network states .",
    "we call these projected entangled simplex states ( pess ) , because they can be understood in terms of entangled simplex states of virtual systems that are locally projected onto the physical basis states . this class of states arises naturally as the exact representation of the simplex solid states , but is of much broader use because , similar to peps , any state can be represented by pess if the virtual dimension is sufficiently large .",
    "pess extend pair correlations to simplex correlations and hence constitute a natural generalization of the peps representation .    by the word `` simplex '' we refer to a cluster of lattice sites , which constitute the basic unit , or `` building block , '' of a two- or higher - dimensional lattice . as an example ,",
    "a triangle is a building block of the kagome lattice ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "can be taken as a simplex for this lattice .",
    "however , one may also combine a number of simplices to form a larger simplex ; the choice of a simplex is not unique , but it should reflect correctly the symmetry of the system . if a simplex contains @xmath5 lattice sites , we refer to the corresponding pess as an @xmath5-pess . if we release the definition of the simplex and allow it to contain just two neighboring sites , @xmath6 , the pess are precisely the peps .",
    "thus pess include peps as a subclass . as for peps , pess",
    "are defined by introducing a number of virtual basis states at each node of the lattice .",
    "in addition to the local tensors , defined similarly to the peps framework for projecting out the physical states from the virtual basis states at each node , the pess contain a new type of local tensor , which we call the `` entangled simplex tensor . ''",
    "this tensor describes the correlation , or entanglement , of virtual particles within the full simplex , and it is this feature that addresses the frustration problem .",
    "an @xmath5-pess with @xmath7 is constructed as a tensor - network product of these two types of local tensor .",
    "examples of this process are presented in sec .",
    "concerning the bond - dimension problem of peps , we provide a brief example using the kagome lattice .",
    "the order ( number of tensor indices ) of the local tensors in a peps representation is five and the size of the local tensor is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dimension of the physical basis states . for pess , as we will illustrate in sec .",
    "ii , both types of local tensors have only three indices , their sizes being @xmath10 for the regular projection tensors and @xmath11 for the entangled simplex tensor .",
    "thus in practical calculations a significantly larger bond dimension may be studied in the pess representation than by peps . while this is a major advantage of pess , it does not mean a pess representation is always more efficient than a peps one .",
    "for aklt states , peps remain the most efficient representation , whereas for simplex solid states , pess are undoubtedly the most efficient .",
    "we close this introduction by noting that general insight into the structure of a quantum wave function may be obtained from singular value decomposition ( svd ) . in the dmrg procedure in one spatial dimension , schmidt decomposition of the wave function",
    "is a svd , and the svd spectrum is simply the square root of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix .",
    "indeed , at the formal level any wave function generated by dmrg can be expressed as a projected `` maximally entangled pair '' state ; in this sense , the peps description is equivalent to a svd and the physical content of a mps or peps ansatz can be understood more generally from the entanglement structure of the wave function under svd .",
    "however , the peps approach offers a means of constructing the wave function using only the local entanglement structure , which greatly simplifies the construction of the pess representation in comparison with a svd approach .",
    "this said , svd @xcite and higher - order svd ( hosvd ) @xcite of tensors is fundamental in constructing renormalization schemes for tensor - network representations of systems in dimensions higher than one , and is the core of the methods employed in sec .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sss ] , in order to elaborate the physics underlying the pess , we introduce an su(2 ) simplex solid state of spin @xmath12 and construct explicitly both its pess representation and the parent hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "[ sec : trialwf ] we propose the pess as a trial wavefuntion for the ground states of quantum lattice models .",
    "we introduce in sec .",
    "iv a simple update approach for evaluating the pess wavefunction based on the hosvd of tensors . by applying this approach to the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , we obtain the ground - state energy as a function of the bond dimension @xmath2 for simplices with @xmath13 , 5 , and 9 .",

    "we stress that our result is variational , hence representing an upper energy bound , and that this bound can clearly be lowered quite significantly by further increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we remind the reader that our method is for a system infinite in size , with truncation effected through @xmath2 , and thus our results set an upper bound for @xmath165 in the infinite two - dimensional limit .",

    "in fact all three pess values for the ground - state energy already lie lower than the energies of the proposed valence - bond - crystal states @xcite , and the best energy obtained by contractor renormalization @xcite , for @xmath168 .",

    "the 3-pess and 9-pess break the symmetry between up and down triangles , while the 5-pess breaks the threefold rotational symmetry of the kagome lattice .",
    "we have studied the energy differences induced in this way , and illustrate their evolution with both trotter step size @xmath66 and mps bond dimension @xmath159 in fig .  [",
    "fig : pess - sb ] for the example of the up - down asymmetry between triangles in the 3-pess .",
    "this calculation also illustrates the nature of the truncation error in the mps calculation of expectation values , where the effects of finite @xmath66 , @xmath2 , and @xmath159 are interdependent .",
    "it is clear that the energy difference tends to zero , restoring the symmetry of the ground - state wave function , as @xmath174 at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath159 .",
    "this difference is in fact a direct measure of the truncation error in the wave function , which is fully controlled by @xmath66 .",
    "the inset indicates that symmetry restoration is also approached in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath159 , where again it is limited by the value of @xmath66 .",
    "thus we can state with confidence that the lattice symmetries are preserved in the true ground state .",
    "we expect that physical quantities calculated from the pess wave function , including single - site magnetizations and single - bond spin correlation functions , will show the same property of weak , symmetry - broken differences tending to a uniform value in the appropriate limits .",
    "we remark again that our ground - state wave function is obtained on the basis of the simple update approximation . by adopting this procedure we have essentially sacrificed a precise accounting for the effects of the bond environment in exchange for the accuracy inherent in accessing larger values of the tensor dimension @xmath2 .",
    "such an approach underestimates the long - range correlation ( entanglement ) of the spins . to improve on this result , and to calculate the correlation functions with the maximum accuracy available within the pess framework",
    ", one should perform a full - update calculation taking complete account of the bond environment .",
    "we leave this generally very time - consuming task for future study .",
    "we have introduced the projected entangled simplex states ( pess ) as a new class of tensor - network states embodying the entanglement of particles within a simplex .",
    "it is an exact tensor - network representation of the simplex solid states first introduced by arovas @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated , using an su(2 ) simplex solid state for @xmath12 spins on the kagome lattice , how to construct the pess wave function and the parent hamiltonian .",
    "the discussion can be generalized to su(n ) or other groups and to all lattice geometries .",
    "pess , together with projected entangled pair states ( peps ) , form a comprehensive representation of tensor - network states that satisfy the area law of entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "they arise naturally in the context of constructing trial wave functions for quantum systems on two- or higher - dimensional lattices . for a wide variety of systems ,",
    "pess provide an efficient representation of the exponential number of coefficients by a small number of parameters describing the low - energy physics of many - body quantum states arising from local interactions . as for peps ,",
    "pess correlation functions are short - ranged , and so results obtained with the pess representation should converge exponentially with increasing bond dimension @xmath2 for sufficiently large @xmath2 in a gapped system . for a translationally invariant system , the pess calculation is performed directly on an infinite lattice , by - passing completely the errors inherent in extrapolations from finite - size calculations .",
    "peps and pess are two types of trial wave function . in systems where the correlation between pairs of neighboring sites are strongest , such as an aklt state",
    ", then peps are appropriate . if correlations among all the basis states in a simplex or a larger cluster become important , then the pess representation is required . from our studies of the spin-1/2 kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet , the failure of peps to converge , contrasted with the success of pess ,",
    "indicate that the effects of frustration in the kagome geometry are well accounted for by the entangled simplex tensor @xmath23 .",
    "an underlying reason for the success of the pess wavefunction on the kagome lattice may be that it is defined on the decorated honeycomb lattice , which is geometrically unfrustrated . these observations suggest that the problem of geometrical frustration in other lattices can be similarly and approximately solved by finding a pess representation whose local tensors form an unfrustrated lattice .",
    "pess are also superior to peps in that the orders of the local tensors are reduced in certain lattices .",
    "a particular example is the triangular lattice , where in the peps representation the total number of tensor elements is @xmath175 , while in a pess representation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sss - triangle ] ) the two tensors contain only @xmath11 and @xmath176 elements .",
    "still , a rigorous evaluation of all local tensors in a pess representation , including the corresponding expectation values , requires a trace over all indices .",
    "this is an exponentially hard problem and one not directly tractable for large lattice systems , but approximate contraction schemes have been devised to overcome this limitation . in the calculation of expectation values , there is little difference between peps and pess ; the methods developed for evaluating expectation values based on peps can be extended straightforwardly to pess .    to determine the pess wave function ,",
    "we have introduced a simple but efficient update approach based on hosvd .",
    "this is basically an entanglement mean - field approach , which leads to a scalable variational method for finding the local tensors .",
    "we have applied this method to the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice and obtained an excellent estimate of the ground - state energy , @xmath177 ( from the 9-pess with @xmath166 ) .",
    "this very promising result can be further improved by enlarging the order and the bond dimension of the local tensors within the simple update scheme , or more rigorously by a full update of the bond environment tensors .",
    "this latter step will allow one to evaluate accurately the correlation functions and the entanglement spectra .",
    "efforts in this direction should help to make a definitive identification of the topological phase in the ground state of the kagome heisenberg model .",
    "the pess representation can be readily extended to other lattices and other models .",
    "it provides a significant advantage in studying the ground - state properties of quantum lattice models on the triangular ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sss - triangle ] ) , square ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sss - square ] ) , and other lattices , because the order of the local tensors on these lattices is much smaller than for the corresponding peps .",
    "in particular , we believe that the pess representation shown in fig .  [ fig : sss - square](b ) offers many advantages over peps for studying the @xmath178@xmath3@xmath179 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the square lattice @xcite . finally , by proceeding as for the development of fermionic peps @xcite , the pess framework can also be extended to include fermionic degrees of freedom .",
