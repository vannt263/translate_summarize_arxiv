    "minos is such an experiment .",
    "denote the usual neutrino survival probability in the two - flavor approximation as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angle describing mixing between the second and third mass states and @xmath2 is the difference in the squares of those mass states .",
    "the energy of the neutrino is @xmath3 and the distance it travels is @xmath4 .",
    "then lv and cptv that would cause lepton - number violating mixing between neutrinos and antineutrinos introduces an additional perturbation term to the survival probability  @xcite , @xmath5 where the perturbation term @xmath6 can be written  @xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8  km is the distance from neutrino production in the numi beam to the minos fd  @xcite , @xmath9 is the earth s sidereal frequency , and @xmath10 is the local sidereal arrival time of the neutrino event .",
    "eq.([eq : osc ] ) shows that harmonic variations at the sidereal frequency are visible up to @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 parameters contain the lv and cptv information on neutrino - antineutrino mixing .",
    "they depend on the sme coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the neutrino energy , and the direction of the neutrino propagation in a coordinate system fixed on the rotating earth  @xcite .",
    "a more complete description of this work can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses a data set of neutrino interactions acquired by minos from may , 2005 through april , 2012 .",
    "the interactions were selected using standard minos criteria for beam and data quality  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the events were required to interact within the 4.2  kiloton fd fiducial volume .",
    "this selection enables minos to establish each event as a cc @xmath15 interaction by identifying the outgoing @xmath16 .",
    "we focused on cc events to maximize the @xmath15 disappearance signal .",

    "[ table : datapower ]    in rebel and mufson  @xcite we determine the statistical significance of the harmonic powers in table  [ table : datapower ] by simulation .",
    "we find that 3.45 is the 99.7% confidence level ( c.l . ) for the probability that a measured quadratic sum of powers for any harmonic was _ not _ drawn from a distribution having a sidereal signal . since none of the harmonic powers exceed our 99.7%(fft ) detection threshold , we conclude that there is no evidence for a sidereal modulation resulting from mixing between neutrinos and antineutrinos as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc ] ) in this neutrino data set .",
    "we investigated the sensitivity of our results to several sources of systematic uncertainties .",
    "we found that systematics were unimportant .",
    "we determined the confidence limits for the sme coefficients by methods we developed in our previous papers  @xcite . in these limit calculations the odd harmonics in eq.([eq : osc ] ) vanish . since we set all but one coefficient to zero in computing the limits and the odd harmonics involve products of different sme coefficients , they disappear from eq.([eq : osc ] ) .",
    "we start by simulating a set of experiments in which there is no sidereal modulation .",
    "each of the simulated experiments contain the same number of interactions as the data set .",
    "we then introduce an infinitesimal lv sidereal signal into the experiments with the one nonzero sme coefficient .",
    "we then generate the sidereal phase diagrams for these experiments and test whether there is an lv signal detectable in the phase diagrams with the same fft analysis used to analyze the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_rate ] .    in our simulation , neutrinos are generated by modeling the numi beam line , including hadron production by the 120 gev@xmath21 protons striking the target and the propagation of the hadrons through the focusing elements and decay pipe to the beam absorber .",
    "the simulation then calculates the probability that any neutrinos generated traverse the fd .",
    "the fd neutrino event simulation takes the neutrinos from the numi simulation , along with weights determined by decay kinematics , and uses this information as input into the simulation of the interactions in the fd .",
    "we inject a sidereal signal in the simulation by calculating the survival probability for each simulated neutrino based on the even harmonics in eq .",
