    "the disk of the milky way is warped like an integral sign , rising above the plane on one side and falling below the plane on the other .",
    "this warp is seen both in maps of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the stellar distribution ( reed 1996 ; drimmel , smart , & lattanzi 2000 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "the sun lies along the line of nodes of the warp , where tilted outer rings cross the inner plane ( see figure  [ schematic ] ) .    despite their tendency to disperse when isolated @xcite , warps are common in external galaxies ( bosma 1981 ; briggs 1990 ; christodoulou , tohline , & steiman - cameron 1993 ; reshetnikov & combes 1998 )",
    "this has driven many authors to search for universal mechanisms to excite or maintain warps ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "many of these proposed mechanisms rely on the dark halo to either stabilize warps as discrete bending modes within the halo ( sparke & casertano 1988 ; but see also binney , jiang , & dutta 1998 ) , or to provide the torque necessary to create the warp @xcite .",
    "other proposed mechanisms include the infall of intergalactic gas ( lpez - corredoira , betancort - rijo , & beckman 2002a ) , magnetic fields ( battaner , florido , & sanchez - saavedra 1990 ) , and interactions with satellite galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of these mechanisms can , in particular circumstances , produce realistic - looking galactic warps .",
    "although no single mechanism appears universal enough to account for all warps , the evolution toward a bending mode ( even when no discrete mode exists ) appears enough like an observed warp @xcite that warping may be a generic response of disks to the individual perturbations they experience . in this case",
    ", we should look at individual warped galaxies for specific evidence of particular perturbations that explain their warps rather than search for a universal mechanism that may not exist .",
    "the magellanic clouds have been proposed as the perturbation responsible for the milky way s warp .",
    "while @xcite found that the tidal distortion from the clouds alone is not sufficient to cause the observed warp , @xcite proposed that orbiting satellites could set up wakes in the milky way s halo which could provide the necessary torque .",
    "@xcite performed self - consistent simulations of such a system and confirmed that for a sufficiently massive halo ( @xmath3 ) , the magnitude of the torque can be increased enough to cause a warp of the same magnitude as the milky way s .",
    "the magellanic clouds orbit about the center of the galaxy in a direction orthogonal to the line of nodes , i.e. , near the line of maximum warp ( see figure  [ schematic ] ) .",
    "garca - ruiz , kuijken , & dubinski ( 2000 ) demonstrated that the warp caused by a satellite will have its line of nodes oriented _ along _ the satellite s orbit",
    ". a simple way of understanding this result is to recognize that a torque is a transfer of angular momentum , and therefore the disk will acquire angular momentum along the same axis as the orbital angular momentum of the satellite which is providing the torque , and tilt toward that axis .",
    "therefore , the magellanic clouds are a bad candidate for producing the milky way warp .",
    "the orbital plane of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1994 ) does intersect the line of nodes , suggesting that it may be a good candidate for producing the milky way warp @xcite .",
    "it is located behind the galactic bulge and is on a nearly polar orbit @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed simulations which suggest that the passage of a sufficiently massive sgr ( @xmath4 ) through the disk could produce a warp .",
    "alternatively , its gravitational tides or the tides of a wake it produces in the dark halo could exert a warp - inducing torque on the disk .",
    "if sgr is responsible for the warp , its angular momentum will be coupled to that of the warp . in this letter ,",
    "i calculate the orbital angular momentum of sgr , along with the component of the milky way disk s angular momentum which does not lie in the common plane .",
    "i show that they have the same direction and the same magnitude .",
    "as there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect them to be within orders of magnitude of each other , this is evidence that sgr is coupled to the warp , and therefore responsible for it .",

    "the angular momentum can range between 1.7  and @xmath10 and is directed toward @xmath11 , @xmath1 .",
    "the major uncertainty in this calculation is the determination of the mass .",
    "@xcite argued that in order for the satellite to have survived to the present day , it must have a massive extended dark matter halo and a total @xmath12 in solar units @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found viable models with more moderate masses ranging from @xmath13 for a purely stellar model to @xmath14 for their model with an extended dark matter envelope ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "their models 14 , which differ primarily in disk scale length , @xmath42 , are all acceptable fits to the observations , and therefore provide a reasonable range of mass distributions with which to estimate the angular momentum .",

    "also fit an @xmath58 mode , but the net angular momentum of any even @xmath59 mode is aligned with the angular momentum of the flat disk , so it will not contribute .",
    "i use equation  ( [ drimmal h(r ) ] ) for the stellar disk and equation  ( [ bm h(r ) ] ) for the gas disk .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ disk table ] .",
    "the majority of the angular momentum is contained in the range @xmath60  kpc in all models .",
    "the sun lies within @xmath61 of the line of nodes , so @xmath62 is directed toward @xmath63 , @xmath1 .",
    "table  [ satellites table ] shows the magnitude and direction of the angular momentum of the milky way warp and of the galactic satellites with measured proper motions .",
    "both the magnitude and direction of the angular momentum of sagittarius are strikingly similar to that of the milky way warp .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect this ; the angular momenta of the other satellites with known orbits span three orders of magnitude and almost @xmath64 of galactic longitude ( although there is a strong tendency for the satellites to have polar orbits with low values of @xmath65 , as suggested by @xcite and noted in the anisotropic distribution about the milky way by @xcite ) .",
    "the coincidence of the two angular momentum vectors is probable evidence that they are dynamically coupled , i.e. , that sagittarius is the perturber responsible for the galactic warp .",
    "there are three possibilities for the nature of the coupling .",
    "the first is a direct gravitational tidal torque by the satellite itself @xcite , the second is the gravitational torque of a wake in the galactic dark matter halo @xcite , and the third is an impulsive deposition of momentum to the gas disk by passage through it @xcite .",
    "the direct tidal torque for a satellite of mass @xmath59 and distance @xmath66 scales as @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the direct tidal effect of sgr is no stronger than that of the lmc , whose direct tidal torque is not sufficient to induce the warp @xcite .",
    "this means that the gravitational torque of sgr itself can not be the coupling mechanism .    if the primary perturber is instead a wake in the halo , the strength of the torque scales as @xmath68 .",
    "the mass of the wake scales as the mass of the satellite and as the density of the halo at the wake radius @xcite .",
    "the wake develops at half the satellite s orbital radius @xcite .",
    "therefore , for an isothermal halo , the strength of the torque scales as @xmath69 . in this case , the effect of sagittarius is 1050 times stronger than that of the lmc .",
    "it is plausible that in @xcite s lower mass simulation , in which the lmc did not excite a warp , a satellite with sagittarius s parameters would have .",
    "further simulations which better reproduce the observed sgr - mw system could confirm or falsify this suggestion .",
    "@xcite suggest that the impulsive deposition of momentum to the gas disk could excite the warp .",
    "the mass they use for sgr , @xmath4 , is quite large , and they find very little warping in their @xmath70 simulation .",
    "however , they only model a single interaction .",
    "in order for the angular momenta to reach an equilibrium , as they appear to have done , there must be repeated or continual encounters .",
    "@xcite find orbital periods of @xmath71  gyr for sagittarius , indicating that it has passed through the disk several times .",
    "further simulations that follow the evolution of the system over many encounters are necessary to better understand the predictions of this model ; meanwhile , it can not be ruled out .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the component of the milky way disk angular momentum due to the galactic warp are both directed toward @xmath0 , @xmath1 with magnitude 2@xmath2 .",
    "such a coincidence suggests that they are a coupled system , i.e. , that sgr is responsible for the warp .",
    "the direct gravitational tidal torque of sgr can not cause the warp .",
    "interaction via a gravitational wake in the milky way s dark matter halo , and impulsive deposition of momentum into the disk by passing through it are still both possible coupling mechanisms .",
    "more simulations of each of these models are necessary to discriminate between their effects .",
