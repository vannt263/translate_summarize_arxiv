    "thus , a change in @xmath81 by @xmath86 ntu @xmath87 years causes that @xmath67 goes up by the factor @xmath88  enough for the observed radiation to drift from the gamma - range into the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "the 49 years is not a sufficiently short time to account for the abrupt end of a grb quantitatively , but the qualitative effect of afterglow is here , and thereby is qualitatively accounted for .",
    "but the abrupt beginning and end of a grb and the afterglow should rather be associated with the center of the radiation source going into and off the line of sight than with the passage of time at the observer ( see sec .",
    "[ ltnullgeo ] ) .",
    "the model predicts a discontinuous jump from redshift to blueshift and back to redshift for an arbitrarily small change in the direction of observation ( which qualitatively accounts for ) .",
    "in reality such a change might be provided , for example , by the orbital motion of the earth .",
    "then , the blueshifted ray would stay within the observer s field of view only briefly , and this would implicitly account for .    if the center of the bb hump would stay in the observer s line of sight all the time , then she would see the gamma radiation persisting for nearly the whole @xmath89 years .",

    "the model of fig .",
    "[ drawtrueray ] can not explain the highest - frequency end of the grb spectrum @xcite by means of blueshifting from the hydrogen emission range .",
    "this does not yet imply that the high - frequency grbs must arise by a different mechanism : it is still an open question whether a finer - tuned l  t model could do the job .",
    "a cosmological model that would account for the multitude of observed grbs should be imagined as a friedmann background containing many humps like the one in fig .",
    "[ drawfarkantray ] , of different shapes , different spatial extents and different heights above the flat part of @xmath0 , placed at different comoving positions .",
    "redshift is used in astronomy as the measure of distance .",
    "but blueshifting renders redshift  distance relations multivalued @xcite .",
    "no operational method of determining the distance is known when blueshifts are present . the distance from the observer to the source of the ray in fig .",
    "[ drawtrueray ] can be estimated in two ways :    \\1 .",
    "the intersection of the ray with the lsh occurs @xmath90 years ago , so by conventional accounting the source would be @xmath91 light years from the observer .",
    "this is @xmath92 years later than the bb of the @xmath51cdm model , whose present age is @xcite @xmath93    \\2 .",
    "the sum of the values of the @xmath21-coordinate of the observer ( @xmath94 ) and of the intersection of the ray with the lsh ( @xmath95 ) is @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath97 determines the active gravitational mass contained within the @xmath98 sphere centered at the observer by @xmath99 . in the @xmath51cdm model , the same @xmath97 ( corresponding to the same mass )",
    "is reached by the present observer s past light cone at @xmath100 ntu , i.e. @xmath101 years ago , which implies the distance @xmath101 light years .",
    "this number is within the range of distances inferred from observations of the grbs @xcite , and thereby is accounted for .    the most obvious possibility to improve the model is to manipulate the shape and size of the bb hump seen in fig .",
    "[ drawtrueray ] , for example , by putting more parameters into it .",
    "this may result in the rays staying before the mrh for a longer segment of the affine parameter , and thus in smaller observed values of @xmath67 .",
    "the second possibility is to model the bb hump by the szekeres metric @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it contains the l  t model as a subcase , but in general has no symmetry .",
    "therefore , it must be verified what directions in the szekeres class of metrics go over into the l ",
    "t radial directions , and whether blueshifts appear on them .",
    "a szekeres model might produce a different time - profile of the observed frequency , and a better quantitative agreement with the observed properties of the grbs .",
    "the model proposed here deals satisfactorily with the low end of the grb frequency range ( property ( 1 ) in sec .",

    "the only property not explicitly accounted for is ( 2 ) . in order to account for it ,",
    "one should calculate the change of observed frequency induced by a small change in the direction of observation .",
    "this is possible to do in the present model , but requires numerical calculations of a much higher precision .    using a bb profile with more parameters , and modelling the bb hump using a szekeres rather than the l ",
    "t metric may lead to a full quantitative agreement between the model and the observations .",
