    "here , we instead use general symmetry arguments to determine the most general possible action near the critical point , and hence describe the universal properties of the phase transition .",

    "order transition is to be expected for the ising , anisotropic xy and heisenberg model independent of the external conditions . in view of this earlier work it seems likely that also the above model will exhibit a topology of the flow diagram which is similar to the magnetic models and which is commonly interpreted as a signature of a fluctuation driven first",
    " order phase transition .",
    "as we will see from the calculations in sections [ sf_coll_transition][dim_reg ] this is actually the case .",
    "however , as will also be discussed in the following sections , this conclusion has to be reached with some care .",
    "near the transition point , the development of the ordered phase is reflected by the scaling behavior of the structure function .",
    "we define an euclidean density  density correlation function @xmath65 where the subscript @xmath66 denotes the cumulant expectation value ( connected greens function ) .",
    "substitution of eq.([opdefs ] )  exposes the connection to the order parameters in position space : @xmath67 where non  singular smooth contributions have been dropped .",
    "scaling theory gives the form of these connected correlations in the critical regime , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the correlation lengths for the ordering transitions of the @xmath29 and @xmath32 fields , respectively , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) are the dynamical scaling and anomalous dimension exponents , and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) are universal scaling functions ( the @xmath77 signs indicate whether the system is above or below the critical point ) .",

    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 is a unit vector in the @xmath85 direction , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 are scaling functions .",
    "the full dynamical structure factor also has a scaling form , @xmath88     \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\;\\ ; + \\sum_{ij }     \\tilde{\\xi}^{2-\\tilde{\\eta}}\\tilde{h}_{\\pm , ij}[(\\bbox{q } -     \\pi\\hat{\\bbox{e}}_i)\\tilde{\\xi},\\omega\\tilde{\\xi}^{\\tilde{z } } ] , \\label{euclidean_sf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath89 and @xmath90 are scaling functions ( simple relations exist between @xmath91,@xmath92 and @xmath89 , and may be easily derived by fourier transformation of eqs.([scalingeqns])([euclidean_sf ] ) ) .",
    "somewhat simpler results are obtained in the isotropic , ballistic limit , when @xmath21 and @xmath93 .",
    "focusing on the behavior near @xmath94 , the dynamic structure function then takes the form @xmath95.\\ ] ] a similar form holds near @xmath96 . at small arguments ,",
    "we expect @xmath92 to become approximately lorentzian .",

    "this implies the behavior @xmath104 , \\label{retarded_function}\\ ] ] and thus a continuum of modes with linear dispersion .",
    "in addition to these quantities , the critical fluctuations of the checkerboard order parameter modify the behavior of the superfluid . to study these modifications , it is useful to define the current  current correlation function @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the super - current . by introducing an infinitesimal generating field into eqs.([critical_action])([ptcoupling ] )  and differentiating the final effective action twice , one easily obtains the expression @xmath107 \\label{d_formula}\\ ] ] for @xmath108 in the phonon representation .",
    "the superfluid density @xmath109 and second - sound velocity @xmath110 may be extracted from the long wavelength form @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "eq.([critical_action ] )  exhibits four phases in mean - field theory . in the superfluid ( sf )",

    "we have been unable to determine the detailed geometry of the mean  field phase diagram .",
    "however , we expect the general topology shown in fig.[mf_phase_diagram_fig ] . for large @xmath7 and @xmath119 , there is a critical line separating the sf and c phases , while for large @xmath35 and @xmath120 , a different phase boundary separates the sf and x states .",
    "for large @xmath7 , the checkerboard order parameter @xmath29 is strongly suppressed and plays no role in the sf - c transition .",
    "we therefore consider here eq.([critical_action ] )  with @xmath113 and thereby neglect @xmath121 ( indeed , integrating out the massive @xmath29 field leads only to a small renormalization of @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) . for concreteness",
    ", we now also focus directly on the case @xmath1 , in which @xmath32 is a two - component field .    in the absence of coupling to the superfluid phase mode ( i.e. @xmath124 ) , the action is identical to the classical free energy of an xy ferromagnet with cubic ( square ) anisotropy @xmath123 in @xmath125 dimensions . for positive @xmath123 ( as assumed here ) , the collinear state is favored for @xmath126 in mean - field theory . to study the critical properties for @xmath127 , however , we must include the effects of fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations have been studied ( with @xmath124 ) by many authors @xcite .",
    "there is a general agreement between epsilon expansion and direct rg calculations as well as experimental observations  @xcite that cubic anisotropy is in fact an _ irrelevant _ perturbation on the xy fixed point in three dimensions , with rg eigenvalue @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the sf - c transition with @xmath124 should be xy - like , i.e. @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath123 is in fact a _ dangerous _ irrelevant operator , because it is necessary to select the direction of @xmath32 in the ordered phase@xcite .",
    "this asymptotic restoration of the @xmath45 symmetry should lead to the emergence of a `` pseudo - goldstone '' mode near the critical point in the ordered phase . to see this , consider following the rg flows ( for @xmath132 ) until the renormalized reduced temperature is of order one . at this point",
    ", the rescaled @xmath32 will have amplitude of order one ( enforced by the negative @xmath133 and positive @xmath134 terms ) , but almost unconstrained angle @xmath135 .",
    "the renormalized action for @xmath136 is then of the form @xmath137 \\nonumber \\\\               & &               -v ' \\tilde{\\xi}^{\\lambda_4 } \\left[\\cos^4\\theta +               \\sin^4\\theta\\right ]               \\bigg\\}.   \\label{theta_action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding the cosine and sine terms in @xmath136 gives the dispersion @xmath138 , with the anomalously small gap @xmath139 .",
    "note that the longitudinal gap @xmath140 is much larger than @xmath141 .",
    "the system appears isotropic in the sense that @xmath142 as @xmath143 .",
    "a detailed study of the effect of cubic anisotropy on the critical behavior below @xmath144 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    until now we have neglected the interaction with the phase @xmath38 .",
    "remarkably , the xy fixed point is stable against these fluctuations . as described in detail in ref .",
    ", the relevance of @xmath145 at the `` classical '' critical point is determined by the specific heat exponent @xmath146 .",
    "in particular , the eigenvalue @xmath147 is slightly negative at the three dimensional xy fixed point , and the long wavelength physics at the critical point is just that of a decoupled @xmath127 xy critical point and a free massless boson ( phase ) field .    another way to understand this result is to integrate out the density fluctuations @xmath32 and determine their effect upon the superfluid modes .",
    "this is easily accomplished perturbatively in @xmath148 , since the coupling is precisely to the energy operator @xmath133 . at order @xmath148 ,",
    "one produces only a boundary ( @xmath149 ) contribution .",
    "the first non - trivial term occurs at @xmath150 , where one finds a contribution to the effective action @xmath151 \\nonumber \\\\      & \\sim &      { \\sigma'}^2 \\tilde{\\xi}^{\\tilde{\\alpha}/\\tilde{\\nu } }      \\int_{\\bbox{x},\\tau } |\\partial_\\tau\\theta|^2 , \\label{velocity_correction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath152 are introduced as a shorthand notation for the integration variables @xmath153 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 is a ( short - range ) scaling function describing the energy  energy correlations , and the last line is obtained via a gradient expansion of @xmath156 .",
    "the final correction term may be interpreted as a renormalization of the second sound velocity , @xmath157 where @xmath66 is an order one constant .",
    "note that for @xmath158 , as is the case here , this is a small reduction to the velocity near the critical point . for @xmath159 , however , the correction diverges , and the @xmath123 appears to be driven to zero ! this will be the case for the sf - x transition discussed in the next section and requires a more careful analysis .",
    "here we simply point out that the second sound velocity undergoes a finite _ suppression _ by critical fluctuations ( note that , once @xmath160 is negative , non - singular contributions actually dominate over the singular one exhibited explicitly in eq.([velocity_renormalization ] ) , and lead to a finite correction to @xmath161 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the situation when @xmath162 , but @xmath7 passes through zero . in this case",
    "it is the @xmath32 modes which are weakly fluctuating , and the resulting theory is simply that of the @xmath29 field coupled to the superfluid phase . here",
    "the critical behavior for @xmath163 is simply that of a classical three - dimensional ising model .",
    "however , because the specific heat exponent in this case is positive ( @xmath164 ) , these phase fluctuations are _ relevant _ , and the problem needs to be reconsidered .    to do so , we employ the technique of @xmath22expansion , developing rg equations near the upper critical dimension @xmath165 . in this section ,",
    "we proceed with the simplest such method , known as a momentum - shell rg , which is sufficient to extract most aspects of the critical behavior . in section [ dim_reg ] ,",
    "we use more powerful field theoretic methods within dimensional regularization to compute full crossover quantities . here",
    "the theory is regularized by including a sharp cut - off in momenta : all the functional integrals in the partition function @xmath166 are only over fields with momenta @xmath167 , the cut - off wavevector .",
    "such a cut - off serves as a crude approximation to the physical lattice cut - off of the bosonic system , but the precise form is irrelevant for the perturbative rg to the order required here , and facilitates the calculation of certain quantities .",
    "the momentum shell rg is performed by successive elimination of shells of momenta near the cut - off @xmath168 .",
    "after each shell is integrated out of the partition function , the coordinates and momenta are rescaled to keep the value of the cut - off fixed .",
    "additional rescalings of the fields allows most of the quadratic part of the action to remain fixed as well .",
    "the remaining coefficients _ flow _ under the rg .",
    "while an infinite number of operators are generated , only the relevant ( and marginal ) ones need be kept within the @xmath22 expansion , in this case @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath42 .",
    "momentum shell rg suffers , unfortunately , from one flaw : it is unable to deal properly with situations in which loop integrals must be handled at non  zero external momenta ( and frequencies ) .",
    "for most problems , such momentum and frequency dependence can indeed be neglected to @xmath171 in the rg . in a cubic theory such as this one ,",
    "however , the second diagram in fig .  [ gamma_02 ]  can potentially produce corrections at @xmath171 , because the coupling @xmath170 is only @xmath172 .",
    "we investigate this diagram in appendix [ loop_appendix ] , and find that these dangerous contributions are actually not present .",
    "the momentum shell rg is therefore well defined to leading order in @xmath22 , and we proceed here with the remainder of the calculation .",
    "we define the mode elimination step of the rg by integrating out fields with momenta in the range @xmath173 , and use the critical dynamics method of integrating out _ all _ frequencies , which are not cut off . by choosing @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is infinitesimal , we arrive at differential rg flow equations for the coupling constants .",
    "these equations are easily computed diagrammatically . because we evaluate all loops at zero external momenta ( c.f .",
    "the previous paragraph ) , the constraint that _ both _ loop momenta be within the shell is trivially satisfied by constraining just the single integration variable , due to momentum conservation .    consider first the diagram in fig .",
    "[ gamma_20 ] .",
    "because of the explicit imaginary time derivative in the coupling @xmath170 , this diagram generates a renormalization of the velocity @xmath42 . because of the explicit factor of @xmath47 in the vertex , it decreases @xmath42 as in the perturbative treatment of the previous section . because this is the _ only _ renormalization of @xmath42 at one loop , the search for possible critical fixed points must proceed _ in the limit @xmath176_. this simplifies the computation of certain diagrams .",
    "in particular , any internal @xmath38 lines may be treated in this limit as simply constant @xmath177 factors .",
