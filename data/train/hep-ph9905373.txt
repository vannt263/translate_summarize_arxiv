    "there is a great deal of interest in the accurate determination of the running fine structure constant @xmath0 at the scale of the @xmath1 mass  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is of paramount importance for all precision tests of the standard model .",
    "furthermore , an accurate knowledge of @xmath2 is instrumental in narrowing down the the mass window for the last missing particle of the standard model , the higgs particle .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the determination of @xmath2 is the hadronic contribution to the @xmath3 annihilations needed for this evaluation .",
    "the necessary dispersion integral that enters this calculation has in the past been evaluated by using experimental @xmath3 annihilation data .",
    "discrepancies in the experimental data between different experiments suggest large systematic uncertainties in each of the experiments . in order to reduce the influence of the systematic uncertainties on the determination of @xmath2 one may attempt to add some theoretical input to the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "m.  davier and a.  hcker  @xcite use qcd perturbation theory in form of local duality ( explained later on ) in the region above @xmath4 for the light flavours , while j.h .",
    "khn and m.  steinhauser  @xcite use perturbative results for energy regions outside the charm and bottom threshold regions .",
    "our approach  @xcite is quite different .",
    "we attempt to minimize the influence of data in the dispersion integral over the whole energy region including the threshold regions .      for the @xmath3 annihilation process",
    "there is a main connection between the spectral density @xmath5 and the two - point correlator @xmath6 given in kind of the dispersion relation @xmath7 which implies the reverse relation @xmath8 where the discontinuity is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the production threshold of the light flavours .",
    "these relations can be a chain between the theory , i.e.  the two - point correlator function within perturbative qcd on the one hand and the experiment , i.e.  the spectral density or , equivalently , the total cross section on the other hand .",
    "but there is one obstacle in using these relations : as depending on methods of functional analysis , the inverse of the dispersion relation is only valid if there are no poles encircled by the path in the complex plane , a condition which is necessary to obtain this relation .",
    "these poles can have their origin from weight functions in combination with the spectral density .",
    "this means that if there is such a weight function included in the integration of the spectral density , the inverse relation shown above is only valid _ locally _ and not _",
    "globally_. we call this _ local _ resp .  _",
    "global duality_.      the hadronic contribution to @xmath2 which we are concentrating on is given by the integral  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total @xmath3 hadronic cross section and @xmath13 is the weight function @xmath14 the hadronic cross section is related to the spectral density by @xmath15 but we see : the weight function @xmath13 is indeed singular at the points @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the real axis .",
    "so global duality is not valid any more .",
    "the two - point correlator is given by @xmath18 where we only included the isospin contribution @xmath19 , in contrast to corresponding considerations for the @xmath20 decay .",
    "the scalar correlator function @xmath6 consists of perturbative and non - perturbative contributions which we include to the extend we need them to keep the accuracy . for the perturbative contribution to the correlator",
    "we use a result given in ref .",
    "i only write down the first few terms , @xmath21\\ ] ] with @xmath22 while in ref .",
    "@xcite the expression is given up to @xmath23 .",
    "the number of active flavours is denoted by @xmath24 . for the zeroth order term in the @xmath25 expansion we have added higher order terms in @xmath26 , @xmath27\\ ] ] with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we have denoted the yet unknown constant term in the four - loop contribution by @xmath31 .",
    "remark , however , that the constant non - logarithmic terms will not contribute to our calculations .",
    "the non - perturbative contributions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath32 where we have included the @xmath33-contribution arising from the unit operator . in this expression",
    "we used the @xmath34 colour factors @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . for the coupling constant @xmath26 as well as for the running quark mass we use four - loop expression given in refs .",
    "@xcite even though in both cases the three - loop accuracy would already have been sufficient for the present application .",
    "our method is based on the fact that we can use global duality when the weight function is non - singular .",
    "this is the case for a polynomial function .",
    "so we mimic the weight function by a polynomial function obeying different conditions which we will explain later . by adding and subtracting this polynomial function @xmath38 of given order @xmath39 to the weight function @xmath13",
    ", we obtain without any restrictions @xmath40 where @xmath41 $ ] is any interval out of the total integration range .",
    "but because the second term has now a polynomial weight , we can use global duality to write @xmath42 thus this part can be represented by a difference of two circle integrals in the complex plane . on the other hand , the difference @xmath43 suppresses the contribution of the first part .",
    "our method consists thus of the following steps :    * replacing @xmath5 in the first part of eq .",
    "( [ groote : splitting ] ) by the value of the experimentally measured total cross section @xmath12 ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) * replacing the circle integral contribution to flavours at their threshold by zero * in all other cases inserting the qcd perturbative and non - perturbative parts of @xmath44 on the circle    these replacements can be seen as a concept within qcd sum rules . to obtain the best efficience of our method",
    ", we have to restrict the polynomial function by the following contraints :    * the method of least squares should be used to mimic the weight * however , the degree @xmath39 should not be higher than the order of the highest perturbative resp .",
    "non - perturbative contribution increased by one ( this is a consequence of the cauchy s theorem which is involved in the analytical integration of the circle integrals ) * especially for the low energy region , the polynomial function should vanish on the real axis to avoid instanton effects * in regions where resonances occur , the polynomial function should fit the weight function to suppress those contributions which constitute the highest uncertainty of the experimental data    as just mentioned , the integration on the circle can be done analytically by using the cauchy s theorem .",
    "but we have to keep in mind that the result for @xmath44 we use here depends logarithmically on the renormalization scale @xmath45 and on the parameters of the theory that are renormalized at the scale @xmath45 .",
    "these are the strong coupling constant , the quark masses and the condensates .",
    "as advocated in  @xcite , we implement the renormalization group improvement for the moments of the electromagnetic correlator by performing the integrations over the circle with radius @xmath46 with constant parameters , i.e.  they are renormalized at a fixed scale @xmath45 .",
    "subsequently these parameters are evolved from this scale to @xmath47 using the four - loop @xmath48 function . in other words , we impose the renormalization group equation on the moments rather than on the correlator itself .",
    "this procedure is not only technically simpler but also avoids possible inconsistencies inherent to the usual approach where one applies the renormalization group to the correlator , expands in powers of @xmath49 and carries out the integration in the complex plane only at the end . in the present case",
    "the reference scale is given by @xmath50 .",
    "as a first interval we select the range from the light flavour production threshold @xmath10 and the next threshold marked by the mass of the @xmath51 , @xmath52 . in this case we set the inner circle integral to zero and obtain @xmath53 as mentioned above , we impose the constraints to the polynomial function that it should vanish on the real axis at @xmath54 and should coincide with the weight function at the @xmath55 resonance , i.e.  for @xmath56 .",
    "[ groote : fig1 ] shows polynomials of different order in comparison with the weight function .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ groote : fig2 ] are compared with the result obtained by using only the experimental data . for the up and down quarks",
    "we only keep the mass independent part of the qcd contribution while for the strange quark we include also the terms to order @xmath57 .",
    "the second interval is limited by @xmath58 and the threshold marked by the mass of the @xmath59 , @xmath60 . for the charm quark , we again set the inner circle integral to zero , but for the lighter quarks we have to keep both . the perturbative series for the charm quark is used up to it s known extend .    the third interval given between @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "is again subdivided into two pieces because of it s length .",
    "for the first of these two intervals we choose @xmath63 $ ] , for the second @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "now the bottom quark is the one for which the `` threshold rule '' ( i.e.  leaving out the inner circle ) applies .",
    "the remaining part of the integral starting from @xmath65 up to infinity is done using local duality , i.e.by inserting the function @xmath12 obtained for perturbative qcd into the second part of eq .",
    "( [ groote : splitting ] ) .",
    "our results are collected in table  [ groote : tab1 ] . to obtain these results , we used the condensate values @xmath66 for the errors coming from the uncertainty of the qcd scale we take @xmath67 the errors resulting from the uncertainty in the qcd scale in different energy intervals are clearly correlated and will have to be added linearly in the end .",
    "we also include the error of the strange quark mass in the light quark region which is taken as @xmath68 for the charm and bottom quark masses we use the values @xmath69 summing up the contributions from the five flavours @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , our result for the hadronic contribution to the dispersion integral including the systematic error due to the dependence on @xmath50 ( column  5 in table  [ groote : tab1 ] ) reads @xmath75 in order to obtain the total result for @xmath2 , we have to add the lepton and top contributions . since we have nothing new to add to the calculation of these contributions we simply take the values from ref .",
