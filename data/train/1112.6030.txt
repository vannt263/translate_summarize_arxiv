    "quasars , the brightest extragalactic objects , play an important role in study of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "one of important characteristics of matter spatial inhomogeneity , that may be compared to cosmological theories of structure formation , is the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ; e.g. @xcite ) of quasars , @xmath9 .",
    "the main results on quasars clustering at @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) were obtained using the 2-degree field ( 2df ) quasar survey ( 2qz ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the second stage of which has been completed with the 7th release @xcite .",
    "the first results on quasar clustering for more complete sample of quasars with @xmath11 @xcite appeared recently by virtue of the 9th data release of the sdss @xcite which comprises the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) .",
    "the study of the matter distribution with the help of extragalactic redshift surveys faces two main problems .",
    "firstly , galaxy and quasar surveys give us information only about the distribution of luminous matter which is biased relative to dark matter @xcite .",
    "this bias is expected to be non - linear , scale - dependent and stochastic @xcite , but the simplest , linear , scale - independent bias parameter , which relates the 2pcfs of the dark+luminous matter , @xmath12 , and that of the luminous matter , e.g. quasars , @xmath9 , as @xmath13 has proved to be an extremely useful first order approximation @xcite .",
    "this parameter depends on the nature of extragalactic objects , i.e. , on morphological type @xcite , star formation rate @xcite , color - index @xcite , or the luminosity @xcite .",
    "the latter dependence is explained within the framework of the hierarchical model of the structure formation , in which more massive , and therefore more luminous galaxies , have to reside in more massive dark matter halos , and thus to be more clustered .",
    "it is unclear however whether this relation can be applied to quasar clustering , because of obviously more complicated process of the quasar formation , which in its turn still does not have a concordance model .",
    "several models of quasar formation were presented in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) and based on study of the luminosity dependence of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) clustering , some of them were completely ruled out , while some models are partially supported by observations so far . hence study of the luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering in different wavelength bands can help to clarify not only the relation between the luminous and dark matter clustering , but also the physics of the quasar formation .",
    "it was also shown by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the linear bias parameter of quasars evolves with redshift .",
    "secondly , analysis of the distribution of extragalactic objects is related to the observed redshifts of these objects .",
    "these redshifts are the only tool for measuring distance between the objects on cosmological scales , but they are ` contaminated ' by measurement errors and non - hubble motions .",
    "it results in the so called redshift - space distortions , namely @xcite and ` finger of god ' effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    to avoid the problem of the redshift - space distortion the projected , spatial @xmath14 and angular @xmath15 ,",
    "2pcf are usually used . in the first case the projections @xmath16 of the 3-dimensional distances @xmath17 on the plane",
    "perpendicular to the line of sight are used , and the parameters of the 3-dimensional 2pcf @xmath9 can be reconstructed from the parameters of @xmath14 . here the assumption , that the influence of the redshift inexactness causes a negligible effect on @xmath16 compared to @xmath17 , is usually made . in the second case only the angular distances on the sky plane are used , and the parameters of @xmath9 can be reconstructed from @xmath15 using limber s equation @xcite .",
    "this process of deprojection of the 2pcf is more complicated than in the first case because it comprises the usage of the redshift distribution function of objects and analytical functions describing the clustering evolution . nevertheless , taking into account smaller sizes and larger volumes of quasar spectroscopic surveys compared to surveys of galaxies , the angular 2pcf is still appealing for quasars because it does not include redshift information and",
    "thus allows the use of catalogues of photometrically classified quasars , which probe to deeper flux limits , and so typically contain an order of magnitude larger number of objects than spectroscopic quasar catalogues .",
    "study of the angular clustering of photometrically selected quasars was pioneered by @xcite using the catalogues of nbckde photometrically selected quasar candidates from sdss @xcite based on the early and the 4th data releases of sdss .",
    "it was shown that the angular 2pcf of quasars is fitted well with a power law @xmath1 , where @xmath18 is a slope of the angular 2pcf .",
    "myers et al . noted that the angular 2pcf does not evolve strongly with redshift , suggesting that the bias of quasars relative to underlying dark matter climbs steeply out to redshift 2.2 .",
    "the reconstructed parameters of the 3d clustering by these authors agree well with the ` direct ' measurements of 3d clustering of quasars conducted e.g. by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the clustering of quasars with those of x - ray point - like sources , a large majority of which are supposed to be agn .",
    "the study of the x - ray agn clustering has been conducted intensively since the release of the x - ray sky surveys , such as rosat all - sky survey , xmm - newton and chandra , and especially after the cross - correlation of x - ray surveys with optical redshift surveys of agns ( for some latest results see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present our study of the angular and spatial clustering of photometrically selected quasar candidates from the sdss nbckde catalogue @xcite , based on the 6th release of the sdss .",
    "this catalogue is 3 times larger than that used in @xcite , which allowed us to place more tight restrictions on the samples , namely to reject objects with photometric redshift determination probability less than 0.5 , and to construct the main sample only from objects with redshifts within the ` sdss window ' , unlike @xcite , who used the whole redshift range of the catalogue .",
    "this or slightly wider ` window ' is traditionally used in studies of spectroscopic samples because of the better efficiency of the photometric selection algorithm of quasars , and because of the peak of the quasar distribution within this redshift range .",
    "although we follow @xcite in deprojection of the angular 2pcf and calculation of the bias parameter , our algorithm of the random catalogue generation differs from the traditional technique , used by @xcite , which is an important issue in verification of the 2pcf results .",
    "the samples , procedure their selection and properties , along with a random catalogue generation method are described in sec.[sec:2 ] .",
    "the technique of the angular 2pcf calculation , its results and discussion are presented in sec.[sec:3 ] .",
    "reconstruction of the spatial clustering parameters along with the corresponding technique are described in sec.[sec:4 ] .",
    "sec.[sec:5 ] contains the results on the luminosity and redshift dependence of the quasar clustering along with comparison with other studies of optical quasar samples and samples of x - ray selected agns . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] we sum up the results . throughout the paper",
    "we calculate distances within the spatially flat @xmath19cdm model with @xmath20 and @xmath21kms@xmath22mpc@xmath22 .",
    "our sample is taken from the sdss nbckde catalogue of photometrically classified quasar candidates @xcite that contains 1015082 quasar candidates selected from the photometric imaging data of the sdss using a non - parametric bayesian classification kernel density estimator ( nbc - kde ) .",
    "the objects are all point sources to a limiting magnitude of @xmath23 derived from 8417  deg@xmath24 of imaging from the sdss data release 6 .",
    "the authors have demonstrated that the overall efficiency ( quasars / quasar candidates ) of the catalogue is 95% ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      for our study we selected only the objects with photometric redshifts within the range @xmath25 and photometric redshift range probability @xmath26 .",
    "this redshift range is known as the ` sdss window ' @xcite , i.e. the redshift range where the algorithm for photometric selection of quasar candidates is the most efficient . as the sky coverage of sdss contains one big ` piece ' and three narrow near - equatorial ` stripes ' ,",
    "we excluded these stripes to reduce boundary effects , thus our right ascension range is @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting ( _ initial _ ) sample contains 320761 objects .",
    "its sky coverage is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ad - full - flh ] ( top left panel ) .    as the main criterion of the kde photometric selection algorithm",
    "is based on quasar magnitudes and colours , that have been corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite , any systematic errors in the reddening model can induce additional effects on clustering results ( see @xcite for a discussion of these effects ) . that is why following @xcite we divided our sample into low- ( @xmath28 ) and high - reddening ( @xmath29 ) parts .",
    "the numbers of objects in these parts are 128757 and 192004 for low and high reddening respectively , and their sky coverage is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ad - full - flh ] ( top middle and right panels ) .",
    "our technique of random catalogues generation ( see sec .  [ sec:2 - 6 ] ) requires as smooth as possible shape of the sky coverage . therefore to study the angular 2pcf and possible influence of the different reddening on the results we did not the subsamples described above , but three other samples selected from the _ initial _ sample .",
    "the first , _ full _ , sample is a patch of the sky with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , containing 230829 objects .",
    "the second one is a patch of the sky with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , containing 80107 objects ( 71190 , or 89% , of which are ` low - reddening ' quasars according to the definition given above ) and the third one is a patch of the sky with @xmath30 , @xmath34 , containing 90185 objects ( 79450 , or 88% , of which are ` high - reddening ' quasars ) .",
    "we formally call these last two samples _ low- _ and _ high - reddening _",
    "samples respectively . their sky coverage and the redshift distribution are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ad - full - flh ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : z - flh ] .",
    "one can see , that the redshift distribution for all three samples are quite similar .",
    "note that our various cuts , coupled with the small increase in imaging coverage between sdss dr4 and sdss dr6 , mean that our sample is about the same size as the sample of 299276 photometrically classified quasars used for similar studies in @xcite .",
    "thus , our work should be viewed as a comprehensive check on the techniques and results of @xcite .",
    "+      the kde photometric selection algorithm for quasar candidates has its limitations . based on classifying simulated quasars , @xcite found that the kde technique is 95% efficient , with 5% stellar contamination . to check for additional sources of contamination ( such as those already noted in @xcite ) we selected at random 30000 objects from the _ initial _ sample ( about 10% of the sample ) and examined them by eye using the sdss skyserver web - service . among these 30,000 objects",
    ", 28 appeared to be bright blue parts of spiral galaxies , probably star formation regions , 1 is a faint extended object , probably a marginally resolved galaxy or nebula ( ` star ' according to sdss nomenclature ) , and 4 lie close to diffraction spikes around bright stars .",
    "thus we can conclude , that an additional contamination of the sample by misclassified point - like sources is only @xmath35% , which can be neglected in comparison with the stellar contamination .",
    "these results are very similar to the study of @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite pointed out that contaminating objects such as star - forming regions in nearby galaxies are highly correlated on scales of a few - tenths of an arcsecond .",
    "therefore , our clustering measurements may be significantly inflated on small scales .      to check the luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering we selected three samples with different luminosity . as a characteristic of luminosity",
    ", the absolute magnitude in @xmath36-band , @xmath37 , was chosen .",
    "its value for each object was calculated using the pogson s formula with corrections in the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the luminosity distance of the object in mpc , @xmath40 is the galactic extinction in @xmath36-band , and @xmath41 is the k - correction .",
    "the values of @xmath40 , obtained from the maps by @xcite , were taken from the catalogue .",
    "the values of @xmath41 were obtained from @xcite .    to separate the dependencies on luminosity and redshift , but preserve the sample as large as possible , we restricted the redshift range for the samples with different @xmath37 to @xmath42 , and selected three subsamples with approximately equal number of objects .",
    "these subsamples , which we called _ bright _ , _ medium - m _ and _ faint _ samples , contain 73307 , 77891 and 73262 objects with absolute magnitudes in @xmath36-band within the ranges @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "corresponding mean values of @xmath37 are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "note , that we used photometric redshifts to calculate the absolute magnitudes , therefore this division is only approximate .",
    "the redshift distributions of these subsamples are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : z - lum ] .",
    "it is clearly seen , that even when choosing the relatively narrow @xmath49-range , the distribution of the faintest objects differs from the distribution of other objects and has a peak at lower redshifts .",
    "it means , that any dependence on luminosity , which can be obtained , would be ` contaminated ' by the redshift - dependence .      to study the redshift dependence of the quasar clustering , i.e. the clustering evolution , we chose all the objects from the sdss nbckde catalogue with the same @xmath18 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 restrictions as for the _ full _ sample , but with the whole redshift range , and divided it into three parts with approximately equivalent number of objects in each .",
    "the number of objects in the obtained samples with redshift ranges @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( we called them the _ nearby _ , _ medium - z _ , and _ distant _ samples ) are 125021 , 123142 and 122057 .",
    "their redshift distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : z - evo ] .",
    "the main characteristics of all considered samples are presented in table  [ tab : samples ] : @xmath18 and @xmath50 ranges , redshift range , the mean redshift , @xmath55 , and the number of objects , @xmath56 .",
    ".characteristics of the samples used in the present work .",
    "see explanation in the text ( sec.[sec:2 ] ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to compare our results on redshift dependence of the quasar bias we plotted them in fig.[fig : bias ] along with the previous results obtained by other authors . as one can see from fig.[fig : r0 ] and [ fig : bias ] , our results on @xmath57 agree well with the results of previous studies of spectroscopic quasar samples , unlike e.g. @xcite who did not place such restrictions on the probability of redshift determination , as we do , that can result in substantial ` contamination ' of low - redshift samples with high - redshift quasars , and hence in overestimation of @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , agreement of our @xmath58 values with the empiric approximation from @xcite , with which most of other results are consistent , is only within 2@xmath16 .",
    "the possible reasons of this discrepancy were discussed in sec.[sec:4 - 2 ] .",
    "we also compare our clustering measurements with the results from deep x - ray surveys , which now allow to study the clustering up to @xmath59 .",
    "we tried to summarise their recent results for the highest redshifts , which are close to our samples , in table[tab : xray ] .",
    "about 95% of x - ray point - like sources away from the galactic plane are usually considered to be agns .",
    "these agns are largely missed in optical surveys due to their small optical luminosity .",
    "x - ray sources with high hardness ratio of the spectrum are considered to be obscured and hence belong to type ii agns which do not have broad emission lines in optical range , like seyfert 2 galaxies , while the soft - spectrum sources are mostly unobscured ( type i ) agns . generally speaking",
    ", this classification is not strict , e.g. @xcite noted that the class of non - broad line agns ( no - blagn ) may include obscured agn , weak unobscured agn , whose optical emission is diluted by the host galaxy light , and normal galaxies .",
    "therefore the objects classification in table[tab : xray ] is given according to authors .",
    "the type i / type ii division in @xcite was made using the hardness of x - ray spectrum , while @xcite made this division using optical spectroscopic data .",
    "@xcite selected non - quasar objects with the help of optical colour - magnitude diagram for the agn host galaxies .",
    "more accurate classification was made by @xcite and @xcite , who used both x - ray spectrum hardness and optical spectroscopy data .",
    "e.g. @xcite found that the fractions of type i agns in the soft- and hard - spectrum subsamples used by them are 56.4% and 15.4% , respectively . in cases",
    "when additional classification was not provided by authors , most part of objects are likely agns .",
    "due to small optical luminosity the cross - identification of x - ray sources with the optical counterparts , and hence the redshift measurement , is a complicated task .",
    "that is why the same technique of deprojection of the angular 2pcf is often used to study the x - ray sources clustering .",
    "this technique allows to use large samples , but its results are dependent on the choice of the clustering model and luminosity function , which is needed to derive the redshift distribution .",
    "e.g. @xcite studied the angular 2pcf of 432 objects in soft @xmath60kev band and 462 objects in total @xmath61kev band from xmm - newton/2df survey and deprojected it using the luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model for the x - ray luminosity function from @xcite . @xcite",
    "conducted the first measurements of the angular 2pcf of x - ray point sources detected in the xmm - newton observations of the 2deg@xmath24 cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) field and deprojected it using the ldde model from citealtueda+2003 .",
    "later , @xcite measured the angular 2pcf of @xmath62 x - ray sources observed by xmm - newton and found that obscured and unobscured objects share similar clustering properties . therefore they both reside in similar environments , that is in agreement with the unified model of agn .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the angular 2pcf of @xmath63 x - ray sources from xmm - newton large scale structure ( xmm - lss ) survey .",
    "they argue that the sources with a hard spectrum are more clustered than the soft - spectrum ones , that may evidence for these types of sources to reside in different environments .",
    "the values of @xmath57 from @xcite and @xcite presented in table[tab : xray ] were obtained for ldde model from @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath57 , @xmath64 from @xcite , presented in table[tab : xray ] are obtained within the clustering evolution model , which is constant in comoving coordinates , i.e. for @xmath65 .",
    "note , that the median or effective @xmath49 indicated for the works mentioned above are also derived from the model .    on the other hand , with the appearance of the deep multi - wavelength survey it become possible to study the 3-dimensional clustering of x - ray sources directly .",
    "e.g. @xcite measured the projected correlation function over scales @xmath66mpc for a sample of 240 sources with spectroscopic @xmath49 in the 2 ms chandra deep field north ( cdf - n ) and 124 sources in the 1 ms chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "they have detected a significantly different clustering amplitude for 2 fields , but argued , that it is likely due to cosmic variance .",
    "@xcite calculated both redshift - space and projected 2pcf of 233 x - ray point sources from the chandra large area synoptic x - ray survey ( clasxs ) and 252 sources the cdf - n , the redshifts of which were measured using follow - up spectroscopy at keck and subaru telescopes .",
    "the comoving scales used for fitting the projected 2pcf were @xmath67mpc and @xmath68mpc for cdf - n and clasxs , respectively . using the @xmath69 relation they have also found the bias parameter for the combined sample .",
    "note , that the median redshift of the cdf - n sample presented in the table[tab : xray ] for @xcite was taken from @xcite , who used the same sample , and the values of @xmath57 were corrected for @xmath70 with @xmath71 used by @xcite , as they are presented in mpc by authors .",
    "@xcite found no significant difference in clustering between hard- and soft - spectrum sources .",
    "the spatial clustering of 538 x - ray sources from xmm - cosmos survey at @xmath72 was studied by @xcite .",
    "they found no evidence for agn with broad optical lines to cluster differently from agn without broad optical lines , and concluded that obscured and unobscured agn are consistent with inhabiting similar environments . with the technique similar to that used in the present work",
    ", they also estimated the bias parameter for the full sample .",
    "the redshift cut at @xmath73 was applied by @xcite for the non - blagn sample to guarantee that it is mostly populated by agn in which the absence of broad optical lines is solely due to nuclear obscuration .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the redshift evolution of the projected 2pcf of 593 x - ray selected agns with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath74 , extracted from the 0.5 - 2kev x - ray mosaic of cosmos , and using different techniques found an evidence of a redshift evolution of the bias factor for the total population of xmm - cosmos agns .",
    "after separate study of subsamples of agns with and without broad optical lines , and x - ray unobscured and obscured agns , they concluded that , for moderate - luminosity x - ray selected agns with broad optical lines , the contribution from major mergers is outnumbered by other processes , possibly secular ones such as tidal disruptions or disk instabilities .",
    "the values of @xmath64 from @xcite presented in table[tab : xray ] were calculated in the halo model approach .",
    "the x - ray samples are 1 - 2 orders smaller than the optical ones , thus for increasing of statistics the cross - correlation function with more abundant objects is also used . e.g. @xcite measured the cross - correlation function of 113 chandra - selected x - ray non - quasar agns at @xmath75 with @xmath76 deep2 galaxies in aegis field , and found that x - ray agn have a similar clustering amplitude as red , quiescent and `` green '' transition galaxies at @xmath77 and are significantly more clustered than blue , star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite argue that the x - ray agn clustering strength is primarily determined by the host galaxy colour , but does not depend on optical brightness , x - ray luminosity , or hardness ratio , at least within the ranges probed in that study . comparing their results with those of @xcite",
    "the authors conclude that high - accretion agn , observed as optically bright quasars , are less clustered and thus are likely hosted in star - forming galaxies , while x - ray agn are hosted both by massive blue galaxies and red galaxies .",
    "our values of @xmath57 , @xmath78 for the _ full _ sample agree well with the results of @xcite and @xcite for the samples of blagn with similar redshift , that is expected because quasars are a part of the type i agns ( agns with broad emission lines ) , while the slopes for non - blagn samples in both papers are smaller than for blagn and for quasars from our sample . the same good agreement ( within @xmath79 )",
    "is seen for the _ nearby _ sample ( @xmath80 ) with the cdf - s agn type i sample ( @xmath81 ) from @xcite , but due to large errors of that results and discrepancy between cdf - n and cdf - s sample a comparison with results by @xcite is complicated .",
    "anyway the values of @xmath78 for samples of type ii agns in @xcite are smaller than those for type i agns , although they are consistent within errors .",
    "the lower value of @xmath78 was also obtained for non - quasar objects by @xcite .    for those samples , which contain a mixture of x - ray point sources a comparison should be done mostly with soft band sources ( @xmath82kev ) , because of obscuration which decreases with increasing of x - ray energy .",
    "thus the sources seen in soft band are probably unobscured and related to type i agns .",
    "although a good agreement is seen between values of @xmath57 , @xmath78 for the _ nearby _ sample only with soft sample ( @xmath83 ) from @xcite . as for other studies of `` mixed '' samples",
    "@xcite , our values of 2pcf parameters are closer to those for hard band sources .",
    "our values of the bias parameter are systematically lower than those for x - ray samples with similar redshifts , which agree with the results of previous studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note , that for lower redshifts optically and x - ray selected agns are found to have similar clustering strength ( see e.g. @xcite )      according to the standard picture of gravitational growth of structure , the mass distribution evolves with redshift and objects should be more clustered in later epoch . on the other hand , as it is clearly seen from fig.[fig : r0 ] , the quasars appear to be more clustered in earlier epoch .",
    "it means that they are biased tracers of the matter distribution and the bias evolves with time , as it is shown in fig.[fig : bias ] .",
    "the evolution of the linear bias parameter can be used , e.g. for estimation of the typical mass of dark matter halo hosting quasars with the theoretical relations derived by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was shown by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , that the host halos of quasars have the same average mass at all redshift , on the other hand the mass of the dark matter halos should grow with time .",
    "it places limits on the lifetime of the quasar activity , which can be estimated within a given model ( e.g. @xcite ) . and finally , having the mass of the dark matter halo and assuming its density profile , one can determine the mass of the central black hole from the relations , suggested by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the main mechanism , that drives the formation of supermassive black holes and triggers quasar activity in ultraviolet and x - ray range , is galaxy mergers .",
    "the first simple semi - analytic models of quasar formation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) assume that quasars radiate at fixed luminosity for some characteristic lifetime , thus there should be a tight relation between the instantaneous quasar luminosity and the mass of the central black hole , which in its turn depends on the dark matter halo mass .",
    "these models are completely ruled out with observations , that show the absence of strong luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering .",
    "the next generation of models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) assumes that bright and faint quasars are similar sources , observed at different stages of their evolution , thus a broad range of the quasar luminosity corresponds to a narrow range in the masses of quasar host halos , and quasar clustering should depend only weakly on luminosity .",
    "predictions of these models are consistent , at least qualitatively , with the results on optical luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering , obtained by different authors @xcite , and in the present work . on the other hand ,",
    "the result clustering of x - ray selected quasars and other types of agns require more detailed models of agn formation ( e.g. @xcite ) . for discussion of this problem , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one of the main consequence of the smaller bias of the optically selected quasars than that of the x - ray selected agns , is that the theories of the quasar formation , in which agns are fuelled only by major mergers is not enough to describe these results and other mechanisms like tidal disruption or disk instability are required to be additional triggers of agn activity .",
    "using the sdss nbckde catalogue of photometrically selected quasar candidates @xcite drawn from the 6th release of the sdss we studied the angular and spatial clustering of quasars with the help of the 2pcf .",
    "for this purpose own technique of the random catalogue generation was investigated and used .",
    "the catalogue is 3 times larger than that used in previous studies by @xcite , which allowed us to place more tight restrictions on the samples , namely to reject objects with photometric redshift determination probability less than 0.5 , and to construct the main sample only from objects with redshifts within the ` sdss window ' , @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "hence , even having the main sample with 230829 objects , which is not larger than the samples used by myers at al .",
    ", our results should be viewed as a corroboration of these previous works , with the main utilities being our use of an independent technique to generate random catalogues , and also use of a sample with `` higher quality '' .",
    "the main results of this work are the following :    1 .   the angular 2pcf of photometrically selected quasars , averaged over @xmath0 , is approximated well with the power law @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 over the range @xmath4 , that agree well with previous results by @xcite for similar mean redshift , but averaged over broader @xmath5 range .",
    "the parameters of the deprojected 2pcf averaged over @xmath0 and modelled with a power law @xmath6 , are @xmath7mpc , @xmath8 , which are in perfect agreement with previous results from spectroscopic surveys .",
    "3 .   splitting the sample into three redshift ranges",
    ", we confirmed the evidence for an increase of the clustering amplitude with redshift , found in previous studies of photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed quasar samples . 4 .   selecting three subsamples with different @xmath37 and @xmath0",
    ", we have found no evidence for luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering . the marginal decrease in correlation length for the sample of _ faint _",
    "quasars can be addressed to the redshift evolution , which is hard to avoid when analysing different luminosity subsamples within a broad redshift range .",
    "this result is consistent with the models of the quasar formation , in which bright and faint quasars are assumed to be similar sources , hosted by dark matter halos of similar masses , but observed at different stages of their evolution .",
    "5 .   comparison of our results with studies of the x - ray selected agns with similar redshift showed that the clustering amplitude of optically selected quasars is similar to that of x - ray selected quasars , but it is lower than that of samples of all x - ray selected agns .",
    "as far as x - ray selected agn samples contain both agn types , this result evidences for different types of agns to reside in different environments .",
    "we also investigated our sample and found that in addition to the well - known stellar contamination of photometrically selected quasar candidates there is also a small ( about 0.1% ) contamination by artifacts of the automatic selection technique of point sources .",
    "these include star formation regions in spiral galaxies and diffraction spikes around bright stars .",
    "these artifacts were already extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "the subsamples with high and low galactic extinction ( reddening ) showed similar results on 2pcf , suggesting that galactic reddening does not strongly influence quasar clustering when our technique for random - catalogue - generation is adopted .",
