    "the advances in the technologies of nanofabrication in the last few decades allowed intensive investigation efforts in nanostructured superconductors , both in the experimental and theoretical fronts .",
    "it is well known that , for very confined geometries , the superconducting - normal ( sn ) magnetic field transition is increased extraordinarily .",
    "it was experimentally observed that for an al square very thin film with a size of few micrometers the upper critical field @xmath0 can be increased up to 3.32 with the inclusion of defects , 2.01 larger then the usual value of @xmath0.@xcite furthermore , numerical simulations carried out in a circular wedge ( see ref .   and references therein ) , have shown that , by keeping the area of this geometry constant , the sn transition field is a uniform increasing function with decreasing the angular width @xmath1 and diverges as the angle goes to zero .",
    "another important issue in confined geometries is the occurrence of giant vortices .",
    "the experimental observation of giant vortex in mesoscopic superconductor is still a controversial issue . through multi - small - tunnel - junction measurements in an al thin disk film , kanda _ _ et",
    "al.__@xcite have argued that , as the vorticity increases , giant vortex configuration will occur . on the other hand ,",
    "scanning squid microscopy on nb thin film , both square and triangle , can not guarantee giant vortex configurations , at least for low vorticity.@xcite early numerical simulation of the present authors@xcite have shown the dynamic of the nucleation of giant and multi - vortex state before they set into an equilibrium configuration for a square geometry .",
    "it is well known that the phenomenology of superconductivity can be described by the time dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equations.@xcite the present contribution uses the tdgl approach to address the issues above , namely , of the nucleation of vortices in confined geometries and the behavior of the transition field for a deformable geometry . for this",
    ", we have chosen a circular sector ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , where we can arbitrarily change its shape .",
    "to our best knowledge , the discretization of the tdgl equations , by using the link variables technique , has been done only in rectangular coordinates.@xcite so , we will extend this algorithm to circular geometries by using polar coordinates .",
    "our procedure makes possible to generalize the algorithm to any geometry .",
    "the key point in such problem is how to write the auxiliary fields appropriately according to the system of coordinates , making the development of the present algorithm a specific algorithm necessary .",
    "otherwise , the purpose of generalization will not be achieved .",
    "we anticipate that the two slopes of the present work will show that : _ ( a ) _ as we decrease the area of the circular sector , the transition field may increase for large angles , but all the curves will collapse into the asymptotic behavior @xmath2 ; and _ ( b ) _ only the confinement of vortices is not sufficient to obtain giant vortex state , but also the geometry is very important to favor the nucleation of such configurations .",
    "the geometry we have chosen does not allow us to assure clearly the nucleation of giant vortex .",
    "for a circular sector of several angular widths , ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , having the same area as a disk , a square and a triangle , we did not observe the occurrence of giant vortex as previous numerical simulations have predicted for those geometries.@xcite in addition , we will show that the criterion used for nucleation of giant vortex may lead us to non conclusive pictures , at least for the geometry under the present investigation .    the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sectdgl ]",
    "we write the tdgl equations in a gauge invariant form by using the auxiliary field in polar coordinates . in section  [ secnum ]",
    "we develop the algorithm we use to solve the tdgl equations : we define the mesh used to discretize the tdgl for a circular sector , the discrete variables which are evaluated in the mesh , the boundary conditions and , finally , the important physical quantities which will be extracted from the numerical setup are determined . in section  [ secrd ]",
    "we present and discuss the results of the numerical simulations for certain parameters of a superconducting circular sector .",
    "the properties of the superconducting state are usually described by the complex order parameter @xmath5 , for which the absolute square value @xmath6 represents the superfluid density , and the vector potential @xmath7 , which is related to the local magnetic field as @xmath8 .",

    ", we will neglect the @xmath17-dependence on the order parameter .",
    "this is valid either if the system is infinite along the @xmath17-direction or if it is a very thin film of thickness @xmath18 .",
    "however , in the former case , @xmath19 is replaced by an effective ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath20 ( for instance , see references and ) .",
    "the generalization to the a system of arbitrary thickness should not present any difficulty .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary vector field @xmath21 in polar coordinates , which is defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary reference point . for the sake of brevity",
    "we omit the time dependence on the fields .",
    "notice that @xmath24 and that @xmath25    upon using these two last equations recursively , we obtain @xmath26    as a consequence , we obtain for the kinetic term in the first tdgl equation @xmath27 -\\frac{\\bar{\\cal u}_{\\theta}}{\\rho^2 }    \\frac{\\partial^2 ( { \\cal u}_{\\theta}\\psi)}{\\partial \\theta^2}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from equations ( [ ds ] ) , it can also be easily proved that @xmath28 & = & { \\rm i m } \\left [ \\bar{\\cal u}_{\\rho}\\bar{\\psi }      \\frac{\\partial ( { \\cal u}_{\\rho}\\psi ) }      { \\partial\\rho}\\right ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the stationary solution for @xmath130 is then used as the initial state to determine the solution for @xmath132 , and so on .",
    "usually we started from zero field and increased @xmath130 until superconductivity is destroyed .",
    "as a criterion for termination of the simulation , we monitored the gibbs free energy as a function of @xmath130 . when the value of this quantity changes its sign , then the transition from the superconducting to the normal state sets in .",

    "we used @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the area , such that the external radio is given by @xmath139 .",
    "the reason for taking these parameters as such is because it makes possible comparison between our results and previous ones ( see ref .  , and references therein ) .",
    "the size of the mesh varied according to the value of @xmath1 . as a criterion we have taken the length of the most external unit cell no larger then @xmath140 . since the order parameter varied most significantly over a distance @xmath141 ( in real units ) , we are certain of not loosing this variation within this criterion .",
    "we ramp up the applied magnetic field , typically in steps of @xmath142 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the magnetization versus external applied magnetic field curves for several values of the angular width .",
    "these pictures present a typical profile of a magnetization curve of a mesoscopic superconductor .",
    "it presents a series of discontinuities , in which each jump signals the entrance of more vortices into the sample .",
    "notice that the lower critical field does not vary with the shape of the circular sector . from this",
    ", the immediate conclusion is that it depends only on the area but not on @xmath1 .",
    "this is not an obvious result .",
    "in fact , in ref .   numerical simulations were performed in three different geometries : disk , square , and triangle and using the same parameters as in the present contribution . they find that the magnitude of the lower critical field is the same for the disk and the square , but slightly larger for the triangle , despite all geometries having the same area .",
    "since we have the freedom to deform the circular sector , it should be expected similar behavior for the lower critical field , especially for small width angles @xmath1 .",
    "however , the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] do not seem to exhibit this feature .",
    "another interesting feature present in the pictures of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is that the sn transition field @xmath143 is approximately the same for all angles greater than @xmath144 .",
    "in addition , @xmath143 is approximately the same for a disk and a square of equivalent area .",
    "however , for smaller values of @xmath1 , this critical field becomes significantly larger .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xmath143 was calculated numerically for a wedge .",
    "the area they used for the wedge is @xmath145 larger than the one we used here .",
    "they found that their results fit quite well into the following expression @xmath146    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we depict both the above expression and what we have found for the nucleation field @xmath147 as a function of @xmath148 . as can be seen from that figure , for large angles",
    ", the nucleation field is larger in the geometry we consider .",
    "this suggests that , had we diminished the area of the circular sector , this difference for large angles would have increased . nonetheless , for small angles all curves should collapse into a single curve , which corresponds to the asymptotic behavior @xmath149 determined in ref .",
    "this suggests that the superconductor behaves as an unidimensional system as @xmath1 becomes small , no matter what the area is .",
    ".the sequence of vortex configurations for four different angles of the circular sector .",
    "the nomenclature used is explained in the text .",
    "the configurations in brackets corresponds to what we obtain not using a logarithm scale . [",
    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also investigated the topology of the order parameter . before going any further , let us establish the criterion we use to distinguish a single vortex from a giant vortex state .",
    "a giant vortex is nucleated as two or more vortices collapse into a single vortex in which all of them have , rigorously , a common core center . to describe an @xmath127 vortex state we use the following nomenclature .",
    "we denote by @xmath150 , a multiple vortex configuration formed by @xmath151 single vortices .",
    "a single giant vortex of vorticity @xmath152 is denoted by @xmath153 .",
    "for example , the @xmath154 state is formed by four single vortices and a double quantized giant vortex .    in all geometries",
    "we have considered , usually it occurs transitions either from @xmath127 to @xmath155 or from @xmath127 to @xmath156 vortices . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] we depict @xmath157 for @xmath158 and @xmath159 respectively , and two stationary states with different values of @xmath130 .",
    "we have chosen transitions where we could have the formation of a giant vortex .",
    "as can be seen in these figures , we have the transitions @xmath160 ( @xmath158 ) and @xmath161 ( @xmath159).@xcite however , if we look at the same pictures in a logarithm scale , we still see that the core centers of the vortices occupy different positions .",
    "so , within this criterion , we can not affirm that a giant vortex has been nucleated .",
    "for higher vorticity , we have not observed any giant vortex either .",
    "a very different scenario takes place in disks , squares , and triangles even using the same parameters as in the present work.@xcite maybe , for smaller areas , giant vortex could be formed ; we have not tested this possibility .",
    "all possible configurations are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] up to @xmath162 .",
    "notice that the vortices are always symmetrically distributed along the mediatrix .",
    "in summary , an algorithm has been developed for solving the ginzburg - landau theory for circular geometries .",
    "this will probably make much easier to extend the @xmath163 method for other geometries in addition to the circular an rectangular ones .",
    "furthermore , we have applied the algorithm to circular sector and have found several configurations for the vortex state in this geometry .",
    "also , the superconducting nucleation field has been evaluated .",
    "we have presented some evidences that , as we diminishes the area of the supercondutor , the nucleation field increases . however , as the angular width goes to low values , this field exhibits an universal behavior , independently of the area .",
