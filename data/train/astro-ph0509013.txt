    "fractal dimensions characterize the geometric support of a structure but can not provide any information about a possible distribution or a probability that may be part of a given structure .",
    "this problem has been solved by defining an infinite set of dimensions known as generalized dimensions which are achieved by dividing the object under study into pieces , each piece is labelled by an index i=0,1,2 .... n . if we associate a probability @xmath0 with each piece of size @xmath1 than partition function is obtained which permits to define generalized dimension @xmath2 @xmath3 here q is a parameter which can take all values between -@xmath4 to @xmath4 .",

    "this formalism is called as multi - fractal formalism which characterizes both the geometry of a given structure and the probability measure associated with it .",
