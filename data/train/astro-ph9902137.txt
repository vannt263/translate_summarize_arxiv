    "neutron induced reactions on @xmath0ar occur in the weak component of the s - process , where the most relevant neutron energies are situated in the kev range . in order to calculate the maxwellian averaged cross section in this energy region",
    ", the reactions under investigation have to be studied with thermal as well as with resonance neutrons . the thermal value is often used to normalise the higher energy values and besides it is needed in the calculation of the maxwellian averaged cross section as a summation of the thermal and resonance components@xcite .",
    "samples with a well - defined mass are of great importance to perform reliable reaction cross section measurements , so a lot of effort was put in the preparation and characterisation of suited samples . a detailed description of the procedure is given in@xcite .",
    "@xmath0ar atoms were produced via the @xmath0cl(p , n)@xmath0ar reaction by bombarding a nacl target with 30 mev protons from a cyclotron of the ucl at louvain - la - neuve ( belgium ) .",
    "these atoms were then ionised to the 1@xmath8 state and implanted at 8 kev in a 20 @xmath9 m thick al - foil .",
    "different samples were produced , containing @xmath10 up to @xmath11 atoms .",
    "these numbers were determined at the irmm in geel via the detection of the 2.6 kev kx - rays ( emitted in the decay of @xmath0ar ) with a gas flow proportional counter .",
    "the experiments with thermal neutrons were performed at the end of the 87 m curved neutron guide h22 of the high flux reactor at the ill in grenoble ( france ) .",
    "a well - thermalised flux of about @xmath12 neutrons/@xmath13 was available at the sample position .",
    "the @xmath0ar samples were mounted in a vacuum chamber together with suited surface barrier detectors , placed outside the neutron beam . a typical charged particle spectrum obtained during a 62 h neutron irradiation of one of the @xmath14ar samples",
    "is shown in figure [ figure 1 ] .",
    "the results of these measurements are summarised in table 1 .",
    "comparison of our results with those obtained by ashgar et al.@xcite shows that our values for both the ( n@xmath15,@xmath3 ) and ( n@xmath15,p ) cross sections are about two times smaller , which indicates that the discrepancy most likely lies in the determination of the number of @xmath0ar atoms in the sample or in the neutron flux determination .",

    "a second measuring cycle , with the linac operating at 800 hz , provided us with cross section data for neutron energies up to 15 kev ( figure [ figure 2 ] ) .",
    "two strong resonances were observed at 1.6 kev and at 2.5 kev , with resonance areas of @xmath26 b.kev and @xmath27 b.kev . in a third measuring cycle we used a surface barrier detector mounted in a vacuum chamber and realised good experimental conditions up to 70 kev neutron energy . here , two smaller resonances were observed at 25 kev and at 40 kev .",
    "resonance areas are in the order of 12 b.kev and 15 b.kev respectively .",
