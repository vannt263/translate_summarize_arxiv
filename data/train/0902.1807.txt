    "the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) process , in which a point - like lepton probes a single , initial state hadron , is an ideal environment in which to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and constrain the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton .",
    "the hera collider ceased running in june 2007 , following 15 years of successful operation .",
    "during hera i running ( 1992 - 2000 ) , the h1 and zeus experiments each collected approximately @xmath3 @xmath4 of @xmath0 and @xmath5 @xmath4 of @xmath1 data .",
    "this has allowed precision measurements of inclusive neutral ( nc ) and charged ( cc ) current dis cross sections , which have already proved fundamental to the rapid development in understanding of qcd and the structure of the proton .    in these proceedings , a joint h1 and zeus analysis",
    "is presented , in which previously published nc and cc inclusive dis cross section measurements from the two collider experiments are combined . the combination method  @xcite uses an iterative @xmath6 minimisation , which carefully takes into account the correlations within the data that result from different sources of uncertainty .",
    "the key assumption is that the measurements from h1 and zeus represent a common truth .",
    "thus , forcing them to agree results in a strong constraint which cross - calibrates the measurements , resulting in significantly reduced overall uncertainties .",
    "the combined hera data have subsequently been used as the sole input to a next - to - leading ( nlo ) qcd fit to determine the proton pdfs .",
    "this analysis is also discussed in the present contribution .",
    "the results on the combined hera data , as presented here , were first released to the lp conference in 2007  @xcite , and the nlo qcd analysis was first presented at dis 2008  @xcite .",
    "both analyses should be seen as part of a mid - term strategy .",
    "they will be followed by future data combinations , including even more accurate data from both hera i and hera ii , and by further qcd analyses to extract the proton pdfs .",
    "lepton - proton dis can proceed either via the neutral current ( nc ) interaction ( through the exchange of a @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) , or via the charged current ( cc ) interaction ( through the exchange of a @xmath9 ) .",
    "the kinematics of lepton - proton dis are described in terms of the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath10 , the negative invariant mass squared of the exchanged vector boson , @xmath11 , and the fraction of energy transferred from the lepton to the proton system ( in the rest frame of the proton ) , @xmath12 .",
    "the three quantities are related by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the centre - of - mass energy squared .    at leading order ( lo ) in the electroweak interaction , the reduced cross section , @xmath15 , for the @xmath16 nc dis process",
    "can be expressed in terms of proton structure functions , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fine structure constant and @xmath19 describes the helicity dependence of the electroweak interaction .",
    "the structure functions , which depend on @xmath2 , are directly related to pdfs of the proton , and their @xmath11 dependence is predicted by perturbative qcd . in particular ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 depend directly on the quark distributions . for @xmath22 @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath20 dominates the @xmath24 scattering cross section and for @xmath25 , @xmath20 itself is dominated by sea quarks while the @xmath11 dependence is driven by gluon radiation .",
    "@xmath20 has been measured over 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath2 , to a precision of @xmath26 at hera i. therefore , hera data have already provided vital information on the sea - quarks and gluon at low @xmath10 . at high @xmath27 ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath21 becomes increasingly significant and gives information on the valence quarks . at lo ,",
    "the cc cross sections are given by , @xmath28 ~~ \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{{\\rm d}^2\\sigma_{\\rm cc}^{e^{-}p}}{{\\rm d}x{\\rm d}q^2 }   = \\frac{g_f^2m_w^4}{2\\pi(q^2+m_w^2)^2 }   \\left [ { u}+{c}+(1-y)^2(\\bar{d}+\\bar{s } ) \\right ] ~~ \\nonumber \\vspace{-0.2 cm } \\label{eqn : cc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that a measurement of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections provides information on the @xmath29- and @xmath30-valence quarks , respectively , thereby allowing the separation of flavour .",
    "in this section , the joint h1 and zeus combined data analysis is described .",
    "the goal of the study is to obtain dis cross sections of best possible accuracy in order produce precise extractions of the proton pdfs .",
    "a new nlo qcd analysis , in which the results of the combination are used as the sole input , is described in sec .  [",
    "sec : qcdanalysis ] .",
    "the averaging procedure uses the lagrange multiplier ( or hessian ) method  @xcite .",
    "the only theoretical input to the combination is that there is a true value of the cross section for each process , at each @xmath2 value  @xcite .",
    "the correlated systematic uncertainties are floated coherently such that each experiment calibrates the other one .",
    "this results in a significant reduction of the correlated systematic uncertainty over much of the kinematic plane .    in the combination procedure , the following probability distribution of a measurement quantity , @xmath31 , represented as a @xmath6 function , is minimised : @xmath32 ^ 2}{\\delta_i^2 } + \\sum_j \\frac{\\alpha_j^2}{\\delta^2_{\\alpha_j}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 are the measured central values , and @xmath34 are the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties of the quantity @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath35 are their true values ; @xmath36 are parameters for the @xmath37 sources of systematic uncertainty and @xmath38 denotes the sensitivity of point @xmath39 to source @xmath37 . for the cross section measurements ,",
    "the index @xmath39 labels a particular measurement at a given @xmath2 .",
    "equation  [ eqn : chi2 ] represents the correlated probability distribution function for the quantity @xmath35 and for the systematic uncertainties @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath6 defined in eq .",
    "[ eqn : chi2 ] has , by construction , a minimum @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the total uncertainty for @xmath35 determined from the formal minimisation of eq .",
    "[ eqn : chi2 ] is equal to the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the covariance matrix cov(@xmath43 ) quantifies the correlation between experimental points .    in the analysis of more than one data set , a total @xmath6 function , @xmath44 ,",
    "is constructed from the sum of the @xmath6 functions for each data set .",
    "the @xmath44 function can be minimised with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 : this minimisation corresponds to a generalisation of the averaging procedure which takes account of correlations between different data sets .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the hera combined @xmath16 nc and cc inclusive data , described in sec .  [",
    "sec : combineddata ] , have been used as the experimental input to the present qcd analysis in that only data with @xmath45 were transformed in @xmath46 . ] .",
    "the consistency of the combined hera data set , as well as its small systematic uncertainties , allow the experimental uncertainties on the pdfs to be calculated using a @xmath6 tolerance of @xmath47 .",
    "this is compared to previous global fits where increased tolerances of @xmath48 have been used in order to account for data inconsistencies .",
    "for the present qcd fit , the role of correlated systematics is no longer crucial since the uncertainties are relatively small . in particular",
    ", this means that similar results are obtained whether the correlated systematic uncertainties are treated using the offset or hessian method in the qcd fit , or by simply combining statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "for the central fit the choice was made to combine the 43 systematic uncertainties ( resulting from the separate h1 and zeus data sets ) in quadrature and to offset the 4 sources of uncertainty which arise from the combination procedure .",
    "this was found to result in the most conservative uncertainty estimate on the extracted pdfs .                  despite the conservative procedure adopted , as mentioned above , the experimental uncertainties on the resulting pdfs were still found to be impressively small . therefore , a thorough consideration of further uncertainties due to model assumptions was necessary . for the present analysis ,",
    "six sources of model uncertainty were considered , as listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : model ] .",
    "the parameters were varied up and down from the central value , and the differences in the resulting pdfs from the central fit were added in quadrature to the total experimental pdf uncertainty .",
    "further cross checks were also performed .",
    "in particular , the dependence on the choice of parameterisation was investigated by repeating the fit using the h1-style @xcite and zeus - style @xcite parameterisations .",
    "all fits gave acceptable @xmath6 and were found to be consistent with each other .",
    "note , however , that the parameterisation chosen for the central fit ( described in sec .  [ sec : qcdfit - analysis ] ) gave the best @xmath6 as well as the most conservative experimental uncertainties .",
    "the nlo qcd analysis described above has been named the herapdf0.1 fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : nccc - herafit ] shows the results of the hera fit superimposed on the combined high-@xmath11 nc and cc @xmath16 data sets , showing the excellent description of the data by the hera pdfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : herapdf ] shows the herapdf0.1 pdfs @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( total sea ) and @xmath52 as a function of @xmath10 at @xmath53 @xmath23 and @xmath54 @xmath23 .",
    "fractional uncertainty bands are shown beneath each plot , with the experimental and model uncertainties being shown separately .",
    "the variation of the strange fraction , @xmath55 , dominates the model uncertainty on the sea , while variations of @xmath56 and @xmath57 dominate those on the gluon and valence quarks .",
    "comparison of the results for @xmath53 @xmath23 and @xmath54 @xmath23 shows that , as @xmath11 increases , the pdf uncertainties become impressively small .",
    "the summary plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : herapdfsummary ] illustrate that the total uncertainty of the pdfs obtained from the hera combined data set is much reduced compared to the those of the pdfs extracted from separate analyses of the h1 and zeus data sets .",
    "the dramatic improvement is a result of the data combination .",
    "figure  [ fig : globalpdfs ] compares the herapdf 0.1 pdfs to those of the cteq6.1  @xcite and mrst01  @xcite global fits confidence level , while the global fits show a @xmath58 confidence level band . ] .",
    "the results indicate that the precision of the herapdf0.1 pdfs for the low @xmath10 sea and gluon is impressive .",
    "a new , model - independent method of combining cross section measurements has been presented , in which a coherent treatment of systematics results in a substantial reduction in the overall uncertainties .",
    "the method has been demonstrated on the complete set of published hera i nc and cc inclusive dis data .",
    "the combined hera data have subsequently been included in a new nlo qcd analysis .",
    "the consistent treatment of systematic uncertainties in the combined data set ensures that the experimental uncertainties on the pdfs can be calculated without need for an increased @xmath6 tolerance .",
    "this results in pdfs with greatly reduced experimental uncertainties compared to separate analyses of data from the h1 and zeus experiments .",
    "model uncertainties have also been carefully considered .",
    "the resulting pdfs ( called herapdf0.1 ) have impressive precision .",
    "they are now publicly available in lhapdf  @xcite ( v5.6 onwards ) .",
    "high statistics data from the hera ii running period are being analysed by the two collaborations and will be included in subsequent analyses devoted to precision determinations of the proton parton densities .",
