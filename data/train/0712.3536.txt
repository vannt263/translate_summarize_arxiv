    "the accuracy in the energy determination of ultra - high energy cosmic rays using the fluorescence technique is presently limited by the uncertainty in the air - fluorescence yield . in order to improve the accuracy of this fundamental parameter ,",
    "several laboratory measurements are being performed @xcite . on the other hand , progress on the theoretical understanding of the various processes leading to the air - fluorescence emission",
    "is being carried out . at high pressure",
    "( @xmath0 1 torr ) and high electron energy ( @xmath0 1 kev ) most of the fluorescence light is generated by low energy secondary electrons arising from n@xmath1 ionization @xcite .",
    "a simple model which accounts for the contribution of secondary electrons to the fluorescence yield of the n@xmath1 2p system ( c@xmath2 @xmath3 b@xmath4 ) has been recently published @xcite . using the above model",
    ", the total fluorescence yield has been computed for the first time at high electron energies in @xcite .",
    "since fluorescence is mainly generated by secondary electrons , their energy distribution is a key parameter .",
    "previous results @xcite were obtained using the analytical energy distribution given by opal et al .",
    "@xcite which has been experimentally checked at low energy ( below a few kevs ) .",
    "unfortunately , the extrapolation of this formula to higher energies is not suitable to account for the energy distribution of delta rays properly . in the present paper , a new analytical approach valid in the whole energy interval ( ev - gev )",
    "preliminary updated results of our model using this energy spectrum together with improved molecular parameters and a more realistic monte carlo simulation are presented in this paper .",
    "proportionality between fluorescence intensity and the energy deposited by the primary electron is usually assumed .",
    "experimental results seem to support this assumption , at least , in small energy intervals .",
    "recently the macfly collaboration has extended this experimental test to a large energy range , 1.5 mev - 50 gev , finding proportionality within their experimental errors of about 15% @xcite .    however , from a theoretical point of view this proportionality is not obvious .",
    "the excitation of the fluorescence emission is strongly peaked at low energies , in particular for the 2p system of nitrogen and therefore the ratio of fluorescence emission and deposited energy is strongly dependent on the spectrum of low energy secondaries . in principle",
    ", this spectrum depends on both the primary energy and the distance from the primary interaction , and thus , this proportionality has to be demonstrated with a detailed analysis .",
    "the model described in @xcite shows that the total number of photons of the @xmath5 band generated by an electron per unit path length in a thin target can be expressed by    @xmath6    @xmath7 is the number of nitrogen molecules per unit volume .",
    "collisional de - excitation ( quenching ) is taken into account by the well - known stern - volmer factor which depends on the characteristic pressure @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in this expression , the fluorescence intensity is a sum of two contributions : a ) direct excitation of @xmath5 band by the primary electron , given by the optical cross section @xmath9 and b ) contributions from secondary electrons arising from molecular ionizations , proportional to the ionization cross section .",
    "the optical cross section is defined by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the cross section for electron excitation ( ionization ) of molecular nitrogen in the ground state to the upper @xmath12 level of an excited electronic state of n@xmath1 ( n@xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 are the @xmath5 radiative transition probabilities ( einstein coefficients ) . therefore the optical cross sections @xmath15 , @xmath16 used below are associated to the emission of a 337 nm and 391 nm photon respectively induced by electron collision on a n@xmath1 molecule .    for high pressures ( @xmath0 1 torr ) and energies ( @xmath0 1 kev )",
    "the contribution from secondary electrons is dominant for generation of 2p fluorescence and relevant for the 1n bands .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 in ( [ fy1 ] ) represents the average number of @xmath5 photons generated inside the observation volume as a result of a primary ionization in the absence of quenching .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath17 has to be carried out by a monte carlo simulation which takes into account the various generations of secondary electrons produced after a primary ionization .",
    "the @xmath17 parameter turns out to be a function of primary energy @xmath18 , pressure @xmath19 and the geometrical features of the observation region .",

    "the cross section for the ejection of a k shell electron @xmath22 is shown for comparison .",

    "figure 1 shows the nitrogen cross section versus energy for various e@xmath23-molecule interaction processes of interest in our problem . the cross section for molecular excitation @xmath20 accounts for all excitation processes without emission of a secondary electron . on the other hand",
    ", the ionization cross section @xmath21 accounts for all processes leading to the emission of a secondary electron and can be described at large energy by the born - bethe function . at high energy only optically allowed transitions , also well described by a born - bethe function , contribute and therefore @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "the cross section for the ejection of a k shell electron @xmath22 is shown for comparison .",
    "figure 1 also shows the optical cross sections ( [ py ] ) for the excitation of the 2p ( 0 - 0 ) and 1n ( 0 - 0 ) bands of n@xmath24 and n@xmath25 respectively . at low energy , experimental values",
    "have been used ( see @xcite for references ) and at high energies @xmath16 has been extrapolated using the born - bethe function . for all cross sections the density correction at high energies @xcite has been applied .",
    "another ingredient of the model is the energy lost by the electrons in each collision process . for molecular excitation ( without electron ejection ) an average value of @xmath26",
    "= 8.5 ev has been estimated . in an ionization process",
    "the lost kinetic energy ( primary and secondary electrons ) equals the n@xmath1 ionization potential , @xmath27 = 15.5 ev , plus the excitation energy of the ion , for which an average value of @xmath28 = 1.3 ev has been estimated at low energies from available data . at large energy k - shell ionization",
    "is also taken into account with a relative probability given by the corresponding cross section . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy is reduced by 410 ev ( k - shell binding energy ) . as a result @xmath28 increases up to 5 ev .    in the present calculations",
    "the tracks of secondary electrons have been simulated using available angular cross section for the various individual interaction processes , including elastic e@xmath23-molecule collisions .",
    "other processes like generation of x ray from molecular de - excitation and bremsstrahlung by high energy electrons have also been included in our simulation although the final results are nearly independent on these processes .",

    "the extended opal formula used in this work fits properly the mller spectrum .",
    "the values of the eedl database are also shown for comparison .",

    "the analytical expression proposed by opal et al .",
    "fits accurately experimental results . at high primary energies , for which no experimental data are published , precise calculations are described by seltzer @xcite .",
    "numerical results for any atom are available in eedl databases @xcite . instead of implementing these databases in our simulation",
    ", we looked for an analytical expression for the energy spectrum in the whole energy range for both primary and secondary electrons .",
    "the desired function must fulfill several requirements : a ) it has to behave as the opal formula at low primary energy ; b ) at high @xmath18 the function has to account for the well known energy spectrum of delta rays , c ) the integral of the differential cross section has to give the total ionization cross section and d ) the assumed function must be consistent with the collision energy loss given by the bethe - bloch theory for electrons .    in this work",
    "a new analytical formula has been used which properly accounts for the above four conditions .",
    "details on this analytical approach will be given in a paper in preparation . in figures 2 and 3 the energy spectrum of secondary electrons predicted by this  extended \" opal formula used in the work is compared with other available data for primary electrons of 1 mev and 1 gev respectively .",
    "fulfilment of requirement d ) can be easily checked as follows .",
    "the energy loss per unit electron path length in air , assuming @xmath29 molecules per unit volume , is closely related with the mean value of the energy distribution of secondary electrons by the following relation    @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean value of the energy distribution of secondary electrons at a given @xmath18 value and    @xmath32 represents the average value of the energy deposited in the medium by the primary electron per primary ionization process .    in figure 4 the energy loss calculated from expression ( [ energy - loss ] ) using the @xmath31 value from our energy distribution of secondary electrons",

    "in this section we will present results on the various parameters of interest for the interpretation of the air fluorescence measurements . in our simulation",
    "the observation region has been assumed to be a sphere of radius @xmath33 with center in the interaction point of the primary electron . assuming a fixed temperature , both fluorescence intensity and deposited energy turn out to be basically dependent on the product @xmath34 , that is , on the number of interactions inside the observation region .",
    "in fact , due to the density correction at very large energies , for a given pr value , the above parameters are slightly dependent on pressure . however , the corresponding deviation is not significant inside the range 100 - 760 torr .",
    "energy deposited by a primary electron per unit path length versus primary energy for several values of @xmath34 ( continuous lines ) . for very high @xmath34 value deposited energy equals the energy loss of the primary electron predicted by the bethe - bloch theory ( broken line).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the energy deposited by the primary electron per unit path length can be calculated from the average energy deposited by secondary electrons @xmath35 as    @xmath36    note that this equation is the same as ( [ energy - loss ] ) replacing @xmath37 by @xmath35 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 has been obtained from our monte carlo simulation .",
    "figure 5 shows the energy deposited per unit path length versus primary energy for several @xmath34 values .",
    "we have checked that , as expected , the deposited energy for an unlimited medium , @xmath38 , equals the energy loss predicted by the bethe - bloch theory .    the fluorescence efficiency @xmath39 , defined as the ratio between the number of fluorescence photons emitted in a given @xmath5 molecular band and the deposited energy is a fundamental parameter .",
    "combining equations ( [ fy1 ] ) and ( [ energy - dep ] ) , the following useful relation can be obtained :    @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fluorescence efficiency in the absence of collisional quenching and thus related with @xmath39 by    @xmath42    the values of @xmath17 and @xmath43 have been computed for the 2p ( 0 - 0 ) and 1n ( 0 - 0 ) bands , for which accurate experimental results of the corresponding cross sections are available .",

    ". nevertheless a smooth dependence on primary energy is found .",
    "the value of @xmath44 decreases with primary energy about 10% in the range 1 kev - 1 mev and 4% in the interval 1 mev - 20 gev for the 337 nm band ( figure 6 ) .",
    "for the 391 band the corresponding decreasing is about 6% for the interval 1 kev - 1 mev and 1% for 1 mev - 20 gev ( figure 7 ) . on the other hand a smooth growing of @xmath44 with @xmath34 , smaller than 2% in the range 10 - 1000 torr@xmath45 cm ,",
    "is also found for energies larger than 1 mev ( figures 8 and 9 ) . at lower energy and/or region",
    "size the fluorescence is clearly not proportional to the deposited energy .",
    "the real number of photons detected per unit of deposited energy @xmath46 can be calculated from equation ( [ phi1 ] ) using the corresponding @xmath8 value .",
    "unfortunately there are significant disagreements in the available experimental data of collisional quenching in air .",
    "therefore the comparison of the absolute value of the efficiency with experimental data is not straightforward . on the other hand ,",

    "an improved model for the air - fluorescence emission has been used to analyze in detail the relationship between fluorescence intensity and deposited energy . for primary energies larger than a few kev and assuming observation regions over 10 torr@xmath45 cm nitrogen fluorescence is nearly proportional to deposited energy . a smooth decrease of @xmath44 of about 10% in the range 1 kev - 1 mev and 4% in the interval 1 mev - 10 gev for the 2p system is found .",
    "taking into account that the contribution of the energy released by an extensive air shower by electrons with energy smaller than 1 mev is only of about 22% @xcite , the above smooth dependence of efficiency on primary energy has no impact on the calibration of fluorescence telescopes",
    ". nevertheless very precise laboratory measurements ( better than 10% ) of the fluorescence yield in the range kevs - gevs could observe this small effect .",
    "the absolute value of the fluorescence efficiency for the 337 nm band computed in this work has been compared with some experimental results .",
    "the comparison was carried out by reducing experimental values of number of photons per meter at atmospheric pressure to @xmath62 using quenching data from other authors . in general",
