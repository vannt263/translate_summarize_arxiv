    "the sine - gordon model was originally proposed as a toy model for interacting quantum field theories and it has been intensively investigated ever since .    in low dimensional physics , the sine - gordon model often appears as a description of systems with non - quadratic interactions having a strong pining effect .",
    "contrary to the quadratic momentum that promotes fluctuations in the system , the sine - gordon potential would like to lock the model field in one of the minima of the cosine .",
    "the model is particularly useful to describe strongly correlated electronic systems in one dimension .",
    "as it is well know , interacting electrons systems in dimensions higher than @xmath0 are well described by landau s fermi liquid theory . in @xmath0",
    ", however , the fermi liquid fails due to an instability - known as peierls instability - generated by @xmath1 scattering processes which are particular to one - dimensional fermi  surfaces \" . in opposition to the fermi liquid nomenclature , one - dimensional electronic systems are generically referred to as luttinger liquids , after the related work by luttinger .",
    "@xcite    throughout the years , many models and formalisms have been proposed to describe the special behavior of luttinger liquids .",
    "of particular interest is the bosonization mapping between different luttinger liquid hamiltonians , such as the @xmath2-ology model and hubbard models , and the sine - gordon model for which plenty of anallitic results are available .    the s - matrix formalism for the sine - gordon model and the elementary excitations spectrum",
    "have been analytically derived @xcite .",
    "results for the sine - gordon model form factors @xcite and finite size correction to the model s spectrum @xcite are also available in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , there still are a number of open questions regarding the sine - gordon model .",
    "exact results for the model s correlation functions are still lacking , for example . the evaluation of the model s spectrum has proved challenging as well @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group theory is an important analitic tool is this context for it provides the understanding of the sine - gordon model s phase transition and the energy scale at which it occurs .",
    "the sine - gordon model model hamiltonian is given by @xmath3=\\int dx\\,\\left[\\,\\frac{v}{2}(\\pi^{2}+(\\partial_{x}\\varphi)^{2})-\\tilde{g}\\cos(\\beta\\varphi)\\,\\right ] \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are canonically conjugated fields , that is : @xmath6    the model lagrangean writes : @xmath7=\\int dx\\,\\{\\,\\partial_{t}\\varphi\\,.\\,\\pi\\,-\\,h[\\pi,\\varphi]\\,\\}\\ ] ] @xmath8=\\int dx\\,\\left[\\,\\frac{1}{2v}(\\partial_{t}\\varphi)^{2}-\\frac{v}{2}(\\partial_{x}\\varphi)^{2}+\\tilde{g}\\cos(\\beta\\varphi)\\,\\right ] \\label{l}\\ ] ]    after an integration by parts , the action @xmath9=\\int dt\\,l[\\varphi]\\ ] ] can be written in the following form @xmath9=\\int\\int dtdx\\,\\left[\\,\\frac{v}{2}\\varphi\\partial_{x}^{2}\\varphi-\\frac{1}{2v}\\varphi\\partial_{t}^{2}\\varphi+\\tilde{g}\\cos(\\beta\\varphi)\\,\\right]\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the @xmath10-field goes to zero at the boundaries of the integration plane .",
    "for a reason that will become clear in section iii.b , it is more convenient to work in imaginary time @xmath11 , i.e. , with the euclidean action @xmath12 which reads @xmath13=s_{0}[\\varphi]+s_{i}[\\varphi ] \\label{s}\\ ] ] @xmath14=\\int dx\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\varphi\\nabla_{x}^{2}\\varphi\\quad with\\quad\\nabla_{x}^{2}=\\partial_{x}^{2}+\\frac{1}{v^{2}}\\partial_{t}^{2 } \\label{s0}\\ ] ] @xmath15=\\int dx\\,l_{i}[\\varphi]\\quad with\\quad l_{i}[\\varphi]=g\\cos(\\beta\\varphi ) \\label{si}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the renormalization group ( r.g . ) is essentially a theory of scale invariance and symmetries . a symmetry or scale operation on a system is a transformation that portraits the system s appearance and behavior at different scales ( where this scale might be a length scale , energy , or any typical scale in the system ) .",
    "the system is said to be scale invariant under a certain scale transformation when it looks the same at all scales .    in the r.g .",
    "theory , the system s microscopic physical quantities ( such as mass , charge and interaction parameters ) do depend on the scale at which the system is observed .",
    "the scale invariant properties are the ones that emerge from the system s macroscopic structure and are related to the degree of order in the system .",
    "the global invariant properties are represented by physical quantities called order parameters .",
    "many states of matter are characterized in terms of scale invariant properties and order parameters , e.g. : the crystalline lattice structure in a solid that translates into a periodic density of particles , the spins orientation in a ferromagnetic material that results in a net spontaneous magnetization , the localization of charge in an insulator described in terms of charge density waves , and so on .",
    "when , for some reason , a scale invariant system loses its invariance it is said to have undergone a phase transition .",
    "the phase transition , i.e. the loss of invariance , takes place at a certain critical scale that is typical of each system .",
    "the critical scale defines an energy , called gap ( or mass , in quantum field theory language ) , that measures the extent of the disturbance in the system s order parameter .",
    "the phase transition s critical point is defined by the values of the system s parameters at the critical scale .",
    "as an example , picture a perfect solid at @xmath18 . as the temperature is increased , the solid will eventually lose distance invariance at some critical length scale that is set by the characteristics of the material . at this scale",
    ", the lattice correlations can not compete with the thermal fluctuations and the solid structure melts in a fluid .    here",
    ", we are interested in the scale behavior of the sine - gordon model ( or rather of a certain physical system that can be described by the sine - gordon model ) .",
    "the next three sections feature a general presentation of the r.g . procedure . in sec .",
    "b , the decomposition of a generic quantum field theory in slow and fast modes is presented ; the goal of sec .",
    "c is to express the so - called residual action that mixes slow and fast modes in terms of the theory green s function ; in sec .",
    "d , a slow modes effective action is derived through averaging out the fast modes .",
    "the last two section are dedicated to the application of the general formalism to the sine - gordon model . in sec .",
    "e , the model s effective action for the slow modes is evaluated .",
    "this effective theory is then renormalized , resulting in a re - scaled sine - gordon model .",
    "the model s flow equation are derived in sec .",
    "the r.g . procedure as it is presented in this section follows the formulation by kenneth wilson , developed in the late 60 s and which awarded him the nobel prize in 1982 .",
    "nowadays , this formulation is routinely called  wilsonian approach \" to the r.g theory .",
    "the procedure is based on splitting the theory s field @xmath19 in two components corresponding to different momentum - frequency regions of the original field s fourier decomposition . mathematically , @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    where @xmath16 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 and where @xmath28 is a momentum - frequency cutoff .    note that , in the original covariant space , the momentum - frequency shell would correspond to the unbounded surface between the two hyperbolaes @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "although this surface imposes a cutoff in the modulus @xmath31 , individually the coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 remain boundless .",
    "therefore , in the original covariant space , the integration of a function @xmath34 over the shell will diverge if @xmath34 does not decay fast enough .",
    "the purpose of the imaginary time rotation performed before eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) is exactly to avoid complications that might arise from an unbounded shell .    in a more compact form ,",

    "the result of this average is an effective action for the slow modes .",
