    "<S> [ cluster_k_cross_inclusive ] for cu+cu and au+au collisions at @xmath35 = 200  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the value found in @xmath37 = 200  gev p+p collisions , which suggests that the cluster properties are similar in p+p and a+a systems . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the phenomenological properties of hadronization appear to be similar in p+p and a+a systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also observed that the cluster size systematically decreases with increasing collision centrality in both cu+cu and au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by comparing the two systems at the same fraction of the inelastic cross section ( which is related to @xmath0 ) it appears that the cluster size scales with collision geometry of the system , e.g. the shape of the overlap region . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is unexpected since the information of clusters is extracted from pseudorapidity space and not directly connected to the transverse geometry of the system . in comparing the data with dynamical models , ampt gives the same qualitative trend as the data . </S>",
    "<S> note that the values of @xmath33 are extracted in a limited acceptance of @xmath39 , and therefore are slightly smaller than for a full acceptance measurement . </S>",
    "<S> detailed studies are underway in order to quantify this acceptance effect . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in cluster size with centrality in ampt is related to the hadronic rescattering stage . turning off hadronic processes leads to a larger cluster size in both au+au and cu+cu that is approximately invariant for all centralities .    </S>",
    "<S> further detailed studies on cluster properties have also been performed . instead of averaging over the whole @xmath38 region , </S>",
    "<S> the near- and away - side cluster size can be extracted in a limited @xmath38 range of ( @xmath40,@xmath41 ) and ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) respectively . in this restricted averaging , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 elliptic flow component again averages to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cluster_k_cross_nearaway_data ] as a function of fractional cross section for cu+cu and au+au collisions at @xmath35 = 200  gev . for the more central collisions , the away - side cluster size decreases by about 30 - 40% , whereas the near - side cluster size decreases more slowly . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior could be understood in a scenario if the medium is extremely dense and only clusters produced close to the surface can survive . then , for away - side clusters , it is more likely that part of its decay particles travel into the medium and get absorbed , resulting in the loss of away - side correlations . as for the observed collision geometry scaling of the cluster size , it might be related to the surface to volume ratio of the system . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed modeling is still being investigated to understand these phenomena . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the two - particle correlation function for inclusive charged particles has been extensively studied over a broad range in @xmath43 and @xmath38 in p+p , cu+cu and au+au collisions . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it has already been shown that the observed short - range correlations in pseudorapidity have a natural interpretation in terms of clusters . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> multiple particles are understood to be emitted close together in phase space , with a typical cluster size of 2 - 3 in p+p collisions . in the new a+a data , </S>",
    "<S> clusters have a similar size but show a non - trivial decrease in size with increasing centrality and a geometry scaling feature between cu+cu and au+au reactions . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of near- and away - side clusters provides additional information on the details of the cluster properties . </S>",
    "<S> future work will focus on model studies in order to understand the observed phenomena in heavy ion collisions . </S>"
