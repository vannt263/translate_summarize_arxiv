    "observed for the first time in 1992 microcavity polaritons@xcite  hybrid exciton - photon quasiparticles arise when quantum well ( qw ) excitons strongly couple with an electromagnetic field in a microcavity .",
    "polaritons are composite bosons and as such they are subject to bose - einstein statistics.@xcite in particular , this results in the increase in the rate of scattering to the final state which is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the population of the final state @xcite ( so - called final state stimulation ) .",
    "this phenomenon underlies the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation of microcavity polaritons@xcite and the operation of the so called polariton laser.@xcite in polariton laser , unlike photon laser , light is emitted spontaneously . however , since the emission results from the decay of identical polaritons , transferring their energy to the photons which escape from the crystal , the light is coherent and monochromatic.@xcite extensive research on microcavity polaritons from its beginning includes both : fundamental aspect in the field of many - body theories and cavity quantum electrodynamics,@xcite as well as polariton laser applications such as new sources of coherent and non classical light with extremely low energy threshold,@xcite high - speed polarization switches @xcite or sources of terahertz radiation.@xcite all of these studies and possible applications require the design and growth of structures that meet some specific criteria .",
    "one of them is a high oscillator strength of the exciton transition , a prerequisite for the light - matter strong coupling regime .",
    "also , the exciton binding energy should be large enough to ensure the operation at reasonably high temperatures and to damp dissociation of the polaritons under a strong excitation , when the density of excitons is high .",
    "finally , we note that strength of exciton - photon coupling increases with a number of qws embedded into the microcavity , since excited excitons are distributed over a greater volume , what lowers their local density .    here",
    ", we present structures that meet all of these requirements .",
    "they are made of ii - vi compounds , which ensures relatively large exciton binding energies .",
    "our design of distributed bragg reflectors ( dbr ) and the cavities materials fully eliminates any harmful stresses , enabling several identical qws to be precisely located within the cavity .",
    "in addition , it guarantees a high reproducibility of the structures , which is particularly important in studies requiring the tuning of optical properties .",
    "it should be stressed that in contrast to previous designs of te - based microcavities,@xcite in the growth process of the presented basic dbr structures no magnetic elements are used .",
    "this enables their well controlled placement inside the structures , for example in qws , which makes them especially suitable for future research on paramagnetic impurities and the influence of magnetic field on the exciton - polaritons effects .",
    "the microcavity structures presented in this work are based on ( cd , zn , mg)te layers , containing strain free qws designed and grown to meet the above - postulated properties . after presenting the structure design and the applied technology",
    ", we show the results of optical measurements which prove that the conditions for the strong coupling between cavity photons and qws excitons are achieved already in a single qw structure , and the polariton lasing regime is obtained for a structure embedding 4 qws containing manganese showing that mn ions do not destroy the strong coupling regime .",
    "the microcavity structures are grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on @xmath2 @xmath3 oriented gaas substrates .",
    "the growth temperature of the buffer and structure was @xmath4 .",
    "the dbrs are made of cd@xmath5zn@xmath6mg@xmath7te for the high refractive index layers and cd@xmath8zn@xmath9mg@xmath10te for the low refractive index layer .",
    "the different mg concentrations are obtained by using two independent mg sources @xcite .",
    "this allows for faster growth processes than growing a digital alloy in the form of a ( cd , zn)te|(cd , zn , mg)te superlattice for the low refractive index layers.@xcite the nominal thicknesses of the dbr layers are respectively @xmath11  nm and @xmath12  nm . these thicknesses result in the resonant wavelength @xmath13  nm , in resonance with the emission energy of cd@xmath14zn@xmath15te / cd@xmath5zn@xmath6mg@xmath7te qws embedded in the cavity .",
    "the _ in situ _ measurement of reflectivity at the desired resonant wavelength during the whole growth process allows for a precise control of the layer thicknesses . during the growth of the dbrs and cavity ,",
    "the sample was not rotated in order to create a wedge which gives access to exciton - photon detuning in a wide range by selection of the position on the sample ( see figs .",
    "[ 1qw ] ( a ) and [ 4qw ] ) .",
    "the key point underlying the original design of our structure is the lattice matching to mgte of the whole microcavity , including the qws @xcite .",
    "alloying cd@xmath14zn@xmath15te ( lattice matched to mgte ) with mgte allows one to easily tune the refractive index and energy gap of the layers through the mg content of the layers , keeping the lattice constant unchanged .",
    "in addition , still owing to the design of the structure , the strain induced by small deviations of the zn content in the dbr layers is negligible : a change of the zn content by @xmath16 induces a relative mismatch between the dbr layers of @xmath17 ( comparing to @xmath18 in the case of well known alas / gaas based dbr ) , which is crucial for reproducibility of the growth process .",
    "since the qws embedded in the cavity are strain free , it is possible to grow an arbitrary number of identical qws in the cavity .",
    "the two samples presented in this paper are obtained by the same growth method for the dbrs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ stem_ref ] ( e ) and fig .",
    "[ 1qw ] , the strong coupling regime is obtained with a single cd@xmath14zn@xmath15te / cd@xmath5zn@xmath6mg@xmath7te qw in a @xmath19 cavity sandwiched between two 17 fold bragg reflectors . in order to enhance the quality factor of the cavity and the coupling strength ,",
    "@xcite the second structure consists of 4(cd , zn , mn)te qws embedded in a @xmath20 cavity sandwiched between a 22 fold ( bottom dbr ) and 20 fold ( top dbr ) bragg reflectors .",
    "additional incorporation of the mn in the qws in the second structure allows us to verify that mn ions do not affect the strong coupling regime and the onset of the polariton lasing regime . as shown in fig .",
    "[ stem_ref ] ( e ) and ( f ) , the optimization of the structure resulted in an enhancement of the quality factor from @xmath21 for the single qw structure to @xmath22 for the cavity embedding 4 qws .    .",

    "as seen in the reflectivity spectra , at resonance we observe the exciton - photon mode splitting , characteristic for the strong coupling regime .",
    "[ stem_ref ] ]",
    "the samples have been characterized by reflectivity measurements in a helium continuous flow cryostat at temperature @xmath23  k. taking advantage of the structure wedge resulting from the growth procedure ( the sample was not rotated during the mbe growth ) , different points at the sample give access to various values of the exciton - photon detuning .",
    "plotting the energy positions of the polaritons as a function of the detuning allows us to determine the rabi splitting characterizing the exciton - photon coupling strength .",
    "[ 1qw ] ( a ) shows the typical exciton - cavity photon anticrossing with a rabi splitting of @xmath24 mev for the single qw microcavity .",
    "angle resolved reflectivity measurement measured in far field gives a direct access to the cavity polaritons dispersion in k - space characteristics , as shown in fig .",

    "[ 1qw ] ]    the structure containing 4 qws ( fig .",
    "[ stem_ref ] ( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) ) exhibits three polariton branches corresponding to the coupling of the cavity photon to the heavy hole and light hole exciton as shown in fig .",
    "the fit to the experimental data resulted in the determination of the coupling strength ( rabi splitting ) of the cavity photon with the heavy hole excitons and the light hole excitons ( fitting parameters ) : respectively @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 mev .",
    "mev and @xmath27 mev .",
    "photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements were performed on the sample containing 4 qws to investigate the lasing action .",
    "the cavity was non resonantly optically pumped by a ti : al@xmath28o@xmath29 laser operating in a femtosecond pulse mode , with energy tuned the first reflectivity minimum on the high energy side of the cavity stopband ( @xmath30 ev ) .",
    "[ lasing ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) shows the emission of the lower polariton for power excitations respectively below , near and above threshold : at the threshold power @xmath31 a narrow emission line appears in the spectrum and dominates at higher power excitations .",
    "the integrated pl of this emission line exhibits the typical threshold dependence on the excitation power ( fig .",
    "[ lasing ] ( d ) .",
    "this threshold is accompanied by a blueshift step due to polariton - polariton interactions and a sudden narrowing of the emission line ( ( fig .",
    "[ lasing ] ( e ) , ( f ) ) , as a signature of the increased coherence in the system .",
    "these observations are in agreement with the onset of the polariton lasing regime.@xcite the second threshold at excitation power @xmath32 visible in the energy position of the emission line , we associate to the vanishing of the strong coupling regime due to the high exciton population and the onset of the stimulated emission amplification @xcite ( photon lasing regime ) .    , we observe a blueshift step and narrowing of the emission line which is the fingerprint of the onset of polariton lasing , in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the second threshold at @xmath32 , clearly visible in the energy position , indicates the transition to the weak coupling regime and photon lasing .",
    "[ lasing ] ]",
    "the results presented above show that the conditions for polariton lasing are reached in the te - based microcavity structures we have designed . the rabi splitting obtained for the single qw structure ( @xmath25 mev ) is comparable to the one observed in the previous te - based microcavity structures @xcite or se - based microcavities .",
    "@xcite however , the original structure designed and studied here , as a result of matching its lattice constant to mgte , additionally provides a high reproducibility , a low sensitivity to strain that might be induced by zn concentration fluctuations in the deposited layers and an easy tuning of the optical properties making it very flexible and easy to operate .",
    "in addition , the absence of magnetic elements in the dbrs provides an additional degree of freedom given by the possibility to implement mn precisely in the desired element of the structure ( e.g. in the qws ) .",
    "this will enable magneto - optical studies of cavity polaritons , in which the excitonic part exhibits enhanced magneto - optical effects . in that sense , the polariton lasing regime observed in the structure containing 4 qws doped with mn is the first milestone towards such investigations . in a larger perspective ,",
    "such a microcavity structure is well suited for embedding@xcite cdte quantum dots ( qd ) with single magnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite this will be of great interest in the frame of investigations on refined effects , the development of solotronics @xcite and a preliminary step towards the strong coupling between a cavity photon and exciton in a single qd doped with a single magnetic impurity.@xcite",
    "in this work we have demonstrated for the te based microcavities containing unstrained ( cd , zn)te quantum wells the achievement of the strong coupling regime for a single qw microcavity structure and we evidence the polariton lasing regime in a structure embedding 4 qws containing magnetic ions .",
    "the material system proposed in this work combines several advantages directly resulting from its conception : ( i ) a high reproducibility of the growth process .",
    "( ii ) a low influence on strain related to zn content fluctuations from one growth process to another . both as a result of the lattice matching of ( zn , cd , mg)te based layers to mgte constituting the dbrs .",
    "( iii ) the easy tuning of the optical properties through the mg content of the dbr layers keeping the lattice constant unchanged .",
    "( iv ) the possibility of precise placement of magnetic ions in the structure free of magnetic elements enabling the study of _ semimagnetic _ polaritons .",
