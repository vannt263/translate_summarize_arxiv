    "recently , the interesting correspondence between the gravity theory in ( d+1)-dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads ) and the conformal field theory ( cft ) in d - dimensions has been elucidated using the concept of duality in the superstring theory @xcite .",
    "the microscopic derivation of the black hole entropy has also been studied extensively to apply the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    in several works of particular interest , it has been shown that the einstein theory of gravity in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional anti - de sitter space is equivalent to the chern - simons gauge theory @xcite , while black hole entropy has been studied in terms of its asymptotic symmetry @xcite . the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity theory is a simple toy model that possesses no local or physical modes ( like gravitational wave modes ) , but it does possess interesting global and topological modes .",
