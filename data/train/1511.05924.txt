    "the recent environmental health research has revealed that the associations between air pollution exposures and health outcomes vary spatially because the local environmental factors including topography , climate , and air pollutant constituents are heterogeneous across a broad area ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". however , the current available region definition ( e.g. the 48 states of the continental u.s . ) can not ensure homogeneous intra - region exposure - health - outcome association ( eha ) .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to identify a set of disjoint regions exhibiting similar within - region ehas and distinct between - region ehas in a data - driven fashion ( automatic rather than predefined region map ) .",
    "the statistical inferences based on the automatic detected regions ( e.g. eha regression analysis ) can provide important guidance for environmental health research .",
    "motivated by analyzing a data set from the national data base of annual air pollution exposures and cardiovascular disease mortality rates for 3100 counties in the u.s . during the 2000s ( more details are provided in section 4 ) , we aim to estimate the spatially varying associations between air pollution exposures and health outcomes across different regions .",
    "the region level inferences may reveal local environmental changes and latent confounders that could influence local population health .",
    "however , most current spatial statistical models ( for areal data analysis ) are limited for this purpose because few of them allow data - driven allocation of counties into contiguous regions ( that different regions demonstrate distinct health risks ) . in our analysis , we use county as the basic spatial unit because the health outcome data is aggregated at the county level , yet the proposed approach could be applied for analysis with any basic spatial unit ( e.g. zip code ) .",
    "the most popular modeling strategy for areal spatial data has been through the conditionally autoregressive ( car ) distribution and its variants.(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in disease mapping",
    ", a random effect model is often employed to link the disease rate with exposures , and the random residuals and random slopes are used to account for spatial dependence via car or multivariate car ( mcar ) priors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the random residuals and slopes could improve goodness - of - fit by explaining more proportion of variance , the inferences on the regression coefficients ( main effects ) are still limited to one value for the whole nation(@xcite ) .",
    "the spatial dependency information is incorporated into statistical modeling by using a spatial adjacency matrix @xmath0 where @xmath1 if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are adjacent neighbors and otherwise @xmath4 .",
    "it has been recognized that the spatial adjacency may not necessarily lead to similar random effects because health outcomes related factors such as landscape types ( e.g. urban area and forest ) or sociodemographic factors ( e.g. income levels ) could be distinct between neighbors .",
    "@xcite propose a bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to detect county boundaries by using boundary likelihood value ( blv ) based on the posterior distributions , yet the detected boundary segments are often disconnected ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath5 norm car prior has also been applied to account for abrupt changes between neighbors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite further include the random effect for the boundary edges with ising priors and identify more connected boundary segments .",
    "although the boundaries can provide information of adjacent but distinct neighbors , they may not allow to define distinct regions due to the discontinuity of boundary edges .",
    "it is also worth to note that the boundaries are often defined based on the outcomes ( or residuals ) rather than the disease - exposure associations ( regression coefficients ) .    to fill this gap , we present an automatic region - wise spatially varying coefficient method to recognize and estimate the spatially varying associations between air pollution exposures and health outcomes in automatically detected regions for environmental health data , and we name it as region - wise automatic regression ( rar ) model . rather than focusing on modeling the spatial random effects",
    ", the rar model aims to parcellate the whole spatial space into a set of disjoint regions with distinct associations , and then to estimate the association for each disjoint region .",
    "we implement the rar model in three steps : first , we assess the initial difference of associations by examining each spatial unit s impact on the overall regression coefficient based on @xmath6 ; second , based on the initial difference of the associations , we cluster the all spatial units into a set of spatially contiguous regions by using image segmentation technique ; last , we estimate the associations for each region , and we account for the within region spatial correlation of the residuals .",
    "we also develop a likelihood based optimization strategy for parameter selection .",
    "our main contribution is first to provide a statistical model to identify the data - driven definition of regions exhibiting differential regression coefficients that may yield significant public health impact .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe rar model and its three step estimation procedure . in section 3 ,",
    "we conduct simulation studies with the known truth to examine the performance of the rar model and to compare it with existing methods . in section 4 , we apply the proposed method to a environmental health dataset on investigating the association between pm 2.5 and cardiovascular disease mortality rate in the u.s .. we conclude the paper with discussions in section 5 .",
    "we use a graph model @xmath7 to denote the spatial data , where the vertex set @xmath8 represents all spatial units ( e.g. counties ) in the space / map and the edge set @xmath9 delineates the similarity between the vertices . for rar model , @xmath10 reflects the similarity between the eha of spatial units @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we introduce the three steps of rar model : 1 ) to assess the spatial association affinity between spatial units ( @xmath13 ) ; 2 ) to parcellate graph @xmath14 into @xmath15 regions that @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the spatial units within one region @xmath18 exhibit coherent coefficients ; and 3 ) to estimate the region - specific eha . for notational simplicity",
    ", we only consider cross - sectional study modeling though it is straightforward to extend the rar method to longitudinal studies .      to assess the association between health outcomes and covariates ,",
    "a poisson regression model is often used : @xmath20    where @xmath21 is death count and @xmath22 is age - adjusted expected population count for county @xmath2 , and @xmath23 are covariates of potential confounders besides the air pollution exposure .",
    "if the association between air pollution exposure and health outcome at the location @xmath2 deviates from the general trend , then the regression coefficient excluding location @xmath2 @xmath24 will be distinct from the general regression coefficient of all observations @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we adopt dfbetas to measure the eha deviation for location @xmath2 .",
    "we denote @xmath26 as the deviation of spatial unit @xmath2 : @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the design matrix including both pm2.5 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 is weight matrix ( @xmath30 is the identity matrix if no weight is assigned ) , @xmath31 is the leverage , @xmath32 is the standardized pearson residual , @xmath33 is the estimated standard deviation of @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that [ eq : dfbeta ] is a one - step approximation to the difference for a generalized linear model ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the similarity of the associations between two spatially adjacent units @xmath2 and @xmath3 are calculated by a distance metric ( e.g. gaussian similarity function ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the standard deviation across all @xmath26 , and @xmath37 is the indicator function which equals 1 only when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are spatially adjacent .",
    "in addition , if the natural cubic splines are used to fit the nonlinear trend of the air pollution exposure ( @xcite ) , then @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the range of @xmath13 is from 0 to 1 .",
    "the similarity matrix @xmath9 is a @xmath39 matrix , which is equal to @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 is hadamard product ) .",
    "thus , matrix @xmath9 fuses information of pm2.5 exposure ( along with other covariates ) and health outcomes in @xmath43 with spatial adjacency information @xmath0 .",
    "the goal of step two is to identify the disjoint and contiguous regions ( @xmath16 ) such that the eha of the spatial units are homogeneous within each @xmath18 but distinct between @xmath18 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the contiguity requires that @xmath46 vertex in @xmath18 , there exists at least one vertex @xmath3 which is connected to @xmath2 .",
    "then the region detection becomes a graph segmentation problem based on the similarity matrix @xmath9 .",
    "we aim to estimate a set of binary segmentation binary parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 that parcellate @xmath14 into @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the segmentation model aims to estimate the latent binary parameters : @xmath50 with the contiguity constraint , where @xmath51 is the neighborhood of edge @xmath13 .",
    "one way to circumvent this is to identify the @xmath52 for those @xmath53 in @xmath9 ( which is analogous to  cutting \" edges in the graph ) with the optimization that :    @xmath54    where @xmath15 is the number of disjoint sets and @xmath55 is the sum of a set of edge weights ( with @xmath53 and @xmath52 ) to isolate the subgraph @xmath18 from @xmath14 .",
    "however , even for a planary graph g and @xmath56 parcellation , the optimization is np complex .",
    "to solve the objective function in [ eq : cut ] , a two step relaxation procedure is often used .",
    "the first step is a continuous relaxation :    @xmath57    where l is the normalized graph laplacian matrix with @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 is a @xmath61 coordinate matrix ( all entries are continuous ) that places the close nodes ( based on the adjacency matrix @xmath9 ) near to each other in @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) is the @xmath66th vector ( @xcite ) . by rayleigh quotient ,",
    "@xmath67 are the first @xmath15 eigen - vectors of spectral decomposition of @xmath68 ( with ascending order of eigen - values ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the unnormalized graph laplacian matrix @xmath69 is also often used ( @xcite ) . from the spectral graph theory point of view",
    ", the bayesian car model updates the random effect ( @xmath70 ) posterior sampling by using the heuristic to increase the fusion of likelihood and the objective function in [ eq : relaxation1 ] which is equivalent to minimizing unnormalized graph laplacian matrix ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore , the car prior can be considered as a penalty ( restriction ) term that aligns with the spectral clustering objective function .",
    "the second step of the automatic region detection procedure is discretization relaxation that produces @xmath71 which is a @xmath61 binary matrix with all entries either 0 or 1 and @xmath72 .",
    "then , objective function becomes    @xmath73    which is equivalent to [ eq : cut ] .",
    "the second step optimization aims to calibrates the @xmath71 coordinate matrix with reference to @xmath67 . to implement this optimization step , @xcite and @xcite apply",
    "k - means clustering algorithms for the distretization relaxation .",
    "however , the k - means clustering algorithm results may vary due to different random initialization and yield unstable results . @xcite",
    "develop multiclass spectral clustering algorithm which is robust to random initialization and nearly global - optimal .",
    "the optimization yields results of the automatic region detection , and based on @xmath71 all spatial units are categorized to @xmath15 class with contiguity .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 can be obtained from the resulting @xmath71 , and under mild regularity condition the spectral clustering based region segmentation estimator is consistent that is @xmath75 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly summarize the algorithm in appendix and refer the readers to the original paper for the detailed optimization algorithm .    as a comparison",
    ", the popular bayesian car model leverages the second line of formula [ eq : reg ] @xmath76 and imposes areal random intercept @xmath77 linked with the spatial adjacency matrix @xmath0 by letting @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is a positive scale parameter , @xmath0 is the spatial adjacency matrix introduced in section 1 , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , and @xmath82 is chosen to ensure @xmath83 non - singular .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath84 is a proper car distribution when @xmath85 .",
    "when implementing the mcmc for a bayesian car model , the chain updating criteria incorporate both the likelihood part @xmath86 and the car prior @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter update rule in part favors smaller @xmath88 values , i.e. the spatially adjacent @xmath89 and @xmath90 have similar values .",
    "interestingly , the prior function is intrinsically linked with the objective function of spectral clustering algorithm which aims to minimize @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is unnormalized graph laplacian matrix when @xmath93 and @xmath94 is discretized @xmath61 ( n nodes and k classes ) matrix to represent the cluster membership that @xmath95 and @xmath96(@xcite ) . using our similarity matrix @xmath9 as @xmath0",
    ", @xmath97 is smaller when the spatially adjacent units with similar dfbetas are classified into one spatial cluster . with similar objective functions ,",
    "@xmath94 could be obtained by discretizing @xmath70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , both the car and rar model incorporate spatial adjacency in a close format of the updating criteria and objective function . yet , as the random effects ( residuals or the random slopes ) @xmath70 in the car model are continuous , they could not provide region parcellation information to identify regions with distinct eha as the rar model does .      provided with the automatic region parcellation results @xmath16",
    ", we estimate the region / subgraph specific association between air - pollution exposure and health outcomes . the straightforward method is to conduct stratified analysis such that within each @xmath18 , the glm",
    "is estimated :    @xmath98    within each @xmath18 , we further investigate the spatial dependence of the residuals by using semivariogram or moran s i statistic .",
    "if the residuals of the spatially close units are dependent with each other , then the spatial autoregressive models such as car and sar can be applied for regression analysis .",
    "alternatively , a glm could be applied to fit all spatial units by using the region indicator as a categorical covariate and adding the interaction terms of the categorical region indicators and the air pollution exposure .    in light of the law of parsimony",
    ", we aim to maximize the likelihood with constraint of model complexity and apply the commonly used model selection criteria bic to determine the appropriate number of @xmath15 .",
    "particularly , the bic value is a function of number of regions ( @xmath15 ) , and lower bic implies appropriate number of regions .",
    "we conduct a set of simulations to demonstrate the performance of rar and compare it with conventional spatial statistical methods including sar and car models .",
    "we first generate a map of spatial units from three distinct regions by letting @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "we assume that there are three distinct associations @xmath102 for the three different regions .",
    "then , we simulate the covariates @xmath103 and residuals @xmath104 , for example , we let @xmath105 .",
    "we further apply gaussian kernel to smooth the residuals to reflect the spatial dependency .",
    "then , the dependent variable follows @xmath106 .",
    "the input data are observations of @xmath107 for @xmath99 and the region parcellation is unknown .",
    "we illustrate the data simulation and model fitting procedure in figure [ fig : rs ] .",
    "we simulate 100 data sets at three of the noise levels ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ) .",
    "we apply the rar method to analyze the simulated data sets and compare it to the car model and sar model .",
    "we evaluate the performance of different methods by using the criteria of the bias and 95% ci coverage of @xmath34 across the 100 simulated data sets , and the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we note that though some smoothing effects are observed at the boundaries , the transitions are fairly well recaptured .",
    "we do not include the bayesian car spatially varying coefficient model ( e.g. @xcite ) because it yields different regression coefficient for each location @xmath2 , and it is not available for the comparison of region level @xmath34 .",
    "the results show that without region parcellation to account for the spatially varying coefficients , the eha estimation could be vastly biased by using conventional spatial data analysis methods .",
    "in addition , rar model seems not to be affected by the noise levels .",

    "the mapping of disease and further building environment - health / disease association have long been a key aspect of public health research .",

    "most previous methods employ random effect model by letting each spatial unit have a random slope and borrow power from neighbors , which is advantageous with regard to improving model fitting and model variance explanation .",
    "but , it is also beneficial to provide a map of regions that is defined by eha similarity because it would allow us to directly draw statistical inferences at the region level as main effects may vary spatially(which is our major motivation to develop the rar method ) .",

    "the region - wise eha inferences provide important guidance for public health decision making .",
    "for instance , although the exposure levels at california and ohio river valley are high , the eha of these two regions are not among the highest associations .",
    "thus , the rar model could provide the informative geographic parcellations and inferences that neither exposure or health status data alone can exhibit ( e.g figure 2 ) .",
    "clustering and cluster analysis have been widely applied in spatial data analysis ( @xcite )",
    ". however , the most methods are limited to provide disjoint and contiguous regions with distinct disease exposure associations .",
    "the regions with different associations may suggest some unidentified confounders and other public health or geographic / environmental factors affecting population health .",
