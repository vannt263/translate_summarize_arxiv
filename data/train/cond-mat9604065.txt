    "statistical mechanical approaches were successful for investigation of equilibrium properties of associative memories or attractor networks .",
    "the hopfield model @xcite@xcite which updates its state asynchronously was investigated from statistical mechanical point of view by amit _",
    "et al _ @xcite@xcite , and a lot of interesting features were found .",
    "one of the main issues about the hopfield model as an associative memory device is the critical storage capacity .",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that the hebbian learning in the hopfield model leads to the optimal storage capacity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of embedded patterns and @xmath2 is the number of neurons .",
    "fontanari and k@xmath3berle @xcite extended the method of amit _ et al _ to the synchronous networks and showed that the capacity remains the same @xmath4 and derived finite - temperature properties of synchronous networks .",
    "on the other hand , we can not obtain information on the dynamical process of retrieval by equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "amari and maginu @xcite proposed a signal - to - noise ratio analysis to investigate the dynamical properties of synchronous networks .",
    "they divided time - dependent local field @xmath5 into a signal part @xmath6 , which corresponds to the first ( @xmath7 ) term in the summation over @xmath8 , and a noise contribution @xmath9 corresponding to the rest ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "they assumed that the time - dependent noise term obeys the gaussian distribution during the dynamical processes and showed that the capacity is @xmath11 .",
    "nishimori and ozeki @xcite pointed out by monte - carlo simulations that the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the noise term is valid at least within statistical uncertainties if the final retrieval is successful . and they extended the amari - maginu theory to the network which updates its state stochastically and investigated the properties of the hopfield network at finite temperatures .",
    "the phase diagram obtained as the equilibrium limit of the extended amari - maginu dynamics is very similar to the phase diagram of amit _ et al _ @xcite@xcite .",
    "the limitation of storing patterns in hopfield networks comes mainly from the hebbian interactions @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , gardner @xcite @xcite @xcite showed , in her pioneering papers , that the optimal storage capacity @xmath13 is @xmath14 for the general interaction @xmath15 .",
    "many attempts have been made to increase the storage capacity of the hopfield model to gardner s limit @xmath16 by taking more complex synapses .",
    "recently zertuche _ et al _ @xcite studied the storage capacity of the hopfield model with state - dependent synapses by introducing a threshold parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this parameter @xmath17 determines which patterns contribute to the synapses .",
    "this synapse can be written as @xmath18 . in their model , only patterns whose correlation with the state of the networks is greater or equal to the threshold are left finite to give a hebbian contribution to the synapses .",
    "the capacity of the hopfield network with this type of synapses is found to increase @xmath13 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 at @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "nishimori and opris @xcite investigated the retrieval properties of an associative memory with a general transfer function using the extended amari - maginu theory @xcite .",
    "they obtained the optimal storge capacity for the non - monotonic transfer function by taking the equilibrium limit of the recursion relation of the amari - maginu dynamics and showed that networks with non - monotonic transfer functions yield an enhanced memory capacity than the conventional monotonic relation .",
    "this property of non - monotonic neural networks was also pointed out by morita _",
    "et al _ @xcite by monte - carlo simulation before nishimori and opris @xcite .",
    "the reason why the optimal storage capacity of non - monotonic transfer function increases is that a weak value of the total input to a neuron implies a confused state and an inverted output for a weak input might works as a trial toward an improved retrieval .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the retrieval phase diagram of hopfield networks which update asynchronously and have a non - monotonic transfer function by a mean - field theory of statistical mechanics proposed by geszti @xcite@xcite . in section 2",
    "we show the formulation of the mean - field approximation to the asynchronous hopfield networks with a non - monotonic transfer function and equation of state are derived . in section 3",
    "we extend our formulation to the networks with a general type of transfer function . in section 4",
    "we study the performance of non - monotonic hopfield networks when their synapses depend on the state of networks using the method proposed by zertuche _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in section 5 we compare the results of our calculations with the results obtained by nishimori and opris @xcite .",
    "most of the investigations which discussed equilibrium properties of fully - connected hopfield networks by statistical mechanics were restricted to networks with equilibrium free energy . in order to show the existence of such a free energy ,",
    "we must make it sure that the synaptic couplings are symmetric and the transfer function is monotonic .",
    "our model in this paper has symmetric couplings , but the transfer function is non - monotonic . in order to overcome this difficulty we use the mean - field approximation as follows .",

    "this non - monotonic transfer function reduces to the form in figure 1 in the limit @xmath36 . then equation ( 4 )",

    "@xmath13 approaches the monotonic value ( 0.138 in the present case ) in the limit @xmath68 .",
