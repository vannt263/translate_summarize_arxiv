    "indeed , the uncertainty in the parameters and the suppositions introduced in the model does not allow one to precisely ensure the impurity charge , with the screening probably reducing its effective value to less than an electron charge .",

    "is applied to remove frequency components higher than a prescribed threshold @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "firstly , we will analyze the controllability of a symmetrical dqd in a clean sample .",
    "the absence of impurities means that the only relevant potentials are those from the confining wells .",
    "then , the electronic ground state , @xmath83 , is spatially delocalized , with a high density around each dot . the first and second excited states , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , have very close energies , what allows one to define the doubly occupied states at the left and right dots as @xmath86 $ ] .",

    "if the sample were heavily doped , that is , it has a high impurity density or their charges are high ( i.e. , comparable to the electron charge ) the system is far from being controllable .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the situation where the density of impurities is low , such that no more than one of them is in the neighbourhood of the dqd .",
    "we also assume that their charge @xmath5 is small , characterized by an effective parameter @xmath96 ( meaning that it is highly screened ) , a range which has been considered suitable in a previous work @xcite .",
    "[ yield - z ] shows the calculated yield obtained when the pulse optimized for the transition @xmath97 in the clean dqd , is applied to the doped dqd having a coulomb point charge @xmath5 located at the mid point between both quantum dots .",
    "[ yield - z ] shows that for ultrashort pulses of a few picoseconds , even very small impurity charges can heavily deteriorate the performance of the optimal pulse .",
    "the unintentional impurities act as trapping centers for the electrons , spoiling the fast operation of the pulses optimally designed for the clean device .    in the next section we propose and discuss a protocol for controlling the electronic states using oct in order to avoid the deterioration introduced by a charge impurity located in between the dots .",
    "( color online ) calculated yields for pulses of @xmath98 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ps as a function of the magnitude of the effective charge @xmath99 of an impurity localized in the middle of the dots .",
    "the pulses were optimized for the double quantum dot without impurity , with a fluence of @xmath100 mv@xmath95/nm@xmath95 , and applied to the system containing the coulomb impurity .",
    "the yield is nearly @xmath101 for @xmath102 , but it becomes strongly deteriorated even for small values of @xmath99 . ]",
    "although the oct pulses produce fast transitions between localized and delocalized states in a clean dqd , with high fidelity , they fail after adding a coulomb charge .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the presence of the charge , the spatial distribution of the electron wave function of the system is not only localized around the qds , but also in the proximity of the center of the coulomb potential .",
    "nevertheless , for a proper operation and detection of the electron charges in the qds ( e.g. , using quantum point contacts ) it is desirable that both the initial and target qubit states correspond to electron densities predominantly localized around the qds .",
    "our proposed protocol consists in using oct for tailoring two pulses , to be sequentially applied , in order to induce the transitions @xmath103 .",
    "firstly , an _ initialization _ pulse is designed for the transition @xmath104 , i.e. , a pulse by which the electrons initially in the ground state of the hamiltonian with the impurity ( @xmath105 ) are set in the ground state of the hamiltonian without impurity ( @xmath106 ) . immediately afterwards , the second pulse drives the wave function to perform the same transition as in the clean system , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "this second pulse has all the previously discussed advantages of fast and high - fidelity evolution , and correspond to the desired _ qubit operation _",
    ", e.g. , for information processing .",
    "the influence of the impurity charge could , in principle , spoil and slow down the whole process because it enters in two ways : ( i ) the initialization pulse introduces an additional evolution time to set the wave function in the state @xmath108 . as a consequence , the operation of the device with an impurity , performed between the same pair of states , will be necessarily slower than without impurities present , and the fidelity , for a fixed pulse duration , could depend strongly on @xmath99 ; ( ii ) although the operation pulse produces a transition between impurity - free states @xmath108 and @xmath109 , they are to be represented in terms of states of the whole hamiltonian as @xmath110 , with coefficients depending on the charge @xmath99",
    ". we shall show in the following , however , that none of these circumstances eliminates the advantages of the procedure , which holds a high fidelity with operation times lesser than the typical dephasing times .",
    "we consider three different values for the charge of the impurity , namely , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , corresponding to the conditions of weak and intermediate strength of the coulomb potential competing with the confining ones in the qds .",
    "firstly , we calculated pulses by optimizing them without imposing any restriction on the maximum allowed frequency . as a result ,",
    "the yield increases monotonically with the fluence until reaching a plateau having a maximum value of 99.9% for @xmath111 and 99.4% for @xmath114 .",
    "these maximum yields are reached nearly at @xmath115 mv@xmath95/nm@xmath95 . on the other hand ,",
    "when a cut - off frequency @xmath82 is imposed , the increase in the yield is similar until the aforementioned value of fluence .",
    "nevertheless , instead of the plateaus of the unconstrained pulses , the yield of frequency - constrained pulses reaches a top and then oscillates , with a slight decrease in average .",
    "remarkably , the use of a cut - off frequency @xmath116 thz , compatible with current experimental capabilities , affects more strongly the yield of the systems with smaller impurity charges .",
    "this behaviour can be attributed to the fact that , for low fluence pulses , the electron can only be promoted to the low - lying levels having small excitation energy . on the other hand ,",
    "pulses of larger fluence entail a larger amplitude and excitation energies to higher states .",
    "while the unconstrained pulses have a suitable frequency composition to produce the excitation to the higher levels , the frequency constrained pulses do not have the higher frequency required to excite the electrons to the higher levels . therefore ,",
    "some transitions involving highly excited states are inhibited , leading to a decrease in the yield . in other words , for systems with a large impurity charge , its electronic structure is mainly determined by the lowest lying ( i.e. , by the low frequency or low excitation energy ) states of the coulomb potential .",
    "therefore , in such cases , both pulses , with and without cut - off , are almost equally well suited for producing the maximum yield which , nevertheless , becomes smaller than for small impurity charges .",

    "it can be shown that the effect of the addition of a one - electron operator to the hubbard hamiltonian ( such as the coulomb potential of the charged impurity or the electric field of the controlling laser ) is accounted for by a change in the hopping parameter @xmath195 , with @xmath196 for the coulomb charge one - electron operator .",

    "those transitions give rise to changes of the electron charge in the individual dots , which can be detected , thus experimentally realizing a charge qubit .",
    "the resulting fast and high - fidelity tailored pulses are able to operate the qubit in times of the order of 10 ps , shorter than the decoherence time in clean samples , but their fidelity deteriorates heavily when even small coulomb charges are present in the system .",
    "therefore , we proposed and assessed the performance of applying a two - step protocol , by firstly initializing the electronic states in the ground state of the system without impurities , such that it compensates the changes in the electronic structure suffered by the dqd , introduced by the coulomb charge .",
    "the second pulse operates the qubit as if it were impurity - free .",
    "since both steps are designed in terms of the real electronic structure of the charged qubit , we have also analyzed the influence of the charge @xmath99 on the electronic states of the double quantum dots .",
    "we have found that the complete two - step protocol involves mainly the lowest lying energy levels and remains fast enough to drive the states to the desired target state with a high fidelity , compatible with the requirements for its use in information processing tasks .",
