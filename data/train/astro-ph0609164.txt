    "this paper examines the collisional dynamics of differentially rotating , particulate disks , and addresses specifically the intrinsic mechanisms which might induce the generation of irregular , fine - scale structure , such as that exhibited by saturn s b - ring .",
    "_ voyager _ , and _ cassini _ more recently , revealed that these essentially axisymmetric variations appear on a very wide range of length - scale from the limit of resolution ( @xmath0 100 m ) to several hundred kilometres ( horn and cuzzi 1995 , porco _ et al .",
    "though some proportion of b - ring structure may be caused by non - dynamical effects such as variations in albedo and phase function- see cuzzi and estrada 1996 , for example ) and from gravitational interactions with neighbouring satellites ( thiessenhusen _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , it is believed that the majority corresponds to changes in optical thickness resulting from a collective dynamics ( tremaine 2003 ) .",
    "this work studies _ dilute _ particulate systems , and as such may not be directly applicable to the saturnian rings .",
    "it is nevertheless an informative first stop before we embark on the challenging stability analysis of a dense granular gas .",
    "other than presenting a general framework in which such a calculation can be tackled , the dilute gas formalism permits us to isolate analytically the interesting effects of anisotropy and non - newtonian viscous stress upon the local axisymmetric instabilities thought to be manifest in planetary rings .",
    "since _ voyager _ first reported the radial stratification of saturn s rings , theoreticians have advocated a number of possible causes .",
    "these have included : ballistic transport ( durisen 1995 ) , electromagnetic effects ( goertz and morfill 1988 ) , and interleaved shearing and shear - free zones ( tremaine 2003 ) .",
    "others have looked to the local instabilities of viscous fluid disks , interpreting the disordered state observed as the saturated endpoint of their nonlinear evolution .",
    "the ` viscous instability ' was the first proposed ( lin and bodenheimer 1981 , ward 1981 , and lukkari 1981 ) .",
    "essentially a monotonic ` clumping ' , it is associated with an outward angular momentum flux which decreases with surface density : @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is kinematic viscosity and @xmath3 surface mass density ) . though a dilute ring s viscosity depends on optical depth in a manner which promises the existence of such an instability ( goldreich and tremaine 1978 , shu and stewart 1985 ) , saturn s rings are most likely ` dense ' , and theoretical and numerical n - body studies",
    "have revealed that such rings do not manifest the appropriate viscosity for this instability to develop ( araki and tremaine 1986 , and wisdom and tremaine 1988 ) .",
    "the ` viscous overstability ' was first examined in the context of accretion disks by kato ( 1978 ) , and , as the name suggests , originates in overcompensation by the system s restoring forces : the stress oscillation which accompanies the epicyclic response in an acoustic - inertial wave will force the system back to equilibrium so strongly that it will ` overshoot ' .",
    "the mechanism relies on : a ) the synchronisation of the viscous stress s oscillations with those of density , and b ) the viscous stress increasing sufficiently in the compressed phase . in hydrodynamics",
    "only the latter consideration is relevant , which furnishes the criterion for overstability : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a number dependent on the thermal properties of the ring ( schmit and tscharnuter 1995 ) .",
    "the viscous overstability has been a favoured explanation for smaller scale b - ring structure in recent years , a status stemming , primarily , from the viscosity profiles computed by araki and tremaine s 1986 dense gas model and wisdom and tremaine s 1988 particle simulations .",
    "both appear to satisfy the above criterion .",
    "consequently the linear behaviour of the instability has been thoroughly examined , though only within a hydrodynamic framework ( schmit and tscharnuter 1995 , spahn _ et .",
    "_ 2000 , and schmidt _ et al .",
    "in addition , schmidt and salo ( 2003 ) have constructed a weakly nonlinear theory , and the overstability s long - term , nonlinear behaviour has been numerically studied by schmit and tscharnuter ( 1999 ) .",
    "an isothermal model was adopted in both cases .",
    "0.3 cm    however , fluid mechanics is only one of several theoretical approaches thathave been deployed to capture the behaviour of planetary rings : n - body simulations , generalisations of stellar dynamics , and kinetic theory .",
    "this plurality is surely indicative of how the field of planetary ring dynamics falls uncomfortably between the more familiar frameworks of classical physics .",
    "our analysis will predominantly focus upon the kinetic approach , and solve the set of moment equations derived from the kinetic theories proposed in shu and stewart 1985 ( hereafter referred to as ` ss85 ' ) and in goldreich and tremaine 1978 ( referred to as ` gt78 ' ) .",
    "these formalisms have hitherto been used mainly to establish equilibrium solutions .",
    "this paper goes the next step by exploring their linear theory .",
    "such an analysis is more involved than the analogous hydrodynamic calculation ; however , the latter s adoption of the navier - stokes stress model introduces two assumptions which may be inappropriate in the ring context and whose consequences are instructive to investigate .",
    "firstly , the navier - stokes model presumes the distribution of the particles velocity dispersion to be nearly isotropic . in the regime of many collisions per orbit",
    "this is an acceptable supposition , as collisions scatter particles randomly on the average .",
    "however if the collision rate , @xmath6 , is of the same order as the orbital frequency , @xmath7 , ( as it is presumed to be in saturn s rings ) this need not be true .",
    "secondly , hydrodynamics assumes an ` instantaneous ' ( local in time ) relationship between stress and strain .",
    "this may not hold when @xmath8 .",
    "generally the viscous stress possesses a relaxation time of order @xmath9 , which in this regime will be comparable to the dynamic time scale .",
    "thus the immediate history of the stress can not be ignored .",
    "its inclusion should have the most impact on the stability of oscillating modes , especially the overstability , it depending on the synchronisation of the stress and density oscillations .",
    "a kinetic model can address both issues , accounting for anisotropy within an appropriate collision term and providing a straightforward way , by the taking of moments , to generate dynamical equations for the viscous stress .",
    "another advantage is that a kinetic model lets us explicitly include the microphysics of particle - particle interactions and thence to potentially model a larger set of the physical mechanisms at play ( such as collisions , irregular surfaces , spin , size distribution , etc ) .",
    "it also narrows the scope of our simplifying assumptions to the particulars of collisions between spheres of ice , which have been observed in the laboratory ( see bridges _",
    "_ 1984 , hatzes _",
    "_ 1988 , amongst others ) .",
    "0.3 cm the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we present a brief derivation of the set of closed , vertically averaged moment equations in a local model , the shearing sheet , for a general kinetic equation .",
    "we then specialise to the ss85 kinetic model and briefly exhibit its equilibrium characteristics .",
    "section 3 contains the linear theory of a general kinetic equation and proves results pertaining to self - gravity and the thermal modes when in the limit of length - scales much longer than the disk height .",
    "we then derive stability criteria for the viscous instability and overstability specific to the ss85 model .",
    "comparisons with an analogous calculation for a hydrodynamic model and the gt78 model are performed in sections 4 and 5 . in the former",
    "we isolate the effects of non - newtonian stress on the linear theory , and in the latter observe how the ss85 collision term approximates satisfactorily that of the more accurate triaxial gaussian model .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the formulation of a suitable kinetic theory poses a number of difficulties , namely the closure of the moment hierarchy and the simplification of the collision term .",
    "but the various approximations these require by no means cripple the approach .",
    "the most fundamental assumption we make is that our ring is composed exclusively of hard , identical , and indestructible spheres .",
    "in addition we presume that the particles are non - spinning .",
    "these simplifications render the mathematics convenient ( but see stewart _",
    "_ 1984 and shu and stewart 1985 for justifications) now the inelasticity of the collisions is quantified solely by the normal coefficient of restitution , @xmath10 , which is the ratio of the normal relative speed after and before a collision .",
    "it is generally a function of normal impact velocity , @xmath11 , and possibly other parameters like ambient temperature and pressure , particle size and mass ( hatzes _ et al . _ 1988 , dilley 1993 ) .",
    "a number of laboratory experiments have been conducted in order to ascertain the collisional properties of ice spheres in saturnian conditions , in particular the relationship between the coefficient of restitution and @xmath12 ( see bridges _ et al . _ 1984 , hatzes _ et al . _ 1988 , supulver _ et al . _ 1995 , and dilley and crawford 1996 ) . excepting dilley , these authors successfully fit a step - wise power law to their data for collisions sufficiently gentle and/or surfaces sufficiently frosted : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are parameters contingent on the material properties of the ice balls and their ambient environment .",
    "bridges data admit @xmath16 and @xmath17 cm s@xmath18 for frosted particles of radius 2.5 cm at a temperature of 210k ( significantly higher than the appropriate conditions ) .",
    "hatzes finds @xmath19 and @xmath20 cm s@xmath18 for the case of frosted particles at 123k ( however , for the case of smoother particles an exponential law provides a better fit ) . at slightly lower temperatures ( @xmath21100k )",
    "supulver _ et al .",
    "_ obtain @xmath22 and @xmath23 cm s@xmath18 with their torsional pendulum fixed .",
    "though the functional relationship is useful , the coefficient of restitution varies considerably as the physical condition of the contact surface is more or less frosty or sublimated , as hatzes _",
    "also the neglect of spin , the effects of glancing collisions , irregularly shaped surfaces , coagulation and erosion , mass transfer and the role of amorphous ice , further emphasises the simplicity of the collision model adopted .",
    "studies of those processes we omit are found in salo 1987 , araki 1991 and morishima and salo 2006 ( theory and simulations ) , and in mcdonald _",
    "_ 1989 , hatzes _",
    "_ 1991 , supulver _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 and supulver _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ( experiments ) .",
    "from this point on we denote by @xmath10 the _ averaged _ coefficient of restitution , which is a function of the macroscopic variable , @xmath24 , the velocity dispersion . for a general step - wise power law and a maxwellian velocity distribution , it is straightforward to obtain an analytic expression for @xmath10 averaged over collisions .",
    "its functional dependence on @xmath24 is , unsurprisingly , the ` smoothed ' analogue of eq.s piecewise dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "the rings we study are _",
    "dilute_. we realise this curtails the applicability of our results considerably as saturn s rings , even the optically thin regions , are thought to exhibit important dense effects .",
    "araki and tremaine ( 1986 ) revealed significant collisional contributions to the kinetic equilibrium when collisions are sufficiently inelastic ; and the experimentally derived elasticity laws of predict collisions are dissipative enough for this ` cold ' regime to be widespread in saturn s rings , given appropriate particle sizes ( see marouf _",
    "_ 1983 and zebker _ et al _ 1985 ) .",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed by particle simulations , wisdom and tremaine 1988 and salo 1991 the most notable .",
    "moreover , both simulations and theoretical models show that the dynamics of small particles ( for which nonlocal effects are less important ) strongly couple to the dynamics of the largest particles ( for which nonlocal effects _ are _ important ) , both in two size systems and in polydisperse disks exhibiting power - law size distributions akin to saturn s ( see stewart _",
    "_ 1984 , salo 1987 , lukkari 1989 , salo 1991 , and salo 1992b ) .",
    "physically then , a dilute model best describes planetary rings in which the radii of the largest particles are of the order of centimetres , or tens of centimetres .",
    "estimates on the maximum size of particle radius are easy to establish from the dilute theory , though these are only _ necessary _ bounds : sufficient conditions for the applicability of the dilute model can only be determined from the dense theory . at lower optical depths , however , we expect the dilute estimates to serve as a reasonable guide .",
    "we obtain these by combining the famous equilibrium relation between optical thickness , @xmath25 , and @xmath10 , computed in gt78 ( cf .",
    "fig 7 ) , with the elasticity laws embodied in .",
    "this determines the dependence of velocity dispersion on @xmath25 .",
    "we then suppose that non - local effects may be neglected if a particle s r.m.s .",
    "speed , @xmath26 , is an order larger than the shear velocity across two particle radii , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is particle radius ( araki 1991) the ratio of these quantities is a convenient measure of ` nonlocality ' , but only for optical thicknesses less than about 1 or 2 ( see salo 1991 ) .",
    "thereupon we compute an upper limit on @xmath28 below which the dilute model is acceptable . if @xmath29 at c - ring distances , @xmath30 ranges from 31 cm ( for supulver _ et al . _",
    "s data ) to 5.3 cm ( for bridges _",
    "s data ) .",
    "at a - ring distances for @xmath31 the maximum particle radius is 33 cm ( supulver _ et al . _ ) or 6.3 cm ( bridges _ et al . _ ) . at b - ring distances and @xmath32 , the bridges _",
    "_ data imply @xmath33 cm , or , alternatively , @xmath34 cm s@xmath18 for metre - sized particles .",
    "this last estimate appears consistent with those simulations of salo ( 1991 ) in which @xmath14 was increased to 20 and 40 times @xmath35 cm / s ( cf .",
    "his fig.s 5a , 5c and 5d ) .",
    "it is interesting to note the sensitivity of the critical @xmath28 to the elasticity law adopted : relations which predict slightly less dissipative impacts allow a substantially higher velocity dispersion , and subsequently @xmath30 .",
    "our dilute ring is self - gravitating .",
    "disk self - gravity may be decomposed into three effects .",
    "firstly , inter - particle gravitational forces will lead to an additional source of ( elastic ) scattering via gravitational encounters .",
    "they will also enhance the collision frequency of physical collisions ( gravitational focusing ) . for either process to be appreciable ,",
    "the velocity dispersion must be of order the particles escape velocity , i.e. @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the gravitation constant and @xmath38 the mass density of the particle material .",
    "this can be recast as @xmath39 , for typical values of the saturnian system .",
    "as non - local effects are neglected , the left side of this scaling will be @xmath40 , and hence gravitational scattering and focusing may be omitted .",
    "secondly , the aggregate of all the particle attractions will increase the disk s vertical restoring force and further flatten the disk .",
    "subsequently the collision frequency will increase , an effect which we include .",
    "thirdly , there will arise a dynamical contribution to the disk s stability which issues from the extra term in the momentum equation . though this term will be unimportant at equilibrium , being dominated by the planet s gravitational potential",
    ", it will be significant in the linear theory .",
    "as is well known , an inviscid fluid disk collapses under the action of self - gravity for a toomre parameter @xmath41 less than 1 , its unstable modes growing on a band of intermediate wavelengths , with rotation and pressure stabilising the long and short scales respectively ( toomre 1964 , julian and toomre 1966 ) . a viscous disk however paints a slightly more complex picture . then it is better to think of self - gravity as ` extending ' the viscous instabilities we discuss into larger areas of parameter space . in these ` extensions '",
    "the instabilities grow only in a certain confined range of intermediate wavelength , unlike the non - self - gravitating case in which the longest wavelengths are the first to become viscously unstable and overstable ( schmit and tscharnuter 1995 )",
    ". we shall examine this effect in some detail particularly for the viscous instability .",
    "we should mention also that self gravity induces transient , non - axisymmetric wakes , the analysis of which we omit ( but see salo 1992a ) .",
    "consider a dilute gas of identical , smooth , inelastic spheres of mass @xmath42 with phase space distribution @xmath43 .",
    "the number of particles located in the volume @xmath44 centred at @xmath45 with velocities in the range @xmath46 centred at @xmath47 at time @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 .",
    "taking moments of @xmath50 allows us to calculate the familiar macroscopic characteristics of the gas .",
    "number density , @xmath51 , bulk velocity , @xmath52 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath24 , are defined through @xmath53 the phase space distribution satisfies a kinetic equation which is distinguished by a collision operator , @xmath54 , whose precise form reflects the collisional microphysics .",
    "we situate our gas in a _ shearing sheet_. this is a convenient representation of a differentially rotating disk in which a small patch , centred on a point moving on a circular orbit at @xmath55 , is represented as a sheet in uniform rotation , @xmath56 , and subjected to a linear shear flow , @xmath57 .",
    "the local rectilinear coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath59 point in the radial and azimuthal directions respectively , and @xmath60 ; see fig .",
    "1 . for the dynamical analysis",
    "we consider the sheet horizontally unbounded , at least compared to the vertical length scale of the disk .",
    "the model hence provides an excellent approximation for rings whose thickness is very small , such as saturn s .    in terms of the peculiar velocity ,",
    "@xmath61 , the kinetic equation for such a patch of ring is @xmath62 \\frac { { \\ensuremath{\\partial}}f}{{\\ensuremath{\\partial}}w_{i } } = \\left ( \\frac { { \\ensuremath{\\partial}}f}{{\\ensuremath{\\partial}}t } \\right)_{c},\\ ] ] where the force / unit mass is @xmath63 the appropriate centrifugal - gravitational potential of the planet is denoted by @xmath64 , and the disk s gravitational potential by @xmath65 .",
    "the tensor @xmath66 is the alternating tensor and the angular velocity is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . by multiplying by @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 and then integrating over all @xmath72 we derive the continuity equation , @xmath73 the equation of motion , @xmath74 and the pressure tensor equation , @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the second and third - order moments , @xmath78 and the collisional change in second moment is @xmath79 which is a yet to be specified function of the other field variables . for notational brevity we have set @xmath80 .",
    "0.3 cm as we are interested in scales @xmath81 there is little point in solving for a disk s detailed vertical structure .",
    "we hence vertically integrate the moment equations , a process which can be performed without much grief if it is assumed that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are effectively independent of @xmath84 .",
    "the third order moments are neglected .",
    "this move closes the system but restricts the applicability of the equations to behaviour on lengthscales much larger than the disk thickness .",
    "if the system exhibits variation on scales close to @xmath85 the vertically integrated equations will most likely predict incorrect behaviour .",
    "we now have : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , greek indices run only from @xmath58 to @xmath59 and upper case denotes vertical integration .",
    "optical thickness is subsequently defined as @xmath88 . to complete the set ,",
    "expressions for @xmath89 and @xmath90 are required .",
    "we approximate the central body as perfectly spherical , which accounts for the former potential ; the latter must be obtained from poisson s equation : @xmath91 in which we may approximate @xmath51 by @xmath92 , if it is assumed the disk is very thin .",
    "an additional equation for the mean vertical displacement of the disk , @xmath93 , can be supplied from the @xmath84 component of the equation of motion ( see ss85 ) , and the instances of @xmath94 in are identified with its rate of change , @xmath95 .",
    "but we shall not be investigating the vertical warping of the disk and shall assume symmetry about the plane @xmath96 .",
    "hence @xmath97 .",
    "it is often illuminating to work with the internal energy and viscous stress equations in place of .",
    "the former equation may be procured by taking half the trace of and defining @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the vertically averaged velocity dispersion .",
    "a viscous stress equation proceeds by subtracting from @xmath100 times the energy equation , if we define the viscous stress tensor as @xmath101 we omit these details ( see ss85 ) .",
    "we specialise to the modified bgk collision term ( bhatnagar _ et al .",
    "_ 1954 ) which shu and stewart introduce in ss85 : @xmath102 here @xmath103 designates the collision frequency and @xmath104 is the equilibrium distribution function to which the collisional process tends to push the system .",
    "this is set equal to a maxwellian .",
    "essentially the model ensures that all particles which undergo a collision at a certain time will be distributed immediately afterwards like @xmath105 .",
    "given that on the average collisions randomize velocity dispersion , this is not a bad approximation , but it does downplay the particles distribution immediately prior to the collision : if @xmath50 is very far from a maxwellian , the bgk model could overestimate the isotropizing power of collisions .    in order to account for the inelasticity of the particle collisions shu and stewart attribute to @xmath104 the same @xmath51 and @xmath52 as @xmath50 ( in order to conserve mass and momentum ) , but set its velocity dispersion @xmath106 less than @xmath107 .",
    "they then assume energy equipartition which permits them to write @xmath108 where the coefficient of restitution @xmath10 is here understood to be a quantity averaged over collisions .",
    "the approximation of energy equipartition will worsen the further @xmath50 departs from maxwellian , and may explain the discrepancy between the results of ss85 and gt78 in the collisionless limit .    to complete the model shu and stewart present an expression for the vertically averaged collision frequency .",
    "they find that , for a dilute , vertically isothermal disk with a locally maxwellian velocity distribution , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the vertical epicyclic frequency . in this case",
    "the collision frequency depends solely and linearly on @xmath111 , and not on @xmath99 .",
    "as it stands this expressions fails to capture the influence of anisotropy .",
    "but it can be improved on this count , somewhat , via inclusion of a factor @xmath112 , which comes from modifying the scale height of the disk from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "the influence of self - gravity on the vertical epicyclic oscillation may be approximated through @xmath116 if we assume @xmath65 varies slowly with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then @xmath117 in poisson s equation , and with @xmath118 this renders @xmath6 s dependence on surface number density like : @xmath119 hence @xmath6 can vary as steeply as @xmath120 in a self - gravitating disk , and at equilibrium self - gravity enhances the collision frequency by a factor @xmath121 , where @xmath41 is the toomre parameter .",
    "the equilibrium homogeneous state of keplerian shear can be computed analytically if the ss85 term is included , for which @xmath122 let @xmath123 .",
    "then , given a uniform density @xmath124 and shear rate @xmath125 , the uniform viscous stress tensor and the equilibrium value of @xmath10 proceed from .",
    "the averaged coefficent of restitution @xmath10 depends on @xmath99 uniquely and , once its equilibrium value is set , @xmath126 can be deduced from the average of eq .. the solution is @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the form of @xmath131 demonstrates a local relationship between shear and stress .",
    "therefore one may write down the effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath132 as a function of @xmath133 .",
    "note the implicit dependence on @xmath134 through @xmath135 : the equilibrium velocity dispersion depends on @xmath136 which in turn is set by @xmath134 . in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath137 ,",
    "the viscosity must keep momentum flux constant and thus goes to zero like @xmath138 ( chapman and cowling 1970 ) .",
    "but in the collisionless limit the viscosity approaches @xmath139 like @xmath140 . in this regime the trajectories of particles between collisions are long and subject to epicyclic confinement . as",
    "a consequence angular momentum transport is inefficient . because the effective viscosity vanishes in both limits there exists a turning point in the intermediate range when the gas is hot yet not too rarefied .",
    "a simple calculation shows that this turning point occurs at @xmath141 , where @xmath142 the definition of which introduces the important parameter @xmath143 for a piecewise power - law , this parameter depends on both @xmath15 and @xmath144 , but only weakly for the latter : we can roughly approximate @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "hydrodynamics would suggest that one look to the region @xmath147 to observe viscous instability and to @xmath148 for viscous overstability . because the system is dilute and the particles non - spinning there is no effective bulk viscosity .",
    "as goldreich and tremaine argue , energetic instability is assured if @xmath149 .",
    "consider a small deviation in @xmath150 _ below _ its equilibrium value .",
    "when @xmath151 this change will generate a small decrease in @xmath10 and a converse increase in collisional dissipation per collision ( on the average ) .",
    "thence cooling will slightly dominate viscous heating and thus amplify the disturbance , initiating a runaway loss of energy . a small deviation _ above _ equilibrium on the other hand causes a decrease in collisional cooling , which will precipitate a runaway heating .",
    "if @xmath152 the velocity dispersion can not adjust either way to balance the energy budget , and so the system will also be unstable .",
    "for @xmath153 the velocity dispersion will act to return the system to equilibrium if thermally disturbed , and the speed of return is proportional to the magnitude of @xmath145 .",
    "isothermality in our model hence corresponds to @xmath154 , as then any thermal perturbation will be ` instantly ' quenched .",
    "of course ` instant quenching ' is an artefact of the averaging process ; in reality a particulate disk may return to thermal equilibrium no faster than the collision time , nor could an averaged @xmath10 exhibit a steep enough dependence on @xmath24 to yield @xmath145 very large and negative .",
    "a more general perturbation including density displacements complicates the simple heuristic picture sketched above , but on long lengthscales the above argument should hold .",
    "in this section we establish the linear stability of the moment equations .",
    "we begin by presenting a number of results which hold for a second - order system derived from a kinetic equation with an unspecified collision term .",
    "consider the vertically integrated equations : @xmath155 in a shearing sheet for a general collision term , @xmath156 .",
    "now suppose eq.s  admit a homogeneous steady state characterised by the equilibrium number density @xmath157 , keplerian shear @xmath158 and equilibrium pressure tensor @xmath159 .",
    "let us perturb this solution with a small axisymmetric disturbance : @xmath160 for @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 in which @xmath164 is the wavenumber of the harmonic variation of @xmath165 ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "next we nondimensionalise : time according to the orbital timescale , @xmath166 ; space like @xmath167 ; surface density by @xmath157 ; velocity by @xmath135 and the pressure tensor by @xmath168 . on dropping the stars and linearising we acquire @xmath169 the perturbed collision terms take the form @xmath170 and self - gravity",
    "is expressed in the parameter @xmath171 defined by @xmath172 which is the inverse of the toomre @xmath41 parameter .",
    "we perform a fourier decomposition into radial modes for each perturbed quantity so that they are @xmath173 , where the growth rate is @xmath174 , and @xmath175 is the radial wavenumber .",
    "an algebraic eigenvalue problem proceeds for the growth rate : @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the eigenvector @xmath178 and @xmath179 is the @xmath180 matrix governing the linear evolution of the system . enforcing solvability returns a seventh - order dispersion relation subject to @xmath171 , the equilibrium values of @xmath181 and the derivatives of @xmath182 : @xmath183 the terms above are partitioned into those which occur independently of self - gravity ( coefficients @xmath184@xmath185 ) and those which arise if it is included ( @xmath186@xmath187 ) .",

    "they reveal that the total effect of self - gravity on the overstable modes up to @xmath200 for @xmath203 lies only in altering the wave frequency . the real part of @xmath174 ( emerging at order @xmath200 ) is unaffected .",
    "the criterion for overstability , in fact , depends on the sign of @xmath204 if @xmath205 the disk is viscously overstable .",
    "these results mirror those of a viscous fluid disk in the long - wavelength limit , as studied by schmit and tscharnuter 1995 , spahn _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , and schmidt _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 . similarly to a fluid disk we expect self - gravity to extend the range of parameters for which the viscous instability and overstability occur , when @xmath164 takes intermediate values . without self gravity",
    "the modes of longest wavelength are the most susceptible to both instabilities . but",
    "inclusion of self gravity can induce the instabilities on intermediate lengthscales , @xmath206 , as well , where both @xmath207 and @xmath208 are in the neighbourhood of the jeans length .",
    "in actual fact eq . represents the decoupling of the dynamic modes from the thermal modes at leading order when @xmath203 .",
    "this is because the @xmath209 minor of @xmath179 is @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the two - by - two ` epicyclic block ' and @xmath212 is the four - by - four ` thermal block ' : @xmath213 we have partitioned the latter matrix into a collisional component , @xmath214 ( the jacobian ) , and a part incorporating the effects of rotation and shear , @xmath215 .",
    "we presume these components scale like @xmath216 , i.e. the hydrodynamic limit will be dominated by collisional processes , and the collisionless limit by the anisotropizing effects of rotation and shear .",
    "note that , to leading order in @xmath164 , eq . and the thermal partition also hold for a dense gas model in which the terms for collisional production of @xmath181 and collisional flux of momentum are arbitrary functions of @xmath111 , @xmath181 and the rate of strain tensor .",
    "the 4 modes associated with the thermal block @xmath212 include the energy mode , familiar from hydrodynamics ( see schmidt _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , and three others which emerge from the extra degrees of freedom arising from the anisotropy . in the collisioness limit , @xmath217 , we find two modes with @xmath218 , and two with @xmath219 .",
    "the former pair , oscillating at twice the epicyclic frequency , possess , to leading order , the eigenvectors @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "these correspond to a perturbation of the velocity ellipsoid which is comprised of the oscillation of the horizontal principal axes perturbations , and their rotation with respect to the equilibrium orientation angle , @xmath222 .",
    "one of the @xmath219 modes we presume coincides with the energy mode sketched at the end of section 2.3 .",
    "the other is a mode affiliated with the relaxation of anisotropy , the features of which can not be determined until we specify @xmath182 .    in the hydrodynamic limit the thermal modes , to leading order ,",

    "these can not be ascertained until @xmath182 is known ; but if it is presumed that collisions work to destroy anisotropy then we might expect the four modes in this limit to correspond to the hydrodynamic energy mode plus three ` relaxation ' modes which express the decay of the deviatoric parts of the stress .",
    "this assumption may then be employed to determine a plausible approximation to the collision term , which , in fact , reproduces the generic krook model proposed by shu _",
    "this is clearer if we solve for @xmath150 and @xmath223 , rather than the pressure tensor , @xmath181 , in which case we write @xmath224 , where @xmath225 .",
    "first we adopt a simple model where the anisotropic parts of the stress decay independently of each other at the rate @xmath226 when in the collisional limit , but where the thermal energy mode decays at the rate @xmath227 .",
    "then the revised collision block , @xmath228 will take the simple form : @xmath229 , which suggests the formula @xmath230 where @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",

    "the importance of this detail may be approximately quantified by the magnitude of @xmath99 ( mediated by @xmath10 if preferred ) , which leads us to connect the rate of anisotropic relaxation to the velocity dispersion via the first column of @xmath228 .",
    "the collisional block will hence be no longer diagonal , and then @xmath234 will be also a function of @xmath99 .",
    "the formula which ensues for @xmath182 is the generalisation of shu _ et al . _",
    "s ` generic krook model ' ,",
    "with which it agrees to first order in anisotropy .",
    "the vertical structure of the disk may introduce anisotropy into the collisional dynamics once vertical averaging is accomplished . in this case @xmath237 and @xmath234 may depend on @xmath238 as well .",
    "we perturb about the steady state presented in eq.s  , and then linearise and non - dimensionalise analogously to the previous section but with @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",

    "we expand both @xmath241 and @xmath103 in taylor series about @xmath242 and @xmath124 respectively . in doing",
    "so we have neglected any possible variation in the collision frequency due to changes in the disk thickness ( refer to the discussion of section 2.3 ) , an approximation which simplifies the analysis .",
    "this introduces the parameters : @xmath145 ( cf .",
    "eq . ) and @xmath243",
    "if dense effects were properly included then a measure of the influence of nonlocal effects would appear in a third parameter , @xmath244 .",

    "the coefficients of the resulting characteristic polynomial in are functions of these three and are listed in appendix a.    the stability problem is more tractable than eq",

    "in fact analytic stability criteria can be derived for every instability the system exhibits in the long ( and short ) wavelength limits . that said the dispersion relation could be simplified substantially if we put into use eq . and the average of , in which case @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "but we leave these as free parameters .",
    "firstly , doing so provides a means by which the collision frequency s enhancement by the disk s self - gravity can be included .",
    "this effect should ensure @xmath6 is superlinear in @xmath111 and thus @xmath249 .",
    "secondly , leaving @xmath246 and @xmath145 open frees the system to exhibit the viscous overstability .",
    "to begin we restrict the analysis to large scales , @xmath188 , and suppose @xmath250 .",
    "given @xmath153 , it follows from that @xmath251 ; so , from , the criterion for instability is @xmath252 which , on employing , obtains @xmath253 when @xmath254 , where @xmath255 is the nondimensionalised turning point of @xmath2 , introduced in .",
    "this assures us that the instability is indeed the kinetic analogue of the viscous instability : if we substitute the expression for our particulate disk s effective kinematic viscosity ( eq . ) into the hydrodynamic criterion for viscous instability , @xmath256 we recover precisely .",
    "moreover we find that the growth rate is @xmath257 on using and again , which is exactly the growth rate of the viscous mode as computed by hydrodynamics .",
    "0.3 cm two curves of marginal viscous stability in the @xmath258 plane are plotted in fig .",
    "they diverge as @xmath133 approaches @xmath255 from above , and asymptote to @xmath247 as @xmath259 .",
    "a simple calculation demonstrates that for @xmath260 a marginal curve will asymptote to 1 from above , and for @xmath261 from below .",
    "in the hydrodynamic regime ( for a dilute ring ) we may make the identification @xmath262 .",
    "therefore the kinetic criterion of viscous instability recovers the familiar hydrodynamic criterion , @xmath263 .    when @xmath264 , both the curves turning point and @xmath265 drift to the origin , rendering more of parameter space unstable .",
    "at @xmath152 the entire quadrant is unstable , which coincides with the energy instability sketched at the end of section 2.4 . on the other hand as @xmath266 ( the isothermal limit ) we find @xmath267 , a finite value .",
    "our discussion of @xmath6 s form at the end of section 2.3 would suggest that appropriate values of @xmath246 lie between @xmath69 and @xmath268 .",
    "thus @xmath261 will ensure that such disks are viscously unstable for all collision frequencies above a critical value close to @xmath255 .",
    "a quick calculation shows this value to be @xmath269 .",
    "the data offered by experiment suggest @xmath260 , and thus indicate a _ dilute _ disk composed of hard , icy boulders falls into this category .    as the assumption of diluteness fails in saturn s rings ( as discussed earlier ) , the validity of these stability predictions is unclear .",
    "in fact , theories and simulations of ` dense ' and low - optical thickness equilibria suggest that the viscous instability should not appear ( araki and tremaine 1986 and wisdom and tremaine 1988 ) . only in the simulations of lukkari 1981 and salo 2001",
    "has the instability been observed , though the former used a scaling of the elasticity law which did not account for nonlocal effects , and the latter was for a 2d disk .",
    "so no physically realistic 3d simulation to date has exhibited the instability .",
    "this we presume is because either the parameters are not appropriate ( @xmath270 or @xmath25 too big ) or the lengthscales of the computations have not been sufficiently large to capture the unstable modes .    a final observation : if we let @xmath247 and solve for @xmath145 we produce the stability criterion : @xmath271 , which is qualitatively the same as that of stewart _ et al . _ 1984 who solve a simplified kinetic model for only the optical thickness and thermal energy .",
    "so it appears that reduction is justified here .      in the long wavelength limit",
    ", @xmath272 describes the curves of marginal viscous overstability .",
    "substituting the required coefficients obtains @xmath273 where the @xmath171 s and @xmath274 s are the polynomials : @xmath275 the modes are unstable when @xmath276 , and the denominator in negative ( corresponding to @xmath277 ) ; and when @xmath278 , and the denominator positive ( @xmath279 ) .",
    "thus the stability curve comprises two branches in the @xmath258 plane , as plotted in fig .",
    "the right branch approaches the line @xmath280 from below in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath281 , and only falls into the first quadrant of the @xmath258 plane if @xmath282 .",
    "this is a value experiments show to be too low for hard ice particles .",
    "moreover the maximum @xmath246 for which overstability in the hydrodynamic limit is possible is @xmath283 .",
    "thus a disk also needs to exhibit a strongly sublinear dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath111 for overstability to develop , which is implausible .",
    "a number of formal results follow by making the identification @xmath284 ; we then obtain the hydrodynamic criterion @xmath285 ; and if , in addition , the isothermal limit , @xmath286 , is enforced , we recover precisely the overstability criterion of schmit and tscharnuter for an isothermal fluid disk without bulk viscosity : @xmath287 .",
    "the left branch is associated with the monotonically increasing dependence of equilibrium viscosity with @xmath111 when @xmath148 .",
    "3 shows these curves to diverge when @xmath288 , and intersect the @xmath289 axis at a finite value of @xmath246 , which some algebra reveals to be @xmath290 .",
    "subsequently the minimum @xmath246 for which left - branch viscous overstability is possible is @xmath291 a highly superlinear dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath111 .",
    "it follows that for all @xmath134 and @xmath145 there exists a ` channel ' , @xmath292 , in which overstability is forbidden .",
    "the equilibria of a dilute ring lie well within this region , hence viscous overstability will not occur in a dilute ring .",
    "we complete the @xmath203 analysis by examining the four modes embodied in the ss85 thermal block @xmath293 , analogous to that appearing in eq .. we find that the cooling component of this matrix is the expected , @xmath294 , where we have defined the collisional cooling rate to be @xmath295 , and the subscript @xmath150 indicates partial differentiation with respect to squared velocity dispersion .    in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath296 ,",
    "the heating contribution to @xmath293 is subdominant and the stress components , @xmath297 , @xmath131 and @xmath298 possess ( to leading order ) a decay rate equal to @xmath134 ( representing the ` relaxation modes ' ) , while the velocity dispersion , @xmath150 , decays at the rate @xmath299 ( corresponding to the mode in which the energetic stability of the equilibrium is expressed ) .    in the converse collisionless regime , @xmath300 , we recover the complex conjugate pair we met earlier .",
    "their growth rates are @xmath301    + \\mathcal{o}(|k|),\\ ] ] and so are stable for all @xmath302 , an upper bound which is much larger than the values of @xmath145 we deem feasible .",
    "these two modes are analogous to those of the viscous overstablity , only becoming unstable when the thermal restoring forces are sufficiently strong ( i.e. @xmath145 negative and large ) . the mechanism animating them we presume works to quench perturbations of the horizontal axes of the velocity ellipsoid , but may be so effective that the resulting ` overshoot ' may instigate an oscillation of growing amplitude .",
    "the instability can therefore be thought of as an ` anisotropic overstability ' .    for general @xmath134",
    "there is a single ` relaxation mode ' with growth rate @xmath303 , composed exclusively of @xmath297 and @xmath298 perturbations in the ratio 4 to 1 .",
    "this mode deforms the velocity ellipsoid , either vertically squashing or vertically dilating it , but while maintaining @xmath99 constant .",
    "thus it is a pure rearrangement of anisotropy .",
    "factoring out this mode from the characteristic polynomial of @xmath304 leaves a cubic in @xmath174 with a single real solution corresponding to the growth rate of the energy mode .",
    "this is negative if : @xmath305>0.\\ ] ] the square bracketed term we identify as the partial derivative of the energy balance with respect to squared velocity dispersion , @xmath150 , because it is composed of the derivative of the collisional cooling function , @xmath306 , and the viscous heating , @xmath307 .",
    "thus thermal stability on large scales depends solely on the response of the energy equilibrium to small fluctuations in velocity dispersion .",
    "when we substitute @xmath299 into eq .",
    "the condition simplifies to @xmath153 , which justifies the heuristic argument offered at the end of section 2.4 .",
    "now we solve for general @xmath164 .",
    "caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of this analysis , considering the omission of the third order moments .",
    "these will certainly dominate short - scales but should also play some part on intermediate lengths .",
    "we will discuss their effects in more depth in the hydrodynamic analysis of section 4 .",
    "let us begin without self - gravity , i.e. let @xmath308 .",
    "we seek the marginal stability of non - oscillatory modes , and hence let @xmath309 .",
    "the curves of marginal stability for a mode of wavenumber @xmath164 are determined by @xmath310 which derives from eq .",
    "the criterion @xmath311 describes the marginal stability of the longest waves and coincides with the criterion of viscous instability .",
    "the criterion @xmath312 corresponds to marginal stability on the shortest wavelengths , and is associated with an energy mode . because we assume @xmath153 thermal stability will hold on long wavelengths ( see the analysis in section 3.2.3 ) but on shorter scales this need not be true .",
    "outside the long wavelength regime density perturbations can no longer be factored out and the energy balance s dependence on @xmath111 plays a part .",
    "we shall discover in the hydrodynamic analysis that this energy mode attempts to keep both pressure and viscous stress constant , and its stability is related subsequently to field s criterion ( field 1965 ) .",
    "that said the omitted terms representing the heat flux we presume enter at higher order than @xmath200 and should extinguish this instability on sufficiently short scales . on intermediate scales instability",
    "is guaranteed if @xmath313 , which refers to a hybrid mode of viscous and thermal effects .",
    "again , omission of the third order moments will probably affect its stability .    with self - gravity",
    "added the curves of marginal stability for a non - oscillatory mode are described by @xmath314 solvability for @xmath189 furnishes the criterion @xmath315 , or equivalently , @xmath316 , where @xmath41 is the toomre parameter .",
    "the critical value @xmath317 is a complicated function of @xmath134 , @xmath246 and @xmath145 , which we list in .    in fig .",
    "4 curves of marginal stability are plotted in @xmath258 space for @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "three curves are plotted .",
    "equilibria in the region above the dotted graph will develop _ viscous instability _ on all wavelengths above a critical lengthscale .",
    "this is precisely the same curve we encountered in the long wavelength analysis , as the most unstable wavelengths are the longest .",
    "the solid graph represents marginal _ viscous / gravitational instability _ ,",
    "above which equilibria become unstable .",
    "the unstable region includes that of the viscous instability , which is a special case .",
    "modes which are viscous / gravitationally unstable possess wavelengths in an interval @xmath320 bracketing the jeans length ; modes which are viscously unstable possess @xmath321 . the marginal curve of viscous / gravitational instability asymptotes to a line @xmath322 for @xmath134 large , a fact easily verified from eq .. it follows that in the hydrodynamic limit the instability criterion can be written as @xmath323 , which agrees with schmit and tscharnuter s criterion ( eq.(35 ) in schmit and tscharnuter 1995 ) for an isothermal disk .",
    "this fact suggests that the thermal properties of the ring play a negligible role on the stability criterion of the most unstable mode in the collision - dominated , hydrodynamic limit .    the dotted - dashed curve in fig .",
    "4 represents the _ quasi - thermal instability _ , which affects all modes with wavelengths _ below _ a critical intermediate value .",
    "perhaps we can then characterise it , like the viscous instability , as a special case of gravitational / viscous instability but in which @xmath324 .",
    "inclusion of a heat flux term would undoubtedly prevent @xmath207 being zero .",
    "so in reality scales sufficiently small will be stable .",
    "suppose that we take @xmath325 , @xmath326 and @xmath318 .",
    "for @xmath164 small the ss85 model predicts that viscous instability will be present in those parts of a dilute ring in which there are more than 3.5 collisions per orbit ( i.e. @xmath327 ) , a critical limit which corresponds to an optical thickness of 0.218 if we employ expression .",
    "if , however , we include @xmath6 s self - gravity factor , introduced in equation , the viscous instability can occur for lower optical thicknesses ; for example if @xmath318 instability occurs for @xmath328 .",
    "hence only the most tenuous of dilute rings will be stable .",
    "the ss85 model also suggests that on intermediate scales quasi - thermal or viscous / gravitational instability will occur in parts of the ring in which there are less than about 33 collisions per orbit ( @xmath329 ) , which corresponds to a critical @xmath25 of approximately 2 ( or less if @xmath6 s self - gravity factor is included ) .",
    "this last result is dubious , of course , because of the omission of the third order moments .",
    "the prevalence of quasi - thermal and viscous / gravitational instability on intermediate scales is a question left open until the next section .",
    "we will not undertake an analogous analysis of the viscous overstability in the intermediate range , it being algebraically intensive and not especially illuminating . in summary , the inclusion of self gravity narrows the ` channel of stability ' in the @xmath258 plane , but not sufficiently to endanger the stability of equilibria with appropriate values of @xmath246 .",
    "instability on those regions of parameter space rendered ` newly ' unstable by self - gravity disturb modes on intermediate scales only ; thus the ` old ' boundaries of stability circumscribe regions in which viscous overstability operates on arbitrarily long wavelengths .    it should be mentioned that in the @xmath330 regime the system not only evinces the unphysical extension of the quasi - thermal instability but also two pairs of unstable sound waves , which we also regard as unphysical .",
    "that said these only appear for parameter values incongruent with a dilute ring of icy particles : the first pair of modes may only be unstable when @xmath331 , and the second when @xmath332 for @xmath145 and @xmath134 sufficiently small . thus the thermal instability will be the primary problem if one sought to undertake a non - linear computation of the time - dependent equations .",
    "in this section we compare the linear analysis of our kinetic system with that of hydrodynamics .",
    "the motivation for doing so is to distinguish the effect of the viscous stress equation , which should not only capture anisotropic effects but also the non - newtonian behaviour of the stress in the range of low and intermediate @xmath134 .",
    "we produce an analysis analogous to schmidt _",
    "_ 2001 , and thus solve the mass conservation equation , the navier - stokes equation , the temperature equation and poisson s equation for a self - gravitating , viscous fluid disk in a shearing sheet .",
    "we omit however schmidt _ et al . _ s nonlocal contributions to pressure and viscosity .",
    "so as to best mimic our kinetic disk the transport coefficients have been set to those computed by the ss85 kinetic equilibrium .",
    "hence the coefficient of bulk viscosity and heat diffusivity , @xmath333 , are zero for the moment , the latter corresponding to the omission of the third order moments .",

    "thus a dilute ring of icy particles with @xmath326 , @xmath325 , and @xmath318 manifests viscous overstability for all @xmath366 , or @xmath367    this is an important qualitative difference , and which we argue results from the non - newtonian nature of the viscous stress , in particular its nonlocality in time .",
    "this effect interferes with the phase synchronisation of the stress and density oscillations , and thus the mechanism sustaining the overstable modes .",
    "it is less clear how anisotropy is at work here , but we conclude it plays a smaller effect in the linear theory .",
    "this effect we expect to be less appreciable for a dense gas , as the collisional contribution to the viscous stress , which is local in time , will be of order or greater than the free - streaming component , which is non - local in time .",
    "we derive a relation describing the marginal stability of non - oscillatory modes from if we set @xmath309 .",

    "thus the coefficient of @xmath371 determines the onset of viscous instability and dominates in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath368 introduces self - gravitation .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath370 manifests thermal effects , and is in fact equal to the derivative of @xmath349 times the net rate of cooling , @xmath373 , with respect to temperature , if _ both _ pressure and the viscous stress are kept constant . to show this we must include the variations induced by temperature and density displacements upon the shear rate , @xmath374 , which compensates for the variation in @xmath2 induced by the same perturbations .",
    "if @xmath131 is to be kept constant , given a fluctuation in @xmath111 and @xmath375 at constant @xmath376 , then @xmath377,\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath378 it follows that the criterion for quasi - thermal instability on very short scales ( when eq .",
    "is dominated by the thermal term ) is a modification of field s criterion @xmath379 ( field 1965 ) .",
    "but on intermediate scales , the potentially unstable mode will be an amalgam of effects associated with the thermal balance , self - gravitation and angular momentum transport , all constrained to maintain constant pressure and stress .",
    "the marginal curves which follow from eq .",
    "match those of ss85 ( described in fig .",
    "4 ) ; the viscous / gravitational graph nearly coincides , and the quasi - thermal graph is qualitatively the same . here",
    "the discrepancies which do exist between the two models we attribute to the breakdown of the assumptions of both on intermediate scales .",
    "their details we omit .",
    "heat diffusivity introduces the additional terms @xmath380 which contribute at sufficiently small scales .",
    "including heat conduction will also incur a @xmath200 term , @xmath381 , representing the coupling of thermal transport with rotation and viscosity .",
    "hence the criterion of intermediate scale instability will be altered significantly .",
    "this may be quantified by a critical heat diffusivity , @xmath382 below which quasi - thermal instability can emerge on a band of @xmath164 , the upper limit depending sensitively on @xmath333 .",
    "an expression for this quantity in the non - self - gravitating case is presented in eq .. we find this critical value to be very small indeed ; for instance , when @xmath326 , @xmath247 and @xmath383 then @xmath384 . the dilute kinetic theory asserts that @xmath385 ( cowling and chapman 1970 ) , so for only dilute rings of large optical thicknesses ( @xmath386 ) should feature the quasi - thermal instability .",
    "when the destabilising effect of self - gravity is added , however , @xmath382 can approach feasible values .",
    "instability in this case we name viscous / gravitational , though in fact the mode in question is fueled by viscous , gravitational and thermal processes . in order to establish how this instability impacts on the various scales we plot curves of marginal stability in the @xmath258 plane for given @xmath145 , @xmath333 and @xmath164 , as described by eq .",
    "when @xmath387 we find that the marginal curves fall into three categories corresponding to long , intermediate and short scales . for scales",
    "@xmath388 we obtain curves resembling those of viscous instability ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . but for scales @xmath389 there appear two branches , the right one familiar from fig .",
    "4 , the left arising from non - zero @xmath333 . instability emerges on equilibria situated between the two . we conclude that heat diffusion confines instability on intermediate scales to a smaller area of parameter space than predicted otherwise ; in particular , equilibria with low @xmath134 are stabilised . for short waves , @xmath390 , the marginal curves mimic in shape those of long wavelength , but as @xmath164 gets large @xmath391",
    ". therefore if small scales are to be rendered unstable the system needs to exhibit an inappropriately large value of @xmath246 .",
    "as expected , heat diffusivity stabilizes short scales .",
    "expressions for @xmath392 and @xmath393 may be obtained by examining the real roots shared by the numerator and denominator of . for @xmath394 , they are approximately equal to @xmath395 , which lie on either side of half the jeans length .",
    "the fluid model then predicts that a dilute ring , with self gravity ( @xmath325 ) and @xmath394 , is stable on scales @xmath396 , or about 5 times the disk semi - thickness .",
    "it is likely a kinetic theory , accounting for heat conductivity adequately , would predict similar results , though this can not be checked until such a model is devised .",
    "however , hydrodynamics shows clearly that if we wish to study behaviour on intermediate and short scales , it is necessary to include in some way the third - order moments .",
    "this section outlines the linear stability of the gt78 model , so as to compare the modified krook collision term with that of a formal boltzmann - type account .",
    "goldreich and tremaine take the distribution function , @xmath50 , to be a three - dimensional gaussian in velocity space with its axes corresponding to the principal axes of the pressure tensor , @xmath76 . assuming symmetry about the plane @xmath96 , the principal axis system is denoted by the unit vectors @xmath397 , @xmath398 and @xmath399 , so that @xmath400 , where @xmath222 denotes the orientation angle .",
    "the principal values of @xmath76 are accordingly defined by @xmath401 , where @xmath402 , and the summation convention is not applied .",
    "the velocity distribution is then @xmath403 this form results in a much simplified collision term ; see eq ( 33 ) in gt78 .",
    "however to facilitate better the comparison with ss85 , we assume the value of @xmath10 , which appears in the collisional kinematics , is a quantity averaged over collisions , and not a constant .",
    "also we note that the implicit collision frequency in the resulting @xmath182 is @xmath404 and thus is dependent on the velocity dispersions , being ` weighted ' differently for each direction .",
    "it does not capture self gravity or filling factor effects in its present form these requiring a superlinear dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "for the equilibrium analysis we solve the four components of the pressure tensor equation in the principal axis frame , cf .",
    "eqs ( 37 ) in gt78 . given @xmath25 ,",
    "these determine @xmath10 , @xmath222 , and the axis ratios of the velocity ellipsoid , @xmath405 and @xmath406 .",
    "the results of our numerical root finding reproduce those of gt78 and can be observed in fig . 7 , in which we plot the @xmath407 law only . the ss85 relationship is plotted for comparison .",
    "eq . has been used to relate @xmath25 and @xmath6 . as mentioned earlier the discrepancy at low @xmath25",
    "is marked . for more discussion of this see ss85 and shu _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 .      in order to model the action of self gravity on the collision frequency",
    "we re - parametrise the disk equilibrium and replace optical thickness by @xmath134 , as expressed in . for the purposes of the linear stability analysis",
    "we then treat @xmath6 as a superlinear function of @xmath111 .",
    "this we admit is somewhat crude but should approximate to an acceptable degree self - gravity s enhancement of the collision frequency , and certainly sharpen the comparison with the ss85 model .",
    "we now perturb about the steady state calculated in the previous section .",
    "we then linearise and non - dimensionalise , though on account of the complicated form of the collision term this process is rather involved :    1 .",
    "first , we must calculate , in the principal axis frame , the three collision term perturbations , @xmath408 , in terms of perturbations of @xmath25 , @xmath222 , and the principal velocity dispersions , @xmath409 .",
    "2 .   then the @xmath410 and @xmath222 perturbations are converted to those of the @xmath411 components using coordinate transformation rules .",
    "lastly @xmath412 is written in terms of @xmath408 using the transformation rules .    in this scheme @xmath10",
    "is assumed a function of @xmath150 , where @xmath413 , and is taylor expanded about the steady state . after it is assumed that the perturbations are wavelike and axisymmetric",
    ", a seventh - order dispersion relation emerges of the same structure as and dependent on the three parameters , @xmath133 , @xmath246 and @xmath145 , alongside @xmath164 .    given @xmath145 , the marginal curves of the viscous instability and overstability are numerically determined in the @xmath258 plane .",
    "they are plotted in figs 8 and 9 .    the curves for the viscous instability share the same qualitative features as those of the ss85 model .",
    "though the former deviate somewhat in shape , their singularities approximately coincide , they asymptote to the line @xmath247 , and the critical value of @xmath145 ( which determines whether a curve approaches this line from above or below ) is roughly @xmath414 .",
    "this suggests that not only is the viscous mode resistant to the effects of non - locality in time ( as proven in the previous section ) but also to the details of the collision term , in particular to anisotropy , for which the goldreich and tremaine model accounts somewhat better .",
    "both branches of the curves of overstability agree in their general features with those of ss85 . in the large @xmath134 limit ,",
    "the right branches asymptote to @xmath415 ; in the isothermal limit this constant is @xmath283 , according with the ss85 and fluid models .",
    "however the critical @xmath145 , below which marginal curves can cross into the first quadrant , is closer to @xmath416 than @xmath417 .",
    "also the left branches intersect the @xmath289 axis at slightly lower values : stability is assured in the region left of the singularity if @xmath418 , as opposed to @xmath291 .",
    "we conclude that the linear stability of the viscous overstability is a little more sensitive to the details of the collision term , and hence anisotropy though not nearly as much as to non - locality in time .",
    "as previously mentioned , the mechanism of overstability relies on the synchronisation of two oscillations , that of the acoustic - inertial wave , and that of a forcing which issues from the accompanying variation in angular momentum flux .",
    "the instability is vulnerable to disruption in the phase and in the magnitude of this forcing . a stress free to oscillate independently certainly impacts on the former .",
    "anisotropy may impact on the latter .",
    "lastly we resolve the potential ` anisotropic overstable ' modes for low @xmath134 and find them unstable for @xmath419 , far larger than predicted by the ss85 model ( though still unfeasible ) .",
    "this emphasises again the fact that the two models differ most in their treatment of anisotropy .",
    "we conclude that the less accurate ss85 model , only linear in @xmath223 , fails to fully model the deformations of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the linear stability of a patch of a dilute planetary ring in a shearing sheet employing a second - order kinetic theory .",
    "we have defined ` diluteness ' as the insignificance of non - local effects , whose importance we can roughly quantify by @xmath420 for lower optical depths . but throughout saturn s rings the velocity dispersion is low enough and particle size large enough , for this quantity to be non - negligible , thus we recognise that the applicability of a dilute model is restricted .",
    "nevertheless this work reveals the interesting effects anisotropy and non - newtonian stress have on the viscous instability and overstability .",
    "it also provides a preliminary framework in which a linear analysis of a dense gas may be undertaken .",
    "we adopted a system of vertically integrated moment equations derived from shu and stewart s inelastic generalisation of the bgk equation in their 1985 paper .",
    "the ensuing system manifests both the viscous instability and overstability in the long - wavelength limit , and their extensions induced by self - gravity on intervals of intermediate wavelength .",
    "it predicts viscous or viscous / gravitational instability in dilute rings where particles collide about 3.5 times or more per orbit ( optical thicknesses greater than 0.2 , or less depending on the importance of self - gravity on the collision frequency ) .",
    "viscous overstability does not feature in dilute regions .",
    "these results were compared with a hydrodynamic model incorporating the kinetic theory s effective viscosity ( evaluated at equilibrium ) and cooling function .",
    "we find that the criterion for viscous instability is precisely the same as that for the kinetic model , but the two criteria diverge in the intermediate range of collision frequency for the viscous overstability . according to the kinetics , overstability is suppressed in this regime , a result in contradiction with the fluid model which predicts the instability to be widespread .",
    "we conclude that hydrodynamics presents a misleading impression of the viscous overstability s prevalence on small and intermediate ranges of @xmath421 , for a dilute ring .",
    "this arises from the increasingly non - newtonian nature of the stress in this regime , an effect the kinetic account captures but which the hydrodynamical can not .",
    "we stress that this incongruence will be most marked for a dilute ring ; as the collisional stress tensor is local in time , we assume the denser the ring the better the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "we also undertook a linear stability analysis of the goldreich and tremaine 1978 kinetic model , employing a boltzmann - type collision term with a triaxial gaussian , which should factor in anisotropic effects more thoroughly .",
    "the criteria for viscous instability and overstability mirror qualitatively that of the ss85 model , and thus suggest that the linear dynamics of a disk are insensitive to the the precise details of the collision term . in particular , the criterion of viscous instability matches closely that of the ss85 model .",
    "the mechanism of this instability would thus seem relatively robust , not only resistant to the effects of non - locality in time but also of anisotropy .",
    "the discrepancy between the marginal curves of viscous overstability computed by the ss85 and gt78 models is a little more pronounced .",
    "we conclude the viscous overstability is relatively fragile for small and intermediate @xmath421 very susceptible to non - locality in time and slightly altered by anisotropy    on intermediate and short scales the ss85 model also predicted the emergence of a quasi - thermal instability which the hydrodynamical analysis revealed to be associated with a mode orienting the thermal and density perturbations in such a way to keep the equation of motion undisturbed .",
    "this mechanism thus mimicks that operating in field s thermal instability ( field 1965 ) .",
    "we find that the instability should occur on optical thicknesses less than 2 .",
    "however hydrodynamics shows that this instability is severely sensitive to heat conduction ; @xmath333 need not be large to extinguish it entirely . thus the omission of third - order moments in the kinetic model bestows on it a prominence that it does not deserve . when self - gravity is included intermediate scale instability can occur for much larger @xmath333 which in this case we refer to as a ` viscous / gravitational instability ' .",
    "self - gravity , in addition to its important dynamic role on intermediate scales , will enhance the collision frequency , and render the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath111 as steeply as @xmath120 .",
    "in general this will make the system more susceptible to both the viscous instability and overstability on long lengthscales .",
    "two possibly fruitful avenues which proceed from this work are : linear stability calculations of dense and/or spinning particle disks , and nonlinear studies of the evolution of the viscous instability and overstability using the second - order moment equations .    in principle the techniques employed here can be set upon kinetic models of dense and spinning rings .",
    "detailed formulations have been developed in shukhman 1984 , araki and tremaine 1986 , araki 1988 and araki 1991 , but , unmodified , their algebraical truculence surely prohibits all but equilibrium calculations .",
    "the success of the ss85 model encourages us that a simplification of the dense disk collision terms could provide a model that captures the essential physics , and also expedites linear and nonlinear analysis .",
    "the results obtained with such a model would be directly pertinent to n - body simulations and saturn s b - ring .",
    "it could also ascertain the validity of the fluid description in the dense regime .",
    "it would be instructive also to determine the impact of the nonlinear evolution of the second - order moments on the development of the instabilities discussed , as compared to the newtonian fluid model , which so far has only been explored in the isothermal case ( schmit and tscharnuter 1999 ) .",
    "they may elicit interesting nonlinear behaviour from the viscous overstability .",
    "but an understanding of the small - scale instabilities , even if unphysical , is essential for the sucessful numerical implementation of these equations .",
