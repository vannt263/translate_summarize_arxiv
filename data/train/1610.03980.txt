    "observation of the charmonium like @xmath3 resonance by the belle collaboration @xcite opens new directions in particle physics . at present",
    ", more than 23 new exotic particles are discovered experimentally ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the usual thing about these discoveries is that , these states denoted as xyz family , can not be described by the usual quark ",
    "antiquark picture , and these are indications that they have more complicated structures .",
    "experiments are usually focused on the measurement of their masses , identifications of their spins , parities , as well as decay widths .",
    "these experimental observations have stimulated theoretical studies in this direction . in theoretical analysis for studying the properties of exotic states , usually two pictures ,",
    "tetra  quark or molecular picture ( bound states of two mesons ) , are used ( for a review see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recently the do collaboration has reported the observation of the @xmath0 state @xcite , whose analysis assigned the quantum numbers @xmath4 , while did not exclude the possibility @xmath5 . later however , lhcb @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations did not confirm the existence of this state .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath0 resonance by do collaboration still needs solid experimental conformation .",
    "the analysis of the mass , decay width @xmath6 has already been performed with the quantum number @xmath4 in many works ( see @xcite@xcite ) .    in the present work",
    ", we assume that @xmath0 state and its charm partner ( hereafter we will denote these states as @xmath7 ) has quantum numbers @xmath1 , and calculate the magnetic moment of these exotic states . obviously , the @xmath7 state with the quantum numbers @xmath4 has zero magnetic moment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we consider @xmath0 state , and its partner with @xmath8quark as a tetra ",
    "quark state with the quantum numbers @xmath1 , and calculate the magnetic moment of these states in the framework of the light cone qcd sum rules method .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the sum rules obtained for this exotic state .",
    "in calculating the magnetic moment of the @xmath7 meson in the framework of the light cone qcd sum rules , we start by considering the following correlation function , [ edmn01 ] _ ( p , q ) = - d^4y e^ipx 0 \\{j_^x_q(x ) j_(y ) j_^x_q ( 0 ) } 0 . here , the current @xmath9 with the quantum number @xmath1 describes the corresponding @xmath7 meson , and has the form , [ edmn02 ] j_^x_q ^abc^ade \\ { ( s^bt ( x ) c _ 5 u^c ) ( |q^d ( x ) c _ |d^et ) ( s^bt ( x ) c _ u^c ) ( |q^d ( x ) c _ 5 |d^et ) } , where @xmath10 are the color indices , @xmath11 is the charge conjugation operator .",

    "from technical point of view , it is quite useful to rewrite the correlation function by introducing the background electromagnetic plane wave field f _ = i ( _ ^q_- _ ^q_),where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the polarization and four  momentum of the background electromagnetic field . the correlator can then be written as , [ edmn03 ] _",

    "the correlation function ( [ edmn01 ] ) can be obtained by expanding eq .",
    "( [ edmn03 ] ) in powers of the background field , and keeping only terms linear in @xmath15 , which corresponds to the single photon emission ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details about the background field ) .",
