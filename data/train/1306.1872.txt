    "the parton distributions of nucleons are important components of our understanding of high energy physics .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of parton densities was predicted based on a rigorous application of the renormalization group equations in qcd , guaranteeing the factorization of parton - densities in @xcite .",
    "currently the available parton distributions were extracted from the experimental data with the linear qcd evolution equation - the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite , which describes all results of @xcite using an illuminating partonic picture .",
    "the solutions of the dglap equations depend on the initial parton distributions at low starting scale @xmath0 .",
    "there are two different choices for the input distributions : ( 1 ) in global analysis , the starting point is fixed at an arbitrary scale @xmath4gev@xmath5 and the corresponding input parton distributions are parameterized by comparing with the measured data at @xmath6 .",
    "these input distributions are irrelevant to any physics models , one may even input negative gluon distributions ; ( 2 ) in dynamical models , the parton distributions at @xmath7gev@xmath5 are generated by qcd radiative corrections generated from imaginary intrinsic parton distributions at an optimally determined @xmath8gev@xmath5 according to the nucleon model .",
    "for example , it is well known that the nucleons consist of three constituents at very low @xmath1 .",
    "a natural attempt , firstly proposed in 1977 , is to assume that the nucleons consist of valence quarks at low starting point @xmath0 ( but still in the perturbative region @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , and the gluons and sea quarks are radioactively produced at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these input distributions allow one to construct a complete qcd picture of the proton @xcite .",
    "however , such natural inputs fail due to overly steep behavior of the predicted parton distributions at the small bjorken variable @xmath12 . instead of the natural inputs , reya , glck and vogt ( grv ) @xcite added the valance like sea quarks and gluon distributions to the input parton distributions at a little larger @xmath1 scale .",
    "the predictions of the grv model are compatible with the data at @xmath13gev@xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "all the above approaches determine the parton distributions via the dglap equation .",
    "comparing with the natural input distributions , the valence - like distributions of the gluon and sea quarks in the grv - model can slow down the evolution of the dglap equation at low @xmath1 and reach agreement with experimental results , since the evolution region of the valence like distributions is sizeably larger . on the other hand , we know that the contributions from the parton recombination corrections become important at @xmath15gev@xmath5 , which are neglected in the dglap equation . the correlation among initial partons",
    "can not be neglected towards small @xmath12 and low @xmath1 .",
    "the negative corrections of the parton recombination also slow down the partons evolution .",
    "these nonlinear effects can be calculated in the perturbative qcd .",
    "the nonlinear corrections of the gluon recombination to the dglap equation were firstly derived by gribov , levin and ryskin @xcite and by mueller and qiu @xcite in the double leading logarithmic ( dll ) approximation ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the similar research for the nonlinear corrections to the dglap equation was discussed by many authors @xcite . in particularly , this evolution equation was re - derived to include parton recombination at all @xmath12 by zhu , ruan and shen @xcite in the leading logarithmic ( ll(q@xmath5 ) ) approximation .",
    "we refer to this version of the nonlinear corrections as the zrs corrections to the dglap equation .",
    "although the relation between the derivation of the nonlinear part and the renormalization group theory is unclear , in this approach @xcite all stages of the calculation refer to parton concepts and offer a very illuminating physical interpretation of the parton recombination using the time ordered perturbative theory ( topt ) .",
    "the success of the grv model inspires us to use natural inputs to replace the valence like inputs in the grv model due to the nonlinear corrections of the parton recombination .",
    "our main results are : ( i ) we find that the zrs corrections suppress the fast increase of the sea quark- and gluon - densities using the natural input and has similar results as the grv(98lo ) @xcite at @xmath14 and @xmath16gev@xmath5 ; ( ii ) we predict that the parton distributions at @xmath17gev@xmath5 are positively defined , particularly , the sea quark distributions appear a plateau at small @xmath12 and low @xmath1 , indicating pomeron - like behavior @xcite ; ( iii ) our input quark distributions are compatible with the valence quark distributions predicted by effective chiral quark model @xcite ; ( iv ) this evidence of the parton recombination existing in the standard qcd evolution provides a possible dynamical way to explore the nuclear shadowing effects .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we present the zrs corrections to the dglap equation in sec .",
    "2 . using the nonlinear qcd evolution equation and the natural input distributions",
    ", we calculate the evolution of the parton distributions in the proton , and the corresponding parameters are discussed in sec .",
    "our resulting parton distributions comparing with the experimental data and some databases are presented in sec .",
    "section 5 is the discussion and summary , where the applicability of the dglap equation with the zrs corrections at the low @xmath1 is discussed .",
    "the dglap equation predicts a strong rise in the parton densities when the bjorken variable @xmath12 decrease toward small values due to the elementary process is one - parton splitting to two - partons .",
    "this behavior violates unitarity .",
    "one can expect that at very large number densities of partons , for example in the small @xmath12 region , the wave functions of partons can overlap . in this case",
    "the contributions of two - partons - to - two - partons subprocesses ( i.e. , parton recombination ) should be considered in the qcd evolution equations .",
    "various models are proposed to modify the twist-2 dglap evolution kernels ( i.e. , the parton splitting functions ) .",
    "the derivation of such equations needs to sum the contributions from real and interference feynman diagrams and corresponding virtual diagrams .",
    "gribov , levin and ryskin in @xcite use the agk cutting rule @xcite to count the contributions of interference diagrams . later mueller and qiu @xcite calculate the ( real ) gluon recombination functions at the double leading logarithmic approximation ( dlla ) in a covariant perturbation framework .        however , the following motivations led zhu and his cooperators to re - derive the above qcd evolution equation with the parton recombination corrections : ( 1 ) the application of the agk cutting rule in the glr - mq corrections breaks the evolution kernels ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( 2 ) the glr - mq corrections to the dglap equation violate the momentum conservation@xcite ; ( 3 ) the dll approximation is valid only at small @xmath12 and the glr - mq corrections can not smoothly connect with the dglap equation @xcite .    to avoid these disadvantages , the relations among the relevant high twist - amplitudes are derived by using the topt approach at the ll(@xmath1 ) approximation in a same framework as the derivation of the dglap equation in @xcite , where the topt cutting rules are proposed to connect with various cut diagrams instead of the agk cutting rules .",
    "thus , one can obtain the complete contributions only using the calculations of the real cut diagrams . as a consequence , a set of new evolution equations with parton recombination in a general framework was established . in next step ,",

    ". however , the infrared ( ir ) divergence due to the gauge singularities in some twist-4 amplitudes prevents us from using the equivalent particle approximation , since these gauge terms are coupled with the backward components of two parton legs which connect with the probe . in the derivation of the glr - mq corrections , the gauge singularities become finite using a contour integral . in this method ,",
    "the backward components of two legs still exist , i.e. , the propagators of the legs are off - mass - shell .",
    "this implies that the equivalent particle approximation is invalid . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge singularities in the twist-4 coefficient functions are safely removed from the zrs corrections using the topt method .",
    "thus , the recombination kernels can be simply separated from the coefficient functions at the equivalent particle approximation .",
    "a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the equation is a result summing all possible cut diagrams up to twist-4 in a quantum field theory framework ( i.e. , the topt ) instead of using the agk cutting rules .",
    "the two - parton - to - two - parton amplitude leads to the positive ( antishadowing ) effect , while the contributions of interference amplitudes between the one - parton - to - two - partons and the three - partons - to - two - partons processes yield a negative ( shadowing ) effect .",
    "the coexistence of shadowing and antishadowing in the qcd evolution of the parton densities is a general requisition of the local momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the shadowing and antishadowing terms are defined on different kinematic domains @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] , respectively .",

    "thus , the antishadowing effect in the glr - mq corrections is completely canceled by the effect and the resulting evolution equation violates the momentum conservation .",
    "\\(3 ) since eqs . ( 1)-(3 ) are derived at the ll@xmath78 approximation and they contain the terms beyond the dll approximation , the dglap equation with the zrs corrections is valid in the full-@xmath12 range if we neglect the balitsky- fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) corrections @xcite at the very small-@xmath12 region .",
    "thus , the zrs corrections can smoothly connect with the dglap equation .",
    "\\(4 ) the sea quark evolutions in the zrs corrections ( 1-b ) and glr - mq corrections ( a-2 ) ( see appendix a ) take different forms .",
    "the reason is that the transition of gluon - quarks is suppressed in the dlla manner .",
    "the dlla diagram contains only the gluon ladders and any transitions of gluon - quark break the gluon ladder structure .",
    "therefore , a special box diagram is used to include the corrections of gluon recombination to the quark distributions in the glr - mq corrections . however , this extra diagram is unnecessary in the derivation of the zrs corrections , since we can produce the evolution equations for gluon and sea quarks in the same framework at the ll@xmath78 approximation .",
    "\\(5 ) the combining distribution of two partons , for say two gluons , is assumed to be @xmath79 either in the zrs corrections or in the glr - mq corrections .",
    "this is a simplest model .",
    "one of us ( w.z . ) has discussed the recombination of gluons with different values of @xmath12 in the nonlinear evolution equation and finds that this modification unreasonably enhances the shadowing effect in the glr - mq corrections , while it does not change the predictions of the zrs corrections , since the momentum conservation plays an important role in this result @xcite .    comparing with the glr - mq corrections , the zrs corrections reasonably describe the corrections of the parton recombination to the dglap equation at the twist-4 level .",

    "the parton distributions will asymptotically approach a finite value by the action of the net shadowing in the leading order level . on the other hand ,",
