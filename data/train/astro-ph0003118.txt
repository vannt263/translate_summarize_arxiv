    "a master image was made by aligning and combining the highest quality frames ( best seeing and darkest sky ) .",

    "a synthetic reference system was defined using the mean instrumental magnitudes of the calibration stars .",

    "the rms residuals were computed for each star . only the stars with the smallest residuals ( @xmath26 ) were conserved as calibration stars .",

    "the above enumerated steps were performed independently for each observing run .",
    "we proceeded in this way because the stars available as calibrators are not the same for each run , due to pointing differences . on the other hand ,",
    "some stars remain perfectly stable during a run , but show luminosity variations from one year to another , being then inadequate as calibrators between different runs .    after this first stage of calibration was complete , a list of robust estimates of instrumental stellar magnitudes and their dispersions was constructed for each run . after cross identification between the three lists , the most stable stars were selected to serve as calibrators between the different runs .    during the 1997 run",

    "we combined the @xmath5 frames acquired during 1997 to make a master @xmath5 image , on which we performed a profile fitting photometry .",
    "we used this photometry together with that performed on the @xmath0 master frame to generate a colour - magnitude diagram , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ colomag ] .    in this figure ,",
    "the presence of an ob association covering the whole frame ( @xmath462 of diameter ) is evident .",
    "ostrov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found evidence of a stellar association surrounding the massive binary system .",
    "the relatively small angular distance between the two stellar groups ( @xmath463 ) suggests that they are probably related .",
    "we have obtained spectroscopic data for five stars in the neighbourhood of   sk-67@xmath8105 . for these stars ,",
    "we have estimated the reddening by comparison between the intrinsic @xmath464 colours given by schmidt - kaler ( @xcite ) and fitzgerald ( @xcite ) and the observed colours .",
    "we derived @xmath465 , while for hv2543 itself we obtained @xmath466 .",
    "a detailed study of these ob associations will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we note that the radius derived for the o8 component is substantially larger than the one obtained by niemela & bassino ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the spectroscopic data suggest that the luminosity of the o9 star is larger than that of the o8 star , which caused niemela & bassino to refer to the o9 component as `` primary '' , even though it is the one presenting the largest radial velocity amplitude , and consequently the less massive component of the binary system . hence , we explored alternative solutions to the light curve that could yield a smaller radius for the o8 component .",
    "the values @xmath467 , @xmath468 , @xmath469 and @xmath470 , in solar units , provide a good fit to the light curve , although they require a value of @xmath438 near 0.9 , which is not compatible with the radial velocity data .",
    "hence we have discarded this solution , which on the other hand , implies a rather low value of the distance modulus , namely 18.18 , assuming @xmath471 ( see below ) and adopting the temperature scale of chlebowski & garmany ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value would result even smaller if a lower temperature scale is adopted .",
    "on the other hand , the temperature difference between the two components of hv2543 resulting from the light curve analysis is larger than that suggested by the corresponding spectral types .",
    "this fact might be due to the difference between the spectral features of the unperturbed back sides and the heated inner sides of the stars .",
    "also should we have in mind that the mass transfer history of the system might account for significant departures of the he abundances relative to those regarded as normal for lmc members , and this effect could influence some spectral lines of the secondary component .    to solve these puzzles , high dispersion spectroscopy would be desirable",
    ".    the semimajor axis and star dimensions of this system are alike those determined by pritchard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for , but the masses are somewhat smaller .",
    "we presume that these systems have experienced case a mass transfer , being now in the slow stage of mass exchange . in these cases ,",
    "the mass gainer should be indistinguishable of a normal star , excepting that it would stand on an isochrone corresponding to a shorter age ( see vanbeveren et al .",
    "@xcite ) . from the stellar models of schaerer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( for single stars ) we found that a @xmath472 star takes @xmath473 myr until its radius grows to @xmath474 , but such star would have an effective temperature of only 30000k . the radius and effective temperature derived for the o8 star are consistent whit those of a single star of some 3.7 myrs and @xmath475 , completely out of the range of masses compatible with the radial velocity data .",
    "we note that a similar problem arises from the analysis of ( lorenz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that there are a series of phenomena that we do not fully understand , and consequently , our analysis can not be considered definitive .",
    "the errors given for the derived parameters must be considered with caution .",
    "true errors are not easy to estimate analytically , since they depend on the importance of phenomena that are not properly accounted for , such as wind shocks , uncertainty of the adopted temperature scale , radiation pressure effects , etc .",
    "in fact , the sizes and positions of the spots used to model empirically the oconnell effect are rather arbitrary , and an equally satisfactory solution could be found with other parameters , but these details do not affect meaningly the derived star dimensions .    from our photometry",
    "we determine @xmath476 for hv2543 .",
    "this value is somewhat redder than @xmath477 , obtained by isserstedt ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , given that isserstedt does not detect the variability of hv2543 , we think that both measures are still in reasonable agreement .",
    "if we assume a @xmath464 of -0.31 ( schmidt - kaler @xcite ) , @xmath478 ( koornneef @xcite ) then it results an @xmath479 for hv2543 .",
    "this value does not depend on which temperature scale we adopt , since for the range of temperatures of the o - type stars the @xmath480 colours are degenerated .",
    "estimating the bolometric corrections according to massey & hunter ( @xcite ) , we derive a distance modulus of @xmath481 to @xmath482 , depending on the adopted temperature scale .",
    "the error accounts for the uncertainties in the estimates of @xmath483 and the bolometric corrections .",
    "this distance modulus must be considered with caution , since this system has experienced strong mass transfer and exhibits the above mentioned anomalies .",
    "we have presented a ccd @xmath0 light curve of the eclipsing binary hv2543 ( sk-67@xmath8117 ) in the lmc .",
    "the light curve appearance is almost symmetric , with a slight ( @xmath484 magnitudes ) oconnell effect . from @xmath461 photometry of the surrounding field",
    ", we found that hv2543 probably belongs to an ob association not previously identified .",
    "we have analysed this light curve and the published radial velocity data using the wilson - devinney code , finding that hv2543 is a semidetached system with the less massive and less luminous member filling its roche lobe .",
    "the primary minimum occurs when the o8 component is behind the o9 . from our analysis",
    ", we derived fundamental parameters for this system , obtaining @xmath485 , @xmath486 , @xmath487 and @xmath488 in solar units . some discrepancies between the present results and those derived from the previous spectroscopic analysis ( niemela & bassino @xcite ) , should be thoroughly addressed in future works .",
