    "lattice chiral effective field theory  ( eft ) is an _ ab initio _",
    "framework  @xcite which has recently been applied to studies of the structure of light and medium - mass nuclei  @xcite , as well as to the physics of dilute neutron matter  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the structure of @xmath0c and @xmath2o has recently been elucidated using lattice chiral eft  @xcite .",
    "the role of the hoyle state in @xmath0c has also been investigated , along with its anthropic implications for the viability of carbon - based life as we know it  @xcite . these successes notwithstanding , lattice chiral eft has so far mainly been applied to `` alpha nuclei '' , _",
    "i.e. _ to nuclei with @xmath3 a multiple of 4 and with an equal number of protons and neutrons .",
    "this limitation is due to the appearance of sign oscillations ( the so - called sign problem ) in the projection monte carlo  ( pmc ) calculation at large euclidean time .",
    "the sign problem also necessitates the use of relatively large lattice spacings of @xmath4  fm , in order to moderate the repulsive short - range contributions in the leading - order  ( lo ) lattice chiral eft hamiltonian .",
    "even then , the low - lying spectra of most alpha nuclei can only be extracted after considerable extrapolation in euclidean time .",
    "for instance , this has so far precluded studies of neutron - rich halo nuclei where sign oscillations are more severe .    in spite of the sign problem prevalent in lattice chiral eft ,",
    "useful results have been made possible by the observation that nuclei can be approximately described by a hamiltonian which respects the wigner su(4 ) symmetry where spin and isospin degrees of freedom are interchangeable  @xcite . since euclidean time projection with an su(4 )",
    "symmetric hamiltonian is possible for most nuclei without a sign problem , one can obtain a trial wave function which is much closer to the ground state of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the shorter euclidean projection time possible with the full hamiltonian then becomes sufficient , and moreover the coupling constant of the su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonian can be varied in order to generate a large set of independent trial states .",
    "such self - consistent extrapolation in euclidean time , also referred to as `` triangulation '' , allows for a much more precise determination of the properties of the nuclei under investigation than would otherwise be possible .",
    "the usefulness of the wigner su(4 ) symmetry was also noted earlier in a different but related context .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the nuclear interactions are su(4 ) symmetric in the limit of infinite colors , @xmath5 .",
    "further insight was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that in the limit of large @xmath6-wave scattering lengths , the two - nucleon interactions exhibit wigner su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "we shall now take the idea of the su(4 ) symmetric auxiliary hamiltonian one step further by considering a weighted sum of the full and su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "in particular , the weight of each component in the hamiltonian is controlled by a parameter @xmath7 such that for @xmath8 we have the full hamiltonian only , and for @xmath9 we have the su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonian only . for values @xmath10",
    ", we have a linear combination of the two hamiltonians .",
    "the properties of the physical system are then found by extrapolation to @xmath11 , combined with an extrapolation in euclidean time . as will be shown here ,",
    "this allows us to circumvent the sign problem to a large extent , and opens up the possibility to study neutron - rich nuclei and systems where @xmath12 .",
    "it also allows us to access much larger euclidean projection times with the physical hamiltonian , thereby greatly increasing the level of confidence in the euclidean time extrapolation",
    ". we shall demonstrate this `` symmetry - sign extrapolation '' ( sse ) method by refining our earlier results for the ground state of @xmath0c , and by computing the ground state energies of @xmath1he and @xmath1be .",
    "we begin in section  [ sect : symm ] by introducing the sse method and discussing the origin of the sign problem in lattice chiral eft , and in section  [ sect:12c ] we present our method of analyzing the pmc data , along with our updated results for @xmath0c . in section  [ sect:6he ] , we apply symmetry - sign extrapolation to the @xmath1he nucleus and its mirror isobar @xmath1be .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] we discuss the prospects for extending our method to more neutron - rich nuclei and to nuclei where @xmath12 .",
    "in order to introduce the sse method , we first briefly recall the ingredients of lattice chiral eft at lo in the eft expansion in @xmath13 . the lo contribution is treated non - perturbatively , while nlo and higher order terms are included as a perturbative correction .",
    "we use the same notation as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and further details of the lattice action can be found there . at lo ,",
    "the lattice chiral eft partition function is given by @xmath14 \\",
    ": \\mathrm{tr } \\bigg\\ { m^{}_\\mathrm{lo}(\\pi^\\prime_i , n_t^{}-1 ) \\cdots \\ , m^{}_\\mathrm{lo}(\\pi^\\prime_i,0 ) \\bigg\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the pion field and @xmath16 is the free pion lattice action . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are using an improved lo operator where the contact interactions depend on the momentum transfer through a smooth smearing function @xmath17 .",
    "the normal - ordered lo transfer matrix operator at euclidean time step @xmath18 is @xmath19 : , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 where the spin vector @xmath6 and the isospin vector @xmath21 indices range from 1 to 3 , the parameter @xmath22 is the ratio of temporal and spatial lattice spacings , @xmath23 is the lattice gradient along direction @xmath6 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the operator @xmath25 is the total nucleon density @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the spin density @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the isospin density @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the isospin density @xmath32 .",
    "the couplings @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 satisfy @xmath37 such that the smeared contact interactions only contribute to even - parity channels , where we have antisymmetry in spin and symmetry in isospin ( or _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "the pmc calculations are performed with auxiliary fields coupled to each of the densities @xmath25 , @xmath27 , @xmath29 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the lo auxiliary - field transfer matrix at euclidean time step @xmath38 is @xmath39 where the physical values of the lo operator coefficients are such that all factors inside the square root symbols in eq .",
    "( [ aux_trans ] ) are positive .",
    "we now also define an su(4 ) symmetric transfer matrix , @xmath40 : ,   \\label{trans_4a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the associated coupling constant .",
    "again , we can rewrite the interaction using auxiliary fields , giving @xmath43 let us now consider the projection amplitude we obtain for an @xmath3-body slater determinant initial state @xmath44 with an auxiliary - field transfer matrix @xmath45 .",
    "the projection amplitude is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 matrix we obtain from the single nucleon amplitudes @xmath49 let us define @xmath50 $ ] as the set of unitary matrices such that @xmath51 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath46 is positive semi - definite if there exists some antisymmetric matrix @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the proof follows from the fact that the spectra of @xmath53 and @xmath54 must coincide , and the real spectrum of @xmath53 must be doubly degenerate as a result of the antisymmetry of @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this result is that the projection amplitude @xmath46 is positive semi -",
    "definite if there exists a unitary operator @xmath56 $ ] for all @xmath57 and if the action of @xmath55 on the single - particle states @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 can be represented as an antisymmetric @xmath61 matrix .",
    "we note that @xmath62 $ ] contains the spin and isospin matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "pmc calculations with the su(4)-symmetric theory are then free from sign oscillations whenever the initial single nucleon states are paired into spin singlets or isospin singlets  @xcite .",
    "we may then define the `` interpolating hamiltonian '' @xmath65 as @xmath66 which depends on @xmath7 as well as the ( unphysical ) coupling constant @xmath67 .",
    "this can also be viewed as giving the interaction parameters a linear dependence on @xmath7 , @xmath68 by taking @xmath69 , we can always decrease the sign problem to a tolerable level , while simultaneously tuning @xmath67 to a value favorable for an extrapolation @xmath11 .",
    "most significantly , we can make use of the constraint that the physical result at @xmath8 should be independent of @xmath67 .",
    "the dependence of calculated matrix elements on @xmath7 is smooth in the vicinity of @xmath8 . in what follows",
    ", we shall explore the properties of @xmath65 for various nuclei of physical interest , and determine to what extent it can be used to circumvent the sign problem , which at @xmath8 becomes exponentially severe in the limit of large euclidean time .",
    "we note that an extrapolation technique similar to sse has been used in shell model monte carlo calculations for over two decades  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the extrapolation is performed by decomposing the hamiltonian into `` good sign '' and `` bad sign '' parts , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the calculations are then performed by multiplying the coefficients of @xmath71 by a parameter @xmath72 and extrapolating from @xmath73 , where the simulations are free from sign oscillations , to the physical point @xmath74 . for sse ,",
    "the analysis in terms of `` good '' and `` bad '' signs is not the entire story .",
    "most of the interactions can be divided into two groups which are `` sign free '' by themselves , such that a large portion of the sign oscillations is due to interference between the different underlying symmetries of the two groups of interactions .",
    "since this effect is quadratic in the interfering interaction coefficients , the growth of the sign problem is more gradual .",
    "we therefore expect to be able to extrapolate from values not so far away from the physical point @xmath8 .",
    "the lo auxiliary - field transfer matrix @xmath75 contains pion interactions with the matrix structure @xmath76 acting on single nucleon states , and smeared contact interactions with matrix structures @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . since @xmath81,\\ , { \\cal u}_*[i\\sigma_s^ { } ] , \\ , { \\cal u}_*[i\\tau_2^ { } ] , \\ , { \\cal u}_*[i\\sigma_s^{}\\tau_1^ { } ] , \\ , { \\cal u}_*[i\\sigma_s^{}\\tau_3^ { } ] , \\label{sigma_2 } \\\\",

    "the only interaction matrix structures in @xmath75 not included in both eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_2 ] ) and  ( [ sigma_2tau_3 ] ) are @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the sign oscillations in @xmath46 will be produced by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and the interference between the two sets of interactions in eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_2 ] ) and  ( [ sigma_2tau_3 ] ) . for initial states where",
    "the neutrons and protons can not be paired into spin - singlets , there will be additional sign oscillations due to these unpaired nucleons .",
    "however , the number of such unpaired nucleons can often be kept to a minimum .",
    "we shall first discuss our results for the @xmath0c nucleus , as this provides us with a convenient test case for the sse method .",
    "we extend the pmc calculation to larger values of the euclidean projection time than would otherwise be possible , and verify how well these new results agree with earlier calculations .",

    "the interpolating lines are intended as a guide to the eye . ]",
    "the sse method introduced here is inspired by the existence of an su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonian which provides a reasonably accurate description of the physics of the full chiral eft hamiltonian .",
    "this has already proven useful in earlier work , as it greatly facilitates finding an accurate initial wave function which minimizes the extent of euclidean time projection necessary with the full hamiltonian .",
    "we have here illustrated how this concept can be taken one step further , by studying a weighted sum of physical and su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonians . in this way , the sign problem could be arbitrarily ameliorated , at the price of introducing an extrapolation in a control parameter @xmath11 . in practice",
    ", this means that the sse method is only useful as long as the extrapolation errors can be kept under control .",
    "naturally , performing simulations at a range of values of @xmath7 has the potential to multiply the required cpu time by a large factor .",
    "however , we have found that we are able to avoid an exponential increase in computation time as a function of euclidean projection time , as long as we are able to perform simulations for @xmath112 , as the accuracy of extrapolation then remains comparable with the statistical errors of typical simulations at @xmath8 .",
    "we have also explored the freedom in the choice of the su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonian , which clearly plays no role at @xmath8 , but which in general gives different results for @xmath90 .",
    "we have therefore made use of a `` triangulation '' method to improve the accuracy of the extrapolation @xmath11 .",
    "an important consideration is whether a continuous shift from an su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonian to the full chiral eft hamiltonian can be effected without inducing non - trivial changes in the spectrum .",
    "for instance , the appearance of a level crossing at a critical value of @xmath7 would clearly limit the applicability of sse .",
    "we note that such level crossings as a function of @xmath7 would be quite rare for low - lying nuclear bound states , and furthermore we have the freedom to choose @xmath67 to avoid such level crossings .",
    "but if a level crossing were to occur , there would be some subtleties in obtaining accurate and converged results .",
    "for such cases , it would be preferable to take the @xmath11 limit first , followed by extrapolation in euclidean time . an even better solution would entail solving a coupled - channel problem using multiple initial states .",
    "this makes it possible to disentangle one or more nearly degenerate states with the same quantum numbers .",
    "so far , we have concentrated on systems where such degeneracies are not expected , and where pmc is still possible ( though difficult ) without the sse method .",
    "we have also not yet explored different `` extrapolation hamiltonians '' , where the sign oscillations are minimized while retaining as much as possible of the full chiral eft structure .    in this first report on the sse method",
    ", we have presented extensive results for @xmath1he and @xmath0c , for a wide range of @xmath7 and su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonians . for the case of @xmath1he",
    ", we have first extrapolated all results to infinite euclidean time , followed by an extrapolation @xmath11 . for the case of @xmath0c",
    ", we have performed the extrapolation @xmath11 directly for data at finite euclidean projection time . in both cases",
    ", we find similar behavior as a function of @xmath7 and excellent linearity in the vicinity of @xmath8 .",
    "which ordering of the limits is preferable depends on how severe the sign problem is for a given system at @xmath8 . in cases where the sign problem is severe ,",
    "the method of first taking the limit @xmath11 followed by an extrapolation in euclidean time is preferable .",
    "this is because the euclidean time extrapolation may be ambiguous if only very short euclidean times are accessible with pmc .",
    "our results provide the first determination of the ground state energy of @xmath1he using lattice chiral eft , and for @xmath0c we find that our new results at larger euclidean projection time agree very well with previous infinite - time extrapolations .",
    "we have presented here the first studies of the binding energy of @xmath1he within lattice chiral eft .",
    "while the results are very encouraging for the feasibility of calculations for neutron - rich systems , we also find that @xmath1he appears underbound by @xmath93  mev at nnlo .",
    "nevertheless , since the present calculations are performed in an @xmath134 box , the possibility remains that finite volume effects could significantly improve on the current situation .",
    "in particular , since @xmath135-wave states are underbound in a finite volume  @xcite while @xmath6-wave states are overbound , calculations in larger boxes ( or extrapolations to @xmath136 ) would shed more light on this situation .",
