    "the three - body decay of many - body resonances can be accurately measured in complete kinematics .",
    "information about the decaying state and the decay mechanism is usually extracted from the measurement of the three fragments after the decay .",
    "although this is a common practice , the situation is ambiguous .",
    "the experimental analyses of these processes are based on the @xmath3-matrix formalism which inherently assumes two successive two - body decays .",
    "the input are the properties of the intermediate two - body states and the population of the nuclear many - body initial state approximated as a three - body system .",
    "occasionally , in principle contrary descriptions are able to explain the observed distributions making the understanding of the underlying physics difficult .",
    "an example demonstrating the difficulties is the @xmath4 decay of @xmath5 state in @xmath1c which was successfully described by two opposite mechanisms : a sequential decay via the @xmath6 state in @xmath7be @xcite , and a direct decay into the three - body continuum @xcite .",
    "this requires an explanation .",
    "what information is contained in a full - kinematics measurement of three - body decay ?",
    "apparently unique information can only be extracted under favorable conditions .",
    "the crux of the matter is that the decay mechanism is related to a `` decay path '' , an intermediate structure , which in contrast to the final state signal in the detector is not an observable .",
    "we shall in this contribution compare the results from three - body calculations and experimental @xmath3-matrix analyses .",
    "the large - distance observable structure of the many - body initial state is a three - body continuum state , therefore we compute the resonance structure in a three - body cluster model @xcite .",
    "we use the complex scaled hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method to solve the faddeev equations which describe the 3-body system .",
    "the appropriate coordinates are the so - called hyperspherical coordinates and consist of the hyperradius @xmath8 , and five hyperangles . in the adiabatic hyperspherical expansion method the angular part of the faddeev equations",
    "is solved first and the angular eigenfunctions @xmath9 are then used as a basis to expand the total wave function @xmath10 .",
    "we include short - range @xcite and coulomb potentials .",
    "the many - body effects that are present at short distances are assumed to be unimportant except for the resonance energy .",
    "this is taken into account by using a structureless 3-body interaction that fits the position of the resonance .",
    "the resonance wave - function contains information about the decay mechanism , and the large - distance properties reflect directly the measurable fragment momentum distributions .",
    "the single particle probability distributions are obtained after integration of the absolute square of the wave function over the four hyperangles describing the directions of the momenta .",
    "l6.5 cm    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab ]",
    "we have computed the observable momentum distributions from decay of three - body resonances by use of @xmath3-matrix simulations and from full faddeev calculations .",
    "we have considered the example of the @xmath2 resonance of @xmath1c .",
    "the angular momentum and boson symmetries constrain the resulting momentum distributions .",
    "the same measured momentum distributions can be described in different complete basis sets , e.g. either direct products of two - body states and their center - of - mass motion relative to the third particle ( @xmath3-matrix ) or three - body continuum wave functions ( faddeev ) .",
    "the fact that different descriptions seem to work indicates that the same wave function could be described in different ways .",
    "extracting information of both structure and decay mechanism can then be misleading and requires model interpretations .",
    "full faddeev computations successfully reproduce the measured distributions ."
