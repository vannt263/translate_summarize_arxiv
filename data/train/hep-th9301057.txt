    "<S> we propose an approach to statistical systems on lattices with sphere - like topology . focusing on the ising model </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the thermodynamic limit along a sequence of lattices which preserve the _ fixed _ large scale geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of scaling appears to hold at criticality , pointing at a sensible definition of the continuum limit of the model in the curved space .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    pacs numbers : 05.20 , 05.50    -17.0 cm    the elucidation of the effects of gravity on statistical systems has already deserved a lot of attention . the discussion has been mainly centered on the influence of quantizing the spatial geometry of two - dimensional statistical models at criticality . the determination of the gravitational dressing of conformal weights can be considered one of the most important theoretical breakthroughs of the past decade . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that it was first achieved in the light - cone gauge formulation of quantum gravity @xcite , and later by use of conformal field theory methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical problem which is adressed by this study is that of considering cooperative phenomena on a fluctuating surface , and it is in this kind of setting that the gravitational scaling dimensions have been confirmed by the method of dynamical triangulation of random surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a different topic arises , however , by considering the effect on the critical behaviour of a fixed spatial geometry . in this respect , it is important to stress that the effects of curvature have not been assessed on statistical systems . </S>",
    "<S> since these are made of a discrete number of lattice points , the main drawback in posing the problem concerns the way in which the thermodynamic limit can be approached keeping fixed the spatial geometry . focusing in two - dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> it is not obvious how to enforce this constraint , specially when the mean curvature over the surface is positive . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to having a positive euler number , which forces the topology to be that of the sphere . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this is the first case of interest since quite significant physical systems are already known which realize the above condition on the curvature , from a simplicial point of view . </S>",
    "<S> the most notorious instance is the buckminsterfullerene , the molecule with sixty carbon atoms placed at the vertices of a truncated icosahedron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , carbon aggregates have been discovered in which each shell has an increasing number of atoms disposed on a closed lattice of sphere - like topology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these kind of systems invite to open the study of statistical properties in the presence of nonvanishing curvature .    from the theoretical point of view , the basic question is to give a growing pattern by which a lattice can be built systematically from a previous one , keeping the same distribution of the curvature on the new scale . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose a definition of the thermodynamic limit along some simple classes of two - dimenional lattices with the topology of the sphere . according to simplicial geometry , </S>",
    "<S> one assigns to every lattice face with number of vertices @xmath0 the surface element @xmath1 and a value of the curvature given by @xmath2 the search for the mentioned growing pattern leads to consider hexagonal lattices with a finite number of defects . </S>",
    "<S> let us constrain the problem by allowing only convex ( @xmath3 ) dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these have to be placed according to the spatial orientation of the vertices of the tetrahedron , the octahedron or the icosahedron . to be more precise , </S>",
    "<S> the lattices we consider have as building blocks triangular pieces of honeycomb lattice of the type shown in figure 1 , which are to be assembled as the faces of the given regular polyhedron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when this is done , we end up with a closed lattice with constant coordination number in which all the curvature is concentrated at a finite number of locations . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to four three - fold rings in the case of the tetrahedron , six four - fold rings in the octahedron and twelve five - fold rings in the icosahedron . </S>",
    "<S> given the polyhedron , though , the family of lattices of this type embeded on its surface has an infinite number of members , with their linear dimension increasing as an integer multiple of the smallest one . in the case of the tetrahedron , for instance </S>",
    "<S> , the first lattice has 12 points those of a truncated tetrahedron , the next has 48 points , and so on following the general rule that the @xmath4 generation of the family has @xmath5 lattice points . the important point in this construction </S>",
    "<S> is that for all the members of a given family the curvature is distributed in the same way on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> actually , in the thermodynamic limit we are dealing with a kind of discrete version of an orbifold , that is , a degenerate manifold in which all the curvature is concentrated at a finite number of points the vertices of the regular polyhedron . </S>",
    "<S> when dealing with a given statistical model on these lattices , it becomes plausible the physical picture that changing from a generation to another inside the same family amounts to consider the same system , just with a different length scale . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of scaling is susceptible of being checked on suitable observables , and for this purpose precise measurements are presented below in the case of a simple system .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus in what follows on the ising model formulated over the family of lattices embeded on the tetrahedron . in the case of the ising model </S>",
    "<S> we may take advantage of powerful techniques developed for the computation of partition functions . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to the dimer formulation of the problem , which we now briefly review @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given a collection of spins @xmath6 , with @xmath7 running over all the lattice points , the knowledge of the partition function @xmath8 requires performing the sum over all posible configurations @xmath9 where the sum in the hamiltonian runs over all the lattice links @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of the high - temperature expansion about @xmath11 leads to the alternative expression @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total number of links , @xmath14 stands for the collection of all the closed nonintersecting loops on the lattice and @xmath15 is the respective number of links for each of them . </S>",
    "<S> the dimer approach manages to compute this sum by translating it into the evaluation of pfaffians of suitable antisymmetric operators . </S>",
    "<S> this is done as follows . </S>",
    "<S> one has first to consider the decorated lattice , which in our case is formed by inserting a triangle in place of each of the points of the original lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a typical decorated lattice looks as that depicted in figure 2 , which corresponds to the lattice of the second generation . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall the definition of elementary polygon and the notion of clockwise odd polygon in the decorated lattice . </S>",
    "<S> elementary polygons are those which do not contain lattice points in their interior . an orientation may be assigned to each of the links of the decorated lattice , which is represented for practical purposes by drawing corresponding arrows on them . </S>",
    "<S> a polygon is said to be clockwise odd when the number of arrows pointing in the clockwise direction on the polygon is odd . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , there is always a manner of disposing the arrows on the lattice as to render all the elementary polygons clockwise odd . on a planar lattice all </S>",
    "<S> the work is done by finding one of these systems of arrows . </S>",
    "<S> kasteleyn theorem @xcite assures then that the combinatorics of the sum in ( [ 12 ] ) can be reproduced by computing the pfaffian of a single antisymmetric operator @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this is given by a coordination matrix on the decorated lattice , such that @xmath17 is positive if an arrow goes from @xmath7 to @xmath18 and negative in the opposite case . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19-dependence of the sum is fixed by taking the absolute value of matrix elements for triangle links equal to @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 ) , and the absolute value of the rest equal to @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> our lattices embedded on the tetrahedron fall into the category of planar lattices , so that kasteleyn theorem is at work . </S>",
    "<S> there are some minor details concerning the possibility of defining an order relation and the so - called transition cycles on our lattices , which can be elaborated without much complication . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of interest in ( [ 12 ] ) can be represented by the square root of the determinant of some antisymmetric operator @xmath16 following the steps given above . </S>",
    "<S> there is , in fact , a systematic way of forming a system of arrows making all elementary polygons clockwise odd , generation after generation . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 illustrates a particularly convenient way of superposing the decorated lattices on the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows on the triangle links may all be chosen clockwise , while those connecting triangles follow the regular pattern shown in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> there are only a reduced number of arrows along the boundary which can not conform to this rule and have to be fixed to make all elementary polygons clockwise odd . in general , progressing in the family of lattices from one generation to the next amounts to add a row of hexagons at the top and another at the bottom in the representation of figure 2 , expanding accordingly the horizontal dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed system of arrows along the boundary follows also a regular pattern beginning at each three - fold ring , which makes the construction very simple for arbitrarily large lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> once we have determined the system of arrows for a given lattice , it only remains the technical problem of computing the determinant of the corresponding antisymmetric operator @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function is given now by @xmath23 a direct symbolic computation of the determinant of @xmath16 can not be achieved in a reasonable amount of time beyond the first generation , which already requires to handle a determinant of order 36 . </S>",
    "<S> we have deviced a trick , however , which makes possible the exact computation of the partition function at least up to the third generation . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that for the kind of operators we are dealing with @xmath24 is a polynomial in the variable @xmath25 , whose determination demands only the knowledge of a finite number of coefficients . for any of our lattices </S>",
    "<S> the degree of the polynomial equals the total number of lattice points @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be checked by noticing that it always exists a closed nonintersecting path which goes through all the points in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> once it is known that the polynomial @xmath24 has degree @xmath26 for each lattice , we only need to perform a number of evaluations @xmath26 of this quantity at different values of @xmath27 to identify all the coefficients ( the zeroth order term of the polynomial is obviously equal to @xmath22 ) . from a technical point of view , the coefficients are integer numbers and can be computed without error by sufficiently precise evaluations of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out this program up to the third generation of lattices by using @xmath28 . in practice , what we have done at each generation is to compute with full precision the square root of the determinant at values @xmath29 , for which the result of the operation is itself an integer . </S>",
    "<S> then by solving a linear system the exact coefficients of the polynomial are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function of the ising model for the first generation lattice of 12 points is , for instance , @xmath30 for the lattice of the second generation the partition function turns out to be @xmath31 for these first two generations the alternative method of counting polygonal paths on the lattice can be worked out , producing the same respective high - temperature series as shown above . </S>",
    "<S> our computational approach appears to be much more efficient , however , starting with the lattice of the third generation . </S>",
    "<S> after about 98 hours of cpu time on a silicon graphics 4d/480s , we have obtained the coefficients of the high - temperature series for the lattice of 108 points . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the partition function is given in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of having at our disposal the analytic expressions of the partition functions is that they allow us to address some questions with great precision . </S>",
    "<S> one of them refers to the location of the zeroes of the partition functions in the @xmath27 complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> these are plotted , for the lattices of the second and third generations , in figures 3 and 4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the frustration of the lattice clearly reflects in the lack of symmetry of both partition functions under the exchange @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the evolution of the zeroes in the complex plane points to the formation of two accumulation points on the real axis in the limit of large lattices , which signal the development of two critical points respectively in the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic domain .    </S>",
    "<S> the inspection of the first derivatives of the free energy furnishes also clear evidence of critical behaviour in the thermodynamic limit . in figure 5 </S>",
    "<S> we show a plot of the second derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath19 , for the first three generations . at each generation </S>",
    "<S> we are able to define a certain `` critical '' coupling constant , within each domain , as that at which the specific heat reaches its maximum . </S>",
    "<S> let us focus , for instance , in the ferromagnetic domain ( @xmath33 ) , where the critical behaviour has an early development . </S>",
    "<S> the critical coupling constants for lattices up to the sixth generation ( 432 points ) are given in table 1 , along with the corresponding values of the specific heat at the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the values for the fourth , fifth and sixth generations result from extensive numerical computations carried on the representation ( [ 13 ] ) of the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of finite size effects allows to check if the scaling hypothesis applies for the lattices in the curved space , being therefore helpful in the computation of critical exponents . regarding the behaviour of the finite size critical coupling constant @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , the standard argument says that its difference with respect to the value in the thermodynamic limit @xmath35 is fixed by the point at which the correlation length @xmath36 reaches the characteristic length dimension @xmath37 of the lattice . in terms of the @xmath38 critical exponent </S>",
    "<S> we should have @xmath39 we give in figure 6 the logarithmic plot of @xmath40 versus the generation number @xmath41 , that is also the appropriate length scale of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that @xmath35 coincides with the critical coupling constant of the ising model on a planar honeycomb lattice , whose value is @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> quite remarkably , the correlation of the points in the plot is manifest , including those corresponding to the smaller lattices . </S>",
    "<S> this provides full support to the scaling law ( [ 16 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the linear fit for the four bigger lattices in the plot gives a value @xmath43 , with an uncertainty of about 10% . </S>",
    "<S> a significant drift from this value should not be discarded for bigger lattices , though the investigation of this point requires finer computational techniques . </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis can be applied to the divergence of the specific heat . under the assumption of scaling </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum value of the finite size specific heat @xmath44 has to follow the law @xcite @xmath45 a logarithmic plot of the values for the specific heat in table 1 shows again a proper linear correlation including the first six generations . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent which arises from the linear fit is , however , rather small ( @xmath46 taking into account the last four generations ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small number of lattices under consideration makes impossible to discern whether the correct critical behaviour follows a power law of the type ( [ 17 ] ) or is , in fact , logarithmic . the progression to fairly big lattices may be the only way to shed light on this question .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed an approach to the introduction of curvature on two - dimensional statistical systems in which the size of the spatial lattice may be increased keeping fixed the large scale geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed it studying the ising model in particular , showing that the hypothesis of scaling holds near the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the point of view that the thermodynamic limit taken along our sequence of lattices provides a sensible definition of the _ continuum limit _ of the ising model on a two - dimensional curved space . </S>",
    "<S> it would be nice to have an alternative field theory description of this limit , specially if one were to confirm unusual critical exponents for the specific heat , the spontaneous magnetization or the susceptibility of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the precise determination of these requires further work , as well as a different computational approach . </S>",
    "<S> the study of finite size effects through the family of lattices proposed appears to be worth not only at criticality , but also to investigate possible integrability properties off - criticality .    </S>",
    "<S> we are indebted to m. a. h. vozmediano for her appreciated contribution at the early stages of this work . </S>",
    "<S> we want to thank also e. marino , b. nachtergaele and j. salas for useful comments . </S>",
