    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors is the most significant breakthrough in the condensed matter physics in recent years@xcite .",
    "the iron - pnictides / chacogenides are close to magnetism and it is widely believed that the spin - fluctuation is responsible for the pairing of the superconducting electrons@xcite . compared with the iron - based compounds , the nickel - based systems have much lower critical temperature , for example , laonip ( @xmath4@xcite , laonias ( @xmath5@xcite , bani@xmath0p@xmath0 ( @xmath6@xcite , bani@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath7@xcite , usually lower than 5 k even upon doping@xcite . to date",
    ", no evidence for ordered or even fluctuated magnetism associated with ni in proximity to superconductivity is found .",
    "moreover , the majority of evidence suggests that the ni - based systems can be understood in context of conventional electron - phonon theory@xcite .",
    "recently , there nickel chalcogenides kni@xmath0se@xmath0 ( @xmath8@xcite , kni@xmath0s@xmath0 ( @xmath9@xcite , and tlni@xmath0se@xmath0(@xmath10@xcite were reported , in which superconductivity appears to involve heavy - fermion behavior below a coherent temperature @xmath11@xmath1220 k. in contrast to k@xmath13fe@xmath14se@xmath0@xcite , tlni@xmath0se@xmath0compound is homogeneous without ni vacancy or phase separation@xcite . considering the monovalent tl or k in the stoichiometry composition",
    ", the effective valance of ni in such compound is `` 1.5 + '' .",
    "the mixed valency of @xmath15 was proposed to induce the heavy effective band mass@xcite . however , very recently , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurement@xcite reveals that tlni@xmath0se@xmath0shares a universal band structure with bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite and baco@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite , with a chemical potential shifted due to more @xmath16 electrons in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0(3@xmath17 ) than in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath18 and baco@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , it can be viewed as heavily electron doped tlfe@xmath0se@xmath0 ( @xmath20 , with reduced electronic correlations than in its cousin k@xmath13fe@xmath14se@xmath0@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the camelback - shaped band at z point gives rise to a pronounced van hove singularity ( vhs ) near fermi energy ( @xmath21 ) , which provides a natural explanation to the heavy electrons behavior inferred from the electronic heat and the upper critical field measurements@xcite in this weakly correlated system .",
    "more specially , the neutron pair - distribution - function ( pdf ) analysis in a combined high - resolution synchrotron x - ray diffraction and neutron scattering study in kni@xmath0se@xmath0 reveals that the local charge density wave ( cdw ) state is present up to 300 k but disappears on cooling in the `` heavy - fermion '' state below @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the effect is opposite to what is typically observed .",
    "moreover the arpes did not observe any anomaly in the spectra upon entering the fluctuating cdw state@xcite . to understand the unique behavior , it is highly desirable to investigate the charge dynamics in the whole temperature range below 300 k.    optical spectroscopy",
    "is a powerful bulk sensitive technique with high energy resolution , which is widely used to probe the carrier dynamics and possible gap formation of an electronic system . in this work",
    ", we present a detailed optical spectroscopy study on tlni@xmath0se@xmath0single crystals .",
    "our optical data reveals that tlni@xmath0se@xmath0is a good metal with a distinct plasma reflectance edge , similar to its isostructure bani@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the overall frequency dependent reflectivity @xmath2 is gradually suppressed near 2500 @xmath22with decreasing temperature , and a pseudogap feature appears at any temperature below 300 k. the weak gap structure is attributed to the local cdw order or fluctuations .",
    "our measurement indicates that the local cdw order / fluctuations are further enhanced at the lowest temperature , which is different from the neutron pdf analysis on kni@xmath0se@xmath0 in its `` heavy fermion state '' . in combination with the earlier arpes results",
    ", we suggest that the fluctuating cdw instability is driven by the presence of saddle points in band structure which leads to the van hove singularity close to the fermi level .",
    "single crystals of tlni@xmath0se@xmath0were grown by the self - flux method@xcite . their structure , transport , magnetic and thermodynamic properties were already reported@xcite .",
    "the frequency - dependent reflectance spectra at different temperature were measured by bruker ifs 113v and 80v spectrometers in the frequency range from 30 to 20 000 @xmath22(4 mev@xmath122.5 ev ) , and then the reflectance was extended to 50 000 @xmath22(@xmath126.1 ev ) at room temperature with a grating - type spectrometer .",
    "an _ in situ _ gold and aluminum overcoating technique was used to obtain the reflectivity r(@xmath23 ) . considering the small size of our samples , the data below 100 @xmath22are cut off for reliability .",
    "the real part of conductivity @xmath3 is obtained by the kramers - kronig transformation of r(@xmath23 ) .",
    "the hagen - rubens relation was used for low frequency extrapolation ; at high frequency side , an extrapolation method using x - ray atomic scattering functions was applied to generate the high - frequency reflectivity@xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the reflectance spectra of tlni@xmath0se@xmath0single crystals over a broad energy scale at various temperatures .",
    "the value of r(@xmath23 ) approaches unity towards zero energy and shows an increase with decreasing temperature , indicating a good metallic behavior . by lowering the temperature",
    ", we do not see any sharp changes in the optical spectra but rather weak suppression of r(@xmath23 ) near 2500 @xmath22 , signaling the opening of a partial gap ( pseudogap ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath23 , r(@xmath23 ) drops quickly near 7000 @xmath22 , known as the screened plasma edge .",
    "the relativity high edge position reveals a high carrier density , which is similar to isostructural compound , bani@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "there is another edge structure at about 15 000 @xmath22which is caused by an interband transition .",
    "the reflectivity becomes roughly temperature independent at higher frequencies .",

    "the drude - type conductivity is observed for all spectra at low frequency and several temperature - independent interband transitions could be also well resolved , as shown in the inset of figure 2 .",
    "the optical conductivity between 500 and 10 000 @xmath22is gradually suppressed and a broad peak - like feature becomes more and more obvious at 2800 @xmath22as the temperature decreases .",
    "the spectral line shape is similar to that of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite across the sdw transition though the feature is much weaker .",
    "it seems to suggest that there should also be a density - wave gap opening in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , this pseudogap feature is most prominent at low temperature and can be resolved even in the 300 k data .    to quantify the temperature evolution of optical conductivity , especially the low frequency components",
    ", we use a simple drude - lorentz model to decompose optical conductivity spectra@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the plasma frequency and the relaxation rate of each conduction band , while @xmath27 , @xmath28 and _ s@xmath29 _ are the resonance frequency , the damping and the mode strength of each lorentz oscillator , respectively .",
    "this model includes drude and lorentz terms , which approximately capture the contribution by free carriers and interband transitions .",
    "both transport@xcite and arpes@xcite results suggest the multiband character of tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 , therefore we applied two drude components analysis here , similar to the other members of `` 122 '' system@xcite . even though the drude - lorentz fit is somewhat arbitrary and the accuracy of the derived fit parameters is uncertain , it will not modify the key outcomes of the analysis .    at different temperatures .",

    "furthermore , an additional midinfrared peak is necessary near about 2800 @xmath22at any temperature below 300 k. we are mainly concerned about the evolution of the low energy conductivity , therefore the fitting parameters for the the two drude components are shown in the table 1 for different temperatures .",
    "we also show the error bars of the fitting parameters corresponding to an absolute error of 0.5% in reflectivity .",
    "we find that the two drude components narrow with decreasing temperature due to the metallic response .",
    "the plasma frequency @xmath30 keeps roughly unchanged , while @xmath31 decreases suggesting that the gapping of the fermi surfaces mainly appears in the broad drude component .",
    "the lorentz 5 oscillator strength @xmath32 increases continuously with decreasing temperature , indicating the progressive formation of the absorption peaks just above the pseudogap .",
    "we use the formula @xmath33 to estimate the overall plasma frequency , then we get @xmath34 36360 @xmath22at 300 k , and 32400 @xmath22at 10 k , respectively . therefore , the ratio of the square of the plasma frequency at 10 k to that of 300 k is about 0.80 .",

    "if we assume that the effective mass of itinerant carriers would not change with temperature , the optical data reveals that roughly 20% of the itinerant carriers is lost due to the pseudogap opening at the fermi surface .     at 300 and 10",

    "the optical spectral weight is defined as @xmath45 . for the convenience of comparison",
    ", we also present the low - temperature integrated spectral weight of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the strong dip below 1000 @xmath22represents the formation of sdw gap in the magnetic ordered state@xcite , while the second dip near 3000 @xmath22reflects the unconventional sw transfer at high energy which seems to be a common feature in iron - pnictides / chacogenides@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 , the temperature - dependent spectral change are very different .",
    "the sw ratio exceeds 1 before it recovers to unity suggesting that the sw is transferred from high to low energy at low temperature .",
    "we should remark that most of the sw below 6000 @xmath22(the minimum of optical conductivity ) would come from the intraband transitions .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the sw transformation from high to low energy is induced by the drude components narrowing .",
    "this is the typical optical response of a metallic material . on the other hand",
    ", the pseudogap develops below 2000 @xmath22at low temperature .",
    "however , we note that the effects of the pseudogap formation to the sw transfer are minimal .",
    "it is the metallic response that leads to the sw transfer to low energy . in other words ,",
    "the pseudogap is too weak to change the sw evolution in such a good metal .",
    "notably , the sw of the mid - infrared peak could not fully compensate for the loss of the low - energy drude component , and the recovery of sw extends to fairly high energy scale .",
    "furthermore , the high energy sw transfer above 8000 @xmath22is almost undistinguishable in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "this may be related to the weaker correlation or hund s coupling effect in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0as compared to @xmath37 , in agreement with the arpes results@xcite .    in order to make the pseudogap - like suppression more clear",
    ", we also plot a model ratio of the low - temperature integrated sw to the model integrated spectral weight at 10 k. assuming that tlni@xmath0se@xmath0is a pure metal without the pseudogap feature , the model optical conductivity at 10 k could be obtained according to the drude - lorentz model with two drude components and four lorentz components , as the situation at 300 k .",
    "the parameters of the model optical conductivity are listed in table 1 , where @xmath38 is set to 217 @xmath22 in order to keep the same dc optical conductivity as the real data and @xmath31 is set to 30100 @xmath22to conserve the total spectral weight at 10 k. we then normalize the integrated sw at low temperature sw(10 k ) to the model value msw(10 k ) . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 , the ratio decrease below @xmath461700 @xmath22 , suggesting that the sw is depleted due to opening of the pseudogap , and the suppressed sw is transferred to higher energy , leading to the gradually recovery of the sw above the pseudogap .",
    "this is a typical behavior of gap opening induced sw transformation .",
    "now we can summarize the main finding of our optical data : the overall optical spectra are similar to those observed in its isostructure @xmath1 .",
    "corresponding to the weak suppression of @xmath2 , the real part of the conductivity @xmath3 shows a suppression roughly below 2000 @xmath22 , which leads to a peak above this energy .",
    "the mid - infrared peak is present at all measurement temperatures below 300 k , and becomes more and more obvious with decreasing temperature , indicating the gradual formation of pseudogap . at the same time , irrespective of the uncertainly , the overall plasma frequency decreases , implying the partial gap opening on the fermi surface , which gives a further proof of the pseudogap formation .",
    "in particular , the sw transformation to higher energy induced by pseudogap could be clearly observed in the model ratio , where we use the metallic response at 10 k as a reference .    as we have mentioned above ,",
    "for kni@xmath0se@xmath0 or kni@xmath0s@xmath0 , the neutron pdf analysis suggested that the local cdw fluctuations are present at high temperature but disappear upon further cooling@xcite .",
    "however , our optical data of tlni@xmath0se@xmath0single crystals reveals the progressive formation of pseudogap in the midinfrared range , especially below @xmath11 .",
    "to understand the origin of pseudogap in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0crystals , there are also a few other experimental facts which should be taken into account .",
    "first , to date no evidence for magnetic transition was found on such nickel chalcogenides .",
    "second , no static density wave , such as cdw or sdw , has been observed .",
    "third , the anisotropy in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0is rather small , although the compound has a layer structure .",
    "it looks like that the pseudogap in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0might be originated from local cdw fluctuations , in agreement with earlier neutron measurement on kni@xmath0se@xmath0 and kni@xmath0s@xmath0@xcite .",
    "moreover , the local cdw fluctuation was suggested to be entirely dynamic and/or spatially incoherent@xcite , in contrast to the coherence cdws observed in structurally related compounds such as _ 2h_-typed transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite . with such cdw fluctuation",
    ", there could be a partial gap - opening in k - space on the fermi surface , which could be related to the pseudogap feature in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "however , different from kni@xmath0se@xmath0 and kni@xmath0s@xmath0 where the fluctuated cdw order tends to disappear upon entering the heavy electron state at very low temperature , the optical measurement on tlni@xmath0se@xmath0indicates that the partial gap feature is further enhanced at the lowest temperature .",
    "an earlier angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement on kni@xmath0se@xmath0 crystals suggested the quasi - two - dimensional nature of the fermi surface and that the partial nested fermi surface might be responsible for the local cdw fluctuations@xcite .",
    "however , a more recent arpes measurements on tlni@xmath0se@xmath0revealed more complicated and three dimensional fermi surface shape .",
    "thus , a naive picture for a fs nesting scenario is not applicable here on tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , a camelback - shaped band near fermi energy at _ z _ point was identified , in particular , the existence of four flat part of the dispersion very close to @xmath21 would give rise to a pronounced van hove singularity ( vhs)@xcite . on this basis , the cdw instability can be naturally understood in the frame of `` saddle - point '' cdw mechanism , proposed by rice and scott@xcite .",
    "the four saddle points near _ z _ point in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0gives a divergent contribution to lindhard response function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a wave vector connecting two saddle points , leading to a cdw instability .",
    "we have performed optical spectroscopy study on tlni@xmath0se@xmath0over a broad frequency range at various temperatures .",
    "both the suppression in @xmath2 and the peaklike feature in @xmath3 suggest the progressive formation of a pseudogap feature in the midinfrared range with decreasing temperatures , which might be originated from the dynamic local fluctuation of charge - density - wave ( cdw ) instability .",
    "the cdw instability in tlni@xmath0se@xmath0may not be driven by fermi surface nesting , but by the saddle points mechanism , due to the exitance of van hove singularity very close to the fermi energy .",
