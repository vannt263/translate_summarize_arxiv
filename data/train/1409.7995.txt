    "recently , magnetic properties of graphene monolayers have attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "because of the characteristic electronic band structure with dirac - like linear dispersions near the fermi level ( @xmath4 ) and the resulting `` v - shape '' electronic density of states , @xmath5 , at @xmath4  @xcite , a unique electronic and magnetic behavior is expected in graphene . among many , very recent experiments have revealed that hydrogen or fluorine adatoms as well as vacancies in graphene can induce magnetic moments with spin 1/2 per adatom or vacancy  @xcite , although pristine graphene is diamagnetic .",
    "moreover , some experiments have observed the kondo - like signature in the temperature dependence of the resistivity when the vacancies are introduced in graphene  @xcite , even though the other experiments have found otherwise  @xcite .",
    "the early theoretical studies have considered a single magnetic impurity coupled to the graphene conduction electrons and found that the magnetic impurity is completely isolated , i.e. , unscreened by the conduction electrons , when the model preserves the particle - hole symmetry , while the magnetic moment can be screened when the model is strongly particle - hole asymmetric  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical results appear to contradict the experimental observation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the kondo temperature is found to be symmetric with respect to the applied gate voltage , which changes the chemical potential of the conduction electrons .",
    "therefore , the experiments indicate that the graphene with vacancies is close to the particle - hole symmetric point .",
    "however , the early theoretical studies predict no kondo screening in this limit  @xcite .    motivated by these experiments  @xcite ,",
    "several models have been recently proposed to explain the origin of magnetic moment and the possible kondo - like effect in graphene with structural defects or adatoms  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible explanations of the emergent magnetic moment in graphene with a structural defect is due to the partially filled dangling bonds of @xmath6 orbital on carbon atoms surrounding the vacancy  @xcite .",
    "it has been also pointed out that the scattering of defects drastically changes the electronic structures of @xmath7-band and produces the logarithmic divergence at @xmath4 in the local density of states at the vicinity of defects  @xcite .",
    "therefore a nonperturbative real - space theoretical approach that can incorporate the elaborate lattice geometry is highly desirable to understand the magnetic properties of graphene with structural defects or adatoms .",
    "the interests in the real - space aspects of magnetic impurities is not only to study geometrically different lattice structures of various systems but also to directly capture the real - space nature of the ground state , e.g. , the spatial distribution of `` kondo cloud '' in the kondo singlet state  @xcite . indeed , as compared to the thermodynamics and the transport properties , the real - space nature of kondo problem has been much less studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "however , very recently , scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments have successfully observed the long - range kondo signature for single magnetic atoms of fe and co in a cu(110 ) surface and found that the kondo cloud seems rather spatially extended away from the magnetic atoms  @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental progress further encourages us to study the magnetic impurity problems and the kondo physics in real space .",
    "theoretically , on the other hand , it is still difficult to study the real - space properties simply because the analytical approaches available are rather limited and also because even the most powerful and well accepted numerical method for magnetic impurity problems , i.e. , numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method  @xcite , can not treat the real - space dependence directly , where the high - energy scales are integrated out by using logarithmic discretization of energy .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods can calculate spatially dependent quantities  @xcite .",
    "however , the qmc calculations often suffer the negative sign problem at low temperatures and can not be applied to general anderson impurity models .    in the last decade ,",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite has been successfully used to investigate limited properties of single- and multiple - impurity anderson models .",
    "for example , the dmrg method has been applied to the single- and two - impurity anderson / kondo models in one dimension to study correlation effects in the conduction sites  @xcite and to evaluate the kondo screening length  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the dmrg method has been employed to address single- and multiple - impurity anderson models in more than one dimension  @xcite and also applied as an impurity solver for the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . however",
    ", these approaches encounter difficulties in calculating the spatially dependent quantities such as spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "therefore , it is highly desired to develop new numerical methods , which can compute directly various physical quantities in real space in any spatial dimensions .    to overcome the difficulties , here",
    "we introduce a block lanczos ( bl ) recursive technique , which constructs , without losing any geometrical information of the lattice , quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) models , suitable for dmrg calculations , from single- as well as multiple - impurity anderson models in any spatial dimensions .",
    "this new approach , named bl - dmrg method , enables us to calculate various physical quantities directly in real space , including both static and dynamical quantities , with high accuracy .",
    "thus the bl - dmrg method is in sharp contrast to the nrg method since the nrg method has a severe limitation in calculating the spatially dependent quantities because the logarithmic discretization in energy space has to be introduced to construct the wilson chain  @xcite .",
    "the bl - dmrg method is also superior to the qmc methods because the bl - dmrg method can be easily extended to a more involved impurity model such as a multiorbital single - impurity anderson model where intra- and interorbital coulomb interactions as well as hund s coupling and pair hopping interactions are included .",
    "therefore , the bl - dmrg method has potential as a promising impurity solver of dmft for multiorbital hubbard models  @xcite .    to demonstrate the bl - dmrg method",
    ", we apply this method to three different models for graphene with a structural defect and with a single absorbed atom , where a single anderson impurity is coupled to the conduction electrons in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "these models include ( i ) an anderson impurity absorbed on the honeycomb lattice ( model i ) , ( ii ) a substitutional anderson impurity in the honeycomb lattice ( model ii ) , and ( iii ) an effective model for a single carbon vacancy in graphene ( model iii ) .",
    "our results of the local magnetic susceptibility and the local density of states at the impurity site reveal that , for the particle - hole symmetric case at half - filling of electron density , the ground state of model i behaves as an isolated magnetic impurity with no kondo screening , while the ground state of models ii and iii forms a spin singlet state where the impurity moment is screened by the conduction electrons .",
    "to understand the real - space spin distribution of the conduction electrons around the impurity , we subsequently calculate the spin - spin correlation functions between the impurity site and the conduction sites and find a qualitatively different asymptotic behavior when compared with the noninteracting limit , which results from the different screening characteristics : the spin - spin correlations decay as @xmath0 , different from the noninteracting limit ( @xmath1 ) , for model i and as @xmath2 , exactly the same as the noninteracting limit , for models ii and iii .",
    "we also discuss the relevance of our results to the recent experiments on graphene with structural defects and with hydrogen or fluorine adatoms where the formation of local magnetic moments and the kondo - like behavior have been observed  @xcite .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : moam ] , and has significant advantages in calculating spatially dependent quantities and also in the computational cost by using the symmetry adapted bl bases .",

    "however , we emphasize that the use of bl recursive technique in the bl - dmrg method significantly enlarges the applicability of dmrg calculations not only to more general multiorbital single- or multiple - impurity anderson models but also to the calculations of spatially dependent quantities . moreover , as described in appendix  [ app : hybfunc ] , the bl bases representation of the hybridization function for general anderson impurity models further enlarges the usefulness of the bl recursive technique for other numerical methods such as the qmc methods and the nrg method .",
    "we consider a general anderson impurity model described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 here , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at site ( or orbital ) @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) with spin @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the conduction sites ( or bands ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at impurity site @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and orbital @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , denoted by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ) for simplicity , with spin @xmath15 .",

    "this q1d mapping can be achieved exactly without losing any geometrical information of the lattice by using the bl recursive technique , which is a straightforward extension of the basic lanczos recursive procedure  @xcite . to simplify the formulation ,",

    "on the other hand , in models ii and iii , @xmath383 and thus the theorem predicts that the ground state of these models is spin singlet , which is also in accordance with our numerical results .    we shall now discuss our results in comparison with the recent experiments on graphene . the experiments on graphene with hydrogen or fluorine adatoms as well as with structural defects ( vacancies ) have revealed that these systems carry magnetic moments with spin @xmath384 per adatom or vacancy and that these magnetic moments behave paramagnetically even at lowest temperatures  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these experiments strongly indicate that no kondo screening occurs . on the other hand , different experiments on graphene with vacancies",
    "have observed the kondo - like signature in the temperature dependence of the resistivity  @xcite .",
    "although we have focused only on single impurity models with the particle - hole symmetry at half filling , our results should be relevant to these experiments as long as the number of adatoms or vacancies are dilute .",
    "we have found that the magnetic moment is unscreened but rather isolated in the ground state of model i , which therefore can explain , at least qualitatively , the spin @xmath384 free moment per adatom observed experimentally on graphene with hydrogen or fluorine adatoms  @xcite . on the other hand , we have found that the ground state of model iii , a model for graphene with a single structural defect , is spin singlet and no free magnetic moment is found .",

    "first , it is reasonable that the impurity moment is screened to form the spin singlet ground state in model iii .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the number of electrons and the number of sites are both even in model iii and therefore the ground state is closed shell in the noninteracting limit .",
    "assuming the adiabatic evolution of the ground state with interaction @xmath196 , the ground state must be total spin @xmath385 unless the correlation induces a level cross between the ground state and a low - lying excited state . in the experiments",
    ", the number of electrons removed by introducing vacancies must be even ( i.e. , six electrons removed per vacancy ) , and thus the system easily forms a close shell state with the total spin @xmath385 or possibly nonzero integer spin , but not with @xmath386 .",
    "second , although our results for model iii seem to be consistent with the experimental observation in ref  @xcite , there is the following fundamental discrepancy . by controlling the number of electrons through gate voltage ,",
    "it is found experimentally that the highest kondo temperature appears away from half filling  @xcite .",
    "this observation seems contradict to our calculations because the diverging hybridization function @xmath387 at @xmath254 should induce the most tightly screened state and thus the highest kondo temperature at half filling , but not away from half filling , for model iii .",
    "the discrepancy between our results and the experiments as well as the disagreement between the two experiments suggest that the understanding of physics of graphene with vacancies and the corresponding magnetic properties would be beyond the simple model studied here and deserve further investigation both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "finally , we shall briefly comment on further possible extensions of the bl - dmrg method .",
    "the method is quite general and can be applied to general anderson impurity models in any spatial dimensions .",
    "one major advantage of this method is its flexibility for the form of the conduction hamiltonian . in this paper , we have studied anderson impurity models in the real - space representation .",

    "<S> we introduce a block lanczos ( bl ) recursive technique to construct quasi - one - dimensional models , suitable for density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations , from single- as well as multiple - impurity anderson models in any spatial dimensions . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the bl - dmrg method can be easily extended to treat a multiorbital anderson impurity model where not only inter- and intraorbital coulomb interactions but also hund s coupling and pair hopping interactions are included . we also show that the symmetry adapted bl bases can be utilized , when it is appropriate , to reduce the computational cost . as a demonstration , we apply the bl - dmrg method to three different models for graphene with a structural defect and with a single hydrogen or fluorine absorbed , where a single anderson impurity is coupled to conduction electrons in the honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> these models include ( i ) a single adatom on the honeycomb lattice , ( ii ) a substitutional impurity in the honeycomb lattice , and ( iii ) an effective model for a single carbon vacancy in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the local dynamical magnetic susceptibility and the local density of states at the impurity site reveals that , for the particle - hole symmetric case at half - filling of electron density , the ground state of model ( i ) behaves as an isolated magnetic impurity with no kondo screening , while the ground state of the other two models forms a spin - singlet state where the impurity moment is screened by the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the real - space dependence of the spin - spin correlation functions between the impurity site and the conduction sites for these three models . </S>",
    "<S> our results clearly show that , reflecting the presence or absence of unscreened magnetic moment at the impurity site , the spin - spin correlation functions decay as @xmath0 , differently from the noninteracting limit ( @xmath1 ) , for model ( i ) and as @xmath2 , exactly the same as the noninteracting limit , for models ( ii ) and ( iii ) in the asymptotic @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the distance between the impurity site and the conduction site . finally , based on our results , we shed light on recent experiments on graphene where the formation of local magnetic moments as well as the kondo - like behavior have been observed . </S>"
