    "the question of the origin of @xmath0 violation remains one of the outstanding puzzles in particle physics . although @xmath0 violation has now been seen in a number of processes in the kaon and @xmath6-meson systems  @xcite , it is still far from clear whether its explanation lies exclusively within the picture provided by the standard model  @xcite . to pin down the sources of @xmath0 violation , it is essential to observe it in many other processes .",
    "hyperon nonleptonic decays provide an environment where it is possible to make additional observations of @xmath0 violation  @xcite . currently , there are @xmath0-violation searches in such processes being conducted by the hypercp  ( e871 ) collaboration at fermilab .",

    "the hypercp experiment is sensitive to the _ sum _ of @xmath0 violation in the @xmath18 decay and @xmath0 violation in the @xmath19 decay , measuring  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the @xmath0-violating asymmetries in @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
