    "semileptonic @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) decays provide the most precise determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "presently , the dominant uncertainty in the experimentally determined quantity @xmath5 arises from the unknown shape of the hadronic form factor @xmath6 , as a function of momentum transfer @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the data can be fit to both simplified pole models and series expansions , but the uncertainty inherent in these simplifications is difficult to estimate , and the difference between the resulting @xmath5 determinations represents a systematic error . constraining this shape from first principles and providing rigorous error estimates is an important problem .",
    "the remaining ( and presently , dominant ) error in the @xmath4 determination of @xmath2 arises from the normalization , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 data ( specifically @xmath10 ) also constrain the shape of the scalar form factor , @xmath11 .",
    "this can potentially reduce dominant errors in the theory normalization , either by avoiding an extrapolation from zero recoil in lattice determinations  @xcite , or by fixing low - energy constants of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . at present , the comparison between theory and experiment , and between different experiments , is complicated by uncertainties in the form factor parameterization .",
    "again , extracting as much information as possible from the experimental data without model assumptions is an important task .",
    "this paper establishes rigorous bounds for the expansion coefficients appearing in a general parameterization of the semileptonic @xmath0 form factors .",
    "the framework for the analysis is based on familiar arguments invoking analyticity and crossing symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to conventional arguments appealing to unitarity and the evaluation of an operator product expansion ( ope ) , bounds for the vector form factor are derived directly from experimental data for hadronic tau decays , @xmath1 .",
    "the result is more stringent than can be obtained from the ope analysis , and applies to a more general class of parameterizations .",
    "+ _ analyticity and convergence . _",
    "form factors are defined as usual by the matrix element of the weak vector current @xmath12 : ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be extended to analytic functions throughout the complex @xmath18 plane , except along a branch cut on the positive real axis starting at @xmath19 production threshold @xmath20 [ @xmath21 .",

    "the function @xmath29 sums an infinite number of terms , transforming the original series , naively an expansion involving @xmath30 , into a series with a much smaller expansion parameter .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath31 minimizes the maximum value of @xmath32 occurring in the semileptonic region , and for this choice @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath27 and the number @xmath34 may be regarded as defining a `` scheme '' for the expansion .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath32 and coefficients @xmath35 are then `` scheme - dependent '' quantities , with the scheme dependence dropping out in physical observables such as @xmath36 .    neglecting terms beyond @xmath37 in ( [ eq : fexpand ] ) introduces a relative normalization error @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , the error on the relative slope involves terms of order @xmath39 . since @xmath40 and @xmath41 , simple power counting in @xmath32 yields strong constraints on the impact of higher - order terms in the expansion , provided that the coefficients @xmath42 are well - behaved .",
    "+ _ crossing symmetry and form factor bounds . _",
    "it is important in practice to determine whether large `` order unity '' coefficients @xmath42 could upset the formal power counting in @xmath32 . to address this question , a norm may be defined via @xmath43 by crossing symmetry , the norm can be evaluated using form factors for the related process of @xmath19 production .",

    "this error can also be robustly estimated by including higher order terms in fits to the experimental data , under the constraint ( [ eq : sbound ] ) .    to further constrain the slope",
    "requires either more precise semileptonic data , or independent constraints on the form factor .",
    "one type of constraint appeals to symmetry principles , in particular at the callan - treiman point where @xmath148 with a controllably small correction , @xmath149  @xcite .",

    "even supposing arbitrarily precise scattering data were available up to the inelastic threshold , @xmath151 , it is easy to see that dramatic constraints are not expected in the semileptonic region . since the additional data relates to the form factor at points along the cut in the @xmath18-plane , where @xmath152 , constraints from the scattering data can be satisfied by tuning higher - order coefficients @xmath35 in ( [ eq : fexpand ] ) , which have relatively minor impact in the semileptonic region .",
    "more quantitatively , with arbitrarily precise data , a suitable phase redefinition of the form factor ( a particular choice of @xmath27 ) can postpone the branch point in @xmath153 until @xmath154 . replacing @xmath155 with @xmath154 in ( [ eq : zdef ] )",
    ", we see that the maximum size of the effective expansion parameter can then be made as small as @xmath156 throughout the semileptonic region , compared to @xmath157 when the branch point appears at @xmath155 .",
    "thus while some improvement is possible by directly incorporating the experimental scattering data , more dramatic gains in precision require further dynamical inputs or assumptions  @xcite .",
    "the general parameterization ( [ eq : fexpand ] ) , with constraints ( [ eq : vbound ] ) and ( [ eq : sbound ] ) , can be used to systematically analyze the @xmath9 data without model assumptions .",
    "this should eliminate a dominant uncertainty in the experimental determination of @xmath5 , and allow for a more definitive comparison of shape observables measured by different experiments .",
    "@xmath4 decays provide a unique opportunity to investigate the convergence properties of the expansion ( [ eq : fexpand ] ) .",
    "precision data can be used to directly constrain the first few coefficients , and the existence of a heavy lepton , @xmath158 , makes it possible to establish bounds on the dominant vector form factor that are both more stringent and more generally applicable than those obtained from an ope analysis .",
