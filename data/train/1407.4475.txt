    "low luminosity gamma - ray bursts ( _ ll_grbs ) , or sub - energetic grbs , are a subsample of grbs that emit @xmath0  @xmath1 erg / s of gamma - rays or hard x - rays .",
    "this is several orders of magnitude below the typical luminosity of long grbs .",
    "additionally , these bursts are characterized by a single pulsed smooth light curve and by a very soft spectrum . even though _ ll_grbs are more numerous than typical long grbs @xcite , because of their low luminosity only a few of these _ ll_grbs have been discovered to date .",
    "these include grb 980425 @xcite , grb 031203 @xcite , grb 060218 @xcite and grb 100316d @xcite .",
    "_ ll_gbrs also have a radio afterglow , which indicates a comparable energy in mildly relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "this energy is only a small fraction of the total explosion energy in the supernovae ( @xmath2  @xmath3 erg ) that follow _ ll_grbs .",
    "several authors have suggested that _",
    "ll_grbs are produced by shock breakouts @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite have shown that _",
    "ll_grbs jets are not powerful enough to punch a hole in a stellar envelope and as such they can not be produced via the common collapsar model for long grbs . at the same time , by studying the emission from a relativistic shock breakout , @xcite have provided strong evidence that the `` prompt '' emission in _",
    "ll_grbs is produced by this mechanism .",
    "the breakout of a shock that travels outward through a stellar envelope produces the first observable light from a stellar explosion .",
    "as the shock crosses the stellar envelope , and as the envelope s density decreases outwards , the shock accelerates and it breaks out at a larger velocity than it had in the stellar interior , carrying , however , only a small fraction of the explosion energy . before the breakout , the shock is radiation - dominated . at the time of the breakout , all photons in the transition layer escape and produce a short and bright flash .",
    "newtonian shock breakout has been explored before by many authors @xcite .",
    "for relatively slow shocks , the radiation in the shock breakout layer is in thermal equilibrium and it produces a signal that peaks in the uv . for faster radiation - mediated shocks ,",
    "the radiation is not in thermal equilibrium @xcite , and it produces a signal that peaks in x - rays @xcite .",
    "the signal from a relativistic shock breakout has only been recently studied by @xcite , and it has been shown to produce a flash of soft gamma - rays .",
    "in particular , they found a `` relativistic breakout closure relation '' between the breakout energy , temperature and duration .",
    "remarkably , the observed 4 _ ll_grbs satisfy this relationship , strengthening their interpretation in the context of the relativistic shock breakout model .    following the relativistic shock breakout the envelope expands and accelerates in a way such that outer parts of the envelope are faster and less energetic , and inner parts are slower and more energetic .",
    "this ejecta interacts with the circumstellar medium and drives an external shock , which accelerates particles and generates synchrotron emission . as slower and more energetic material catches up with the decelerating ejecta it re - energizes the blast wave . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the expected synchrotron afterglow signal from the forward shock that arises from the interaction of these ejecta with the circum - burst material .",
    "we then compare the expected signal with the available multiwavelength _",
    "ll_grb afterglow data .",
    "this can serve as an additional test of the relativistic shock breakout model for the `` prompt '' signal in _ ll_grbs .",
    "the expected afterglow from a relativistic shock breakout is similar to the afterglow that arises from the long - lasting blast wave in regular grbs @xcite .",
    "the main difference arises from the fact that within the shock breakout the blast wave is continuously re - energized by slower ejecta .",
    "the relativistic shock breakout model provides the distribution of the kinetic energy of the ejecta as a function of its velocity ( or its lorentz factor ) . using this distribution and the `` refreshed shock model '' considered before in the context of grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we estimate the resulting dynamics of the blast wave and its emission .",
    "we note that the relativistic shock breakout scenario and the interaction of the ejecta with the external medium has been considered before by @xcite , and recently considered in the context of the breakout from neutron star mergers @xcite .",
    "however , in this work we consider it in the context of _",
    "ll_grbs , for which we have evidence suggesting that this mechanism takes place . moreover , for _",
    "ll_grbs we have available multiwavelength data that allow us to put this theory to the test .",
    "we also consider not only the relativistic phase , but also the non - relativistic phase , which is important in some _",
    "ll_grbs , where the shock breakout is mildly relativistic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ dynamics ] , we consider the dynamics of the relativistic shock breakout scenario .",
    "we calculate , in section [ afterglow_signal ] , the light curves and spectra expected as the ejected material following the breakout interacts with the external medium , both in the relativistic and the non - relativistic phases . in section [ application ] , we calculate the expected afterglow signal from _ ll_grbs using the general formalism presented in section [ afterglow_signal ] and compare it with the multiwavelength afterglow observations of _ ll_grbs . we discuss each _ ll_grb in section [ application ] .",
    "we examine the constraints on the x - ray emitting region in section [ xray_constraints_section ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results and our conclusions in section [ final_section ] .",
    "we begin summarizing the dynamics of the shock propagation within a stellar envelope before and after the breakout . before the breakout , a relativistic shock accelerates as @xmath4 where @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the pre - shock density and @xmath7 is the lorentz factor ( the subscript `` i '' stands for `` initial '' ) . we treat the whole expanding envelope as a series of successive shells . following the breakout ,",
    "these shells expand and accelerate to a final lorentz factor given by @xmath8 the density near the stellar edge is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the stellar radius and @xmath12 the distance from the star center , and @xmath13 the polytropic index .",
    "typically , for the stars in which shocks will be relativistic , @xmath14 .",
    "the mass of each of the shells at the edge is approximately given by @xmath15 .",
    "the energy of each shell after it has reached @xmath16 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the speed of light . using eq .",
    "( [ gamma_f ] ) , we can express @xmath19 as a function of @xmath16 and find @xmath20 as a function of @xmath16 as follows @xmath21 where we have used @xmath22 in the last expression .",
    "this expression is consistent with , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as each one of the shells interacts with the circumstellar medium , they will drive a forward and a reverse shock .",
    "particles will be accelerated in these shocks and radiation will be produced . in the scenario",
    "considered above , shells will continuously inject energy to the blast wave , since slower shells contain more energy than faster ones and they catch up with the decelerating ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy injection , in this scenario is typically characterized as @xmath23 .",
    "the results of the last section show that , for a relativistic breakout from a stellar envelope @xmath24 where we have used @xmath22 in the last expression .      at the time of breakout ,",
    "most of the energy is emitted by a shell with pre - explosion optical depth of order unity .",
    "we denote this shell as the _ breakout shell _ , and define its final lorentz factor as @xmath25 and its final energy as @xmath26 .",
    "subsequent shells will be more energetic but slower than the breakout shell .",
    "the final lorentz factor of the breakout shell is crucial in determining the total bolometric energy radiated from the breakout and the duration / temperature of the breakout emission .",
    "it allows for the derivation of a `` relativistic breakout closure relation '' @xcite .",
    "the optical depth of the breakout shell , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 @xmath29 g@xmath30 , implies that the mass of the breakout shell is @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the stellar radius in units of @xmath33 . using @xmath34 we find @xmath35",
    "therefore , we can normalize the proportionality relation eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) using @xmath26 and @xmath25 as @xmath36 in summary , by identifying the emission from the breakout and using the relativistic breakout relation , we can determine @xmath25 and the breakout stellar radius .",
    "with these two quantities , we can determine @xmath26 using eq .",

    "the slower / more energetic shells will catch up with the faster / less energetic ones when the latter have decelerated to a comparable lorentz factor . at this point , the lorentz factor of the shocked material is @xcite : @xmath51 and the blast wave energy increases as @xmath52 where time @xmath53 is the observer s time since breakout .",
    "thus , due to the energy injection of slower / more energetic shells , the blast wave lf decrease with time slower compared with the case when no energy injection proceeds ( @xmath54 ) . for the case considered here , @xmath55 , the lf decreases as @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) for ism ( wind ) medium .",

    "( [ gamma_f_vs_time ] ) : @xmath62 afterward , the energy injection of non - relativistic shells will be important .",
    "we note that acceleration continues beyond the breakout shell , up to the outermost shell , as long as the temperature in the shock exceeds @xmath63 kev , which is required for the creation of a significant amount of pairs ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "that is , although the breakout shell carries most of the energy during the breakout event , it is preceded by shells with lower energy  as prescribed by eq .",
    "( [ e_vs_gamma ] )  but that move faster .",
    "a conservative lower limit of the _ final _ lorentz factor of the outermost shell is given by @xcite @xmath64 this faster material will decelerate earlier than @xmath65 , since the deceleration time depends much stronger on the lorentz factor than on the energy ( see eq .",

    " increases as @xmath68 , see eq .",

    "we note that the energy injection in the non - relativistic phase will proceed until a characteristic velocity of the order of @xmath84 is reached , where @xmath20 and @xmath85 are the total explosion energy and the total ejected mass , respectively .",

    "our solution for this grb has @xmath171 , however , the two models are inherently different .",
    "@xcite allow for the energy of the blast wave to increase _ instantaneously _ by a factor of @xmath172 to explain the increase by a factor of @xmath173 in the radio light curves at @xmath149 days .",

    "the lorentz factor of the breakout shell for this burst is close to unity and creation of pairs in the shock is marginal .",
    "therefore , it is likely that no shells are accelerated to velocities faster than the breakout shell , in which case the forward shock is coasting at a constant velocity for a long time until the breakout shell decelerates . in this case",
    "only a wind medium can fit the observed decaying radio afterglow and this is the model we consider here .",

    "radio and x - ray afterglow observations of grb 060218 have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the radio light curve at 8.46 ghz decays as @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "we find that this radio band is between @xmath92 and @xmath94 ( @xmath93 is below @xmath92 ) .",
    "( [ f_nu_coasting ] ) , we find that a value of @xmath177 fits the decay of the radio observations , and this is the reason we present the light curves for this value of @xmath89 in fig .",

    "with that model the predicted x - ray emission is below the observed value by at least a factor of @xmath143 .    as in the case of grb 980425 , we lower the value of @xmath89 to obtain a rough estimate if a concave electron spectrum may fit the radio and x - ray data simultaneously .",
    "this increases the predicted x - ray flux , although , it makes the light curve shallower , see eq . ( [ f_nu_coasting ] ) , which is inconsistent with the observed decay @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy between the predicted and observed x - ray flux shrinks with a smaller value of @xmath89 .",
    "even if such a modification would be capable of explaining the x - ray flux , the predicted x - ray spectrum is @xmath180 .",
    "this stands in contrast with the observed x - ray spectrum @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "such a steep spectrum can not be explained within this model , unless the electron spectrum has a cut - off at energies of the x - ray emitting electrons .",
    "this solution is contrived , and we conclude that the x - ray and the radio are most likely of different origin .    if faster shells than the breakout shell are present , then the blast wave would start decelerating at much earlier times and it can be relativistic for long enough for the decreasing radio emission to be consistent also with a constant density medium .",
    "however , in that case @xmath182 ghz @xmath183 at 5 days , which leads to a flux at 1.43 ghz that is at least a factor of @xmath184 brighter than the upper limit at that time .",
    "this is marginal even if there is strong scintillation , but can not be completely ruled out . the x - ray emission in that case is still underpredicted by the model if a single electron power - law is assumed and the difficulty to reproduce the x - ray spectrum persists .",
    "the last burst in our sample is grb 100316d , whose x - ray data are presented in @xcite , and additional x - ray data and the radio data are presented in @xcite .",
    "since this burst is almost identical to grb 060218 , and it is explained with the same parameters within the relativistic shock breakout model , we use the same afterglow model , namely synchrotron emission from a coasting blast wave in a wind medium .",
    "the radio data of this burst are sparse , available only in two frequencies and possibly affected by scintillation .",
    "therefore , it is not very constraining and many models can fit the radio data . here",
    "we present one such model in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which fits the radio data reasonably well .",
    "most importantly , @xmath92 is not well constrained , e.g. , @xcite suggest that @xmath185 ghz at @xmath149 days , whereas in the model presented here this value of @xmath92 is obtained at @xmath136 days . as a result",
    "the radius and thus the velocity of the radio emitting region can significantly vary between various acceptable models .",
    "the model underpredicts x - ray flux compared with the observed value by a factor of more than @xmath186 . as for grb 060218 , a smaller value of @xmath89 ( concave electron spectrum ) increases the predicted x - ray flux , but the x - ray light curve is too shallow and it is inconsistent with the observed decay @xmath187 @xcite . at the same time the observed x - ray spectrum , @xmath188 @xcite , is similar to that of grb 060218 and it indicates that also here the x - ray and the radio are most likely generated by different processes .",
    "the blast wave moves with a constant velocity and its energy increases linearly with time until it reaches @xmath175 erg at the deceleration time of @xmath189 d. we note that solutions with a smaller density also fit the data well ( and also underestimate the x - ray fluxes ) and the deceleration phase might be delayed for an even longer time . if faster shells than the breakout shell would be present , then an ism or wind medium would also marginally fit the radio data , since the data are not very constraining .",
    "@xcite have modeled the radio emission of grb 060218 , and @xcite the one of grb 100316d in the context of the external forward shock emission .",
    "the external densities they find are different than ours .",
    "however , here the afterglow is produced in the coasting phase , whereas they considered a decelerating blast wave .",
    "the x - ray afterglows in grb 060218 and grb 100316d are most likely not generated by the same process that produces their radio emission .",
    "nevertheless , several strong constraints on the x - ray source can be derived from simple considerations .",
    "these constraints are regardless of whether _ ll_grbs are shock breakouts or not , or even of the exact models of both the radio and the x - ray emission . in both bursts",
    "the total energy emitted in x - rays by @xmath190 s is @xmath191 erg ( assuming isotropy ; see below ) .",
    "thus , the first general constraint is that for any reasonable radiative efficiency , the source energy at that time is @xmath192 erg , and most likely significantly higher .",
    "the x - ray energy output is roughly constant for every logarithmic time interval , implying that the energy constraint at @xmath193 s is lower by about an order of magnitude .",
    "a second constraint follows from the fact that the gamma - ray emission , which led to the bursts detection , is not highly collimated , namely opening angle @xmath194 and inverse beaming factor @xmath195 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "given that the x - ray emission is seen in both bursts , it is most likely not highly collimated as well .",
    "this implies that the source can not be a highly relativistic narrow jet .",
    "in fact , the radio emission implies that the x - ray source can not be highly relativistic even if it is not narrowly collimated .",
    "the reason is that without being collimated it can not run ahead of the radio source , otherwise it will sweep the circum - burst medium , thereby preventing the interaction that leads to the radio emission .",
    "now , the radio source , at least in grb 060218 where @xmath92 is measured , is mildly relativistic .",
    "@xcite measures @xmath196 ghz and @xmath197 mjy at 5 days for grb 060218 .",
    "using @xcite we find that if we require that the energy in the radio emitting region is @xmath198 and we allow for a ( large ) uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath92 by a factor of @xmath173 , then these observations imply a lorentz factor of the radio emitting region @xmath199 at 5 days . ] .",
    "therefore , the x - ray source is at most mildly relativistic , implying that the x - ray emission radius , @xmath200 , is limited to @xmath201 .    on the other , hand the x - ray emitting radius can not be too low .",
    "the line profiles of sn 2006aj ( the sn that accompanied grb 060218 ) do not show signs of anisotropy , and there is no polarization ( @xmath199 per cent at the 3-@xmath202 level ) either in the lines nor in the continuum , implying that the bulk of the sn ejecta has no strong deviation from spherical symmetry @xcite . this ejecta is about a solar mass moving at a velocity @xmath203c @xcite that lies between the observer and the center of the explosion .",
    "no radiation that is emitted behind this mass can escape to the observer on a time - scale that is shorter than about a week ( since the diffusion time is too long ) .",
    "therefore , the x - ray source must be at all time _ ahead of _ the bulk of the sn mass .",
    "thus , together with the limit that the radio emitting region is ahead of the x - ray source , we obtain @xmath204 .",
    "given that the afterglow is observed over two decades in time , the radius of the region where x - rays are generated must increase in time together with the sn ejecta .",
    "this constraint implies that the x - ray source is most likely within the explosion ejecta , between the bulk of the sn mass ( the slowest part of the ejecta ) and the leading radio source ( the fastest part of the ejecta ) .",
    "this disfavors emission models that are powered by internal dissipation in an unrelated component , such as internal shocks or magnetic reconnection in an outflow that is unrelated to the one producing the sn and the radio emission .",
    "the constraints derived above are non - trivial and can not be easily met by most types of x - ray sources . specifically , they are most difficult to reconcile with any source that gains its energy continuously from a central engine , as has often been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main problem in such sources is that the energy which is generated in the center must penetrate through several solar masses of sn ejecta , while the source is not relativistic and it is not narrowly collimated ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "furthermore , this should take place without the energy being dissipated below the photosphere and without leaving any major imprint on the asymmetry inferred from the sn line profiles .",
    "we note that a simple `` inward '' extrapolation in energy ( from the energy of the fast moving material to the sn energy ) described at the end of section [ nr phase ] does not work .",
    "namely , the energy - velocity relation is too shallow compared to that seen in regular sne and to that expected in a simple spherical blast wave that propagates in a typical star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is true even when one accounts for the shallow relativistic slope described here and in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this probably implies that the explosion is not fully spherical ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or that the stellar structure is different than in typical sne , or a combination of the two .",
    "a likely explanation for this point is discussed in a future work ( nakar , in preparation ) .",
    "regardless of the reason for the shallow energy profile , the observations indicate that the asphericity , if exists , is not high ( inverse beaming factor @xmath195 ) and that the spherical approximation for the gamma - ray emission and the following blast wave is reasonable .",
    "note that if the breakout deviates from spherical symmetry this may result in breakout velocities that are slower in some parts of the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "but , unless the breakout asphericity is high , the breakout from most of the stellar surface will not be strongly affected ; neither the resulting gamma - rays nor the following blast wave .",
    "we have calculated the synchrotron emission from the forward shock that arises during the interaction between the stellar ejecta and the circum - burst medium following a relativistic shock breakout .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the shock breakout ejecta is described following @xcite , where we assumed that the progenitor has a standard radiative stellar envelope , characterized by a polytropic index @xmath22 .",
    "for the subsequent blast wave evolution we assume that the circum - burst density profile is either constant ( ism ) or @xmath205 ( wind ) .",
    "the main difference between this model and the standard grb afterglow model is that here energy is continuously injected into the slowly decelerating blast wave by slower ejecta whose profile is dictated by the sn shock that unbinds the stellar envelope .",
    "once the behavior of the blast wave is determined the emission follows the standard grb synchrotron afterglow model @xcite .",
    "we have applied this model to the four _ ll_grbs with good data , grbs 980425 , 031203 , 060218 and 100316d .",
    "the prompt emission provides us the initial conditions ( the energy and lorentz factor profiles ) of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "we first fit , for each burst , the free parameters of the emission model to the observed radio afterglow and then check if the same model parameters can also explain the observed x - ray afterglow .",
    "we find that the model can successfully explain the radio emission of all four _ ll_grbs . in some _",
    "ll_grbs , the x - ray emission can also be generated by the same population of electrons that generate the radio emission , while in others it can not .    for grb 031203 , we find that the simplest model can successfully fit _ both _ the observed radio and x - ray afterglows light curves and spectra with a single set of parameters , if the external medium is an ism .",
    "this burst is the only _",
    "ll_grb for which we expect the blast wave producing the afterglow to be relativistic , similarly to regular grbs , and indeed the parameters we find for the external density and microphysical parameters are similar to those found in regular grbs .",
    "this is the first time that _ both _ the prompt and the afterglow emission can be explained for a single _ ll_grb : the prompt emission is produced by the relativistic shock breakout signal and the radio and x - ray afterglow are explained by its accompanying external shock",
    ".    for grb 980425 , a model with a wind medium fits the radio data .",
    "the density of the wind is such that the blast wave is already newtonian at the time of the first observation . using the simplest model , the same parameters that fit the radio data result in an x - ray spectrum that is too soft and an x - ray flux that is too low .",
    "however , the model can simultaneously explain the radio and x - ray observations ( both the light curve and the spectrum ) with a minor modification that relaxes the assumption of a single power - law electron distribution . a concave electron distribution with a logarithmic derivative of @xmath206 for the radio emitting electrons and @xmath207 for the x - ray emitting electrons can fit both observations .",
    "interestingly such a spectrum is predicted by some _ fermi _ acceleration models in newtonian shocks , due to nonlinear feedback of the accelerated particles on the shock structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for grb 060218 and 100316d ,",
    "the relativistic shock breakout model predicts a mildly relativistic breakout that is consistent with the absence of ejecta faster than the breakout shell . in that case",
    "the breakout shell decelerates after a long time , and the observed afterglow is produced via synchrotron emission in the coasting phase .",
    "the observed radio afterglow , which decays at late times , is consistent only with a wind medium ( in the ism case all light curves rise during the coasting phase ) .",
    "this model is able to fit the radio data .",
    "however , with the same parameters , it underestimates the x - ray flux .",
    "moreover , the afterglow x - ray spectra in these two bursts are very steep . in fact",
    ", it is very peculiar compared to other grb afterglows .",
    "yet , the light curve in both cases ( a very bright simple power - law , roughly @xmath208 ) resembles that of regular grbs and is uncommon in ordinary sne .",
    "the steep spectra implies , first , that it is highly unlikely that the x - rays and the radio are generated by the same population of electrons , as was already found earlier @xcite .",
    "secondly , the combination of the x - ray spectra and light curves in these two bursts , suggests that the x - ray source is uncommon to either regular grbs or regular sne .",
    "we stress that while we have found models that are consistent with the radio emission of all four _ ll_grbs , these are by no means the only consistent models .",
    "first , within the synchrotron forward shock model there is enough freedom to allow for a range of parameters that fit the observations .",
    "secondly , we did not attempt to calculate here the synchrotron emission from the reverse shock or the contribution of inverse compton emission from either the forward or the reverse shocks .",
    "it is most likely that there are solutions where the observed radio emission is dominated by one of these components ( e.g. , reverse shock synchrotron ) .",
    "the main puzzle that remains is the source of the x - ray afterglow in _",
    "ll_grbs 060218 and 100316d .",
    "we draw here some general constraints on the source of this emission , finding that it is not narrowly collimated and that it is not ultra - relativistic .",
    "the source itself is most likely moving at velocity @xmath209c and a lorentz factor @xmath199 , and it is located at all time somewhere within the ejecta , between the bulk of the sn mass and the leading radio source .",
    "previous authors invoked the existence of a continuous central engine to explain the x - ray afterglow @xcite , without discussing how such a source produces this emission .",
    "the constraints we derive here show that long lasting central engine activity is unlikely to be the correct solution .",
    "the major difficulty for this model is the need for the central engine energy , that is not narrowly collimated , to penetrate through the opaque sn ejecta without leaving a trace of anisotropy in the spectral line profiles @xcite .",
    "additionally , the combination of the x - ray light curve and spectrum seen in these bursts is unique and does not resemble any other cases where we have a good reason to suspect that they are a result of central engine activity . in our view , given that the x - ray source is probably moving together with the ejecta , the most natural scenario is that the x - ray source is within the interaction layer that is also responsible for the radio emission .",
    "since the x - ray and the radio do not arise from the same process , it is possible that either the long lived reverse shock ( within a refreshed shocks scenario ) or inverse compton emission can explain these unique x - ray signatures .",
