    "subscriber trajectory datasets collected by network operators are logs of timestamped , georeferenced events associated to the communication activities of individuals .",
    "the analysis of these datasets allows inferring _ fine - grained _ information about the movements , habits and undertakings of vast user populations .",
    "this has many different applications , encompassing both business and research .",
    "for instance , trajectory data can be used to devise novel data - driven network optimization techniques  @xcite or support content delivery operations at the network edge  @xcite .",
    "they can also be monetized via added - value services such as transport analytics  @xcite or location - based marketing  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the relevance of massive movement data from mobile subscribers is critical in research disciplines such as physics , sociology or epidemiology  @xcite .",
    "the importance of trajectory data has also been recognized in the design of future 5 g networks , with a thrust towards the introduction of data interfaces among network operators and over - the - top ( ott ) providers to give them online access to this ( and other ) data .",
    "otts can leverage such interfaces to automatically retrieve the data and process them on the fly , thus enabling new applications such as intelligent transportation  @xcite or assisted - life services  @xcite .",
    "all these use cases stem from the disclosure of trajectory datasets to third parties . however , the open release of such data is still largely withhold , which hinders potential usages and applications .",
    "a major barrier in this sense are privacy concerns : data circulation exposes it to re - identification attacks , and cognition of the movement patterns of de - anonymized individuals may reveal sensitive information about them .",
    "this calls for anonymization techniques .",
    "the common practice operators adhere to is replacing personal identifiers ( e.g. , name , phone number , imsi ) with pseudo - identifiers ( i.e. , random or non - reversible hash values ) . whether this is a sufficient measure",
    "is often called into question , especially in relation to the possibility of tracking user movements .",
    "what is sure is that pseudo - identifiers have been repeatedly proven not to protect against user trajectory uniqueness , i.e. , the fact that mobile subscribers have distinctive travel patterns that make them univocally recognizable even in very large populations  @xcite .",
    "uniqueness is not a privacy threat per - se , but it is a vulnerability that can lead to re - identification .",
    "examples are brought forth by recent attempts at cross - correlating mobile operator - collected trajectories with georeferenced check - ins of flickr and twitter users  @xcite , with credit card records  @xcite or with yelp , google places and facebook metadata  @xcite .",
    "more dependable anonymization solutions are needed .",
    "however , the strategies devised to date for relational databases , location - based services , or regularly sampled ( e.g. , gps ) mobility do not suit the irregular sampling , time sparsity , and long duration of trajectories collected by mobile operators .",
    "moreover , current privacy criteria , including @xmath1-anonymity and differential privacy , do not provide sufficient protection or are impractical in this context .",
    "see sec.[sec : related ] for a detailed discussion .    in this paper , we put forward several contributions towards _ privacy - preserving data publishing ( ppdp ) _ of mobile subscriber trajectories .",
    "our contributions are as follows : _",
    "we outline attacks that are especially relevant to datasets of spatiotemporal trajectories ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "we introduce @xmath0-anonymity , a novel privacy criterion that effectively copes with the most threatening attacks above ; _ ( iii ) _  we develop ` k - merge ` , an algorithm that solves a fundamental problem in the anonymization of spatiotemporal trajectories , i.e. , effective generalization ; _ ( iv ) _",
    "we implement ` kte - hide ` , a practical solution based on ` k - merge`that attains @xmath0-anonymityin spatiotemporal trajectory data ; _ ( v ) _",
    "we evaluate our approach on real - world datasets , showing that it achieves its objectives while retaining a substantial level of accuracy in the anonymized data .",
    "we first present the requirements of ppdp , in sec.[sub : ppdp ] , and formalize the specific attacker model we consider , in sec.[sub : att ] .",
    "we then propose a consistent privacy model , in sec.[sub : priv ] .",
    "ppdp is defined as the development of methods for the publication of information that allows meaningful knowledge discovery , and yet preserves the privacy of monitored subjects  @xcite .",
    "the requisites of ppdp are similar for all types of databases , including our specific case , i.e. , datasets of spatiotemporal trajectories .",
    "they are as follows .    * _ the non - expert data publisher .",
    "_ mining of the data is performed by the data recipient , and not by the data publisher .",
    "the only task of the data publisher is to anonymize the data for publication . * _ publication of data , and not of data mining results_. the aim of ppdp is producing privacy - preserving datasets , and not anonymized datasets of classifiers , association rules , or aggregate statistics .",
    "this sets ppdp apart from privacy - preserving data mining ( ppdm ) , where the final usage of the data is known at dataset compilation time .",
    "* _ truthfulness at the record level_. each record of the published database must correspond to a real - world subject .",
    "moreover , all information on a subject must map to actual activities or features of the subject .",
    "this avoids that fictitious data introduces unpredictable biases in the anonymized datasets .",
    "our privacy model will obey the principles above .",
    "we stress that they impose that the privacy model must be agnostic of data usage ( points 1 and 2 ) , and that it can not rely on randomized , perturbed , permuted and synthetic data ( point 3 ) .      unlike ppdp requirements , the attacker model is necessarily specific to the type of data we consider , and it is characterized by the _ knowledge _ and _ goal _ of the adversary .",
    "the former describes the information the opponent possesses , while the latter represents his privacy - threatening objective .      in trajectory datasets ,",
    "each data record is a sequence of spatiotemporal samples .",
    "we assume an attacker who can track a target subscriber continuously during any amount of time @xmath2 .",
    "the adversary knowledge consists then in all spatiotemporal samples in the victim s trajectory over a continuous that covers all disjoint tracking intervals . ]",
    "time interval of duration @xmath2 .",
    "attacks against user privacy in published data can have different objectives , and a comprehensive classification is provided in  @xcite .",
    "two classes of attacks are especially relevant in the context of mobile subscriber trajectory data .",
    "both exploit the uniqueness of movement patterns that , as mentioned in sec.[sec : intro ] , characterizes trajectory data .    * _ record linkage attacks .",
    "_ these attacks aim at univocally distinguishing an individual in the database .",
    "a successful record linkage enables cross - database correlation , which may ultimately unveil the identity of the user .",
    "record linkage attacks on mobile traffic data have been repeatedly and successfully demonstrated  @xcite . as mentioned in sec.[sec : intro ] , they have also been used for subsequent cross - database correlations  @xcite . * _ probabilistic attacks . _",
    "these attacks let an adversary with partial information about an individual enlarge his knowledge on that individual by accessing the database .",
    "they are especially relevant to spatiotemporal trajectories , as shown by seminal works that first unveiled the anonymization issues of mobile traffic datasets  @xcite .",
    "let us imagine a scenario where an adversary knows a small set of spatiotemporal points in the trajectory of a subscriber ( because , e.g. , he met the target individual there ) .",
    "a successful probabilistic attack would reveal the complete movements of the subscriber to the attacker , who could then use them to infer sensitive information about the victim , such as home / work locations , daily routines , or visits to healthcare structures .",
    "our privacy model will address both classes of attacks above , led by an adversary with knowledge described in sec.[sub : knowledge ] .",
    "our privacy model is designed following the ppdp requirements and attacker model presented before .",
    "we start by considering suitable privacy criteria against record linkage and probabilistic attacks , in sec.[sub : ka ] and sec.[sub : uninf ] , respectively .",
    "we then show how the first criterion is in fact a specialization of the second , in sec.[sub : relate ] , which allows us to focus on a single unifying privacy model . finally , we present the elementary techniques that we employ to implement the target privacy criterion , in sec.[sub : tools ] .",
    "the _ @xmath1-anonymity _",
    "criterion realizes the _ indistinguishability principle _ , by commending that each record in a database must be indistinguishable from at least @xmath3 other records in the same database  @xcite . in our case , this maps to ensuring that each subscriber is hidden in a crowd of @xmath1 users whose trajectories can not be told apart .",
    "the popularity of @xmath1-anonymity for ppdp has led to indiscriminated use beyond its scope , and subsequent controversy on the privacy guarantees it can provide .",
    "e.g. , @xmath1-anonymity has been proven ineffective againt attacks aiming at attribute linkage ( including exploits of insufficient side - information diversity ) , at localizing users , or at disclosing their presence and meetings  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath1-anonymity remains a legitimate criterion against record linkage attacks on any kind of database  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this privacy model protects trajectory data from the first type of attack in sec.[sub : att ] , including its variations in  @xcite .      no privacy criterion proposed",
    "to date can safeguard spatiotemporal trajectory data from the second type of attacks in sec.[sub : att ] , i.e. , probabilistic attacks .",
    "this forces us to define an original criterion , as follows .",
    "the pertinent principle here is the so - called _ uninformative principle _ ,",
    "i.e. , ensuring that the difference between the knowledge of the adversary before and after accessing a database is small  @xcite . in our context",
    ", this principle warrants that an attacker who knows some subset of a subscriber s movements can not extract from the dataset a substantially longer portion of that user s trajectory .    -anonymityof user @xmath4 , with @xmath1=2 . ]",
    "to attain the uninformative principle , we introduce the _ @xmath0-anonymity _ privacy criterion .",
    "@xmath0-anonymitycan be seen as a variation of _",
    "@xmath5-anonymity _ , which establishes that each individual in a dataset must be indistinguishable from at least @xmath3 other users in the same dataset , when limiting the attacker knowledge to any set of @xmath6 attributes  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-anonymity tailors @xmath5-anonymity to our scenario , as follows .    * as per sec.[sub : att ] , the attacker knowledge can be any continued sequence of spatiotemporal samples covering a time interval of length at most @xmath2 : thus , the @xmath6 parameter of @xmath5-anonymity maps to the ( variable ) set of samples contained in any time period @xmath2 . during any such time period , every trajectory in the dataset must be indistinguishable from at least other @xmath3 trajectories .",
    "* the maximum additional knowledge that the attacker is allowed to learn is called _ leakage _ ; it consists of the spatiotemporal samples of the target user s trajectory contained in a time interval of duration at most @xmath7 , disjoint from the original @xmath2 . in order to fulfill the uninformative principle",
    ", the leakage @xmath7 must be small .",
    "the two requirements above imply alternating in time the @xmath3 trajectories that provide anonymization .",
    "an intuitive example is provided in fig.[fig : km ] . there , the trajectory of a target user @xmath4 is @xmath8-anonymized using those of five other subscribers .",
    "the overlapping between the trajectories of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and that of @xmath4 is partial and varied .",
    "an adversary knowing a sub - trajectory of @xmath4 during any time interval of duration @xmath2 always finds at least one other user with a movement pattern that is identical to that of @xmath4 during that interval , but different elsewhere . with this knowledge ,",
    "the adversary can not tell apart @xmath4 from the other subscriber , and thus can not attribute full trajectories to one user or the other .",
    "as this holds no matter where the knowledge interval is shifted to , the attacker can never retrieve the complete movement patterns of @xmath4 : this achieves the uninformative principle .",
    "still , the adversary can increase its knowledge in some cases .",
    "let us consider the interval @xmath2 indicated in the figure : the trajectories of @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are identical for some time after @xmath2 , which allows associating to @xmath4 the movements during @xmath7 : the opponent learns one additional spatiotemporal sample of @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath1-anonymity is a special case of @xmath0-anonymity . as a matter of fact",
    ", the latter criterion reduces to the former when @xmath14 covers the whole temporal duration of the trajectory dataset .",
    "then , @xmath0-anonymitycommends that each complete trajectory is indistinguishable from @xmath3 other trajectories , which is the definition of @xmath1-anonymity .",
    "our point here is that an anonymization solution that implements @xmath0-anonymitycan be straightforwardly employed to attain @xmath1-anonymity as well , by properly adjusting the @xmath2 and @xmath7 parameters .    in the light of these considerations ,",
    "we address the problem of achieving @xmath0-anonymityin datasets of spatiotemporal trajectories of mobile subscribers . by doing so",
    ", we develop a complete anonymization solution that is effective against probabilistic attacks , but can also be specialized to guarantee @xmath1-anonymity and counter record linkage attacks .      in order to enforce @xmath0-anonymityfor all users in the dataset",
    ", we need to tweak the spatiotemporal samples in the trajectories of individuals , so that the criterion in sec.[sub : uninf ] is respected for all of them . to that end , we rely on two elementary techniques , i.e. , _ spatiotemporal generalization _ and _ suppression _ of samples .",
    "spatiotemporal generalization reduces the precision of trajectory samples in space and time , so as to make the samples of two or more users indistinguishable .",
    "suppression removes from the trajectories those samples that are too hard to anonymize .",
    "both techniques are lossy , i.e. , imply some reduction of precision in the data . yet , unlike other approaches , these techniques conform to the ppdp requirement of truthfulness at the record level , see sec.[sub : ppdp ] .",
    "our goal is ensuring that an anonymized dataset of mobile subscriber trajectories respects the uninformative principle , by implementing , through generalization and suppression , the @xmath0-anonymityof all subscriber trajectories in the dataset . clearly , we aim at doing so while minimizing the loss of spatiotemporal granularity in the data .",
    "we start by defining the basic operation of generalizing a set of spatiotemporal samples , and the associated cost in terms of loss of granularity , in sec.[sub : gen - samp ] .",
    "we then extend both notions to ( sub-)trajectories , in sec.[sub : gen - traj ] . building on these definitions ,",
    "we discuss in sec.[sub : kanon ] the optimal spatiotemporal generalization of @xmath1 ( sub-)trajectories .",
    "we implement the result into ` k - merge ` , an optimal low - complexity algorithm that generalizes ( sub-)trajectories with minimal loss of data granularity , in sec.[sub : kanon - impl ] . once able to merge ( sub-)trajectories optimally , we propose an approach to guarantee @xmath0-anonymityof the trajectory of a single user , in sec.[sub : kte - one ] , and we then scale the solution to multiple users in sec.[sub : kte - mul ] . finally , we introduce ` kte - hide ` , an algorithm that ensures @xmath0-anonymityin spatiotemporal trajectory datasets , in sec.[sub : algo ] .     and @xmath15 into a generalized trajectory @xmath16 . for clarity",
    ", space is unidimensional . ]",
    "a ( raw ) _ sample _ of a spatiotemporal trajectory represents the position of a subscriber at a given time , and we model it with a length-3 real vector @xmath17 . since a dataset is characterized by a finite granularity in time and space , a sample is in fact a slot spanning some minimum temporal and spatial intervals .",
    "the vector entries above can be regarded as the origins of a normalized length-1 time interval and a normalized 1@xmath181 two - dimensional area100 m@xmath19 area ) in space .",
    "however , our discussion is general , and holds for any precision in the data . ] .",
    "spatiotemporal generalization merges together two or more raw samples into a _ generalized sample _ ,",
    "i.e. , a slot with a larger span .",
    "mathematically , a generalized sample @xmath20 can be represented as the set of the merged samples .",
    "there is a cost associated with merging samples , which is related to the span of the corresponding generalized sample , i.e. , to the loss of granularity induced by the generalization .",
    "the cost of the operation of merging a set of samples into the generalized sample @xmath20 is defined as [ eq : sample_cost ] c ( g ) = c_t(g ) c_s ( g ) , where @xmath21 represents the cost in the time dimension , while @xmath22 is the cost in the space dimensions .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be two disjoint generalized samples ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "then , we make the following two assumptions on the time and space merging costs : [ eq : time_cost_prop ] c_t(g_1 g_2 ) c_t(g_1 ) + c_t ( g_2 ) [ eq : space_cost_prop ] c_s(g_1 g_2 )",
    "\\{c_s(g_1 ) , c_s ( g_2 ) } .",
    "hereafter , we use the following definitions to implement the generic costs @xmath21 and @xmath22 : [ eq : time_cost_def ] c_t(g ) = t(g ) [ eq : space_cost_def ] c_s(g ) = x(g ) + y(g ) , where [ eq : sample_star ] ( g ) = _ * s*g ( * s * ) - _ * s*g ( * s * ) + 1 , with @xmath26 , is the span in each dimension .",
    "therefore , in our implementation , @xmath27 is the area of a rectangle with sides @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a graphical example is provided in fig.[fig : gen ] , where two raw samples @xmath30 and @xmath31 are merged into a generalized sample @xmath23 , spanning @xmath32 in time and @xmath33 in space ( portrayed as unidimensional in the figure , for the sake of readability ) .",
    "the rationale for our choice of costs is computational efficiency . also , summing the two space spans before multiplication allows balancing the time and space contributions . finally , note that with the definition in",
    ", the space merging cost assumption in is trivially true .",
    "instead , the definition in lets the time merging cost assumption in hold only if the time intervals spanned by @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - overlapping .",
    "the time coherence property that we will introduce in sec.[sub : gen - traj ] ensures that this is the always case .",
    "a spatiotemporal ( sub-)trajectory describes the movements of a single subscriber during the dataset timespan . formally , a _ trajectory _ is an ordered vector of samples @xmath34 , where the ordering is induced by the time coordinate , i.e. , @xmath35",
    "if and only if @xmath36 .    a _ generalized trajectory _ , obtained by merging different trajectories , is defined as an ordered vector of generalized samples @xmath37 . here the ordering is more subtle , and based on the fact that the time intervals spanned by the generalized samples are non - overlapping , a property that will be called _",
    "time coherence_. more precisely , if @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath36 , are two generalized samples of @xmath40 , then @xmath41    an example of a generalized trajectory @xmath40 merging two trajectories @xmath42 and @xmath43 is provided in fig.[fig : gen ] .",
    "@xmath40 fulfils time coherence , as its generalized samples are temporally disjoint .",
    "time coherence is a defining property of generalized trajectories in ppdp . as a matter of fact ,",
    "publishing trajectory data with time - overlapping samples would generate semantic ambiguity and make analyses cumbersome .",
    "analogously to the cost of merging samples , we can define a cost of merging multiple trajectories into a generalized trajectory .",
    "we define such cost as the sum of costs of all generalized samples belonging to it . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is defined as in  , then the cost of @xmath40 is given by : [ eq : traj_cost ] c ( * g * ) = _ i=1^z c ( g_i ) .",
    "the cost in   is the overall surface covered by samples of the generalized trajectory over the spatiotemporal plane .",
    "e.g. , in fig.[fig : gen ] , the cost of @xmath40 is the sum of the three areas , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "it is thus proportional to the total loss of granularity induced by the generalization .",
    "we now formalize the problem of _ optimal _ generalization of spatiotemporal ( sub-)trajectories . suppose that we have @xmath1 trajectories @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the goal is a generalized trajectory @xmath50 from @xmath47 , which satisfies the following conditions .    _",

    ": gen ] , the generalized trajectory @xmath40 fulfils all these requirements , and is thus the optimal merge @xmath51 of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "solving the problem above with a brute - force search is computationally prohibitive , since @xmath56 has a size that grows exponentially with @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes cardinality .",
    "however , we can characterize @xmath51 so that it is possible to compute it with low complexity . to that end",
    ", we name _ elementary _ a partition @xmath60 that can not be refined to another partition within @xmath56 . in other words ,",
    "none of the generalized samples of an elementary partition can be split into two generalized samples without violating conditions i ) and ii ) above , or time coherence . then",

    "the structure of overlapping hiding sets is to be implemented so that the loss of accuracy in the @xmath0-anonymizedtrajectory is minimized .",

    "reuse constraint . _",
    "the uninformative principle requires alternating the @xmath3 trajectories used in different hiding sets , as per sec.[sub : uninf ] . a simple way to enforce",

    "_ as evidenced by the example in fig.[fig : kte - one - gen ] , the configuration of hiding sets changes at every epoch , and @xmath117 hiding sets overlap during each epoch .",

    "we compare our results against those obtained by the only three approaches proposed in the literature for the @xmath1-anonymization of trajectories along both spatial and temporal dimensions .",
    "the first is static generalization  @xcite , which consists in a homogeneous reduction of data granularity , decided arbitrarily and imposed on all user trajectories .",

    "it allows the creation of new synthetic samples , and it is thus not fully compliant with ppdp principles in sec.[sub : ppdp ] .",
    "the latter operation is leveraged to improve the matching among trajectories in a cluster , and assumes that mobile objects ( i.e. , subscribers in our case ) effectuate linear constant - speed movements between spatiotemporal samples .",
    "we use w4 m with linear spatiotemporal distance ( w4m - l ) , i.e. , the version intended for large databases such as those we consider , and configure it with the settings suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the third approach is glove  @xcite , which relies on a heuristic measure of anonymizability to assess the similarity of spatiotemporal trajectories .",
    "this measure is fed to a greedy algorithm to achieve @xmath1-anonymity with limited loss of granularity and without introducing fictitious data . however , unlike ` k - merge ` , glove does not provide an optimal solution , and is computationally expensive .",

    "similar results were obtained for the other datasets , and are omitted due to space limitations .",
    "we immediately note how static aggregation is an ineffective approach : the percentage of successfully merged @xmath1-tuples is well below 100% , even when dramatically reducing the data granularity to 8 hours in time and 20 km in space .",
    "instead , ` k - merge ` , w4 m and glove can merge all of the @xmath1-tuples , while retaining a good level of accuracy in the data .",
    "we can directly compare the granularity in time ( min ) and space ( km ) retained by ` k - merge ` , w4 m and glove in merging groups of @xmath1 trajectories : the spatiotemporal accuracy is comparable in all cases .",
    "however , it is important to note that w4 m attains this result by deleting and creating a significant amount of samples : in the end , only 40 - 70% of the original samples are maintained in the generalized data .",

    "the evolution of temporal granularity versus @xmath2 , in fig.[fig : tim_gran_vs_t_civ]- is consistent with citywide scenarios .",
    "differences emerge in terms of spatial granularity : in the ` civ ` case ( fig.[fig : pos_gran_vs_t_civ ] ) a reversed trend emerges , as accuracy grows along with the attacker knowledge .",
    "this counterintuitive result is explained by the thin user presence in the ` civ ` dataset : as per tab.[tbl : dataset_stats ] , ` civ ` has a density of subscribers per km@xmath19 that is one or two orders of magnitude lower than those in our other reference datasets .",
    "such a geographical sparsity makes it difficult to find individuals with similar spatial trajectories : increasing @xmath2 has then the effect of enlarging the set of candidate trajectories for merging at each epoch , with a positive influence on the accuracy in the generalized data .",
    "these considerations are confirmed by the results with the ` sen ` dataset ( fig.[fig : pos_gran_vs_t_sen ] ) . as per tab.[tbl : dataset_stats ] , this dataset features a subscriber density that is about one order of magnitude higher than that of ` civ ` , but around one order of magnitude lower than those of the ` abi ` , ` dak ` and ` shn ` .",
    "coherently , the spatial granularity trend falls in between those observed for such datasets , and it is not positively or negatively impacted by the attacker knowledge .",
    "more generally , the results in fig.[fig : gran_vs_t_nation ] demonstrate that ` kte - hide`can scale to large - scale real - world datasets .",
    "the absolute performance is good , as the @xmath0-anonymizeddata retains substantial precision : the median levels of granularity in space and time are comparable to those achieved in citywide datasets . finally , we remark that , in all cases , the amount of samples suppressed by ` kte - hide`is in the 1%7% range .      the amount of samples suppressed by ` kte - hide`in the @xmath0-anonymizationprocess is portrayed in fig.[fig : suppr_samples ] .",
    "we note that resorting to suppression becomes more frequent as the adversary knowledge increases . however , even when the opponent is capable of tracking a user during four continued hours , the percentage of suppressed samples remains low , typically well below 10% .",
    "moreover , the trend in the long - timespan datasets is clearly sublinear , suggesting that suppression does not become prevalent with higher @xmath2 .",
    "results are fairly consistent across citywide datasets = 1 hour in ` shn ` is due to the fact that the time interval @xmath14 is already very large , at around the same order of magnitude of the full dataset duration . ] .",
    "nationwide datasets are also aligned , and yield even lower suppression rates , at around 2% .",
    "this difference is explained by the fact that a larger number of users allows for a more efficient spectral clustering in ` kte - hide ` .      as an intriguing concluding remark , fig.[fig : abi_trend ] reveals a clear circadian rhythm in the granularity of @xmath0-anonymizeddata , as well as in the percentage of suppressed samples .",
    "the plots refer to one sample week in the ` abi ` and ` dak ` datasets , when @xmath2 = 30 min , but consistent results were observed in all of our reference datasets .",
    "specifically , the mean spatial granularity , in fig.[fig : pos_gran_trend_abi ] , is much finer during daytime , when subscribers are more active and the volume of trajectories is larger : here , it is easier to hide a user into the crowd .",
    "overnight displacements are instead harder to anonymize , since subscribers are limited in number and they tend to have diverse patterns .",
    "this is also corroborated by the significantly higher suppression of samples between midnight and early morning , in fig.[fig : blanked_trend_abi ] .",
    "time granularity , in fig.[fig : time_gran_trend_abi ] , is less subject to day - night oscillations : the slightly higher accuracy recorded at night is an artifact of the important relative suppression of samples at those times .",
    "overall , our results show that ` kte - hide`attains @xmath0-anonymityof real - world datasets of mobile traffic , while maintaining a remarkable level of accuracy in the data .",
    "interestingly , its performance is better when most needed , at daytime , when the majority of human activities take place .",
    "protection of individual mobility data has attracted significant attention in the past decade . however , attack models and privacy criteria are very specific to the different data collection contexts .",
    "hence , solutions developed for a specific type of movement data are typically not reusable in other environments .",
    "for instance , a vast amount of works have targeted user privacy in location - based services ( lbs ) . there , the goal is ensuring that single georeferenced queries are not uniquely identifiable  @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to anonymizing each spatiotemporal sample independently , and a whole other problem from protecting full trajectories .",
    "even when considering sequences of queries , the lbs milieu allows pseudo - identifier replacement , and most solutions rely on this approach , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "if applied to spatiotemporal trajectories , these techniques would seriously and irreversibly break up trajectories in time , disrupting data utility .",
    "another popular context is that of spatial trajectories that do not have a temporal dimension .",
    "the problem of anonymizing datasets of spatial trajectories has been thoroughly explored in data mining , and many practical solutions based on generalization have been proposed , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "such solutions are not compatible with or easily extended to the more complex spatiotemporal data we consider .",
    "some works explicitly target privacy preservation of spatiotemporal trajectories .",
    "however , the precise context they refer to makes again all the difference .",
    "first , most such solutions consider scenarios where user movements are sampled at regular time intervals that are identical for all individuals  @xcite , or where the number of samples per device is very small  @xcite .",
    "these assumptions hold , e.g. , for gps logs or rfid record , but not for trajectories recorded by mobile operators : the latter are irregularly sampled , temporally sparse , and cover long time periods , which results in at least hundreds of samples per user .",
    "second , many of the approaches above disrupt data utility , by , e.g. , trimming trajectories  @xcite , or violate the principles of ppdp , by , e.g. , perturbating or permutating the trajectories  @xcite , or creating fictitious samples  @xcite .",
    "third , all previous studies aim at attaining @xmath1-anonymity of spatiotemporal trajectories , i.e. , they protect the data against record linkage ; this includes recent work specifically tailored to mobile subscriber trajectory datasets  @xcite . as explained in sec.[sec : reqs ] , @xmath1-anonymity is only a partial countermeasure to attacks on spatiotemporal trajectories .",
    "provable privacy guarantees are instead offered by _",
    "differential privacy _ , which commends that the presence of a user s data in the published dataset should not change substantially the output of the analysis , and thus formally bounds the privacy risk of that user  @xcite .",
    "there have been attempts at using differential privacy with mobility data .",
    "specifically , it has been successfully used the in the lbs context , when publishing aggregate information about the location of a large number of users , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , the requirements of these solutions already become too strong in the case of individual lbs access data  @xcite . to address this problem , a variant of differential privacy , named",
    "_ geo - indistinguishability _ has been introduced : it requires that any two locations become more indistinguishable as they are geographically closer  @xcite .",
    "practical mechanisms achieve geo - indistinguishability , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , all refer to the anonymization of single lbs queries : as of today , differential privacy and its derived definitions still appear impractical in the context of spatiotemporal trajectories .",

    "<S> , the disclosure of individual trajectories raises significant privacy concerns : thus , these data are often protected by restrictive non - disclosure agreements that limit their availability and impede potential usages . in this paper , we contribute to the development of technical solutions to the problem of privacy - preserving publishing of spatiotemporal trajectories of mobile subscribers . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an algorithm that generalizes the data so that they satisfy @xmath0-anonymity , an original privacy criterion that thwarts attacks on trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> evaluations with real - world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm attains its objective while retaining a substantial level of accuracy in the data . </S>",
    "<S> our work is a step forward in the direction of open , privacy - preserving datasets of spatiotemporal trajectories . </S>"
