    "one of the recent challenges in condensed matter physics has been to understand quantum phases characterized by singular surfaces in momentum space .",
    "the canonical example of such a phase is the free fermi gas ( or more generally a fermi liquid ) , where the singular surface is simply the fermi surface .",
    "ironically , despite our immense theoretical understanding of the free fermi gas @xcite and the interacting fermi liquid , @xcite a controlled and unbiased _ numerical _ demonstration of such a phase in an interacting microscopic model of itinerant fermions moving in two or more dimensions is still extremely difficult .",
    "the main roadblocks in this numerical pursuit are ( 1 ) the infamous sign problem in quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite and ( 2 ) the anomalously large amount of spatial entanglement present in states with a fermi surface , @xcite thereby rendering recently developed sign problem - free tensor network state approaches inadequate with current techniques .",
    "@xcite although the most obvious and familiar , the free fermi gas and fermi liquid are not the only examples of phases with singular surfaces in momentum space .    since the discovery of the cuprate superconductors",
    ", interest has emerged in novel two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum phases that fall outside the paradigm of fermi liquid theory , but that still have correlations with singularities residing on one - dimensional ( 1d ) surfaces in momentum space .",
    "perhaps the most prominent example are states with a spinon fermi surface , so - called `` spin bose metals '' , which have both a long history in the context of the cuprates @xcite and also a renewed interest in the context of the organic materials  and .",
    "@xcite here , due to the presence of an emergent gauge field when going beyond mean field , a fermi - liquid - like quasiparticle description is inapplicable , thus making fully controlled analytics very challenging and further promoting the importance of numerics .",
    "not surprisingly though , numerics suffers from the same difficulties as before : ( 1 ) the sign problem is likely a necessary condition for realistic parent hamiltonians , and ( 2 ) the beyond boundary law scaling of spatial entanglement is likely the same as that encountered for free fermions .",
    "@xcite    we focus here on a closely related quantum phase , the `` @xmath0-wave bose liquid '' ( dbl ) .",
    "the dbl is an exotic quantum phase of uncondensed itinerant bosons moving on the two - dimensional square lattice first considered in ref .  .",
    "like states with a spinon fermi sea , even though the microscopic degrees of freedom are bosonic , the dbl too has a set of gapless excitations residing on 1d surfaces in momentum space , i.e. , `` bose surfaces , '' and so accessing the dbl in 2d using fully controlled techniques , either numerically or analytically , is no more tractable than for the spinon fermi sea .",
    "however , we make progress studying the dbl in a controlled way by continuing to employ the heretofore fruitful philosophy @xcite of building a picture of such a 2d phase through a sequence of controlled quasi-1d ladder studies . in fact , we believe that the very presence of singular surfaces in momentum space actually renders ladder studies more informative and allows us to circumvent some of the usual numerical and analytical difficulties . when placed on the @xmath1-leg ladder , a given 2d phase with a continuous set of gapless modes residing on a 1d surface should enter a phase that is a distinctive multi - mode quasi-1d descendant of the parent 2d phase , with a number of 1d gapless modes that grows linearly with @xmath1 ( used interchangeably with @xmath2 in this paper : @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite in such quasi-1d geometries , both numerics and analytics are on much stronger footing : in principle , potential parent hamiltonians can be solved numercially with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , @xcite which can then be supplemented with variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations @xcite using appropriate projected trial wave functions to help map out the phase diagram .",
    "despite the fact that the dbl is a strong - coupling phase that can not be characterized perturbatively in terms of the original bosons , the slave - particle approach on the ladders accesses the phase in a novel way that is tractable via a gauge theory that can be treated using conventional bosonization techniques .",
    "guided by this line of attack , we aim to accomplish two main goals in this paper : ( 1 ) establish the existence of an exotic metallic dbl phase , i.e. , a `` bose metal , '' on the four - leg ladder , which we will argue is both a close relative of the proposed 2d phase of ref .   and a nontrivial extension of the quasi-1d descendant dbl phase discovered on the two - leg ladder in ref .  ; and ( 2 ) elaborate on our previous work in ref .  , which argued for the existence of a novel , but fundamentally quasi-1d , gapless mott insulating phase on the three - leg ladder .",
    "we emphasize that while we have already presented highlights of the latter three - leg gapless mott insulator in a previous work , @xcite the former four - leg gapless bose metal constitutes a new and very exciting result .",
    "these two seemingly disparate phases are actually close relatives : they share a common parton gauge theory description , can be modeled within the same class of projected variational wave functions , and , finally , manifest themselves in the same microscopic model , all of which we will demonstrate in this work .",
    "the model wave function for the dbl is obtained by taking a product of two distinct slater determinants and evaluating them at identical coordinates ( gutzwiller projection ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total number of bosons . in the language of operators",
    ", this corresponds to writing the ( hard - core ) boson operator as a product of two fermionic partons : @xmath6 where the hard - core boson hilbert space is recovered by requiring that the densities of the two partons , @xmath7 , be the same at each lattice site , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the boson density at site @xmath10 . within a gauge theory framework ,",
    "the mean - field picture of the phase consists of two independent species of fermions hopping on the square lattice with anisotropic hopping ; the physical hilbert space is then obtained by strongly coupling the @xmath11 and @xmath12 fermions with opposite gauge charge to an emergent u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "@xcite if one takes the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) fermion to hop preferentially in the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) direction , then the corresponding wave function [ eq .  ( [ eqn : wf ] ) with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) being a filled fermi sea compressed in the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) direction ] has a characteristic @xmath0-wave sign structure;@xcite that is , the sign of the wave function goes through a sequence , @xmath17 , upon taking one particle around another and hence the label `` @xmath0-wave bose liquid . ''",
    "perhaps more importantly , as alluded to above , this projected wave function has power law singularities of various momentum space correlators , e.g. , the boson momentum distribution and density - density structure factor , residing on 1d surfaces in momentum space .",
    "@xcite these surfaces are perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the dbl and are crucial to our identification of quasi-1d descendants of the phase on the @xmath1-leg ladder .",
    "a strong - coupling analysis @xcite of the aforementioned gauge theory motivates a simple microscopic parent hamiltonian which can potentially harbor the dbl phase .",
    "this hamiltonian consists of usual nearest - neighbor hard - core boson hopping supplemented with an explicit frustrated four - site ring - exchange interaction ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "we focus on this model hamiltonian , the so - called `` @xmath20-@xmath21 model , '' extensively in this paper . for @xmath22",
    ", we expect a generic superfluid with the bosons condensed at @xmath23 and off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "it is in the regime where the ring - exchange term contributes appreciably to the overall hamiltonian that the @xmath0-wave bose liquid is expected to onset . in the strong - coupling limit of the lattice gauge theory for the dbl",
    ", the relative strength of the ring term to the hopping term , @xmath24 , increases with increasing hopping anisotropy between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 partons .",
    "thus , we expect the ring term to potentially stabilize the dbl phase , and , as in ref .   on the two - leg ladder , we do in fact remarkably find evidence for such a scenario on three- and four - leg ladder systems .",
    "+ to conclude this section , we now discuss several lines of motivation behind this work . aside from being intrinsically interesting in its own right , we believe the dbl phase is potentially relevant to modern - day experiments and other theoretical pursuits in a number of contexts , including high - temperature superconductors , ultracold atomic gases , and frustrated quantum magnets .",
    "we start by focusing on the first case , where we believe the ideas behind the dbl can be used to describe the charge sector of a particular conducting , non - fermi liquid phase of itinerant electrons , i.e. , a `` strange metal , '' which may possibly be related to the infamous strange metal phase of the cuprates . specifically , we have in mind the following scenario . in the spirit of the slave - boson treatment of the @xmath25-@xmath20 model ,",
    "@xcite one can ( excluding site double occupancy ) decompose the electron creation operator as a product of a slave boson ( `` chargon '' ) and a fermionic spinon : @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to a gauge theory formulation in which the spinons and slave bosons are coupled to an emergent gauge field . while it is natural in this context for the spinons to form a fermi sea ( see above ) , the behavior of the slave boson holds the key in determining the properties of the resulting electronic phase : if the slave bosons condense , a traditional fermi liquid phase is obtained , whereas if they do not , we may say that the phase is a `` non - fermi liquid . ''",
    "an example of how the latter case can be achieved involves further decomposing the slave boson into two fermionic partons just as we did for the real boson in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : partons ] ) : @xmath27 , where again @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is taken to fill a fermi see compressed in the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) direction , and now there are two emergent gauge fields needed to enforce the physical electronic hilbert space .",
    "this setup sets the stage for a theory of a `` @xmath0-wave metal '' phase . while we will present work on this phase elsewhere , both in 2d and on the two - leg ladder , we believe scaling up the picture of the charge sector to many legs ( as we do in this paper ) will be an informative endeavor toward an eventual theoretical understanding of the 2d `` @xmath0-wave metal . ''",
    "a direct experimental realization of the dbl can potentially be achieved in systems of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "although it has been proposed that the boson ring - exchange model [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : model ] ) ] can be engineered directly in a cold atom system , @xcite perhaps the most feasible scenario involves engineering a pair of mismatched fermi surfaces in a two - component fermi gas by introducing a hopping anisotropy between the two species .",
    "@xcite such anisotropy can be achieved with a spin - dependent ( more precisely `` hyperfine - state - dependent '' ) optical lattice , a setup that was experimentally first demonstrated several years ago .",
    "@xcite in the noninteracting limit , we then have a situation very similar to the mean - field description of the dbl phase as discussed above , i.e. , a system of two independent species of fermions characterized by a hopping anisotropy . however , a fundamental difference is that we are now talking about real fermionic atoms , as opposed to fermionic partons modeling real hard - core bosons [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : partons ] ) ] .",
    "what are the potential phases that such a system could enter upon adding local attractive interactions ?",
    "this question was first asked by feiguin and fisher in ref .",
    ", and although there are several possibilities within a bcs treatment , the most interesting scenario involves formed cooper pairs entering a `` metallic '' @xmath0-wave bose liquid state instead of bose condensing at a finite set of momenta .",
    "such a phase is not accessible in a mean - field bcs analysis ; however , it can be argued to be a reasonable outcome by observing that when deriving an effective boson hamiltonian within perturbation theory at strong coupling , a ring term identical to the one we consider in the pure boson context is generated for increased hopping anisotropy between the two fermion species .",
    "@xcite it is precisely this ring term that drives our boson system into a `` metallic '' dbl phase ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:4leg_42 ] and ref .  ) .",
    "thus , such a `` cooper pair bose metal '' ( cpbm ) may exist at strong hopping anisotropy and intermediate to strong attractive interactions .",
    "evidence for such a phase was in fact recently found in a genuine attractive hubbard model on the two - leg ladder in ref .  , and our results here on three and four legs in the pure boson context may warrant further future studies of the cpbm , both theoretically and experimentally .    a final line of motivation to study",
    "the dbl involves thinking of the hard - core boson ring model [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : model ] ) ] as the easy - plane limit of an su(2 ) invariant spin-1/2 model with four - spin cyclic ring exchange ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "in such a model , at zero magnetic field ( half - filling in the boson language ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) indicates , among other things , the presence of a spin - nematic uniaxial magnet intervening between a four - sublattice biaxial nel state and a fully gapped su(2 ) symmetric valence bond solid .",
    "@xcite the same model has also been studied on the two - leg ladder .",
    "@xcite using the same multi - leg ladder approach we employ here , it would be interesting to study this model in the presence of a zeeman field , which would correspond in the boson language to a finite chemical potential .",
    "because the 2d dbl is expected to be generically stable only at densities slightly below half - filling ( and likely not present at exactly half - filling ) , @xcite it is conceivable that such a model in a sector of non - zero net magnetization could enter a spin liquid phase related to our dbl .",
    "thus , understanding the physics of the dbl and the u(1 ) symmetric ring - exchange model of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : model ] ) represents a first step in understanding this putative spin liquid phase .",

    "more details can be found in appendix  [ app : gaugetheory ] .",
    "we can describe the @xmath0-wave bose liquid state by first re - expressing the bosonic operators as products of fermionic partons as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : partons ] ) . on the @xmath1-leg ladder ,",
    "each of the partons has the freedom to fill at most @xmath1 1d bands in momentum space corresponding to the @xmath1 transverse momenta ; e.g. , choosing periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath14 direction , we have @xmath33 for @xmath34 . from our mean - field understanding of the state",
    ", we expect the partons to occupy contiguous strips centered about @xmath35 in each band ; such strips can best be described as  fermi segments \" and the edges of each segment as ",
    "fermi points , \" the locations of which are the fermi wave vectors .",
    "these points are the locations where partons can gaplessly be added or removed from the system and lead naturally to the concept of right- and left - movers ( see , for example , fig .  [ fig:4leg_42bandcurves ] ) .",
    "labeling the right - movers momenta as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 refers to the two flavors of partons and @xmath38 labels the band , we can take the continuum limit in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath13 ) and then linearize the dispersions around each fermi point , capturing all the relevant low energy physics , and approximately decompose the partons as follows : @xmath39d_{\\alpha p}^{(k_y)\\dagger}(x ) , \\label{eqn : partdecomp}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and denotes the right- and left - movers .",
    "note that it is not necessary , in general , for either parton to occupy all @xmath1 bands ; therefore , @xmath38 in the sum runs only over the partially filled bands for each flavor @xmath41 . if the @xmath11 partons partially occupy @xmath42 bands and the @xmath12 partons partially occupy @xmath43 bands , we denote the resulting state as dbl@xmath44 $ ] .",
    "since the two flavors of partons are interchangeable , we can always choose @xmath45 . with this convention , the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) partons are most easily associated with those that hop preferentially in the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) direction as described in the introduction . finally ,",
    "if we sum up the fermi wave vectors for each parton , we recover the boson density @xmath46 : @xmath47    $ ] showing the fermi wave vectors for the right moving @xmath11 and @xmath12 partons .",

    "hence , a critical feature of the dbl@xmath44 $ ] is the existence of @xmath52 gapless 1d modes .",
    "the gauge theory also offers an explanation for the singular behavior observed at incommensurate wave vectors in momentum - space correlators such as the boson momentum distribution function , @xmath53 , and the density - density structure factor , @xmath54 , for the dbl ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : measurements ] for explicit definitions of these quantities ) .",
    "consider first @xmath53 , the fourier transform of the boson green s function , @xmath55 . in the mean - field treatment , @xmath56 ; that is , simply the product of the individual fermionic parton green s functions .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 will oscillate at various @xmath58 wave vectors and decay as @xmath59 ; these momenta correspond to the gapless addition / removal of a boson , which involves creating / destroying a @xmath11 and a @xmath12 parton at certain fermi points .",
    "when gauge field effects are taken into account , we expect these power laws to be altered for the different wave vectors with some oscillations dying off more quickly and some more slowly relative to the mean field . in appendix",
    "[ app : gaugetheory ] , we present a complete low - energy theory for the dbl phases on ladders , which , in principle , allows the exact calculation of all power law exponents",
    ". however , these exponents are also affected by short - range interactions and , due to the large number of parameters in the theory , we do not attempt to do these calculations explicitly . the gauge theory suggests a mechanism of amperean enhancement whereby added ( or removed ) partons with opposite group velocities are favored since their opposite gauge charges generate parallel currents , which will subsequently attract one another thereby satisfying the gauge constraint and realizing the physical bosons .",
    "assuming that the gauge interactions dominate in our theory , we can rely on the intuition of this amperean rule despite the effects of the short - range interactions mentioned above .",
    "thus we expect enhanced singularities in the momentum distribution function at wave vectors @xmath60 . as an example",
    ", the fermion bilinear @xmath61 corresponds to such an enhancement . these ",
    "bose points \" are the quasi-1d fingerprints of the  bose surfaces \" of the parent 2d dbl phase ; that is , the finite transverse momenta of the ladder slice through the 1d singular curves present in full 2d resulting in these points of singular behavior .",
    "it can be shown within the context of the gauge theory that the other wave vectors , @xmath62 , are always suppressed relative to the mean field . in momentum space",
    ", @xmath53 shows clearly those wave vectors that are enhanced with sharp peaks or kinks in the curve .",
    "turning now to the density - density correlator in real - space , this function can be approximated in the mean - field treatment as the average of the individual parton correlators : @xmath63/2 $ ] , and is therefore expected to oscillate at various  @xmath64 \" wave vectors and decay as @xmath59 .",
    "these can be thought of as particle - hole excitations between bands of the same flavor of parton .",
    "when the gauge field is turned on , the power law exponents will be modified and the amperean rule predicts that excitations corresponding to aligned gauge currents will again be enhanced .",
    "hence , we expect enhanced singularities in the density - density structure factor at wave vectors @xmath65 . as an example",
    ", the fermion bilinear @xmath66 corresponds to such an enhancement .",

    "while the dmrg method can readily be employed on any quasi-1d model to extract out measurements of the ground state correlation functions , at best , one would be able to say that these functions decay as power laws and oscillate at incommensurate wave vectors if the ground state were indeed some dbl@xmath44 $ ] . to make sense of the locations of these wave vectors ,",
    "we have developed a more direct test for the presence of this phase using variational wave functions and vmc .",
    "these wave functions can be thought of as crude representations of the dbl@xmath44 $ ] phase as described by the bosonized parton gauge theory in the previous section .",
    "following the motivation of our mean - field parton description , we start by writing the bosonic wave function as a product of two slater determinants wherein the orbitals occupied by the partons correspond to the band filling prescription laid out in the previous section ( see fig .  [ fig:4leg_42bandcurves ] ) . but such a wave function without any further constraints would simply correspond to that of two flavors of noninteracting spinless fermions .",
    "we must project this wave function into the space of the physical bosons ; i.e. , the set of positions of the partons must be equivalent in both determinants [ see eq .",

    "indeed , it is the agreement of these locations between the dmrg results and those of the most energetically competitive vmc states that forms the most compelling evidence for the existence of the dbl@xmath44 $ ] in a given model .",

    "different mean - field states can lead to the same physical wave function ( gauge redundancy ) . for our system and our practical purposes ,",
    "this can be summed up as follows : if one shifts the fermi sea of @xmath11 by momentum @xmath82 and simultaneously shifts the fermi sea of @xmath12 by momentum @xmath83 , the wave function remains unchanged .",
    "the most significant consequence of this property is that there exists some arbitrariness in the choice of parton boundary conditions .",
    "since we are going to be considering a finite system with periodic boundary conditions in both directions for the physical bosons , we actually have the option of choosing the parton boundary conditions , in each direction separately , to be both periodic or both antiperiodic .",

    "the classical solution also has a bragg peak in the @xmath48-@xmath48 current - current structure factor @xmath105 at @xmath570 with amplitude @xmath571 .",
    "we have measured @xmath48-@xmath48 current - current correlations with the dmrg ( data not shown ) , and although they appear weaker than the corresponding @xmath49-@xmath49 correlations , we still can not rule out a bragg peak at @xmath566 .",
    "finally , one can compute the boson momentum distribution within this naive framework .",
    "this calculation predicts bose condensation at wave vectors @xmath572 , which are interestingly the same wave vectors at which we see features in the dmrg .",
    "specifically , at these wave vectors , @xmath573 , respectively . to again get a feel for the numbers , these three amplitudes evaluated at @xmath309 and @xmath564 give @xmath574 .",
    "again , this simple classical analysis agrees fairly well qualitatively with the dmrg , which indeed indicates possible quasi - condensation at momenta @xmath572 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3legbcsf ] , top panel ) .",
    "the fact that such an exceedingly crude classical analysis qualitatively reproduces much of the dmrg data is quite remarkable .",
    "however , we caution that the above picture is likely not complete and could still be qualitatively wrong .",
    "indeed , more work can certainly be done to characterize this unusual quantum phase .",
    "for example , we have been unable to extract a meaningful central charge with the dmrg data , which points to @xmath232-@xmath575 for a @xmath223 system , while the quasi-1d bcsf phase described above should lead to a luttinger liquid with @xmath255 gapless mode .",
    "it may be that the dmrg entanglement entropy is anomalously large due to the large ground state degeneracy in the putative bcsf phase , and @xmath255 scaling only emerges at much longer length scales .    upon doping the half - filled three - leg system to boson density @xmath143 ,",
    "the putative bcsf phase discussed above appears to persist , at least for sizable @xmath190 and intermediate @xmath21 , e.g. , @xmath191 and @xmath576 . for smaller values of @xmath190 , e.g. , @xmath577 ,",
    "we rather remarkably find dmrg evidence for the dbl@xmath30^\\dagger$ ] state in which the @xmath11 partons equally fill the three bands . in this case , there is a conserved number of bosons in each chain and thus zero rung current in the projected wave function : @xmath578 .",
    "loosely speaking , the small value of @xmath190 has a tendency to suppress rung currents and seems to stabilize the decoupled chains limit of so - called dbl@xmath30^\\dagger$ ] , though this is the only incarnation of this phase that we have been able to realize in the dmrg .",
    "also , dbl@xmath30^\\dagger$ ] does not appear to exist at @xmath309 , even at small @xmath190 , which is at least somewhat surprising .",
    "because the dbl@xmath30^\\dagger$ ] is obviously very far removed from 2d , we do not pursue understanding it any further .    in conclusion , the identified putative three - leg bcsf phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3legbcsf ] ) is itself rather interesting and worthy of further investigation .",
    "we stress that we found no evidence for such a phase on the four - leg ladder at any density ; e.g. , we found no evidence of long - range order in current - current correlations . in that case , our dbl@xmath28 $ ] is stabilized for densities slightly below @xmath309 ( e.g. , @xmath143 ) , while at @xmath309 , the conventional @xmath23 superfluid was the only compressible phase identified .",
    "thus , exactly how all of these @xmath32 three - leg results and our @xmath579 four - leg results ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:4leg ] ) extrapolate to 2d , if at all , is not presently clear . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4leg ] , we presented strong evidence in support of the existence and stability of a very 2d - like dbl phase on four legs , namely , the so - called dbl@xmath28 $ ] ; however , as we have discussed in this appendix , an analogous phase does not appear to exist for the three - leg system .",
    "generally speaking , we do believe odd - leg systems are somewhat pathological when approaching 2d in this context because they are not bipartite , thus putting the half - filled system on qualitatively different footing than what we would expect in 2d .",
    "still , to further investigate this seemingly strong even - odd effect , in addition to going to more legs ( which is becoming exceedingly difficult at this point ) , it may be insightful to modify the transverse ( @xmath49 direction ) boundary condition for the boson model [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fullmodel ] ) ] . in this work",
    ", we have only considered periodic transverse boundary conditions in both the three- and four - leg systems . however ,",
    "the structure of the dbl@xmath28 $ ] identified on four legs suggests that an anti - periodic boundary condition may be desirable to stabilize the sought - after dbl@xmath219 $ ] for @xmath32 on three legs .",
    "namely , because the structure of the stable four - leg dbl@xmath28 $ ] relies on anti - periodic transverse boundary conditions for both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 partons , a more natural three - leg dbl@xmath219 $ ] configuration than that discussed at the beginning of this appendix might consist of a periodic boundary condition for @xmath11 and an anti - periodic boundary condition for @xmath12 .",
    "this configuration is only possible with an anti - periodic boundary condition for the boson system .",
    "we leave such further exploration for future work .",
    "these effects illustrate the degree of difficulty encountered when trying to extrapolate results from quasi-1d ladder studies to make definitive statements about 2d physics , especially when trying to understand a phase as complicated as the dbl in a nontrivial model such as the @xmath20-@xmath21 model .",
    "however , we believe our four - leg results of sec .",
    "[ sec:4leg_42 ] are more representative of the 2d system than the three - leg results summarized above in this appendix : firstly , in contrast to the three - leg ladder , the four - leg ladder is a bipartite lattice ( also , four is greater than three ) , and secondly , fully periodic boundary conditions are the most natural choice for approaching full 2d .",
    "we now address the situation on the two - leg ladder at half - filling ( @xmath309 ) . in this system , it is in principle possible for a gapless mott insulating phase , i.e. , a dbl@xmath310 $ ] in our naming convention , to exist for large @xmath21 .",
    "a nontrivial solvable limit is when @xmath248 , in which the number of bosons in each rung is conserved and is exactly one for @xmath309 . in this regime , we can map the model exactly to the spin-1/2 xy chain with an in - plane magnetic field ( identifying a boson on the upper chain as spin up and a boson on the lower chain as spin down ) : @xmath580 where @xmath581 are the pauli matrices for the pseudospin on rung @xmath292 .",
    "when @xmath302 , the xy model is solved by a jordan - wigner transformation and has one 1d gapless mode corresponding to the free fermion .",
    "@xmath190 is relevant at this xy fixed point and immediately causes the formation of a canted magnet ( uniform moment along @xmath285 and staggered moment along @xmath233 ) before entering the trivial pseudospin paramagnet ( staggered moment along @xmath233 goes to zero ) at large @xmath190 .",
    "@xcite in the two - leg ladder boson language , this corresponds to a staggered rung current state and the featureless rung mott insulator , respectively ; the transition between these two gapped phases is continuous and is of the ising universality class .",
    "the phase diagram at @xmath248 can be logically extended into the entire @xmath582 plane without the introduction of an exotic gmi phase .",
    "indeed , we have verified this with dmrg and found no evidence for a gmi phase at nonzero @xmath190 .",
    "in addition to the staggered rung current phase mentioned above , a @xmath313 cdw appears at intermediate @xmath24 and small @xmath583 .",
    "remarkably , a bosonization analysis of the putative two - leg gmi phase predicts an allowed instability toward either @xmath313 static order in the density or @xmath128 static order in the rung currents , both of which we actually observe in the dmrg .",
    "finally , we note that two very recent works @xcite have considered in detail hard - core bosons hopping on the two - leg ladder without ring exchange , i.e. , our @xmath20-@xmath312-@xmath21 model with @xmath22 . in these works",
    ", it was shown that at half - filling the system enters a rung mott insulating phase for any finite @xmath190 , although the charge gap grows exponentially slowly with @xmath190 , i.e. , as @xmath584 , and is extremely difficult to deal with numerically due to a large value of the constant factor @xmath585 in the exponential . @xcite in our dmrg study of the two - leg half - filled system , we observed what looked like a superfluid on finite - size systems for small @xmath21 ; however , we did not perform an extensive finite - size analysis of this system as in ref .  .",
    "it is therefore possible that the apparent superfluid is a rung mott phase on long length scales , and there are only direct transitions between the rung mott phase and the staggered rung current and @xmath313 cdw phases mentioned above .    to conclude , although we were able to successfully identify a gmi phase on the three - leg ladder ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:3leg ] and ref .  )",
    ", analogous phases do not exist on the two- and four - leg systems , at least with our model , boundary conditions , etc .",
    "this again suggests a rather strong even - odd effect similar to what we found above for conducting dbl phases at incommensurate densities ."
