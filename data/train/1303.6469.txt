    "given a controlled dynamical system described by a differential ( continuous - time ) or difference ( discrete - time ) equation , its maximum controlled invariant ( mci ) set is the set of all initial states that can be kept within a given constraint set ad  infinitum using admissible control inputs .",
    "this set goes by many other names in the literature , e.g. , viability kernel in viability theory  @xcite , or @xmath0-invariant set in the linear case  @xcite .",
    "set invariance is an ubiquitous and essential concept in dynamical systems theory , as far as both analysis and control synthesis is concerned . in particular , by its very definition , the mci set determines fundamental limitations of a given control system with respect to constraint satisfaction .",
    "in addition , there is a very tight link between invariant sets and ( control ) lyapunov functions . indeed , sub - level sets of a lyapunov function give rise to invariant sets .",
    "conversely , at least in the linear case , any controlled invariant set gives rise to a control lyapunov function , and therefore these sets can be readily used to design stabilizing control laws ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a general treatment and , e.g. , @xcite for applications in model predictive control design .",
    "the problem of ( maximum ) controlled invariant set computation for discrete - time systems has been a topic of active research for more than four decades .",
    "the central tool in this effort has been the contractive algorithm of  @xcite and its expansive counterpart  @xcite . for an exhaustive survey and historical remarks",
    "see the survey  @xcite and the book  @xcite .    both algorithms ,",
    "although conceptually applicable to any nonlinear system , have been predominantly applied in a linear setting where they boil down to a sequence of linear programs and polyhedral projections .",
    "finite termination of this sequence is a subtle problem and sharp results are available only in the uncontrolled setting where no projections are required  @xcite ; for discussion of finite - termination in the controlled case see  @xcite .",
    "the contractive and expansive algorithms were combined in  @xcite to design an algorithm terminating in a finite number of iterations and outputting an @xmath1-accurate inner approximation of the mci set ( with the accuracy measured by the hausdorff distance ) .",
    "another line of research , culminating in  @xcite , exploits the linearity of the system dynamics in a more systematic way and approximates the maximum ( or minimum ) _ robust _ controlled invariant set by the minkowski sum of a parametrized family of sets . very recently , in continuous time , @xcite developed a parallel algorithm for ellipsoidal approximations of the robust mci set scalable to very high dimensions .",
    "computation of low - complexity polyhedral controlled invariant sets was investigated in  @xcite and @xcite .    in the nonlinear case ,",
    "a common practice is to exploit the tight connection between invariance and lyapunov functions and seek invariant sets as sub - level sets of a ( control ) lyapunov function ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for recent theoretical developments on the related problem of region of attraction computation and , e.g. , @xcite for practical applications of these techniques .",
    "this , however , typically leads to non - convex bilinear optimization problems which are notoriously hard to solve .",
    "therefore , one often has to resort to ad - hoc analysis of the specific system at hand , which is typically tractable only in small dimensions ; see  @xcite for concrete examples .",
    "related in spirit is the localization technique of  @xcite for discrete - time _ uncontrolled _",
    "systems , also requiring considerable effort in analysing the system .",
    "recently , a general approach using a hierarchy of finite - dimensional linear programs ( lps ) was used in @xcite to design a controller ensuring invariance of a given candidate polyhedral set . in our opinion , although being the current state of the art , this work still suffers from the following drawbacks : 1 ) the sets obtained are convex polytopes ( not general semi - algebraic sets , a fact particularly limiting in the nonlinear case where nonconvex mci sets are common ) ; 2 ) the geometry of the candidate polytopic set must be given a priori ; 3 ) there are no convergence guarantees to the mci set . in this paper , we explicitly address all these points .    building upon our previous work @xcite on the computation of the region of attraction ( roa ) for polynomial control systems , in this paper we characterize the maximum controlled invariant ( mci ) set for discrete- as well as continuous - time polynomial systems as the solution to an infinite - dimensional lp problem in the cone of nonnegative measures .",
    "the dual of this problem is an infinite - dimensional lp in the space of continuous functions .",
    "finite - dimensional _ relaxations _ of the primal lp and finite - dimensional _ approximations _ of the dual lp turn out to be semidefinite programs ( sdps ) also related by duality .",
    "the primal relaxations lead to a truncated moment problem while the dual approximations to a sum - of - squares ( sos ) problem .",
    "super - level sets of one of the polynomials appearing in the dual sos problem then provide outer approximations to the mci set with guaranteed convergence as the degree of the polynomial tends to infinity .",
    "the main mathematical tool we use are the so - called occupation measures which allow us to study the time evolution of the whole ensemble of initial conditions ( described by a measure ) rather than studying trajectories associated to each initial condition separately .",
    "the use of measures to study dynamical systems has a very long tradition : see  @xcite for probably the first systematic treatment ; for purely discrete - time treatment see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  6 ) . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    "our paper is the first one to use occupation measures for mci set ( approximate ) _",
    "computation_. the mci set was previously _ characterized _ using occupation measures in  @xcite , but there the characterization is rather indirect and not straightforwardly amenable to computation .",
    "apart from the authors work  @xcite , the related problem of region of attraction computation was tackled using measures in  @xcite . there , however , a very different approach was taken , not using _ occupation _ measures but rather analyzing convergence via discretization of the state - space and propagating the initial distribution by means of a discretized transfer operator . here , instead",
    ", we employ the ( discounted ) occupation measure which captures the behaviour of the trajectories emanating from the initial distribution over the infinite time horizon . as a result",
    ", our approach requires no discretization and , contrary to  @xcite , provides true guarantees ( not in an `` almost - everywhere '' or `` coarse '' sense ) and , more importantly , is applicable in a controlled setting .",
    "closely related to the occupation measures used here is the rantzer s density  @xcite which was used in  @xcite to assess the stability of attractor sets of uncontrolled nonlinear systems .",
    "the approach , however , does not immediately yield approximations of the mci set ( or the region of attraction ) and applies to uncontrolled systems only .",
    "similar in spirit to our approach , from the dual viewpoint of optimization over functions , are the hamilton - jacobi approaches ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", contrary to these methods , our approach does not require state - space discretization and comes with convergence guarantees .",
    "the contribution of our paper with respect to previous work on the topic can be summarized as follows :    * we deal with fully general continuous - time and discrete - time polynomial dynamics under semi - algebraic state and control constraints ; * our approximated mci set is described by ( the intersections of ) polynomial super - level sets , including more restrictive classes ( e.g. polytopes , ellipsoids , etc . ) ; * we provide a convex infinite - dimensional lp characterization of the mci set ; * we describe a hierarchy of convex finite - dimensional sdps to solve the lp with convergence guarantees ; * our approach is simple and readily applicable in the sense that the approximations are the result of a single sdp with _ no additional data _ required apart from the problem description .    the contribution with respect to our previous work @xcite",
    "can be summarised as follows :    * in @xcite we compute the roa , which is a related although different object : it is the set of all of initial conditions that can be steered to a given target set while satisfying state and control constraints .",
    "in particular , the mci set differs from the roa in the sense that we do not try to hit any target set at a given time but rather try to keep the state within a given set forever .",
    "therefore we had to adapt our technique to deal explicitly with invariance ; * in @xcite we dealt with continuous - time systems only , whereas we can cope , with minor modifications , with discrete - time systems as well ; we choose to describe both the continuous - time and discrete - time setups in parallel precisely to underline these common features ; * in @xcite we considered only a finite time - horizon , whereas here we show how to cope , with the help of discounting , with an infinite horizon .",
    "this brought additional technical issues not encountered in finite time .",
    "what can be considered a drawback of our approach is the fact that the approximations to the mci set we obtain are from the outside and therefore not invariant .",
    "however , accurate outer approximations provide important information as to the performance limitations of the control system and are of practical interest , e.g. , in collision avoidance .",
    "therefore we believe that our work bears both theoretical and practical value , and naturally complements existing inner - approximation techniques .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the problem to be solved is described in section  [ sec : probstate ] .",
    "occupation measures are introduced in section  [ sec : om ] .",

    "numerical examples are in section  [ sec : numex ] .",
    "a reader interested only in the semialgebraic outer approximations of the mci set can consult directly the infinite - dimensional dual lps  ( [ vlpd ] ) and ( [ vlpc ] ) and their finite - dimensional approximations  ( [ dlmid ] ) and ( [ dlmic ] ) in discrete and continuous time , respectively .      measures are understood as signed borel measures on a euclidean space , i.e. , as countably additive maps from the borel sets to the real numbers . from now on all subsets of a euclidean space we refer to are automatically understood as borel .",

    "therefore , from a practical point of view , there is little difference between the two formulations for the purposes of mci set computation ; see section  3.2 and appendices b and c of  @xcite for a detailed discussion on this subtle issue .",
    "the simplest assumption under which the mci sets for both systems coincide is @xmath39 being convex for all @xmath40 , which is in particular true for input - affine systems of the form @xmath41 with @xmath38 convex .",
