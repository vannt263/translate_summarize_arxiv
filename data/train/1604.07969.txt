    "realized moments of higher order computed from intraday returns are introduced in recent years .",
    "this article conducts an extensive empirical analysis to investigate the forecasting abilities of realized skewness and realized kurtosis towards the stock s future return and variance .",
    "it is found that realized kurtosis possesses significant forecasting power for the stock s future variance .",
    "+ @xcite firstly introduces _ realized skewness _ of the asset price returns .",
    "@xcite further defines _ realized kurtosis_. realized moments defined in the above papers",
    "are constructed by the empirical sum of the corresponding powers of returns , which we call the naive estimator .",
    "however , the naive estimator is consistent only in the absence of microstructure noise , which must be dealt with other more sophisticated approaches .",
    "+ based on the pre - averaging method in @xcite for constructing realized variance , @xcite introduces the pre - averaging estimator for realized skewness and kurtosis .",
    "in addition , they prove the consistency of the estimators in the presence of mircostructure noise . they also find that realized skewness of the market price has significant forecasting power for the one - month - ahead excess equity market returns , by evidence from both in - sample and out - of - sample analysis . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigate whether realized skewness and realized kurtosis are informative for next week s stock returns .",
    "they find that realized skewness has a significant negative effect on future stock returns .",
    "the authors also demonstrate the significance in economic sense that buying stocks with lowest realized skewness and selling stocks with highest realized skewness generates a profit significantly .",
    "in addition , realized kurtosis exhibits a positive relationship with the weekly returns , even though the evidence is not always robust and statistically significant .",
    "this motivates the question of whether the same conclusion could be applied to the individual stock and for a shorter period , say one day , as people often focus more on the short - term profit in the stock market nowadays . continuing exploration along the line , we investigate in this paper whether higher realized moments have explaining power on variances of future assets , as estimated by realized variance .",
    "+ in empirical study , we show that in contrast with @xcite and @xcite , realized skewness does not show enough explanatory power for future daily returns .",
    "we conduct regression analysis towards @xmath0 randomly selected stocks from different industries and capitalization sizes .",
    "we find that the forecasting ability of realized skewness is statistically significant for only @xmath1 out of @xmath0 stocks . on the other hand , realized kurtosis , which is able to reflect the price jump size , shows strong evidence of forecasting power for future realized variances .",
    "thirty two out of the same @xmath0 stocks are shown to have the property .",
    "moreover , we find that the square root of realized kurtosis has an even better forecasting ability for future realized variances .",
    "+ in addition , we compare the forecasting ability of realized kurtosis with other well - known variables , which may help in predicting asset s volatility , namely trading volume and signed daily return . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors conduct regression analysis of realized volatility against trading volume , trading frequency , average trading size and order imbalance .",
    "trading volume is comprised of trading frequency and average trading size , while order imbalance is the difference between the number of trades initiated by buyers and sellers .",
    "the authors find that daily trading volume and trading frequency give equally good predictions on realized volatility , while average trading size and order imbalance adds little explaining power .",
    "therefore , in our empirical analysis , we only include daily trading volume as a possible covariate .",
    "furthermore , signed returns are also informative for the volatility , especially for negative returns , which is usually interpreted as the _ leverage effect_. the effect is firstly discussed by @xcite and @xcite , and is due to the reason that a negative return leads to an increase in the debt - to - equity ratio , resulting in an increase in the future volatility of the return @xcite . in this article",
    ", we include both positive and negative daily returns as covariates .",
    "we find that in the presence of trading volume and signed daily returns , realized kurtosis still exhibits nice predicting power , in general .",
    "+ in summary , the main findings of the paper are the following :    * realized skewness is lack of explanatory power for the future daily return for individual stocks with a short horizon .",
    "* realized kurtosis exhibits significant forecasting power for the future realized variance . *",

    "+ to explore the forecasting power of realized kurtosis on the daily volatility , we adopt the regression models in section 3 , namely equations ( 21 ) , ( 24 ) , ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "in addition , we use the stepwise method with the aic to select adequate covariates for the regression of the future realized variance .",

    "the first column exhibits the stock variables .",
    "the second to fifth columns show the significance of the coefficient for realized kurtosis in equation ( 21 ) , ( 24 ) , ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) , respectively .",
    "for example , the second entry in the first row , @xmath169 , indicates that the second column shows the forecasting performance of realized kurtosis in the presence of daily return and realized skewness .",
    "the numbers shown in the table stand for the different level of significance .",
    "`` @xmath170 '' stands for not significant , with p - value bigger than @xmath171 ; `` @xmath172 '' stands for marginally significant , with p - value between @xmath173 and @xmath171 ; `` 1 '' stands for significant , with p - value between @xmath174 and @xmath173 ; `` 2 '' stands for very significant , with p - value between @xmath175 and @xmath174 ; and `` 3 '' stands for extremely significant , with p - value less than @xmath175 .",
    "the last column indicates the result of the covariate selection .",
    "the potential covariates include realized skewness , realized kurtosis , trading volume and positive and negative daily returns .",
    "the number `` @xmath176 '' in some entries of the last column means that no covariate is selected .",
    "+ it is found from table @xmath177 that in general realized kurtosis always shows significant explaining power when trading volume is absent . when trading volume is added , realized kurtosis sometimes exhibits no significant power in forecasting the volatility .",
    "we mention above that this may be because realized kurtosis and trading volume share some common information .",
    "furthermore , for the small capitalization group in the covariate selection , 7 of 10 stocks include the realized kurtosis , 5 of 10 stocks include trading volume and only 1 of 10 includes neither of them .",
    "for the medium size group , 6 of 10 stocks include realized kurtosis as a covariate , 5 of 10 include trading volume and only 1 excludes both of them . for large size companies , 19 of 30 stocks include realized kurtosis , 14 of 30 include trading volume and 3 of 30 include neither of this two covariates .",
    "the performance of realized kurtosis and trading volume is stable , with respect to stocks with different sizes and different sectors .",
    "+ in the above regression analysis , we use realized kurtosis as a covariate for realized variance . however , the orders of the two variables are not the same from equation ( 18 ) . as a result",
    ", we take the square root of realized kurtosis to make it of the same order with realized variance , and then conduct the same regression analysis .",
    "the result is shown in table @xmath178 .",
    "remember that all @xmath26 s in table @xmath178 stand for the square root of realized kurtosis . + it is found that the square root of realized kurtosis performs better in explaining the future daily volatility , as shown by columns 2 to 5 of table [ resultsqrtrk ] . when all possible covariates are counted in , the square root of realized kurtosis shows a significant effect on the future realized variance in 38 of the 50 cases .",
    "furthermore , for the small capitalization group in the covariate selection , 7 of 10 stocks include realized kurtosis , 4 of 10 stocks include trading volume and only 1 of 10 includes neither of them . for the medium size group , 9 of 10 stocks include realized kurtosis as a covariate , 4 of 10 include trading volume and no stocks excludes neither of them . for large size companies , 25 of 30 stocks include realized kurtosis , 10 of 30 include trading volume and only 1 of 30 includes neither of this two covariates .",
    "we see that the performance of the square root of realized kurtosis is even better than that of realized kurtosis , especially for the firms with medium and large sizes .",
    "in addition , it seems that the square root of realized kurtosis and trading volume are able to account for almost all explaining power for the future daily volatility , in general .",
    "+ from equation ( 18 ) , realized variance converges to the sum of two parts , the integrated variance and the sum of the square of jumps . additionally , realized kurtosis converges to the sum of the fourth power of price jumps .",
    "as a consequence , it is natural to wonder if realized kurtosis possesses some explaining power for realized variance as they both have a jump component .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case . in @xcite",
    ", the authors separate the two components of realized variance to check for the contribution of the jump component . in the empirical study , they find that the jump component only accounts for @xmath179 of stock market price variance , which indicates that it is the continuous component that dominates . as a result , why the previous - day price jump affects the continuous price fluctuation is worth considering .",
    "in addition , even if the jump part is really important for daily volatility , we know that the jump of the price always corresponds to the unexpected arrival of new information , so that it is unnatural that the previous - day jump has strong forecasting power on future s jumps . nevertheless , we separate out the continuous component of realized variance , estimated by the bipower variation .",
    "we conduct all the regression models with respect to the bipower variation to see whether the explanatory power of the square root of realized kurtosis remains .",
    "the result is shown in table @xmath180 .",
    "+ it is found that on average , the square root of realized kurtosis remains powerful in predicting the future daily bipower variation , shown by columns 2 to 5 of table [ resultsqrtrkbv ] . however , the performance is slightly worse than that under realized variance , which is also shown in the covariate selection column . for stocks with small capitalization , 7 of 10 stocks",
    "include realized kurtosis , 6 of 10 stocks include trading volume and only 2 of 10 include neither of them .",
    "for the medium size , 7 of 10 stocks include realized kurtosis as a covariate , 5 of 10 include trading volume and only 1 excludes both of them . for large size companies , 23 of 30 stocks include realized kurtosis , 11 of 30 include trading volume and 3 of 30 include neither of this two covariates . + in summary , we use the following graphs to illustrate the overall performance of the regressors . in figures [ f11]-[f13 ] , each bar represents the forecasting performance in one regression model involving the variables shown below the bar .",
    "different filling patterns stand for the level of significance for realized kurtosis or the square root of realized kurtosis , shown by the legend , for example , horizontal line means realized kurtosis is significant , with p - value between @xmath174 and @xmath173 .",

    ", we see that the ( square root of ) realized kurtosis always performs better in the absence of trading volume . nevertheless , the overall performance of the ( square root of ) realized kurtosis is satisfactory .",
    "the worst case is when we add all variables in the regression models for realized kurtosis , where about @xmath181 of the stocks still indicate the significance of realized kurtosis forecasting the future realized variance . from figure [ f14 ] , we see that the performance of the square root of realized kurtosis forecasting realized variance is always the best among the three no matter what the regression model is . + it appears that realized kurtosis , whether taking the square root or not , measures the price jump size to some extent .",
    "it contains information for the future daily volatility , possibly due to the following reasons .",
    "firstly , @xcite points out that the continuous part of the stock volatility may be due to the change in the economic anticipation and the temporary imbalance between supply and demand .",
    "moreover , sometimes the price jumps are incidental , which correspond to the newly arrived news to the market . when the market is unable to digest the news efficiently , the news effect aggregates and the jump should have some forecasting power for the future volatility .",
    "this is also indicated by the result that the long horizon forecasting performance of realized kurtosis becomes worse since the news has been digested gradually by the market after a long time .",
    "additionally , sometimes the price jump is artificial , i.e. the price jump is due to manipulation by some large financial institutions . in this case",
    ", the market will fluctuate corresponding to the reaction of the public and partly the follow - up actions by the institutions .",
    "consequently , the future volatility has some relationships with previous price jumps .",
    "certainly , there remain some other reasons , undiscovered .",
    "in this paper , we analyse whether higher realized moments have explaining power for future daily returns or realized variance .",
    "we find that realized skewness provides not enough evidence of the forecasting power for daily returns , in contrast with the literature . on the other hand , realized kurtosis exhibits significant forecasting power for the future realized variance in short period .",
    "furthermore , the square root of realized kurtosis shows even better forecasting ability .",
    "+ however , it is found that in the regression analysis , the @xmath97 is low , even though the effect of realized kurtosis is significant , which indicates that the prediction can not be very precise when linear regression models are used .",
