    "ex hya is an intermediate polar ( ip ) , a sub - class of magnetic cataclysmic variable stars ( mcvs ) where a late - type main sequence star transfers material to the magnetic white dwarf star as the two stars orbit each other under the influence of their mutual gravitation . unlike in polars ,",

    "ex hya , however , is nearer synchronism than the majority of ips as it has a spin period ( @xmath867.03 min ) which is about @xmath9 its orbital period ( 98.26 min ) @xcite , and is one of only six out of thirty nine confirmed ips with its orbital period below the 2 - 3 h cv period gap @xcite .",

    "this system has a large @xmath11 ratio ( @xmath12 ) implying that it can not be in the usual spin equilibrium rotation since most ips have been shown to attain spin equilibrium near @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this further implies that the corotation radius is far greater than the circularisation radius ( @xmath14 ) and that ex hya can not possess a keplerian disc .",

    "the 1991 tomograms showed similar results .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the disc emission in 1991 came from the outer disc than in 2001 .",
    "even though the mem and bpm pick out the same features , in the bp tomograms some features are more prominent than in the mem tomograms while the reconstruction obtained using the mem reproduces the observed data well .",

    "the presence of the overflow stream may be infered from this observation @xcite . but",
    "direct evidence comes from orbital doppler tomograms which show an asymmetry in the emission , where more emission is observed from the secondary  roche lobe to the lower left quadrant than from the opposite side .",
    "average - subtracted orbital tomograms show this emission at higher velocities ( @xmath8900 - 1000 km s@xmath1 ) ( figures  [ q : habegatrl ] and  [ q : habegaidltrl ] ) , and it corresponds to the hvc observed in the trailed spectra , which is modulated with a velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath83 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this hvc is reminiscent of that detected by rosen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) in the trailed spectra of the am her system v834 cen .",
    "their hvc was blueshifted with a velocity of @xmath85 km s@xmath1and was said to be produced in the stream close to the white dwarf .",
    "the only difference is that there was no evidence of the hvc emission when it was expected to be seen redward of another component ( medium - velocity component ) in their data , whereas in ex hya the evidence of the hvc emission is missing between @xmath86 .",
    "the hvc emission is maximally blueshifted at @xmath87 .",
    "this phasing is consistent with the expected phase of impact of a stream of material from the secondary  with the disc or of the overflow stream material free - falling onto the magnetosphere of the primary  @xcite .",
    "support for overflow stream is also provided by spin tomograms where emission is observed on the upper accretion curtain with velocities consistent with stream velocities .",
    "this suggests that this emission site may also have resulted due to impact of overflow stream with the magnetosphere .",
    "the resulting emission is receding from the observer at maximum redshift  near @xmath88 ( figure  [ q : habgspintrlmem ] ) , in agreement with the accretion curtain model .",
    "the model of @xcite is not fully supported by our observations since it predicts direct accretion via a stream .",
    "our observations , however , fit the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "was formed .",
    "both the narrow and broad base components fall along the same radial direction , oa , resulting in similar phase variation.,width=226 ]    there is evidence for strong h@xmath6  emission of the narrow s - wave component in the spin tomograms , centred around @xmath89 km s@xmath1  ( figure  [ q : habgspintrlmem ] ) , that is not accounted for by these models .",
    "this emission shows maximum blueshift  at phase @xmath90 , suggesting that these are rotational velocities ( or a combination of streaming and rotational velocities ) of the antiphased motion of a source locked to the white dwarf .",
    "one possible explanation is that this emission comes from the opposite pole of the white dwarf , at a radial distance of 6@xmath79 cm ( @xmath88r@xmath91 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the eclipsed optical source in ex hya is centred at a radial distance of 1.5@xmath79 cm ( @xmath82r@xmath91 ) , which is about four times closer to the white dwarf  compared to our result .",
    "this could be the same emission region , but in our observations the emission is spread out , possibly due to the quality of the data , and this could account for the difference in the radial distance values quoted above .",
    "but we can not imagine a geometry where such low rotational velocities can dominate over streaming velocities along the field lines near the white dwarf .",
    "we therefore suggest that this is evidence for material that is diverted out of the orbital plane .",
    "since one of the assumptions of doppler tomography is that everything lies on the plane , it is not possible to locate the exact position of this emission relative to the white dwarf .",
    "@xcite showed that maximum line widths of @xmath92 km s@xmath1  constrain the mass of the white dwarf , and a free - fall velocity of this magnitude could be achieved for white dwarf  masses greater than 0.48 m@xmath40 .",
    "we found m@xmath93 , in good agreement with the results obtained from recent studies by @xcite and @xcite .    for the secondary",
    ", we derived m@xmath94 m@xmath40 from the secondary mass - period relation of smith & dhillon ( 1988 ) , and this value agrees with that obtained by @xcite . @xcite and @xcite find lower values for m@xmath95 consistent with 0.09 m@xmath40 .",
    "@xcite argues that for a secondary  mass as low as 0.1 m@xmath40 the secondary would have to be substantially expanded by @xmath810% .",
    "we propose a model where one of the two chunks alluded to by belle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which are formed by the magnetic pull along the accretion ring , co - rotates with the accretion curtains at the outer edge of the roche lobe at @xmath8 500 - 600 km s@xmath1 , giving rise to the pulsation of emission at the spin period which we observe in our data , while the other is hidden by the accretion curtain below the ring of material .",
    "the resulting emission is maximally blueshifted near @xmath96 ( figure  [ rv : hbg_245sppr ] ) . in the accretion curtain model , at @xmath97 in the spin cycle , minimum flux ( due to higher opacity ) is observed when the upper accretion pole of the white dwarf  is pointed towards the observer @xcite , and so the phasing mentioned above is compatible with the motion of a rotating accretion funnel .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ o : qexillus2b ] , where the position of the observer at pulse maximum is indicated , and the axis of the magnetic pole is shown .",
    "the disruption of the disc by the magnetic field at the outer disc is illustrated and part of the disc co - rotating with the magnetosphere is shown . at a corotation radius ,",
    "@xmath98 @xmath99 ( @xmath100 cm ) , the material is rotating at a velocity of @xmath101 @xmath2 km s@xmath1 , in good agreement with the observations .",
    "also , a rotation velocity of @xmath102 km s@xmath1  was measured from the spectra and the radial distance from the star to the ring of material was found to be @xmath100 cm , which is similar to @xmath103 , for a white dwarf  mass of 0.5 m@xmath104 ( keplerian motion about the white dwarf  had to be assumed in these calculations ) . at this radius",
    ", the accretion curtain is also rotating at a velocity of 2@xmath105/p@xmath106 @xmath2 km s@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath107 ergs @xmath108 s@xmath1 ( 64% - integrated over one spin cycle ) of the original line fluxes that is contained in the average - subtracted profile of h@xmath6  shows radial velocity  variations with the spin period .",
    "assuming that h@xmath4  and h@xmath5  also show a similar flux variation ( h@xmath4  and h@xmath5  spin tomograms also show a low - velocity s - wave but this result is not secured due to poor quality of data ) , the total line fluxes showing radial velocity  variations with the spin period can be estimated to be @xmath109 ergs @xmath108 s@xmath1 for the three emission lines .",
    "this is @xmath82/10 of the total disc flux @xcite , suggesting that only part of the ring corotates with the white dwarf  while the rest of the material may be involved in a near keplerian motion ( this is a rough comparison since the flux is integrated over one spin cycle for h@xmath6 , h@xmath4  and h@xmath5  in our data whereas @xcite derived their total flux values from one spectrum over the wavelength range @xmath110  ) .",
    "while some of the ring material co - rotates with the accretion curtains ( i.e. remains in the disc rather than being immediately channeled along the field lines ) , some is channeled along the field lines at @xmath2 km s@xmath1  towards the white dwarf .",
    "there is also some material that overflows the ring and attaches onto the magnetic field lines .",
    "the overflow stream hits the magnetosphere , probably causing a second bright spot on the slowly rotating magnetosphere ( figure  [ o : qexillus2b ] ) .",
    "the overflow stream is irradiated by the white dwarf  in its inner regions close to the white dwarf  ( the regions facing the white dwarf ) .",
    "this results in the hvc emission being obscured at @xmath111 , which are phases where the stream is viewed from behind - opposite the side facing the white dwarf , hiding the irradiated inner regions .",
    "hvc emission from the stream is blueshifted when that from the narrow s - wave component  shows maximum redshift .",
    "near @xmath112 the two s - waves intersect , explaining the asymmetry in the brightness of the s - wave seen near @xmath112 ( figure  [ q : habegaidltrl ] ) .",
    "the overflow stream curls nearly behind the white dwarf  and it is truncated by the field when the upper magnetic pole is facing the stream .",
    "ferrario & wickramasinghe ( 1993 ) and ferrario , wickramasinghe & king ( 1993 ) showed that in ips the accretion curtain below the orbital plane can contribute in the radial velocities of a system if it can be seen either through the central hole of the truncated disc , or from below the disc , or both .",
    "this effect will result in velocity cancellation due to nearly equal quantities of material that are blueshifted and redshifted on the accretion curtains ( ferrario , wickramasinghe & king 1993 ) .    in ex hya where the inclination is high ( 78@xmath76 ) and the disruption radius is large ( @xmath8 40 r@xmath113 , for a white dwarf  mass of 0.5 m@xmath104 ) as proposed in figure  [ o : qexillus2b ] ,",
    "it is clear that we see spin - varying emission from two opposite magnetic poles , producing a fairly symmetric structure in the spin - folded line profiles @xcite .",
    "if emission from these opposite poles is cancelling out then the sum will have a much lower velocity .",
    "this could explain the near zero and low amplitude of the radial velocity  variation at the spin period of the h@xmath4  and h@xmath5 , and h@xmath6  ( @xmath114 40 km s@xmath1 ) broad - base component , respectively ( see also @xcite and ferrario , wickramasinghe & king ( 1993 ) ) .",
    "one could take this argument further by suggesting that the spin modulation we observe in our data at velocities near @xmath2 km s@xmath1  ( figures  [ q : amplspec1 ] and [ q : amplspec3 ] ) is just the slight asymmetries between the two poles .",
    "the resulting velocity could just be a measure of the degree to which the poles cancel their velocities near @xmath92 km s@xmath1(coel hellier ; private communication ) .",
    "this , however , can not be the case for h@xmath4  and h@xmath5  since these two emission lines show motion that is consistent with that of a rotating object , suggesting that the line profiles are not dominated by the infall velocities at the two opposite accretion poles .",
    "if they were produced close to the white dwarf  then maximum rotational velocity near @xmath92 km s@xmath1  would be 2@xmath115 30 km s@xmath1 , which is much smaller than @xmath2 km s@xmath1",
    ". however , rotional velocities close to the ring are @xmath2 km s@xmath1 . for h@xmath6",
    ", however , we observe maximum blueshift  at @xmath116 , and so velocity due to cancellation anywhere between 0 and @xmath92 km s@xmath1are expected , depending on how much the two poles cancel .",
    "if both accretion curtains are still visible and symmetric at large radii ( which is possible as suggested by ferrario , wickramasinghe & king ( 1993 ) and our model ) , velocity cancellation will still result in smaller amplitudes than those of @xmath2 km s@xmath1observed in our data .",
    "this would then count against the argument above .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath6  orbital doppler tomograms show strong emission at the bright spot .",
    "if our model is correct , the field lines should also attract this h@xmath6  dominated material , which is chanelled along the field lines , as already shown above .",
    "the velocity of this material due to streaming motion near the outer ring is less than that of the h@xmath6  broad - base component close to the white dwarf , as expected .",
    "a strong constraint on our model is that the disruption radius of ex hya has been shown to be at 5 - 9@xmath79 cm @xcite which implies a white dwarf  magnetic moment of @xmath117 g @xmath118 . for our model",
    "this would imply that the accretion curtains do not extend to near the roche lobe radius .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xcite and @xcite , however , has shown that equilibrium rotation is possible if the magnetic moment in ex hya falls within the range of 10@xmath119 g @xmath118 .",
    "these are comparable to weakest field am hers below the period gap , and that ex hya could possess such magnetic moments is supported to a certain extent by the average - subtracted trailed spectra of ex hya that are reminiscent of emission lines  seen in some polars , e.g. v834 cen ( as discussed above ) , ef eri @xcite , qs tel @xcite and vv pup @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite raised the possibility that the magnetic fields in ips are buried by the material due to high accretion rates and so are not really as low as they appear .",
    "the ring structure in ex hya could imply higher accretion rates in ex hya than previously thought since the capacity of the ring of material to store matter may be low when compared to that of a classical disc , resulting in the accretion of more material than in a classical disc case .",
    "optical observations of ex hya and the analysis have suggested that large accretion curtains extending to a distance close to the l@xmath69 point exist in this system .",
    "the dfts and spin tomograms have for the first time provided evidence for corotation of the field lines with the ring material near the roche lobe .",
    "also , tomography and the phasing of the spin waves have suggested that feeding by the accretion curtains of the material from the ring ( ring - fed accretion ) takes place .",
    "these findings support the models of belle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and norton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for ex hya and the simulations done by norton et al .",
    "( 2004a ) which have shown that for systems with the parameters of ex hya , the accreting material forms a ring at the outer edge of the primary  roche lobe , from where accretion curtains funnel down to the white dwarf  surface .",
    "evidence for stream overflow accretion has been observed .",
    "the hvc caused by the overflow stream disappeared at @xmath120 due to obscuration by the stream .",
    "obscuration of the nsc at @xmath121 suggested the presence of the vem which was irradiated by the white dwarf  in its inner regions .",
    "the h@xmath6  broad - base component  shows a radial velocity variation with the spin period whereas that of h@xmath4  and h@xmath5  could not be detected .",
    "the low - amplitude velocity variations modulated at the spin period for h@xmath6  and for h@xmath4  and h@xmath5  is explained in terms of velocity cancellation effects .",
    "we have provided an explanation for the asymmetry in the intensity of the narrow s - wave component  seen in ex hya trailed spectra in the optical .",
    "the narrow s - wave component  and the hvc cross at @xmath112 , resulting in the asymmetry in brightness that we observe at these phases .",
    "the spin - folded trailed spectra are not of good quality and more data are needed to confirm these results .",
