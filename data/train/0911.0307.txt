    "the possible realization of this spin liquid ground state in pbvo@xmath7 is presently under debate.@xcite    in one dimension ( 1d ) , pure geometrical frustration due to nn exchange is impossible , but frustration by competing nn and nnn exchanges may occur in close analogy to the 2d square @xmath3-@xmath2 model .",

    "in addition , we elucidate the crucial importance of the structural distortion of the cuo@xmath0 chains in li@xmath0zrcuo@xmath1 . this distortion is responsible for a reduction of both the inter - chain coupling and the nnn exchange @xmath2 , as a consequence placing the system very close to the qcp .",

    "as the cuo@xmath1 plaquettes exhibit a localized , effective spin 1/2 , their linking and surrounding is of main importance for the formation of the magnetic ground state .",
    "a first structural analysis suggests sizable ferromagnetic nn exchanges caused by the close to 90@xmath35 cu - o - cu bond angle according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rule , provided the direct cu - cu transfer integral can be ignored.@xcite    a further structural characteristic of the @xmath34-phase is a split position for li(1 ) which is placed between the chain layers .",
    "the distance of the li(1 ) atoms from the high - symmetry position@xcite is 0.37 .",
    "while the influence of the split position of li(1 ) ( corresponding to 50% disorder within a classical picture , ignoring possible tunneling processes of li(1 ) between the two sites of the split position ) to the magnetic properties is investigated carefully , we neglect the small disorder of 3 - 5 % at the li(2 ) and cu site in our theoretical calculations as a good approximation .",
    "it is well known that in the vicinity of a qcp small changes in any parameter can be of crucial relevance for the ground state realized by the system .",
    "therefore , the above mentioned structural peculiarities of li@xmath0zrcuo@xmath8 raise the following two questions especially related to their influence on the electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "( i)how does the modeling of the li(1 ) split position influences the calculated ground state ? as there exists no standard procedure in band structure codes to treat split positions we suggest various classical ( i.e. within the adiabatic approximation ) approaches .",
    "( ii ) to which extend does the distortion of the cuo@xmath1 plaquettes influence the placement of the compound in the @xmath37 phase diagram ?",
    "therefore a fictitious structure with ideal planar chain geometry was also considered.@xcite",
    "the vicinity of li@xmath0zrcuo@xmath1 to a qcp requires a careful check of the structural description of the compound as a basis for our theoretical calculation .",
    "therefore the treatment of the li(1 ) split position might be crucial , although the different models may only exhibit subtle differences . in the following we suggest different models to handle the split position and discuss the results with respect to the influence of these model assumptions on the relevant states and related dispersions .",
    "( color online ) different structural models to treat the li(1 ) split position . from top to bottom : sym - high - symmetry position for li(1 ) , vca - both sites occupied by partial li(1 ) atoms , s1 to s3 - super - cells with different li(1 ) pattern . in s1 and s2 the li(1 ) atoms along the chains are shifted parallel while in s3 the li(1 ) atoms alter along the chain direction . s1 and s2 differ in the li(1 )",
    "inter - chain arrangement .",
    "the slight tilting of the zro@xmath8-octrahedra ( see fig .  [ structure ] ) is not depicted for the sake of simplicity ( full lines foreground , dashed lines background).,width=302 ]    \\(i ) to start from the most simplest approximation we performed electronic structure calculation for li(1 ) placed at the high - symmetry position ( see fig .",
    "[ li - models ] ( sym ) ) .",
    "\\(ii ) as an alternative structural model we carried out vca calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ li - models ] ( vca ) ) .",
    "this approach occupies both sites of the split position simultaneously by a half of a li atom .",
    "each of this modified li atoms is constructed by carrying the half number of valence electrons and a modified core to conserve charge .",
    "for the vca calculations the distance between the two sites of the split position has to be enlarged to suppress the overlap of the li valence states and ensure the convergence of the calculation.@xcite also asymmetric charge distributions between the two sites of a split position ( as e.g. 0.8 and 0.2 li ) lead to nearly identical dispersion of the relevant states as long as the total charge of one li atom per split position is conserved .",
    "however , deviations of the total charge of a split position cause sizable changes in the electronic structure .",
    "this is also the reason why the description of the li(1 ) split position by cpa fails , caused by the loss of charge balance at the split position in the later approximation .",
    "in contrast to the vca , where the total charge at each split position sums up to one li atom , the random occupation of the li(1 ) split sites in the cpa also generates cases with empty and double occupied li(1 ) sites with dramatic influence on the band structure and the total energy .",
    "\\(iii ) as both latter approaches do not touch the local symmetry , within a further model super - cells with different li(1 ) patterns have been calculated , breaking the local symmetry at the split position but suffer from long range order ( see fig .",

    "in the two upper panels the super - cells were constructed by a reduction of the space group symmetry .",
    "the li(1 ) atoms along the chains are all shifted in the same direction while the li(1 ) atoms of neighboring chains are parallel ( s1 ) or anti - parallel ( s2 ) shifted . the third super - cell ( fig .",

    "small deviations in vca calculations can be observed in the bonding region of the valence band around -5.5 and -2.0 ev ( not shown ) in comparison to the high symmetry model .",
    "these differences can be understood by the influence of the two modified li cores to the crystal potential and the corresponding shift of li - o states .    comparing the density of states and lda band structure for the anti - bonding @xmath39 states , which are relevant for the magnetic exchanges and therefore the magnetism of the system",
    ", we found only tiny differences .",
    "( i ) the vca model results in an slightly larger bandwidth compared to the other models .",
    "( ii ) the high symmetry and super - cell models nearly fit perfect .",
    "the additional bands of the s3 super - cell with an alternating li pattern can be understood due to the doubling of the primitive cell having its origin in the symmetry breaking of the li pattern .      as the different structural models for the li(1 ) split position show no significant difference in behavior for the relevant low energy states ( see fig .",

    "[ structure]b ) remains to be addressed : how much does the non - planar geometry of the chains influence the balance of the nn , nnn and inter - chain couplings and the resulting placement of the compound in the @xmath3-@xmath2 phase diagram , especially its vicinity to the qcp ? for a fictitious planar",
    "chain,@xcite changes are expected since a changed cu - o - cu bond angle ( changed by about 0.8@xmath35 ) will influence j@xmath44 and the different orientation of the anti - bonding @xmath45 `` molecular orbital '' will alter @xmath46 . since these changes are hardly predictable quantitatively from structural considerations only , we apply our mapping approach also to a fictitious compound with ideal planar cuo@xmath0 chains .    in fig .",
    "[ es_planar ] the resulting anti - bonding @xmath39 bands and the related density of states for this fictitious structure are shown . for a planar chain geometry",
    "we obtain an about 50% larger bandwidth , but a very similar shape of the bands compared with the real structure . on first glance , this suggests a scaling of the leading hopping parameters , only . our tb fit yields nearly a doubling of the hopping integrals as listed in tab .",

[ tab2 ] ) .",
    "since the fm contribution @xmath50 to @xmath51 remained small - as for the real structure - it basically scales like @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we obtain a large change in @xmath51 and consequently in the frustration ratio @xmath53 for the planar chains . in consequence ,",

    "furthermore , @xmath56li nmr and complex dielectric measurements reveal a glass - like ordering of the li(1 ) ions below @xmath57k.@xcite thus , using our super - cells simulating different types of li(1 ) order ( see fig .  [ li - models ] ) , we tackled the questions whether a tendency to a static li(1 ) order can be supported by calculations .    for the purpose of computational feasibility , we restricted ourselves to a fourfold cell ( 32 atoms).@xcite the comparison of the total energy for the different ordered li(1 ) patterns ( sym , s1 , s2 , s3 ) favors energetically the high - symmetry model ( sym ) with a single li(1 ) position .",

    "[ li_ee ] ) only slight anharmonic effects could be expected .",
    "we also investigated whether the strong coulomb repulsion on the cu site could be the reason for the discrepancy between the single li(1 ) position suggested by the calculations and the experimental split position using lda+@xmath5 .",
    "with u@xmath58 in the range from 5 - 7.5ev we do not obtain any significant changes of the position of the minimum and the slope of the curve , suggesting that the correlations at the cu site play only a minor role for a possible li(1 ) order .",
    "so far our calculations with a fixed lattice ( apart from li(1 ) ) can not support the split position , but favor the high - symmetry solution ( sym ) . the discrepancy with the experiment that observed a glass - like li(1 ) ordering below 100k , may have the following origins : ( i ) dynamic effects that violate the adiabatic approximation used in the calculations or ( ii ) a correlated li(1)-o(1 ) position without long range order that would be difficult to detect in x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "an investigation of these effects is beyond the scope of the present study but should be carried out in future since it might be crucial for the final picture of the compound .      in order to provide an independent microscopic interpretation of the exchange integrals reported above , we performed exact diagonalization studies for the commonly used five - band extended @xmath30 hubbard model for finite open cu@xmath31o@xmath32 clusters . the most reliable way to choose a reasonable parameter set by fitting various spectroscopic experiments",
    "can not be used here due to the lack of single crystals and available experimental data .",

    "this way , a direct comparison to the band structure derived results ( fic ) should be more reliable .",
    "thus , we started from an available parameter set known for the well - studied closely related sister compound li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 with planar cuo@xmath0 chains.@xcite then , only two hamiltonian parameters - the mean cu - o on - site difference @xmath59  ev ( 3.75  ev ) and @xmath60  mev ( 81  mev ) - have to be slightly lowered to obtain consistency with the band structure results for the exchange integrals @xmath3 and @xmath2 reported above . for comparison the li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 parameters are given in brackets@xcite .",

    "the title compound exhibits a charge gap of about 2.35  ev as expected for an undoped cuprate .",
    "therefore all eigenstates below that energy are spin states which can be described also reasonably well by a heisenberg hamiltonian . in case of a cu@xmath62o@xmath63 cluster we deal with 10 spin states .",
    "mapping for instance these 10 spin states onto a 1d @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath64-heisenberg model,@xcite we arrive then at @xmath65  mev , @xmath66  mev and @xmath67  mev close to the values ( fic ) given in tab .",
    "ii . notice that our mapping on larger clusters with 5 cu - sites is considered to be more accurate than the determination of @xmath3 from a cu@xmath0o@xmath1-dimer and @xmath2 from a cu@xmath0o@xmath68 pseudo - trimer , where the central cu has been removed.@xcite    in the context of the lower value of @xmath3 compared with ref .",
    "we would like to mention that from a microscopic point of view @xmath3 depends strongly on the adopted value of the direct ferromagnetic cu - o exchange parameter @xmath69 .",

    "hence , the experimentally measured saturation field of about 30  tesla ( at low temperature ) is clearly dominated by the inter - chain interaction in accord with our calculated sizable inter - chain couplings ( see sec .  [ chap_elec ] ) .    in order to stimulate optical measurements and for a further experimental check of the applied hamiltonian parameters we calculated ( see fig .  [ opt ] ) the in - chain optical conductivity for 300  k and 7  k using the technique presented in ref .  .",
    "we draw attention to the strong temperature effect near 3ev between low ( 7k ) and room temperature ( 300k ) .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the different optical response in different initial spin states .",
    "for relatively small exchange integrals @xmath3 and @xmath2 the thermal population of these spin states changes markedly in the mentioned temperature range between zero and room temperature .",
    "since the nn exchange @xmath3 ( fic ) is mostly unchanged compared to the buckled structure ( sym , vca ) , a strong temperature dependence of the optical conductivity should hold for the real compound .",
    "further investigations to settle the value of @xmath3 are highly desirable not only to get access to the hamiltonian parameters,@xcite but also to check for renormalization and creation of longer - ranged couplings due to strong enough spin - phonon interaction.@xcite the strong coupling of the exchange parameter @xmath2 to the o buckling , indicated by our band structure calculations ( see tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) , opens room for such a scenario .",
    "to summarize , applying lda and lda+@xmath5 band structure calculations as well as exact diagonalization studies of an extended @xmath30 hubbard model for large cu@xmath31o@xmath32 clusters ( n=5 ) , that were finally all mapped onto a heisenberg model , we obtain a consistent , microscopically based picture : ( i ) li@xmath0zrcuo@xmath1 can be understood as a quasi-1d chain compound with fm nn @xmath3 and afm nnn @xmath2 exchange in close vicinity to a qcp .",
    "( ii ) we find sizable inter - chain couplings that should be relevant for the magnetic ground state of the system , especially due to the vicinity of the system to a critical point where the impact of the leading exchange parameters on the ground state gets small .",
    "( iii ) calculations for a fictitious structure with planar chains indicate that the balance between @xmath3 and @xmath2 depends heavily on structural details , especially on the magnitude of the cuo@xmath0 chain buckling .",
    "( iv ) this also applies for the inter - chain coupling which is strongly increased for the fictitious planar geometry .",
    "our findings suggest that the buckling of the cuo@xmath0 chain is crucial for the vicinity to the qcp , therefore it should be possible to tune the system towards that point by chemical substitution at the zr site or by external pressure . on the other hand , it would be desirable to decrease the inter - chain coupling for which the orientation of the cuo @xmath73 orbitals is more relevant than inter - atomic distances according to our results .",
    "thus , a search for good quasi 1d systems should turn towards crystal structures where the chains are arranged in a strongly non - planar pattern .",
    "our simulations indicate that the li(1 ) split position has only a negligible direct influence on the spin system , assuming that all other atoms of the structure are fixed to their experimental position .",
    "in particular , our calculations do not support the experimental observation of a glassy - like order for li(1 ) on this split position@xcite since it yields a single li(1 ) position as most energetically favorable .",
    "however , an indirect influence of the li(1 ) position on the spin system is possible : taking into account a possible relaxation of the neighboring oxygen atom in the cuo@xmath0 chain could result in a sizable modification of the exchange parameters as shown by the strong influence of this o position on the leading exchange terms .",
    "another possible origin of the discrepancy concerning the li(1 ) position could arise from dynamic and non - adiabatic effects that are beyond the scope of the present study .",

    "besides the very small energy differences compared to the large total energy for different li(1 ) elongations from the equilibrium position , the main problem for larger cells is the rather bad convergency behavior .",
    "the bad convergency is related to the well known problem of `` charge shuffling '' between ( with respect to their charge density ) almost identical , but crystallographically formaly different atoms .",
    "similar problems occur also for @xmath2 except the fact that it is hardly affected by @xmath69 but by the much smaller value @xmath88 . in the present calculation",
    "we have therefore ignored @xmath88 as it is usually done in the literature ."
