    "in recent years polyoxometalates which are practical realization of nanomagnets have become the area of intense research because of their enormous variety of structure and fascinating magnetic properties .",
    "a particular aesthetic class is that of the ring - shaped iron(iii ) compounds denoted as molecular ferric wheels .",
    "the decanuclear wheel fe@xmath2 synthesized by lippard et .",
    "@xcite may be regarded as a prototype of this class .",
    "meanwhile synthesis of ferric wheels with 6 , 8 , 12 and 18 have also been reported @xcite .",
    "these materials have dominant anti - ferromagnetic coupling between @xmath5 spins and a singlet ground state .",
    "the magnetic properties of such nanoscopic molecules result from the interplay of superexchange interactions between the atomic spins , dipolar coupling of the local moments and on - site anisotropies arising from ligand configurations .",
    "the emergence of ferric wheels has led to a renewed interest in the properties of the heisenberg chain , especially for large spin values . in 1964 fisher used a classical treatment @xcite , in which spin quantization is absent , to study the properties of heisenberg hamiltonian and found analytical solutions for the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "numerous quantum mechanical calculations have been made for heisenberg hamiltonian , mostly for spin-1/2 chains .",
    "calculations for larger @xmath6 became more interesting after haldane s conjecture @xcite regarding the presence of an energy gap in the excitation spectrum from the ground state for integer @xmath6 chains .",
    "to fit the experimental temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility data for @xmath7 lippard et .",
    "al . adopted a classical spin treatment to obtain the value of exchange interaction parameter @xmath8 . but below 50 k this treatment fails .",
    "ferric wheels with s=5/2 , and system size of up to 8 sites have been treated exactly using irreducible tensor operator technique @xcite with the aid of point group symmetry as well as by using the invariance of spin hamiltonian with regard to interchange of spin sites @xcite .",
    "recently there have been theoretical studies to explain the low temperature magnetic susceptibility data of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of ferric wheels exhibit a step like field dependence at low temperature due to the occurrence of field induced ground state level crossing , a spectacular manifestation of quantum size effect in these nanomagnets @xcite .",
    "there have been nmr and specific heat studies of these ferric wheels to investigate the energy level structure @xcite . in appropriate parameter regime",
    "these ring systems are considered to be the candidates for the observation of macroscopic quantum phenomena , in the form of quantum coherent tunneling of the neel vector @xcite . to understand these low temperature properties of ferric wheels in detail",
    "we need to know the low lying eigenvalue spectrum for these systems .",
    "it is also of interest to compare and contrast the zero temperature density of state of s=5/2 rings with that of the exactly known s=1/2 chain . in this paper",
    "we have used spin parity together with rotational symmetry of the ferric wheels to obtain the low - lying eigenvalue spectrum for rings with 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 spin-5/2 .",
    "the dispersion spectrum reveals interesting features .",
    "there have been recent reports of solving the low - lying eigen - spectrum of @xmath7 using the density matrix renormalization group @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "ours is the first study of of ferric wheels using exact methods up to a ring size of 12 , s=5/2 iron(iii ) ions .",
    "we have also studied the quantum spin dynamics of ferric wheels in presence of an alternating field after setting up the hamiltonian matrix in the subspace of low - lying states .",
    "this hamiltonian includes multipolar spin - spin interaction terms besides a time varying magnetic field ( zeeman term ) .",
    "we have then evolved an initial state , which is taken to be the ground state with a specific value of @xmath9 ( the @xmath10-component of the total spin ) in the absence of the magnetic field , by using the time - dependent formulation of the problem in the restricted subspace .",
    "we observe a nontrivial oscillation of the magnetization whose frequency depends on the amplitude of the alternating field .",
    "this phenomena is very similar to what has been observed in case of uniaxial magnets @xcite .",
    "the full symmetry of electronic states is of central interest in quantum theory .",
    "since nonrelativistic hamiltonians @xmath11 does not depend explicitly on spin , molecular eigenstates can be labeled by the total spin @xmath6 and the appropriate irreducible representation of the point group .",
    "the model hamiltonian employed in this study is the isotropic exchange hamiltonian involving exchange interaction between nearest neighbors , @xmath12 where the exchange interaction @xmath13 takes the values dictated by experimental studies of structure and magnetic properties .",
    "for @xmath14 the @xmath15 value depends on the central alkali metal atom : for na:@xmath14 @xmath15=32.77 k whereas for li:@xmath14 @xmath15=20.83 k. in @xmath16 , @xmath7 and @xmath17 @xmath15 is 22 k,15.56 k and 31.97 k respectively @xcite .",
    "the total dimensionality of the fock space of the ferric wheel is given by @xmath18 where n is the total number of spins in the wheel and @xmath19 is the spin on each ion . in case of @xmath7 , there are 10 iron(iii ) ions with the dimensionality of the fock space 60,466,176 . in case of @xmath20 , which we have solved",
    "exactly this dimension is 2,176,782,336 .",
    "specializing to given total @xmath9 leads to hilbert space dimensionalities which are lower than the fock space dimensionality . in the case of the @xmath20 cluster",
    "the @xmath21 space has a dimensionality of about 145 million ( 144,840,476 ) .",
    "the major challenge in exact computation of the eigenvalues , and properties of these spin clusters lies in handling such large bases and the associated matrices .",
    "while the dimensions look overwhelming , the matrices that represent the operators in these spaces are rather sparse .",
    "usually , the number of nonzero elements in a row is of the order of the number of exchange constants in the hamiltonian .",
    "this sparseness of the matrices allows one to handle fairly large systems .",
    "however , in the case of spin problems , generating the bases states and using the symmetries of the problem is nontrivial .",
    "the isotropic exchange hamiltonians conserve total spin , s , besides the z - component of the total spin , @xmath22 .",
    "besides these symmetries , the geometry of the cluster also leads to spatial symmetries which can often be exploited .",
    "the simplest way of generating bases functions which conserve total spin is the vb method that employs the rumer - pauling rule @xcite .",
    "it is quite easy to generalize the rumer - pauling rules to a cluster consisting of objects with different spins to obtain states with desired total spin , s. however , setting - up the hamiltonian matrix in such a basis can be computationally intensive since the exchange operators operating on a `` legal '' vb diagram ( diagram that obeys rumer - pauling rules ) could lead to `` illegal '' vb diagrams and resolving these `` illegal '' vb diagrams into `` legal '' diagrams would present the major bottle - neck . indeed , the same difficulty is encountered when spatial symmetry operators operate on a vb function .",
    "thus , the extended vb methods are not favored whenever one wishes to apply it to a motley collection of spins or when one wishes to exploit some general spatial symmetries that may exist in the cluster @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous to partition the spaces into different total spin spaces because of the usually small energy gaps between total spin states which differ in s by unity . to avoid the difficulties involved in working with total spin eigenfunctions , we exploit parity symmetry in the systems .",
    "the parity operation involves changing the z - component of all the spins in the cluster from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "there is an associated phase factor with this operation given by @xmath25 .",
    "the isotropic exchange operator remains invariant under this operation .",
    "if this symmetry is employed in the @xmath26 subspace , the subspace is divided into `` even '' and `` odd '' parity spaces depending upon the sign of the character under the irreducible representation of the parity group .",
    "the space which corresponds to even ( odd ) total spin we call the even ( odd ) parity space .",
    "thus , employing parity allows partial spin symmetry adaptation which separates successive total spin spaces , without introducing the complications encountered in the vb bases .",
    "however , the vb method can lead to complete factorization of the spin space leading to smaller complete subspaces .    in the ferric wheels , besides spin symmetries , there also exists spatial symmetries .",
    "the topology of the exchange interaction leads to a @xmath27 point group symmetry , where n is the number of iron ions in the ring .",
    "hence , @xmath28 will have c@xmath29 , c@xmath30 , c@xmath2 and c@xmath0 symmetry respectively",
    ". it should be mentioned that among these ferric wheels only @xmath7 is strictly having a ten fold rotational symmetry , rest of them approximately have the above mentioned symmetry . for computational advantage",
    "we have assumed the rotational symmetry for all the ferric wheels .",
    "this point group appears at first site to present difficulties because the characters in the irreducible representation are in some cases complex which could lead to complex bases functions .",
    "this , however , can be avoided by recognizing that in the @xmath27 group , states with wavevectors k and -k are degenerate .",
    "we can therefore construct a linear combination of the k and -k states which is real .",
    "the symmetry representations in the @xmath27 group would then correspond to the labels @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with the characters in the @xmath33 representation given by @xmath34 under the symmetry operation @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "the parity operation commutes with the spatial symmetry operations and the full point group of the system would then correspond to the direct product of the two groups .",
    "since both parity and spatial symmetries can be easily incorporated in a constant @xmath37 basis , we do not encounter the difficulties endemic to the vb theory .",
    "the generation of the complete basis in a given hilbert space requires a simple representation of a state on the computer .",
    "this is achieved by associating with every state a unique integer . in this integer , we associate @xmath38 bits with spin @xmath39 , such that @xmath38 is the smallest integer for which @xmath40 . in the integer that represents the state of the cluster , we ensure that these @xmath38 bits do not take values which lead to the @xmath38 bit integer value exceeding @xmath41 . for each of the allowed bit states of the @xmath38 bit integer",
    ", we associate an @xmath23 value between @xmath42 . for a spin cluster of n spins , we scan all integers of bit length @xmath43 and verify if it represents a basis state with the desired @xmath22 value . in fig . 1 , we show a few basis functions with specified @xmath44 value for some typical ferric wheels along with their bit representations and the corresponding integers .",
    "generation of the bases states is usually a very fast step , computationally .",
    "generating the basis as an ordered sequence of integers that represent them also allows for rapid generation of the hamiltonian matrix elements as will be seen later .",
    "symmetrization of the basis by incorporating parity and spatial symmetries involves operation on the constant @xmath26 basis by the symmetry operators . since spatial symmetry operators permute the positions of equivalent spins , every spatial symmetry operator operating on a basis function generates another basis function .",
    "every symmetry operator can be represented by a correspondence vector whose @xmath45 entry gives the state that results from operating on the @xmath46 state by the chosen operator .",
    "this is also true for the parity operator , in the @xmath47 subspace .",
    "the first step in constructing symmetry adapted linear combinations is to represent the symmetry operators in the chosen basis as matrices . in our case ,",
    "the symmetry operators are such that symmetry operation by any operator on a basis state leads to a resultant which is a single basis state .",
    "thus all our symmetry operators can be represented as vectors ; the entry in position i gives the index of the basis function generated by symmetry operation on the basis state i. since the basis is very large , it is prohibitive to store and manipulate the full basis together with all the associated symmetry vectors . to avoid these difficulties ,",
    "we have constructed the symmetry matrices in small invariant subspaces .",
    "these invariant subspaces are obtained by sequentially choosing a state and operating on it by all the symmetry operators .",
    "this gives rise to a set of states on which we again operate by all the symmetry operators , and continue this process until no new basis states are generated .",
    "the collection of all these basis states resulting at the end of this process is the invariant subspace .",
    "we can set - up symmetry combinations of the basis states in each of the invariant subspaces independently .",
    "the symmetry combinations can now be obtained operating on each state by the group theoretic projection operator , @xmath48 on each of the basis states of the invariant subspace . here",
    "@xmath49 is the @xmath50 irreducible representation , @xmath51 is the symmetry operation of the group and @xmath52 is the character under @xmath51 in the irreducible representation @xmath49 .",
    "this process is repeated with the next basis state that has not appeared in any of the invariant subspaces already constructed .",
    "the process comes to an end when all the basis states have appeared in any one of the invariant subspaces .",
    "the resulting symmetrized basis is usually over complete in each of the invariant subspaces .",
    "the linear dependencies can be eliminated by a gram - schmidt orthonormalization procedure .",
    "however , in most cases , ensuring that a given basis function does not appear more than once in a symmetrized basis is sufficient to guarantee linear independence and weed out the linearly dependent states .",
    "a good check on the procedure is to ensure that the dimensionality of the symmetrized space in the invariant subspace agrees with that calculated from the traces of the reducible representation obtained from the matrices corresponding to the symmetry operators in the chosen invariant subspace .",
    "besides , the sum of the dimensionalities of the symmetrized spaces should correspond to the dimensionality of the unsymmetrized invariant subspace in each of these subspaces .",
    "generation of the hamiltonian matrix is rather straight forward and involves operation of the hamiltonian operator on the symmetry adapted basis .",
    "this results in the matrix @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the symmetrization matrix representing the operator @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the matrix whose elements @xmath57 are defined by @xmath58 the states \\{i } correspond to the unsymmetrized basis functions .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix in the symmetrized basis is obtained by right multiplying the matrix @xmath53 by @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting symmetric hamiltonian matrix is stored in the sparse matrix form and the matrix eigenvalue problem is solved using the davidson algorithm @xcite .",
    "computation of the properties is easily done by transforming the eigenstate in the symmetrized basis into that in the unsymmetrized basis . since the operation by any combination of spin operators on the unsymmetrized basis can be carried out , all relevant static properties in different eigenstates can be obtained in a straightforward manner .",
    "we have studied the dynamics in ferric wheels by setting up the hamiltonian matrix in the desired @xmath22 space , which in all cases is restricted to @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in each subspace",
    "we have obtained a few low - lying states using the davidson algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the spin - spin correlation functions in each of the states .",
    "using the spin - spin correlation functions , we have computed the expectation value of @xmath62 operator , from which we have identified the total spin of the state .",
    "we observe from the eigenvalue spectrum of all the ferric wheels that ground state and the first excited state are spin singlet ( s=0 ) and triplet ( s=1 ) state respectively , they belong to two different spatial symmetry subspaces .",
    "so they will not mix unless there is a perturbation which spoils the @xmath63 symmetry of the molecule .",
    "we also notice that the first ( triplet ) and the second ( quintet ) excited states again fall into different symmetry subspaces .",
    "this is true in all the ferric wheels we have studied .    to study quantum dynamics we have considered the following hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath64 here d is the quadratic anisotropy factor",
    ", @xmath65 is the land @xmath65-factors for the iron(iii ) spin respectively , and h(t ) is the time - dependent magnetic field , expressed as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the frequency at which field is ramped and @xmath68 is the amplitude of the field .",
    "we have chosen d = @xmath69 and c = @xmath70 ( in units of j ) in accordance with the experimental values for @xmath7 .",
    "we take @xmath71 .",
    "the constants @xmath72 in eq .",

    "( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "the second order anisotropy term allows transitions between states with @xmath73 .",
    "both second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) arises due to magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the exact form of the anisotropy in ferric wheel is not very well established .",
    "we have included anisotropy terms only up to second order in the spin variables .",
    "the anisotropy in the plane can be formed artificially , e.g. by means of external electric or magnetic fields , pressure or using anisotropic substrate @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) does not allow the mixing of the ( singlet ) ground state , ( triplet ) first excited state and ( quintet ) second excited state in @xmath7 because of symmetry reason already mentioned earlier . to observe spin dynamics",
    "we apply a constant magnetic field that leads to triplet being the ground state of the system .",
    "this constant shifting field plays here the role of a chemical potential and is used to provide the optimal conditions for observing the considered quantum spin dynamics .",
    "we can represent the external field as @xmath74 to study the evolution of magnetization as a function of applied oscillatory field we start from a fixed axial field amplitude ( in units of @xmath75 ) and time is increased in small time step of @xmath76 t = 0.01 ( @xmath77 ) , frequency of the field is kept constant .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the system by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath78 we assume the system to be in the state with @xmath79 at time @xmath80 .",
    "this is the initial state which is time evolved according to the equation @xmath81 the evolution is carried out by explicit diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath82 , and using the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors to evaluate the matrix of the time evolution operator @xmath83 .",
    "we set up the hamiltonian matrix for time evolution in the truncated basis of 3 states corresponding to total spin @xmath84=1 .",
    "we repeatedly carry out the the time evolution in small time steps of size @xmath85 to obtain time evolution over longer periods .",
    "we have solved the exchange hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) ) exactly using the method mentioned earlier to obtain the low - lying eigenvalue spectrum for 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 site iron(iii ) rings .",
    "we find that ground state , first , second and third excited states are respectively singlet , triplet , quintet and heptet for all ferric wheels .",
    "we notice that there is no accidental degeneracy between the energy levels belonging to different symmetry subspaces .",
    "ground state switches between a@xmath86 ( k = 0 ) and b@xmath86 ( k = @xmath87 ) subspace for even and odd value of m respectively , in n=2 m ring systems .",
    "this was also observed by mattheiss in case of a spin-1/2 chain and can be understood from marshall s sign rule .",
    "the gap between the ground state and the first excited state is shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of inverse ring size . according to haldane conjecture , the gap should extrapolate to zero . the extrapolated value , while small is still finite , suggesting that in these rings the finite size effects are still at play at the ring sizes we have studied .    using the exchange constants estimated for the different ring systems",
    ", we estimate the gap between the ground state and the first excited state to be 22.67 k , 11.81 k , and 6.88 k for @xmath88 , @xmath16 , @xmath7 respectively .",
    "our calculated values compare very well with the experimental values , which are 22.0 k , 12.1 k and 6.45 k for @xmath89 , @xmath16 and @xmath7 respectively @xcite .",
    "this agreement shows that for all practical purposes ferric wheels can safely be assumed as rings neglecting the slight deviation from the exact circular geometry .",
    "our calculated gap for and @xmath17 is 12.09 k corresponding to the exchange constants predicted from experiments .",
    "however , experimental estimate of this gap is lacking .    if we define @xmath90 to be the energy difference between the @xmath91-th excited state and the ground state , we find from fig .",
    "3 that the following relationship is satisfied for the ferric wheels , @xmath92 where e@xmath93 is the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "this indicates that the lowest spin state obeys the lande interval rule , in agreement with taft s conjecture .",
    "if we assume @xmath94 to be the inverse of the moment of inertia , then the above expression gives the rotational energy of a rigid rotor in a state with quantum number @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the spin states of ferric wheels can be viewed as the quantized states of a rigid rotor .    in fig .",
    "4 we have shown the dispersion spectrum of ferric wheels . the value of @xmath96 corresponding to a wavefunction @xmath97 can be defined as , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the translation operator which in case of a ring rotates the ring by one lattice spacing .",
    "we have used the spatial @xmath100 symmetry of the ferric wheels , which enables us to identify the value of @xmath96 easily for a specified eigenfunction .",
    "we find that , in the momentum ( @xmath96 ) sector which contains the ground state , the lowest excitation is to a quintet state .",
    "for all the other @xmath96-sectors the lowest excitation is to a triplet state .",
    "previous studies @xcite on antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg chains show that the excitation spectrum is given by @xmath101 , where @xmath96 is the wave vector of the excited states measured with respect to that of the ground state . the simple antiferromagnetic spin - wave theory based on the use of the holstein - primakoff transformation for each sublattice , leads to excitation spectrum ( @xmath84 is the magnitude of the individual spin @xmath95 ) , @xmath102 this relation",
    "is supposed to be correct for @xmath103 .",
    "we notice that the excitation spectrum for ferric wheels can be fitted to a @xmath104 kind of function .",
    "data points in @xmath96=0 or @xmath105 diverges from the above sinusoidal function .",
    "this may be a finite size effect . in the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain length excitation spectrum of ferric wheel",
    "will be similar to eq .",
    "( [ spw ] ) .",
    "we have also calculated the spin - spin correlation function ( @xmath106 ) of ferric wheels and fourier transformed it to find out the structure factor ( @xmath107 ) . in fig 5.(a - d ) we have plotted the structure factor as a function of wave vector @xmath108 for different symmetry subspaces .",
    "in all the cases @xmath107 shows a peak at @xmath109 . the ground state is a nel ordered state .",
    "it also signifies that ground state will undergo a spontaneous distortion with wave vector @xmath87 .",

    "unexpectedly the frequency @xmath112 of this sinusoidal motion does not correspond to an eigenfrequency of the system or to the period of the external field .",
    "when we change the amplitude h@xmath113 of the field , the period of the magnetization changes , which is shown in fig 6 .",

    "nonadiabatic transitions are possible whenever system becomes metastable .",
    "this resonance can be observed if two states with different magnetizations are nearly degenerate leading to large tunneling cross sections between the states resulting in oscillation of the magnetization .",
