    "two body hadronic b decays have been a hot topic for many years , since it involves the perturbative qcd calculation and factorization study .",
    "it is also important for the test of standard model , the ckm angle measurements and the search of new physics phenomena . for many years , people do calculations based on the naive factorization assumption , later proved by the soft - collinear effective theory@xcite .",
    "however , there is one kind of diagrams , the so called annihilation type diagrams , which was argued to be helicity suppressed since no one knows how to calculate . in the well developed collinear factorization",
    ", there is endpoint singularity in the calculation of these diagrams .",
    "in fact , this kind of diagrams are essential for the strong phase of direct cp asymmetry in the @xmath8 decays @xcite , which is proved to be important .",
    "furthermore , there is one kind of b decays , which contains only annihilation type diagram contributions .",
    "one of the examples is the @xmath9 decay , which is predicted in ref.@xcite and measured by the b factories later @xcite .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration measured the first pure annihilation type decays in the @xmath10 sector i.e. @xmath11 decay , which exactly confirms the perturbative qcd prediction for this decay @xcite .",
    "it is worth of mentioning that the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach is almost the only method can do the quantitative calculations of the annihilation type diagrams @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the pure annihilation type charmed decays @xmath0 and @xmath12 in the pqcd approach , which is based on the @xmath13 factorization @xcite .",
    "these decays are predicted to have a large branching ratio as @xmath14 to @xmath15 , which are measurable in the near future experiments . in the annihilation type diagrams ,",
    "both of the light quark and the heavy anti b quark in b meson annihilate into another quark anti - quark pair through the four quark operators , while another light quark pair in the final state mesons are produce by a gluon attaching to the four quark operator . since the light quark in the final states are collinear , the gluon connection them must be hard .",
    "so the hard part of the pqcd approach contains six quarks rather than four quarks .",
    "this is called six - quark effective theory or six - quark operator . in this approach ,",
    "the quarks intrinsic transverse momenta are kept to avoid the endpoint divergence .",
    "because of the additional energy scale introduced by the transverse momentum , double logarithms will appear in the qcd radiative corrections .",
    "we resum these double logarithms to give a sudakov factor , which effectively suppresses the end - point region contribution .",
    "this makes the pqcd approach more reliable and consistent .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in sec.ii , we present the formalism and perform the perturbative calculations for considered decay channels with the pqcd approach .",
    "the numerical results and phenomenological analysis are given in sec.iii .",
    "finally , sec.iv contains a short summary .",
    "the @xmath16,@xmath17 and @xmath18 decays are pure annihilation type rare decays . at the quark level , these decays are described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath19 @xcite @xmath20 , \\label{hh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are ckm matrix elements , @xmath23 denotes the light down quark d or s , and @xmath24 are wilson coefficients at the renormalization scale @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 are the four quark operators .",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the color indices , @xmath30 .",
    "conventionally , we define the combined wilson coefficients as @xmath31    in the hadronic matrix element calculation , we factorize the decay amplitude into soft(@xmath32 ) , hard(h ) , and harder ( c ) dynamics characterized by different scales @xcite , @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the conjugate variable of quark s transverse momentum @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the momentum fractions of valence quarks , and @xmath37 is the largest energy scale in function @xmath38 which is the hard part .",
    "@xmath39 are the wilson coefficients with resummation of the large logarithms @xmath40 produced by the qcd corrections of four quark operators .",
    "@xmath41 is the jet function , which is obtained by the threshold resummation and smears the end - point singularities on @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the last term , @xmath42 , is the sudakov form factor , from resummation of double logarithms , which suppresses the soft dynamics effectively and the long distance contributions in the large @xmath43 region @xcite .",
    "thus it makes the perturbative calculation of the hard part @xmath44 applicable at intermediate scale , i.e. , @xmath45 scale .",
    "the @xmath46 , meson wave functions , are nonperturbative input parameters but universal for all decay modes .",
    "the lowest order feynman diagrams of the considered decays are shown in fig.1 .",

    "\\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "for numerical analysis , we use the following input parameters : @xmath70 after numerical calculation , the branching ratios of these decays are : @xmath71    the branching ratio obtained from the analytic formulas may be sensitive to many parameters especially those in the meson wave function . for the theoretical uncertainties in our calculations , we estimated three kinds of them : the first errors in our calculations are caused by the hadronic parameters , such as the decay constants and the shape parameters in wave functions of charmed meson and the @xmath72 meson , and the decay constants of tensor mesons .",
    "the second errors are estimated from the unknown next - to - leading order qcd corrections with respect to @xmath73 and nonperturbative power corrections with respect to scales in sudakov exponents , characterized by the choice of the @xmath74 gev and the variations of the factorization scales defined in eq.[taf ] and eq.[tanf ] .",
    "the third error is from the uncertainties of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "it is easy to see that the most important theoretical uncertainty is caused by the non - perturbative hadronic parameters , which are universal and can be improved by experiments .",
    "these pure annihilation type decays considered in this work are dominant by w exchange diagram .",
    "all these decays do not have contributions from the penguin operators .",
    "since the direct cp asymmetry is caused by the interference between the contributions of tree operators and that of penguin operators , it does not appear in these modes . although the annihilation type diagrams are power suppressed in pqcd approach , the branching ratio of these considered cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa - favored decays are sizable and large enough to be measured in experiment . through the study of these pure annihilation type decay modes",
    ", we can understand the annihilation mechanism in @xmath75 physics well .",
    "it is easy to find that there are large theoretical uncertainties in any of the individual decay mode calculations .",
    "however , we can reduce the uncertainties by ratios of decay channels . for example , simple relations among these decay channels are derived from eq.([1]-[3 ] ) @xmath76 it is obvious that any significant deviation from the above relations will be a signal of new physics .",
    "we calculate the branching ratios of three pure annihilation type decays in the perturbative qcd approach .",
    "the predicted branching ratios are @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "they are sizable and large enough to be measured in forthcoming experiment .",
    "the study about the pure annihilation type decays can help us understand the annihilation mechanism in @xmath75 physics .",
    "there are no direct cp asymmetries , because these decays have no contributions from penguin operators in the standard model .",
