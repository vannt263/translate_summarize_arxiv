    "if we observe the magnetic susceptibility hump , it moves towards higher temperatures implying that the system is being driven to a more ordered state as we increase the interlayer coupling , in agreement with mermin - wagner theorem@xcite .",
    "+ the increment in magnetic susceptibilities of paramagnetically disordered state with increase in @xmath2 implies that the quantum parmagnetic ordered state tends to vanish and the spins re - order themselves as the interlayer coupling is increased .",
    "we have presented an exact diagonalization study on @xmath7 model for a @xmath4-spin layered lattice in @xmath196 geometry to examine the role of interlayer coupling on the inplane magnetic order . for a quasi-2d @xmath0 model ,",
    "the paramagnetic region is found to extend from @xmath197 to @xmath198 .",
    "as we increase the interlayer coupling , the value of spin - gap in the paramagnetic region reduces since the interlayer coupling stabilizes the inplane order and thereby lowers the degree of disorder in paramagnetic regime .",
    "we further observe that the spin - gap _ vs _ @xmath93 curves coincide for @xmath169 and @xmath199 , implying that , @xmath200 is the saturation value of the interlayer coupling beyond which the spin gap does not change with @xmath85 . for an multilayered lattice @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding saturation value will be @xmath97 , half the value for our two layered lattice , after correcting for double counting .",
    "+ at zero temperature , for small values of interlayer coupling , the inplane first - neighbor ssc becomes maximum in paramagnetic region _",
    "i.e. _ short range order is dominant in paramagnetic regime .",
    "as the interlayer coupling is increased , the inplane first - neighbor ssc reduces _",
    "i.e. _ short range correlation decreases in quantum paramegnetic regime .",
    "this is corroborated by our results on static spin structure factor also . in the quantum paramagnetic regime , @xmath118 corresponding to nel order decreases and @xmath127 corresponding to collinear order increases slowly with @xmath93 when @xmath85 is small .",
    "however , when @xmath85 is increased to @xmath186 , the change in @xmath118 and @xmath127 becomes steeper indicating that in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath118 may crossover directly to @xmath127 and the intervening quantum paramagnetic regime disappears .",
    "+ we observe that the specific heat _",
    "vs _ temperature curve is flat in ordered states like nel or collinear state but as the system enters quantum paramagnetically disordered state , the specific heat _",
    "vs _ temperature curve acquires a sharp peak . for small values of interlayer coupling , we observe a sharp peak in specific heat _ vs _ temperature curve for the inplane frustration parameter interval @xmath201 corresponding to paramagnetically disordered state",
    ". however , as the interlayer coupling is increased to a significant value , say @xmath169 , a sharp peak in specific heat _",
    "vs _ temperature curve is observed in the narrowed interval @xmath202 , indicating the shrinking of quantum paramagmetically disordered regime on @xmath93 scale .",
    "+ from the ( z - component of ) magnetic susceptibility _ vs _ temperature plot we observe that the value of magnetic susceptibility in ordered states like nel or collinear state is higher compared to its value in quantum paramagnetically disordered state . in the paramagnetically disordered state corresponding to the inplane frustration parameter interval @xmath203 for small values of interlayer coupling @xmath85 ,",
    "the peak height of magnetic susceptibility curve is small .",
    "as @xmath85 is increased , the height of the magnetic susceptibility peak increases in the above interval of inplane frustration parameter , implying that the interlayer coupling drives the system to an ordered state .",
    "+ in summary , the results presented in preceding sections show that for small values of interlayer coupling @xmath85 , the system is in ( a ) semi - classical nel ordered state for @xmath204 ( b ) semi - classical collinear ordered state for @xmath103 and ( c ) quantum paramagnetically disordered state for @xmath205 . as @xmath85",
    "is increased @xcite , the interval of quantum paramagnetic disordered state on @xmath93 scale , narrows and long range order sets in .",
    "it has earlier been reported @xcite that for a multilayered lattice with @xmath97 , the paramagnetically disordered state vanishes and as @xmath93 is increased , the system goes directly from semi - classical nel order to semi - classical collinear order . in our study on finite lattice , on increasing @xmath85 ,",
    "the intervening paramagnetically disordered regime narrows on @xmath93 scale but does not vanish due to finite size effect . + * acknowledgement : * mmh and maha acknowledge financial support from university grants commission vide f. no .",
