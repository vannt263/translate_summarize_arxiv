    "a quantitative analysis of the estimation precision of an experiment relies strongly on the kind of measurement performed on the system .",
    "apart from the dependence of the different outcome probabilities on the quantum state via born s rule , we must take into account the backaction of each measurement on the state of the system , as this governs the subsequent evolution and thus affects future outcome probabilities . in the case of counting of photons emitted from an atomic system ,",
    "the detection of a photon at a random time is accompanied by a quantum jump where the atom is reset to its ground state , and the time intervals between emission events are thus governed by the ( same ) transient excited state probability function . unlike the mean fluorescence intensity , which is given by the steady state excitation of the atom and saturates for strong driving , the transient evolution shows oscillations at the driving rabi frequency , and hence the counting measurements and , notably , their backaction , lead to better resolution of large rabi frequencies and other interaction parameters @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the alternative situation of continuous homodyne detection of the field emitted by a quantum system , see  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "it is theoretically interesting to study the achievements of homodyne detection for precision measurements as the character of the signal and the measurement backaction is very different from that of photon counting .",
    "such a study is further motivated by the extensive use of homodyne detection in optics where it often offers high efficiency and practical advantages over photon counting and in probing of microwave fields , e.g. , in circuit qed @xcite , where photon counters are not available .    in sec .",

    "eq:1 , remains pure , this is not the case when @xmath172 .",
    "this is a consequence of our inability to trace the state exactly when some photo emission events are missed by the detectors , and inevitably leads to a decreased information in the signal .",

    "eq : etascaling , the information in the signal is fully contained in the lowest order temporal correlations , i.e. for low @xmath17 we expect @xmath176 . as seen in  [ fig : fishereta ] , where we compare @xmath177 to the fisher information of the full homodyne current eq .",
    "eq : fi for different values of @xmath17 as a function of the rabi frequency , this is indeed the case . in particular , for realistic detection efficiency @xmath178 the full information is largely contained in the lowest order time - correlations of the signal , and with low efficiency detection @xmath179 higher order correlations hold only negligible information as seen by the light blue data in the figure .",
    "we have calculated the classical fisher information for homodyne detection of the radiative emission from a resonantly driven two - level system and demonstrated that a bayesian signal analysis reaches the corresponding cramr - rao sensitivity bound on the applied rabi drive strength .",
    "the classical fisher information of homodyne detection is upper bounded by the quantum fisher information associated with the quantum state of the ( unmeasured ) field emitted by the system , and lower bounded by the information retrieved by the mean value of the homodyne signal .",
    "the emitter system is subject to measurement backaction due to the noisy measurement data , and the signal thus acquires non - trivial temporal correlations , which are at the heart of the performance of the bayesian analysis . in the case of photon counting ,",
    "the waiting time distribution between subsequent detection events , and hence the two - time intensity - intensity correlation function accounts for the full data record , and suffices to compute the fisher information and explain its dependence on the physical parameters . here",
    "we have investigated the information contained within the two - time correlation function or , equivalently , the power spectrum of the homodyne detection current . due to the weaker measurement backaction , homodyne detection outcomes may be correlated for a larger number of different measurement times and , in particular for strong driving , we have observed that most of the information about the rabi frequency is hidden in multi - time correlations in the current and can be retrieved efficiently only by the bayesian analysis .",
    "our methods of analysis are general and apply to detection of signals from any quantum system and for the estimation of any physical parameter governing the evolution of that system .",
    "there have been theories suggesting that a sufficiently weak measurement back action might lead to an asymptotic resolution scaling better than @xmath4 @xcite , and that more complex systems will offer similar improvement @xcite .",
    "our two - level example system does not offer long memory times and , despite the weak homodyne probing , it is subject to the ergodicity arguments given in sec .",
    "i , implying a @xmath4 scaling of sensitivity .",
