    "ultracold polar molecules have been of great interest for many years .",
    "they have many applications with quantum logic operations , many - body effects , and collision studies at extremely low energies  @xcite . due to the permanent electric dipole moment of these molecules in their rovibrational ground state ,",
    "the long - range anisotropic interaction between neighbors allows a range of unique physical interactions  @xcite that are inaccessible to ultracold atomic systems .",
    "the most recent addition to the bi - alkali family of ultracold molecules is @xmath3li-@xmath4rb  @xcite .",
    "recent work on this system has revealed a high rate of photoassociation ( pa )  @xcite and a pathway for direct generation of ground ro - vibronic molecules through pa and spontaneous decay  @xcite .",
    "much of this work makes use of a resonantly coupled @xmath9 state for pa  @xcite .",
    "we have also observed short - range pa through the @xmath10 states , leading to population in the low - lying vibrational levels of the metastable @xmath11 state  @xcite .    in order to achieve many of the goals for ultracold polar molecules , it is essential to generate and confine a large number of molecules . for generation , trapping , and control of the molecules , we must explore the various electronic potentials , with special interest in singlet - triplet mixed states that can be useful in transferring population from triplet to singlet states ( or vice versa ) . in the present work ,",
    "we explore the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 states , all previously unexplored in lirb . for each of these potentials",
    "we determine the term energies and vibrational constants . with the exploration of the levels discussed in the present work ,",
    "only one low - lying electronic state has not yet been studied , the @xmath15 state . in table",
    "[ tab : statesobserved ] we list the eleven lowest energy states of the lirb system and the vibrational levels that have been observed for each .",
    ".list of low - lying states of lirb that have been observed experimentally .",
    "ranges of vibrational quantum numbers marked with an asterisk are not inclusive .",
    "weakly - bound vibrational levels of many of these potentials used for photoassociation of ultracold lirb molecules are not included . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section , we analyze state mixing between several vibrational levels of the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 states .",
    "the two largest perturbations seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vibspacing](a ) are due to mixing between the @xmath16 level with @xmath17 , and between the @xmath18 level with @xmath19 .",
    "the mixing between states is proportional to  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hamiltonian for the spin - orbit interaction , and @xmath22 is the energy difference between the unperturbed states .",
    "the vibrational factor of the wavefunctions @xmath23 in this expression implies that strong state mixing requires large franck condon overlap between two states , while the energy denominator requires small energy difference . in fig .",
    "[ fig : statemixingbig ] , we show a rough estimate for the interaction strength caused by the spin - orbit effect divided by the state energy difference between the @xmath24 5 , 8 and 11 states with the various vibrational levels @xmath25 of the @xmath2 state .",
    "we estimate the interaction strength with  @xcite @xmath26/2 where @xmath27 is the spin - orbit interaction in atomic rubidium , 250 @xmath28 ; we have found that this approximation roughly holds in the past  @xcite . for @xmath16 and 5 , mixing with one state is much stronger than any of the rest , justifying a two - state mixing model .",
    "the @xmath29 state is hardly perturbed because it has a very small franck condon overlap with @xmath30 despite having nearly identical energies .",
    "this is consistent with the story told by fig .",
    "[ fig : vibspacing ] , as neither @xmath29 nor @xmath30 appear significantly perturbed . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : vibspacing](b ) shows that @xmath31 is slightly perturbed , by @xmath32 and 11 , which matches the small interaction strength shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : statemixingbig](d ) .    for the @xmath16 and 5 , which we approximate as a simple two - state mixing model , we calculated the admixture coefficients . using the treatment of mixed states in ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the mixed states as @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the bare states .",
    "the energies of states @xmath37 and @xmath38 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "as we have done in the past  @xcite , we can use the expected energy and observed energy of mixed states to estimate their mixing ; we use the molecular constants of table  [ tab : molecularconstants ] to predict where the unperturbed state should lie .",
    "after we have a prediction for the unperturbed state location we can solve for the admixture coefficients @xmath41   \\label{eq : c}\\ ] ] and @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{eq : d}\\ ] ] additionally , we calculate the interaction strength , v@xmath43 , using v@xmath44 from ref .",
    "all of the relevant parameters for the strongest mixed @xmath45 states that we observe and the derived admixture coefficients and interaction strengths are presented in table  [ tab : fixingassignments ] . for both of these states",
    ", @xmath46fcf is within a factor of two of @xmath47 , showing approximate agreement with the model of ref .",
    "these mixed states are critical for some future experiments , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we performed spectroscopy on three electronic states in lirb : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , with the intention of using the data presented here to guide future work .",
    "\\1 ) in future work , we plan to explore the @xmath48 as an intermediate state for stirap to transfer population from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "pa to the @xmath51 mixed state produces @xmath49 molecules at a rate of @xmath52 molecules / second . for future applications , which we want to transfer these molecules to @xmath50 .",
    "we observed vibrational levels @xmath53 , 9 , 12 , 13 and 26 - 45 , and saw very regular vibrational spacing .",
    "this is reflected in our harmonic constant , @xmath54 , which has an uncertainty of only 0.9 @xmath28 .",
    "such uncertainty combined with depletion spectra should allow us to find @xmath48 easily .",
    "\\2 ) we are interested in studying @xmath55 ; as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , these states could be used to laser - cool ground state lirb molecules . in the present experiment",
    ", we exploited the strong mixing in the @xmath45 complex and we were able to observe @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , finding more deeply bound vibrational levels will be challenging .",
    "we noticed that the amount of mixing between @xmath45 states dictates the strength of the @xmath2 state depletion resonance , and we expect the mixing to decrease as the states get more deeply bound .",
    "further , the @xmath57 transition had a linewidth of only 1 ghz at full depletion power ( compare with @xmath58 transition which was well over 100 ghz in linewidth ) , which makes this a daunting search",
    ". however , we expect our molecular constants and those of refs  @xcite and @xcite to be a helpful guides .",
    "\\3 ) our data on mixing between @xmath59 and @xmath19 suggests that this state pair is at a nearly 50 - 50 admixture .",
    "this pair of states combine many features that lead us to believe they may be useful in direct short range pa . the @xmath59 state has large fcf overlap with the ro - vibronic ground state , and the inner turning point of @xmath19 nearly lines up with the outer turning point of the triplet scattering state .",
    "this is a good indicator of states that have potential for use in short range pa  @xcite .",
    "finally , the wavelength for pa to this state is 1562 nm which can be accessed with commercial fiber amplifiers .",
    "this is important because we will have watts of pa power available which will help overcome the weak pa rates common to most short range pa experiments . in total ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath19 may be nearly ideal candidates for producing ro - vibronic ground state molecules by short range pa .",
    "as a rough estimate this could produce up to @xmath60 ro - vibronic ground state molecules / second  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we used molecules produced by pa to a @xmath9 state to study interesting bound states in lirb .",
    "we used re2pi to map out the top 20 vibrational levels and four lower vibrational levels of the @xmath0 state .",
    "we used depletion spectroscopy to study the 30 most deeply bound @xmath1 vibrational levels and discovered that the @xmath45 mixing is quite strong in this region .",
    "we capitalized on the @xmath45 mixing to study @xmath56 .",
    "this data will guide our future work in both stirap and laser cooling lirb molecules .",
    "we are happy to acknowledge useful conversations with and help in calculating the short range pa rate from jess prez - ros ; advice on assembling the depletion laser provided by george toh ; conversations with sourav dutta that sent us down the @xmath0 spectroscopy path ; and university support of this work through the purdue ovpr amo incentive grant ."
