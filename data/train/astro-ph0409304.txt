    "gravitational lensing has been a unique tool to probe the intervening matter distribution between the observer and source objects without any assumption about the dynamical phase of deflectors .",
    "the most impressive and beautiful images of giant arcs can appear when the light from background sources passes near the caustic of a foreground lens .",
    "these `` strong lensing '' features indicate the presence of a critical ( or higher ) surface mass density in the inner region and are particularly useful for constraining the core structure of the lensing cluster . in the `` weak lensing '' regime where the distortion becomes weaker and less obvious",
    "( whether the cluster is less massive or projected distances of source galaxies are farther from the cluster center ) , one can still detect coherent alignments of background galaxies and restore the mass distribution up to far greater radii from these subtle measurements . since the first successful detection of systematic alignments of background galaxies by @xcite ,",
    "the technique has been applied to a wide selection of galaxy clusters and is now firmly established as one of the most straightforward paths to probe the mass distribution of the cluster in question .    in general , the detectability of weak gravitational shears depends not only upon the intrinsic signal strength determined by the projected mass density of a lens and the geometry between lens and source , but also upon the observational restrictions set by finite sensitivity and resolution of an instrument . in this regard , a weak lensing analysis of high - redshift clusters",
    "is disadvantaged because the signal decreases as the redshift of the lensing cluster approaches that of background galaxies , and also it becomes harder to recover shapes of faint , poorly resolved galaxies , which however contain most of the useful signal .",
    "nevertheless , the demands for comprehensive studies on many individual high - redshift clusters are increasing because of their potentially significant implications for cluster formation and cosmology .",
    "for example , even the mere abundance of massive clusters at such high redshifts can strongly constrain the cosmological density parameter @xmath12 , decoupling the @xmath13 degeneracy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . furthermore , most high - redshift clusters possess filamentary structures indicating their early stage of formation , and it is interesting to investigate in detail how dark matter is distributed with respect to cluster galaxies or the intracluster medium ( icm ) traced by x - ray emission .",
    "the remarkable substructure of ms 1054 - 03 obtained through the weak lensing analysis of wfpc2 observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hfk00 ) demonstrated the undeniable merits of space - based weak lensing observations and already hinted at the bright prospects of the newly installed advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in this application .",
    "the advantages of hst observations over ground - based imaging include a higher number density of background galaxies whose shapes can be reliably determined , and smaller corrections for point spread function ( psf ) effects .",
    "the pixel size of the wide field channel of acs is @xmath140.05 @xmath15 , offering twice the sampling resolution of the wide field ( wf ) chips of wfpc2 .",
    "in addition , acs has a factor of 5 improvement in throughput while providing twice the field of view of wfpc2 .",
    "therefore , the finer resolution , higher sensitivity , and wider field of view of acs can provide a much higher fraction of well - resolved galaxies with less investment of hst observing time .    in this paper , we present a weak lensing study of the x - ray selected high - redshift ( z@xmath140.84 ) cluster cl 0152 - 1357 using the wide field channel of acs .",
    "together with ms 1054 - 03 , cl 0152 - 1357 is one of the most x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath16 known to date whose x - ray properties have been well - studied by the rosat @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , and @xmath3 observatory @xcite . nevertheless , unlike ms 1054 - 03 ,",
    "there have been no hst - based high - resolution weak lensing studies so far .",
    "such studies , combined with x - ray observations , can substantially enhance our understanding of the dynamical evolution of the icm and its interaction with cluster galaxies as well as of the cluster substructure as a whole .",
    "particularly , cl 0152 - 1357 is known to have a complicated x - ray and optical substructure , and the high - resolution mass reconstruction from the acs weak lensing is expected to provide the mass distribution of the cluster in unprecedented detail .",
    "we organize our works as follows . in [ obs ] , we describe the observations and basic data reduction .",
    "ellipticity measurement of source galaxies is presented in [ elle ] . in [ psf ]",
    "we discuss the psf modeling and correction .",
    "[ lum ] describes the luminosity of the cluster and the distribution thereof .",
    "the mass reconstruction of the cluster is handled in [ massrecon_section ] and the total mass estimates from various approaches are described in [ massest ] .",
    "finally , the substructure from this study is compared with that of other studies in [ substructure ] before the conclusion [ conclusion ] . throughout the work we assume @xmath18 cdm cosmology favored by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) with @xmath6 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "cl 0152 - 1357 was observed in a 2@xmath212 mosaic pattern allowing @xmath22 overlap between pointings with the wide field channel of acs during 2002 november and 2002 december ( gto proposal 9290 , p.i .",
    "the cluster was imaged in f625w , f775w , and f850lp ( hereafter @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ) with integrated exposure per pointing @xmath25 s. the low level ccd processing ( e.g. overscan , bias , dark subtraction , and flat - fielding ) was done with the standard stsci calacs pipeline , and the final high - level science images were created through the `` apsis '' acs gto pipeline @xcite . the resulting high accuracy in both the image registration and the geometric distortion correction is indispensable in weak lensing measurements .",
    "the apsis pipeline calculates offsets and rotations between images using the `` match '' program @xcite after applying a geometric distortion model @xcite to the astronomical objects which have a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the typical shift uncertainty is @xmath14 0.015 pixels ( j. blakeslee 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the drizzle - blot - drizzle cycle of apsis automatically rejects cosmic rays and generates mosaic science images .",
    "we used the lanczos3 drizzling kernel , which gives a sharper psf and less noise correlation between neighboring pixels .",
    "the noise correlation decreases the root mean square ( rms ) noise fluctuations and therefore causes photometric errors to be slightly underestimated .",
    "apsis calculates the correct rms noise in the absence of correlation .",
    "the rms map produced in this way is used for source detection and photometric error estimation .",
    "we present the color composite image of the cluster center in figure  [ fig1 ] , which shows many strong - lensing features such as arc(let)s around the two central brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "the objects were detected using sextractor @xcite on the detection image created by combining all the present filter images after applying inverse variance weighting . in general , many parameters in sextractor affect the detection procedure , and we adopted the values obtained from the experiments of @xcite .",
    "they tried to suppress spurious detections while extracting all obvious galaxies by tuning up these parameters .",
    "we found that their rather conservative choice of detect_minarea=5 and detect_thresh=1.5 selects faint galaxies up to the detection limit ( s /",
    "n @xmath14 3 ) without significantly introducing false objects into the object catalog .",
    "we ran sextractor in dual image mode for each filter to obtain the galaxy photometry and colors .",
    "the final catalogs were visually compared with the image in order to remove false detections ( e.g. diffraction spikes and spurious spots around bright stars , saturated ccd bleeding , noise fluctuation at image edges , clipped and merged galaxies , hii regions inside nearby galaxies , etc . ) .",
    "this resulted in a total of 10992 objects .",
    "the number count plot in figure  [ fig2 ] shows the completeness of our data down to @xmath1427.5 magnitude in all three passbands .",
    "in the regime where the background galaxy is much smaller than the scale length of the gravitational potential variation , we can obtain the linearized lens mapping equation as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transformation matrix @xmath28 which relates a position @xmath29 in source plane to a position @xmath30 in image plane , and @xmath31 is the 2-dimensional lensing potential . in the matrix of equation  [ equ_lens ] , the convergence @xmath32 determines the overall magnification , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 describe the shear along x - axis and at @xmath35 from the x - axis , respectively .",
    "therefore , in general , the galaxy images are distorted in shape ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and size ( @xmath32 ) ( in a strict sense , @xmath36 also alters the object size anisotropically ) .",
    "though @xcite claimed that the magnification bias ( and thus the number density bias ) can be used to estimate the local surface mass density directly , most weak lensing works have been based on the ellipticity biases .",
    "this is because the magnification effect is more sensitive to shot noise , and the snr of the shear measurement is considerably better than that of the magnification effect in a typical weak lensing ( @xmath37 ) regime @xcite .",
    "the ellipticity of an object can be defined in terms of weighted quadrupole moments as follows : @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the pixel intensity , and @xmath41 is the weight function required to suppress the noise in the outer region of the object .",
    "* hereafter ksb ) used the circular gaussian weight whose size matches that of the object , thus maximizing the significance of the measurement",
    ". however , the circular weight makes the object rounder , and the effect becomes severe for highly non - circular galaxies .",
    "besides , the ellipticities calculated in this way do not follow the simple ellipticity transformation rule @xcite in response to the applied shear .",
    "these features necessitate the introduction of an additional parameter which in general depends on the higher moments . in ksb work , this quantity is referred to as `` shear polarizability '' @xmath42 .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bj02 ) introduced adaptive moments using an elliptical weight function whose shape and size match those of an object .",
    "while the concept of finding the optimal elliptical gaussian weight function is mathematically simple , the actual implementation can take various forms .",
    "for example , one can determine the weight function by minimizing the deviation from the image in the least - square sense .",
    "alternatively , one can start with a circular weight function and iteratively modify the ellipticity , the size , and the centroid of the weight function until these parameters converge .",
    "bj02 effected the determination of optimal elliptical weight function by iteratively shearing the objects to match the @xmath43 gaussian weight . considering the finite pixelization of object images , this may not sound more attractive than the previous two schemes .",
    "however , if the galaxy images can be decomposed via mathematically well - behaved basis functions , the adaptive elliptical moments are computed inexpensively .",
    "bj02 proposed the polar eigenfunctions of 2-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) as basis functions .",
    "this decomposition was also independently suggested by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter r03 ) though his shear estimator is different from that of bj02 .",
    "many mathematically convenient formalisms developed for these eigenfunctions or @xmath44 include operators which can effect coordinate transformations such as shear , translation , dilation , rotation , etc .",
    "even more important advantages one obtains from the galaxy expansion using shapelets are that the psf can be compactly described by the coefficients of the basis functions and the ( de)convolution is easily achieved by simple matrix manipulations .    shapelets in polar coordinate are given by    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "the complex conjugate relation @xmath48 is used to compute the eigenfunctions when @xmath49 .",
    "other useful mathematical properties of the above basis functions along with recursion relations of matrix elements of the aforementioned operators are presented in bj02 .",
    "once the galaxy image is decomposed into @xmath50 vectors , we can translate , dilate , and shear    @xmath51    until the series of transformation satisfies the following conditions    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    the condition imposed by equations  [ eqn_cen ] , [ eqn_sig ] , and [ eqn_ell ] relate to centroid , size , and ellipticity of the optimal elliptical gaussian , respectively . in this paper ,",
    "the algorithm of bj02 method is independently implemented in the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2.5 ] demonstrates the statistics of the decomposition of galaxies in @xmath55 passband .",
    "the fraction of reliably measurable galaxies decreases substantially if target galaxies are fainter than @xmath56 .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the other two passbands .",
    "the final shape catalog is produced after optimally combining ellipticities in all three passbands .",
    "one must note that the quantity @xmath57 in equation  [ eta ] is different from the conventional definitions of ellipticities though they are related in a straightforward manner .",
    "@xmath58    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the axis ratio @xmath61 . in this paper , the @xmath62 @xmath63 in equation  [ eqn_delta ]",
    "is referred to as ellipticity unless indicated otherwise .",
    "as one probes to weaker and weaker lensing regimes , the accurate removal of any instrumental artifact becomes paramount to the success of the analysis .",
    "finite seeing causes the cicularization of small galaxies while the anisotropy of the psf can create systematic biases in the size and the direction of the polarization .",
    "the pioneering investigation of ksb95 suggested that an approximation can be made by treating the real psf as a small perturbation to an isotropic psf .",
    "the original prescription and its variations have been employed widely during the last decade though the valid regime of its application was frequently questioned .",
    "@xcite argued that despite the fact that the modified ksb works reasonably in some cases , the technique may become problematic in diffraction - limited observations . in the current investigation , among many recent suggestions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we settled upon the moment - based deconvolution technique ( bj02 ; r03 ) which performs the deconvolution by the matrix manipulation of shapelet components of the galaxy and psf . the decomposition of the psf in this way not only eases the modeling of the psf variation across the field , but also effectively suppresses the noise amplication if the truncation of the higher order moments is carefully handled .",
    "though field - dependent variation of the wfc psf is small compared to that of wfpc2 , its change in ellipticity within the field is significant @xcite . in order to investigate the issue we retrieved the repeated ( @xmath14 every three weeks ) observations of the modestly crowded region of the globular cluster 47 tuc originally used to monitor the flat - fielding stability of acs ( prop 9656 , pi de marchi ) .",
    "because the default drizzling kernel of the stsci pipeline is square , we had to re - drizzle all the flat - fielded ( flt ) images using lanzcos3 kernel to match the psf size of the cl 0152 - 1357 observation .",
    "after the initial detection of stars by sextractor , we selected `` good '' stars which are bright , unsaturated , and isolated ( having no companion stars or cosmic - rays within 15 pixels from the center ) .",
    "then , each star is decomposed into shapelet components by minimizing the following :    @xmath64    where the optimal centroid and size of the eigenfunctions @xmath65 are iteratively determined .",
    "the two whisker plots in figure  [ fig3 ] show typical psf patterns of the wfc measured from the 47 tuc field .",
    "@xcite pointed out the magnitude of ellipticity is determined by the focus offset , and the angle of elongation switches by 90@xmath66 when the sign of the offset becomes opposite .",
    "this fact is confirmed by comparing figure  [ fig3]a and  [ fig3]b which are taken on 2002 october 3 and 2002 october 24 , respectively , roughly on the same patch of the 47 tuc field .",
    "we find that acs psf patterns at other epochs follow one of these two patterns with slightly altered ellipticities .",
    "the spatial variation of shapelet coefficients @xmath50 of acs psfs is modeled as    @xmath67    we found the third order in @xmath68 ( i.e. @xmath69 ) is sufficient to describe the pattern and higher order polynomials do not improve the agreement between the model and the data .",
    "now , the important question is how well the psf taken from the 47 tuc field can describe the psf on the cl 0152 - 1357 field . since the ellipticity of the psf changes with respect to the focus offset , it is necessary that the ellipticity of the model psf is made adjustable to match that of the actual psf in the cluster observation .",
    "we implemented this by applying a shear operator to the shapelet components of the model psf .",
    "that is ,    @xmath70    where the evaluation of matrix elements of the shear operator @xmath71 can be found in appendix a.3 of bj02 .",
    "though @xmath72 can be also allowed to vary depending on the position in principle , we found that a simple fixed parameter per exposure nicely reduce the systematic residuals .",
    "because we measure galaxy shapes on the @xmath73 mosaic image , another slight complexity arises due to the overlap between pointings .",
    "nevertheless , a reasonable assumption can be made that the psf in the overlapping region is very closely approximated as an exposure - time - weighted average of all the contributing psfs .    using a typical half - light radius versus magnitude plot , we initially selected 73 isolated , bright stars which can be used as local psf indicators .",
    "we removed stars having any noticeable defects from the list by visual inspection , which ended up a total of 62 stars .",
    "figure  [ fig4]a shows the polarization pattern in cl 0152 - 1357 observation measured from these stars . then , using our model psf we constructed `` rounding kernels '' @xcite which circularize the originally elongated psfs and applied them to the cl 0152 - 1357 images . comparing the ellipticities before ( figure  [ fig4]a ) and after ( figure  [ fig4]b ) the application of the rounding kernel verifies that our model psf closely represents the real psfs on the cluster image ( see also figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it appears that there still remain tiny but systematic residuals due to the incompleteness of the model ; however , their effects on the cluster mass analysis are estimated to be negligible .",
    "though the `` rounded images '' obtained in the previous section can be used to measure the object shapes , this is not preferred to the straightforward deconvolution technique because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the rounding kernel always degrades the original image seeing because the kernel size must be comparable to the instrument psf size in order to remove the anisotropy sufficiently , which in particular is detrimental to very small galaxy images .",
    "second , the dilution ( circularization ) correction provided by bj02 is still an approximation and @xcite showed in their simulation that indeed the prescription by bj02 is not accurate if the kurtosis of the psf is not small or the galaxy is not well - resolved .    due to the simple transformation rule of the gaussian functions",
    ", the deconvolution can be effected by convenient matrix manipulations : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are shapelet components of the convolved image , the pre - seeing image , and the psf , respectively .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix elements @xmath78 is summarized in bj02 ( see also r03 for cartesian coordinates ) . after contracting @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    ", we get @xmath80 now @xmath81 can be inverted to compute the deconvolved image @xmath82 from the psf - convolved original image @xmath83 . because we desire to make the matrix @xmath84 invertible and also minimize the noise amplification which is typical in every deconvolution problem , the expansion of the psf in shapelets must be truncated appropriately and the characteristic size of the object should be large enough compared to the size of the psf .",
    "we base our selection of cluster members on the tight color - magnitude ( cm ) relation of early - type galaxies of the cluster .",
    "because the 4000  break of the cluster ellipticals is redshifted to the cutoff wavelength of @xmath55 filter , @xmath85 colors are better suited than @xmath86 colors .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig5.2 ] , the bright cluster red sequence of cl 0152 - 1357 occupies a relatively narrow strip in the @xmath85 versus @xmath24 cm diagram . because increasing photometric errors at faint magnitudes cause the distinction to become less apparent , we selected 371 galaxies brighter than @xmath87 .",
    "the spectroscopic catalog from vlt observations ( r. demarco et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) is used to reject bright non - cluster members ( @xmath88 ) and to include some known blue cluster galaxies .",
    "we show the smoothed cluster light distribution from these member galaxies in figure  [ fig5.8 ] .",
    "the spectroscopic survey of the cl 0152 - 1357 field serendipitously discovered a foreground @xmath89 group of @xmath90 galaxies rather loosely scattered over the entire field .",
    "we excluded these galaxies in the above light distribution .",
    "the vertically elongated main structure as well as the less luminous but distinct clumps around the main body is clearly visible .",
    "we refer to the brightest concentration in the light distribution as the @xmath91  @xmath92 hereafter .",
    "this smoothed light distribution will be compared with those of the @xmath3 x - ray and the weak lensing mass in [ substructure ] .    in order to estimate the rest - frame luminosity of the cluster , we proceed as follows . from the dust maps of @xcite",
    ", we obtained e(b - v)=0.014 and determined the extinction corrections for @xmath93 and @xmath24 to be 0.028 and 0.020 , respectively .",
    "then , synthetic photometry is performed by combining the latest acs throughput curves ( m. sirianni et al . 2004 , in preparation ) and the kinney - calzetti spectral templates @xcite so as to establish the photometric transformation of @xmath93 at @xmath0 to the rest frame b magnitude .",
    "the linear best - fit result has the following form .",
    "@xmath94 where dm is the distance modulus of 43.63 in this cosmology and the uncertainties of the coefficients are estimated assuming an accuracy of @xmath142% in the synthetic photometry .",
    "the total luminosty of the cluster is estimated by    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the absolute b magnitude of the sun .",
    "however , the @xmath97 obtained in this way does not include the contribution from the faint ( @xmath98 ) population .",
    "in addition , we expect the blue cluster members also comprise a significant fraction of the total light because cl 0152 - 1357 is a high - redshift cluster .",
    "we choose to adopt the scheme by hfk00 in order to correct the total luminosity of the cluster for these factors . by fitting the schechter luminosity function to our sample galaxies",
    ", we found @xmath99% of the total light must be added in order to account for the faint population . to estimate the fraction of the blue cluster galaxies , we compared the spectroscopic catalog with the cm selection and determined that we would lose @xmath100 % of the total luminosity if not including the blue population .",
    "the fraction estimated here for the cluster cl 0152 - 1357 is slightly higher than the value for ms 1054 - 03 obtained by hfk00 who quoted 16% .",
    "we present the cumulative light profile as a function of the radius from the cluster center in figure  [ fig5.7 ] .",
    "we observe that the profile becomes marginally steeper as the radius approaches the field edges because of the increasing contribution from blue cluster galaxies .",
    "the light profile , when reproduced without including the spectroscopically confirmed blue population , showed no such trend . in the wmap cosmology , 1 mpc corresponds to @xmath101 at @xmath102 and the total b - band luminosity within this aperture becomes @xmath103 .",
    "careful selection of background galaxies must be made in both colors and magnitudes in order to maximize the available signals .",
    "we rely on the tight cm relation of the cluster to separate the early - type cluster members from background galaxies .",
    "galaxies whose @xmath85 colors are bluer than @xmath104 are chosen .",
    "the distinction is not apparent at @xmath105 . in an idealized observation where most of galaxies are well resolved",
    ", one can desire to include as faint galaxies as possible because the distortion is greater for higher redshift objects .",
    "however , these faint galaxies are in reality not only more susceptible to measurement noises , but also the amount of correction due to the circularization of the psf is greater , which increases the uncertainty of ellipticities by the same factor . to establish the limiting magnitude for background galaxy selection , we carried out the following `` shear recovery '' test .",
    "after galaxy shapes are measured in the original field of cl 0152 - 1357 , we artificially sheared the entire image by 5 % in real space",
    ". then , the ellipticities of galaxies are determined once more on the distorted image , and we checked how well the applied shear is recovered as a function of magnitude ( figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we observe that in spite of growing uncertainty as magnitude increases , the shear is recovered down to @xmath14 29.5 mag .",
    "another useful experiment is to examine the strength of the tangential shear while varying the magnitude limit of the sample .",
    "tangential shear is defined as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the position angle of the object with respect to the cluster center . if no shear is present , the average of the tangential shear measured in the annulus around the center must approach or oscillate near zero . however",
    ", if the shear is strong enough to be measurable , @xmath108 tends to be positive and the amplitude is proportional to the magnitude of the shear .",
    "we divided all the detected galaxies into `` bright '' ( @xmath109 ) , `` faint '' ( @xmath110 ) , and `` faintest '' ( @xmath111 ) samples , and the amplitude of azimuthal averages of the tangential shear for different samples are compared ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "though it is not apparent whether or not the signal from `` faintest '' galaxies is strongest , the amplitude of tangential shear from `` faint '' and `` faintest '' galaxies are undeniably greater than `` bright '' galaxies .",
    "we also examined the dependence of the lensing signal on source galaxy colors by subdividing these `` faint '' and `` faintest '' samples into `` blue '' and `` red '' subsamples using @xmath112 colors .",
    "we do not detect any significant change in shear strength between different color groups , in contrast to the result of hfk00 who reported their `` blue '' galaxies show stronger signals .",
    "however , the difference must be interpreted with the different depth of the observations in mind .",
    "one plausible scenario is that the faint blue galaxies ( fbgs ) dominate the relatively low redshift , brighter background population whereas the contribution from faint red galaxies becomes increasingly important for fainter background sources at high redshifts .",
    "considering the results of these experiments with the stability of deconvolution , we choose `` faint '' galaxies as our `` best '' sample .",
    "the analysis hereafter is based solely on these galaxies .",
    "the average number density of source galaxies in this sample reaches @xmath113 .",
    "one of the useful methods to examine the significance of the lensing detection as well as the systematics is to perform the following @xmath114 ( cross shear ) test .",
    "if the lensing signal in figure  [ fig6 ] is arising from the gravitational lensing , the resulting shear must disappear when source galaxies are rotated by 45@xmath66 as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig6.5 ] .",
    "we verify that the amplitude of the scatters are consistent with that of the randomization test where source ellipticities are shuffled while galaxy positions are held fixed .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig6.5 ] shows the result from one realization of this radomization .",
    "sufficient knowledge of the redshift distribution of source galaxies is essential in order to achieve a proper scale in subsequent discussion of mass estimates .",
    "the critical surface density of the cluster is given by @xmath115    @xmath116    where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 are the angular diameter distance from the observer to the source , from the observer to the lens and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "compared to low - redshift clusters , the critical surface mass density of high - redshift cluster is a relatively sensitive function of source redshifts .",
    "that is , the angular diameter ratio @xmath120 in equation  [ eqn_beta ] for high - redshift clusters changes more steeply than when the lens is at lower redshifts .",
    "it is certain that the selected source population in [ source_galaxy ] actually contains blue cluster members as well as foreground galaxies .",
    "the presence of these non - background galaxies dilute the shear signal .",
    "we attempt to estimate the fraction of the cluster galaxy contamination in this sample using the publicly available deep acs images from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ultra deep field ( udf ; * ? ? ?",
    "the comparison of magnitude distribution of our source sample with those from these two surveys enables us to determine the fraction of cluster galaxies per magnitude bin up to the cosmic variance . because f606w ( hereafter @xmath121 ) passband is used in both surveys instead of @xmath55 , the @xmath122 color is transformed to the @xmath85 color to maintain the consistent selection criterion . at faint magnitudes ( @xmath105 ) ,",
    "the goods catalog is incomplete . to infer the fraction of the cluster galaxies in this magnitude range , we add noise to the udf images to match the snr of our cluster observations and detect source objects on these degraded images .",
    "it appears that the contamination from the cluster galaxies is not significant over the whole magnitude range ( figure  [ fig_contamination]a ) .",
    "because typical magnitudes of background galaxies are still far beyond spectroscopic reach , we have to estimate the mean redshift of background galaxies via photometric redshift techniques .",
    "we choose to use the photometric redshift catalog of the udf ( d. coe et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) to establish the mean redshift of background galaxies in the cluster field . combining the aforementioned acs udf with the nicmos f110w and f160w ( hereafter @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively ) observations ,",

    "we adjust the nicmos zeropoints based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of the galaxies whose redshifts are spectroscopically confirmed . ]",

    "we generate the photometric redshift catalog of the udf using the bayesian photometric redshift code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bpz ) .",
    "the obvious advantage of the bpz over the maximum - likelihood approach includes the use of the additional information on probability distribution for given magnitudes termed @xmath127 .",
    "we take the redshift distribution of hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) as priors , and the spectral template libraries of e , sbc , scd , and i m by @xcite are selected .",
    "we also added two starburst templates ( sb2 and sb3 ) by @xcite .",
    "the recent post - launch throughput curves of acs ( m. sirianni et al . 2004 , in preparation ) are incorporated into the synthetic photometry of these seds .",
    "the estimated @xmath128 as a function of @xmath24 is shown in figure  [ fig_contamination]b . in order to compute the final @xmath129 for the cluster ,",
    "however , we need to account for the relative number ratio of the background galaxies per magnitude bin as well as the cluster galaxy contamination derived above .",
    "we assume that the foreground fraction of the sample is similar to what we obtain from the udf . using the cosmological parameters considered in the current paper , we find @xmath130 .",
    "this value corresponds to a single source plane at @xmath131 .",
    "the hypothesis that source galaxies are located in a single plane , though convenient , causes biases in the measurement of the reduced shear @xmath132 because actual galaxies have a broad redshift distribution .",
    "the first order correction is approximated by ( seitz & schneider 1997 ; hfk00 )    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is the uncorrected reduced shear from the single - source - plane assumption . from the photometric redshift catalog and equation  [ gprime ] , we determine that the reduced shear would be overestimated by @xmath135 .",
    "we take into account this effect in the nonlinear mass reconstruction .      due to the intrinsic shapes of individual galaxies ,",
    "the local shear at the given location must be estimated statistically from a population of ellipticities . naively taking a simple arithmetic mean",
    "not only ignores the fact that the change in ellipticity @xmath136 due to an applied shear @xmath137 nonlinearly depends on the ellipticity of an object , but also discount the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of source galaxies .",
    "hfk00 considered the weighting scheme combining measurement noise , intrinsic ellipticity , and preseeing shear polarizability in their weak lensing analysis of ms 1054 - 03 .",
    "@xcite and bj02 presented a similar , but more generalized derivation incorporating the distribution of source ellipticities . in this paper",
    "we adopted the `` easy '' weighting scheme suggested in 5.2.3 of the bj02 paper . after smoothing the shapes of galaxies with the weighting function",
    ", we obtained the distortion field in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the whisker plot obviously shows tangential alignments of background galaxies around the cluster center .",
    "since the distortion computed in this way is simply related to the shear by @xmath138 , the shear map can be inverted to construct the parameter - free surface mass density of the cluster .      in the weak lensing regime ( @xmath37 ) , the shear @xmath137 and the dimensionless mass density @xmath32 are simply related by the following convolution :    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the convolution kernel . by simple application of the convolution theorem ,",
    "it is straightforward to invert equation  [ gamma_of_k ] to express @xmath32 in terms of @xmath137 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ks93 ) ,    @xmath141    therefore , in principle once @xmath137 is reliably measured across the field , we can construct a parameter - free surface mass density map either directly from equation  [ k_of_gamma ] or indirectly through maximum - likelihood approach where equation  [ gamma_of_k ] or its variation is used as part of the likelihood function .",
    "the mass reconstruction obtained in this way is a useful tool to probe the substructure of the cluster .",
    "however , normally the direct computation of the physical mass from this map suffers from various artifacts of the reconstruction algorithms .",
    "most serious among them are spurious negative troughs around central mass clumps , thus causing the total mass of the field to approach zero .",
    "this happens in part because typical variants of the original ks93 mass inversion algorithms perform the convolution on a finite field .",
    "but , if the cluster is assumed to be isolated , the boundary effect can be reduced greatly by simply extending the field and extrapolating the measured shear outside the original field @xcite . the recent improvements such as maximum likelihood ( probability )",
    "method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or unbiased finite - field inversion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we experimented with three different algorithms : direct integration after smoothing @xcite , maximum likelihood @xcite , and direct reconstruction based on variational principle @xcite .",
    "we independently implemented the first two algorithms and the last one is kindly provided by the authors .",
    "we refer readers to the individual paper for details of each method .",
    "we observe that the results from the above three algorithms show no noticeable differences except for minor changes near the field boundaries where the signal is expected to be low and biased .",
    "we present the mass reconstruction from the maximum - likelihood algorithm in figure  [ fig9.5 ] .",
    "the resemblance of this mass reconstruction to the luminosity distribution ( figure  [ fig5.8 ] ) is rather remarkable .",
    "the vertically elongated central structure is clearly visible in the reconstructed mass map and the locations of dominant mass peaks inside the main body agree well with those of cluster galaxy concentrations .",
    "we also note that even outside the main body the spatial correlation between the mass overdensity and luminosity peaks is high .",
    "we will discuss the detailed analysis and interpretation of the substructure in [ substructure ] .    despite the high - resolution of our mass reconstruction , the surface mass map in figure  [ fig9.5 ] is not yet ready to be used for inferring the physical mass unless the following ambiguities are resolved .",
    "first , what we measure is the reduced shear @xmath132 rather than the true shear @xmath137 .",
    "that is , we always overestimate @xmath137 because of non - zero @xmath32 .",
    "the deviation can not be ignored near the overdense regions where the assumption @xmath37 breaks down . besides , the correction due to the broad redshift distribution discussed in [ redshift ] becomes important if @xmath32 is not sufficiently small . nevertheless , it is possible to correct these effects by iteratively updating @xmath32 and @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the initial mass reconstruction can be carried out by setting @xmath142 .",
    "now , since the improved information on @xmath32 is available , we can estimate the amount of correction for the original reduced shears @xmath143 , and the updated @xmath137 can be resubmitted into the mass reconstruction .",
    "this @xmath144 cycle converges typically after a few iterations .",
    "the other more fundamental problem is that the shear in equation  [ gamma_of_k ] is invariant under @xmath145 transformation .",
    "this so - called sheet mass degeneracy can not be lifted unless external constraint is provided .",
    "furthermore , without the proper knowledge of this rescaling , we can not achieve the previous nonlinear mass reconstruction because the validity of @xmath32 for the use of updating shear @xmath137 is not guaranteed . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate that this rescaling of the surface density @xmath32 map is in reality possible with the help of the parameterized cluster profile .",
    "the parameterised mass modeling is safe from this sheet - mass degeneracy though the accuracy is sometimes compromised due to the inadequacy of the assumption of a particular mass profile .",
    "we will also show that the direct mass estimates from this `` rescaled '' @xmath32 map are in good agreement with the results from the conventionally favored aperture densitometry @xcite .",
    "in the current section we present the mass estimates of cl 0152 - 1357 through various routes .",
    "first , we discuss the results from parameterized profile fitting . especially for high - redshift clusters , which have a significant substructure",
    ", one does not expect that parameterized models can optimally describe complex profiles . nevertheless , parameterized model fitting is an invaluable procedure not only because it can easily provide a reasonable first - guess of the mass profile of the cluster , but also because the results can be used to estimate the feasible mean surface mass density of the annulus far from the center , thus enabling one to constrain @xmath146 of this region in subsequent mass estimation .",
    "second , we consider aperture mass densitometry which has been a preferred choice in many cluster weak lensing studies because its implementation is straightforward and safe from artifacts arising in most reconstruction algorithms .",
    "finally , we attempt to measure the mass of the cluster directly from the mass reconstruction map presented in the previous section .",
    "we show that , after the consideration of proper rescaling @xmath145 and non - linearity @xmath132 , the mass estimate obtained from the mass map is very close to the results from aperture densitometry .        for a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , the dimensionless surface density @xmath32 is given as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the einstein radius .",
    "it is also easy to show that the simple relation @xmath149 exists for sis .",
    "after iteratively transforming the observed ( reduced ) tangential shears into the true tangential shears @xmath150 , we fit a sis profile to those tangential shears in the annulus from 50@xmath15 to 160@xmath15 . from the typical @xmath151 minimization we find @xmath152 .",
    "in addition , we test if the ellipticity of the cluster can be detected by fitting a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) @xcite .",
    "while a single parameter can characterize sis , sie requires 3 parameters which describe einstein radius @xmath148 , axial ratio @xmath153 , and orientation angle @xmath154 . following the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the surface mass density and shear are related as follows : @xmath155 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are axis ratio and orientation angle of a cluster , respectively .",
    "the corresponding shears are @xmath156 @xmath157    for sie profile fitting we use the smoothed distortion field in the same annulus as in sis fitting .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 ( from the vertical axis ) .",
    "the orientation angle is consistent with the distribution of the cluster galaxies as well as the mass reconstruction .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath153 indicates that the overall mass distribution is highly elongated and the azimuthal variation of the surface mass density is still detectable even at large radii .",
    "we determine the velocity dispersions from the estimated einstein radii of sis and sie to be @xmath161 km @xmath162 and @xmath163 km @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the direct measurements from the redshift survey of the cluster ( r. demarco et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "they measured the velocity dispersion from their spectroscopic data within @xmath22 aperture radii and obtained @xmath164 km @xmath162 and @xmath165 km @xmath162 in rest - frame for the northern and southern clumps , respectively .",
    "it is also possible to compare the velocity dispersions with the cluster temperature estimates from the x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich analyses .",
    "despite the fact that the @xmath166 relation of the galaxy clusters is in general very scattered along the theoretical prediction @xmath167 line , the estimates of @xmath168 kev @xcite , @xmath169 kev @xcite , @xmath170 kev @xcite , or @xmath171 kev @xcite are consistent with these velocity dispersions .",
    "for example , if we adopt the empirical relation ( @xmath172 @xcite , we get @xmath173 kev for the sis velocity dispersion .      the nfw density profile @xcite is defined as :    @xmath174    where @xmath175 is the halo overdensity expressed in terms of the concentration parameter @xmath176 as @xmath177 @xmath178 is the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster , and @xmath179 is the scale radius of the profile .",
    "the relation between mean surface density and gravitational shear is much more complicated in the nfw profile .",
    "the useful mathematical formalisms for gravitational lensing are worked out by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "though many parameters seem to be involved in the characterization of the nfw profile , only two parameters are independent . from the similar @xmath151 minimization as in sis and sie fitting , we estimate the concentration parameter @xmath176 and the scale radius @xmath179 to be @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( @xmath182 kpc ) , respectively .",
    "a virial radius is defined as a radius where the mean interior density drops to 200 times the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster . from the simple relation @xmath183",
    ", the virial radius is estimated to be @xmath184 ( @xmath185 mpc ) .",
    "when one s interest is to find a total mass within some given aperture radius @xmath186 , the following @xmath187 statistics provide a useful measure of lower limits on the mean surface mass density inside r : @xmath188 where @xmath108 is an average of tangential shears defined in equation  [ tan_shear ] , @xmath189 is the aperture radius , and @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the inner- and the outer radii of the annulus . in the weak lensing regime",
    "where the relation between the measured ellipticity and the true shear becomes linear , @xmath192 can be directly computed from the tangential shear to estimate @xmath193 where @xmath194 is an average mass density in the annulus . in principle , if one choose @xmath190 and @xmath191 far enough from the cluster center to make the contribution vanishingly small , the @xmath187 above approaches the genuine average surface mass density within the radius @xmath189 . in the present study",
    ", we used @xmath195 and @xmath196 in order to keep the entire annulus within the observed field . the mean surface density in this annulus",
    "is expected to be low , but it still contributes to @xmath187 . from the result of the sis fit , we estimate the dimensionless mean surface density of this region @xmath197 ) to be @xmath198 .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the mean surface density inside given radii after the contribution from the annulus @xmath194 is added . at small radii ,",
    "@xmath32 is overestimated because of the reasons discussed in [ redshift ] and [ massrecon ] .",
    "the dashed line represents the mean surface density when this correction is applied .",
    "the difference amounts to @xmath199% at @xmath200 .      in [ massrecon ]",
    "we discussed the general difficulties in translating the reconstructed convergence map into the mass density in physical units . in order to lift the @xmath201 degeneracy",
    ", we must be able to constrain @xmath32 at least for a limited region of the field .",
    "this is not impossible , however , because in [ aper_mass ] we were able to estimate the mean surface density @xmath194 in the control annulus from the parameterized mass models .",
    "therefore , we can compare this with the value measured in the same annulus of the mass map .",
    "the transformation parameter @xmath202 becomes no longer arbitrary and can be determined from the relation @xmath203 where @xmath204 is a mean surface density of the annulus from the parameterised models and @xmath146 is the same quantity measured from the mass map .",
    "then , we can apply @xmath205 transformation to the entire region of the mass map .",
    "since this mass map is properly scaled , we can use it to update the shear and feed this corrected shear back to the mass reconstruction .",
    "the procedure is iterated until convergence is reached . in this study , no more than 4 iterations were needed .",
    "we compare the cumulative projected mass profile from this rescaled mass map with the result from the aperture densitometry in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "the excellent agreement between these two profiles demonstrates that at least in an azimuthally averaged sense the mass estimate from the mass map is consistent with the result from the aperture densitometry . in [ substructure ] , we will also determine the mass of the sub - clumps through both of these routes and show that the consistency can be generalized . as far as the rescaling is appropriately calibrated , the use of the rescaled mass map in probing the mass distribution of the cluster has obvious advantages over aperture densitometry .",
    "the aperture densitometry always requires the control annulus to be set up around target apertures , which is sometimes hindered if the annulus can not form a complete circle . besides , to estimate the mean surface mass density inside the annulus",
    ", one has to fit a particular parameterised mass model .",
    "if the discrepancy between the assumed and the actual cluster mass profile is not small ( e.g. due to the substructure ) , the procedure always introduces additional uncertainties . on the contrary",
    ", the direct use of the rescaled mass map does not suffer from these obstacles , and this method can become particularly useful when mass inside some arbitrary boundary needs to be estimated .",
    "the mass profiles from the sis , nfw , and aperture densitometry are compared in figure  [ fig11.2 ] .",
    "we omit the sie fitting result because it overlaps the sis profile very closely .",
    "obviously , the actual cluster mass profile is best approximated by the nfw profile ( solid ) .",
    "if the sis ( dotted ) is assumed instead , the total projected mass is overestimated by @xmath100% at @xmath206 ( @xmath141 mpc ) .",
    "considering the apparent filamentary substructure of cl 0152 - 1357 delineated by either the light or the mass distribution , the excellent representation of the azimuthal mass distribution of the cluster by the nfw profile is rather remarkable .",
    "we summarize the mass estimates inside 1 mpc radius aperture in table 1 for various combinations of cosmological parameters and methods .",
    "we present the mass - to - light ratio profile of cl 0152 - 1357 in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the cumulative mass - to - light ratio @xmath207 ( open circle and dashed ) of the cluster rapidly rises to its maximum at @xmath208 and then decreases rather monotonically .",
    "the decrease of the profile looks more pronounced in the differential mass - to - light ratio @xmath209 ( dotted ) .",
    "it is verified that the profile when the blue cluster galaxies are excluded does not significantly change though the slope is slightly reduced .",
    "the small mass - to - light ratio near the cluster center seems to originate from the luminosity segregation of the brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied the average mass - to - light profiles of 14 galaxy clusters from the virial mass estimator .",
    "the resulting mass - to - light ratio averaged over substructure and asymmetries is high in the inner regions and gradually decreases until it starts to flatten at @xmath210 .",
    "the average mass - to - light profile obtained from the kinematics and distribution of 3056 galaxies in 59 nearby clusters in the eso nearby abell cluster survey also shows a similar trend of a rapid rise followed by a gradual decrease up to @xmath210 .",
    "does the upturn of the m / l profile of cl 0152 - 1357 at @xmath211 correspond to the beginning of the plateau observed in those works ? assuming the feature is real and the empirical relation @xmath212 holds , the virial radius of the cluster can be evaluated to be @xmath213 ( @xmath214 mpc ) .",
    "this value is surprisingly close to the independent estimation from nfw fitting in [ nfw_fitting ] .",
    "the average m / l ratio of the cluster within 1 mpc aperture radius is estimated to be @xmath215 @xmath11 .",
    "it is of interest to compare this value with the result for ms 1054 - 03 at a very similar redshift of @xmath216 . in @xmath217 and @xmath218",
    "cosmology hfk00 quoted the m / l ratio of @xmath219 , which is higher than that of cl 0152 - 1357 by @xmath220% .",
    "the result is consistent with the still arguable , but popular belief that the cluster m / l increases with richness .",
    "the m / l profile of ms 1054 - 03 by hfk00 shows the gradual increase of the m / l ratio out to the field limit .",
    "if the m / l profile of ms 1054 - 03 is assumed to conform to the aforementioned average m / l profile at large radii , we may suggest that the aperture of 1 mpc in ms 1054 - 03 field encompass only the inner region where the m / l is still high .",

    "the relation predicts @xmath223% reduction in b - band luminosity and the m / l ratio of cl 0152 - 1357 is modified to be @xmath224 , which is similar to the results for other clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "due to the high number density of background galaxies whose shapes are reliably measurable , the reconstructed mass map reveals the cluster substructure in great detail . we overplot the rescaled mass reconstruction on the negative gray image of cl 0152 - 1357 in figure  [ fig11.5 ] .",
    "we identified 9 mass clumps whose significance is above @xmath225 and galaxy counterparts are apparent .",
    "the significance for each mass pixel is computed by the use of the rms mass map ( figure  [ fig_rmsmap ] ) , which is constructed from bootstrap 5000 realizations of mass reconstruction .",

    "the mass of these clumps within @xmath226 aperture ( @xmath227 kpc ) are computed via the direct use of the reconstruction map as well as the examination of @xmath228 statistics ( table 2 ) .",
    "they are in good agreement with each other with overlapping uncertainties .",
    "though the @xmath229  @xmath230 first detected x - ray emission from cl 0152 - 1357 , its significance was not properly recognized because of the complex morphology of the emission .",
    "the cluster was rediscovered in the warps @xcite , the rdcs @xcite and the sharc @xcite survey .",
    "@xcite analyzed the x - ray observation of cl 0152 - 1357 from the warps survey and showed that the x - ray morphology of the cluster is suggestive of very complex substructure that can be also traced by cluster galaxy concentrations .",
    "the higher resolution of @xmath3 extended the work by @xcite and revealed two prominent x - ray peaks @xcite . in order to verify their results and also enable a direct comparison of the x - ray morphology with our weak lensing mass distribution , we reanalyzed the archival @xmath3 observations .",
    "after adaptively smoothing the x - ray image via `` csmooth '' , which is part of the chandra interactive analysis of observations software ( ciao ) , we obtained the x - ray contour map of the cluster which we overlaid on the acs image ( figure  [ fig11.6 ] ) .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the acs image with respect to the guide star catalog 2 ( gsc-2 ) is @xmath231 .",
    "considering @xmath232 errors on the gsc-2 itself and also the absolute astrometric accuracy of the @xmath3 observation being @xmath233 , we expect the alignment between the two images are fairly precise , and the excellent agreements of the locations of x - ray point sources with those of the optical counter parts confirm this fact .",
    "the two main diffuse x - ray peaks , though slightly off - center from two concentrations of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members , seem to correspond to the mass clumps c and f in our weak lensing map ( figure  [ fig11.5 ] ) . the mass clump a , which is associated with the @xmath234 group of galaxies ( r. demarco et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) , is also detected as extended low surface brightness region in the @xmath3 observation though this location is somewhat remote from that of the galaxy concentration . in addition",
    ", one of the point - like x - ray sources appears to be associated with the mass clump e. @xcite examined the x - ray excess emission from the residual image which is constructed by subtracting the best - fit model .",
    "they discovered that the regions of excess emission lie midway between the two major clumps , stretched perpendicular to the merging direction .",
    "they also found that the x - ray temperature of this region is relatively higher . though they were not conclusive because of the low significance of the feature , the presence of a shock front was suggested .",
    "it is remarkable that the feature is also seen in the weak lensing mass map as clumps d and e. however , the cause of the mass concentration in this region can not be exclusively ascribed to a shock which originates from the merger of two major subclusters .",
    "the cluster light distribution suggests that there may also be cluster galaxies associated with these clumps .",
    "it is interesting to examine the displacements of peaks between the weak lensing mass map and the x - ray flux contours .",
    "we present overplots for three different combinations : x - ray / optical ( figure  [ fig11.7 ] ) , mass / optical ( figure  [ fig11.8 ] ) , and mass / x - ray ( figure  [ fig11.9 ] ) . in general , weak lensing mass distribution better traces the light distribution of the cluster as far as the overall morphology and coincidence of clump locations are concerned .",
    "as @xcite observed , the location of the southern x - ray peak is offset by @xmath235 from the galaxies and displaced away from the direction of the merger .",
    "they proposed that the displacement is due to the fact that relatively collisionless galaxies are moving ahead of the viscous icm whose distribution is delineated by the x - rays .",
    "we observe that the similar trend for the northern x - ray peak is also noticeable but with smaller displacement .",
    "the offset is more obvious when the location of the northern x - ray peak is compared with the smoothed luminosity center ( not with the brightest galaxies ; figure  [ fig11.7 ] ) . by examining the significance of the event counts around the northern x - ray peak",
    ", we verified that the offset is not likely to be caused by artifacts of adaptive smoothing .",
    "similar , but more pronounced centroid offsets were detected in the @xmath3 study of the merging cluster 1e 0657 - 56 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray image shows that the x - ray centroids of two clumps are conspicuously displaced from the cluster galaxy concentrations , suggesting the ram - pressure stripping of the gas components of the cluster .",
    "if the dark matter is indeed collionless and is the dominant contributor to the total cluster mass , the location of the mass peaks must be separated from the x - ray centroids .",
    "@xcite performed a weak lensing analysis of the same cluster and showed that the reconstructed mass peaks are displaced from the x - ray halos while in good spatial agreements with the galaxy concentrations .    in our mass reconstruction of cl 0152 - 1357",
    ", we find that the two mass clumps detected in the weak lensing map are also shifted toward the suspected merging direction with respect to the luminosity as well as the x - ray distribution ( figure  [ fig11.8 ] and  [ fig11.9 ] ) .",
    "centroids of weak lensing mass clumps are in general affected by shape noise , shear strength , reconstruction algorithm artifacts , spatial number density variations of source galaxies , etc . though most of these factors are present to a varying degree in our mass reconstruction , we expect the uncertainties of these two centroids are relatively low compared to those of outside the main body because of their high significance in the reconstructed mass map .",
    "furthermore , it is understood that the high number density of source galaxies ( @xmath1 objects @xmath2 ) increases the overall stability of the centroids of our weak lensing mass peaks .",
    "one of the useful tests to quantify the centroid uncertainty is to examine how much the locations of the mass peaks change when the shears are perturbed slightly .",
    "motivated by the experiment of @xcite , we measured the centroids of the two mass peaks in 5000 runs of mass reconstruction obtained in  [ bootstrap ] by bootstrap resampling .",
    "the resulting distribution of the two mass peaks are presented in figure  [ fig_centroid ] .",
    "it shows that both of the two light peaks are outside the 99% circle .",
    "the rms distance of the northen ( clump c ) and southern ( clump f ) peaks are @xmath236 and @xmath237 , respectively . the smaller rms scatter of the northern peak is consistent with the higher significance in the reconstructed mass map .",
    "the presence of these preferential shifts in the detected clumps may extend the argument above and further support the collisionless nature of cdm . within the paradigm of the hierarchical structure formation",
    ", the shifts may indicate that the cdm which initially created the deep potential well for the formation of the subclusters is moving even faster than galaxies which are less subject to ram pressure than the icm , but not entirely collionless as the cdm .",
    "we observe that there lie four bright foreground @xmath89 galaxies to the south of the bcgs .",
    "if they are massive enough to perturb the distortion of background galaxies , the centroid of the northern clump can be affected and appear to be further shifted toward the merging direction . however , though we can not completely rule out this possibility , we suspect that their contribution to the centroid shift is not so substantive as to cause the distinct offset between the x - ray and dark matter contours ( figure  [ fig11.9 ] ) .",
    "more study of these questions regarding the centroid offsets among galaxies , x - ray emission , and weak lensing mass will be conducted when the weak lensing analysis of another supposedly merging cluster , ms 1054 - 03 at @xmath216 , with acs observations ( m. jee et al .",

    "we compare the mass estimates of the cluster with those from the @xmath3 x - ray spectral analysis @xcite and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) work @xcite by treating the cluster as a whole to simplify the comparison .",
    "@xcite infer that the total mass within a radius of @xmath238 in @xmath239 and @xmath240 @xmath241 universe is @xmath242 from their sze measurement of the cluster temperature .",
    "the weak lensing mass under the same cosmological parameters yields @xmath243 . from the @xmath3",
    "x - ray analysis @xcite quotes an estimate of @xmath244 within @xmath22 radius aperture in @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath245 @xmath241 universe .",
    "our conversion of the weak lensing mass under the same geometry is estimated to be @xmath246 .",
    "we note that the weak lensing mass estimate is lower by @xmath247% in both comparisons though the statistical significance of the difference is low .",
    "in the temperature - based measurement of the cluster mass , the dynamical equilibrium of the intracluster gas with the underlying dark matter as well as the spherical symmetry of the matter distribution must be assumed .",
    "however , the on - going merger obviously violates these hypotheses and especially the temperature rise caused by the shock may result in the overestimation of the cluster mass .",
    "the x - ray mass estimate of @xmath248 within 1.4mpc radius ( extrapolated to the virial radius under the assumption of the isothermal sphere ) by @xcite is roughly a factor of two higher than the result from the current paper even considering the aforesaid risk of overestimation as well as the dissimilar geometry .",
    "we attribute this rather large difference to the two following reasons .",
    "first , as discussed in [ summaryofmass ] , the mass profile of cl 0152 - 1357 is better described by the nfw profile .",
    "the sis modeling of the cluster profile gives substantially higher total mass than the nfw representation does at large radii ( leading to @xmath249% increase at @xmath250 mpc ) .",
    "second , the mass of the southern x - ray peak from this weak lensing analysis is much lower than the northern one ( less than 50 percent of the northern x - ray peak within @xmath226 aperture radius , see table  3 ) whereas @xcite estimates that the two peaks are of similar mass .",
    "therefore , the total virial mass of cl 0152 - 1357 computed by the superposition of two comparable sis clumps is likely to be much higher than the result from the current analysis .",
    "@xcite presented the first weak lensing analysis of cl 0152 - 1357 using keck r band observations .",
    "the projected cluster mass of @xmath251 within @xmath252 mpc can be read off figure 10 of their paper .",
    "the transformation of our mass estimate in their cosmological parameters gives @xmath253 . despite the somewhat large discrepancy in mass",
    ", we do not further analyze the difference because the intermediate procedures of the weak lensing analysis ( e.g. , psf corrections , tangential shears , reconstruction maps , redshift distribution of background galaxies , etc . )",
    "are not illustrated in their work .",
    "we have presented our weak lensing analysis of the x - ray luminous cluster cl 0152 - 1357 at @xmath254 using acs observations .",
    "the superb resolution and sensitivity of acs provides high quality images of weakly distorted , faint background galaxies in unprecedented depth .",
    "the resulting high number density of source galaxies enables us to restore the cluster mass distribution in unparalleled detail when the instrument artifact is properly accounted for . the complicated shape and variation of the psf",
    "is precisely modeled by exhaustive investigation of the 47 tuc stars , and the derived psf is matched to the isolated good signal - to - ratio stars in cl 0152 - 1357 field after a slight fine - tuning of the ellipticity . rounding kernel test shows that the final psf obtained in this way",
    "nicely describes the observed psf pattern in cl 0152 - 1357 field .",
    "we use the publicly available goods and udf images to infer the fraction of cluster galaxy contamination in source galaxies , and the redshift distribution of background galaxies is estimated by the use of the photometric redshift catalog of the udf .",
    "we determine the cluster mass via three different approaches : parameterized profile fitting , mass reconstruction , and aperture mass densitometry . among these approaches ,",
    "the second method of mass estimation from the reconstruction map is unconventional .",
    "the direct use of the weak lensing mass map has been discouraged primarily because there exists a sheet - mass degeneracy .",
    "however , we show that , after proper rescaling is considered , the method yields very consistent results with the measurements from the often favored aperture mass densitometry .    our weak lensing mass estimates at small radii ( @xmath255 )",
    "are consistent with the results from the x - ray emission and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "we show that the deviation of the mass profile from the sis profile increases at larger radii .",
    "the overall mass profile of the cluster can be well described by the nfw profile with a scale radius of @xmath4 kpc and a concentration parameter of @xmath5 .",
    "we estimate the total projected cluster mass within 1 mpc aperture to be ( 4.92 @xmath9 0.44)@xmath10 from the aperture mass densitometry .",
    "the total luminosity of the cluster is calculated by combining the spectroscopic and the red sequence catalogs .",
    "when @xmath93 is transformed to the rest frame b , the total luminosity ( @xmath256 mpc ) after accounting for the blue and the faint population is determined to be @xmath257 .",
    "we find that the m / l ratio within 1 mpc is @xmath258 8 @xmath11 .",
    "considering the luminosity evolution at @xmath254 , this m / l ratio corresponds to @xmath224 at local universe .",
    "our acs weak lensing reveals very interesting substructure of the cluster in detail .",
    "the vertically elongated cluster main body is clearly seen in both light and mass distributions with strong spatial correlations between light and mass clumps . besides , we identify 4 scattered mass clumps outside the main body with locations of cluster galaxy concentrations .",
    "more stimulating interpretation is made when the mass reconstruction is compared with the x - ray morphology from @xmath3 observations . in order to examine the spatial correlations between the two analyses , we reprocess the @xmath3 archival data and overlay the x - ray contours with those of optical light and mass maps .",
    "we observe that the two diffuse x - ray clumps are in spatial agreement with cluster galaxy concentrations , but are displaced away from the assumed merging direction .",
    "the displacement of the southern peak was originally noticed by @xcite and they suggested that the icm is lagging behind the cluster galaxies due to the ram pressure .",
    "the comparision of the x - ray emission with our mass reconstruction strengthens this merger hypothesis because both the cluster galaxies and mass clumps seem to lead the x - ray peaks .",
    "furthermore , we remark on the displacements of the mass clumps relative to the light concentrations .",
    "it appears in the mass - light comparison map the two major mass clumps are slightly shifted ( @xmath259 ) toward the merging direction .",
    "the existence of these preferential shifts might suggest that the collisionless dark matters are moving ahead of cluster galaxies .",
    "though the weak lensing survey data from today s extensive dedication of many large aperture ground - based telescopes , primarily targeted for the cosmic shear detection , surpass those of acs in data volume , our weak lensing analysis of cl 0152 - 1357 demonstrates that acs is exclusively advantageous for weak lensing studies of high - redshift clusters which require only moderately large field of view , but extremely high resolution of the instrument .",
    "the acs gto cluster survey program encompasses many high - reshift clusters of great interest and the weak lensing investigation of these clusters will provide many illuminating clues to the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in the near future .",
