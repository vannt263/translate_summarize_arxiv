    "this formula does not in fact give a chain unless all of the intersections @xmath30 have the same dimension , so some restriction on the pair @xmath31 is necessary .",
    "generically , the intersection of a @xmath32dimensional pl subspace and a @xmath33dimensional pl subspace has dimension @xmath34 ; pairs of pl subspaces with this property are said to be in _ general position_. lefschetz restricts the domain of the intersection pairing to pairs @xmath31 for which all of the pairs @xmath35 are in general position , and he interprets terms @xmath36 which are in dimension less than @xmath37 as 0 .    in order to prove the crucial formula @xmath38 lefschetz imposes a further restriction on the domain of the intersection pairing : he requires that all of the pairs @xmath39 and @xmath40 should also be in general position . and @xmath6 are chains on the _ same triangulation _ this condition forces @xmath24 to be 0 , because @xmath28 and @xmath29 will intersect along a common face and therefore @xmath36 will be contained in @xmath41 . ]",
    "this assumption allows him to prove equation by working with one pair of simplices at a time and extending additively .",
    "this definition has the disadvantage that the domain of the intersection pairing is not invariant under subdivision .",
    "for example , if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath44simplices in a @xmath45manifold intersecting at a point in the interior of both , then the pair @xmath46 is in the domain , but if we subdivide @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the intersection point we obtain a pair of chains @xmath47 which is not in the domain ( because for example the pair @xmath48 is not in general position ) .",
    ", then formula gives @xmath49 but @xmath50 .",
    "] this phenomenon is general : if @xmath31 is in the domain of this version of the intersection pairing with @xmath51 then there will always be a subdivision in which the pair of chains determined by @xmath5 and @xmath6 is not in the domain .",
    "lefschetz returned to the chain - level intersection pairing in ( * ? ? ? * section iv.6 ) .",
    "he gave a formula more general than ( equation ( 46 ) on page 212 ) in which the coefficients are `` looping coefficients '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iv.5 ) .",
    "this allowed him to enlarge the domain of the intersection pairing as follows : if we write @xmath52 for the union of the simplices that occur in @xmath5 , then @xmath24 is defined when the three pairs @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are in general position ; note that this condition is invariant under subdivision .",
    "the `` looping coefficients '' used in lefschetz s second definition are tricky to define explicitly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 58 on page 216 ) .",
    "the theory has been worked out carefully in keller @xcite ( which i have not had an opportunity to consult ) and seems to be rather complicated ( see the math review ) .    the chain - level intersection pairing became temporarily obsolete when the cup product was discovered and it was noticed that the intersection pairing in homology could be defined using only poincar duality and the cup product , without any recourse to the chain level .",
    "goresky and macpherson returned to the chain - level intersection pairing as a tool for constructing an intersection pairing in intersection homology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "they introduced the pl chain complex @xmath1 ( as the direct limit of simplicial chains under subdivision ; see ) and defined the intersection pairing ( which they denoted by @xmath56 ) on a certain subset of @xmath57 by means of an elegant construction in which the procedure of the previous paragraph is reversed : the chain - level intersection pairing is derived from the relative versions of poincar duality and the cup product .",
    "their version of the chain - level intersection pairing is probably equivalent to lefschetz s second definition .    in order to prove ( or even state ) it is necessary to extend the domain of the intersection pairing from a subset of @xmath57 to a subset of @xmath2 .",
    "the obvious way to do this would be to consider elements @xmath58 in which every pair @xmath59 is in the domain of the goresky  macpherson intersection pairing @xmath56 and to define the intersection pairing on such an element to be @xmath60 but it is not at all clear that this is well defined , and it also is not clear how to determine when an element of @xmath2 has the required form ( which would make it difficult to show that the domain of the operation is a full subcomplex ) .    the definition to be given in resolves both of these issues by defining the intersection pairing ( up to a dimension shift ) as the composite of the exterior product @xmath61 ( see ) and the chain - level umkehr map @xmath62 induced by the diagonal ( see ) ; here @xmath63 denotes the set of chains @xmath64 in @xmath65 for which both @xmath64 and @xmath66 are in general position with respect to the diagonal . with this definition ,",

    "we begin by reviewing some basic definitions .    a _ simplicial complex _",
    "@xmath70 is a set of simplices in @xmath71 ( for some @xmath72 ) with two properties : every face of a simplex in @xmath70 is in @xmath70 and the intersection of two simplices in @xmath70 is a common face .",

    "if we choose orientations for the simplices of @xmath70 ( with no requirement of consistency among the orientations ) then every nonzero element @xmath80 of @xmath73 can be written uniquely in the form @xmath81 with all @xmath82 .",
