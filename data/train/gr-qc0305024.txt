    "the construction of astrophysically relevant initial data is a crucial prerequisite to using numerical relativity as a predictive tool in gravitational wave astronomy , i.e. in producing gravitational waveform templates to be used in searches for signals in modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo600 , and tama300 .",
    "after all , the comparison between results from a numerical relativity evolution code and any observed astrophysical phenomena would be meaningless unless the initial data used in the numerical evolution corresponds to an astrophysically realistic situation .",
    "in particular , numerical relativists are interested in constructing astrophysically realistic initial data corresponding to the late stages of the inspiral process of compact objects ( black holes and neutron stars ) , so that the transition from the final few orbits to the subsequent coalescence and formation of the final merged object can be numerically simulated using the full nonlinear theory of general relativity to accurately detail these highly nonlinear phenomena . to date ,",
    "all initial data constructed for this purpose employ some sort of circular orbit assumption in the construction of the initial data .",
    "for instance , many quasiequilibrium studies assume the existence of a helical killing vector field in the construction of configurations that correspond to compact object binaries that are instantaneously in circular motion  @xcite .",
    "other methods employ turning point techniques to arrive at circular orbit configurations  @xcite .",
    "it is typically argued that because the timescale of the gravitational radiation is longer than the orbital timescale of the binary , the assumption of quasiequilibrium is a good one .",
    "however , as the orbital separation of the compact objects decreases during the evolutionary progression of the binary , the timescale of the gravitational radiation process increases while the orbital timescale decreases . in other words ,",
    "quasiequilibrium assumptions become increasingly inaccurate as the compact objects get closer .",
    "it is therefore imperative to assess , in an astrophysically meaningful way , at what point during the inspiral process the quasiequilibrium approximation breaks down . in this paper , we present a method for calculating a lower bound on the error of the quasiequilibrium approximation for inspiraling binaries .",
    "this method is demonstrated by calculating this lower bound for equal mass black hole / black hole binaries and neutron star / neutron star binaries .",
    "one specific aspect of the quasiequilibrium approximation is the circular orbit assumption , and it is precisely this aspect which we analyze in this paper . our analysis is carried out within a post - newtonian non - spinning point particle approximation . using initial data corresponding to two particles in circular orbit , we solve the post - newtonian equations of motion to find the resulting evolution of the binary system .",
    "the purpose of this calculation is twofold .",
    "first , we seek to quantitatively assess the circular orbit assumption in the construction of initial data in full general relativity .",
    "we do this by computing the correlation function of the gravitational wave signal produced from the evolution starting with particles in circular orbit with the gravitational wave signal from the true quasicircular evolution ( i.e. , the unique , `` fully circularized '' evolution of the binary system within the post - newtonian approximation ) .",
    "this gives us a meaningful measure of the error introduced by the circular orbit assumption in the initial data .",
    "second , we wish to have a baseline with which to compare fully general relativistic calculations ( i.e. , calculations in numerical relativity ) using initially circular orbiting compact objects as initial data .",
    "we find that , as expected , the initial circular orbit assumption becomes progressively worse as the initial separation of the compact objects decreases .",
    "specifically , we find that for equal mass black hole binaries , the initial separation must exceed a separation such that @xmath4 ( @xmath2 ) orbits remain before plunge in order to bound the detection event loss rate in gravitational wave detectors to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this method is less efficient in calculating the lower bound of the error induced by the initial circular orbit approximation for neutron stars , due to the fact that hydrodynamical effects will become important earlier in the evolution of the binary . as a result ,",
    "the lower bound in the detection event loss rate for equal mass neutron stars that we calculate are never larger than several percent .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : quasicircular ] , we describe the post - newtonian equations of motion for two particles .",
    "we solve these equations for very large initial separation , thus producing the unique , `` fully circularized '' solution corresponding to the last 1000 quasicircular orbits of the binary inspiral . in section  [ sec : circular ] , we formulate initial data corresponding to compact objects in initially circular orbits for various initial separations and compare the resulting gravitational wave signals to the true quasicircular gravitational wave signals . in section  [ sec : nr ] , we introduce a local definition of eccentricity which we find useful for comparisons to numerical relativity calculations , and compute the expected eccentricity as a function of initial separation that one can expect to find in numerical relativity calculations using initial data corresponding to initially circular orbiting compact binaries .",
    "we compare these results with a fully consistent numerical relativity calculation of a neutron star binary inspiral using circular orbit initial data . in the conclusions , section  [ sec : conclusions ]",
    ", we comment on the implications our results have on the astrophysical relevance of current innermost circular orbit ( ico ) calculations .",
