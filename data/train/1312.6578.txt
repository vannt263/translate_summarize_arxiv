    "one of the most classical inequalities in the theory od convex functions is the hermite  hadamard inequality .",
    "it states that if @xmath0 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] is convex then @xmath1 it plays an important role in convex analysis , so in the literature one can find its various generalizations and applications .",
    "for example , an exhausting study of this inequality is given in  the book  @xcite .",
    "recall that a function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a  convex set , is called _ wright - convex _ ( w - convex for short ) , if @xmath4 for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "trivially we can see that any convex function is necessarily w - convex and any w - convex function is jensen - convex ( i.e. it fulfills the above inequality with @xmath7 ) . however , these inclusions are proper",

    "it states that any w - convex function defined on an  open and convex set @xmath3 is the sum of an additive function @xmath8 and a convex function @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath10 is w - convex , then either @xmath11 is continuous ( and then convex ) , or the graph of  @xmath11 is a dense subset of a  plane .",
    "hence by putting @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a  discontinuous additive function , we obtain a  jensen - convex function , which is not w - convex .",
    "of course , the function @xmath14 is a  w - convex function , which is not convex .",
    "it was natural to generalize the hermite  hadamard inequality to the functions of several variables . in the case of simplices , for the first time",
    "it was done by neuman  @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the functions defined on simplices and @xcite , @xcite for more general domains ) .",
    "recently olbry  @xcite obtained the following inequality of hermite  hadamard type : if @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is an open interval ) is w - convex , then @xmath17 for any @xmath18 . because the note  @xcite is actually unpublished ,",
    "let us mention that   is an immediate consequence of the hermite  hadamard inequality .",
    "it is enough to apply it to the convex ( due to ng s representation of  @xmath11 ) function @xmath19\\ni x\\mapsto f(x)+f(a+b - x)$ ] .    motivated by this beautiful olbry s",
