    "because it is important to reduce the phonon thermal conductivity in the optimization of @xmath0 , we need to consider a qda nanowire with long length . therefore , before investigating the te properties of qdas with large number of coupled dots , we first consider the simplest structure of qda , which consists of serially coupled triple qds ( sctqd ) .",
    "although we have theoretically studied the transport and te properties of triple qd molecules with full solution in the coulomb blockade regime,[28,29 ] it is still a challenging work to obtain the full solution to the charge transport through qdas with more than three dots due to the fact that the calculation scales up exponentially . to solve such a difficult problem",
    "many efforts which adopt some approximation schemes were attempted.[9,30 - 32 ] the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) is often used to investigate the te coefficients of realistic molecules.[30 - 32 ] as a consequence , it is desirable to examine the validity of such a mean - field approach . at high temperatures , in the absence of interdot coulomb interactions the results based on the approach of ref .",

    "this is a consequence of the electron - hole symmetry possessed by the sctqd structures in the absence of interdot coulomb interactions [ 29 ] . at low temperature ( @xmath142 )",

    "for example , the maximum @xmath3 of dot - dashed lines is larger than @xmath150 ( quantum conductance ) , but not for oca .",
    "this is due to the inability of hfa to include electron correlation .",
    "the energy positions of resonant channels within hfa depend on the average occupation number in each qd.[30 - 32 ] , which can be a fractional number .",
    "in contrast , within oca the energy positions of resonant channels are determined by integer charges , while electron correlation functions and fractional occupation numbers only appear in the probability weights of quantum paths.[9 ] in addition , we observe an unphysical enhancement of @xmath133 in the middle of the coulomb gap @xmath151 for hfa results ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "this illustrates the drawback of hfa calculation for te coefficients of qds at low temperatures when the charging process plays a significant role . at high temperatures ( for example , @xmath152 ) ,",

    ", these two approaches agree well with each other when qd energy levels are far above @xmath153 .",
