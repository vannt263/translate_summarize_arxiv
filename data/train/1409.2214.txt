    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-dimensional stochastic process defined on a probability space @xmath2 by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a @xmath5-dimensional standard brownian motion , @xmath6 is a @xmath1-dimensional drift process and @xmath7 is a @xmath8-valued cdlg volatility process . in mathematical finance",
    "it is widely accepted that processes @xmath0 of the form defined by ( [ eqx ] ) are reasonable models for the ( log return of ) price processes and interest rates .",
    "the spot cross volatility matrix @xmath9 of process @xmath0 is defined by @xmath10    we are interested in the following problem : given a finite set of observation data @xmath11 of a single trajectory @xmath12 , we want to estimate the eigenvalues of @xmath13 for any @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "this problem appears in mathematical finance , especially in principal component analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the estimation of the eigenvalues of the integrated volatility matrix was studied by wang and zou ( @xcite ) ( see also the references therein ) . by the time we completed this paper",
    ", we learnt that jacod and podolskij @xcite had previously introduced some statistics based on a random perturbation approach for ranks of volatility metric of continuous it process .",
    "our approach differs from that in @xcite and can be applied to it processes with jump components .    our method to solve",
    "this problem is as follows : first we approximate the spot cross volatility matrix @xmath15 by a matrix @xmath16 using the given observations of @xmath0 ; next we approximate the eigenvalues of @xmath15 by those of @xmath16 .",
    "the spot volatility estimation is an important problem in mathematical finance and has been extensively studied by many authors . up to now",
    ", there are two main approaches to this problem .",
    "the first approach called the fourier series method was introduced by @xcite and later developed in @xcite .",
    "the second approach called the quadratic variation method was introduced by @xcite and later developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that there is a very rich literature on the problem of measuring the so called realized volatility as well as problem of estimating parameters of diffusion processes , see @xcite and the references therein .    in this paper , we present some limit theorems and a numerical study to analyze the effectiveness of the estimation of eigenvalues by using fourier series and quadratic variation methods .",
    "it should be mentioned that in reality , one can not observe directly either cross volatility matrix or the eigenvalues .",
    "therefore we perform a numerical study with dummy data for which we know both the volatility matrix and its eigenvalues beforehand . in particular , we show that the fourier series method may lead to some unexpected results when estimating small eigenvalues ; this situation would never arise using the quadratic variation method .",
    "the authors thank jiro akahori , freddy delbaen , arturo kohatsu - higa , maria elvira mancino , and shigeyoshi ogawa for their helpful comments .",
    "the authors are also grateful to the referee for her / his valuable comments which led to improvement of the paper .",
    "in a series of papers @xcite , malliavin et al . introduced a number of fourier series estimation schemes for spot volatilities .",
    "although these schemes are essentially based on a same idea , they are slightly different . as we will present later , each scheme has both advantages and disadvantages compared to the other .    in this section ,",
    "we summarize the fourier series method presented in @xcite . by a change of origin and rescaling",
    ", one can suppose that @xmath17 and the fourier series method reconstructs @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "let us denote the fourier coefficients of @xmath20 by @xmath21 the fourier coefficients of each cross volatility @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 it follows from the fourier - fjer inversion formula that one can reconstruct @xmath15 from its fourier coefficients by @xmath24 in practice , based on the observation of @xmath0 at times @xmath25 , one can approximate @xmath15 as follows .",
    "we fix some positive integer @xmath26 .    1 .",
    "fourier coefficients @xmath27 are approximated by @xmath28 2 .",
    "fourier coefficients of each cross volatility @xmath29 are approximated by @xmath30 for each @xmath31 .",
    "the volatilities @xmath32 are approximated by @xmath33    sometime , it is preferable to smooth the fjer kernel in ( [ def_hatsm ] ) by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath35 for some appropriate parameter @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted here that although the matrix @xmath37 is symmetric , it is not non - negative definite in general",
    ". therefore some of its eigenvalues may be negative , which is not expected in practice .",
    "in @xcite , the authors introduced another version of fourier series estimation scheme .",
    "their new scheme was designed to deal with asynchronous data . in the following",
    ", we will specialize it for the case of regular sampling .",
    "we define @xmath38 for any integer @xmath39 , @xmath40 , let @xmath41 for each @xmath42 let @xmath43 for @xmath44 be given by @xmath45 finally , define @xmath46 since the above estimator is written with complex numbers , it may be inconvenient to do simulation . therefore we rewrite it as below : @xmath47 where @xmath48,\\\\ b^{j_1 j_2}_k & = \\frac{1}{\\pi(2n+1)}\\big [ \\sum^{n}_{s=1 } \\big\\{\\hat{a}_{s}(dx^{j_1})\\hat{b}_{k - s}(dx^{j_2 } ) + \\hat{b}_{s}(dx^{j_1})\\hat{a}_{k - s}(dx^{j_2})\\\\ & \\hskip 1 cm + \\hat{a}_{s}(dx^{j_1})\\hat{b}_{k+s}(dx^{j_2 } ) - \\hat{b}_{s}(dx^{j_1})\\hat{a}_{k+s}(dx^{j_2})\\big\\ } + \\hat{b}_{k}(dx^{j_2})\\big(x^{j_1}(2\\pi ) - x^{j_1}(0)\\big)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , @xmath49 and @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the matrix @xmath51 is not symmetric , the eigenvalues may not be real numbers . in order to overcome this drawback we propose two symmetrization methods as follows .      a naive idea to symmetrize the covariance matric is that one first calculates @xmath52 using formula ( [ gammaold ] ) for all @xmath53 and then puts @xmath54 .      another way to symmetrize the covariance matric is as follows : denote @xmath55 for any @xmath44 and define @xmath46 to simplify the simulation , we rewrite @xmath52 as follows @xmath56 where @xmath57,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 are defined as before .",
    "each matrix @xmath51 is symmetric , but not necessary positive definite .",
    "since for each @xmath60 , @xmath61 is a symmetric non - negative definite matrix , we denote its eigenvalues by @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath64 the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath51 defined by either the first or the second symmetrization .",
    "now we are in a position to state the first main result of this paper .",

    "however , these authors did not provide any discussion on the asymptotic behaviour of the estimators .",
    "we briefly recall the quadratic variation method which was proposed in ogawa and wakayama @xcite .",
    "let @xmath70 be a sequence of positive numbers satisfying @xmath71 . for each @xmath72",
    ", we denote @xmath73 we suppose that the diffusion coefficient @xmath7 satisfies the following hlder continuous condition    @xmath74 : for some @xmath75 $ ] , there exists a constant @xmath76 such that for all @xmath77 $ ] , @xmath78 for each @xmath79 , the approximating matrix @xmath80 is symmetric , non - negative defined .",
    "hence all of its eigenvalues are non - negative .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath82 .",
    "here is the second main result of this paper .",
    "[ theoremqv1 ] assume that assumption @xmath74 holds for some @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath83 .",
    "then we have @xmath84 for some constant @xmath85 which does not depend on @xmath86 .",
    "+ in particular , if @xmath87 then @xmath88    in the following , we will study the case where the price process @xmath0 contains jump components .",
    "more precisely , we suppose that @xmath0 is a @xmath1-dimensional stochastic process defined by @xmath89 where @xmath90 are defined as in section 1 and @xmath91 is a @xmath1-dimensional lvy process which may depend on @xmath4 .",
    "the blumenthal - getoor index @xmath92 of @xmath91 is defined by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is lvy measure of @xmath91 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath95 $ ] .    for each @xmath72",
    ", we denote @xmath96 where the summation is taken over all indices @xmath97 such that @xmath98 and @xmath99    let @xmath100 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath101 .",
    "we have the following limit theorem .    [ theoremqv2 ]",
    "assume that    * @xmath74 holds for some @xmath75,$ ] * @xmath102 , * @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "then for any @xmath105 , there exists a constant @xmath85 such that @xmath106 provided that @xmath107 .    in @xcite , the authors introduce another cross volatility estimation scheme for jump diffusion processes by using a threshold parameter to reduce the effect of large size jumps .",
    "furthermore , one can combine the threshold method with the bi - power method presented above to produce a more stable estimation ( see @xcite ) .    by following a similar argument as above",
    ", one can construct estimation schemes for eigenvalues of the cross volatility matrix of processes which are contaminated by microstructure noise ( see @xcite for some classes of real - time schemes for the estimation of volatility in the noisy case with / without jumps ) .",
    "the computational cost of the quadratic variation method is much less than that of fourier series method .",
    "indeed , the cost of computing of the quadratic variation method is of order @xmath108 while one of fourier series method is @xmath109 .",
    "we consider a stochastic volatility model of heston s type defined by @xmath110 for @xmath111 $ ] , where @xmath112 are constants , @xmath113 are positive ; @xmath114 are mutually independent standard brownian motions .",
    "the class of square - root diffusions @xmath115 with @xmath4 a standard one dimensional brownian motion , was studied in @xcite .",
    "the author showed that if parameters @xmath116 are positive , then @xmath117 will stay positive . and if one supposes further that @xmath118 , then @xmath117 is strictly positive for all @xmath60 with probability @xmath119 .    provided that processes @xmath120 s can be simulated at discretized time - point @xmath121 one can simulate @xmath0 by using a simple euler - maruyama s scheme as follows @xmath122 where @xmath123 s are independent standard normal distribution random variables .",
    "the simulation of @xmath120 s is more involved because the values of @xmath124 produced by euler - maruyama discretization may become negative .",
    "we will simulate @xmath120 s by sampling from the exact transition laws of the processes ( see @xcite ) .    in the following ,",
    "we choose @xmath125 we choose @xmath126 and @xmath17 to make simulation easier .",
    "based on the sample data of @xmath0 , we use both the quadratic variation and fourier series methods , as stated in the previous sections , to estimate the cross volatility matrices of @xmath0 as a function of time and after that we calculate the eigenvalues of each estimated matrix .",
    "in particular , since the volatility coefficients of @xmath0 satisfy assumption ( [ holder ] ) with @xmath127 , we choose @xmath128 for the quadratic variation scheme .",
    "besides , for the fourier series method , we calculate the fourier coefficients of the cross volatilities up to the nyquist frequency @xmath129 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we observe the mean square pathwise errors @xmath130 and @xmath131 defined as follows : suppose that for each @xmath132 , @xmath133 is an estimator of matrix @xmath134 .",
    "we denote by @xmath135 and @xmath136 the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath133 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath137 and @xmath138 the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath134 .",
    "then we measure the errors of the estimations on the whole paths by @xmath139 and @xmath140      the simulations show that the fourier series estimate does not work well near @xmath141 and @xmath142 . in order to have a better understanding of errors of each estimation methods at `` normal '' time",
    ", we eliminate @xmath143 percent of the estimated cross volatilities near the two end points @xmath141 and @xmath142 when we calculate the mean square pathwise errors for each symmetrization of the fourier series method and the quadratic variation method .",
    "the means of @xmath131 and @xmath130 of each method are showed in table [ errors1 ] ( note that in all tables we use @xmath144 for value less than @xmath145 ) . here qv and fs stand for quadratic variation and fourier series methods , respectively .",
    "fs@xmath97 , @xmath146 stand for fourier series estimation using smooth kernel with @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "figures [ f3_1 ] and [ f4_1 ] show the estimations of @xmath148 and @xmath149 during @xmath150 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",

    "its mean square pathwise error is strictly less than the ones of fourier series method .",
    "in addition , because the estimated cross volatility matrices using the quadratic variation method are always symmetric and non - negative definite , all of their eigenvalues are non - negative . finally , the computation time of the quadratic variation scheme is less than 1/100 of the fourier series scheme .",
    "in this section , we sketch the proofs of the main results in sections 2 and 3 . first we need the following auxiliary inequality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ hwlemma ] let @xmath154 be @xmath155 symmetric matrices , with eigenvalues @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath158      by using a similar argument as in the proof of theorem 3.4 ( @xcite ) , one can show that the following convergence in probability holds @xmath159 hence , one also has @xmath160 by applying lemma [ hwlemma ] , we get the desired result .      after some elementary calculations , one gets from lemma [ hwlemma ] that @xmath161 for all @xmath162 . on the other hand , it follows from proposition 3.3 ( @xcite ) that there exists a constant @xmath163 such that for all @xmath86 and all @xmath164 , one has @xmath165 which concludes theorem [ theoremqv1 ] .",
