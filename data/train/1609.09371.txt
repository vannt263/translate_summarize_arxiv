    "the @xmath0 production in nuclei has been intensively studied both experimentally  @xcite , as well as in theoretical analyses  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 nuclear transparency ratio measured in proton - induced and photoproduction experiments points to a large absorption in nuclei , consistent with widths about one order of magnitude larger than the one from its dominant decay to @xmath6 in vacuum . in ref .",
    "@xcite widths of @xmath7  mev are reported , even for densities of only half the normal nuclear - matter density . since the measurement of @xmath0 absorption with momentum binning has been made  @xcite , theoretical calculations of the momentum dependence of the @xmath0 self - energy",
    "are also of great interest .",
    "heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments , too , have been investigating the production of @xmath0 mesons  @xcite .",
    "they observed a deep sub - threshold @xmath0 production  @xcite . a possible explanation for this observations might be a change in the @xmath0-meson properties due to , for example , an attractive mass shift and an enhanced decay width arising from @xmath2 interactions .",
    "this is further supported by the large absorption seen in previous experiments .    due to its hidden strangeness content",
    ", the @xmath0 strongly couples to the @xmath6 system .",
    "therefore , also the in - medium dynamics are expected to be mainly governed by its decay into these light pseudoscalars .",
    "in fact , the direct coupling of the @xmath0 to the nucleon is ozi - forbidden .",
    "nevertheless , the above mentioned experimental results require medium effects larger than predicted by this kind of hadronic models , and additional interactions with the nuclear medium should be taken into account .",
    "therefore , it is important to study possible interaction and production mechanisms that may have been missed in theoretical analyses so far .    the @xmath0 self - energy originating from medium effects on the @xmath6 decay mode has been broadly studied in the past , both at zero and non - vanishing temperatures , using chiral - dynamic constraints on the pseudoscalar - meson interactions with nucleons and light mesons  @xcite . while the modification of the @xmath0 width is large , it does not entirely achieve to explain the experimental observation .    here",
    ", we revisit the @xmath0 self - energy in cold nuclear matter by analyzing the effect of direct @xmath0-nucleon interactions not previously considered .",
    "the hidden strangeness in the @xmath0 meson can be indirectly exchanged with the in - medium nucleon by the coupling to @xmath8 and @xmath9 pairs , without violation of the ozi rule .",
    "elastic @xmath0 scattering off the nucleon is then possible via @xmath10 loops , which can be studied in unitary coupled - channel approaches . in these models ,",
    "several broad @xmath3 states are dynamically generated around energies close to the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "furthermore , they have a non - negligible coupling to this channel , therefore being good candidates for the enhancement of the @xmath0 self - energy .",
    "we explore whether these resonant @xmath2 interactions can fill in for the missing absorption pointed out by nuclear production experiments .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly show the formalism for the calculation of the @xmath0 self - energy with @xmath2-interaction mechanisms .",
    "we present and discuss our results for the @xmath0 nuclear optical potential and spectral function in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "since the @xmath6-cloud contributions to the @xmath0-meson self - energy have already been thoroughly studied in literature , here we want to concentrate on the novel in - medium processes , namely the presence of resonances in the @xmath2 scattering amplitude in the vicinity of the @xmath2 threshold . to estimate the uncertainties , we compare two approaches to this implementation , since they differ in size and energy dependence : in refs .",
    "@xcite , vector mesons are introduced through the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) approach , where the tree level vector - meson nucleon scattering amplitudes are obtained from a vector - meson exchange mechanism ; in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is obtained within an su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry extension of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy is obtained by integrating the scattering amplitude @xmath11 over the nucleon fermi distribution , @xmath12 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the total energy and momentum of the @xmath2 pair in the nuclear - matter rest frame .",
    "the scattering amplitude in the two models has to be calculated by solving the coupled - channel on - shell bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath15^{-1 } v$ ]",
    ". for further definitions , refer to our work in ref .",
    "@xcite . additionally , we took into account the modifications of @xmath16 from pauli blocking .",

    "the fermi momentum is given in terms of the nuclear - matter density @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "we leave the consideration of additional sources of medium effects , such as baryon binding potentials and the self - consistent dressing of the @xmath0 propagator within the @xmath2 loop function , to future works .",
    "optical potential as a function of the @xmath0 momentum at normal matter density .",

    "[ fig : vopt ] , we show the @xmath0 nuclear optical potential at normal nuclear density , as a function of the @xmath0 momentum . we take into account the contributions from the @xmath6-cloud and the @xmath2 interactions .",
    "these two mechanisms give rise to imaginary parts  related to the width enhancement  of the same order of magnitude .",
    "concerning the @xmath2 interactions , the magnitude at zero momentum is larger in the su(6 ) than in the hls model .",
    "nevertheless , even the latter is substantial for typical production - experiment momenta around @xmath24 .",
    "the real part , which can be connected to a mass shift , is of importance only when calculated in the su(6 ) approach .    on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vopt ] , we depict the spectral function of an off - shell @xmath0 meson at vanishing momentum and normal density , as a function of its energy .",
    "again , the case where the @xmath6 self - energy alone is considered is compared with the cumulative contribution of both the @xmath6 cloud and the @xmath2 interactions .",
    "the latter are shown in the hls approach , as well as in the su(6 ) model .",
    "for reference , the @xmath0 spectral function in vacuum is shown , too . as has been shown in other works , the effects of the @xmath6 cloud lead to a broadening of the @xmath0 spectral function , and to an enhancement of the low - energy tail in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the mass shift is negligible .",
    "when adding the @xmath2-interaction contributions , there is an increase of the broadening , and an enhancement of the low - energy tail .",
    "furthermore , a second shoulder above the @xmath0 mass appears due to the excitation of resonance - hole modes . in the su(6 )",
    "model , the @xmath0 quasi - particle peak is shifted to lower energies in agreement with the observed attractive optical potential .    in summary ,",
    "the absorption of the @xmath0 meson in matter suffers a strong and energy - dependent enhancement from resonant @xmath2 interactions .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained in nuclear production experiments . as a next step ,",
    "it is important to implement this updated self - energy in order to analyse the nuclear transparency ratio for different nuclei , and as function of @xmath0 momenta .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 production reaction in nuclei could be used to check the validity of the hls and su(6 ) models , due to their differing results .",
