    "one of the prime objectives of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the search for spin - zero particles which remain in the physical spectrum after the elementary - particle masses have been generated through the higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "should the world be supersymmetric , then the higgs sector is more complicated than in the standard model ( sm ) , which predicts just one scalar higgs boson .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) consists of a two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) and accommodates five physical higgs bosons : the neutral cp - even @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons , the neutral cp - odd @xmath7 boson , and the charged @xmath8-boson pair . at the tree level , the mssm higgs sector has two free parameters , which are usually taken to be the mass @xmath9 of the @xmath7 boson and the ratio @xmath10 of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath8 bosons would prove wrong the sm and , at the same time , give strong support to the mssm .",
    "the logistics of the @xmath8-boson search at the lhc may be summarized as follows . for @xmath8-boson masses @xmath11 ,",

    "in contrast to the sm top - quark events , this signature violates lepton universality , a criterion which is routinely applied in ongoing @xmath8-boson searches at the fermilab @xmath16 collider tevatron @xcite . for larger values of @xmath17 , the most copious sources of @xmath8 bosons are provided by @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the preferred decay channel is then @xmath21 , independently of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative is to produce @xmath8 bosons in association with @xmath22 bosons , so that the leptonic decays of the latter may serve as a trigger for the @xmath8-boson search .",
    "the dominant subprocesses of @xmath23 associated production are @xmath24 at the tree level and @xmath25 at one loop , which were investigated for @xmath26 and small values of @xmath2 ( @xmath27 ) in ref .",

    "although the cross section of @xmath1 fusion is suppressed by two powers of @xmath35 relative to the one of @xmath0 annihilation , it is expected to yield a comparable contribution at multi - tev hadron colliders , due to the overwhelming gluon luminosity . in the 2hdm , @xmath1 fusion",

    ", it should be noted that the treatment of bottom as an active flavour inside the colliding hadrons leads to an effective description , which comprises contributions from the higher - order subprocesses @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "the number of parameters is to embed the mssm into a grand unified theory ( gut ) , e.g. , a suitable supergravity ( sugra ) model , in such a way that it is recovered in the low - energy limit .",
    "the mssm thus constrained is described by the following parameters at the gut scale , which come in addition to @xmath2 and @xmath40 : the universal sfermion mass , @xmath41 ; the universal gaugino mass , @xmath42 ; the trilinear higgs - sfermion coupling , @xmath43 ; the bilinear higgs coupling , @xmath44 ; and the higgs - higgsino mass parameter , @xmath45 .",

    "<S> we study the pair production of charged higgs bosons at the cern large hadron collider in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model . we compare the contributions due to @xmath0 annihilation at the tree level and @xmath1 fusion , which proceeds at one loop . at small or large values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> production proceeds dominantly via @xmath4 annihilation , due to feynman diagrams involving neutral cp - even higgs bosons and top quarks , which come in addition to the usually considered drell - yan diagrams . in the case of @xmath1 fusion </S>",
    "<S> , the squark loop contributions may considerably enhance the well - known quark loop contributions .    </S>",
