    "@xcite clearly demonstrate that the feh feature heavily depends on the surface gravity with cool dwarf stars possessing the strongest feh features .",

    "@xcite also suggested that the discrepancy may be due to cool star spots or strong chromospheric activity , but suggested that clear evidence in support of either scenario did not exist .",
    "therefore , basri et al .  concluded that the lower surface gravity of the `` puffed - up '' t tauri star photospheres may lead to a strengthening of the tio band , resulting in a cooler spectral type relative to that determined by the metallic lines .",
    "the spex spectral library also includes spectral standards for giant stars over the spectral range presented in figure [ fig : fullspec ] ; these standards enable us to test the suggestion that the `` puffed - up '' photospheres affect the spectral typing . in other words , do warm  puffed - up \" or giant stars have tio bands in the ir with strengths comparable to those observed in dq  tau ? in figure [ fig : giants ] , we compare two dereddened dq  tau spectra to the spectra of giant stars in a spectral type range similar to those presented in figure [ fig : fullspec ] . by visual inspection ,",

    "however , what is most telling about the lack of sensitivity of the ir spectral type on @xmath70 is the strength of the feh absorption feature at 0.99  @xmath0 m .",
    "in contrast to the synthetic spectra of the 4500  k stars , the spectra of the 3500  k stars both possess feh , a result of the temperature sensitivity of this feature",
    ". however , the two stars with different surface gravities have similarly strong feh features both of which are clearly weaker than the feh in the spectrum of dq  tau . according to the study of @xcite ,",
    "feh is strongest in the spectra of the coolest , dwarf stars ( lowest temperature , highest surface gravity ) .",
    "according to the comparison made in figure  [ fig : tio_g ] , the higher surface gravity of the @xmath65 = 4.5 is not enough to account for the strength of the feh feature .",
    "figure  [ fig : tio_g ] also demonstrates that a photospheric temperature of 3500  k is not _",
    "low enough _ to produce an feh feature as strong as is observed in dq  tau .",
    "in order to simultaneously fit the tio features and the feh feature in dq tau , a synthetic spectrum with a lower photospheric temperature ( cooler than an m2 ) and/or a slightly higher surface gravity ( greater than an m2iii ) is required .",
    "therefore , we conclude that strengths of both the feh and the tio features indicate that a low surface gravity associated with the `` puffed up '' envelopes of contracting ttss can not account for the discrepancy between the infrared and optical spectral types for such sources .                  using infrared measurements , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that weak - line or non - accreting ttss appear brighter at longer wavelengths than main - sequence stars of the same spectral types .",
    "one result of this color anomaly is that @xmath61 values determined from ir photometry will be larger than those determined from optical photometry . @xcite and @xcite find systematically larger values of @xmath61 for both non - accreting and accreting ttss as compared to values determined from optical wavelengths . gullbring et al .",

    "@xmath61 would drastically affect the shape of the infrared continuum , forcing it to appear as a much earlier type star .",
    "@xcite suggest that very large axisymmetric spots may be responsible for the color anomalies and differences in values of @xmath61 .",
    "a defining characteristic of ttss is their irregular photometric variability @xcite , with one of the well - established sources of variability being the rotation and evolution of large , cool star spots on their surfaces @xcite .",
    "the spot temperatures and fractional coverage of the stellar surfaces in ttss are shown to be similar to those found on rs cvn stars @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been committed to understanding the sizes and temperatures of spots on the surfaces of magnetically active stars , perhaps , more so than have been carried out for ttss .",
    "spot sizes , temperatures , and locations are deduced from photometric light - curve modeling and spectral line diagnostics ( i.e. , doppler imaging ; * ? ? ?",
    "relying on the fact that spots on active , low surface gravity stars are similar to those on ttss , we discuss findings from a few studies of the tio molecular bands in the photospheres of ttss and rs cvn stars that are relevant for the analysis we perform below .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used high - resolution spectroscopy of the tio bands in the spectra of several rs cvn - type stars to constrain the spot and non - spot surface temperatures as well as the spot sizes . in these three papers ,",
    "the authors developed a technique for fitting the rs  cvn spectra using inactive g and k stars as spectral standards for the non - spotted photosphere and inactive m standards for the spots .",
    "for late - type active stars , @xcite found spot temperatures between 3400 and 3900  k and spot filling factors between 0.1 and 0.5 ( 10% and 50% fractional coverage , respectively ) , in good agreement with photometric light - curve modeling .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first showed that variations in the strengths of the tio bands near 7100    correlated with the existence , rotation , and evolution of cool star spots on the surfaces of ttss . in light of this correlation , the anomalous strengths of both the tio and feh absorption features in the spectra of dq  tau may strongly suggest the presence of cool spots on the surfaces of the dq  tau companions @xcite .",
    "inspired by the evidence pointing towards the contribution of cool spots to the spectral type discrepancy , the inability of surface gravity effects to reproduce the strengths of the tio and feh features , and the spectral fitting technique developed by @xcite , we attempted to fit the tio features at 0.85 and 0.88  @xmath0 m and the feh feature at 0.99  @xmath0 m to determine if cool spots could be responsible for the spectral type discrepancy observed for dq  tau .",
    "modeling of the entire near - ir spectra would require a disk model to account for the infrared excess emission beyond 1  @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , we focus on fitting the dq  tau spectra in the spectral window from 0.8 to 1.0  @xmath0 m and reserve the inclusion of disk models and associated parameters to future study .    main - sequence spectral standards from the spex library were used to construct composite spectra , representative of spotted stars .",
    "we chose m0v and m1v standard spectra to represent the photosphere based on optically - derived spectral types .",
    "m6v and m7v standards were chosen to represent the spot temperatures of 3050  k and 2650  k , respectively .",
    "composite spectra were calculated for six spot filling factors ( @xmath75@xmath20.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 ) .",
    "the spot filling factors weighted the contributions of the spectra produced by the spots to the final composite spectra . a goodness - of - fit to the observed dq  tau spectrum was determined by finding the composite spectrum with the minimum @xmath60-value for the two different photosphere and spot temperatures , six spot filling factors , and two of the published values of @xmath61 : 0.97 and 2.13 .",
    "the best fits to the tio features and the spectral shape between 0.8 and 1.0  @xmath0 m was given by an m1v photosphere ( m1v@xmath76 ) and a spot temperature of 3050  k ( m6v@xmath77 ) , with spot filling factors , @xmath75  =  0.4 and  0.5 , and @xmath61  =  0.97 ( see figures  [ fig : m6v_40 ] and [ fig : m6v_50 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath60-values , which are calculated from the residuals for all of the data points in the spectral window , presented in table  [ tbl : chisq ] indicate that the m0v@xmath76+m6v@xmath77 model with @xmath75  =  0.6 is the best fit .",
    "while the fit of the spectral shape is slightly better , the fit to the feh feature is extremely poor .",
    "therefore , we dismiss this model as the best overall fit to the dq  tau spectrum .",
    "we also take the m1v@xmath76+m6v@xmath77 model with @xmath75  =  0.4 to be a slightly better fit than the @xmath78  =  0.5 model based on the fitting of the feh feature .",
    "the feh feature is best fit by the smaller spot size , @xmath75  =  0.3 for the m1v@xmath76+m6v@xmath77 model . based on the work of @xcite , we can interpret this discrepancy between fits to the tio and the feh as a combination of the strict low temperature sensitivity of the feh feature combined with its dependence on @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , both a higher spot temperature and/or a smaller @xmath65 for the model star could account for the spot size discrepancy .",
    "this is observed in the models with the hotter m0v photosphere as the larger spot size @xmath75  =  0.4 produces the best fit to the feh feature .",
    "the atomic absorption features of na  ii and ca  ii infrared triplet are much weaker in the best - fit models as demonstrated by the residuals in figures  [ fig : m6v_40 ] and [ fig : m6v_50 ] .",
    "the ca  ii absorption lines in the spectrum of dq  tau are likely filled in partially by ca  ii emission related to the accretion activity in the system as well as continuum veiling .",
    "the na  ii features though less affected by accretion activity , will also be affected by any veiling at these shorter wavelengths .",
    "we discuss difficulties associated with measuring veiling in this region of the spectrum in the following section .    in determining the significance of the fits ,",
    "it is also important to note that for the larger value of @xmath61  =  2.13 , the tio bands and overall spectral shape in the 0.8 - 1.0  @xmath0 m window were fit reasonably well by models with the smallest spot filling factor of 0.1 ( see figure  [ fig : m6v_10 ] ) .",
    "however , the poor fit at the shortest wavelengths in this spectral region as well as the poor approximation of the feh band by the smaller spot size result in the comparatively large @xmath60-values .",
    "even though the @xmath60-values steadily decrease with spot size for both m1v@xmath76 models , the poor approximation of the feh feature leads us to conclude that spots with @xmath75  @xmath63  0.1 are not viable models for dq  tau .",

    "<S> we also explore the optical / infrared spectral type mismatch previously observed for t tauri stars and successfully model the shape of the spectra from 0.8 to 1.0 @xmath0 m and the strengths of the tio and feh bands as manifestations of large cool spots on the surfaces of the stellar companions in dq tau . </S>",
    "<S> these findings illustrate that a complete model of near - infrared spectra of many t tauri stars must include parameters for spot filling factors and temperatures . </S>"
