    "by mapping the spatial distribution of galaxies , we can determine the intrinsic scales on which galaxies cluster , from poor groups through rich clusters to superclusters .",
    "quantifying the abundance of these clusterings and their evolution with time should provide important constraints on the multifarious cosmological models ( liddle et al.1996 ) . in the local universe",
    ", extensive redshift surveys have been undertaken to map the distribution of galaxies to @xmath6 that reach to a redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "such surveys have uncovered coherent structures that extend over many tens of megaparsecs , such as the perseus - pisces filament ( giovanelli and haynes 1993 ) or the sheet - like `` great wall '' ( geller and huchra 1989 ) .",
    "these structures appear to be common in other and even deeper ( @xmath8 ) surveys that extend beyond redshifts @xmath9 ( landy et al .",
    "1996 , willmer et al .",
    "1996 ) .    at even fainter magnitudes",
    ", redshift surveys have been undertaken to a limit of @xmath10 ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 , glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 , lilly et al .",
    "because of the long exposures required to reach such faint limits , these surveys have been restricted to a few pointings that cover tiny regions of sky , typically @xmath11 10 arcmin in diameter .",
    "consequently , while large over - densities of galaxies are visible in the deep redshift surveys ( broadhurst et al .  1990 , le fevre et al .  1994 ,",
    "cohen et al .  1996 ) , the angular distribution of these structures and , therefore , their transverse spatial extent , have yet to be well studied .    in this letter",
    "we consider the distribution of galaxies in the direction of selected area 68 ( kron 1980 ) .",
    "we identify this region as a potential site of an intermediate redshift supercluster because of the coherent distribution of very red galaxies , estimated to be at @xmath12 , found by koo ( 1985 ) and the presence of two x - ray clusters at the same redshift ( hughes et al .",
    "the over - density of galaxies is quantified using a small sample of spectroscopic redshifts in @xmath13 and then improved using a larger sample of photometric redshifts in @xmath14 .",
    "the coincidence of this structure with the position and orientation of three x - ray clusters is discussed in @xmath15 .",
    "finally we show that the galaxies and clusters are consistent with a `` great wall''-like supercluster , at @xmath0 , that is almost edge - on with respect to the line of sight . for this letter",
    "we assume an h@xmath16 km s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 and @xmath17 cosmology ; at redshift @xmath3 , the lookback time is nearly half the age of the universe and one degree spans @xmath18 h@xmath4mpc .",
    "to determine if there exist intermediate redshift counterparts to the locally detected superclusters , we consider the spectroscopic and photometric galaxy catalog of koo and kron ( kron 1980 , koo 1986 , munn et al .",
    "1996 ) in the direction of selected area 68 ( 00@xmath1914@xmath20 + 15@xmath230@xmath20 ) .",
    "these data comprise a total of 1750 galaxies , @xmath21 , with multicolor photometry in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 passbands . of these galaxies 286",
    "have spectroscopically measured redshifts .    in fig 1",
    "we show the redshift distribution of the spectroscopic sample of galaxies .",
    "the most striking features of this redshift distribution are the regular set of peaks .",
    "such over - densities have been interpreted as the intersection of the narrow pencil beam surveys with large - scale coherent structures in the galaxy distribution ( broadhurst et al.1990 , szalay et al .",
    "1991 , le fevre et al .",
    "1994 , cohen et al.1996 ) . for later discussions ,",
    "we consider only the spatial and redshift distribution of those galaxies lying between @xmath24 .    to test whether this feature , at @xmath25 , represents a significant perturbation from number of galaxies expected from an unclustered distribution of galaxies , we calculate the selection function for the spectroscopic sample of galaxies . as the spectroscopic sample",
    "is not formally magnitude limited we must calculate the expected redshift distribution using the models of gronwall and koo ( 1995 ) .",
    "these models were derived to match the observed redshift distribution of sa68 to a limit of b@xmath26 .",
    "taking the observed @xmath27 magnitude distribution of the spectroscopic galaxy sample we construct the expected _ dn / dz _ ( the solid line in fig 1 ) .",
    "the expectation value for the number of galaxies with @xmath28 is 3.54 .    to account for a clustered distribution",
    "we calculate the variance of the expectation value by integrating the local spatial correlation function , @xmath29 , over this redshift volume . assuming a projected area of 706 arcmin@xmath30 for sa68 we estimate the variance in the expectation value to be 3.7 . it should be noted that this is a conservative value ( an upper limit ) as we assume no evolution of the spatial correlation function , with redshift .",
    "we would , therefore , expect to detect @xmath31 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts within the redshift range @xmath32 .",
    "the observed number of galaxies in this redshift peak is 14 , representing a factor of 4 over the unclustered expectation value .",
    "fitting a gaussian to the spectroscopic redshifts we determine the dispersion of the redshift distribution to be 0.0083 .",
    "if the dispersion in redshift were due to the internal velocity of a cluster this would equate to a velocity dispersion of @xmath33 km s@xmath4  far in excess of local observations ( zabludoff et al .",
    "1993 , collins et al.1995 ) .",
    "the radial distance corresponding to the fwhm of the redshift distribution is then 31 h@xmath4mpc .    the projected angular distribution of the spectroscopic sample of galaxies within this redshift range is shown in fig 2a .",
    "they form a linear structure passing from the south - west of the sa68 field through to the north - east .",
    "the angular distribution extends to the limits of the survey field . from the second moments of the galaxy distribution we find that this structure can be represented by an ellipse with a position angle oriented 29@xmath2 east of north and centered on 00@xmath3414@xmath2040 + 15@xmath3533@xmath2058 ( b1950 ) .    while the number of galaxies with observed spectroscopic redshifts is small we can estimate whether they are consistent with a uniform distribution of galaxies across the sa68 survey field",
    "we do this by applying a 2 dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( peacock 1983 , fasano and franceschini 1987 ) . for a sample size of 14 , the probability that the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with a uniform distribution",
    "is only 15% .",
    "since the spectroscopic sample is so small , we adopt another technique to increase the redshift sample , namely we estimate the redshift of a galaxy from its broadband magnitudes . the effectiveness of this technique for deriving galaxy redshifts to the limit of our photometric data has been demonstrated by connolly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . by fitting the @xmath36 magnitudes with a second order relation to the spectroscopic redshifts",
    ", redshifts can be estimated to an accuracy of @xmath37 .",
    "we calculate the photometric redshift relation for the galaxies in the photometric sample using the prescription given by connolly et al.(1995 ) . comparing those galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with their estimated photometric redshifts we derive a dispersion in the relation of @xmath38 .",
    "we select a 1 @xmath39 range around the peak in the spectroscopic redshift distribution . in fig 2b",
    "we show the distribution of the 146 galaxies within the redshift range @xmath40 .",
    "these data have been smoothed with a kernel of diameter 2.5 arcmin ( 0.55 h@xmath4mpc at @xmath0 ; equivalent to the core diameter of a king cluster profile ) .",
    "the galaxy distribution is again seen to form a coherent linear structure passing from the south - west to the north - east of sa68 .",
    "the second moments of the distribution of galaxies gives a position angle of 40.3@xmath2 centered on 00@xmath3414@xmath4141 + 15@xmath3537@xmath2016 .",
    "clearly this represents an underestimate of the over - density of galaxies within the supercluster ( due to the contamination from foreground and background galaxies ) .",
    "the two - dimensional kolomogorov - smirnov test yields only a 2% probability that the photometric - redshift sample is drawn from a uniform distribution",
    ". a comparison of the angular distributions of those galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with those from the photometric redshift sample shows that the probability that they are drawn from _",
    "different _ intrinsic populations is only 45% ( i.e.less than a one sigma deviation ) .",
    "the angular distribution of the spectroscopic and photometric redshift samples , therefore , display the same large - scale clustering properties .",
    "they show a linear structure of at least 0.5 degrees in extent ( equivalent to 6.5 h@xmath4mpc  at @xmath0 ) .",
    "just beyond half a degree from the center of sa68 lies the x - ray luminous cluster cl0016 + 16 at a redshift of @xmath42 ( koo 1981 , see fig 2 ) , which was the target of one of the deepest rosat pspc pointed observations ( hughes et al .",

    "in addition to cl0016 + 16 ( 00@xmath3418@xmath4433.2 + 16@xmath3526@xmath2018 ) and rx j0018.3 + 1618 ( 00@xmath3418@xmath4516.8 + 16@xmath3517@xmath2045 , hughes et al .",
    "1995 ) - which both satisfy these criteria - we have discovered a further such x - ray source ; rx j0018.8 + 1602 ( 00@xmath3418@xmath4545.5 + 16@xmath3501@xmath2041 ) .",
    "this source lies 25 arcmins from the center of the pspc pointing and is within 1 arcmin of the radio galaxy 54w084 ( neff et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the pspc x - ray contours of rx j0018.8 + 1602 are overlaid on a b@xmath46 photographic plate ( # 1286 ) observed by r. kron with the kpno 4 m telescope .",
    "the peak in the x - ray photon distribution is coincident with an over - density of faint , b@xmath47 , galaxies in the optical data .",
    "the color of the central optical galaxy is consistent with that of an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.5 . within the x - ray contours",
    "lies the radio galaxy 54w084 at a redshift of @xmath48 ( r. windhorst , private communication ) ; indicated by an arrow in fig 3 . if we assume a redshift of 0.544 , rx j0018.8 + 1602 has a luminosity in the 0.5002.0 kev energy range of 4.25@xmath49 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "this compares with an x - ray luminosity of 2.5@xmath50 ergs s@xmath4 measured by hughes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the cluster rx j0018.3 + 1618 .",
    "the rosat pspc spectrum of rx j0018.3 + 1618 is consistent with a thermal plasma . assuming a raymond - smith model with heavy metal abundance of 0.3 solar and the galactic n@xmath51 value at the cluster position , the temperature of the plasma is @xmath52 .",
    "this source has also been detected by asca and a preliminary analysis shows a spectrum consistent that derived from the rosat data .",
    "this is indicative of an intermediate redshift x - ray cool cluster of galaxies .",
    "the redshifts of cl0016 + 16 and rx j0018.3 + 1618 are 0.5455 and 0.5506 respectively .",
    "all three x - ray clusters are , therefore , consistent with the redshift distribution observed in sa68 .",
    "cl0016 + 16 and rx j0018.3 + 1618 have been suggested to be a bound system and possibly linked with the over - density of red galaxies in sa68 found by koo ( hughes et al .",
    "below we show in fact that the space distribution of the three clusters and those galaxies in sa68 with spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with a supercluster viewed edge on with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the orientation of clusters of galaxies has been suggested as a means of identifying coherent large scale structures ( bingelli 1982 ) .",
    "results derived from the optical distribution of galaxies remain inconclusive with west ( 1989 ) finding evidence for a correlation between cluster position angles on scales of up to 45 h@xmath4mpc  while struble and peebles ( 1985 ) , using similar data , find no significant signal .",
    "much of these uncertainties arise from the difficulty in separating cluster galaxies from contamination due to background sources ( especially in the outer regions of a cluster ) . determining the orientation of a cluster from the distribution of its x - ray emitting gas",
    "provides a more objective measure ( ulmer et al .",
    "1989 ) since the gas better traces the cluster potential .",
    "the position angles of the three x - ray sources were determined from the second moments of the outer isophotes of the x - ray photon distribution .",
    "the derived values for cl0016 + 16 , rx j0018.3 + 1618 and rx",
    "j0018.8 + 1602 were 39@xmath2 , 29@xmath2 and 30@xmath2 east of north respectively .",
    "all three sources are , therefore , aligned with the galaxy distribution of sa68 . as has been noted by bond et al .",
    "( 1996 ) the signature of superclustering will be strongest when the individual clusters are aligned .",
    "combining the optical and x - ray data we have strong evidence for a coherent structure , at a redshift of @xmath0 , extending about one degree across the sky from the survey field sa68 through the cluster cl0016 + 16 . at this redshift",
    ", this translates to a tangential size of 12 h@xmath4mpc , a radial depth of 31 h@xmath4mpcand a `` thickness '' of 4 h@xmath4mpc .",
    "the positions of the galaxies and clusters within this volume are not randomly distributed but appear to lie in a planar distribution ( i.e.their redshifts and angular distribution are strongly correlated ) .    to determine the true geometry of the galaxy distribution , i.e.whether it is better represented by an extended filament or a sheet of galaxies , we fit a two dimensional surface to the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the redshifts of the galaxies in sa68 and the three clusters are transformed to comoving distance and treated as independent points , we do not weight the cluster redshifts by the number of galaxies that have spectroscopic observations . the best fit to these data is a plane with an orientation 40@xmath54 east of north and an angle 12@xmath55 from the line of sight .",
    "given that the redshift dispersion of the galaxies exceeds that expected for a cluster , we suggest that the structure we are observing is a sheet of galaxies oriented almost orthogonally to our line of sight .    as noted in 3 .",
    "the dispersion in the photometric - redshift relation results in a dilution of the supercluster due to contamination by foreground and background galaxies .",
    "we can not , therefore , map the full three - dimensional distribution of the supercluster .",
    "we can , however , determine whether the galaxy distribution is comparable to that observed in the local universe ( i.e.  if a structure similar to the `` great wall '' were to exist at @xmath0 what would its signature be ) .",
    "if we correct for the orientation of the galaxy distribution and determine the width orthogonal to the plane of the supercluster we derive a dispersion of 433@xmath56 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the mean value of 300 km s@xmath4  determined by ramella et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the `` great wall '' .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that 30% of the galaxies within the redshift range @xmath57 are indeed members of the supercluster , as suggested by the results of de lapparent et al .",
    "( 1991 ) from their analysis of the cfa redshift survey , we can estimate the surface density of the galaxies in the supercluster .",
    "allowing for an inclination angle of 10 degrees to the line of sight and a luminosity distance of 1837 h@xmath4mpc we estimate the surface density of galaxies to be approximately 0.6 h@xmath30 mpc@xmath58 .",
    "this is only slightly higher than the values of 0.250.4 h@xmath30 mpc@xmath58 determined for the individual slices in the cfa redshift survey ( de lapparent et al .",
    "it would appear , therefore , that we have identified an intermediate redshift counterpart to the sheet - like supercluster structures observed in redshift surveys of the local universe .",
    "clearly the available data , while providing tantalizing evidence for large scale clustering at intermediate redshifts , do not map the full extent of this supercluster . the over - density in the spectroscopic redshifts encompasses the full extent of the survey field sa68 . to determine the tangential distribution of galaxies at a redshift of 0.54 and , therefore , the true size of this supercluster we are engaged in followup photometric and spectroscopic observations of this region .",
