    "quantum theory has the remarkable feature that certain dynamical degrees of freedom may become `` slaved '' and thus lose their autonomous status .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is a separation , both in space and time , into slow and fast degrees of freedom .",
    "the fast modes quickly adapt to the slow modes which in turn are governed by a suitable effective hamiltonian .",
    "this mechanism is called adiabatic decoupling .    as paradigm we mention the motion of nuclei .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom rapidly adjust to the state of lowest energy at given positions of the nuclei and the electronic energy band serves as effective potential in the hamiltonian for the nuclei .",
    "this born - oppenheimer approximation is the basis for the dynamics of molecules and , as a consequence , also for the microscopic theory of classical fluids .",
    "there are many other examples of a similar structure .",
    "a very widely studied case are electrons moving in the periodic crystal potential , which defines the short scale .",
    "the envelope of the electronic wave function is governed by an effective hamiltonian obtained from the peierls substitution , in which the band energy is taken as effective kinetic energy . for an electron coupled to the quantized radiation field",
    "the photons are the fast degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the electron is governed by an effective hamiltonian accounting for spin precession . these and other systems have been studied extensively by model specific approximate methods without realizing that they share a common structure .",
    "in fact , all the examples given can be molded into the generic form @xmath5 here @xmath1 is an operator - valued function on the classical phase space @xmath6 of the slow degrees of freedom with @xmath7 a position like and @xmath8 a momentum like variable .",
    "@xmath1 is self - adjoint and acts on the hilbert space @xmath9 of  internal \" fast degrees of freedom .",
    "after quantization @xmath10 becomes the hamiltonian of our system . to properly define it one has to specify an ordering of the operators @xmath11 , for which we will adopt the weyl quantization rule as to be explained in full detail in the appendix",
    "@xmath12 is a wave function on @xmath13 with values in @xmath14 .",
    "thus the quantum mechanical hilbert space of states is @xmath15 .",
    "finally @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter which controls the scale separation , @xmath16 .",
    "examples will be given in due course and we only remark that , in general , ( [ a ] ) is already the result of a proper identification of the slow degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , in nonrelativistic qed @xmath7 stands for the position of the electron , whereas @xmath8 is the total momentum of the electron and photons . for an electron in a periodic potential ( [ a ] )",
    "is the hamiltonian in the crystal momentum basis with @xmath17 standing for the bloch momentum @xmath18 in the first brillouin zone , see @xcite .",
    "our goal is to construct approximate solutions to ( [ a ] ) , a task which we divide into four steps .    *",
    "( i ) almost invariant subspace . *",
    "the adiabatic decoupling can be traced to a spectral property of @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed , and it can be proved in many particular cases , that for each @xmath19 the spectrum , @xmath20 , of @xmath1 can be decomposed into a ",
    "relevant \" part @xmath21 and a remainder in such a way that the relevant energy band @xmath22 is separated from the remainder @xmath23 by a gap , i.e. by a corridor of finite width . in many cases of interest",
    "the relevant part of the spectrum consists of a single , possibly degenerate eigenvalue and the relevant energy band is the graph of a smooth function .",
    "of course , a given @xmath1 could have several such relevant energy bands and we suppose one of them to be singled out , e.g. , through the initial condition . to the relevant energy band of @xmath24 one associates a subspace @xmath25 of @xmath26 with the property that if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 up to an error which is smaller than any power of @xmath3 . for this reason @xmath25",
    "is called an almost invariant subspace . if @xmath29 denotes the weyl quantization of @xmath24 , then @xmath30={\\mathcal{o}}({\\varepsilon}^\\infty)$ ] , where @xmath31 is the orthogonal projector onto the closed subspace @xmath25 . of course",
    ", in practice , approximations to @xmath31 are constructed , for which at order @xmath32 the error is @xmath33 .    *",
    "( ii ) reference hilbert space . * clearly , on @xmath25 the dynamics is generated by the diagonal hamiltonian @xmath34 , up to @xmath35 . while properly defined , for a further analysis of the effective dynamics inside @xmath25 a representation in terms of adapted coordinates for the slow degrees of freedom",
    "is more powerful .",
    "we call the corresponding hilbert space @xmath36 the reference space . by definition @xmath37",
    "is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the next task is thus to construct a linear map @xmath38 , which is unitary in the sense that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    *",
    "( iii ) effective hamiltonian . *",
    "the effective hamiltonian is defined through @xmath41 as operator on @xmath37 .",
    "it is unitarily equivalent to the diagonal hamiltonian , but acts on a simpler space .",
    "while @xmath42 is still a rather abstract object , it can be expanded in powers of @xmath3 , which is the adiabatic perturbation theory of the title .",
    "already the lowest order approximations provide a wealth of information on the motion of the slow degrees of freedom .    *",
    "( iv ) semiclassical limit .",
    "* in many applications of interest the effective hamiltonian is of a form which allows for a semiclassical analysis .",
    "the simplest situation is a relevant band which consist only of a single , possibly degenerate , eigenvalue .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian has a scalar principle symbol and the semiclassical analysis is straightforward .",
    "we are certainly not the first ones to investigate approximate solutions to ( [ a ] ) and we have to explain which parts of the program outlined above have been achieved before and which parts are our novel contribution .",
    "in addition there have been other approaches to ( [ a ] ) on which we briefly comment below .    to our knowledge , the notion `` almost invariant subspace '' was first coined by nenciu @xcite in the context of gauge invariant perturbation theory . in the context of space - adiabatic problems brummelhuis and nourrigat @xcite",
    "construct @xmath31 for the particular case of the dirac equation and martinez and sordoni @xcite based on @xcite consider born - oppenheimer type hamiltonians .",
    "the general scheme for the construction of @xmath31 is sketched in nenciu and sordoni @xcite and applied to the matrix - valued klein - gordon equation .",
    "our construction is based on the one in @xcite , but differs in a few technical details .    as in the case of @xmath31",
    "we construct the unitary @xmath43 in several steps .",
    "first we compute order by order the formal symbol of @xmath43 , which , after quantization , gives rise to an `` almost unitary '' operator .",
    "finally the almost unitary is modified to yield a true unitary exactly intertwining @xmath25 and @xmath37 .",
    "our method is specifically designed to deal also with problems as the dirac equation and the bloch electron with external magnetic fields , where the projector @xmath31 has no limit for @xmath44 , see remark  [ nagyrem ] . while the specific application and the proof are new , the general idea to construct a pseudodifferential operator which is almost unitary and diagonalizes a given pseudodifferential operator has a long tradition , @xcite section  7 and references therein , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the method of successive diagonalization is also prominent in the physics literature , for example @xcite in the derivation of the pauli equation and its corrections , @xcite for periodic schrdinger operators , @xcite for the dirac equation , @xcite for born - oppenheimer type hamiltonians .",
    "our central result is the expansion of the effective hamiltonian @xmath42 .",
    "we provide a scheme which is applicable in general and work out explicitly the expansion as @xmath45 . in particular , for a relevant band consisting of a single eigenvalue , @xmath46 is the peierls substitution and @xmath47 contains among other things the information on geometric phases .    since @xmath42 has , in general , a matrix - valued symbol , we discuss and apply some results on the semiclassical limit for matrix - pseudodifferential operators with scalar principal symbol .",
    "we include this part to make the paper self - contained and to demonstrate that in many cases of interest the motion of the slow degrees of freedom can be approximately described through the appropriate classical hamiltonian flow .",
    "surely the reader will have noticed that our program makes no mention of the initial conditions for ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the reason is simply that our estimates are uniform on @xmath25 , respectively on @xmath37 .",
    "physically this partial independence from the initial conditions is most welcome , because in general they can not be controlled so easily .",
    "on the other hand , in the approach of hagedorn and joye @xcite one constructs for a specific @xmath3-dependent @xmath48 the wave packet @xmath49 , which solves ( [ a ] ) up to @xmath35 or even @xmath50 .",
    "hagedorn and joye study born - oppenheimer hamiltonians .",
    "periodic schrdinger operators are considered in @xcite , who employ a related multi - scale analysis .",
    "whereas in the other approaches the adiabatic and the semiclassical limit are taken simultaneously , both limits are clearly separated in our results .",
    "we consider this an important conceptual advantage .    to give a brief outline of our paper .",
    "in section  2 we explain the precise assumptions on the hamiltonian @xmath24 and construct the almost invariant subspace @xmath25 .",
    "the reference space @xmath37 and the unitary intertwining it with @xmath25 are explained section  3 .",
    "the central part of our paper is the expansion of the effective hamiltonian in section  4 . in particular , we work out the expansion for born - oppenheimer hamiltonians including order @xmath51 . we also show that by the howland trick the standard time - adiabatic theory can be subsumed under ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the semiclassical analysis for the effective hamiltonian is summarized in section  5 .",
    "last but not least , in section  6 we discuss the dirac equation with slowly varying external vector potentials , since it is the simplest hamiltonian for which the full generality of our approach is needed and yields interesting physical results . in this case @xmath52 and the classical symbol has two two - fold degenerate energy bands , one for the electron and one for the positron .",
    "thus the reference hilbert space e.g.  for the electron band is @xmath53 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is determined including order @xmath3 .",
    "the principal part @xmath46 describes the translational motion through the peierls substitution and the subprincipal part @xmath47 yields the spin precession as governed by the bmt equation .",
    "since the external vector potential appears through minimal coupling , the projection @xmath54 on the electron subspace depends nontrivially on both coordinates , in contrast to born - oppenheimer and time - adiabatic theory , where the relevant projection @xmath54 depends only on one of the canonical coordinates .",
    "we end the paper with some concluding remarks in section  7 and with an appendix reviewing some results on pseudodifferential calculus with operator - valued symbols .",
    "* acknowledgments : * we are grateful to andr martinez and gheorghe nenciu for helpful discussions , which in part initiated our work .",
    "we thank berndt thaller for his remarks on the problem of observables for the dirac equation and patrick grard for pointing out to us reference @xcite . s.t .",
    "also thanks raymond brummelhuis , george hagedorn , and alain joye for valuable comments and their interest in this work .",
    "is grateful to fabio pioli for a useful remark about fiber bundles .",
    "space - adiabatic perturbation theory deals with quantum systems in which it is possible to distinguish between fast and slow degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular we assume that the hilbert space @xmath26 admits a natural decomposition as @xmath55 @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the state space for the slow degrees of freedom and @xmath56 is the state space for the fast degrees of freedom .    as the second structural ingredient",
    "we require that the hamiltonian is given as the quantization of a @xmath58-valued function on the classical phase space @xmath59 of the slow degrees of freedom .",
    "hence we need to consider the generalization of the usual quantization rules to the case of @xmath58-valued functions on @xmath59 .",
    "this theory is well covered in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "still , for the convenience of the reader , we provide a self - contained review of the basic results in the appendix , where we also introduce the relevant notation .",
    "we now state the general assumptions on which the adiabatic perturbation theory will be based in the following .",
    "let @xmath2 be a separable hilbert space , the state space for the fast degrees of freedom , and @xmath60 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath29 of the full system is given as the weyl quantization of a semiclassical symbol @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that  @xmath29 is essentially self - adjoint on @xmath62 . a point in the classical phase space @xmath59",
    "is denoted by @xmath63 .",

    "note that for the case @xmath90 one can show that @xmath91  the weyl quantization of @xmath24  is essentially self - adjoint on the domain @xmath92 .",
    "the proof is postponed to an appendix to the space - adiabatic theorem .    in analogy with the usual time - adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics ,",
    "see section  [ sta ] , we baptize the following result as _ space - adiabatic theorem_. it establishes that there are almost invariant subspaces associated with isolated energy bands . in spirit",
    "the result is not new .",
    "however , to our knowledge it appears in this explicit form only recently in the literature .",
