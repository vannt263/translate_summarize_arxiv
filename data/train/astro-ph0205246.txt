    "since the discovery of the first planet of a distant sun - like star @xcite , radial velocity measurements have succeeded in locating about 80 such planets ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "although radial velocity ( rv ) techniques are well suited to finding such planets , they convey little information about the planets physical nature ; the inferences from such data are limited to the period and eccentricity of the planetary orbit and a lower limit on the planet s mass . to date , the only effective probes of the structure or composition of an extrasolar planet involve observations taken during transits , when the planet passes across the face of its parent star . and to date , only the planet circling hd 209458 is known to show such transits @xcite .",
    "accurate photometry of transits yields estimates of the planetary radius ; together with a mass estimate from rv data , these give a density estimate , and hence some information about the planet s composition and history @xcite . to learn about the composition in other than a global sense , however , one must turn to spectroscopy . during a transit , light that passes from the star through the outer parts of the planet s atmosphere",
    "has impressed on it a spectrographic signature of the atmospheric constituents @xcite and @xcite , henceforth referred to as br01 .",
    "giant planets in small orbits should have extended atmospheres , because of their high temperature , predominantly light - gas composition , and relatively low surface gravity .",
    "thus , the cross - section for these atmospheres to alter the passing starlight is comparatively large .",
    "early attempts to detect the planetary signature in 51 peg @xcite and in hd 209458 @xcite have been unsuccessful .",
    "at least one visible effect , absorption by atomic sodium in the atmosphere of hd 209458b , has however been measured using the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the total absorption from sodium corresponds to a relative intensity diminution of about 2.4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 averaged over a bandpass of about 1 nm .",
    "sodium , though spectroscopically very active , is a trace constituent of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "some molecules , notably h@xmath3o , co , and ch@xmath4 , are expected to be much more abundant species , with greater diagnostic potential . among these molecules ,",
    "co is of particular interest .",
    "simple considerations of radiative equilibrium suggest that the observable part of the atmosphere of hd 209458b should have a temperature between 1000 k and 1400 k ; rayleigh scattering from h@xmath3 sets a limit of about 1 bar to the deepest level that can be reached by a tangential light ray . at such high temperatures and low pressures ,",
    "co is expected to be the dominant carbon - bearing compound , abundant enough that even its relatively weak transitions ( in particular the first overtone rotation - vibration band redward of 2.3 @xmath0 m wavelength ) will generate absorption with significant equivalent width .",
    "indeed , models ( e.g. br01 ) show maximum depths for the lines in this band of up to 10@xmath5 relative to the stellar continuum , with variations in the total strength of the band and of the relative strengths of its component lines providing diagnostics for cloud height , heavy element abundance , and temperature . moreover , co is not present with high abundance in the terrestrial atmosphere , minimizing the difficulty of separating the planet s signal from terrestrial contamination . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2.3 @xmath0 m co band does lie in a region of significant ch@xmath4 absorption .",
    "because of methane s high opacity , even the small amount of ch@xmath4 in the earth s atmosphere is enough to cause problems with the analysis .",
    "the orbital period of hd 209458b is about 3.52 days . at",
    "a given longitude , observable transits occur once per week for intervals of about two months , while the time of transit occurs about 70 minutes later in the night for each passing week . since the duration of a transit is 3 hours , there are only a few optimally timed transits in each observing season .",
    "we describe here an exploratory observation of one transit of this planet using the nirspec echelle spectrograph .",
    "we observed hd 209458 with the keck ii telescope and the nirspec echelle spectrograph , the latter operating in high - resolution ( echelle ) mode @xcite .",
    "the transit we observed occurred on ut 2000 aug .",
    "23 ; on this night the nirspec was connected through the keck ii adaptive optics ( ao ) system .",
    "the spectrograph setup placed 7 orders ( echelle orders 31 ( redmost ) to 37 ( bluemost ) ) on the aladdin 1k x 1k detector , covering about half of the wavelength range from 2.04 @xmath0 m to 2.47 @xmath0 m at a spectral resolution @xmath6 . at this resolution",
    ", 1 pixel on the detector corresponds to a doppler shift of about 4.3 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we considered alternating observations of hd 209458 with ones of a reference star of similar spectral type .",
    "doing so would have provided a control against which to judge the reality of a detection , as well as a measurement of atmospheric extinction that was , in some sense , independent of that from the target star . on the other hand ,",
    "the anticipated noise level was already large enough to threaten detectability even with the full observing time devoted to hd 209548 , a few degrees of separation in the sky would be enough to make an important difference in the extinction , and slewing overhead and repeatability of positioning on the slit would become issues .",
    "based on these considerations , we judged that it was better not to observe a comparison star .",
    "we began taking spectra of hd 209458 at 05:41 ut , 35 minutes after the beginning of the transit , which occurred at 05:06 ut . at the time of the first observation ,",
    "the star was at an elevation of only 25 degrees .",
    "observations ended at 12:00 ut , when the telescope closed because of fog .",
    "cirrus reduced transmission during the first two hours of observation , and observations were interrupted for a short time after the transit s end because of high humidity . in all",
    ", we obtained 83 spectra of hd 209458 , of which 65 were of usable quality .",
    "of the good spectra , 22 were taken during the transit , and 43 afterwards .",
    "for all of the spectra , we used an integration time of 200 s. the in - transit spectra were taken with airmass values between 2.33 and 1.17 , and all of the out - of - transit spectra had airmasses below 1.16 . as we shall elaborate below , this distribution of atmospheric absorption between the in- and out - of - transit observations causes significant difficulties in the data analysis .",
    "the ultimate objective of the data analysis procedures is to produce the ratio of averaged spectra taken in and out of transit ( see br01 for details ) . in the averaging process",
    ", one must take account of the time - varying doppler shift of the planet , which changes by @xmath814 km s@xmath7 during the 3-hour duration of the transit .",
    "the analysis therefore proceeded in 4 major steps , as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we corrected the images for known instrumental influences ( notably gain and dark current ) , and extracted 1-dimensional spectra from the corrected images . in the process , we obtained estimates of noise , as well as of spectrum shift and cross - dispersion profile parameters for use in later fits .",
    "( 2 ) by means of regression against the various globally - determined spectrum parameters , and by a filtering process based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) of time series of spectra , we removed ( as best we could ) time - dependent variations caused by the spectrograph and by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "( 3 ) we formed an average out - of - transit spectrum , and took the ratio of each in - transit spectrum to this average .",
    "we cross - correlated these ratio spectra against appropriately doppler - shifted model transmission spectra ( which in this wavelength region are dominated by co absorption ) , and averaged together the resulting correlation functions .",
    "a peak in this average correlation would indicate a possible detection of co absorption .",
    "( 4 ) to calibrate the analysis process , we injected artificial signals of known magnitude into the data stream after step ( 1 ) , and measured the size of the resulting correlation peak .",
    "this allowed us to estimate the degree to which the complicated fitting procedures in step ( 2 ) attenuate real signals and decrease the sensitivity of the observations .",
    "low - level reduction of the nirspec images started with calibration .",
    "first we corrected each 2-dimensional image for position - dependent bias and for dark current .",
    "the nirspec detector has very substantial spatial variations in both its exposure - independent ( bias ) and its exposure - dependent ( dark ) contributions .",
    "we estimated these from suitable median - averages of a dozen or so dark images taken with long and short integration times .",
    "in addition , many pixels show excess noise , which may be thought of as time - varying dark current .",
    "we searched for these noisy pixels at two different points in the analysis , and flagged them so that intensity estimates involving them could be given low weight when computing the average spectra .",
    "next we corrected for gain variations by dividing the 2-dimensional images by flat field images .",
    "these flats were also derived by median - averaging a group of 12 bias- and dark - corrected wide - slit spectra of the incandescent calibration lamp .",
    "in addition to explicitly flagging noisy pixels , we computed noise estimates for all pixels , for use in subsequent averaging and fitting operations .",
    "extraction of 1-dimensional spectra from the 2-dimensional images proceeded by first estimating the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial describing the cross - dispersion order position as a function of the along - dispersion coordinate .",
    "this was done separately for each of the 7 echelle orders , and for each image .",
    "motion in the cross - dispersion direction from beginning to end of the night was about 6 pixels , and sample - to - sample variations in this position were typically a few tenths of a pixel . with the order positions known , we estimated the intensity at each wavelength via an optimally - weighted fit to a cross - dispersion point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we estimated the psf by averaging the intensity parallel to the estimated order positions for orders 2 through 6 ( orders 1 and 7 lying either very close to or partially outside the detector boundaries ) .",
    "we assigned weights to each pixel in the psf fit that were inversely proportional to the square of their estimated errors , including photon noise from the spectrum itself and bias- and dark",
    "- related noise values derived from the calibration process .",
    "the band of pixels included in psf fitting was 20 pixels wide , and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the orders was typically 4 pixels .",
    "we made no allowance for sky background . because of our relatively short exposures combined with the very small projected slit width produced by the ao system , no sky emission was visible at any wavelength in our spectra .",
    "after extracting the 1-dimensional spectra , we cleaned each spectrum by first correcting the values of obviously corrupted pixels , and then by spatial filtering . to locate corrupted pixels , we searched for isolated pixels that differed from the median of their immediate neighbors by more than 5 times their estimated error .",
    "we replaced such points with the local median values .",
    "typically , only a few points per time sample were corrected in this fashion  -  few enough that simple replacement by the local median gave an adequate correction .",
    "removing them was important , however , in order that the subsequent fourier filtering should not introduce large artifacts .",
    "we then spatial - filtered each order individually in the frequency domain , using a boxcar filter in wavenumber , but modified so that the transition to zero was through a cosine taper with width equal to 10% of the total width of the filter bandpass .",
    "the cutoff frequency was 1 cycle per 3.8 pixels ; this frequency was established by examination of the power spectra of several low - noise echelle spectra , and corresponds to the point at which the signal spectrum falls below the white - noise background in good spectra .",
    "an incidental benefit of filtering the spectra in this manner is to assure that they are band - limited , and hence that they may be shifted by fourier interpolation .",
    "the top trace in figure 1 shows order 5 ( echelle order 33 ) of a well - exposed spectrum that has been calibrated , extracted , and cleaned in the fashion just described .",
    "the signal level is about 2@xmath110@xmath9 photoelectrons per pixel along the dispersion , implying a poisson - statistics - limited signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of about 450 .",
    "this was near the best signal obtained , but the variability was large ; average spectra had about half this signal level , and some ( affected by clouds ) had much less .",
    "after scaling and shifting along the dispersion ( usually by a fraction of a pixel ) , successive spectra usually agree within errors that are roughly consistent with the poisson - statistics snr .",
    "over longer time intervals the differences are larger .",
    "comparison with a model of transmission through the earth s atmosphere , shown in the bottom trace in figure 1 , shows that almost all of the absorption features in the spectrum are telluric , caused mostly by ch@xmath4 . at wavelengths below 2.07 @xmath0 m",
    "one can see absorption from telluric h@xmath3o ; the only strong stellar spectrum feature seen is the hydrogen br @xmath10 line at 2.166 @xmath0 m . for use in later regression operations , we estimated the relative depth of the ch@xmath4 features in each time sample from the spectrum in order 5 ( echelle order 33 ) .    aside from telluric absorption ,",
    "the most prominent features of the spectrum are two sets of interference fringes , apparently arising from plane - parallel elements ( most likely windows or filters ) in the spectrograph s optics .",
    "these fringes can be seen most clearly in the top trace in fig . 1 , between wavelengths of 2.310 and 2.315 @xmath0 m .",
    "the two fringe systems have similar amplitudes , each modulating the transmission by a few percent .",
    "their wavelength dependences corresponds to optical thicknesses ( thickness times refractive index ) of about 1.8 cm and 2.2 cm ; the beating between the two fringe systems ( as well as internal structure within the lineshape of each fringe individually ) leads to a rather complicated pattern of transmission .",
    "moreover , the fringe patterns vary in both phase and amplitude on all time scales .",
    "these temporal variations are fairly large , and provide clear evidence that the fringes arise in the instrument and not , for instance , from molecular absorption in the stellar spectrum .",
    "we speculate that these variations arise from changes in the effective incidence angle and f/ number of the light beam striking the fringing elements , with these changes caused in turn by varying effectiveness of the adaptive optics correction .",
    "we lack information to verify this hypothesis , however . as part of the calibration process",
    ", we estimated the phases and amplitudes of each fringe system in order 4 ( echelle order 34 ) , which contains few telluric features .",
    "this 2-sinusoid parameterization gave a poor fit to the actual fringe pattern , but the phases and amplitudes proved to be useful external variables in the regression operation that follows .      to remove the remaining variations in atmospheric absorption and in the fringe pattern",
    ", we resorted to a linear regression against known external variables , followed by a filtering process based on singular value decomposition of time series of corrected spectra .    in the regression process",
    ", we worked not with the observed intensities @xmath11 as a function of pixel position and time , but rather with the logarithms of these quantities , denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "this transformation allowed us to express the large multiplicative changes in intensity ( due to clouds , for instance ) as additive functions , while preserving the form of the much smaller changes due to other causes .",
    "thus , we represented the observed spectra as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes a time average , the @xmath15 are the estimated time variation of various external variables , the @xmath16 are the regression coefficients , determined by minimum-@xmath17 fitting independently at each pixel , and the @xmath18 are the residuals around the fitted function .    the external variables @xmath15 used in the regression were parameters that related to the spectrum as a whole , or sometimes to individual spectrum orders , and that we took to be symptomatic of various perturbations to the spectrum detection process .",
    "these included the total intensity averaged over each spectrum order , the relative depth of the telluric ch@xmath4 features , the shift of these features ( in pixels ) along the dispersion direction , and the amplitude and phase of the larger - amplitude fringe system , as measured in order 4 .",
    "the depth of telluric features was , more or less , a proxy for airmass .",
    "better results were obtained using the measured feature depths , however , so the computed airmass was not included as a parameter in the regression . as described above",
    ", we estimated amplitudes and phases for each of the 2 fringe systems ; we found the corresponding parameters for the 2 systems to be well correlated , however , so we used only one set of amplitudes and phases in the regression .",
    "finally , the fringe shifts were large enough ( @xmath8 1 pixel ) compared to the fringe wavelength ( about 8 pixels ) that it proved necessary to include as parameters both linear and quadratic functions of the fringe shift .",
    "after fitting the regression coefficients , we produced corrected spectra @xmath19 given simply by @xmath20 note that these corrected spectra did not have the effects of fringes and telluric absorption removed .",
    "rather , these features were merely adjusted to have their average values , to the extent that these were consistent with the data and with our understanding of the observations systematic errors .",
    "after the regression process , we found that certain systematic time variations remained in the spectra .",
    "that is , we found that significant correlations existed between the time series at different pixels , and that the responsible time variations did not have the form of any of the identified external parameters . to remove these , we started with the matrix of residuals @xmath18 for each echelle order",
    "we then computed the singular value decomposition of this matrix @xcite , which may be written @xmath21 here the @xmath22 vectors @xmath23 are orthonormal and span the space of all possible time series of length @xmath22 .",
    "the orthonormal vectors @xmath24 each correspond to one of the @xmath23 , and give the relative amplitude of that time series component at each pixel . finally , the scalars @xmath25 ( which are ordered from largest to smallest ) give the amplitude of @xmath26 in the actual time series .",
    "since the @xmath27 and @xmath28 are both orthonormal , @xmath29 describes the total variance in the time series attributable to @xmath26 .",
    "if the @xmath24 corresponding to ( say ) the largest @xmath25 displays components of similar magnitude for many values of @xmath30 , then that mode of variation accounts for an unusually large part of the total variance , and involves strong correlations among pixels .",
    "such behavior is characteristic of many kinds of instrumental error ( also , alas , of many kinds of signal ) .",
    "after some experimentation , we concluded that , for these data , the best compromise between suppressing noise and attenuating possible real signals was to truncate the variations corresponding to the 5 largest singular values .",
    "we thus set @xmath31 to @xmath32 in eq ( 3 ) to zero , and created the filtered form of @xmath18 by carrying out the indicated matrix multiplications .",
    "the corrected spectra were then formed as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .      to obtain an estimate of the out - of - transit spectrum , we simply averaged the corrected spectra that we obtained after the end of the planetary transit , weighting each pixel according to the estimated error for that wavelength and time sample .",
    "we then formed the ratio of each in - transit spectrum with the averaged out - of - transit spectrum .",
    "we searched for evidence of co absorption in the spectrum ratios by cross - correlating these ratios against a model spectrum that was sampled on the nirspec wavelength grid .",
    "this approach is similar to that used by @xcite in their search for evidence for ch@xmath4 in the infrared spectrum of @xmath33 boo .",
    "we obtained a suitable template spectrum from the fiducial model of hd 209458b described by br01 .",
    "the model spectrum could not be used directly ; first it was necessary to separate the spectrum of co from that of other molecules ( notably h@xmath3o and ch@xmath4 ) .",
    "as explained in br01 , for species such as co , which are expected to be present with a nearly constant mixing ratio throughout the planetary atmosphere , there is a simple and accurate approximation to the emerging transmission spectrum .",
    "for such opacity sources , one may write @xmath34   \\ \\ , \\eqno ( 4)\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the wavelength - dependent ratio of in- to out - of - transit intensity , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the radii of the star and the planet , @xmath38 is the density scale height in the planetary atmosphere , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the line opacity from the species under consideration and from the underlying continuum , respectively . for this purpose we used estimates of @xmath36 and @xmath37 from @xcite .",
    "we took estimates of @xmath38 and the opacities from the 0.01-bar level of the model , and checked the approximation to @xmath41 against output from the full model to verify that the line depths were ( very nearly ) correct .    for each of the spectrum ratio samples calculated above , we formed the cross - correlation against the model co spectrum , shifted in wavelength according to the planet s computed doppler shift at the time of the measurement .",
    "we corrected the standard spectrum wavelengths for the orbital motion of the planet , but not for the earth s orbital motion and rotation ( which cause changes of less than 0.1 pixel during the transit ) , nor for the mean radial velocity of the parent star .",
    "a true signal , if present , should therefore have appeared as a correlation peak at the mean system radial velocity of -14.8 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the solid line in the top panel of figure 2 shows the result of averaging together the cross - correlations for all of the time samples of order 5 , weighted to account for their calculated errors .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same averaged cross - correlation for order 6 .",
    "no significant peak is seen in either correlation function ; clearly the co transmission spectrum of hd 209458b , if present , is too weak to be detected in these observations .",
    "the procedure used to calculate the ratio spectra was complicated , with evident opportunities for attenuating the desired signal in the process of removing unwanted noise .",
    "we therefore calibrated the detection scheme by injecting simulated planetary transmission spectra into the calibrated and extracted in - transit spectra , and reducing these adulterated spectra as we did the original data .",
    "for this purpose we used the spectrum ratio @xmath42 computed for the fiducial model described by br01 , including all opacity sources , not just co. we calculated @xmath41 on a wavelength grid with 2 km s@xmath7 resolution , and integrated over nirspec pixels to give the desired wavelength sampling . for each observed spectrum sample",
    ", we scaled the model spectrum ratio according to the calculated transit light - curve for that time , and shifted it in wavelength with the appropriate doppler shift .",
    "we then simply multiplied the observed spectrum by @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 was an arbitrary scale factor that allowed relatively large signals to be injected , for easy detection .",
    "we processed the adulterated data just as we did the original spectra .",
    "results are shown in figure 2 for @xmath45 and for @xmath46 .",
    "the size of these correlation peaks , relative to the noise background , suggests that the current data set is inadequate to reveal the co spectrum if it has the same strength as in the model ; for a reliable detection at the nominal band strength , one would need to improve sensitivity by a factor of about 3 .",
    "we performed a similar test in which we injected the artificial signal after the svd filtering step , i.e. , immediately before computing the cross - correlations . in this case",
    ", we detected the signal expected from the model ( @xmath47 ) with snr = 3 , i.e. , with a confidence similar to that attained in the original test with @xmath48 .",
    "this confirmed our suspicion that the data - cleaning process attenuates real transit signals .",
    "we subsequently tested several variants of the data cleaning procedure , but were unable to improve the situation : techniques that retained more signal amplitude also admitted more noise , with no gain in the ultimate snr .",
    "this testing also showed that the loss of signal occurred in the regression step , i.e. , in the process of fitting out the airmass - dependent variation of atmospheric absorption , and not in the svd filtering .",
    "based on the cross - correlation analysis , we can set a limit to the co band strength in hd 209458 s in - transit transmission spectrum : it is no more than about 3 times its strength in br01 s fiducial model . from an astrophysical point of view , this limit is not informative . as indicated in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the strength of the co absorption feature is proportional to the logarithm of the line - to - continuum opacity ratio . for lines near the co bandhead , this ratio in the fiducial model is already about 10@xmath49 .",
    "tripling the line strength would require another factor of 10@xmath50 , which is not possible .    in view of this noise - limited non - detection , one must ask whether further observations of this sort are worthwhile .",
    "we believe the answer to this question is yes ; it seems likely that significant improvements in detection sensitivity can be achieved , even with the same facilities as used in the current study .",
    "first , it should be possible to reduce the poisson noise in the observations by a significant factor .",
    "as described above , these observations were heavily compromised by clouds during the first half of the transit .",
    "good weather would increase the number of detected in - transit photons by about a factor of 2 . with good weather throughout , one would also see about twice as large a range of planetary doppler shift , which would help to separate planetary spectrum features from the telluric ch@xmath4 lines . a further gain in light flux",
    "could probably be obtained by using the system without ao . with many fewer optical surfaces and a seeing - limited point spread function ( rather than one with a sharp central peak but much light lost in the far wings , as the ao system produces )",
    ", it should be possible to increase system transmission by another significant factor , perhaps as large as 5 . for observations of such a bright star as hd 209458 ,",
    "the additional sky background associated with non - ao operation would not cause difficulties .",
    "even more important than increasing the photon flux , it is possible to improve the sensitivity by observing a transit that is centered near the star s meridian crossing . in the current data set , all of the transit observations occurred at relatively high",
    "airmass , when the terrestrial ch@xmath4 features were stronger by as much as a factor of 2 than during the out - of - transit observations .",
    "thus , the time dependence of the terrestrial absorption was qualitatively the same as that of the sought - after planetary absorption : large during the transit and small thereafter .",
    "this similarity of functional form caused the data cleaning procedures to attenuate the transit signal strongly . by choosing a transit that is more favorably positioned during the night",
    ", this problem can be largely alleviated .",
    "finally , one can hope for improvements in the nirspec optics that would remove the fringes that complicate the data analysis .",
    "even lacking such instrumental improvements , we speculate that operating without adaptive optics would yield more stable fringes , since variations in the effective f/ number and incidence angle of the beam entering the spectrograph would likely be smaller .",
    "the mere presence of fringes is much less damaging than their temporal variation ; making them more repeatable would greatly improve the prospects for detecting small time - dependent signals .",
    "data presented herein were obtained at the w.m .",

    "the observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.m .",
