    "more than twenty years ago edwards and oakeshott proposed a statistical mechanics framework for granular materials in mechanical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the idea was to replace the energy by the total volume of the sample @xmath2 .",
    "thus the entropy of the system is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of stable states for a given volume @xmath2 ( and given number of grains @xmath5 ) .",
    "the quantity equivalent to temperature within this description is the compactivity @xmath6 . in connection with edwards proposal ,",
    "aste _ et al _ has found for static packings of spheres an invariant distribution of voronoi volumes at the grain level @xcite .",
    "also , the random close packing fraction @xmath7 and the random loose packing fraction @xmath8 have been associated with configurations with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently that two granular samples with the same packing fraction may not have the same properties , and an aditional macroscopic variable must be introduced in the statistical description . in reference",
    "@xcite was found that we can produce two samples with the same @xmath11 but different stresses .",
    "indeed , the stress tensor @xmath12 has been included in a more general statistical description @xcite ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we deal in this article with the so called _ parking lot model _ ( plm ) introduced by nowak _",
    "et al _ in the context of experiments of compaction of grains @xcite .",
    "starting with the statistical mechanics for the plm proposed by tarjus and viot @xcite , we obtain the random loose packing fraction for this model and introduce an order parameter @xmath0 that characterizes how far from a steady state situation the model is .",
    "we propose that a quantity analog to @xmath0 can be used as the order parameter in the continuum description of slow and dense granular flows by aranson and tsimring , mediating how solid and fluid is the form of the stress tensor @xcite .",
    "the plm is a model of random adsorption and desorption of particles on a substrate .",
    "particles are disorbed with rate @xmath13 and adsorbed with rate @xmath14 , with a no overlapping condition . for a given initial condition of the substrate",
    ", the model converges to a stationary state packing fraction @xmath15 around which it fluctuates .",
    "@xmath15 depends only on the ratio @xmath16 , which allow us to map the parameter @xmath17 to @xmath18 or @xmath19 of references @xcite . for large @xmath17",
    "we have @xmath20 @xcite and the convergence to a stationary state is very slow , reminiscent of glassy behavior @xcite .",
    "the plm is though to represent an average column of grains .",
    "tarjus and viot characterized the configurations produced by the plm with two variables @xcite .",
    "one of them is the packing fraction @xmath11 and the other is the insertion probability @xmath21 , which is the available line fraction for a new insertion .",
    "tarjus and viot recognized the need for an additional variable because of some memory effects observed in experiments that can be reproduced within the plm if we change @xmath17 in the course of a monte carlo simulation : we can generate two configurations with the same @xmath11 but with different subsequent evolution and by allowing a variation in @xmath17 , for a given finite time , we can obtain more dense substrates @xcite .",
    "thus , the history of the configuration is encoded in @xmath21 , which is a structure variable @xcite .",
    "the aditional variable @xmath21 is only needed to characterize configurations which are not produced in steady state , since in steady state the insertion probability @xmath22 is given by ( eq . 2 in @xcite ) : @xmath23.\\ ] ]     obtained with monte carlo simulations ( circles ) .",
    "the continuum line is a gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath24 @xcite . in the inset",
    "we show @xmath25 vs. the insertion probability @xmath21 for the plm as given by eqs .",
    "[ rlp1 ] and [ rlp2 ] .",
    "the dotted line is equation [ rlpphi ] . at @xmath26",
    "the difference in @xmath8 is less than @xmath27% .[phirlp ] ]",
    "if @xmath28 is the total lenght available for a new insertion ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the size of the system ) , for given @xmath5 , @xmath30 and @xmath28 we have a configurational integral in terms of the gaps @xmath31 ( eq . 25 in @xcite ) :",
    "@xmath32    with @xmath33 being the step function .",
    "equation [ zgrande ] can be solved with a saddle point method in the limit of large @xmath5 , @xmath30 and @xmath28 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 fixed .    in steady state , for @xmath36 we have @xmath26 @xcite . in the limit of small @xmath21",
    "we obtain a random loose packing fraction by taking the limit @xmath10 in the above description ( see appendix ) : @xmath37    since the random loose packing of granular media depends on friction @xcite , from equation [ rlpphi ] we see that greater @xmath21 suggest grains with larger friction coefficient . for a given @xmath11 , a greater @xmath21 can also be associated to greater heterogeneity of voids at the grain level . in the limit @xmath38 , from equation [ rlpphi ]",
    "we get @xmath39 .",
    "this value for @xmath8 correspond to smooth grains .",
    "a gamma distribution of voronoi lenghts @xcite is obtained for @xmath40 ( see figure [ phirlp ] ) .",
    "the invariant distribution found in experiments by aste _",
    "et al _ for spheres packings in mechanical equilibrium is also a gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "it have been reported that at a packing fraction near the @xmath8 found by us the process of compaction is slowered . before reaching @xmath15 ,",
    "typically we have four differents regimes as we record the evolution of the packing fraction in a monte carlo simulation of the plm @xcite . during a first stage ,",
    "@xmath11 `` ... increases rapidly until a value of around @xmath41 '' @xcite , and from this point afterwards the increase in @xmath11 is considerably slower .",

    "the solid line is equation [ phie ] , the steady state relation between @xmath11 and @xmath21 .",
    "[ parorden ] ]    we introduce now a parameter @xmath0 which is , basically , the quotient between @xmath46 given by equation [ zgrande ] and @xmath47 which is the configurational integral without the restriction of having a definite value of @xmath28 , _ i.e. _ when only the first @xmath48 in equation [ zgrande ] is considered .",
    "this leads to : @xmath49 with @xmath50 @xcite and the entropy density @xmath51 is given by equation [ entropy ] in the appendix . in figure",
    "[ parorden]a we can see @xmath52 . for a given value of @xmath21 , @xmath53 as @xmath11 is increased up to a maximum value @xmath43 .",
    "this maximum value of @xmath11 can be estimated from a graph like the one shown in figure [ parorden]b .    in figure",
    "[ parorden]c it can be seen that @xmath45 is equivalent to say that we are approaching a steady state situation . with this in mind , in figure [ orden ] we plot the insertion probability @xmath21 vs. the packing fraction @xmath11 for a given value of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we did this by solving numerically the relevant equations needed for to evaluate equation [ rho ] .",
    "it is worth to remember that a @xmath54 statistical description for the plm makes sense only if we need to consider configurations out of steady state , since in steady state these two variables are related by equation [ phie ] .",
    "thus , configurations with @xmath1 age .",
    "vs packing fraction @xmath11 for different values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the particular case @xmath55 is given by equation [ phie ] , the steady state relation between @xmath11 and @xmath21 .",
    "the dark region are not available ( @xmath56 ) configurations and its frontier is defined by the @xmath55 curve . configurations with @xmath1 age .",
    "the dotted line is a schematic representation of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "[ orden ] ]    in the last stages of a monte carlo simulation of the plm @xmath11 is increasing into @xmath15 with a small variation in the insertion probability @xmath21 .",
    "talbot , tarjus and viot found in reference @xcite that for @xmath58 , there is a minimum in @xmath21 as a function of time that occurs at a packing fraction @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that for slow compaction if @xmath59 the system can increase its packing fraction while increasing or decreasing @xmath21 , depending if @xmath11 is greater or smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "this should have consequences for _ processes _ ( curves ) in a @xmath54 plane like the one shown in figure [ orden ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath61 in the plm we have two zones in which we expect different behaviour . in terms of @xmath17",
    "these zones are : @xmath62 and @xmath59 , with @xmath40 and @xmath63 .    in reference",
    "@xcite the authors reported a phase transition when inserting slowly a rod into a column of grains : the system s response to shear changes at a certain packing fraction @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath64 can be localized by monitoring the change in height @xmath65 of the column , after removing the rod , as a function of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to put the results of reference @xcite in terms of a process that starts from a packing fraction @xmath66 on the @xmath55 curve of figure [ orden ] and ends on a packing fraction @xmath67 , with @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "can this two - variable description of the plm be related to the volume - stress proposal of edwards and others ?",
    "we believe that a connection can be made by using a quantity analog to @xmath52 given by equation [ rho ] as the order parameter in the stress tensor @xmath69 proposed by aranson and tsimring in their continuum description of slow and dense granular flows @xcite : @xmath70,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the stress under static conditions with the same geometry .",
    "thus , @xmath0 in eq .",
    "[ rho ] can control how fluid and solid is the form for the stress tensor .",
    "for @xmath1 we have a partially fluidized granular medium . at best ,",
    "this is a first step , a suggestion , towards a real connection between edwards statistical mechanics and granular hydrodynamics @xcite .    finally , since configurations with @xmath1 in the plm age we must say something about the relevant time scales for this model .",
    "kolan , nowak and tkachenko have found that the low relaxation frequency @xmath72 and the high relaxation frequency @xmath73 for this model are given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to speak of thermodynamic processes in figure [ orden ] , the observation time @xmath77 @xcite must satisfy @xmath78 . from figure 5 of reference @xcite",
    ", we can see that this condition on @xmath77 can be satisfied only for high packing fractions .",
    "only for @xmath59 we have at least two orders of magnitude of separation between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we have obtained in this article the random loose packing fraction @xmath8 for the parking lot model , where @xmath8 is the lower packing fraction in which we can find a sample in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "we have done this by taking the limit of infinite compactivity in the statistical description of tarjus and viot , in which a macro state is characterized by its packing fraction @xmath11 and its insertion probability @xmath21 .",
    "the compactivity @xmath79 is the analog of temperature in the statistical mechanics for granular materials proposed by edwards .",
    "we have proposed an order parameter @xmath52 that characterizes how far from a steady situation the model is .",
    "thus , configurations with @xmath1 age . with @xmath0 , we proposed a connection of statistical mechanics with the continuum description of slow and dense granular flows by aranson and tsimring . by considering the relevant time scales for this model obtained by kolan , nowak and tkachenko , we have argued that for blocked configurations ( @xmath61 ) , only for even higher packing fractions we expect to be able to speak of thermodynamic processes for this model .",
    "we thank gustavo gutirrez for useful suggestions .",
    "this work has been done under the pcp - fonacit franco - venezuelan program _ dynamics and statics of granular materials _ , and was supported in part by did of the universidad simn bolvar .    , we have a maximum @xmath80 , which implies a maximum packing fraction @xmath43 .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to @xmath81 , the maximum random loose packing fraction for the plm ( see eq .",
