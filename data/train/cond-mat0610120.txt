    "interest in transition metal oxides has never been restricted to the most spectacular phenomenon of the high-@xmath7 superconductivity , but also concerns , _ inter alia _ , metal - insulator transitions , colossal magnetoresistance , and magnetic and orbital ordering @xcite . among the numerous magnetic transitions that have been studied ,",
    "most of them are associated with structural transitions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , no anomalous temperature dependence of the structural parameters has been reported in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 members of the oxides family a@xmath10ab@xmath11o@xmath12 , which are currently attracting much attention @xcite .",
    "these a@xmath0abo@xmath1 compounds crystallize in the k@xmath13cdcl@xmath1 structure which consists of infinite chains along the c - axis made of a 1  :  1 alternation of face - shared trigonal prisms ( ao@xmath1)@xmath14 and octahedra ( bo@xmath1)@xmath15 . according to their rhombohedral symmetry , the a cations separate the chains , the latter forming a hexagonal array . for such compounds , when the a trigonal prism ( tp ) site is occupied by a magnetic cation , this provides interesting physical properties created by the coexistence of one - dimensionality character and geometrical frustration .",
    "this is illustrated by ca@xmath0co@xmath16o@xmath1 for which the ordered antiferromagnetic state below @xmath17k [ ] bears some similarity to the partially disordered antiferromagnetic ( pda ) state as originally proposed for abx@xmath0 geometrically frustrated 1d compounds @xcite . but in marked contrast with the abx@xmath0 members , the intrachain coupling in ca@xmath0co@xmath16o@xmath1 is ferromagnetic @xcite and the magnetic field induced magnetization is very spectacular @xcite .",
    "indeed , as a function of the applied magnetic field , several magnetization jumps with a constant field spacing are observed . besides , the saturation magnetization is larger than expected from the assumption of different spin states for co@xmath18 high spin ( hs ) and low spin ( ls ) in the tp and oct .",
    ", respectively .",
    "nonetheless , the ferromagnetic coupling along the chains is probably related to this `` spin state ordering '' , the latter resulting from the different crystalline electrical fields in each co@xmath18 polyhedron .",
    "such a coupling is likely to involve both ls co@xmath18 and o ions @xcite . in that respect ,",
    "the different magnetic behavior of the two isostructural compounds ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 and ca@xmath0corho@xmath1 is worth mentioning @xcite . in the latter",
    ", the ferromagnetic intrachain coupling is expected as rh@xmath18 is isoelectronic to co@xmath18 ( 3d6 ) , whereas the global magnetic behavior of ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 appears to be antiferromagnetic although fe@xmath18 ( d5 ) or fe@xmath19 ( d6 ) are both hs cations with large s values ( 5/2 or 2 ) .",
    "such different background states for the ca@xmath0mrho@xmath1 1d compounds ( with m  =  fe and m  =  co ) suggest subtle changes of the electronic structure .    in ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 , contradicting results",
    "have been reported for the oxidation states of iron and rhodium cations which add more complexity to the interpretation . in order to shed light on the magnetic and electronic behavior of ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1",
    ", we compare , in continuation of previous work @xcite , results of band structure calculations to the electrical and magnetic properties , together with mssbauer spectroscopy measurements .",
    "the polycrystalline sample of ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 was prepared by mixing the precursors cao , fe@xmath16o@xmath0 and rh@xmath16o@xmath0 in the molar ratios 3  :  0.5  :  0.5 .",
    "the thoroughly mixed powder , pressed in bars ( @xmath20 ) was first heated at @xmath21c for 24h and then at @xmath22c for a @xmath23h period with intermediate x - ray controls .",
    "the crystallinity and purity of the obtained black product were checked by x - ray powder diffraction .",
    "the diffraction peaks have been indexed in the space group r-3c with a and c values very close to those reported in refs .",
    "[ ] , allowing to refine the 3  :  1  :  1 ratio for the cation ca  :  fe  :  rh with an uncertainty of approximately 3  % which is acceptable in all respects .",
    "besides , small intensity peaks were also found , that could be attributed to ca@xmath16fe@xmath16o@xmath24 .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed with a squid magnetometer .",
    "electrical resistivity was measured by the four probe technique .",
    "the four electrical contacts were ultrasonically deposited on a bar .",
    "the measurements were made by using a physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the @xmath25fe powder mssbauer resonance spectrum at room temperature was performed with a transmission geometry by use of a constant acceleration spectrometer and a @xmath26-ray source from @xmath25co embedded in a rhodium matrix .",
    "the velocity scale was calibrated with an @xmath27-fe foil at room temperature .",
    "the spectra were fitted with lorentzian lines by the unpublished mosfit program .",
    "the isomer shift was referred to metallic @xmath27-fe at 293k .",
    "ferho@xmath1 . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    when compared to the @xmath28-dependent reciprocal magnetic susceptibility curve [ @xmath29 of ca@xmath0co@xmath16o@xmath1 as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath30 curve of ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_ferh ] ) exhibits a much more linear behavior extending over a larger @xmath28 range .",
    "this result reflects a lack of ferromagnetic interactions for the latter as also attested by the different extrapolated temperatures for @xmath31 , the curie - weiss temperature @xmath32 values being @xmath33k and @xmath34k for ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 and ca@xmath0co@xmath16o@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "furthermore in ca@xmath0co@xmath16o@xmath1 , a @xmath35 drop below @xmath17k is observed , which indicates that a net ferrimagnetic state is reached : on each triangle made by three neighboring coo@xmath1 chains , two chains are antiferromagnetically coupled ( zero net magnetic moment ) whereas the third one exhibits a net ferromagnetic magnetization along the direction of the external applied magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath30 curve of ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 exhibits a @xmath35 increase below @xmath36k indicative of a 3d antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "analysis of the slope along the linear region yields an effective paramagnetic moment @xmath37 .",
    "we will refer to this experimental value below in subsection  c.    the rt mssbauer spectrum of this compound consists of a paramagnetic doublet and is consistent with the measurements reported in ref .",
    "however , the best fit was obtained with two mssbauer components , the hyperfine parameters of which are given in table  [ table : moss ] .",
    "the observed isomer shift value ( @xmath38mm / s ) of the main component ( @xmath39 ) is typical of fe@xmath18 ions .",
    "its high absolute quadrupole splitting value ( @xmath40mm / s ) shows that this site is not in the octahedral symmetry , and therefore the fe ions are located in trigonal sites . for the minor mssbauer component ( @xmath41 ) , the is value of @xmath42mm / s is rather corresponding to fe@xmath19 ions .",
    "therefore the vast majority of iron ions in ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 are in the trivalent state .    .refined @xmath25fe mssbauer hyperfine parameters of ca@xmath0ferho@xmath1 at room temperature including the linewidth @xmath43 , and % : relative intensity of the mssbauer site . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for the lsda band structure calculations we used the augmented spherical wave ( asw ) method in its scalar - relativistic implementation @xcite . in the asw method ,",
    "the wave function is expanded in atom - centered augmented spherical waves , which are hankel functions and numerical solutions of schrdinger s equation , respectively , outside and inside the so - called augmentation spheres . in order to optimize the basis set ,",
    "additional augmented spherical waves were placed at carefully selected interstitial sites .",
    "the choice of these sites as well as the augmentation radii were automatically determined using the sphere - geometry optimization algorithm @xcite .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations were performed using the linear tetrahedron method with up to 85 * k*-points within the irreducible wedge .",
    "in contrast to our previous work @xcite we here use a new version of the asw code , which takes the non - spherical contributions to the charge density inside the atomic spheres into account .",
    "all calculations are based on the powder data of niitaka _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in a first step",
    ", we performed a set of calculations , where spin - degeneracy was enforced .",
    "the resulting partial densities of states ( dos ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    while o @xmath44 dominated bands are located in the interval from @xmath45 to @xmath46ev , three groups of bands of mainly metal @xmath47-character are found at higher energies . however , the strong @xmath47@xmath48 hybridization causes large @xmath48/@xmath47 contributions above / below @xmath49ev , reaching up to 50% especially for the rh @xmath50 states .    according to the partial fe @xmath51 densities of states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]     dos of spin degenerate @xmath52.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the trigonal crystal field at the iron sites results in a splitting into non - degenerate @xmath53 as well as doubly degenerate @xmath54 and @xmath55 states .",
    "the rh @xmath50 states as given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]     dos of spin degenerate @xmath52.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    experience a nearly perfect separation of the @xmath50 states into occupied @xmath56 and empty @xmath57 states due to the octahedral crystal field at these sites . whereas strong @xmath58-type @xmath47@xmath48 bonding places the rh @xmath50 @xmath57 states at @xmath59ev , the peak at about @xmath60ev traces back to fe @xmath55 states . for this reason ,",
    "spin - polarization of the latter bands is highly favourable , with the observed high - spin / low - spin scenario .    in a second step ,",
    "spin - polarized calculations were performed leading to the observed antiferromagnetic ordering , which is by 1mryd per fe atom more stable than the ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "well localized magnetic moments of @xmath61 ( rh ) , @xmath62 ( fe ) , @xmath63 ( o ) , and @xmath64 ( ca ) are obtained in close agreement with those of previous calculations @xcite .",
    "these values reflect the experimental result of low- and high - spin states at the octahedral and trigonal prismatic sites , respectively . the total moment per sublattice",
    "amounts to @xmath65 , which still might be slightly altered by the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling , which is beyond the present work . in particular , the obtained total magnetic moment per sublattice is smaller than the experimental value deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_ferh ] as was also observed for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "worth mentioning are the rather high magnetic moments at the oxygen sites arising from the strong @xmath47@xmath48 hybridization , which sum up to about @xmath67 per trigonal prism .",
    "adding to the @xmath51 moment they lead to the formation of extended localized moments already observed in @xmath66 @xcite and confirm the formal fe @xmath68 configuration , hence , the formal @xmath6 state .",
    "the high - spin behavior at the iron sites is clearly observed in the partial dos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ,    .,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    where the fe @xmath51 minority states display sharp peaks above @xmath69 and the spin majority states are spread over a large energy interval as a result of the strong @xmath48-@xmath47 hybridization .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order growing out of the spin - polarized calculations goes along with the opening of an insulating gap of about 0.4ev as revealed by fig .",
    "this value corresponds to an activation energy of 0.2ev , which is in remarkably good agreement with the experimental value deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_ferh ] .",
    "in summary , we have performed susceptibility , mssbauer spectroscopy , and transport measurements on the antiferromagnetic insulating compound @xmath52 .",
    "the experimental data have been compared with lsda band structure calculations , and the agreement is found to be very good . in particular , the calculations confirm several experimental key results as , e.g. , the charge and spin states at the fe and rh sites including the characteristic high - spin / low - spin scenario , the antiferromagnetic ordering , and the activation energy .",
