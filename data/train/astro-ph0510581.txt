    "the star @xmath0 carinae ( hd 93308 ) , a prominent member of the trumpler 16 ( tr16 ) association , is undoubtedly the most well - known and well - studied luminous blue variable ( lbv ) .",
    "it is possibly the most massive star in the galaxy and its unstable nature has attracted many investigators ( see davidson & humphreys 1997 for a review ) .",
    "there is now strong evidence that @xmath0 carinae is a binary .",
    "a period of @xmath32023 days is inferred from periodic spectral and light changes in the visual ( damineli 1996 , damineli et al .",
    "2000 ) and the near ir ( whitelock et al . 1994 , 2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray light curve varies strongly with a @xmath4 day period ( ishibashi et al . 1999 ; corcoran 2005 ) .",
    "two x - ray eclipses ( 1998.0 and 2003.5 ) have been observed in which the x - ray flux dropped to less than @xmath515% of its peak for @xmath33 months .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum suggests a colliding - wind binary ( ishibashi et al .",
    "1999 ; pittard & corcoran 2002 ; corcoran 2005 ) , with the dense stellar wind from the massive lbv primary ( @xmath0cara ) colliding with the higher velocity , lower density wind of a hot o - type secondary ( @xmath0carb ) in a highly eccentric 5.54 yr orbit .",
    "the presence of a hot secondary is also inferred from photoionization modeling of the variability of doubly - ionized lines from the weigelt blobs ( verner et al .",
    "2005 ) .    until now @xmath0carb",
    "has evaded direct detection because @xmath0cara  dominates the systemic light from the infrared through the uv longward of ly@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0cara s dense wind and dusty ejecta extinguish much of its own uv and visible luminosity , which drop dramatically below 1250   ( hillier et al . 2001 ; gull et al .",
    "2005a ) .    in this letter",
    "we report the first spectroscopic evidence and direct detection of @xmath0carb  using far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) spectra from two epochs .",
    "one is a series of large aperture ( lwrs ) far - uv ( fuv ) spectra obtained in 2003 june as @xmath0car  approached and entered the x - ray eclipse .",
    "the second is a set of lwrs and narrow slit ( hirs ) spectra obtained in 2004 , six months after the end of the x - ray eclipse .",
    "the lwrs observations of @xmath0car  also include two 11th magnitude b stars that lie close to @xmath0car , which , as we shall see , account for about half of the observed fuv flux in the lwrs observations .",
    "luckily , during some of the lif1 channel hirs observations of @xmath0car , we serendipitously obtained spectra of the b stars through the hirs slit of the sic1 channel .",
    "comparison of the sic1 hirs observation and the eclipse ingress observation enables us to disentangle the lwrs spectra and reveal the spectrum of @xmath0carb .",
    "however , because the lwrs spectra contain the b stars , it is necessary to employ a three - step process to establish that the lif1 hirs spectrum of @xmath0car  is dominated by the flux of @xmath0carb , and not @xmath0cara .",
    "first , we demonstrate that the lif1 hirs spectrum of @xmath0car  plus the sic1 hirs spectrum of the nearby b stars account for all fuv flux from the system obtained through the lwrs aperture at nearly the same epoch .",
    "this implies that the lwrs spectra are dominated by @xmath0car  and the nearby b stars and that there is very little contribution from other sources , such as the surrounding nebulosity .",
    "second , we show that the lwrs spectrum of @xmath0car  at the start of the x - ray minimum ( when the secondary is expected to be eclipsed ) is nearly all due to the b stars and that @xmath0cara  contributes very little to the fuv flux of the system .",
    "third , we show that the fuv spectrum outside of eclipse ( when @xmath0carbis expected to contribute to the flux ) is much stronger and consistent with a source of higher effective temperature than @xmath0cara .",
    "fuse observed @xmath0car  was observed by _ fuse _  multiple times between 2000 and 2004 , using the lwrs aperture ( 30@xmath630 ) .",
    "this letter utilizes a subset of these data ( see table [ etaobs ] ) .",
    "the observations were processed with the _ fuse _  data processing and calibration pipeline ( calfuse 3.0 ) .",
    "spectra from the individual exposures were coadded with the idl program fuse_register .",
    "the _ fuse _  instrument ( moos et al . 2000 ; sahnow et al . 2000 ) obtains spectra in four independent optical channels : lif1 and lif2 ( 995  1185  ) , and sic1 and sic2 ( 900  1100  ) .",
    "each channel has two segments ( e.g. lif1a , lif1b ) that each cover @xmath3100  .",
    "the relative alignment of the four channels is influenced by the thermal history of the satellite in the days preceding a given observation .",
    "thermal flexure in the instrument often results in alignment shifts of 10 - 20  in the other three channels relative to lif1 , which is held fixed by the offset guiding system . for hirs aperture ( 125@xmath620 ) observations ,",
    "this often means the target is only in lif1 .",
    "the sic2 ( 920 - 1100  ) hirs aperture was on @xmath0car  for 6.9 ks of the 17.1 ks april 11 observation .",
    "after scaling the flux by a factor of 5 , the sic2b hirs spectrum is essentially identical to that of lif1a hirs , indicating that the sic2 aperture was not perfectly centered on target .",
    "sic2 adds the 1082  1100   region , containing the important  @xmath21084 - 86 and  @xmath71085 lines .",
    "given @xmath0car s spectroscopic variability and probable binary nature , we anticipated that its fuv flux would significantly decrease as it approached the x - ray eclipse .",
    "however , a surprising amount of fuv flux was present in all lwrs spectra of @xmath0car .",
    "this resulted from spectral contamination of the lwrs observations by two 11th magnitude b stars , tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 ( feinstein et al .",
    "1973 ) , also members of tr16 , located just under 14  from @xmath0car  ( see fig[acsimage ] and table [ bstars ] ) .",
    "they lie just inside the edge of the lwrs aperture at all position angles .",
    "a third b - type star , tr16 - 66 , is located 200 from @xmath0car  and could , therefore , contribute to the lwrs flux only in a narrow range of aperture position angles ( p.a .",
    "= 16@xmath84 , and increments of 90 ) .",
    "hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) near - uv images from 2003 june 13 provide astrometry and uv photometry for these stars . the 2200   flux from tr16 - 64 is @xmath9 and the tr16 - 64:65:66 brightness ratio is 1.00:0.55:0.20 at 2200  .",
    "tr16 - 64 has spectral type b1.5v ( levato & malaroda 1982 ) . with tr16 membership , similar @xmath10 , visual and uv colors ( implying no significant extinction differences ) , tr16 - 65",
    "must also be an early b star .",
    "comparison of @xmath10 and uv brightnesses indicates that tr16 - 66 would contribute less than 10% of the combined fuv flux of tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 to lwrs observations .",
    "serendipitously , the aperture position angle and thermal alignment shifts during the lif1 hirs observations in 2004 april brought the sic1 hirs aperture to the location of tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 .",
    "examination of the time - tag data shows steady count rates in sic1 hirs for 48 out of 59 ks on april 9 and 10 .",
    "no signal from the b stars was present in the sic1 hirs channel on april 11 .",
    "although the exact sic1 , sic2 , and lif2 aperture locations during the lif1 hirs observation are not known , there are no other stellar sources of fuv flux within the range of hirs aperture motion .",
    "the b - star spectrum recorded in sic1 is a combination of tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 .",
    "the _ fuse _  lif1 hirs spectrum gives the intrinsic fuv spectrum of @xmath0car , without contributions from tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 .",
    "figure  [ lif1aplt]a shows the 10451090   region of this observation and the sic1a hirs spectrum of tr16 - 64 plus tr16 - 65 is shown in figure  [ lif1aplt]b .",
    "given the observed flux levels ( @xmath11 ) , a significant fraction of the flux of these stars was in the sic1 hirs aperture .",
    "the b stars and @xmath0car  share a rich interstellar spectrum that is characteristic of _ fuse _  spectra of other carina early - type stars ( e.g. , h@xmath12 , , , and ) .",
    "strong blue - shifted absorptions are also present in many transitions in the fuv spectrum of eta car .",
    "these include atomic lines also seen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and fe ii absorption from levels within 1000 @xmath13 of the ground state ( nielsen et al .",
    "2005 ; gull et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "these high - velocity features are seen in two principal groups ( @xmath14  kms@xmath15and @xmath16  kms@xmath15 ) .",
    "the stronger of these circumstellar features are marked in fig .",
    "[ lif1aplt]a as ` csm ' .",
    "there is no evidence of high - velocity absorption in the h@xmath12  lyman lines .",
    "the sic1 hirs spectrum ( figure  [ lif1aplt]b ) is characteristic of early main - sequence b stars ( see pellerin et al .",
    "the  1073 line shows only a photospheric line profile , that is no stellar wind feature in  1062 or 1073 , and indicates a low @xmath17 ( @xmath550  kms@xmath15 ) .",
    "figure [ lif1aplt]c shows that the addition of the lif1 hirs and sic1 hirs spectra very accurately reproduces the lwrs spectrum of @xmath0car  taken in 2004 march , indicating that the only significant sources of fuv flux in the lwrs aperture are @xmath0car  and the tr16 b stars .",
    "we now have the ability to extract the intrinsic fuv spectrum of @xmath0car  from other lwrs observations by subtracting the sic1 hirs spectrum of tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 .",
    "the point - source throughput of the hirs aperture is @xmath18% for targets centered in the aperture .",
    "the flux for the hirs spectra presented here have been corrected assuming a nominal 65% throughput . while this yields very satisfactory results , a uniform scaling of the hirs fluxes may in fact not be a unique solution .",
    "several lwrs spectra of @xmath0car  were obtained in 2003 june .",
    "the x - ray flux was decreasing during this time frame as @xmath0car  approached the x - ray eclipse .",
    "the lwrs spectra on june 10 and 17 are nearly identical to spectra obtained in 2004 mar .",
    "the spectrum on 2003 june 27 , however , is completely different , being nearly identical to the sic1a hirs spectra ( figure  [ lif1aplt]b ) .",
    "the 2003 june and 2004 march lwrs spectra with the b stars subtracted are shown in fig .",
    "[ diffspec ] .",
    "there is almost a complete cancellation on june 27 , with only a small amount of residual flux from @xmath0car   present in limited wavelength regions ( e.g. 10401046  ) . in the 1100 - 1185  region ,",
    "the june 27 spectrum has normal interstellar line profiles in many  lines ,  @xmath21134 , etc , ( r. iping et al.2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "all the strong high velocity absorption present in every other lwrs observation of @xmath0car  is not present , indicating that the primary source of fuv flux on that date is located outside of the @xmath0car  homunculus , that is the stars tr16 - 64 and tr16 - 65 .",
    "our results show that essentially all the fuv flux from @xmath0car  shortward of ly@xmath1  disappeared at least two days before the start of the x - ray eclipse ( 2003 june 29 , corcoran 2005 ) , implying that the source of the fuv flux was also eclipsed .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by _",
    "hst_space telecope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) observations .",
    "examination of archival stis fuv echelle spectra obtained with a 02@xmath603 slit in 2003 show that above 1300   there were increases in the strength of many absorption features on july 5 relative to earlier spectra . from @xmath31160 to 1200   the spectrum was little changed on june 22 compared with earlier observations , but on july 5 this region had nearly zero flux .",
    "the fuv flux shortward of 1000   implies that @xmath0carb  has a higher @xmath19  than @xmath0cara  ( @xmath19=15,000k ) .",
    "the hillier et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2005 ) model of @xmath0cara  fades significantly below ly@xmath1   and the flux from @xmath0carb  is expected to dominate @xmath0cara  only at these short wavelengths .",
    "verner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that @xmath0carb   should have @xmath19@xmath335,000 k in order to provide sufficient ionizing flux to excite weigelt blob emission .",
    "the _ fuse _  spectrum is consistent with this result .    the _ fuse _  wavelength region contains several features that should be key spectral diagnostics for the spectral classification and stellar wind properties of @xmath0carb .",
    "these include  @xmath21032 - 38 ,  @xmath21062 - 73 , ] @xmath71176 ,  @xmath71084 - 86 ,  @xmath21122 - 28 , and  @xmath71118 - 28 .",
    "few , if any , of these transitions are cleanly observed in the _ fuse _  spectrum of @xmath0car , at least not in the form of profiles seen in other ob stars ( see pellerin et al . 2002 ; willis et al .",
    "the strong , nearly saturated high - velocity  and * absorption by homunculus gas obliterates the  @xmath21122 - 28 and  1128 lines .",
    "the  @xmath21032 - 38 region does not have a clear p - cygni line profile , but the general depression of the 1025 - 1038   spectrum in @xmath0car  relative to the b stars is characteristic of late o supergiants ( e.g. hd 210809 , o9 iab , in pellerin et al .",

    "if formed in a wind of @xmath0carb , the  and ] features indicate a late - o spectral type .",
    "the 1085   region has a strong emission feature at 1085.8   ( fig .",
    "[ lif1aplt]a , fig .  [ windlines ] ) .",
    "this is the expected position for a p - cygni feature from the  @xmath21084 - 86 multiplet , and not emission from  @xmath71084.9 .",
    "significantly , this emission feature disappears in the june 27 observation , indicating that it is closely associated with @xmath0carb , and not @xmath0cara  or the surrounding nebulosity .",
    "the full width of the  emission is at least @xmath3 130  kms@xmath15 , although this is a lower limit because of strong interstellar absorption by * * @xmath71085.55 and @xmath71085.71 near their laboratory wavelengths ( about -450  kms@xmath15  in fig .",
    "[ windlines]c - d ) .",
    "the saturated absorption is consistent with other transitions that have strong high - velocity features ( @xmath20 to @xmath21  kms@xmath15 ) from the expanding ejecta of @xmath0car .",
    "a wind velocity of @xmath22  kms@xmath15  for @xmath0carb , as postulated in the pittard & corcoran ( 2002 ) colliding winds model , is not evident in our data .",
    "the upper limit on the wind velocity for @xmath0carb  is @xmath31100  kms@xmath15 , based on the  @xmath21062 and 1073 and ] @xmath21175 lines .",
    "the profiles significantly overlap the csm absorption velocities , making it more difficult to disentangle the two",
    ". the higher wind velocity of the pittard & corcoran model may not be observable if the wind of @xmath0carb  is highly distorted by the collision bowshock with the wind of @xmath0cara , but this effect could be phase dependent in the eccentric orbit of the model .",
    "_ fuse _  spectra of @xmath0car  and their timing relative to the x - ray light curve demonstrate that there is a second , hotter star in the @xmath0car  system .",
    "the _ fuse _  data do not conclusively identify the stellar type , but there are clues from several lines , including @xmath21084 - 86 .",
    "this line is not observed as a p - cygni profile in normal o stars ( pellerin et al .",
    "2002 , walborn et al .",
    "2002 ) ; it is _ only _ seen in late - type nitrogen - rich o and wolf - rayet stars ( see walborn et al . 2002 ; willis et al .",
    "this raises the possibility that @xmath0carb  could be nitrogen rich , and possibly a wolf - rayet star .",
    "our upper limit on the @xmath0carb  wind velocity is consistent with a late o / wr spectral type .",
    "alternatively , the  emission might arise from the colliding - wind shock interface and still be occulted during eclipse ingress .",
    "better understanding of the @xmath0car  system could come from integrated modeling of @xmath0carb  seen through the extended , expanding atmosphere and circumstellar material of @xmath0cara .",
