    "the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) [ 1 ] evolution equations are fundamental tools to study the @xmath5- and @xmath0-evolutions of structure functions , where @xmath0 is the bjorken scaling parameter and @xmath6 is the virtuality of the exchanged vector boson in a deep inelastic scattering process [ 2 ] .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath7 structure functions by deep inelastic scattering processes in the low-@xmath0 region have opened a new era in parton density measurements inside hadrons .",
    "the structure function reflects the momentum distributions of the partons in the nucleon .",
    "it is also important to know the gluon distribution inside a hadron at low-@xmath0 because gluons are expected to be dominant in this region .",
    "the steep increase of @xmath7 towards low-@xmath0 observed at the hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) also indicates a similar increase in the gluon distribution towards low-@xmath0 in perturbative quantum chromodynamics . in the usual procedure ,",
    "the deep inelastic scattering data are analyzed by the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd fits based on the numerical solution of the dglap evolution equations , and it has been found that the dglap analysis can well describe the data in the perturbative region @xmath8 [ 3 ] . as an alternative to the numerical solution , one can study the behavior of quarks and gluons via analytic solutions of the evolution equations . although exact analytic solutions of the dglap equations can not be obtained in the entire range of @xmath0 and @xmath6",
    ", such solutions are possible under certain conditions and are quite successful as far as the hera low-@xmath0 data are concerned .",
    "some of these methods [ 4 ] were proposed in the literature by using expansion method or pomeron behavior .",
    "+ the low-@xmath0 region of dis offers a unique possibility to explore the regge limit of pqcd [ 5 ] .",
    "this theory is successfully described by the exchange of a particle with appropriate quantum numbers and the exchanged particle is called a regge pole .",
    "phenomenologically , the regge pole approach to dis implies that the structure functions are sums of powers in @xmath0 , modulus logarithmic terms , each with a @xmath5- dependent residue factor . also , in the dglap formalism the gluon splitting functions are singular as @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the gluon distribution will become large as @xmath10 , and its contribution to the evolution of the parton distribution becomes dominant .",
    "in particular , the gluon will drive the quark singlet distribution , and , hence , the structure function @xmath11 becomes large as well , the rise increasing in steepness as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this model gives the following parametrization of the dis parton distribution functions @xmath12 at low-@xmath0 where @xmath13 is the parton density .",
    "this phenomenon is usually described by assuming a power - like behavior of parton distribution functions as @xmath14 , that the singlet part of the parton distribution functions are controlled by pomeron exchange at low-@xmath0 , where @xmath15 is the pomeron intercept minus one . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the simplest regge phenomenology predicts that the value of @xmath17 is consistent with that of hadronic regge theory , where @xmath18 is described by soft- pomeron dominant with its intercept slightly above unity ( @xmath19 ) , whereas for @xmath20 the slope rises steadily to reach a value greater than 0.4 by @xmath21 , where hard - pomeron is dominant [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "+ the one - loop splitting functions corresponding to lo dglap equation are given in ref.[8 ] .",
    "similarly the two - loop splitting functions governing the evolution have been known for a long term [ 9 ] .",
    "the effects of nlo [ 9 ] and nnlo [ 10 - 14 ] terms in the evolution parton structure functions are known to be important , especially at low-@xmath0 in the gluon and singlet sector .",
    "the calculation of the nnlo qcd approximation for the parton structure functions of dis is important for the understanding of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and for an accurate comparison of pqcd with experiment . to obtain the nnlo approximation for these parton structure functions one needs the corresponding three - loop splitting functions .",
    "traditionally , gluon and quark distribution functions have been determined using the two coupled integral - differential ( dglap ) equations to evolve individual quark and gluon distributions . here ,",
    "we propose a new method for determining the gluon and quark distribution functions by using the two decoupled homogeneous second - order differential equation which determine individual @xmath2 and @xmath22 , respectively . in the evolution parton structure functions and running coupling we take @xmath23 for @xmath24 , which at the starting scale of evolution at @xmath3 , we use the block fit [ 15,16 ] to zeus data [ 17 ] in the domain @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "+ the analytical methods of the unpolarized dglap evolution equations have been discussed considerably in @xmath0-space , mellin and laplace transformation [ 18,19,15 ] .",
    "some approximated analytical solutions of dglap evolution equations suitable at low-@xmath0 , have been reported in last years [ 4 ] with considerable phenomenological success .",
    "the distributions have been obtained using the coupled dglap evolution equations , in lo and nlo .",
    "recently , in ref.[20 ] decoupled solutions of the lo and nlo coupled dglap evolution equations have been obtained using laplace transformation .",
    "those results show that obtained solutions deepen on both initial condition of the gluon distribution function and singlet structure function at the initial scale .",
    "the decoupled solutions of the nlo dglap evolution equations ( with respect to the taylor series expanding and the hard - pomeron behavior ) found in ref.[21 ] at low-@xmath0 , where the gluon kernel is dominant . in the present paper ,",
    "such solutions can be generalised to nnlo by solving the decoupled dglap evolution equations at low-@xmath0 as both gluon and singlet kernels are dominant . in this paper",
    ", we will study the decoupling dglap evolution equations based on the hard - pomeron behavior of the gluon and individual quark distributions .",
    "the method gives a global gluon and quark distribution function in the @xmath0 and @xmath5 space which depend explicitly on the gluon and quark distribution individual at @xmath3 scale , respectively .",
    "+      the hera data should determine the low-@xmath0 behavior of gluon and singlet quark distributions .",
    "we will be concerned specifically with the singlet contribution to the proton structure function at lo , as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of active flavors . at low-@xmath0 and",
    "high-@xmath5 the singlet quark distribution is essentially driven by the generic instability of the gluon distribution @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the gluon density . to see how this works ,",
    "consider the singlet altarelli- parisi equations [ 1 ] , which describe perturbative evolution of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "+ the dglap evolution equations for the singlet quark structure function and the gluon distribution are given by            the next - to - leading order is the standard approximation for most important processes .",
    "the corresponding one- and two - loop splitting functions have been known for a long time .",
    "the nnlo corrections need to be included , however , in order to obtain a quantitatively reliable predictions for hard processes at present and future high - energy colliders .",

    "now let us introduce the hard - pomeron behavior for the parton structure functions .",
    "as it is well known , the parton structure functions obtained from fits to data follow an approximate power - law behavior [ 6 - 7 ] at low-@xmath0 , @xmath65 at given @xmath58 , where @xmath66 depend of course on the parton species and @xmath15 is taken as a hard trajectory intercept mines one .",
    "the power @xmath15 is found to be either @xmath67 or @xmath68 [ 25 ] .",

    "these decoupling equations are directly related to the initial conditions and to the strong interaction coupling constant at lo , nlo and nnlo . to determine the proton structure function and gluon distribution function we need to know only the input singlet and gluon densities and their derivatives at the initial scale of @xmath3 , respectively .",
