    "it can be seen that the zeros of @xmath44 are located at the lattice - site centers , implying that the raman potentials are parity odd relative to each lattice - site center .",

    ", one can readily set that @xmath186 , which is equivalent to put that @xmath48 , and then the hopping along the directions depicted by arrows in fig .  1 ( c ) of the main text acquires a phase @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to a staggered flux pattern with the flux @xmath187 in each square plaquette .",
    "\\(iv ) due to the odd parity of raman potentials , the hopping from one site to its leftward ( upward ) neighboring site has an additional minus sign relative to the hopping to its rightward ( downward ) neighboring site .    with these results in mind ,",

    "the simplest approach to detect the topology of a qah insulator is to measure the bloch eigenstates at only two or four highly symmetric points in the first brillouin zone , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the previous work",
    "it was shown that this approach is valid for qah insulators which satisfy the inversion symmetry defined by @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is a 2d spatial inversion operator transforming the bravais lattice vector @xmath233 and @xmath234 is a parity operator acting on the ( pseudo)spin space . in the present lattice system",
    "the unit cell is doubled relative to the original square lattice , and from the hamiltonian   one can check that no parity symmetry can be satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , we show below that this minimal measurement method can be still applied to the present system with a nontrivial generalization .    in the physical hamiltonian   the pauli matrices",
    "@xmath63 operate on the sublattice space . to complete our proof",
    ", we construct an artificial hamiltonian which is formally equivalent to eq .",
    "the only difference is that in the new hamiltonian we assume that @xmath236 act on a spin space which is independent of the position space . in this way",
    ", we know that the new hamiltonian @xmath237 is invariant under the following 2d inversion transformation on both the position and spin space @xmath238 where the transformation @xmath232 sends @xmath106 . therefore , at the four symmetric points @xmath107 the bloch states are also parity eigenstates with @xmath239 , and @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "the topology of the artificial insulating system can be determined by the following invariant  @xcite @xmath240=\\bigr[(-1)^{\\nu}\\bigr]^2=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the third line of the above equation we have defined that @xmath241.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the invariant for the constructed system @xmath242 .",
    "this indicates that the chern number for the hamiltonian @xmath237 should always be even @xmath243  @xcite .",
    "this result is easy to understand .",
    "as pointed out previously , for the original physical system the unit cell is doubled .",
    "accordingly , the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) of the original square lattice , denoted by @xmath244 is only half of the fbz @xmath245 for the constructed artificial system .",
    "the two momenta @xmath246 and @xmath247 correspond to the same point in @xmath244 ( note that @xmath60 is not the sublattice momentum , but the momentum of the original lattice system which includes both @xmath11 and @xmath12 sublattices ) .",
    "therefore , the chern number for the bloch hamiltonian @xmath237 reads @xmath248 from the number @xmath249 one can not tell the difference of a topological phase from a trivial phase . in the next step , we shall show that the topology of the artificial system can also be determined by the invariant @xmath250 which is defined in eq .   with the parity eigenvalues at @xmath251 and @xmath66 , half of the four parity - symmetric points in @xmath245 .",
    "the magnitudes @xmath118 and @xmath252 correspond to the topologically trivial and nontrivial states , respectively .",
    "then , together with the above relation , we can further use this invariant to characterize the topology of the original physical system .",
    "the proof is straightforward and is valid for any two - band system satisfying the following two conditions .",
    "first , the quantum anomalous hall phases are characterized by low chern numbers . in particular , for the artificial system it is @xmath253 and for the original physical system @xmath254 .",
    "second , the system can be adiabatically connected to the one obtained under a four - fold @xmath255 rotational transformation on such system . in other words ,",
    "the topology is not changed under the @xmath255 transformation in position and ( pseudo)spin space @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the @xmath174-rotation on the position space , transforming the bloch momentum @xmath258 .",
    "it is easy to see that the inversion symmetry in eq .",
    "is given by @xmath259 . by a direct check",
    "one can verify that the constructed system in our consideration belongs to the class of hamiltonians satisfying the above conditions .",
    "what we need to prove is that the transition between a trivial phase and a topological phase must be associated with the change from @xmath118 to @xmath260 .",
    "let the system be initially a trivial insulator . to have topological phase transition ,",
    "the bulk gap should close and reopen at some momentum points . around such momenta",
    "the bulk can be described by massive dirac hamiltonians , with the dirac masses changing signs during the transition .",
    "we denote one of the dirac momentum as @xmath261 .",
    "then , from the @xmath255 symmetry we know that there are four - fold of such dirac points @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) . moreover , from the relation between the artificial and original physical systems , we have that the momentum @xmath264 is also a dirac point . with these results in mind",
    ", we get that when a topological phase transition occurs , the dirac masses simultaneously reverse signs at following momenta ( not necessarily independent ) @xmath265 it is easy to know that there must be even number ( denoted as @xmath266 ) of dirac points in the above formula which are independent . on the other hand , from the symmetry we know that all these dirac points contribute the same chern number to the whole bulk invariant . before and after the phase transition the chern number changes by @xmath267 we have three different cases . first , if @xmath268 is an inversion symmetric point , e.g. @xmath269 , the eq .",
    "includes only two independent points , @xmath268 and @xmath270 .",
    "second , for the case with @xmath271 , the eq .",
    "includes four independent dirac points , i.e. @xmath272 .",
    "finally , for the rest cases all the @xmath273 momenta in eq .",
    "are independent .",
    "this implies that for the later two situations the chern number changes by @xmath274 and @xmath273 , respectively , while in the first case the chern number changes by @xmath275 . therefore ,",
    "for a system with low chern number , only the first situation can happen , namely , the bulk gap must close and reopen at two inversion symmetric momenta @xmath276 and @xmath277 ( or @xmath278 and @xmath279 ) .",
    "note that the dirac masses at these points are equivalent to the parity eigenvalues , so the topological phase transition must be associated with the sign change of corresponding parity eigenvalues , leading to the change of the invariant @xmath250 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to verify that the trivial phase with @xmath280 correspond to @xmath118 , and then the topological phases with @xmath281 are given by @xmath260 . together with the relation   we conclude that the invariant @xmath250 classfies the topology of the original physical system .",
    "this completes our proof .    since the parity operator is @xmath104 , the parity eigenvalues are the pseudospin eigenstates . to measure the parity",
    "eigenvalues one can measure the pseudospin polarization , i.e. the population difference of atoms between @xmath11 and @xmath12 sublattices , which can be measured with _ in situ _ imaging .",

    "the laser beam assisted hopping between neighboring sites without spin flip can apply far - detuned raman laser beams and therefore does no suffer from large spontaneous decay from excited states .",
    "the primary heating is induced by onsite two - photon raman transitions which do not drive neighboring - site hopping but convert the energy difference between two raman photons to mechanical energy of the lattice system  @xcite .",
    "note that in the present optical raman lattice , the raman potentials are antisymmetric with respect to each lattice site center , the intraband scattering ( @xmath124 bands ) is forbidden , and only the interband scattering ( @xmath125 bands ) can heat the system .",
    "this distinguishes essentially from the conventional schemes which applies plane - wave and red - detuned raman laser beams and have both interband and intraband onsite transitions  @xcite . to estimate the life time of the trapped cold atoms , we calculate the change rate of the mean - mechanical energy of an atom .",
    "for comparison , we consider both the present optical raman lattice system ( with the heating rate denoted as @xmath289 ) and the conventional laser - assisted schemes ( denoted as @xmath290 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath26-@xmath26 band onsite transition , e.g. from an initial state with momentum @xmath60 to the final state @xmath291 has the two - photon detuning @xmath292 , with @xmath293 the @xmath26-band spectrum .",

    "we have denoted by @xmath126 and @xmath305 the heating rates of the optical raman lattice system and the conventional lattice systems , respectively .",
    "typically the bandwidths of @xmath26 and @xmath130 bands are much less than the @xmath26-@xmath130 band gap which is @xmath129 .",
    "we then approximate that @xmath306 and @xmath307 , and @xmath308 for the parameter with @xmath309 , one can verify that @xmath310 . substituting this result into the equation of @xmath290",
    "we solve numerically that the minimum heating rate for @xmath305 is obtained by setting @xmath311 .",
    "namely , for the conventional laser - assisted - hopping schemes , the minimum heating ( denoted as @xmath127 ) requires that the frequency difference between raman lasers be close to the half of the @xmath26-@xmath130 band gap  @xcite . with these results in mind",

    "one can set the typical parameters that @xmath131 , and we have then @xmath132 , which shows that the present optical raman lattice has much less heating than that in the conventional schemes .",
