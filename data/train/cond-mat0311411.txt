    "soon after the realization of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases , an important development in this field has been the measurement of the frequencies and damping rates of collective excitations @xcite .",
    "these measurements are very accurate and provide a unique opportunity for quantitative tests of quantum theories of the dynamics of many - body systems . in particular , the measurements of the lowest - energy excitations made at jila @xcite on @xmath0rb gases at various temperatures have proved hard to understand at simple mean - field level @xcite and have therefore stimulated a number of theoretical studies to address effects beyond the mean - field approximation @xcite .    the key issue in investigations transcending the mean - field level is the _ full _ dynamic description of both condensed and non - condensed atoms and their mutual interactions @xcite .",
    "while the condensate dynamics is well described by a single nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , how to monitor the evolution of the non - condensate is a much more delicate problem .",
    "the best candidate theory that takes into account the coupled dynamics of condensate and non - condensate for a homogeneous weakly - interacting bose gas in the collisionless limit is the second - order beliaev - popov ( sobp ) theory @xcite , which has been reexamined recently by shi and griffin @xcite and extended to trapped gases by fedichev and shlyapnikov @xcite and by giorgini @xcite ( see also rusch _ et al . _",
    "however , for the trapped gas the thomas - fermi approximation on the sobp theory fails to account for the jila observations @xcite .",
    "one possible reason is that the dynamics of the condensate and non - condensate are not treated on an equal footing in the theory , _",
    "i.e. _ the dynamical coupling between fluctuations in the thermal cloud is not included .",
    "this coupling should be important when the thermal fraction is significantly populated and , as will be discussed below , is in fact needed to satisfy the generalized kohn theorem for the dipole modes .",
    "one way to include these processes is to use the linear response theory in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) as developed by two of us @xcite .",
    "such a treatment chooses the hartree - fock gas as the reference system for the thermal atoms , thus neglecting the anomalous density fluctuations that may play a role at intermediate temperatures .    in the present paper we improve on the hartree - fock rpa ( hf - rpa ) by including the anomalous density fluctuations .",
    "the resulting theory can be referred to as the hfb - rpa since our choice of the reference system is provided by the first - order hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory .",
    "we explicitly show that the hfb - rpa theory formally reduces to the sobp theory given by fedichev and shlyapnikov @xcite and by giorgini @xcite if ( i ) one excludes the process of driving the non - condensate by its self - generated dynamical potential , and ( ii ) one keeps only terms of second order in the coupling constant .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hf - rpa similarly reduces to the dielectric formalism given by reidl",
    "_ et al_. @xcite .",
    "we then numerically investigate the low - lying excitations of a fluid representing a bose - condensed gas of 2000 @xmath0rb atoms in a spherically symmetric harmonic trap at finite temperature by using the hfb - rpa as well as the sobp theory and the hf - rpa .",
    "all three theories give qualitatively the same results for the quadrupolar mode of the condensate .",
    "however they predict different trends for the monopolar mode , due to the strong coupling between the oscillations of the condensate and those of the non - condensate . for the first time this observation highlights the crucial roles played already in the linear excitation spectra by the normal and anomalous density fluctuations of the non - condensate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the generalized rpa equations within the framework of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation , and in sec .",

    "v and vi we present our numerical results for the low - energy excitations .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii presents our main conclusions .",
    "the essential idea of the rpa is that the gas responds as a reference gas to self - consistent dynamical potentials @xcite . in the hf - rpa treatment",
    "one chooses as dynamical variables the density fluctuations @xmath1 of the condensate and @xmath2 of the non - condensate @xcite .",
    "the hf - rpa equations follow by imposing that the condensed and non - condensed particles experience dynamical hartree - fock potentials generated by both types of density fluctuations and respond to them as a hartree - fock gas .    our starting point for the derivation of the hfb - rpa is the definition of the appropriate single - particle reference system .",
    "the contribution of the anomalous density is included by choosing the hartree - fock - bogoliubov gas at finite temperature as reference , which is defined in terms of the condensate wavefunction @xmath3 and of the single - particle amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the non - condensate @xcite .",

    "we would like to remark that from a dynamical point of view the amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath5 can alternatively be viewed as excitations out of the condensate .",
    "the duality of such mean - field description follows from the assumption of bose symmetry breaking ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .    in deriving next the hfb - rpa equations we adopt five dynamic variables , which are the fluctuations @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the condensate wavefunction and its complex conjugate , the normal density fluctuation @xmath2 , and the anomalous density fluctuation @xmath23 together with its complex conjugate @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath25 are separately introduced because of their different coupling to @xmath26 and @xmath24 , and are related to the density fluctuation of the condensate by @xmath27 .",
    "the hfb - rpa then follows naturally by evaluating the self - consistent dynamical hartree - fock - bogoliubov potential generated by the density fluctuations of the condensate ( phonon quasiparticles ) and of the non - condensate ( thermal quasiparticles ) .",

    "( [ schfb ] ) describe the self - potential of the thermal quasiparticles and are expected to excite zero - sound - like collective modes of the non - condensate .",
    "although these terms are only of third order in the coupling constant and therefore are missing in the sobp theory , they may have a significant role when the depletion of the condensate is large .",
    "they are also required for consistency with the generalized kohn theorem .    with the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov potential in eq .",

    "this discussion also allows us to define a rpa form of the sobp theory , that will later be used in our numerical calculations .    if we neglect the terms in @xmath2 , @xmath26 and @xmath64 on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "4 we show the spectral response of the dipole mode as obtained from the hfb - rpa with the same choice of parameters . in this approximation ,",
    "the generalized kohn theorem is not exactly satisfied , since a secondary peak is found in the spectrum at @xmath119 .",
    "according to the discussion given by lewenstein and you @xcite , a possible reason for this inaccuracy is the non - completeness of the set of quasiparticle wavefunctions used in the calculation .",
    "there also are appreciable distortions of the eigenvectors for the non - condensate oscillations in fig .",
    "we present in this section the numerical results of the hfb - rpa for the monopole and quadrupole modes and compare them with those given by the sobp - rpa and by the hf - rpa .",
    "these various theories give somewhat different results for the spectra at intermediate values of the temperature , in the range @xmath120 .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the hfb - rpa spectral functions at various temperatures . for @xmath121",
    "two main resonances are seen in each spectrum , which can be interpreted as representing the collective oscillations of the non - condensate and of the condensate .",
    "the oscillator strength of each resonance has been extracted from the spectra and is shown in fig .",
    "6 as a function of temperature .",
    "naturally , with increasing @xmath122 the amplitude of the non - condensate resonances grows ( empty circles ) while that of the condensate resonances decreases ( solid circles ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the modes in the two components of the gas are comparable with each other near @xmath123 , where the non - condensate fraction is populated by about @xmath124 for our choice of parameters . above this temperature",
    "the strength of the non - condensate resonances increases very rapidly .    in fig .",
    "7 we compare with each other the numerical results from the rpa theories for the monopolar and quadrupolar spectra at @xmath125 .",
    "we see that the hf - rpa and hfb - rpa closely agree in their predictions on the main non - condensate resonances for both types of excitations .",
    "we also see that all three theories predict essentially very similar results for the main quadrupolar resonance of the condensate , the position of the main peak at @xmath126 in fig .",
    "7(b ) being also in agreement with the result of the hfb - popov approximation ( not shown ) . in the following we concentrate on the main condensate resonance in the monopolar mode , for which the three theories give rather different predictions as is emphasized by the three arrows in fig .",
    "in fact , the partial spectra of condensate and non - condensate show an appreciable overlap in this frequency range , implying a stronger dynamical coupling between the breathing excitations of the two components of the gas and therefore an enhanced sensitivity to the approximations made in the theory .    to better illustrate the difference among the various theories , we extract the monopolar mode frequency of the condensate from the peak in @xmath127 and plot it in fig .",
    "8 as a function of reduced temperature . for comparison we also show the mode frequency given by the hfb - popov theory ( see sec .",
    "the most remarkable feature of fig .",
    "8 is that all three rpa theories show a _ non - monotonic _ behavior of the resonance as a function of temperature , in contrast with the prediction of the hfb - popov theory in which the resonance frequency decreases monotonically with increasing temperature .",
    "this difference is due to the dynamical coupling between the condensate and the non - condensate , which is neglected in the mean - field theory and becomes important as the non - condensate is significantly populated .",
    "let us now compare the three rpa theories , which transcend the mean - field level . at low temperature ( @xmath128 )",
    "we observe two different trends : the mode frequencies obtained from the hfb - rpa and from the sobp - rpa are in close agreement and move upwards with temperature , whereas the mode frequency predicted by the hf - rpa tends to decrease .",
    "the latter trend is in good agreement with the hfb - popov theory , in accord with the proof already given in ref .",
    "the upward trend of the mode frequency with temperature is manifested in all rpa theories at intermediate temperatures , reaching near @xmath129 the highest sensitivity to the detailed description of the physical process in which the thermal cloud is driven by its self - generated dynamical potential .",
    "finally , in proximity of the critical temperature all three theories tend to agree as the anomalous density fluctuations disappear .",
    "the fact that a large upward frequency shift is found with increasing temperature in both the sobp - rpa and the hfb - rpa suggests that a significant role is played by the anomalous density fluctuations . in fig .",
    "9 we show the partial density fluctuations which accompany the monopolar and quadrupolar condensate resonances at @xmath103 , as calculated from the hfb - rpa . in both modes",
    "we find that the anomalous density fluctuations are at this temperature at least comparable in magnitude to the fluctuations of the normal density .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a random - phase theory for the dynamics of a weakly interacting bose gas under external confinement at finite temperature . in the theory the dynamics of the condensate and of the thermal cloud are treated on the same footing and a previous hartree - fock random - phase scheme is extended through the inclusion of the anomalous density fluctuations .",
    "the theory satisfies with good numerical accuracy the generalized kohn theorem and correctly reduces to the second - order beliaev - popov theory if one neglects the process in which the thermal cloud is driven by its self - generated potential .",
    "it thereby fully includes the landau - beliaev damping mechanism .",
    "we have compared the theory with the second - order beliaev - popov theory and with the hartree - fock random - phase theory by numerical illustrations for a condensate of @xmath0rb atoms inside a spherical trap .",
    "the location of the main monopolar and quadrupolar resonances of the thermal cloud are well reproduced in the hartree - fock rpa and the frequency of the quadrupole mode of the condensate does not differ significantly from the mean - field hfb - popov prediction .",
    "we have instead found that for @xmath130 the temperature dependence of the breathing mode frequency of the condensate obtained from the various rpa theories is very different from the hfb - popov result .",
    "a significant role appears to be played in the dynamics of the bose - condensed gas by the anomalous density fluctuations of the thermal cloud at intermediate temperatures , even though they are known not to affect significantly the thermodynamics of the trapped gas @xcite .",
    "our results , though restricted to isotropic confinement , may be relevant in connection with the jila experiments @xcite , where the breathing mode in an anisotropic trap showed a frequency upshift with temperature which could not be accounted for by the hfb - popov theory @xcite .",

    "<S> the theory treats the motions of the condensate and of the non - condensate on an equal footing within a generalized random - phase approximation , which ( _ i _ ) extends the second - order beliaev - popov approach by allowing for the dynamical coupling between fluctuations in the thermal cloud , and ( _ ii _ ) reduces to an earlier random - phase scheme when the anomalous density fluctuations are omitted . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations of the low - lying spectra in the case of isotropic confinement show that the present theory obeys with high accuracy the generalized kohn theorem for the dipolar excitations and demonstrate that combined normal and anomalous density fluctuations play an important role in the monopolar excitations of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> mean - field theory is instead found to yield accurate results for the quadrupolar modes of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> although the restriction to spherical confinement prevents quantitative comparisons with measured spectra , it appears that the non - mean field effects that we examine may be relevant to explain the features exhibited by the breathing mode as a function of temperature in the experiments carried out at jila on a gas of @xmath0rb atoms . </S>"
