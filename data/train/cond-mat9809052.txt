    "since the advent of modern scaling concepts and renormalization - group techniques the study of finite - size and surface effects on the behavior of systems near or at criticality has attracted the attention of a number of investigators@xmath4 .    fixing our interest in the case of a system confined between two infinite ( @xmath5)-dimensional parallel plates distant @xmath1 from each other , we may classify three well defined distinct regions in this problem .",
    "the first one , where the scaling variable @xmath0 , is characterized by the dominance of bulk over surface and finite - size effects and the physics is quasi d - dimensional . here , @xmath2 specifies the critical correlation length above ( + ) and below ( @xmath6 ) the bulk critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the second region , where @xmath8 , the system behaves as a quasi ( @xmath5)-dimensional object . finally , for @xmath9 , the physics interpolates between a quasi @xmath10- and a quasi ( @xmath5)-dimensional system .",
    "a full description of the system should therefore unveil very interesting crossover behaviors .    according to the region and phenomenon of interest , different field - theoretic techniques",
    "have been devised to deal with such systems .",
    "indeed , diehl and dietrich@xmath11 successfully implemented these techniques to study critical and multicritical phenomena near surfaces within a finite momentum cutoff regularization scheme .",
    "the use of dimensional regularization was shown@xmath12 to simplify the computational procedure and allowed the study of ordinary@xmath13 and special transitions@xmath14 through standard @xmath15-field theories under dirichlet ( dbc ) and neumann ( nbc ) boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "the former mimics very strong repulsive forces at the surface , thus preventing order at it ( a parameter @xmath16 , which measures these forces@xmath13 , has fixed point value @xmath17 ) , whereas under the later boundary condition both the surface and the bulk go critical simultaneously .",
    "the special transition is in fact a multicritical point@xmath14 , @xmath18 , where the two lines describing systems with repulsive ( @xmath19 ) and attractive forces ( @xmath20 ) at the surface , meet . in the later case , namely the extraordinary transition@xmath21",
    ", the surface undergoes a second order transition before criticality sets in the bulk .",
    "moreover , it has been shown@xmath22 that a scaling description holds so that the critical exponents associated with excess surface singularities may be expressed completely in terms of bulk exponents .",
    "however , it has also been shown@xmath22 that fluctuations may induce divergences at the surface and in these cases local quantities and associated exponents must be defined resulting in new scaling relations .",
    "therefore , in treating these quantities at the multicritical point , neumann boundary conditions are valid only at the mean - field level@xmath22 .    on the other hand , in order to properly describe finite size effects using field - theoretic techniques in critical systems subject ,",
    "for example , to periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , brezin and zinn - justin@xmath23 and , independently , rudnick et al@xmath24 , introduced a method in which the zero - momentum component is isolated whereas the other non - zero modes are treated perturbatively .",
    "this methods has been largely used@xmath25 and generalized to study different boundary conditions .",
    "more recently@xmath26 , some difficulties to treat critical systems below @xmath7 using this technique have been circumvented .    both finite size and surface effects are simultaneously present , except in special circumstances such as for pbc where surface effects do not contribute . at @xmath27 , where casimir forces manifest , these contributions compete in a very special way , and powerful tools and methods such as conformal invariance@xmath28 and elaborated perturbation techniques@xmath29 have been used to study this regime and the approach to @xmath30 .    in this work",
    "we shall calculate specific heat and susceptibility amplitude ratios using field - theoretic and @xmath31-expansion methods@xmath32 particularly suitable to describe systems in the first regime mentioned above in which bulk behavior dominates over surface and finite size contributions .",
    "the reported results complement previous studies@xmath32 and shed some light on the approach to bulk criticality as the distance @xmath1 between the plates increases .    for a system of volume @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a ( @xmath5)-dimensional surface ( layered geometry ) , the following asymptotic scaling form for the singular part of the free energy density holds@xmath35 : @xmath36    where @xmath37",
    ", @xmath38 is the bulk correlation length exponent and @xmath39 is the only non - universal metric factor . using the hyperscaling relation @xmath40 , one identifies the first term ( proportional to @xmath41 ) as the bulk contribution , the second one ( proportional to @xmath42 ) as the excess surface term and the last one as a finite - size correction term . in the limit @xmath43 one expects exponentially small corrections from @xmath44 , whereas for @xmath45 it compensates the bulk and surface contributions and gives rise to the casimir effect@xmath46 at @xmath47 .    from the above scaling assumptions the specific heat and susceptibility should behave as @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the bulk critical exponents , but even in the regime @xmath51 one expects that excess surface and finite - size contributions modify their critical amplitudes in a non - trivial manner . in fact , the ratio of these amplitudes are quite sensitive in identifying the universality class of a critical system , particularly in numerical simulations@xmath52 where one has to control both corrections to scaling and surface and finite size effects .",
    "in section ii we explain our method and derive both the renormalized free energy and the equation of state from which the above quantities can be calculated .",
    "finally , in section iii a discussion of the results and conclusions are presented .",
    "in this section we shall use field - theoretic and renormalization - group techniques to calculate the amplitude ratios of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in layered geometries .",
    "we shall keep close contact with standard bulk @xmath55field theory@xmath56 and whenever necessary to deal with the finite size of the system we employ methods@xmath32 which are particularly suitable in the regime @xmath0 .",
    "we start by writing the expression for the one - loop renormalized helmholtz free energy density at the fixed point associated with the bulk critical behavior of the system : @xmath57   \\hspace{0.5cm}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the equation above @xmath58 are the renormalized ( bare ) reduced temperature and order parameter , respectively , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are renormalization functions , @xmath61 is the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant of a continuous ( bulk ) @xmath15 theory at the fixed point , @xmath62 is a @xmath63-dimensional wave vector along the direction parallel to the plate , @xmath64 are the eigenvalues of the kinetic energy operator satisfying proper boundary conditions ( see below ) and @xmath65 + { \\cal o } ( \\in ) $ ] is the one - loop integral of a bulk @xmath15 theory evaluated at the symmetry point using dimensional regularization , where @xmath66 .",
    "notice that taking the @xmath67 in eq.(4 ) one obtains the standard expression for the d - dimensional @xmath15 one - loop renormalized free energy .",
    "in deriving @xmath68 we have considered that the local field of a @xmath15 theory may satisfy periodic ( pbc ) , neumann ( nbc ) or dirichlet ( dbc ) boundary conditions , defined by : @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , where @xmath72 is a @xmath63-dimensional position vector perpendicular to the @xmath73 direction .",
    "it then follows that the sum in eq.(4 ) have values @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , ... , for pbc , @xmath77 for nbc , and @xmath78 for dbc , respectively .",
    "the local field is fourier transformed in the form@xmath32 @xmath79    where @xmath80 are plane waves parallel to the plate and @xmath81 are eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator @xmath82 with eigenvalues @xmath83 .",
    "the bare order parameter @xmath84 is thus the expectation value of the local field above .",
    "we call attention that the usual counterterms of a bulk @xmath15 theory are used to renormalize the free energy and that the boundary conditions are implemented on the bare vertex functions . details of the feynman rules involving propagators and vertices can be found in ref.(16 ) .",
    "since the vertex function @xmath85 is additively renormalized , the critical behavior ( singular part ) of the specific heat is calculated using the expression@xmath56 : @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the inhomogeneous term of the renormalization group equation for @xmath88 and @xmath89    for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and we find , using eqs.(4 ) and ( 7 ) @xmath92    whereas for @xmath93 we use the value of @xmath94 at the coexistence curve , namely @xmath95 , to obtain @xmath96    the one - loop integrals are evaluated using dimensional regularization and some useful formulae@xmath97 to sum infinite series .",
    "we thus obtain for the boundary conditions of interest : @xmath98 sin [ \\pi ( 5-d)/2 ] f_{(5-d)/2 } \\left [ \\frac{l \\tilde{t}^{(5-d)/2}}{2^{\\sigma } \\pi } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\tau \\frac{\\pi^{1/2}}{2 } \\gamma ( d/2 ) \\gamma [ ( 5-d)/2 ] \\ ;",

    "first , we should point out that the main step in our approach is the representation@xmath97 used to evaluate the discrete sums in eqs.(10 ) and ( 19 ) .",
    "it has proved very useful in different field - theoretic contexts@xmath137 and here it clearly helps to split the bulk , surface and finite size contributions , as required by scaling [ see eqs.(1 - 3 ) ] , in a rather simple way , though its range of effectivenes precludes direct access to the casimir effect .",
    "second , our starting renormalized free energy ,",
    "eq.(4 ) , does not consider any distortion of the order parameter profile , i.e. , our description is restricted to calculating the effect of the boundary conditions on bulk quantities as a result of fluctuations , i.e. , in the amplitude ratios , eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 24 ) , excess surface and finite size contributions are of @xmath138 .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that if the excess surface contributions for nbc in eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) are isolated , we find @xmath139 , which is the same result derived in ref.(5 ) for the special transition ( the excess surface specific heat exponent is @xmath140 ) .",
    "this is so because in this particular case there is no distortion of the order parameter at the mean - field level .",
    "notice also that , above @xmath7 , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 refer to the specific heat amplitudes at the special ( nbc ) and ordinary ( dbc ) transitions , a result already derived in ref.(4 ) . as for the excess surface contributions for the susceptibility",
    "amplitudes we also notice that the last term in eq.(20 ) is consistent with the result found in ref.(7 ) for the special transition above @xmath7 @xmath143 , since again no distortion of the order parameter is necessary in this case .    from the discussion above and the derived results in section ii , particularly eqs.(14 - 17 ) and ( 24 - 27 )",
    ", it is clear that in the regime @xmath144 , and to first - order in an @xmath31-expansion , the specific heat and susceptibility display singularities well described by bulk exponents , but with amplitudes sensitive to the boundary conditions which manifest as excess surface and finite size contributions .",
    "notice also that these fluctuation effects result quite effectively from the difference between the amplitudes of the correlation length above and below @xmath7 , which satisfy @xmath145 .    in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 we plot the scaling functions @xmath110 and @xmath146 , numerically evaluated in @xmath147 , as defined by eq.(11,15,25 - 27 ) .",
    "they both decay very rapidly to zero as @xmath148 increases , in agreement with the asymptotic result@xmath97 for @xmath149 , @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , for pbc and @xmath150 we find @xmath151 both by using the numerical estimate and the asymptotic result predicted in eq.(17 ) . for this value of @xmath152",
    "it is indeed expected@xmath52 that these corrections to the bulk limit are indeed negligible .",
    "notice that for nbc the magnitude of the scaling functions are the same in our one - loop approximation , in agreement with ref.(16 ) .",
    "however , a two - loop calculation shows@xmath32 that they slightly differ if the same regime of validity applies .",
    "however , as @xmath153 our approach does not correctly describe the casimir effect , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 : @xmath110 diverges and @xmath146 approaches zero , whereas in a correct treatment@xmath46 both tend to a constant value , the casimir amplitudes for each case .",
    "this failure for @xmath154 has already been pointed out by nemirovsky and freed@xmath32 . here , our results deal with issue in a more quantitative way , thus evidencing the advantages , limitations and drawbacks of the method .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot in fig .",
    "1 the excess surface contribution for the cases of both nbc and dbc , i.e. , @xmath155 . as clearly seen from figs . 1 and 2 , as @xmath115 these contributions are the leading ones@xmath156 modifying the amplitudes of both the bulk specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "notice that they having the same magnitude and decay as @xmath157 ( this is fortuitously true only because these effects are treated as fluctuation contributions to the bulk limit , see eqs .",
    "( 16,26 ) ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "4 we plot the difference between the excess surface contribution and the scaling function for nbc .",
    "we see that this difference `` almost '' saturates as @xmath153 , as expected in the casimir effect , but lostly it diverges for very small values of @xmath152 ( a @xmath157 dependence is in fact expected from eq . ( 11 ) as @xmath153 , but an extra ln@xmath152 contribution precludes a good description of the casimir effect ) .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a field - theoretic description of the approach to bulk criticality in parallel plate geometries , in which excess surface and finite - size contributions appear as a result of fluctuations and depend on the boundary condition imposed on the system . despite the fact that other more general methods to deal with finite systems do exist ,",
