    "there has been strong interest in the cosmological consequences of admitting a ultra - stiff fluid , whose isotropic pressure exceeds its energy density in the early stages of the universe .",
    "this situation could occur in a number of scenarios created by attempts to develop non - singular descriptions of spacetime which are applicable at arbitrarily early cosmological epochs .",
    "the simplest example is that provided by a scalar field , @xmath0 , with a negative potential energy , @xmath1 , in a homogeneous and isotropic universe , so that the pressure - density ratio is    @xmath2and for @xmath3 we can have @xmath4 in a regime where @xmath5 .",
    "this scenario can arise in the so called ekpyrotic @xcite , or cyclic , universe scenarios described by gasperini and veneziano @xcite and erickson et al @xcite , but can also occur in other theories containing effective scalar fields , for example in some compactifications in higher - dimensional theories @xcite . as a result , several authors have investigated the cosmological consequences of the presence of a simple , ultra - stiff , @xmath6 perfect fluid .",
    "erickson et al @xcite and lidsey @xcite showed that an ultra - stiff perfect fluid renders the isotropic friedmann universe stable as an initial or final singularity is approached in general relativistic cosmologies .",
    "this is quite different to the situation when @xmath7 , where isotropic expansion is unstable on approach to initial and ( if present ) final singularities .",
    "theorems were proved to establish this stability , a form of cosmic no - hair theorem , for homogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies , where the problem reduces to the analysis of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "the results are intuitively obvious for perfect fluids : there is no form of curvature or expansion anisotropy can diverge faster than @xmath8 as the mean scale factor @xmath9 , but a fluid with @xmath10 the density will diverge isotropically as @xmath11 in the same limit and dominate the anisotropic stresses in the @xmath12 limit when @xmath6 . if a real fluid with rotational motion is present then the vortical energy density , @xmath13 , goes to zero in the same limit , since by conservation of angular momentum @xcite it evolves as @xmath14 as @xmath12 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    this stability of the isotropy and homogeneity of the friedmann solution as @xmath18 is a very important ingredient for cyclic cosmologies because it permits a regular transition from collapse to expansion from cycle to cycle .",
    "if the isotropic expansion were unstable as @xmath12 then huge irregularities and anisotropies would accumulate and the successive cycles would be very different and increasingly anisotropic . in particular , attempts to follow small inhomogeneous perturbations through the bounce would fail @xcite .    in this paper we will show that the studies of the likely evolution of cosmological models as @xmath12 when pressures can exceed energy density have only considered a restricted situation in which the ultra - stiff pressures are isotropic . when anisotropic pressures are also present the stability of the friedmann solution fails as the initial and final singularity is approached and the cyclic scenario loses this appealing feature .",
    "earlier analyses of the @xmath19 cosmological problem have restricted their attention to the situation where the pressure is isotropic @xcite . however",
    ", if anisotropic pressures are present we should also expect the principal pressure components @xmath20 to be able to range over values that exceed @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to a violation of the dominant energy condition , ( which requires @xmath22 for each @xmath23 , @xcite ) .",
    "physically , anisotropic pressures are to accompany anisotropic expansion at very high energies because asymptotically - free interactions become collisionless when @xmath24 and gravitons will be collisionless below the planck energy scale ( @xmath25 ) . thus , if there is any expansion anisotropy , these collisionless particles will redshift ( or even blueshift ) at different rates in different directions and create significant anisotropic stresses with some ( or all ) experiencing @xmath26 .",
    "the evolution as the universe expands is complicated and has been studied in detail for the @xmath27 situation , especially for the radiation and dust - dominated eras when @xmath28 or @xmath29 , for evolution away from the singularity to the present skew , lukash . here",
    ", we will be interested in the behaviour of the cosmology in the limit of approach to the initial singularity with isotropic and anisotropic fluids both present . in order to establish a failure of the cosmic no - hair approach to the friedmann solution it suffices to consider only the simple bianchi type i universe .",
    "more complicated bianchi type universes will provide further scope for anisotropic stresses to dominate but we will not include them here .",
    "throughout this paper , we make use of orthonormal frame formalism developed by ellis et al @xcite . as a simple introduction we will consider an anisotropic bianchi type i universe containing a perfect fluid with ultra - stiff equation of state @xmath30where @xmath6 is a constant , as above .",
    "we assume the fluid 4-velocity vector @xmath31 is orthogonal to the homogeneous space - like hypersurfaces .",
    "we use an orthonormal tetrad so that einstein equations and bianchi identities are put into the following form : @xmath32where @xmath33here , @xmath34 is hubble parameter ( mean expansion rate ) , @xmath35 is the traceless shear expansion tensor , and @xmath36 is angular velocity of the tetrad frame with respect to a fermi - propagated frame . we define proper time @xmath37 by @xmath38and denote the time derivative with respect to @xmath37 by overdot .",
    "greek indices are used for space components of the tetrad .",
    "we can use the freedom to choose the space tetrad to diagonalise @xmath39 .",
    "the shear evolution equations then imply @xmath40    as is the case for the flrw universe , these equations are not independent . to single out the dynamical degrees of freedom , we introduce expansion - normalised variables : @xmath41since we are interested in the evolution of the universe during its expansion",
    ", we also define a dimensionless time @xmath42 by @xmath43and a mean scale factor by @xmath44we see that @xmath45and therefore the initial singularity ( @xmath46 ) corresponds to @xmath47 . denoting @xmath42 derivatives by primes , we have @xmath48with an auxiliary equation @xmath49and a decoupled equation @xmath50these equations can be readily integrated to give @xmath51where @xmath52 are integration constants satisfying @xmath53while the constant @xmath54 can be absorbed into the definition of time . since @xmath6 , we see that @xmath55 when the universe is `` small '' , near any initial singularity at @xmath46 .",
    "if we take the general bianchi i metric @xmath56the corresponding kinematic variables are given by @xmath57the results for expansion normalised variables are translated into metric language as @xmath58when @xmath42 @xmath59 @xmath60 , the asymptotic behaviour is @xmath61and the universe becomes isotropic . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath42 is large , we have @xmath62this is the kasner vacuum metric with kasner indices @xmath63we conclude that the universe become fluid - dominated and isotropic on approach to the singularity .",
    "this is in accord with the results of erickson et al @xcite and lidsey @xcite .",
    "we will now investigate how the above result is modified by the presence of an ultra - stiff anisotropic fluid in addition to an ultra - stiff isotropic fluid . as a simple model we take the total energy - momentum tensor to be @xmath64where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a constant traceless ( and has to be symmetric to be consistent with the metric ) tensor describing the ratio between energy density and anisotropic stresses ( note that momentum flow is not allowed in bianchi i ) .",
    "this form for the anisotropic stress tensor is characteristic of electromagnetic fields and many other anisotropic stresses in the early universe ( see ref @xcite for a fuller discussion ) although cosmological yang - mills fields require a different form of anisotropic stress tensor @xcite .",
    "the governing equations are modified and become @xmath67again , diagonalising shear tensor @xmath39 gives @xmath68as the off - diagonal parts of ( [ eq : shear ] ) are just defining relations for @xmath36 and are non - dynamical . for later convenience ,",
    "we introduce @xmath69where the pre - factors are chosen so that @xmath70these variables are sufficient to describe shear expansion tensor because they are traceless . the sub - case with @xmath71",
    "is the axisymmetric bianchi type i metric .",
    "the remaining equations are then rewritten as @xmath72with the definitions @xmath73describing the pressure anisotropies . as the previous section , we introduce an expansion - normalised variable for the density : @xmath74the equations are cast into the set @xmath75these equations no longer solve exactly but the qualitative and asymptotic behaviour of the system can be determined .",
    "the system described by equations ( [ eq : a ] ) to ( [ eq : e ] ) is three - dimensional and compact because of the constraint ( [ eq : e ] ) .",
    "we denote the entire system by @xmath76 .",
    "first , we have to find lower - dimensional invariant subsets .",
    "it turns out there are three which play important roles .",
    "they are defined as follows :    bianchi i : :    @xmath77 anisotropic fluid : :    @xmath78 aligned to stress vector @xmath79 : :    @xmath80    all of these are two - dimensional subsets ; @xmath81 and @xmath82 lie in the boundary of the whole space .",
    "if we take @xmath83 and @xmath84 as independent variables , @xmath85 looks like an inverted bowl with parabolic surface and @xmath86 is a vertical slice passing through the axis of symmetry . the subset @xmath87 is the base of the bowl and was already discussed in section 3 .    at this point , it is instructive to introduce polar coordinate for shear variables defined by @xmath88accordingly , we parametrise the shear tensor by @xmath89 in these coordinates @xmath0 measures the angle around the kasner circle and @xmath90 ( and @xmath91 ) corresponds to @xmath92 .",

    "time derivatives of all the normalised variables vanish at an equilibrium point and it corresponds to a self - similar solution .",
    "they are most conveniently characterised by defining the parameter @xmath94which measures the stiffness of the anisotropic fluid compared to the isotropic one .",
