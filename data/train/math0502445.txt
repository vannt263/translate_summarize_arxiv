    "in @xcite khovanov defined a link homology theory categorifying the coloured jones polynomial .",
    "he constructed a cochain complex associated to an oriented framed link whose components are labelled by irreducible representations of @xmath0 with the property that the graded euler characteristic of the homology of this complex is the coloured jones polynomial .",
    "his key idea is to interpret the formula @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-cable of the knot @xmath4 , as the euler characteristic of a complex involving the link homology of the cablings @xmath5 , for @xmath6 .",
    "cabling a knot or link immediately introduces an unmanagable number of crossings from a computational point of view .",
    "thus explicit computations in coloured khovanov theory are scarce .",
    "it is interesting therefore to follow khovanov s prescription for categorifying the coloured jones polynomial but in doing so replacing his original theory with a simpler link homology theory . in this paper",
    "we do this using the theory constructed by bar - natan in @xcite .",
    "to be more precise we use the singly graded ( filtered ) theory which is defined over @xmath7 obtained by setting the variable @xmath8 in @xcite to be 1 . in @xcite this was computed explicitly following the techniques of lee @xcite .",
    "the resulting `` coloured '' invariants will not be particularly interesting _ per se _",
    "( cf computations of lee s theory or bar - natan theory where the homology only depends on the linking matrix of the link ) , however as a testing ground for categorifying `` coloured '' invariants such a simple theory is invaluable .",
    "also as rasmussen s remarkable paper @xcite shows , important topological information can be extracted by considering the associated filtration of a simple theory ( in his case lee s theory ) .    in section",
    "[ sec : csbnt ] we begin by recalling khovanov s categorification of the coloured jones polynomial and follow this by the definition and calculation of bar - natan theory .",
    "this categorification procedure can be carried out for any link homology and we proceed by using bar - natan theory in place of khovanov s theory leading to the definition of what we call _ coloured bar - natan theory_. we calculate this explicitly for knots in section [ sec : knots ] where the main results are theorem [ thm : knots1 ] and theorem [ thm : grading ] . we extend this to links in theorem [ thm : links ] of section [ sec : links ] .",
    "finally we end with a short section on an alternative definition of the coloured theory suggested by khovanov .",
    "let @xmath9 be an oriented framed link with each component labelled by an irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "such representations are parametrized by @xmath10 , thus a coloured link is a link with each component labelled or coloured by a natural number .",

    "a typical dot - row can be seen in figure [ fig : dotrow ] , where @xmath14 .",
    "given a dot - row @xmath15 set @xmath16 number of pairs in @xmath15 . consider the oriented graph whose vertices are dot rows and which has an arrow from @xmath15 to @xmath17 if and only if all pairs in @xmath15 are pairs in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "now attach to the vertex @xmath15 of this graph the link @xmath19 , where here @xmath20 means the @xmath21-cable of the diagram @xmath13 .",
    "each single dot in the dot - row corresponds to a cable - strand .",
    "such a cable is oriented such that adjacent cable - strands have opposite orientations . to an edge @xmath22 with tail @xmath15 and head @xmath17 attach the cobordism @xmath23 which is the identity everywhere except at the two single dots in @xmath15 corresponding to the extra pair in @xmath17 .",
    "for these two strands , the cobordism is the annulus with two inputs and no outputs .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : edgecob ]        the cochain complex for the coloured theory is now obtained by applying khovanov homology to this graph of links and link - cobordisms .",

    "coloured khovanov theory is then defined as the homology of this complex , that is @xmath30    each @xmath31 is bigraded via the bigrading in khovanov homology and this induced a trigrading on @xmath32 .",
    "we write @xmath33 this defines a three variable polynomial @xmath34 from which one recovers the coloured jones polynomial as @xmath35 in @xcite khovanov shows that all the above is well defined and can be extended to coloured links , yielding an invariant of framed links .",

    "for this smoothing one can divide the circles into two disjoint groups , group 0 and group 1 as follows .",
    "a circle belongs to group 0 ( group 1 ) if it has the counter - clockwise orientation and is separated from infinity by an even ( odd ) number of circles or if it has the clockwise orientation and is separated from infinity by an odd ( even ) number of circles .",
