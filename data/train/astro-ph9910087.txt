    "the recognition of the existence of stellar populations differing for age , chemical composition , spatial distribution and kinematical properties has been the fundamental breakthrough in the knowledge of galactic structure , and the basis for models of galaxy formation and evolution ( see , e.g. , the review by majewski 1993 ) .",
    "the large subsample of the hipparcos catalogue for which radial velocity and proper motions are available appears a promising tool to attempt a description of the local behaviour of stellar populations .",
    "the derived database is largely incomplete and heterogeneous , and various steps will be necessary to be able to reach a conclusion . with due caution , it is possible to form an idea of the variations in age and heavy element abundance with variations in kinematics , i.e. , in the components @xmath10 , of star space velocity in the galaxy . the necessary information on metal content is obtained ( for part of the selected objects ) from existing catalogues . on the basis of these data and of theoretical isochrones",
    "we check that differences in  correspond to the expected differences in : this will allow to interprete the observed colour of the main sequence location in terms of metal content .",
    "we examine also the behaviour of stellar orbit eccentricities as function of space velocity , which gives a picture of the local galactic structure consistent with the one suggested by star distribution as function of metal content .",
    "the results we obtain are valid for the solar neighbourhood ; in the limits in which this region is representative of the body of the galaxy , such results can give hints on galactic structure on a larger scale .",
    "we extracted from the hipparcos catalogue ( esa 1997 ) the single objects with an error on the parallax @xmath11/@xmath12 @xmath13 0.15 and @xmath14 @xmath13 0.1 , for which estimates of the radial velocity were found in the literature ( turon et al .",

    "we accepted recognized periodic variables ( total number 267 ) .",
    "we also considered single objects for which @xmath15/@xmath12 @xmath6 1 ( total number about 18000 , 810 periodic variables ) only for comparison purpose . known or suspected non - single stars",
    "have been excluded on the basis of hipparcos catalogue indications .",
    "[ zdep ]    the velocity sample obtained above is not complete and suffers from many biases , which will be discussed in the following section .    from the velocity sample we extracted those objects having estimates of the metal abundance , on the basis of the catalogue by cayrel de strobel et al .",

    "cayrel s catalogue is a compilation from several sources , so that its data are rather inhomogeneous .",
    "furthermore , for many objects more than one value of  is given : in this case , we selected the most recent value , in the hypothesis that it is the most reliable one .",
    "of course this is not always correct , but it should be at least statistically true .    in first instance , the sample has been used to determine the mean location of the main sequence as a function of , in order to make sure that the of a main sequence star in the velocity sample is generally well related to its metal content .",
    "we used the ( @xmath0 , ) magnitudes and colours in the johnson @xmath16 photometric system provided by the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "the absolute magnitudes have been calculated without any allowance for interstellar reddening .",

    "they found that the separation in colour among main sequences with different metal content is lower than expected theoretically , a result supported by bartkevicius et al . and",

    "1 , where objects of different metallicity are shown together with two main sequence loci with @xmath17  and 0.02 , taken as reference lines .",
    "contrary to what found in precedence , on the average main sequence loci move progressively toward redder colours with increasing .",
    "we attribute this difference to the larger size of the present sample and to a better estimate of the metal content , based on the latest edition of cayrel et al.s catalogue ( 1997 ) .",
    "a more quantitative approach is described in the appendix , where we compare the expected value of @xmath18  with the observed one . with some caution",
    ", it appears possible to follow changes in populations of different metal content through changes in main sequence loci .",
    "this will allow to interprete the cm diagrams we shall construct for the stars for which we have the space velocity but not [ fe / h ] .",
    "in first instance we examine the sample given by the hipparcos survey , complete to between the 8th and 9th mag for stars with 0 @xmath6  @xmath6 0.8 , according to galactic position ( perryman et al .",
    "1989 ) ; objects with  @xmath1 0.8 are complete to a slightly lower magnitude .",
    "the survey limiting magnitude is sufficient to provide a good definition of the turn - off region for the oldest stars (  about 4 @xmath19 5 mag ) up to galactic velocities close to those of the halo ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "in table 1 we give the distribution of main sequence stars in the hipparcos survey ( about 23400 objects ) with and @xmath15/@xmath12 , considering for the latter quantity the intervals 0 to 0.15 , 0.15 to 1 and larger than 1 .",
    "thirteen objects have been excluded because they did not fulfill the condition on the colour error @xmath14 @xmath13 0.1 .",
    "as expected , the objects with the largest errors ( @xmath15/@xmath12 @xmath1 1 ) have  @xmath6 0 : we shall not consider them , since both their magnitude and velocity would turn out totally unreliable ( their number is less than 150 ) . for  @xmath1 -4 mag",
    "the majority of the objects has @xmath15/@xmath12 @xmath6 1 , for  @xmath1 1 mag the majority has @xmath15/@xmath12 @xmath13 0.15 .",
    "the turnoff age at  = 1 is @xmath20 yr , thus the stars with large parallax errors are mostly younger .",

[ eccen ]",
    "we obtained an estimate of the eccentricity of our velocity and metallicity sample adopting the eggen , sandage and lynden - bell ( els ) galactic potential ( eggen et al .",
    "1962 ) , which considers the @xmath21 and @xmath0 components only and therefore computes the eccentricity of the orbit projected onto the galactic plane , assuming the independence of the motion on this plane from the perpendicular one .",
    "this approximation of the galactic potential has been used by many authors beside eggen et al .",
    "( e.g. , carney et al 1990 , chiba & yoshii 1998 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the use of this potential overestimates the eccentricity ( yoshii & saio 1979 ) .",
    "we adapted the els potential to the updated values of the distance of the sun from the galactic center @xmath22 and of the circular velocity @xmath23 at the sun position , using the values of 8.5 kpc and 220 km @xmath2 , respectively ( kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) .",
    "we checked that a change in these parameters of the order of their errors ( @xmath24  10% ) does not influence substantially the results : the variations rarely reach @xmath24  0.04 and the square root of their quadratic mean is @xmath6 0.03 .    in fig .",
    "10 the behaviour of the eccentricity is shown as function of @xmath25 , for the four values of  considered above .",
    "when  = 0 , 76% of the objects have eccentricities @xmath13 0.2 ; for  = -0.3 the percentage becomes 63% , and for  = -0.6 , 28% ( for  = + 0.3 , the percentage is 86 % ) . comparing this behaviour with the one in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , one finds again that objects with  = -0.6 ( @xmath24 0.15 ) have a motion in the galaxy largely not confined on the galactic plane .",
    "the eccentricities of the sample with  = -0.3 being similar to the ones relative to  = 0 , the change at  = -0.6 appears rather sudden .",
    "some kinematical features of the local population have been identified . the first row in table 3",
    "gives the values of the space velocity components for which very young stars are found .",
    "the presence of low age objects and the rapidly rotating configuration may be taken to define the thin disk .    for @xmath0",
    "@xmath6 -40 , @xmath26 @xmath1 60 and @xmath27 @xmath1 30 km @xmath28 the minimum stellar age is about 2 @xmath7 yr . the disappearance of the younger stellar component may be assumed to mark the transition to the thick disk .    for @xmath0 @xmath6 -80 , @xmath26 @xmath1 100 and @xmath27 @xmath1 60 km @xmath28 the stellar population exhibit a common age @xmath29 @xmath3 yr . for increasing values of @xmath30 no substantial increase in age",
    "is observed , while the average location of the main sequence shifts more and more to the blue .",
    "the metal poor component (  @xmath6 4 @xmath31 ) is best isolated by the condition @xmath0 @xmath6 -180 km @xmath2 ( halo population ) .    for what concerns",
    "the chemical composition , we notice the departure from a rapidly rotating configuration ( -30 @xmath32 10 km @xmath2 ) at about -0.6 ; this kinematical change is possibly related to the age increase mentioned before , which takes place at similar values of this space velocity component .",
    "the common age for large space velocity suggests that no substantial age spread exists in the inner halo , at least in the local sample .",
    "hints of a progressive decrease of the metal content with increasing @xmath30 come from the distributions with  at various @xmath0 : this point , together with the absence of age spread at large @xmath10 , is more in favour of a model in which the bulk of the inner halo formed in a continuous coherent process - collapse of a gaseous mass , as advocated by eggen et al .",
    "( 1962 ) and sandage & fouts ( 1987 ) - than a model in which accretion and merging are prevailing .",
    "undoubtly episodes of merging have taken , and are taking , place ( as exemplified by the case of the dwarf ellitpical galaxy in sagittarius , ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) , but their effects have not been enough as to cancel the overall kinematical and chemical structure left over by the collapse and spin - up of the original protogalaxy , at least in the inner halo region .",

    "the theoretical relation is also shown in fig . a1 .",
    "we see that changes in metal content are mirrored by shifts in the main sequence average colours , in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "we conclude that , with some caution , it is possible to follow changes in populations ( with differing metal contents ) through changes in cm diagram main sequence loci .",
    "another check on the behaviour with metallicity of hipparcos objects has been performed considering the subdwarfs in the catalogue studied by gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 , table 1 ) .",
    "these objects have hipparcos parallaxes such that @xmath38 , and abundances derived from analysis of high dispersion spectra .",

    "one of the difficulties is given by the not negligible dependence on the adopted transformation of the location in cm diagrams of theoretical tracks .",
    "in any case , we are interested in relative positions and the following considerations should remain substantially valid also after a shift of the zero point on the observational plane .    within the errors ,",
    "18 out of the 20 more metal poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath13 -1 ) lie on or at the left of the  = @xmath31 isocrone (  = -1.26 ) , therefore in good overall agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "besides , if we consider only the subdwarfs which , within errors , fall on the main sequence of @xmath31 ( 14 objects ) and compute the average of their values , we find -1.28 , that is , almost exactly  = @xmath31 .    at the same time , the four objects lying on the very metal poor tracks ( 1 and 3 @xmath40 ) give an average of  = -1.69 , that is ,  = 3.7 @xmath40 , slightly larger than the comparison tracks . on the other hand",
    ", some intrinsic uncertainty appears still present even in the high quality data from gratton et al .",
    ": for example , of the two most metal poor objects ( @xmath41  and @xmath42 ) , one falls between the 1 and 3 @xmath40 tracks and the other on the @xmath31 track ( all these metal poor tracks are , in any case , very close ) .",
    "similar difficulties are found when considering stars with @xmath43 .",
    "the average of the three objects with @xmath44 @xmath45  gives -0.88 (  = 2.3 @xmath31 ) , while they lie between the tracks of  = 4 @xmath31 and @xmath46 .",
    "as for the 11 most metal rich subdwarfs in fig .",
    "a2 ( @xmath47 @xmath48 , average  = 5 @xmath31 ) , they are found ( within errors ) between the tracks for  = 4 @xmath31 and 0.02 .    some of these discrepancies may be reduced by taking into account @xmath49enhancement ( salaris et al .",
    "1993 ) , which increases  estimates beyond those given by the iron peak elements .",
    "still , the dispersion in colour observed for stars with similar  suggests that the evaluation of metal content suffers from larger errors than currently indicated .    in any case , let us consider more in details two rather well defined groups , the one with @xmath50 @xmath48  and the one with @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "we evaluated the average value of their  at  = 6 mag , by shifting the star position according to @xmath53/@xmath54 .",
    "this quantity was obtained from theoretical sequences in the interval 5.5 @xmath6  @xmath6 6.5 mag , where evolutionary effects are negligible , and turned out to be @xmath55 0.19 .    for the first group we found an average @xmath56 and an average = 0.791 ; for the second one , -1.28 and 0.649 , respectively .",

    "the larger observational separation in metallicity is due to the fact that the more metal rich group has a substantially redder colour than expected from its , while the more metal poor one is only slightly redder than predictions .",
    "again , changes in metal content give rise to changes in main sequence colours in overall agreement with model predictions .",
    "this supports the conclusions reached before , on the basis of the whole metallicity sample , that it is justified to attribute variations in main sequence loci to variations in metal content ."
