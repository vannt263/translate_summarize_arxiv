    "the importance of 7 to cosmology began with the discovery of the spite plateau @xcite . at a time when there was still considerable uncertainty in the baryon density , @xcite derived an upper limit to the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath2 , effectively using the 7/d ratio .",
    "remarkably , the 7 plateau has maintained a very constant value over the last 30 years and over many observations , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "while the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) predictions for 7 abundances have also remained relatively stable @xcite , the baryon density has been determined to unprecedented precision @xcite from analyses of microwave background anisotropies .",
    "this has led to a more precise prediction of the 7 abundance that points to a clear discrepancy @xcite between theory and observation .    at a baryon - to - photon ratio of @xmath3 @xcite , the bbn prediction for 7/h is @xmath4 in @xcite and @xmath5 in @xcite with an estimated error bar of 0.5 , which is considerably higher than almost all observational determinations .",
    "the value found in @xcite was 7/h = @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the recent analysis of @xcite found 7/h = @xmath7 .",
    "li observations have also been performed in some globular clusters .",
    "for example , @xcite found @xmath8 in ngc 6397 , somewhat higher than the result for field stars , whereas @xcite found a value 7/h = @xmath9 in omega centauri that is similar to halo star abundances .",
    "resolution of the 7 problem has involved many different approaches .",
    "these range from questioning the nuclear reaction rates used in bbn calculations @xcite , or considering additional resonance reactions @xcite .",
    "the possibility that depletion plays a role has been discussed at length @xcite .",
    "the temperature scale used in the 7 abundance determination has also been considered @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility that the solution of the 7 problem requires physics beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , the decay of a massive particle during or after bbn could affect the light element abundances and potentially lower the 7 abundance @xcite . another possibility raised recently is that of an axion condensate which cools the photon background leading to lower value of @xmath2 at the time of bbn relative to that determined by wmap @xcite .",
    "more exotic solutions involve the possibility of a variation in the fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "the problem with 7 should be put into context with respect to the other light elements produced in bbn . in particular",
    ", there is relatively good agreement between the bbn predictions for 4 and d / h and their observational determinations .",
    "the helium abundance is the most accurately predicted of the primordial abundances . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the helium mass fraction is @xmath10 ( @xcite ) ; @xcite found a similar value , @xmath11 . on the observational side ,",
    "the determination of the helium abundance in extragalactic hii regions is plagued with difficulties @xcite .",
    "using the markov chain - monte carlo methods described in @xcite and data compiled in @xcite , @xcite found a higher value with considerably larger uncertainties , @xmath12 .",
    "given the uncertainty , this value is consistent with the bbn prediction .",
    "the observationally determined deuterium abundance is also in reasonable agreement with its bbn prediction .",
    "there are nine quasar absorption system observations @xcite with measurable d / h and with a weighted mean abundance of @xmath13 .",
    "this should be compared to the bbn prediction at the wmap value of @xmath2 of @xmath14 from @xcite and @xmath15 from @xcite with an estimated error of 0.15 .",
    "the individual measurements of d / h show considerable scatter ( a sample variance of 0.62 ) and it is likely that systematic errors dominate the uncertainties . while the agreement is certainly reasonable",
    ", we do draw attention to the fact that the predicted abundance is somewhat _ lower _ than the observed mean and this ( slight ) discrepancy will go in the direction of the possible 7 solution discussed below .    as might be expected , when one attempts to resolve the 7 problem by going beyond the standard model , there may be consequences for the other light elements .",
    "indeed , the destruction of 7 is often accompanied by the production of deuterium . in the models we will consider below , we assume a relatively late decay of a massive particle . specifically ( to be described in more detail in the next section ) , we consider the decay of a massive gravitino ( mass 3 - 5 tev ) with a life - time of order 100 - 500 s. the decays eject both hadronic and electromagnetic energy which breaks up a small fraction of 4 leading to an increase in the deuterium abundance and free neutrons which destroy the freshly produced 7 from bbn .",
    "the models considered here were developed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the particular part of the parameter space most efficient for destroying 7 was studied and we make use of those results here .    in what follows , we will briefly review the results of post - bbn processing by a late decaying massive particle .",
    "we will see a tight correlation between the d / h and 7/h abundances . as a result",
    ", a solution to the 7 problem will invariably lead to an excess of d / h .",
    "however , deuterium can be easily destroyed in stars . in section 3 ,",
    "we first attempt to trace the evolution of these abundances in a model of cosmic chemical evolution based on hierarchical clustering @xcite .",
    "as we will see , constraints from the cosmic star formation rate will limit the average amount of destruction of both d and li .",
    "furthermore , we will argue that the observed scatter is probably due to the in situ destruction of d / h . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze the deuterium data and in section 5 we discuss new and interesting observations of hd / h2 and the possibility that only those absorption systems with the highest d / h represent the ( post)-primordial value .",
    "while there are many possible models which lead to the post - bbn processing of the light elements , we will focus here on a set of supersymmetric models in which there is a massive gravitino which decays into the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which is also a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider a constrained version of the minimal supersymmetric model which is described by four parameters : a universal gaugino mass , @xmath16 ; a universal scalar mass , @xmath17 ; a universal trilinear term , @xmath18 ; and the ratio of the two higgs expectation values , @xmath19 . in addition",
    ", we must specify the sign of the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath20 , which take to be positive , and the gravitino mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as we will see , there is very little dependence on the choice of the specific supersymmetric model defined by the parameters @xmath21 , and @xmath19 .",
    "however , resulting abundances of d and li will be quite sensitive to the the gravitino mass and its assumed abundance .",
    "we will focus on a small but varied set of benchmark points @xcite which are defined by @xmath22 = ( 400,90,10 ) - point c ; ( 300,1615,10 ) - point e ; ( 460,310,50 ) - point l ; ( 1840,1400,50 ) - point m ; all with @xmath23 .",
    "the post - bbn processing of a gravitino decay for each of these benchmark points was studied extensively in @xcite and we make use of those results here .    in the models of interest , gravitinos decay to lighter supersymmetric states , ultimately leading to the lightest neutralino in the final state . for the post - bbn processing of the light elements and the destruction of 7 ,",
    "decays with the injection of hadrons are most important",
    ". these occur through gravitino decays to a neutralino + z , or when kinematically allowed to a chargino + w , and gluino + gluon .",
    "three - body decays which include a quark - antiquark pair may also be important .",
    "subsequent decays of the gravitino decay products ( e.g. z decays ) lead to the injection of non - thermal protons and neutrons which may interact with the recently produced light elements .",
    "the dominant primary reaction involving the non - thermal decay products is the photo - erosion and spallation of 4 . since 4",
    "dominates the abundances of the other light elements by many orders of magnitude , even a small amount of destruction ( which leaves little trace on the 4 abundance itself ) may induce significant changes in the abundances of the other light elements .",
    "generally , the spallation of 4 leads to a net increase in the deuterium abundance , as one might expect .",
    "the final abundance of 7 depends sensitively on the lifetime of the decaying particle . for relatively long lifetimes ( @xmath24 s )",
    ", the 7 abundance is increased .",
    "the a=3 products of 4 spallation , tritium and 3 undergo secondary interactions 3(@xmath25)7 and t(@xmath26)7 , both of which increase the final 7 abundance . for shorter lifetimes , there is a two - step process which leads to the net destruction of 7 @xcite .",
    "first , thermalized and non - thermal neutrons interact with 7 through 7(n , p)7 , which is followed by 7(p , @xmath27)4 .",
    "for each of the four benchmark points , @xcite used the observationally determined abundances of 4 , d / h and 7/h to find the value of the gravitino mass and abundance which best fit the data .",
    "indeed , it was found that a significant improvement to standard bbn could be achieved with gravitino masses @xmath28 tev with abundances @xmath29 . with very little dependence on the specific supersymmetric model ,",
    "the resulting d / h and 7/h abundances were approximately 3.2 @xmath30 and 2.4 @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the resulting d / h and 7 abundances for each of the four benchmark models is shown in figure [ fig : dli ] for gravitino masses in the range 2 - 5 tev with abundances @xmath32 gev with cuts : 7/h @xmath33 and d / h @xmath34 . the best fit point in each case , is shown by a ( red ) star .",
    "while there is considerably more scatter in benchmark point m , the lower envelope in each of the models is clearly very similar .",
    "while the best fits in each case offer a significant improvement with respect to the observed abundances based on 4 , d / h , and 7/h for standard bbn is 31.7 . in contrast , the @xmath35 for benchmark points c , e , l , m are 5.5 , 5.5 , 5.4 , 7.0 at their respective best fit points @xcite . ] , from figure [ fig : dli ] , one can see that the 7 abundance can be lowered further at the expense of slightly higher d / h . however , the d / h abundance is already relatively high at the best fit points with respect to the weighted mean of d / h as determined from observations of quasar absorption systems as described in the previous section .",
    "we next examine the role of cosmic chemical evolution on these abundances and take a critical look as to whether the weighted mean is an appropriate measure of the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "to follow the cosmic chemical evolution of the light elements along with a metallicity tracer , we use an analytical model developed first by @xcite , reproducing the cosmic star formation rate in a cosmological context of structure formation .",
    "the model is based on the standard press - schechter ( ps ) formalism @xcite to account for non linear structures .",
    "the rate at which structures accrete mass is determined by a press - schechter distribution function , @xmath36 .",
    "the model tracks baryons 1 ) within stars or their remnants within collapsed structures , 2 ) in gas within collapsed structures ( the interstellar medium , ism ) , or 3 ) outside of structures ( the intergalactic medium , igm ) .",
    "the model includes mass ( baryon ) exchange between the igm and ism , and between the ism and the stellar component .",
    "the age @xmath37 of the universe is related to the redshift by @xmath38 assuming the cosmological parameters of the so - called `` concordance model '' , with a density of matter @xmath39 and a density of `` dark energy '' @xmath40 and taking @xmath41 for the hubble constant ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this allows us to trace all of the quantities we describe as a function of redshift . the input stellar data ( lifetimes , mass and type of remnant , metal yields , and uv flux ) are taken to be dependent on both the mass and the metallicity of the star ( see @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "once these parameters are specified , we can follow many other astrophysical quantities such as the global sfr or the abundances of individual elements ( y , d , li , fe , o ) in the course of the expansion of the universe .",
    "this has been used to investigate specific issues related to early star formation and the reionization epoch @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we will consider a combination of three distinct modes of star formation : a normal mode of pop ii / i , and two additional modes of massive and intermediate mass ( i m ) pop iii stars ( for more detail see @xcite ) .",
    "each mode has a specific imf : between 0.1 m@xmath43 and 100 m@xmath43 for the normal mode of star formation , between 2 m@xmath43 and 8 m@xmath43 for the intermediate mass mode and between 36 m@xmath43 and 100 m@xmath43 for the massive mode ; the slope of the imf is taken to be close to the salpeter value ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "there are several motivations for including the intermediate mass mode .",
    "these stars may correspond to pop iii.2 stars which originate from material polluted by pristine popiii.1 stars @xcite .",
    "however , our mass range precludes any type ii supernovae ( sne ) associated with this mode of star formation .",
    "in addition , there are theoretical arguments that the metal - free imf predicted from opacity - limited fragmentation theory would peak around 4  10 m@xmath45 with steep declines at both larger and smaller masses @xcite",
    ". primordial cmb regulated - star formation may also lead to the production of a population of early intermediate mass stars at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "there is considerable evidence for an early contribution by i m stars from observations .",
    "these stars produce very little in the way of heavy elements ( oxygen and above ) , but produce significant amounts of carbon and/or nitrogen and above all helium .",
    "evidence exists that the number of carbon - enhanced stars increases at low iron abundances @xcite necessitating a pop iii source of carbon , possibly in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of i m stars @xcite indicating possibly an imf peaked at 4 - 10 m@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of s - process elements , particularly pb at very low metallicity also points to agb enrichment very early on @xcite .",
    "isotopic studies of mg also show a need for an early generation of i m stars . while core collapse supernovae produce almost exclusively @xmath46 mg , observations of @xcite show enhancements ( relative to predictions based on standard chemical evolution models ) in both @xmath47 mg .",
    "finally , i m stars may in part be responsible for the somewhat high 4 abundances seen in low metallicity dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "our motivation here for considering an early population of i m stars is clear : they offer the possibility for destroying significant amounts of deuterium without producing heavy elements @xcite .",
    "we fit the sfr history of pop ii / i stars to the data compiled in @xcite ( from @xmath48 to 5 ) , and to the recent measurements at high redshift by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is modeled by the expression suggested by @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the amplitude ( astration rate ) and the redshift of maximum sfr respectively ; and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related to the slopes of the curve at low and high redshifts respectively . the normal mode is fit using : @xmath54 m@xmath45 yr@xmath55 mpc@xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the sfr of this mode peaks at @xmath60 .",
    "these observations place strong constraints on the pop ii / i sfr .",
    "as noted above , in addition to the normal mode , we add two modes for pop iii stars .",
    "the i m ( massive ) sfr parameters are : @xmath61 m@xmath45 yr@xmath55 mpc@xmath56 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "parameters are chosen to maximize the potential for d / h astration ( without the production of heavy elements ) while remaining concordant with the observed sfr at high redshift . for a detailed description of the model see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a recent study shows that the first stars have feedback - limited masses of around 40 m@xmath45 @xcite , appropriate for core - collapse supernovae .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrevolution ] , we show the adopted sfr for each of the three modes considered . as one can see , the normal mode and the intermediate mass sfr are constrained to fit the observations plotted in the figure .",
    "as the data extend only up to @xmath65 , there is little constraint for @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , data at these redshifts are highly uncertain due to unknown systematics involving , among other effects , dust correction and adopted rest - frame uv luminosity function @xcite . in this context , the massive mode which can dominate at @xmath67 is constrained to fit the optical depth deduced from wmap observations ( shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : sfrevolution ] ) .the global sfr used in this study is the sum of these three modes .      in the cosmological context described above , it is possible to track the evolution of both light elements , d and 7 . following the analysis of section  2 corresponding to the post - bbn processing of the light elements , we consider the resulting d and 7 abundances due to the late decays of a massive gravitino ( see figure 1 ) . as noted earlier , a general consequence of lowering 7 is higher d / h . so to fit the spite plateau we choose three representative values for the 7 abundance corresponding to the values quoted in the introduction : 7/h = @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "these abundances correspond to d / h = @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 respectively .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dlievolution ] we show the cosmic evolution of lithium as a function of metallicity and the corresponding d / h evolution as a function of redshift in the three selected cases . at the metallicities of interest",
    ", there is very little evolution in the 7 abundance .",
    "the high redshift deuterium data come from observations discussed in the next section .",
    "the local deuterium data ( @xmath74 ) is taken from @xcite in the local bubble and the higher value from @xcite in the warm neutral medium of the galactic halo .",
    "d destruction begins at redshift 3 , corresponding to the peak of the cosmic sfr ( see figure 2 , left ) .",
    "the global evolution of d / h fits the observations reasonably well , given the observational uncertainties ( see next section for a discussion ) .",
    "it is important to note the high dispersion of the observed values at @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath37  =  3@xmath764  gyr ) in the range @xmath77 .",
    "this could be a consequence of different star formation histories in the galaxies associated with the dlas .",
    "note that the individual chemical evolution histories are not probed by our model of cosmic chemical evolution which only yields the average abundances of the elements in structures and in the igm .",
    "however , d is a very fragile isotope ( it is destroyed in stars at @xmath78  =  @xmath79  k ) and its destruction rate is highly dependent on the ratio @xmath80 = gas mass / total mass of the galaxy as shown in @xcite ( see their figure 3 ) ; a low ratio corresponding to a low d abundance . as a consequence ,",
    "d / h destruction factors can range between 2 to 10 .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that d can be efficiently destroyed without overproducing metals in a standard chemical evolutionary model with an early population of intermediate mass stars ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to think that these pristine structures are in different evolution stages and consequently have different gas masses and processing histories . finally , as d",
    "can only be destroyed in the course of chemical evolution @xcite , it is reasonable to relate the highest d / h observation to the primordial post - bbn abundance . in this context , we are able to reconcile the bbn d abundance and high d / h observational values at high redshift together with theoretical and observational li abundances .",
    "most of the measurements available in the literature have been gathered by @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "it was concluded , however , that the measurements by @xcite and @xcite are not relevant because not all of the d  i components in those observations are resolved .",
    "this effect would imply systematically low d / h if one has included velocity components in h  i that are not detected in d  i because the d  i is hidden by other h  i absorption features @xcite .",
    "@xcite convincingly showed that d  i is detected at @xmath81 toward q  0347@xmath763819 in the transitions ly-8 , 10 and 12 ( see their fig .",
    "they fit the d  i absorption with a profile that is consistent with the n  i and o  i profiles .",
    "although the latter is saturated , the former is well defined in n  i@xmath82@xmath82953.4,964.0 ( see their fig .",
    "the high d  i / h  i value derives from the presence of a narrow component with doppler parameter as small as @xmath833  km  s@xmath55 .",
    "the presence of this narrow component is well demonstrated however by the detection of h@xmath84 in a single component .",
    "thirty one h@xmath84 transitions are used to derive the doppler parameter from the curve of growth ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "in addition the h@xmath84 excitation diagram indicates a temperature of @xmath83825  k which is consistent , within errors , with the low value of the doppler parameter .",
    "the temperature found here is also consistent with the findings that the molecular fraction is small in most dlas because the gas is warm @xcite .",
    "although errors may have been underestimated ( see appendix of @xcite , there is no objective reason to reject this measurement , d / h  = ( 3.75@xmath850.25)@xmath8510@xmath86 for log  @xmath87(h  i )  =  20.56@xmath880.05 and zn / h  =  0.98@xmath880.09 @xcite .",
    "thus , we have included this value in our study .",
    "note that @xcite report a lower value in this system : d / h  =  2.24@xmath880.67@xmath8510@xmath86 , but their @xmath52 values are certainly too large and their value should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "@xcite reported d / h  =  1.6@xmath89@xmath8510@xmath86 towards pks  1937@xmath761009 in a lyman limit system ( lls ) with log  @xmath87(h  i )  =  18.25@xmath880.02 and for a metallicity of [ si / h ]  =  @xmath90 at @xmath91 . in that case only lyman-@xmath27 and lyman-@xmath92 lines are used and indeed , a model with lower h  i and higher d  i column densities can be accommodated ( see @xcite ) . as a result , we have not included this reported measurement in our analysis .",
    "in addition , it is surprising that @xcite do not consider the measurement by @xcite when they retain the measurement at @xmath93 towards q  2206@xmath76199 which is obtained from a low snr intermediate resolution ( @xmath94 ) stis - hst spectrum ( see discussion in the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath52 value and the decomposition of the profile are uncertain in this observation and the d / h ratio has been claimed to be possibly as high as 2.9@xmath8510@xmath86 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while we retain this object in our average , we comment as well on the effect of excluding it .    very recently , @xcite measure log  ( d / h )  =  @xmath764.69@xmath880.13 in a lls ( log  @xmath87(h  i )  =  17.95 ) at @xmath95 towards sdss j113418.96 + 574204.6 .",
    "they argue that the gas is pristine with metallicity @xmath9610@xmath97 solar . however , at such a low neutral hydrogen column density , the gas is most probably partially ionized and a correction for ionization effects has to be applied . to reach their conclusion ,",
    "they assume a value for the ionization parameter ( log  @xmath98  @xmath99  @xmath100 ) and argue that a gas density larger than @xmath101  @xmath99  10@xmath102  cm@xmath56 is unusual in llss .",
    "we believe that this assumption is unjustified and a density of @xmath101  @xmath83  10@xmath55  cm@xmath56 is perfectly acceptable ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore a robust upper limit on the metallicity is not less than 10@xmath56 solar .",
    "this abundance is typical of what is found for damped lyman @xmath27 systems ( dlas ) with the smallest observed metallicities @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gas may not be pristine and the low value of the d / h ratio could be a consequence of deuterium destruction by star formation activity .    consequently , we have included all deuterium measurements from @xcite plus the measurements by @xcite and the recent report in @xcite .",
    "the weighted mean of these nine measurements is d / h = @xmath104 , where a scale factor of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) is applied to the the error in the mean to partially account for the large dispersion .",
    "the sample variance of would imply a much larger uncertainty of 0.62 @xmath30 .",
    "we note that this value is in modest _ disagreement _ with the sbbn value of @xmath14 from @xcite or @xmath107 from @xcite . excluding the data from @xcite , we find d / h = @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) and a sample variance of ( 0.52 @xmath30 ) for eight objects . neglecting instead the data from @xcite , we find d / h = @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) and a sample variance of ( 0.55 @xmath30 ) , also for eight objects .",
    "it has already been noted by several authors that the dispersion in the reported d / h - values is much larger than what is expected from individual errors .",
    "this could be a consequence of the errors having been underestimated .",
    "the presumption of a unique value for d / h , however , is not supported by the observations ( see also @xcite ) . furthermore , if the post - bbn value for d / h were at or near the upper end of the existing data as in figure [ fig : dlievolution ] , the dispersion seen in the data could be explained by the in situ destruction of d / h through chemical evolution .",
    "if this is indeed a local effect , the extent of the dispersion is not surprising .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there are many potential solutions to the sbbn 7 problem .",
    "it is fair to say that all of them require some additional input beyond what we normal term as standard",
    ". this may involve additional turbulent features in diffusive models of stellar evolution @xcite or new resonant reactions @xcite . however , several of the possible solution come with the price of an increased d / h abundance : photon cooling @xcite , variable fundamental constants @xcite and particle decays during or after bbn @xcite all tend to increase d / h while yielding a 7 abundance which matches the low metallicity pop ii abundance determinations . here",
    ", we have used the results of @xcite for the specific correlations between the post - bbn d / h and 7/h abundances as displayed in figure [ fig : dli ] .    since the d / h abundance is expected to decrease monotonically over time ,",
    "a high value of d / h from bbn is not necessarily problematic .",
    "first of all , we emphasize that sbbn predicts a value of d / h which is about 2@xmath80 below the weighted mean of observational determinations .",
    "second , while the post - bbn abundance of d / h may exceed the observational value , we expect some destruction of deuterium due to chemical evolution .",
    "indeed in a model based on hierarchical clustering , we have seen that there is some modest astration of d / h while leaving 7 virtually unperturbed as seen in figure [ fig : dlievolution ] . however , because these models yield average abundances , they can not account for the observed dispersion seen in the data . as noted above",
    ", this may be due to either under - estimated errors or the in situ destruction of d / h .    before concluding , we note that the hd / h2 ratio is an interesting alternative for d / h investigations in dlas . in the diffuse ism , with physical conditions very similar to those of dlas ,",
    "the formation of hd occurs via the reaction : h@xmath84  +  d@xmath112  @xmath113  hd  +  h@xmath112 while its destruction is due to photodissociation . because of the low abundance of deuterium , the transition between atomic deuterium and hd takes place deeper in a cloud than the transition between atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "moreover , while the h@xmath84 column density is usually very well constrained by the presence of numerous transitions , only a few transitions are seen for hd , making these measurements quite uncertain .",
    "therefore , although the ratio should be interpreted with care ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath87(hd)/2@xmath87(h@xmath84 ) in the cloud should give a lower limit on the d / h ratio ( see @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite and to date , only five detections of hd at high redshift have been reported .",
    "interestingly , some high d / h values are observed despite significant metal enrichment : @xmath87(hd)/2@xmath87(h2 ) = 1.5@xmath8510@xmath86 , 3.6@xmath8510@xmath86 , 7.9@xmath8510@xmath86 , 1.6@xmath8510@xmath86 and 0.95@xmath8510@xmath86 at @xmath114 = 2.42 , 2.33 , 2.10 , 2.63 , and 2.69 towards , j  1439 + 1117 @xcite , q  1232 + 082 @xcite , j  2123@xmath760500 , fj  0812 + 32 @xcite and sdssj 123714.60 + 064759.5 @xcite for metallicities relative to solar [ x / h ]  =  + 0.16 , @xmath761.43 , + 0.36 , @xmath760.48 and + 0.34 respectively .",
    "it is apparent that these measurements , although uncertain , are all consistent with the cosmological d / h ratio and , more importantly , a factor of ten above what is measured in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "this finding is somewhat puzzling , in light of the diversity in the other properties of these systems and in particular their high metallicity .",
    "infall of primordial gas can help maintain such high d / h ratios in the course of galactic evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such process may have difficulties alone to explain the observations .",
    "consequently , these @xmath115 observations seem to indicate that d / h values at hight redshift are somewhat high ; indicating again that a high primordial deuterium value is privileged .",
    "in conclusion , we have argued that although many models which are capable of reducing the high bbn abundance of 7 to the level seen in pop ii halo stars come with a price of an increase in the d / h abundance , this may well be a feature and not a bug .",
    "the weighed mean of the d / h abundance data ( modestly ) exceeds the sbbn value , and carries considerable dispersion . if the upper envelope of this data reflects the post - bbn abundance of d / h , then these models which attempt to resolve the 7 problem are preferred .",
    "the dispersion seen ( if real ) must then be explained by the astration of d / h in local processes .",
    "we note in closing that non - standard model explanations of the primordial 7 abundance generically predict 6 in excess of the standard model prediction as well as an increase in the deuterium abundance .",
    "confirmation of 6 in extremely metal - poor halo stars would provide significant support for models in which nuclear processes during or subsequent to bbn resolve the 7 problem .",
