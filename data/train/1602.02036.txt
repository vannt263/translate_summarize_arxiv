    "the noise in quantum communication is modelled by a quantum channel , which is a completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) map on the set of states ( density operators ) of a system devoted to carry information . note that this view contains classical channels as a special case ( cf .",
    "every quantum channel can be viewed as a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an environment , where the latter is customarily considered not under control .",
    "therefore , the initial environment state together with the unitary defines the channel when the final environment is traced out . in this standard picture , the initial environment state is simply fixed , and the environment output is completely lost .",
    "however , the possibility of an _ active helper _ , one that reads information from the channel environment and communicates it to the channel receiver , is an interesting one that has been considered before with some success  @xcite . in the present paper , instead , we shall be concerned with a benevolent party ( a helper , hence called helen ) setting the initial environment state in order to assist sender and receiver of the channel to communicate .",
    "we considered transmission of quantum information in this model in our earlier work  @xcite . here",
    "we look at classical communication : as in  @xcite , we have a model of _ passive environment assistance _ , where helen simply sets an initial state of the environment as part of the code , once and for all ; likewise , we motivated to consider _ passive environment assistance with entanglement _ between helen and the receiver bob of the channel output .",
    "because classical information , unlike quantum information , can be freely shared , here we can then contrast these passive models with one where helen s state can also depend on the message to be sent ; we call it _ conferencing encoders _ , allowing local operations and classical communication ( locc ) between the sender alice and helen .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section ii introduces the notation and provides the details of the proposed models .",
    "section iii contains the coding theorems of passive environment assisted capacities .",
    "there , after making general observations , we also provide examples of super - additivity of capacities .",
    "then , in section iv we go on to study the entanglement environment assisted capacities . in the following section v we make general observations about the conferencing encoders model , and go on to show that for a unitary operator the classical capacity with conferencing encoders is non - zero .",

    "like the previous environment assisted models , they admit a regularized formulae and are continuous . for a given unitary we can always transmit non - zero amount of classical information using a conferencing helper model",
    ". it would be interesting to find unitaries ( if they exist ) such that @xmath459 and @xmath460 are small but @xmath454 is large . at least in the case of unitaries where all the parties have equal dimensions , we can rule out such a possibility .",
    "this is due to the fact that a small @xmath459 implies a large @xmath460 due to an uncertainty type relation , thus making @xmath454 large .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the classical capacity for conferencing encoders for two - qubit unitaries , which turns out to be 1 bit .",
    "the computation of unrestricted helper capacities @xmath461 is a major open problem .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that if helen exploits entanglement across channel uses we get memory effects on communication , hence the present study can shed further light on the subject of memory quantum channels  @xcite .",

    "a general two - qubit unitary interaction can be described by @xmath462 real parameters . for the analysis of classical capacities under consideration",

    "the local unitaries on @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 do not affect the environment - assisted classical capacity , as they could be incorporated into the encoding and decoding maps , respectively , or can be reflected in a different choice of environment state .",
    "any two - qubit unitary interaction @xmath464 is equivalent , up to local unitaries before and after the @xmath464 , to one of the form @xmath465 where @xmath466 , @xmath467 and @xmath468 are the pauli operators and @xmath469 .",

    "as we are interested in evaluating the capacities of unitaries , we use , @xmath479 where @xmath480 is the complex conjugate of @xmath196 .",
    "note that the latter has the same environment - assisted classical capacities ; indeed , any code for @xmath196 is transformed into one for @xmath480 by taking complex conjugates .",
    "the reduced parameter space given by @xmath481 describes all two - qubit unitaries up to local basis choice and complex conjugation ( we should note that in general @xmath482 and @xmath483 have different environment assisted capacities and in such cases we should consider @xmath484 , say for example to provide a complete characterization of super - additivity ) .",

    "familiar two - qubit gates can easily be identified within this parameter space : for instance , @xmath475 represents the identity @xmath486 , @xmath476 the cnot , @xmath485 the dcnot ( double controlled - not ) , and @xmath478 the @xmath165 gate , respectively .",
