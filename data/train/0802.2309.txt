    "due to the special characteritics of the @xcite @xmath0 passband system , it represents an invaluable tool in the study of the physical parameters of stars , such as effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , and even age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , it has also been shown that this system   and its _ u _ passband in particular   provides us with a sensitive diagnostic of radiative levitation and gravitational settling phenomena taking place in hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars @xcite . while observations in this system have traditionally been limited to bright and nearby stellar systems , over the past decade and a half , with the advent of modern ccd detectors and increasingly large collector areas , the range of systems within reach of observations in the _ uvby _ passband has been increasing dramatically , thus giving a renewed impetus for astrophysical applications of @xmath0 observations . accordingly",
    ", the main purpose of the present paper is to present the first extensive theoretical calibration of the rr lyrae ( rrl ) period - luminosity - color and period - color - color relationships in the strmgren system , thus enabling the latter s use for distance and reddening determinations throughout the old components of the local group .",
    "hb stars form a prop to estimate parameters in globular clusters ( gc ) and nearby galaxies , including their distance , age , and chemical composition .",
    "rrl variables , in particular , as the cornerstone of the population  ii distance scale , can help us determine the distances to old and sufficiently metal - poor systems , in which this type of variable star is commonly found in large numbers .",
    "rrl stars are radially pulsating variable stars with periods in the range between about 0.2  d and 1.0  d , and they are abundantly present in gcs and the dwarf galaxies in the neighborhood of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "rrl stars have also been positively identified in the m31 field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in some of andromeda s companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in at least four m31 globular clusters @xcite .    while period - luminosity ( pl ) relations in the near - infrared bandpasses have been known and studied for a long time now ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the best of our knowledge no such studies have ever been carried out in the @xcite passband system , perhaps in view of the fact that the latter does not contain any bandpasses in the near infrared , and indeed in the johnson - cousins system there are no good pl relations in the visual , except perhaps in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , given that the @xcite has already proved superior to the wide - band johnson - cousins system in deriving stellar physical parameters , it seemed to us well worth the while to carry out a theoretical investigation of the pl ( and period - color , or pc ) relation in this system .",
    "accordingly , we have carried out , on the basis of evolutionary models and hb simulations , the first analysis of the subject , discovering the presence of tight pl - pseudo - color ( plpsc ) and pc - pseudo - color ( pcpsc ) relations for rrl stars   where the pseudo - color is defined as @xmath7 , and is well known to be quite insensitive to reddening ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we begin by presenting , in  [ sec : models ] , the theoretical framework upon which our study is based . in  [ sec : genesis ] , we explain the origin of the derived plpsc and pcpsc relations in the strmgren system . in  [ sec : calibre ] we provide the first calibration of the rrl plpsc and pcpsc relations . ",
    "[ sec : caveats ] presents some comments and warnings regarding the application of these relations to the analysis of empirical data . a first comparison with the observations is presented in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are provided in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the hb simulations computed in the present paper are similar to those described in @xcite and @xcite , to which the reader is referred for further details and references about the hb synthesis method .",
    "@xcite argue that these models are consistent with a distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud of @xmath8  mag .",
    "note , however , that this value is based on the empirical prescriptions for the lmc by @xcite ; using the independent measurements by @xcite , a distance modulus of @xmath9  mag would derive instead .    as in @xcite , we employed four sets of evolutionary tracks to compute our hb simulations .",
    "these tracks were computed by @xcite for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and by @xcite for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the evolutionary tracks assume a main - sequence helium abundance of @xmath14 by mass and scaled - solar compositions .",
    "helium - enhanced tracks were also computed .",
    "the mass distribution along the hb in our simulations is represented by a normal deviate with a mass dispersion @xmath15 . in the present paper , we have incorporated color transformation and bolometric correction tables for the _ uvby _ system , as provided by @xcite , to carry out the transformations from the theoretical @xmath16 plane to the empirical ones .",
    "those tables include the relevant ranges of effective temperature and surface gravities for hb stars , thus being clearly adequate for rrl work .",
    "we warn the reader that the quoted bolometric corrections , over the full range of interest for rrl work , differ systematically ( @xmath17 ) from those adopted in @xcite , which in turn came from vandenberg ( 1999 , priv .",
    "this is likely due to a different bolometric correction for the sun , as adopted in the vandenberg and in the @xcite studies .",
    "therefore , when compared with the @xcite @xmath5-band magnitudes , the present @xmath4-band magnitudes are , for the same gravity and temperature combination , 0.03  mag brighter .",
    "this also implies distances to the lmc that are correspondingly longer , compared to @xcite ( see  [ sec : stand ] below ) .    to define the blue edge of the instability strip",
    ", we use equation  ( 1 ) in @xcite , but applying a shift by @xmath18  k to the temperature values thus derived .",
    "the width of the instability strip has been taken as @xmath19 ; this provides the temperature of the red edge of the instability strip for each star once its blue edge has been determined .",
    "these choices provide a good agreement with more recent theoretical prescriptions and the observations ( see  6 in * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we include both rrab ( also classified as rr0 ) and rrc ( rr1 ) variables in our synthetic plpsc and pcpsc relations .",
    "the computed periods for those stars are based on equation  ( 4 ) in @xcite . therefore , to compare our model prescriptions with the observations , the observed rrc periods must be `` fundamentalized '' by adding 0.128 to the logarithm of the period .",
    "in figures  [ fig : genmag ] and [ fig : gencol ] , we show results for an hb simulation computed for @xmath14 and a metallicity @xmath20 , and an intermediate hb morphology , as indicated by a value of the lee - zinn parameter @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 represent the numbers of blue , red , and variable   rrl - type   hb stars , respectively ) . in the _ upper row _ of figure  [ fig : genmag ] , from left to right , one finds the resulting color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 $ ] planes , respectively , whereas the middle and bottom rows show the resulting pl and ( simple , log - linear ) plpsc relations . in the upper row of figure",

    "the magnitudes in the _ y _ passband are required to closely match those in the @xmath5 passband of the johnson - cousins system , which is why the cmd in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : genmag ] appears so similar to those routinely derived in the latter system .",
    "such a similarity also allows us to compare our simulations with @xcite , since the latter have shown that the flatness of the hb in their @xmath5-band simulations impacts directly the corresponding pl relation .",
    "indeed , as was the case in @xmath5 , the horizontal nature of the @xmath30 cmd also leads to an essentially flat pl relation in @xmath31 , with much scatter as a consequence of evolutionary effects . in like vein ,",
    "the bluer strmgren passbands show a behavior totally analogous to that described in @xcite for the bluer @xmath32 passbands of the johnson - cousins system : as can be seen from figure  [ fig : genmag ] , the effects of luminosity and temperature variations are nearly _ orthogonal _ in the period - absolute magnitude plane , which leads to large amounts of scatter in the corresponding pl relations .",
    "in this sense , @xcite have pointed out that such scatter is so large in the @xmath33 passbands as to virtually render the corresponding pl relations useless , as opposed to what happens for redder passbands where the effects of temperature and luminosity variations become increasingly parallel in the period - absolute magnitude plane . as a consequence ,",
    "increasingly tight , and therefore useful , pl relations obtain towards the near - infrared . in the strmgren system , on the other hand ,",
    "near - infrared bandpasses are lacking , so that one must resort to a different strategy in order to obtain useful relationships involving the pulsation period and the absolute magnitude in this filter system .    in this sense ,",
    "our simulations reveal that , if a pseudo - color @xmath34 term is added to the pl relations , the scatter essentially disappears ( see the bottom row in fig .",
    "[ fig : genmag ] ) .",
    "this is especially encouraging in view of the fact that the pseudo - color @xmath34 of the strmgren system is barely affected by reddening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus being very close to its uncorrected value , @xmath35 .",
    "quantitatively , one finds @xmath36 . as a consequence , calibrated plpsc relationships in which this pseudo - color index is used",
    "are expected to provide us with very useful tools to derive the distances to rrl - rich stellar systems , and even to individual ( e.g. , field ) rrl stars .    in like vein",
    ", the _ bottom row _ of figure  [ fig : gencol ] reveals that , by adding in a pseudo - color term , one is also able to reduce dramatically the scatter that was present in the original period - color relations ( _ middle row _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : gencol ] ) .",
    "accordingly , our resulting pcpsc relationships are also expected to allow one to determine the reddenings of the systems to which the rrl belong , based only on the observed periods , ( reddening - insensitive ) pseudo - colors , and the _ reddened _ colors of individual rrl stars .",
    "we have computed , for each of the four metallicity values indicated in  [ sec : models ] and a @xmath14 , extensive sequences of hb simulations that produce from very blue to very red hb types .",
    "these simulations do not include such effects as hb bimodality or the impact of second parameters other than age or mass loss on the red giant branch ( but see  [ sec : helium ] below for the effects of an increase in the helium abundance ) .",
    "the whole set of simulations contains a total of 336,576 synthetic rrl stars with metallicities ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and hb morphologies from @xmath39 to + 0.95 . as in @xcite",
    ", we find that , for each individual metallicity , the derived strmgren magnitudes are well described by analytical fits that involve up to cubic terms in ( the log of ) @xmath2 , whereas a linear term in @xmath40 suffices . and @xmath41 , and obtained , as a rule , tighter relations when using the latter .",
    "] rather than providing the forms of these relations for each metallicity separately ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the @xmath42 case ) , we have here attempted to obtain fits in which all metallicities are simultaneously taken into account .",
    "this was accomplished by adopting a simple quadratic dependence on metallicity for each of the coefficients in the original fit . here",
    "we provide fits for strmgren @xmath4 and for the colors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , from which the individual magnitudes in @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 can be straightforwardly computed .",
    "the final relations that we obtained are thus of the form :    @xmath49    where `` mag '' stands for the absolute magnitude in @xmath4 , whereas `` color '' represents any of the colors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . in this expression",

    "it is immediately apparent that our derived relations for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 can be safely applied to rrl stars with a significantly enhanced helium content , the implied errors being significantly smaller than 0.01  mag . in the case of @xmath31",
    ", there is a clear offset in the zero point , as well as an increased dispersion in comparison with figure  [ fig : resy ] .",
    "still , the standard deviation remains a modest @xmath174  mag , and the full dispersion range is of order 0.08  mag only   to be compared with the actual dispersion in @xmath31 magnitudes from the hb simulations in the enhanced-@xmath173 case , which amounts to a full 0.59  mag ( i.e. , @xmath31 values for individual rrl stars range from 0.58  mag at their faintest to @xmath175  mag at their brightest ) .",

    "observers are also strongly warned against using single - epoch photometry to derive @xmath202 values to be used along with our relations : according to the light curves presented by @xcite , ab - type rrl may present amplitudes in @xmath202 that may reach up to 0.6  mag . according to our derived relations , changes in @xmath2 by @xmath203  mag lead to average changes in @xmath31 by @xmath204  mag , in @xmath205 by @xmath206  mag , in @xmath207 by @xmath208  mag , and in @xmath209 by @xmath210  mag .    to close",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given its tremendous potential , it is very unfortunate that there are not more empirical studies based on strmgren filters for rrl stars , the papers by @xcite and @xcite being notable exceptions .",
    "while a detailed comparison with the empirical data is beyond the scope of the present paper , in this section we provide a first application of our relations to observations of field rrl stars ( see also * ? ? ?",

    ", we find an average difference of @xmath217  mag ( in the sense our fit minus mcnamara ) , with standard deviation @xmath218  mag , and a maximum difference of @xmath219  mag ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "clearly , our relations provide a very good match to mcnamara s intrinsic color determinations for rrl stars , at least in @xmath220 , though a systematic overestimate by @xmath221  mag can not be ruled out .",
    "note that @xmath31 values , as derived on the basis of equation  ( [ eq : fits ] ) , do indeed refer to the absolute magnitude _ of the individual star_. @xmath31 values derived on the basis of a simple @xmath222}$ ] relation such as equation  ( [ eq : quad ] ) , on the other hand , simply provide the _ average _ absolute magnitude of rrl stars of metallicity similar to a given star s .",
    "it thus follows that a comparison between these two quantities provides us with a direct estimate of the _ degree of overluminosity _",
    "( due to evolutionary effects ) in @xmath4 ( and thus similarly in @xmath5 ) of individual rrl stars ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this degree of overluminosity is then precisely what the last column of table  [ tab : obs ] provides .",
    "it thus appears that all of the stars that we have studied but one ( sv hya ) are somewhat overluminous compared to the expected mean @xmath31 for their metallicities . in the case of rr lyr itself , we find an overluminosity in the range between @xmath223  mag , depending on the adopted metallicity scale ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , which is only slightly smaller than the similar result ( namely , an overluminosity of @xmath224  mag in @xmath4 ) recently obtained by @xcite on the basis of relations that they derived for @xmath20 models . as pointed out by @xcite , due to the fact that empirical versions of our equations  ( [ eq : lin ] ) and ( [ eq : quad ] ) are normally based on the _ assumption _ that rr lyr is representative of the average for its metallicity , a correction to the zero points of these empirical calibrations by this same amount is required ( as indeed performed by @xcite ) .",
    "this , and again as shown by @xcite on the basis of the latest trigonometric parallax values for rr lyr , leads to a revised true distance modulus for the large magellanic cloud of @xmath225  mag .",
    "we have presented the first calibration of the rrl plpsc and pcpsc relations in the _ uvby _ bandpasses of the strmgren system .",
    "though we have shown that `` pure '' pl and pc relations do not exist in this system due to the scatter brought about by evolutionary effects , we have also demonstrated that the latter can be satisfactorily taken into account by including pseudo - color- ( i.e. , @xmath34- ) dependent terms in the calibration   thus leading to our reported period - luminosidy-_pseudo_-color ( plpsc ) and period - color-_pseudo_-color ( pcpsc ) relations . the latter are provided in the form of analytical fits ( eq .  [ eq : fits ] and table  [ tab : coef ] ) , which we show to be able to provide @xmath31 values that can be trusted at the @xmath226  mag level , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 colors that are good at the mmag level .",
    "we also show that these relations remain good even in the case of helium - enhanced rrl stars , and provide a helium - dependent correction to the zero point of the relation for @xmath31 .",
    "these relations should be of great help in deriving reddenings and distances to even individual field rrl stars .    by applying our derived relations to a sample of four field rrl stars with strmgren parameters from the literature @xcite",
    ", we find evidence that rr lyr , su dra , and ss leo are overluminous in @xmath4 ( and thus @xmath5 ) compared to other stars of similar metallicity , by @xmath227  mag ( depending on the metallicity scale ) , 0.20  mag , and 0.11  mag , respectively ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "sv hya , on the other hand , appears more representative of the average for its peers , to within 0.01  mag .",
    "the fact that we can derive the evolutionary status of even individual field rrl stars using our relations clearly demonstrates the great potential of strmgren photometry in applications of rrl stars to studies of the galactic and extragalactic distance scale .",
