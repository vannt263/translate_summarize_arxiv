    "since the beginning of the century the analysis regarding entanglement properties of ground states of condensed matter systems has been on an equal footing with the ginzburg - landau approach to complex quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "further analyses have revealed the monotonic scaling of the von neumann entanglement entropy in the ground state of spin models  @xcite  the so - called _ area - law _  as well as profound relations to conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite .",
    "the von neumann entropy is the most celebrated member of the renyi entanglement entropies .",
    "for example , the von neumann is so important because of determining the scaling properties of numerical algorithms based on matrix product states  @xcite , but in terms of this research line it is particular useful because it lends itself to a useful tool to determine the continuous or discontinuous nature of a phase transition  @xcite and to estimate quasi - long - range order in low - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "above all there is a growing awareness that the entanglement properties  the whole is greater than the sum of its parts  @xcite  may provide the most fundamental characterization of quantum phases of matter .",
    "this is particularly true for cases concerning the presence of phases even in the absence of local order parameters .",
    "examples of this phenomenon are represented by quantum phase transitions in which the `` ordered phase '' are characterized by a non - vanishing topological component of the ground - state entanglement entropies  @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the entanglement spectrum and the topological component of the rnyi entropies are being actively investigated in relation to bose - hubbard spin liquids  @xcite , frustrated models on nontrivial lattice geometries  @xcite , non - abelian fractional hall systems  @xcite , and low - dimensional gapless models  @xcite .    in spite of recent exemplary findings concerning the analysis of bipartite entanglement , there still remains a number of unexplored avenues .",
    "firstly , there is an undeniable rich structure to multipartite quantum correlations for which very little is understood .",
    "secondly , since inseparability is known to be an np - hard problem  @xcite and is devoid of computable necessary and sufficient criteria , this leaves sufficient - only criteria as the only way to tackle inseparability .",
    "however , note that many examples such as measurement based quantum computation  @xcite or many other algorithms  ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that these properties are nonetheless important . in refs .",
    "@xcite a general framework to construct sufficient - only criteria was introduced ; in particular , certain inequalities that have to be fulfilled in specific types of partially separable states .",
    "if these inequalities are violated they prove partial inseparability , i.e. the presence of entanglement .",
    "this may in turn be used to show the extreme situation of a multipartite state that is not biseparable with respect to any bipartition , commonly referred to as a genuine multipartite entangled state ( detailed definition in the next section ) .",
    "there are only few papers dealing with partial separability of gme in many body system , e.g.  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors presented a novel method to explore genuine multipartite entanglement and partial inseparability in many - body - systems by means of macroscopic observables only , such as energy .",
    "the idea is to compute the mean energy value of a given hamiltonian and to compare the value with the mean energy value minimized over all , e.g. , bipartite states or , generally @xmath3-separable states .",
    "since the mean energy value is bound from below , the difference or gap between the energy value minimized over all k - separable states ( choosing , e.g. , @xmath4 equals gme ) and the ground state energy values serves as a detection tool of partial separability .",
    "this introduced  _ gme gap _ \" and  _ k - entanglement gap _ \" , detects large areas of genuine multipartite entanglement and partial entanglement in typical many body states , however , it requires non - separable ground states . in another recent paper  @xcite the genuine tripartite entanglement of the anisotropic @xmath5 spin model was analyzed by applying proper constructed entanglement witnesses .    in this paper",
    "we shall follow a promising path of possibilities by applying the multipartite criterion introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite directly to a subsystem of an one dimensional chain of spin-@xmath6 particles described by the @xmath0 model in the thermodynamic case and the finite size case . in this respect",
    ", the paper takes the first steps to analyzing the properties of quantum multi - body systems via detection tools for multipartite entanglement .",
    "we demonstrate that this method opens new avenues for successfully addressing properties of a condensed matter system such as quantum phase transitions or scaling properties .",
    "note that few days after we put this paper on the net , two other related papers appeared on the arxiv server .",
    "namely , in ref .  @xcite the authors investigate quantum discord in the @xmath0-model and in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors investigated also genuine multipartite entanglement in the @xmath7-model , however , different to this present paper their tool for detecting multipartite entanglement is based on a superset of the biseparable states .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the principal characteristics are analyzed for both cases , i.e. for a finite size chain and in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have chosen to focus our analysis on the @xmath0 model since it represents a milestone in the field of the quantum entanglement relating to many body systems ( being one of the few models for which it is possible to evaluate analytically the reduced density matrix of the ground states regardless the size of the system  @xcite and it turns out to be , e.g , a realistic model for helium absorption on metallic surfaces  @xcite or can be realized with bosonic atoms loaded in the p - band of an optical lattice in the mott regime  @xcite ) . in sec .",

    "the theory of quantum entanglement describes the coherence properties of composite quantum systems .",
    "indeed , the subtleties of composite quantum systems are such that there is no simple way to relate coherence properties of a single system to a larger composite system .",
    "however , one elementary method to characterize the coherence properties of composite systems is obtained in terms of the @xmath3-partite non - separability , i.e. the minimum number @xmath3 of entangled components necessary to describe an @xmath8-partite system .    * definition : `` k - separability '' * a pure @xmath8-partite quantum state @xmath9 is said to be @xmath3-separable if and only if it can be written as a product of @xmath3 states @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) each one living on a different and non - overlapped hilbert subspace @xmath12 a mixed @xmath8-partite quantum state is said to be @xmath3-separable if and only if it has a decomposition into @xmath3-separable pure states : @xmath13    from the above definition it immediately follows that if a state is @xmath3-separable , it is automatically also @xmath14-separable for all @xmath15 . in particular , an @xmath8-partite state is called fully separable , if it is @xmath8-separable , whereas is called genuinely @xmath8-partite entangled , if and only if it is not biseparable ( @xmath16-separable ) . in this interesting case",
    "all subsystems `` contribute '' to the entanglement .",
    "if neither of these is the case , the state is called partially entangled or partially separable .    while the above intuitive definition has been shown to provide a proper characterization of multipartite systems , it is far from straightforward to determine whether or not a particular state is @xmath3-separable .",
    "this is immediately understood for @xmath3-separable mixed states since they may be @xmath3-separable for various partitions .",
    "for example , a tripartite biseparable state can be given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 describe bipartite states .",
    "consequently , the set of biseparable states are given by the convex hull of the states that are separable for a fixed bipartition . from a physical point of view",
    ", the generation of fully separable or biseparable states does not require the interaction of all parties .",
    "moreover , from the quantum information theoretic and operational perspective genuine multipartite entangled states allow for new applications such as quantum secret sharing ( i.e. by distributing a secret over many different parties the genuine multipartite entanglement assures security against eavesdropping or even unfair parties  @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a criterion that has to be satisfied for every @xmath3-separable state . in the instance that it is violated , it serves as a test for multipartite entanglement .",
    "it is obtained by defining a set of permutation operators @xmath19 .",
    "such operators act on two copies of an @xmath8-partite state , swapping the @xmath20-th subsystems between the two copies , i.e. @xmath21 where the @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate the subsystems of the first and second copy of the state , respectively .",
    "it is evident that if the permuted subsystem is separable from the rest of the state , the state is invariant under such a permutation .",
    "this observation is the key idea to constructing very general separability criteria that are based on the following theorem proven in ref .",
    "@xcite:``_every @xmath3-separable state @xmath24 , regardless its purity , satisfies the following inequality @xmath25 for all fully separable states @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , the sum runs over all possible partitions @xmath28 of the considered system into @xmath3 subsystems , the permutation operators @xmath29 are the operators permuting the two copies of all subsystems contained in the @xmath20-th subset of the partition @xmath28 and is the total permutation operator , permuting the two copies .",

    "importantly , this undertaking allows us to prove the existence if a set of genuine multipartite entangled states that do not posses the symmetries given by the vanishing commutators , @xmath31=0 $ ] . obviously",
    ", non - violation of the criterion @xmath32 does not imply that the state of interest is not genuine multipartite entangled since the criterion @xmath32 is only necessary but not sufficient for biseparability  @xcite .",
    "let us remark that the obtained optimized value of @xmath32 are also lower bounds on multipartite measures as shown in several refs .",
    "in particular , these multipartite measures are based on the well - known concurrence  @xcite applied to @xmath33 subspaces .    in the following",
    "we show that for most cases of the @xmath0 model the criterion @xmath34 is helpful and for the few cases where the criterion fails we discuss different strategies .",
    "having defined our machinery for the analysis of the multipartite entanglement we will proceed to introduce the well known xy model .",
    "we consider a one dimensional chain of spin-@xmath6 particles , each localized at side @xmath20 and interacting with its nearest neighbor via an interaction in @xmath35- and @xmath36-direction .",
    "additionally , an external magnetic field in @xmath37-direction can be activated .",
    "we will pay particular attention to the class of translationally invariant states with periodic boundary condition .",
    "this one - dimensional ferromagnetic @xmath0 spin model can be described by the following hamiltonian @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 stands for the spin-@xmath41 pauli operator on site @xmath20 , @xmath2 is the strength of the external transverse field , and @xmath1 is the anisotropy of the nearest neighbor interaction in @xmath35- and @xmath36-direction , taking values in the interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the extremes correspond , respectively , to energy - gapless isotropic @xmath0 model ( @xmath43 ) and the ising model ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the entanglement properties do not change when passing from the ferromagnetic to the anti - ferromagnetic @xmath0 model ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) since only local unitary operators are needed to pass between these two cases .",
    "such models governed by the above defined hamiltonian play a relevant role in the field of quantum statistical mechanics since , firstly , it is one of the few models that can be solved analytically , and , secondly , it is a very good approximation to real condensed matter systems ( e.g. , for neutral atoms loaded on an optical lattice  @xcite ) , and , thirdly , it simulates a quantum circuit  @xcite .",
