    "it is generally agreed that barred disk galaxies experience radial inflows of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. kenney 1996 , and refs . therein ) .",
    "these flows are presumably triggered by gravitational torques from non - axisymmetric background potentials , such as stellar bars and ovals .",
    "( for a more comprehensive discussion of this phenomenon see review by shlosman , begelman & frank 1990 ) . a large fraction , @xmath2 , of disk galaxies",
    "are observed to be barred to various degrees ( e.g. de vaucouleurs 1963 ) , the remaining 1/3 typically consist of edge - on galaxies where bars would be difficult to detect ( e.g. review by martinet 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , most galactic disks are ovally distorted ( bosma 1981 ; kormendy 1982 ; rix & zaritsky 1995 ) , especially in the central regions where triaxial stellar bulges are frequent ( kormendy 1993 ) .",
    "theoretical studies of gaseous inflows confirm that gas can reach the circumnuclear regions of disk galaxies ( e.g. combes and gerin 1985 ; shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ; athanassoula 1992 ; friedli and benz 1993 ; shlosman and noguchi 1993 ) and cause enhanced star formation there , so - called nuclear starbursts ( heller and shlosman 1994 ; knapen etal .",
    "indeed , observations of nuclear starburst galaxies reveal ring - like molecular gas accumulations within the central kpc ( e.g. telesco and decher 1988 ; pogge 1989 ; kenney etal . 1992 ; benedict etal . 1993 ; knapen etal .",
    "1995b ) , where a slowdown of radial inflow is expected in the presence of inner lindblad resonance(s ) ( ilrs ) ( combes & gerin 1985 ; shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ) .",
    "nuclear rings are ovally shaped and their major axes are observed to lead the stellar bars , typically by @xmath3 in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "frequently , they are patchy and incomplete ( buta & crocker 1993 ) . a substantial fraction , @xmath4 , of the molecular galactic ism can accumulate in these rings , which consist of a mixture of neutral and ionized , gas and dust , and is accompanied by massive star formation .",
    "ring masses can be roughly estimated using the axisymmetric rotation curve and/or emission from this gas .",
    "typical masses range from few@xmath5 to few@xmath6 , and even higher ( kenney 1996 and refs . therein ) .",
    "besides being an active site of star formation , a nuclear ring provides a significant gravitational perturbation to the background galactic potential , and is expected to alter the main stellar and gas orbits in the central regions .",
    "growing molecular rings further contribute to the increased mass concentration in the disk . because of",
    "this we expect them to modify the inner galactic rotation curve and the positions and strength of the ilrs .",
    "previous studies of stellar orbits in a rapidly rotating barred potential focused on the secular effects of a growing _ spherically - symmetric _ central mass concentration , e.g. massive black hole and/or galactic bulge , exceeding @xmath7 , or @xmath8 of the overall mass of a galaxy ( martinet & pfenniger 1987 ; hasan & norman 1990 ; hasan , pfenniger & norman 1993 ) . in particular , the main 3d periodic orbits in a barred system with a central mass have been identified and their stability analyzed .",
    "these studies exposed the crucial role of ilrs and higher - order resonances in increasing the stochasticity in the system , or simply heating it up , which results in the weakening and dissolution of the stellar bar and the buildup of the galactic bulge .",
    "this interesting phenomenon has led the authors to argue in favor of galaxy evolution along the hubble sequence ( pfenniger , combes and martinet 1994 ; martinet 1995 ) .",
    "implications for gas dynamics have been studied by pfenniger & norman ( 1990 ) neglecting the self - gravity in the gas .    although it is possible that all nuclear starburst galaxies ( and even all disk galaxies ! ) harbor central black holes ( bhs ) , it is by no means clear that the masses of these bhs are in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "it is plausible that typical bhs in disk galaxies , active and normal , are much less massive , and lie in the mass range of @xmath10 ( with the exception of quasar hosts ) .",
    "for example , emmering , blandford and shlosman ( 1992 ) have argued that bhs in seyfert nuclei may be more efficient in extracting energy and angular momentum from the accreting material than commonly believed , allowing for lower estimates of bh masses there .",
    "on the other hand , a buildup of galactic bulges may proceed on a timescale which is a fraction of a hubble time and cause the same effects on the galactic dynamics within the bar region , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "evidently , the estimated masses of nuclear rings make them competitive with galactic bulges in affecting the structure of disk galaxies . at the same time",
    ", their morphology differs quite dramatically from that of nearly spherically - symmetric or weakly triaxial bulges .",
    "this motivated us to analyze the main periodic orbits in a barred potential perturbed by a growing nuclear ring .",
    "we aim at understanding the gravitational effects of this phenomenon on the stellar orbits , as well as deduce possible implications on the gas evolution in these galaxies .",
    "both circular and oval rings are used , and the results are compared to the previous studies of such orbits , with and without the central mass ( e.g. contopoulos & papayannopoulos 1980 ; athanassoula etal . 1983 ; pfenniger 1984 ; hasan , pfenniger & norman 1993 ) .",
    "we find that in many ways , the dynamical consequences of nuclear rings differ from those of a spherically - symmetric central mass , as addressed so far in the literature .    in the next section",
    "we describe a model for the background galactic potential , which is perturbed by a massive ring .",
    "the potential of an elliptical hoop , representing the ring , is calculated analytically .",
    "the third section presents the method we employ to locate the main families of periodic orbits in the phase space .",
    "readers that wish to avoid the technical details may go directly to the fourth section , where the results of the orbital analysis are given for a series of circular and elliptical ring models , with gradually increasing mass and different orientations with respect to the stellar bar .",
    "a discussion of the possible effects on the gas flow in a galaxy is given in the last section .",
    "the galaxy model consists of the superposition of four components : disk , bulge , bar , and ring . for the disk",
    "we choose a potential introduced by miyamoto and nagai ( 1975 ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "this axisymmetric potential is characterized by the total mass @xmath13 , horizontal scale @xmath14 , and vertical scale @xmath15 . when @xmath16 , @xmath17 reduces to kuzmin s very flattened potential . for the spherically symmetric bulge or spheroidal component we will use a plummer sphere , @xmath18    the bar is represented by a triaxial ferrers ( 1877 ) density distribution of semi - axes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23    and @xmath24 .",
    "we have adopted the strict inequality , rather than use a prolate distribution , because of the desire to represent an intermediate strength bar of moderate eccentricity , as is observed in many of the galaxies which are known to contain nuclear rings of gas .",
    "we use the technique of pfenniger ( 1984 ) to evaluate the corresponding potential .",
    "the ring is represented by the fully 3d softened potential of a uniform density elliptical curve in the disk plane of linear density @xmath25 , as given by , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance between a point on the ring @xmath28 $ ] and the point of evaluation @xmath29 $ ] . with the functions",
    "@xmath30    and @xmath31    the potential can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the semi - major axis , @xmath34 the ellipticity , and @xmath35 a softening parameter which gives the ring an effective thickness .",
    "expanding the integrand in @xmath34 to second order and substituting @xmath36 gives , @xmath37 d\\psi,\\ ] ] where ,    @xmath38    and the coefficients , which depend only on the point of evaluation , are given by    @xmath39    this may now be integrated using standard integral tables to give @xmath40,\\ ] ] with ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the complete elliptic integrals of the 1st and 2nd kinds , respectively .",
    "for @xmath44 the above expression reduces to the the 3d potential of a circular hoop .",
    "substituting @xmath45 this gives @xmath46 and can be compared with the derivation by macmillan ( 1958 ) .",
    "the full expression has been checked against an numerical integration of equation  6 .    for the model parameters we have chosen values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . with adopted units for mass and distance of @xmath58 and @xmath59kpc , respectively , this model has a mass within 10kpc of approximately @xmath60 . the bar of length 5kpc and axial ratios @xmath61 and @xmath62 , represents about 22% of the mass within its radius .",
    "the center of the ring is at a radius ( or a semi - major axis ) of @xmath63pc in the disk plane and is smeared by the softening so that about 60% of its mass is contained in a cylindrical shell of 200pc in radius and height centered at @xmath33 .",
    "this was done to avoid singular forces at the position of the ring .",
    "we will examine models with ring masses of 0.0 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 solar masses , which are added to the mass of the system . because the mass of the ring is insignificant compared to the overall mass , and because the system itself is not dynamically self - consistent , this is the simplest way to account for the gas accumulation in the ring .",
    "these rings represent , respectively , 0 , 6 , 23 , and 38 percent of the mass inside the cylindrical shell ( for circular rings ) .",
    "the bar pattern speed was chosen for the corotation to be at the end of the bar , which gives @xmath67 .",
    "two radial ( and one vertical ) ilrs exist at this value of @xmath68 , as discussed in section 4 .",
    "the first four models ( a  d ) have either none or a circular ring ( @xmath44 ) , the next three ( e  g ) have an elliptical ring ( @xmath69 ) with varying position angles with respect to the x - axis ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the parameters of these models are given in table  1 .",
    "cccc model & @xmath71 & @xmath34 & @xmath70 + a & 0.0 & 0.0 &  + b & @xmath64 & 0.0 &  + c & @xmath65 & 0.0 &  + d & @xmath66 & 0.0 &  + e & @xmath66 & 0.4 & 0 + f & @xmath66 & 0.4 & 60 + g & @xmath66 & 0.4 & 90 +   +    the surface density produced by model  a which has no ring is shown in figure  1 .    because of the small dense central region , the rotation curve of the azimuthally averaged mass distribution rises steeply to about 180km / s at 500pc , followed by a more gentle rise to 240km / s at 6kpc .",
    "we determine the dynamical consequences of the nuclear ring on stars and gas by studying the orbits that are supported by the potential .",
    "the backbone of an orbital analysis are the periodic orbits , i.e. orbits which make a closed figure in a frame of reference that rotates with the bar .",
    "since most orbits in a galactic like potential are not periodic , one may ask what is the importance of these , rather special orbits .",
    "the answer is that the periodic orbits can be used to characterize the overall orbital structure of phase space .",
    "each periodic orbit traps a region of phase space around it , so that nearby orbits within the region trapped will remain nearby .",
    "trapped orbits generally will have a similar shape to its parent periodic orbit .",
    "such orbits are referred to as being regular , while orbits which are not trapped around any periodic orbit , are referred to as being irregular or ergodic , and are free to move throughout the non - regular regions , at least within energy considerations .",
    "it should also be noted that in a rotating frame of reference neither the energy nor the angular momentum are conserved .",
    "there is however an integral of motion , known as the jacobi integral .",
    "this integral of motion , which remains constant along any given orbit , can be thought of as an effective energy .    to locate the periodic orbits we systematically search the phase space @xmath72 , by computing orbits with a given hamiltonian and starting on a particular plane @xmath73 with sign @xmath74 .",
    "the hamiltonian , given in this case by the jacobi energy @xmath75 , is used to eliminate the momentum conjugate to @xmath76 , leaving four degrees of freedom for the initial conditions .",
    "the trajectory is then computed , in the rotating frame of the bar , until it again crosses the plane @xmath73 with the same sign as @xmath74 , giving phase space coordinates @xmath77 .",
    "the periodic orbits given by the fixed points of the map @xmath78 are then computed by an iterative procedure based on the numerically determined jacobian @xmath79 . for this",
    "the least - squares method described by pfenniger and friedli ( 1993 ) is used .",
    "further details on finding periodic orbits may also be found in this reference .",
    "since the jacobian @xmath79 is a linear approximation of the phase space around @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 its eigenvalues provide information on the stability of the periodic orbit . for convinience ,",
    "two stability coefficients based on these eigenvalues are defined , such that the orbit is stable if both are real and less than or equal to two in absolute value ( pfenniger 1984 ) . for planar orbits , the eigenvectors have fixed directions , and the stability coefficients my be identified with the horizontal ( @xmath82 ) and vertical ( @xmath83 ) stability of the orbit .",
    "the orbits are computed using a 13 stage embedded runge - kutta formula of order 8/7 with adaptive step size ( prince & dormand 1981 ) .",
    "the trajectories are computed with a relative accuracy of @xmath84 .",
    "the program uses the parallel virtual machine ( pvm ) software package to distribute the computation over multiple processors .",
    "the parallelization algorithm features dynamical load balancing and is robust against the lose of machines .",
    "both of these features are accomplished by the use of a circular queue implemented by a link list .",
    "each energy to be searched is inserted into the queue .",
    "each slave process searches one energy at a time , requesting an additional energy from the master process as needed . as the master process gives out an energy to a slave",
    "the pointer to the head of the queue is advanced . because of its circular nature this effectively moves the energy to the back of the queue .",
    "as the number of energies in the queue becomes smaller than the number of slaves the same energy may be given out more than once .",
    "an energy is only removed from the queue when a slave has successfully completed the search at that energy and returned to the master any results .",
    "the full search is complete when the queue is empty .",
    "for this study eight dec - alpha workstations were used .",
    "we start by first locating all the low order periodic orbits in the disk plane and determine the sections along the families which are vertically unstable . for each of these vertical instability strips we search for bifurcating vertical orbits . once a vertical orbit has been located , its family is followed by predicting the phase space position of subsequent orbits using a fourth order backward divided differences polynomial with variable step size .",
    "we start by locating the low - order planar periodic families inside corotation when no ring is present .",
    "the search is restricted to simple periodic orbits with initial conditions of @xmath85 .",
    "the characteristic diagram is shown in figure  2 .",
    "this figure shows the jacobi energy , @xmath75 , and the value of the crossing point @xmath86 , perpendicular to the bar , for each periodic orbit located .",
    "the zero velocity curve which delineates the accessible region in the plane is denoted by the symbol zvc .",
    "while each point in this diagram represents a single periodic orbit , a quick glance shows that it is not covered uniformly by points , but that the periodic orbits define curves in this plane .",
    "hence , the orbits are not unrelated , but fall into families , with each family being defined by its characteristic curve .",
    "sections of the characteristics where the orbits are stable are represented with a solid line , while unstable sections are broken .    the main families in this diagram",
    "have been labeled using the notation of contopoulos and papayannopoulos ( 1980 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 family are orbits elongated along the bar and rotate about the center in the same sense as the bar ( direct ) . in the frame of reference of the bar , they also move radially in and out , twice for once around the center ( 2/1 ) .",
    "it is the population of these orbits that predominantly defines the bar , giving it it s shape and structure .",
    "the x - extent ( along the bar ) of the @xmath1 family increases monotonically with increasing energy from the center out to the 3/1 bifurcation , while the y - extent has a local maximum at @xmath87 . due to the moderately weak bar ,",
    "the @xmath1 family orbits have no loops at the ends .",
    "the eccentricity also increases monotonically from the center , but only until @xmath88 where it has reached a maximum value of 0.97 , and the x - extent of the orbits is about 1.1kpc .",
    "further out , the eccentricity of @xmath1 orbits stays almost constant , and then declines sharply just before the corotation radius . at an energy of @xmath89 the @xmath1 sequence turns downward and",
    "changes to 4/1 . in principle",
    ", this section of the characteristic is no longer the @xmath1 orbits as designated by the notation of contopoulos , which continues to higher energies following a large gap .",
    "the 4/1 sequence changes from direct to retrograde at @xmath90 , and then 3-periodic at @xmath91 , before meeting the retrograde family @xmath92 . this sequence is simpler than the one studied by pfenniger ( 1984 ) because of the lack of an elbow feature , but is very similar to that described by athanassoula etal ( 1983 ) .",
    "the family @xmath0 are direct orbits elongated perpendicular to the bar and their presence is indicative of a ilr(s ) in the nonlinear regime ( van albada & sanders 1982 ) .",
    "the characteristic covers a range in energy from @xmath93 along which the y - extent of the orbits increases monotonically from 0.59 to 0.88kpc , while the x - extent goes from 0.33kpc to a local maximum of 0.46kpc at @xmath94 .",
    "these four points may be used to define the position of a double radial ilr along each axis .",
    "as usually , the @xmath0 orbits are more rounded than the @xmath1 orbits , with the eccentricity increasing towards higher energies .",
    "the @xmath95 family are also direct orbits elongated perpendicular to the bar , but are everywhere horizontally unstable .",
    "the @xmath92 family are also 2/1 orbits , but travel in a retrograde sense to the bar and are slightly elongated perpendicular to the bar . for consistency with a bar ,",
    "this family can only be sparsely populated , as disks with a significant fraction of retrograde orbits are stable to the formation of bars .",
    "likewise , the population of this family during the later stages of evolution can play a role in the dissolution of a bar .    while the @xmath0 , @xmath95 , and @xmath92 families are vertically stable along their full characteristics , the @xmath1 family has several sections of vertical instability .",
    "we are primarily interested in the two vertically unstable strips at the lowest energies .",
    "they can be seen more clearly in the top frame of figure  3 where they are labeled @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    in the top left frame of figure  4",
    "are the stability coefficients for this family . recalling that a value of @xmath98 indicates instability , the diagram shows that the two strips are vertically unstable .",
    "both of these strips , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , have two vertical families of orbits bifurcating from them , one in @xmath99 and the other in @xmath100 .",
    "their characteristics are shown in the top frames of figures  5 and 6 .",
    "we classify the 3d orbits using the notation of sellwood and wilkinson ( 1993 ) . in this notation @xmath101",
    "implies @xmath102 radial oscillations in the @xmath103 plane and @xmath104 vertical oscillations in @xmath99 as the orbit closes @xmath105 rotations about the center .",
    "an ` s ' or ` a ' subscript is added to indicate whether the orbit is symmetric or anti - symmetric about the @xmath106 plane .",
    "the vertical bifurcation @xmath107 in @xmath99 leads to a family of @xmath108 orbits ( ban , i.e. banana - shaped orbits ) which are stable from the point of bifurcation at @xmath109 up to @xmath110 , then again between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , after which it remains unstable over the region of interest for this study .",
    "the unstable sections shown in figure  5 are _ complex _ unstable ( see hasan etal 1993 and refs . therein for discussion of this instability ) .",
    "the vertical bifurcation @xmath113 in @xmath99 at @xmath114 leads to a family of @xmath115 orbits which are stable over the entire region of interest .",
    "the vertical bifurcations @xmath116 at @xmath117 and @xmath118 at @xmath119 in @xmath100 lead to @xmath120 ( aban , i.e. anti - banana orbits ) and @xmath121 orbits , respectively , which are unstable everywhere .",
    "this situation , where the @xmath99 and @xmath100 bifurcations lead to symmetric and anti - symmetric pairs of orbits , is expected because of the symmetry of the phase space . however , unlike the @xmath122 orbits which are either symmetrical or anti - symmetrical about both the @xmath123 and @xmath106 planes , the @xmath124 orbits are symmetrical with respect to one plane and anti - symmetrical with respect to the other .",
    "the @xmath124 orbits are shown in projection and in a `` tube '' view in figures  7 and 8 .",
    "the previous section described the basic orbital structure of model  a which contains no nuclear ring .",
    "we will now examine the change in the orbital structure when an increasingly massive circular ring is introduced .",
    "position of the ring on the x - axis was chosen as to be between the original ilrs of the myamoto - nagai model ( 0.33 kpc and 0.46 kpc , from extension of @xmath0 orbits ) .",
    "a circular ring crosses the y - axis interior to the inner ilr .",
    "because the ring is smeared in the radial direction , it actually fills up all the space between the ilrs .    the strongest effect observed with the growth of the ring ( fig .",
    "3 ) is that the extent in energy covered by the @xmath0 and @xmath95 orbits increases as the ring mass increases .",
    "previous studies have shown such behavior when the bar is weakened ( e.g. contopoulos & papayannopoulos 1980 ) . in the present study , where the @xmath1 family of orbits exists also interior to the ring ,",
    "the bar is further weakened by a developing and widening shoulder ( `` bump '' ) around @xmath125 , in the vicinity of the ring .",
    "this `` bump '' is responsible for @xmath1 orbits becoming rounder near the inner ilr .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 orbits in the models a and d can be seen in figure  9 .",
    "the development of the `` bump '' produces a significant local maximum in the y - extent of the @xmath1 orbits , while the x - extent continues to increase monotonically with increasing energy .",
    "this causes the @xmath1 orbits in the presence of a massive ring , e.g. in model  d , between @xmath126 and -4.50 , or equivalently of 0.45 to 1.7kpc x - extent , to intersect with @xmath1 orbits of lower energy .",
    "similarly the local maximum in x - extent along the @xmath0 sequence causes the orbits with @xmath127 to -4.50 , or 0.65 to 0.52kpc x - extent , to intersect with lower energy @xmath0 orbits . due to the @xmath0 orbits being rounder than the @xmath1 orbits , they are less distorted and start to intersect at larger ring masses .    as the ring mass",
    "is increased , the instability strip @xmath96 shrinks while at the same time shifting to lower energies .",
    "in contrast the instability strip @xmath97 grows in size toward lower energies .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  4 where the increasing ring suppresses @xmath96 while enhancing @xmath97 .",
    "for the two higher mass models c and d , vertical instability strips @xmath128 and @xmath129 form , respectively , in the @xmath0 and @xmath95 sequences , which is rather unusual , as the @xmath0 orbits are typically stable .",
    "the only case of instability strips on @xmath0 orbits connected by vertical bifurcations was reported by udry ( 1991 ) for slowly rotating triaxial systems .",
    "there is only remote similarity between the latter and our case , in that the instability appears in highly flattened systems with @xmath130 .",
    "however , contrary to our case , udry s bifurcations connect two instability strips on the same @xmath0 sequence .    from figures  5 and 6",
    ", we see that the vertical bifurcation points @xmath107 , @xmath113 , and @xmath116 on the @xmath1 sequence shift to lower energies as the ring increases , while @xmath118 barely moves .",
    "this is in agreement with the evolution previously noted for the instability strips , since the vertical bifurcations occur at the edges of each strip . of particular significance",
    "are the changes in the characteristic which bifurcates from @xmath107 , where the extent of stable orbits increases significantly .",
    "we also see the creation of a @xmath108 ( ban ) orbital family , forming a loop between the bifurcation points @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively on @xmath95 and @xmath0 , which grows larger with increasing ring mass .",
    "half the loop , up to the maximum in @xmath99 , is stable while the other half is unstable .",
    "a family of @xmath120 ( aban ) orbits also connects @xmath128 and @xmath129 through a bifurcation in @xmath100 at @xmath133 and @xmath134 , but is unstable everywhere , with a section on the high energy side being complex unstable .",
    "these non - planar orbits are elongated perpendicular to the bar and connect the planar @xmath0 and @xmath95 families .      to examine the effect of a non - circular ring",
    ", we have run models with the maximum ring mass ( as in model  d ) , a small eccentricity ( @xmath69 ) , and at varying position angles with respect to the bar .",
    "we find that for rings which are either aligned with ( @xmath135 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath136 ) to the bar , the differences with the circular ring are small .",
    "the planar characteristics of model  d , which has a circular ring , and model  e , with the ring major - axis aligned with the bar , differs only in that the `` bump '' of model  e is slightly smoother . for model  g ,",
    "with the ring major - axis aligned perpendicular to the bar , the break in the @xmath1 characteristic at the high energy side of the `` bump '' is sharper and the @xmath137 loop extends to a slightly lower value of @xmath75 .",
    "a qualitatively different behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath0 orbits is obtained when the ring major - axis is oblique to the bar axes .    unlike stellar orbits ,",
    "gas orbits are subjected to dissipational processes .",
    "this has the effect of broadening the range of orbital frequencies which respond to a resonance .",
    "in contrast to the stellar orbits which may abruptly change orientation by @xmath138 at an ilr , the gas orbits make a slower transition . depending on the details of the potential and pattern speed",
    ", the gas may settle in the ilr region on orbits which are neither aligned nor perpendicular to the bar , but instead at some intermediate angle .",
    "this configuration is the one typically observed for nuclear rings and also appears as a long - lived transient in our numerical simulations ( knapen etal .",
    "we investigate this by making the ring major - axis oblique to the bar axes . in this case , we observe that the major - axes of the @xmath1 orbits become phase shifted , with the position angle of their axes a function of radius .",
    "this is shown in figure  10 , where we have plotted some representative @xmath1 orbits of model  f.    the change in eccentricity and position angle of the @xmath1 orbits as a function of their semi - major axis is shown in figure  11 .",
    "the models are for a @xmath7 ring leading the stellar bar by @xmath139 and with eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.6 .",
    "the eccentricity of the nuclear ring does show a strong effect on the position angle of the @xmath1 orbits , both outside and inside the ring ( fig .",
    "in addition , the eccentricity of the @xmath1 orbits interior to the ring is increased with the eccentricity of the ring itself .    the @xmath69 ring ( model  f ) differs little from the circular ring ( @xmath140 , model  d ) in the trend of orbit eccentricity with semi - major axis except for a small shift .",
    "the eccentricity of model  f reaches a maximum of @xmath141 at @xmath142 or @xmath143 , followed by a minimum of @xmath144 at @xmath145 or @xmath146 .",
    "however , the change in the position angle with @xmath147 is rather dramatic , starting at large radii with a slowly growing phase shift which reaches a maximum of @xmath148 in the leading direction at @xmath149 or @xmath150 , followed by a fast decline to @xmath151 at @xmath152 or @xmath153 , and then continuing to @xmath154 in the trailing direction at @xmath155 or @xmath156 , after which , remarkably , it remains offset in the trailing direction deep into the bulge .",
    "as can been seen from the figure 11 , the minimum in eccentricity is slightly offset from the maximum position angle in radius .",
    "this behavior of @xmath1 orbits can be understood within the framework of forced oscillations .",
    "the new thing here is that the orbit is responding to two external forces , the stellar bar and an oblique ring , which have the same driving frequency but are phase - shifted . a straightforward application of the epicyclic approximation ( see appendix a ) shows that the main periodic orbits respond by twisting the orientation of their major axes with respect to the stellar bar .",
    "even in the case when the ring is more or less circular , but the mass distribution has a quadrupole moment , should the effect remain qualitatively the same .",
    "further technical details are provided in appendix a.",
    "we have performed an orbital analysis in a 3d galactic potential perturbed by a growing nuclear ring . the galaxy consisted of a disk , bulge and a bar .",
    "we have studied the effects of circular and oval rings positioned in the preexisting double radial ilr region of this system .",
    "different orientations of the oval ring with respect to the stellar bar have been tested as well : aligned , perpendicular , and leading by @xmath139 in the direction of galactic rotation . in all cases , both the ring s semi - major axis and the initial outer radial ilr were smaller than the semi - minor axis of the bar by a factor of @xmath157 .",
    "the ring s mass was always negligible compared to the overall mass of the system , but is responsible for a local distortion of the axisymmetric rotation curve .",
    "we find that the major periodic orbits within the corotation radius are profoundly affected by the perturbation of the ring .",
    "for both circular and oval rings we observe a substantial increase in the phase space allowed by the @xmath0 orbits .",
    "if these orbits would be populated , the bar would be weakened .",
    "the biggest change comes from the outer radial ( and vertical ) ilr moving further out to higher energies and increasing its x- and y - extents .",
    "the inner ilr moves inwards only slightly .",
    "hence the growing mass in the ring affects mostly the orbits outside the ring ( this can be seen even more explicitly in the case of the oblique ring of model f ) .",
    "the only effect the ring has on the inner @xmath1 orbits is the appearance of a shoulder ( bump ) interior to the inner ilr in the characteristic diagram ( fig .",
    "this reflects the fact that the @xmath1 orbits in this region become more rounded .",
    "also , the vertical instability strips of the @xmath1 orbits , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are moving closer to the radial ilrs , i.e. to lower energies .",
    "whereas @xmath96 becomes narrower , @xmath97 widens substantially towards lower energies ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 orbits acquire vertical instability strips as well , when the ring becomes massive .",
    "this has some similarity to the slowly rotating triaxial models of udry ( 1991 ) .",
    "weakening of the bar , when increasing the central mass concentration in a galaxy by adding a massive bh and/or bulge , was reported in all relevant studies ( pfenniger and norman 1990 ; hasan and norman 1990 ; hasan , pfenniger & norman 1993 ) .",
    "it was associated with the appearance of a single radial ( and vertical ) ilr due to the altered rotation curve .",
    "this ilr moved out rapidly with the growing central mass @xmath158 , specifically @xmath159 ( e.g. pfenniger 1996 ) . under these circumstances ,",
    "chaotic orbits dominate the space between the center and the ilr , which quickly approaches the semi - minor axis of the bar , causing the dissolution of the stellar bar in a secular process .",
    "in addition , higher order radial and vertical ilrs contribute to this effect by widening the resonance zone .",
    "the growing central mass repells the @xmath1 family of orbits from the central region , i.e. within the ilr , and by doing so it also affects the motion out of the xy - plane .",
    "this happens because of two reasons ( hasan , pfenniger and norman 1993 ) .",
    "first , the vertical bifurcation points which mark the origin of 3d orbits , as described in section 4 , move away from the center as the central mass grows .",
    "second , the stability of the out - of - the - plane orbits is affected , with a region of instability appearing in the innermost family of orbits , which corresponds to our @xmath107 ( 2:2@xmath160:1 ) orbits .",
    "the model presented here differs from the above scenario mainly in two aspects : the preexisting _",
    "double _ radial ( and a single vertical ) ilrs , and the differing symmetry in the perturbing potential , which is far from being spherically - symmetric .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 orbits continue to be limited only to the space between the radial ilrs , whereas the @xmath1 orbits still support the bar between the center and the inner ilr , and between the outer ilr and corotation .",
    "this is true irrespective of the ring s mass , shape or inclination to the bar .",
    "the radius of the outer ilr grows approximately _ linearly _ with the mass in the ring , slower than in the case of the central mass increase .",
    "in addition , an oval ring , oblique to the bar , further degrades the symmetry in the galactic plane , which is otherwise dominated by the @xmath161 mode due to the stellar bar . as a result",
    "the @xmath1 orbits within @xmath162 semimajor axes outside the ring , and at the position of the ring , are significantly distorted .",
    "we note , that such shapes and inclinations of a ring are not merely of a theoretical possibility , but are in fact supported by observations of molecular gas distributions in nuclear starburst galaxies .",
    "the above differences , between the dynamical effects of a central mass and of a ring , create interesting possibilities for bar evolution in response to the growing mass in the ring .",
    "in both cases the stellar bar should weaken as the supporting @xmath1 family of orbits are destroyed or depopulated .",
    "however , the ring has a relatively small effect on the interior orbits , and so we expect that the dissolution of the bar should mainly proceed at and exterior to the ilr resonance region .",
    "we speculate , that the observed difference between stellar bars in early and late - type disk galaxies ( elmegreen and elmegreen 1989 ) may have its origin in the secular dissolution of the @xmath1 family of orbits beyond the ilr(s ) .",
    "another example which is relevant to this discussion and was studied by us in detail using high - resolution nir imaging is m100 ( = ngc  4321 ) , a nuclear starburst galaxy of intermediate type sabbc ( knapen etal .",
    "1995a , b ) .",
    "this galaxy exhibits all the virtues of a double ilr with a nuclear ring .",
    "it possesses a 6 kpc semimajor axis stellar bar , bissected by a weakly oval nir nuclear ring whose inner boundary , at the inferred position of the inner ilr , is clearly delineated by an incomplete ring of star formation .",
    "if nir isophote ellipse fitting provides a reliable measure of the strength of the barred potential , we measure the maximal ellipticity exterior to the ring to be approximately 20% lower than the maximal ellipticity interior to the ring .",
    "it is very interesting , that its nir isophote twist is similar to that of fig .",
    "10 ( see also fig .",
    "two more examples supporting our conjecture that nuclear rings weaken mainly the large - scale bars are ngc  4274 and ngc  4643 ( shaw etal .",
    "1995 ) , whose nuclear barlike features have higher ellipticities than their primary bars .    a crude estimate from our model shows that the linearly growing radius of the outer radial ilr will reach the size of the semi - minor axis of the bar when the mass in the ring is approaching @xmath163 , a value which is comparable to typical masses of galactic bulges .",
    "evidently , the stellar bar can not extend to the corotation in this case .",
    "of course , the above model lacks self - consistency in the sense that the orbit analysis is performed in the static potentials of a galaxy and stellar bar . in reality",
    ", the stellar bar potential would adjust itself to the loss of the main supporting orbits and the dissolution process would be accelerated , lowering the mass required for bar destruction between the ilrs and the corotation .",
    "how relevant is the above analysis for the gas evolution in the barred region ?",
    "periodic orbits do not exactly correspond to the gas orbits in a galactic potential , mainly due to our neglect of pressure forces .",
    "however , by virtue of being the most stable orbits , they can trap gas if the latter is only weakly dissipative .",
    "we find that the @xmath1 periodic orbits of different jacobi energy in our models begin to intersect in the vicinity of a ring when its mass provides a sufficient perturbation to the background potential .",
    "the @xmath0 orbits start to intersect later - on , when the ring becomes even more massive .",
    "this difference in the behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath0 orbits happens because the latter are more rounded than the @xmath1 orbits ( see section 4.1 ) and must be perturbed stronger in order to overlap .",
    "we estimate roughly that this occurs when the mass in the ring approaches @xmath164 of the mass interior to the ring , and so the self - gravity in the gas can not be neglected .",
    "the above estimate agrees favorably with the results of @xmath165-body simulations ( wada and habe 1992 ; heller and shlosman 1994 ; knapen etal .",
    "such intersecting orbits will be quickly depopulated by the gas in a steady state flow which can only move to orbits deeper in the potential well .",
    "an even stronger effect on the gas is expected in the model with an oblique ring ( model f ) . here",
    "the @xmath1 orbits experience a large - angle rotation with respect to the bar due to the double forcing from the bar and the ring .",
    "such rotations would almost certainly lead to the intersection between @xmath1 orbits , which exterior to the ring , have fairly eccentric shapes .",
    "stars populating these orbits would contribute to the twisting of isophotes , such as observed in the nir , in a number of nuclear starburst galaxies ( shaw etal .",
    "1993 ; knapen etal .",
    "if the gas populates these orbits , it will quickly lose angular momentum in shocks and will fall through towards the nonintersecting @xmath0 orbits ( if such exist ) , where it is expected to accumulate .",
    "knapen etal .",
    "( 1995a ) found that subsequent evolution of this gas depends crucially on its self - gravity , which acts roughly as a surface tension .",
    "it causes the gaseous ring to contract by shifting to lower energy @xmath0 orbits and ultimately shrinking across the inner ilr towards the interior non - intersecting @xmath1 orbits .",
    "hence , oblique nuclear rings represent transient phenomena .",
    "their characteristic time scales of @xmath166 yrs and their potentially recurrent nature make them important when studying gas and stellar dynamics of galactic interiors .",
    "stability of accumulating gas in the ring , with its self - gravity increasingly dominating the local dynamics , is an important issue .",
    "simulations of such gaseous rings support the above arguments and are capable of following the gas evolution into the nonlinear regime .",
    "knapen etal .",
    "( 1995a ) observed the accumulation of gas at the inner ilr and the beginning of its subsequent collapse to the center .",
    "this instability is clearly dynamical , but its growth and the final outcome depends on the efficiency of star formation and the fraction of the released stellar energy ( winds and supernovae ) which is radiated away by the ism .",
    "clearly , this phase of evolution in barred galaxies is closely related to their circumnuclear activity and deserves further study .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the gas accumulated in the nuclear rings becomes dynamically unstable by decoupling from the background gravitational potential , leading to a runaway instability and dumping some of this material much closer to the center ( shlosman , frank and begelman 1989 ) .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the main periodic orbits in a barred galaxy perturbed by a massive ring positioned in the inner resonance region , in the vicinity of a double ilr . in some respects ,",
    "the effect of the ring is similar to that of a central spherically - symmetric mass concentration studied earlier in the literature , such as the secular evolution of the stellar bar .",
    "however , a number of profound differences exist . in particular , we find that the orbits affected most are those exterior to the ring , leading to the weakening and ultimate dissolution of the large - scale bar , while the part of the bar interior to the ring and to the ilrs remain stable .",
    "it remains to be seen how the proposed evolution of bar length fits the observed difference in bar properties between early and late - type disk galaxies .",
    "we also find that oblique rings are capable of inducing an azimuthal twist in the main periodic orbits supporting the stellar bar , similar to that observed in the nir in some nuclear starburst galaxies .",
    "overall , gas evolution in the vicinity of nuclear rings is accelerated due an increasing number of intersecting orbits there .",
    "this underlines the crucial role that self - gravity in the gas plays in driving the circumnuclear activity in barred galaxies",
