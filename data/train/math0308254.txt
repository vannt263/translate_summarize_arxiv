    "the _ tropical semiring _",
    "@xmath0 is the set of real numbers with the arithmetic operations of _ tropical addition _ , which is taking the minimum of two numbers , and _",
    "tropical multiplication _ , which is ordinary addition .",
    "thus the two arithmetic operations are defined as follows : @xmath1 the @xmath2-dimensional space @xmath3 is a semimodule over the tropical semiring , with tropical addition @xmath4 and tropical scalar multiplication @xmath5 the semiring @xmath0 and its semimodule @xmath3 obey the usual distributive and associative laws .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a tropical theory of convex polytopes .",
    "convexity in arbitrary idempotent semimodules was introduced by cohen , gaubert and quadrat @xcite and litvinov , maslov and shpiz @xcite .",
    "some of our results ( such as theorem [ polar ] and propositions [ intersectpolyt ] and [ vertexunique ] ) are known in a different guise in idempotent analysis .",
    "our objective is to provide a combinatorial approach to convexity in the tropical semiring which is consistent with the recent developments in tropical algebraic geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the connection to tropical methods in representation theory ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is less clear and deserves further study .",
    "there are many notions of discrete convexity in the computational geometry literature , but none of them seems to be quite like tropical convexity .",
    "for instance , the notion of _ directional convexity _ studied by matouek @xcite has similar features but it is different and much harder to compute with .    a subset @xmath6 of @xmath7 is called _ tropically convex _ if the set @xmath6 contains the point @xmath8 for all @xmath9 and all @xmath10 .",
    "the _ tropical convex hull _ of a given subset @xmath11 is the smallest tropically convex subset of @xmath3 which contains @xmath12 .",
    "we shall see in proposition [ tstc ] that the tropical convex hull of @xmath12 coincides with the set of all tropical linear combinations @xmath13 any tropically convex subset @xmath6 of @xmath3 is closed under tropical scalar multiplication , @xmath14 . in other words , if @xmath15 then @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "we will therefore identify the tropically convex set @xmath6 with its image in the @xmath18-dimensional _ tropical projective space _ @xmath19 basic properties of ( tropically ) convex subsets in @xmath20 will be presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we introduce tropical polytopes and study their combinatorial structure .",
    "a _ tropical polytope _ is the tropical convex hull of a finite subset @xmath12 in @xmath20 .",
    "every tropical polytope is a finite union of convex polytopes in the usual sense : given a set @xmath21 , their convex hull has a natural decomposition as a polyhedral complex , which we call the _ tropical complex _ generated by @xmath12 .",
    "the following main result will be proved in section 4 :    [ main ] the combinatorial types of tropical complexes generated by a set of @xmath22 vertices in @xmath20 are in natural bijection with the regular polyhedral subdivisions of the product of two simplices @xmath23 .",
    "this implies a remarkable duality between tropical @xmath18-polytopes with @xmath22 vertices and tropical @xmath24-polytopes with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "another consequence of theorem  [ main ] is a formula for the @xmath25-vector of a generic tropical complex . in section 5",
    "we discuss applications of tropical convexity to phylogenetic analysis , extending known results on injective hulls of finite metric spaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we begin with two pictures of tropical convex sets in the tropical plane @xmath26 .",
    "a point @xmath27 is represented by drawing the point with coordinates @xmath28 in the plane of the paper .",
    "the triangle on the left hand side in figure  [ tropconv ] is tropically convex , but it is not a tropical polytope because it is not the tropical convex hull of finitely many points .",
    "the thick edges indicate two tropical line segments .",
    "the picture on the right hand side is a _ tropical triangle _ , namely , it is the tropical convex hull of the three points @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the tropical plane @xmath26 .",
    "the thick edges represent the tropical segments connecting any two of these three points .",
    "we next show that tropical convex sets enjoy many of the features of ordinary convex sets .",
    "[ lotsofstuff ] the intersection of two tropically convex sets in @xmath3 or in @xmath20 is tropically convex .",
    "the projection of a tropically convex set onto a coordinate hyperplane is tropically convex .",
    "the ordinary hyperplane @xmath31 is tropically convex , and the projection map from this hyperplane to @xmath32 given by eliminating @xmath33 is an isomorphism of tropical semimodules .",
    "tropically convex sets are contractible spaces .",
    "the cartesian product of two tropically convex sets is tropically convex .",
    "we prove the statements in the order given .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath34 are tropically convex , then for any two points @xmath35 , both @xmath6 and @xmath34 contain the tropical line segment between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and consequently so does @xmath38",
    ". therefore @xmath38 is tropically convex by definition .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a tropically convex set in @xmath3 .",
    "we wish to show that the image of @xmath6 under the coordinate projection @xmath39 is a tropically convex subset of @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath40 then we have the obvious identity @xmath41 this means that @xmath42 is a homomorphism of tropical semimodules .",
    "therefore , if @xmath6 contains the tropical line segment between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then @xmath43 contains the tropical line segment between @xmath44 and @xmath45 and hence is tropically convex .",
    "the same holds for the induced map @xmath46 .",
    "most ordinary hyperplanes in @xmath3 are not tropically convex , but we are claiming that hyperplanes of the special form @xmath47 are tropically convex .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 lie in that hyperplane then @xmath48 .",
    "this last equation implies the following identity for any real numbers @xmath49 : @xmath50 hence the tropical line segment between @xmath36 and @xmath37 also lies in the hyperplane @xmath51 .",
    "consider the map from @xmath51 to @xmath32 given by deleting the @xmath52-th coordinate .",
    "this map is injective : if two points differ in the @xmath33 coordinate they must also differ in the @xmath53 coordinate .",
    "it is clearly surjective because we can recover an @xmath52-th coordinate by setting @xmath54 .",
    "hence this map is an isomorphism of @xmath55-vector spaces and it is also an isomorphism of @xmath0-semimodules .",
    "let @xmath6 be a tropically convex set in @xmath3 or @xmath20 .",
    "consider the family of hyperplanes @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "we know that the intersection @xmath58 is tropically convex , and isomorphic to its ( convex ) image under the map deleting the first coordinate .",
    "this image is contractible by induction on the dimension @xmath2 of the ambient space .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 is contractible .",
    "the result then follows from the topological result that if @xmath6 is connected , which all tropically convex sets obviously are , and if @xmath58 is contractible for each @xmath59 , then @xmath6 itself is also contractible .",
    "suppose that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are tropically convex .",
    "our last assertion states that @xmath62 is a tropically convex subset of @xmath63 .",
    "take any @xmath64 and @xmath65 in @xmath62 and @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath66 lies in @xmath67 since @xmath6 and @xmath34 are tropically convex .",
    "we next give a more precise description of what tropical line segments look like .",
    "[ slopes ] the tropical line segment between two points @xmath36 and @xmath37 in @xmath20 is the concatenation of at most @xmath68 ordinary line segments .",
    "the slope of each line segment is a zero - one vector .",
    "after relabeling the coordinates of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we may assume @xmath71 the following points lie in the given order on the tropical segment between @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath72 between any two consecutive points , the tropical line segment agrees with the ordinary line segment , which has slope @xmath73 .",
    "hence the tropical line segment between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the concatenation of at most @xmath68 ordinary line segments , one for each strict inequality in ( [ sortthedifferences ] ) .",
    "this description of tropical segments shows an important feature of tropical polytopes : their edges use a limited set of directions .",
    "the following result characterizes the _ tropical convex hull_.    [ tstc ] the smallest tropically convex subset of @xmath20 which contains a given set @xmath12 coincides with the set of all tropical linear combinations ( [ alltropcomb ] ) .",
    "we denote this set by @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the point in ( [ alltropcomb ] ) . if @xmath76 then @xmath36 is clearly in the tropical convex hull of @xmath12 . if @xmath77 then we write @xmath78 .",
    "the parenthesized vector lies the tropical convex hull , by induction on @xmath22 , and hence so does @xmath36 .",
    "for the converse , consider any two tropical linear combinations @xmath79 and @xmath80 . by the distributive law , @xmath81 is also a tropical linear combination of @xmath82 .",
    "hence the set of all tropical linear combinations of @xmath12 is tropically convex , so it contains the tropical convex hull of @xmath12 .",

    "the third tropical polytope lies in @xmath84 and is the union of three squares .",
    "one of the basic results in the usual theory of convex polytopes is carathodory s theorem .",

    "proposition [ hypconv ] implies that if @xmath12 is a subset of @xmath20 which happens to lie in a tropical hyperplane @xmath98 , then its tropical convex hull @xmath116 will lie in @xmath98 as well .",

    "that every point outside a closed convex set can be separated from the convex set by a hyperplane .",

    "the tropical pfaffians of format @xmath491 specify the four point condition ( 5 ) in theorem [ buneman ] , while the tropical sub - pfaffians of format @xmath518 specify the six - point condition which is discussed in @xcite .",

    "tropical convexity provides a convenient language to study numerous extensions of the classical problem of tree reconstruction . as an example , imagine the following scenario , which would correspond to the grassmannian of planes in @xmath20 , denoted @xmath520 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath2 taxa , labeled @xmath521 , and rather than having a distance for any pair @xmath183 , we are now given a proximity measure @xmath522 for any triple @xmath523 .",
    "we can then construct a tropical polytope by taking the tropical convex hull of @xmath524 points as follows : @xmath525 under certain hypotheses , the tropical polytope @xmath142 can be realized as the complex of bounded faces of the polyhedron in @xmath3 defined by the inequalities @xmath526 .",

    "the case of most interest is when @xmath142 is two - dimensional in which case it plays the role of a _ two - dimensional phylogenetic tree_.    the construction of this particular tropical polytope @xmath142 was pioneered by dress and terhalle in the important paper @xcite .",
    "there they discuss _ valuated matroids _ , which are essentially the points on the tropical grassmannian of @xcite , and they call @xmath142 the _ tight span of a valuated matroid_. we share their view that these tropical polytopes constitute a promising tool for phylogenetic analysis .",
