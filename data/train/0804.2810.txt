    "the influence of initial conditions on decaying magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence received considerable interest in the 1980 s , because of its relevance to explain solar - wind data @xcite .",
    "indeed , in magnetohydrodynamics the behavior of decaying turbulent flow depends strongly on the initial conditions , and different initial values and ratios of integral quantities can lead to a wide variety of distinct behaviors .",
    "the first systematic study of the different possible types of decay was performed by ting , matthaeus and montgomery @xcite , who identified four classes of possible decay behavior , corresponding roughly to a magnetically dominated , a hydrodynamically dominated , a magnetically - hydrodynamically equipartitioned and an erratic transition regime .",
    "their study considered the two - dimensional case , which is not only relevant in applications in which an externally imposed field renders the flows quasi two - dimensional , but also from a general physical understanding of mhd turbulence , which behaves quite similar in two and three dimensions , due to the equivalent role of the ideal invariants @xcite .    whereas the influence of the initial conditions on decaying mhd turbulence has been studied and understood to some extend , studies on the effect of boundary conditions have been limited to low resolutions @xcite , imposed by the numerical methods used to account for boundaries .",
    "even though these investigations highlighted interesting physics , higher resolution simulations are needed to obtain a better understanding of wall - bounded mhd , which plays a dominant role in geophysical flows in the core of planets such as the earth and industrial processes involving liquid metals . for the hydrodynamic case it was found that",
    ", boundary conditions have a significant influence on two - dimensional turbulence @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the periodic domain , where generally a long lasting state is found with a functional @xmath0 relationship between the vorticity and the stream function @xcite , corresponding to two counterrotating vortices , in a bounded domain with no - slip wall conditions the final state yields an axisymmetric vorticity distribution , for which a linear relation between vorticity and stream function is observed @xcite .",

    "we address the following questions : what is the influence of confinement by fixed solid boundaries on decaying two - dimensional mhd turbulence ?",
    "do the four regimes found by ting @xcite continue to exist in the presence of boundaries ?",
    "what are the final ( viscously decaying ) states ?",
    "we consider resistive mhd , formulated in usual dimensionless variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are respectively the velocity and the magnetic field . the flow is considered to be two - dimensional , incompressible and we assume the mass density to be constant .",

    "an originality in our approach is the way in which the boundary conditions are imposed : we use volume ( or surface in 2d ) penalization @xcite to include the boundary conditions .",
    "this method has the advantage that arbitrary basis - functions can be used . in our case",
    "a fourier pseudo - spectral code is employed . the advantage with respect to a method based on a decompostion in terms of chandrasekhar - kendall eigenfunctions",
    "@xcite is , that fast fourier transforms can be used , allowing for high resolution computations of low computational cost .",
    "also , its application to three dimensional flows is conceptually straightforward and will be addressed in a future work .",
    "the additional terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ qte_mvt ] ) and ( [ eq_magnetic ] ) correspond to this penalization - method .",

    "we choose @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the tangential component of @xmath21 at the wall ) , corresponding to vanishing velocity and no penetration of magnetic field into the solid domain which is hence considered as a perfect conductor , coated inside with a thin layer of insulant , which guarantees that the current density can not penetrate into the solid @xcite . the mask function @xmath22 is equal to 0 inside @xmath1 ( where the penalization terms thereby dissappear ) and equal to 1 inside @xmath3 .",

    "first , in the case of small initial @xmath52 and @xmath56 , a magnetically dominated regime is obtained .",
    "selective decay is observed in this regime which corresponds to the decay of @xmath38 relative to @xmath39 .",
    "second , in the case of vanishingly small initial magnetic energy , the lorentz force acting in the vorticity equation can not become strong enough , so that the vector potential is advected like a passive scalar .",
    "following biskamp and welter @xcite , the magnetic field may however be amplified even if the initial ratio @xmath57 is very small , given that @xmath9 is sufficiently small .",
    "they found that @xmath58 is necessary such that the magnetic field can be intensified .",
    "this is a regime which essentially corresponds to the navier - stokes limit .",
    "third , in the case of substantial initial cross - helicity , the turbulence tends towards an alfvnic state in which @xmath59 and @xmath21 are aligned or anti - aligned and approximately equipartitioned .",
    "this process is called dynamic alignment and the ratio @xmath60 tends to two .",
    "this is a state free from nonlinear interactions , inhibiting cascade processes ( even though this depletion of nonlinearity is rather slow with increasing cross - helicity @xcite ) .",
    "the fourth and final regime is an erratic regime which might tend to different final states and which could be related to various competing subregions with unequal sign of cross - helicity .",
    "this regime can be found if the flow is initialized with small cross - helicity and comparable kinetic and magnetic energies .",
    "whether these regimes persist in the presence of solid boundaries is one of the main questions we want to answer in the present work . to obtain the desired initial conditions corresponding to the four regimes we proceed as follows :",
    "starting from random initial conditions in fourier space , we renormalize @xmath59 and @xmath21 in physical space by varying the coefficient @xmath61 : @xmath62 this generally yields initial conditions with vanishingly small cross - helicity , and initial conditions for regime i , ii and iv can hereby be created . in the case of regime iii ,",
    "a non - zero cross - helicity needs to be imposed .",
    "we achieve this by creating a random initial condition for @xmath59 and a perpendicular field @xmath63 by rotating @xmath59 by @xmath64 . the magnetic field",
    "is then obtained by a linear combination of the 2 fields : @xmath65 hereby any given cross helicity can be imposed .",

    "the main observation is that the 4 different regimes , discerned by ting @xcite are robust enough to survive within a bounded domain .",
    "we now discuss the results in more detail .    regarding the ratio of kinetic and magnetic energy ( fig .",
    "[ e_sur_a ] , top ) , it is observed that in the absence of initial cross - helicity ( case i , ii and iv ) the magnetic energy finally dominates , unless it is very small initially ( navier stokes limit ) .",
    "however , if the initial cross - helicity is initially large and @xmath68 is of order unity , the flow energy will remain approximately equipartitioned between the velocity and magnetic field .    this picture is confirmed by the time evolution of the ratio @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ e_sur_a ] , center ) . in this representation",
    "it is however emphasized that in the navier - stokes limit ( case ii ) , the character of the magnetic field has changed : in the ideal system ( vanishing viscosity and magnetic diffusivity ) , @xmath54 is a quantity that cascades towards the small wavenumbers . in",
    "a non - ideal system an inverse cascade generally slows down the dissipation rate of the quantity .",
    "however , in the limit of small lorentz force , the equations of the vorticity and vector potential become equivalent to the equations that describe a passive scalar advected by a two - dimensional velocity field .",
    "the passive scalar being a quantity which cascades towards higher wavenumbers , the vector potential gets dissipated faster in this case than in the case where the lorentz force is significant .",
    "this results in a rapid increase of the quantity @xmath66 in case ii .    the ratio @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ e_sur_a ] , bottom ) attains its minimum absolute value @xmath69 for case iii .",
    "this corresponds to dynamic alignment : the velocity field is equal in magnitude and perfectly aligned , or anti - aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "the erratic regime is clearly represented by case iv , in which the cross - helicity approaches a value close to zero .",
    "as we will see in the following , this is caused by different subregions with oppositely valued @xmath52 .    for comparison ,",
    "we show in figure [ energy_per ] @xmath68 in a periodic domain , starting from similar initial conditions as in the bounded case using the same numerical parameters . even though the trend is similar",
    ", we see that a more oscillatory behavior for case i and ii is observed than in the case of the bounded domain .",
    "this oscillatory behavior is related to energy exchange between the magnetic field and the velocity field by means of alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "whereas in a periodic domain these waves can freely propagate , in a bounded domain they might be more rapidly suppressed , explaining the less oscillatory behavior of @xmath67 in a bounded domain .",
    "further research is needed to clarify this .",
    "the quantity @xmath70 gives a measure for the dynamic alignment , which corresponds to measuring both the equipartitioning of energy and the alignment properties .",
    "if we are exclusively interested in the alignment properties , the relative cross helicity , which corresponds to the cosine of the angle @xmath71 between the velocity and magnetic field vector , @xmath72 should be considered .     at @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the regime iv.[pdf_theta ] ]     at @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the regime iv.[pdf_theta ] ]    in figure [ cost ] , @xmath76 is plotted as a function of time .",
    "it can be observed that in case i and iii , the velocity field tends to a nearly aligned state . in case ii and iv ,",
    "this quantity remains close to zero , however for a different reason . in case",
    "ii , the alignment is small , because the vector potential is advected as a nearly passive scalar . in case",
    "iv the local alignment is large but different aligned or anti - aligned regions cancel out the contributions , yielding a net - global alignment close to @xmath77",
    ". this can be observed in the corresponding probability distribution function of @xmath76 at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , shown in figure [ pdf_theta ] .",
    "nevertheless , for long time ( @xmath75 ) we observe an anti - alignment .",
    "the decay of total energy is shown in figure [ eloglin ] . at intermediate times , the energy in case i and ii decays following a powerlaw with exponents varying for the different sets of initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ eloglin ] , top ) .",
    "the exponents of these powerlaws are approximately @xmath78 ( dotted line ) for regime i and @xmath79 ( solid line ) for regime iv .",
    "it is seen that these powerlaws are observed only after an initial period of rapid decay . in the other cases",
    "no clear powerlaw behavior can be identified .",
    "this can be compared to previous studies @xcite in which values around @xmath80 and @xmath81 were found for the decaying periodic case . in case iii , in which dynamic alignment is observed , no clear power - law behavior is observed . in this case",
    "the nonlinear interactions are progressively damped by the alignment process , so that no selfsimilar period is observed in the energy decay . at late times",
    "[ eloglin ] , bottom ) all cases show an exponential viscous decay of the form @xmath82 with @xmath83 in case i and @xmath84 in cases ii , iii and iv , a value related to the largest stokes eigenmode of the circle ( @xmath85 ) , which contains most of the energy , as found in @xcite for the hydrodynamical case .",

    "the vorticity and current density fields are rather similar .",
    "we also observe the coincidence of the maxima of @xmath48 and of @xmath49 which may have some effect on the stabilization of vorticity and current filaments . in case",
    "i an almost perfect axi - symmetrical state is achieved at @xmath88 .",
    "case ii is the only case in which the formation of circular vortices is well pronounced , leading to a roll up of the current sheets .",

    "case iii shows almost identical magnetic and velocity fields , as expected in this case of dynamic alignment , in which @xmath59 and @xmath21 are aligned ( or anti - aligned ) and in which kinetic and magnetic energies are in equipartition .",

    "it was shown by joyce and montgomery @xcite that in hydrodynamic unbounded two - dimensional flows a long lasting final state is reached , depleted from nonlinearity .",
