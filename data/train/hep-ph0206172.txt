    "<S> we present predictions on the total cross sections and on the ratio of the real part to the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude ( @xmath0 parameter ) for present and future @xmath1 and @xmath2 colliders , and on total cross sections for @xmath3 hadrons at cosmic - ray energies and for @xmath4 hadrons up to @xmath5 tev . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are based on an extensive study of possible analytic parametrisations invoking the biggest hadronic dataset available at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties on total cross sections , including the systematic errors due to contradictory data points from fnal , can reach @xmath7 at rhic , @xmath8 at the tevatron , and @xmath9 at the lhc , whereas those on the @xmath0 parameter are respectively @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 .    in recent works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have performed an exhaustive study of the analytic parametrisations of soft data at @xmath6 . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we gathered the largest available set of data at @xmath12 , which includes all measured total cross sections and ratios of the real part to the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude ( @xmath13 parameter ) for the scattering of @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and total cross sections for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several experiments are under way @xcite , or being planned , to measure the hadronic amplitudes at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> some authors @xcite also presented what they feel are reference values for the total @xmath21 and @xmath4 hadrons cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is timely and appropriate to present independently our predictions for the forward observables at rhic , the tevatron - run ii and the lhc as well as for @xmath21 total cross section at cosmic - ray energies and for @xmath22 total cross sections up to 1 tev .    </S>",
    "<S> we can summarize the general form of the parametrisations by quoting the form of total cross sections , from which the @xmath0 parameter is obtained via analyticity . </S>",
    "<S> the ingredients are the contribution @xmath23 of the highest meson trajectories ( @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and the rising @xmath27 term @xmath28 from the pomeron contribution to the total cross section , which can be written for the scattering of @xmath25 on @xmath29 : @xmath30 the first term is parametrised via regge theory , and we allow the lower trajectories to be partially degenerate , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ our experience shows that it is enough to introduce one intercept for the @xmath27 trajectories , and another one for the @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a further lifting of the degeneracy is certainly possible , but does not seem to modify significantly the results @xcite . hence we use @xmath32 with @xmath33 gev@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of these trajectories is represented by rr in the model abbreviations .    </S>",
    "<S> as for the part rising with energy , we consider here two main options : it can rise as a @xmath35 , or as a @xmath36 , with in each case the possibility to add a constant term . </S>",
    "<S> we shall not consider the simple - pole parametrisation @xcite , not only because it is disfavored by our ranking procedure ( see below ) , but also because we want to make predictions at very high energies , where unitarisation must set in @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we shall only refer explicitly to our preferred parametrisation of @xmath28 , which we note as pl2 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a universal scale parameter ( to be determined by the fits ) identical for all collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered several possible constraints on the parameters of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lower]-[pom3 ] ) : degeneracy of the reggeon trajectories ( @xmath39 ) ; universality of rising terms ( @xmath40 independent of the hadrons ) @xcite ; factorization for the residues in the case of the @xmath19 and @xmath18 cross sections ( @xmath41 ) ; quark counting rules @xcite ( predicting the @xmath42 cross section from @xmath1 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) ; and finally the johnson - treiman - freund @xcite relation for the cross section differences .    out of the 256 possible variants </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that 24 met our criteria for applicability ( an overall @xmath45 and a non - negative pomeron contribution at all energies ) if one fitted only to @xmath46 for @xmath47 gev , and 5 did for @xmath48 gev ( see table xi from @xcite ) , whereas 20 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) variants obeyed this criterion when a fit to both @xmath46 and @xmath0 was performed , for @xmath47 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) gev ( see table xiv from @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall neither give here the list of models , nor spell out ranking criteria based on new indicators that quantify certain qualities of the fits , but simply mention that the triple - pole parametrisation rrp@xmath49l2@xmath50 @xcite was determined to be the highest - ranking model leading to the most satisfactory description of the data ( see similar conclusions in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this parameterization has a universal ( u ) @xmath51 term , a non - factorizing ( nf ) constant term and non - degenerate lower trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by giving the predictions of this model , adjusted for ( @xmath52 gev ) , with updated data points from zeus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions include statistical errors calculated from the full error matrix @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath54 with @xmath55 or @xmath0 and @xmath56 the parameters of the model . </S>",

    "<S> parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the curves and band are as in fig .  1 . ]    in these figures and tables , we also give our estimate of the systematic uncertainty coming from the discrepancy between different fnal measurements of @xmath57 : we fit rrp@xmath49l2@xmath50 either to the high data ( cdf ) or to the low ones ( e710/e811 ) , and get two error bands . </S>",
    "<S> the distances from the central value of the combined fit to the upper ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> lower ) border of these bands give us the positive ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> negative ) systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the total errors as the sum of the systematic and of the statistical uncertainties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the total errors on total cross sections are of the order of 1.9@xmath58 at rhic , of the order of @xmath8 at the tevatron and as large as @xmath9 at the lhc and dominated by the systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on the @xmath0 parameter are much larger , reaching 5.4@xmath58 at rhic , 5.2@xmath58 at the tevatron and 5.4@xmath58 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that experimental errors are bigger , hence less constraining , but this also stems from the incompatibility of some low - energy determinations of @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the systematic error is always bigger than the statistical one .    concerning the contradictory data , we are forced to use them in our fits until the discrepancy is resolved by further experiments . in the case of the tevatron data </S>",
    "<S> , one can see that the discrepancy results in a big shift ( of more than @xmath59 ) in the central value of the coefficient @xmath60 of the @xmath36 term , which controls the asymptotic behavior , and hence that asymptotic predictions are appreciably weakened by the present situation . </S>",
    "<S> the opportunities to measure @xmath57 and @xmath0 will be scarce in the future , hence any new measurement at rhic , the tevatron run ii and the lhc should not be missed . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the recent publication of e-811 @xcite does not clear the problem as their value for @xmath0 is fully compatible with our preferred model , whereas their number for @xmath57 ( which is highly correlated with @xmath0 ) has hardly changed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the choice of one fnal result or the others leads to a variation of the overall fit quality , as shown in table [ table1 ] ( last two columns ) @xcite : the variant with cdf data has slightly better overall @xmath61 and better @xmath62 distribution over sub - samples . </S>",
    "<S> we can consider this as an indication that the global picture emerging from fits to all data on forward observables supports the cdf data and disfavors the e710/e811 data at @xmath63 tev ( see also an analogous conclusion based on the other arguments in @xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> although one might be tempted to use only data in an energy range close to the one measured , one must realize that analytic parametrisations are constrained both by lower - energy data , and by their asymptotic regime . because the pomeron mixes ( physically and numerically ) with the @xmath26 trajectory , fits to all data help to disentangle the two contributions .    </S>",
