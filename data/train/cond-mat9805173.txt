    "the nonlinear system constituted by a josephson tunnel junction has served as a rich source of interesting physical phenomena over the past decades @xcite .",
    "especially long junctions , i.e. junctions with at least one dimension large against the josephson penetration depth @xmath0 , have proven to be a suitable tool for the investigation of soliton ( fluxon ) statics and dynamics .",
    "most of the experimental work was carried out on linear josephson junctions in the inline or overlap geometry @xcite .",
    "the samples used for the experiments described in this article were of annular quasi - one - dimensional shape and are characterized in detail in section ii .",
    "one - dimensional long josephson junctions are governed by the perturbed sine - gordon equation @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spatially and time dependent phase difference across the tunnel barrier between the two cooper pair systems of the superconducting electrodes . in the case of annular josephson junctions",
    ", @xmath3 runs azimuthally around the junction .",
    "the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 are normalized to the josephson penetration depth @xmath0 and the inverse of the plasma frequency @xmath5 , respectively . the dissipation parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 account for losses due to quasi - particle currents across and parallel to the tunnel barrier , respectively , whereas @xmath8 represents the normalized bias current .",
    "the function @xmath9 describes inhomogenities of various origins , such as externally applied magnetic fields or local changes of the thickness of the insulating barrier ( e.g. microshorts ) . for annular junctions the dynamics and statics of solitons in the presence of inhomogenities",
    "have already been investigated experimentally and numerically . @xcite . because strictly speaking the term soliton only refers to certain exact solutions of the _ unperturbed _ sine - gordon equation",
    ", we use the word fluxon from this point on . in the annular geometry the boundary conditions for eq.([psgl ] ) are periodic , i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ring circumference in units of @xmath0 and @xmath12 is the net number of fluxons trapped in the junction .",
    "this means that there can only be an integer number of fluxons inside the junction at any given time .",
    "if each of the two superconducting junction electrodes is thicker than the magnetic penetration depth @xmath13 ( which is the case for the samples studied here ) , the total magnetic flux and thus the net fluxon number in the annular junction is conserved .",
    "this conservation and the fact , that fluxons can move inside the junctions without influence of boundaries have motivated the experiments with annular junctions .",
    "even though there have been investigations to determine the behavior of fluxons in externally applied magnetic fields , there have been no experiments so far , to our knowledge , considering the fluxon magnetic field outside the actual junction . in our experiments we found evidence that an interaction of this field with the superconducting wiring takes place and results in a pinning potential when junctions of the `` lyngby geometry '' @xcite are used , as is the case in most of the studies in the literature .",
    "we have also investigated the single - fluxon statics in this potential by means of low temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ) which allows a spatially resolved measurement of the josephson current .",
    "these results are presented in section iii .",
    "moreover , we discovered consequences of this pinning in the dynamics of multifluxon systems to the degree that a consecutive transition of the fluxons into the dynamic state was observed as described in section iv .",
    "the samples that have been used for our measurements are @xmath14 tunnel junctions @xcite with the annular geometry introduced by the lyngby group [ see fig . [ 1 ] ] @xcite .",
    "the current density @xmath15 at 4.2 k of these junctions is 1000 a/@xmath16 , the mean radius is 90 @xmath17 .",
    "the width of the rings is 10 @xmath17 ( sample a ) and 5 @xmath17 ( sample b ) , respectively .",
    "the circumference of the ring , being the junction length , is 565 @xmath17 for both samples , corresponding to about 49 @xmath18 .",
    "this is very long compared to most other experiments conducted with annular junctions .",
    "this fact turns out to be vital for the observation of the phenomena described in this article . at 4.2",
    "k the critical currents of the samples are approximately 45 ma ( sample a ) and 23 ma ( sample b ) .",
    "the zero field step asymptotic voltages were measured to be about 30 @xmath19 at 4.2 k    we performed spatially resolved measurements by means of low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ) @xcite .",
    "ltsem allows the local thermal perturbation of the junction due to the electron beam with the focus at @xmath20 during operation of the sample at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "the spatial extension of this perturbation is given by the thermal healing length and its value determines the spatial resolution , being about 12@xmath17 for the samples studied here .",
    "the beam - induced temperature increment @xmath21 can be tuned by the electron beam power . since the thermal relaxation time for the beam induced local thermal perturbation is about 100ns",
    ", the sample response signal is a time averaged information about the junction dynamics .",
    "the latter evolve on a time scale of about 10ps .    in this article",
    "we present two different imaging techniques for the pinned fluxons .",
    "the first method uses the electron beam induced additional energy loss during the collision of two fluxons . in case of fluxon - antifluxon collisions a significant electron",
    "beam induced voltage signal @xmath22 of the current - biased junction at the collision sites can be observed @xcite .",
    "notice , that we are dealing with the collision of fluxons of the same polarity in contrast to the fluxon - antifluxon collisions considered in ref .",
    "our experimental results show that also in the case of the collision of unipolar fluxons , the local thermal perturbation due to the electron beam causes a significant sample response @xmath23 at the collision sites , as it has been already observed by keil _",
    "et al_. @xcite    the second method is based on the two - dimensional imaging of the spatial distribution of the maximum dc josephson current density @xcite @xmath24 depending on @xmath15 and on the phase difference @xmath25 . in our case , where @xmath15 does not show any significant spatial dependence across the junction @xcite",
    ", @xmath26 is directly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the local thermal perturbation induced by the electron beam at @xmath20 decreases @xmath28 and , neglecting any nonlocal effect , the change @xmath29 is a direct measure of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the junction is biased close to the total critical current @xmath31 and @xmath32 is continuously measured during scanning the e - beam across the sample .",
    "we obtain the electron - beam - induced signal @xmath33 if the area perturbed by the beam is small compared to @xmath18 . in case of a hysteretic current - voltage - characteristic ( @xmath34 ) this imaging technique is described in @xcite , whereas for a nonhysteretic @xmath34 a description of the imaging technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "for all images shown in this article any nonlocal effect of the local perturbation due to the macroscopic quantum properties of a josephson junction can be ruled out @xcite . for a comprehensive review of the imaging of josephson junction dynamics",
    "see ref . @xcite .",
    "the key prerequisite for studying fluxon motion in annular josephson junctions is fluxon trapping . for this purpose",
    "one has to break superconductivity . in addition",
    ", a magnetic field has to be applied during cooling of the sample through @xmath35 .",
    "one or more fluxons can be trapped during this procedure .",
    "there are several methods for fluxon trapping @xcite . since in a scanning electron microscope we investigate the cold samples , a reliable way of introducing fluxons into the junction consists of locally heating the superconducting electrodes to a temperature above @xmath35 by electron beam irradiation .",
    "a magnetic field can be applied during cooling by passing some current through the junction or by means of an external solenoid . in our experiments we found it favorable to apply an external field to achieve controllable trapping of single fluxons .",
    "figure [ 1 ] shows schematically the procedure of introducing a fluxon into the junction . after the scanning unit of the ltsem",
    "is adjusted to deflect the electrons onto one of the electrodes the beam is switched on .",
    "this operation guarantees that the area heated above @xmath35 by the beam does not contain any magnetic flux because it is generated well apart from the edges in the superconducting material .",
    "subsequently , when the electron beam is moved towards the center of the ring , the second electrode is heated as well . in this electrode magnetic flux supplied by the external field can be dragged along .",
    "note that the different starting points depicted in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) lead to different configurations of the external fluxon field . inside the junction",
    "the results of the two procedures are identical .",
    "after fluxon trapping , the number of trapped fluxons can easily be determined experimentally by recording the @xmath34 of the junction through applying a current to the junction . due to the lorentz force between the bias current and the magnetic moment of the fluxon the latter",
    "is accelerated , moves through the junction , and a voltage drop is observed .",
    "the @xmath34 of sample a with one fluxon trapped by the procedure described above is shown in fig . [ 2 ] ( a ) as well as the differential resistance ( @xmath36 ) measured through electronic differentiation with a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the asymptotic voltage of about 30 @xmath19 corresponds to the limiting swihart velocity @xmath37 @xcite , the velocity of light in the junction transmission line .",
    "note that the curvature of the @xmath34 does not comply with perturbation theory , which predicts @xmath38 for all v. we believe that the reason for this is the voltage dependency of the quasiparticle tunneling probability @xcite , which means that the dissipation parameter @xmath6 is voltage dependent as well .",
    "the small critical current of about 1 ma ( roughly 3 @xmath39 of @xmath32 without fluxons trapped ) suggests the existence of a pinning potential .",
    "various authors have reported similar observations @xcite .",
    "et al . _ found a small critical current for the @xmath34 of a junction with a length of 15 @xmath18 when fluxons were trapped . that critical current depended on the junction history @xcite .",
    "the statics of a single fluxon in the pinning potential responsible for the small critical current described above was investigated by ltsem . in fig . [ 3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) ltsem images of a single fluxon trapped by the procedure depicted in fig . [ 1 ] ( a ) are shown ( sample a ) .",
    "they show a single fluxon at two different positions in the ring .",
    "the white areas correspond to a josephson supercurrent into the paper plane , the black areas into the opposite direction .",
    "the magnetic moment and the direction in which the lorentz force acts are symbolized by arrows .",
    "apparently the location of the pinning center depends on the direction of the bias current .",
    "considering that , because of the way the fluxon was trapped , the magnetic field of the fluxon encloses only the upper electrode ( see fig . [ 1 ] ( a)).therefore , we conclude that the fluxon gets pinned through the interaction with the upper electrode .    further evidence for the validity of this argument is given by the ltsem images of fig . [ 4 ] .",
    "the fluxon shown in these images was trapped in the junction using the procedure depicted in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ( b ) ( sample a ) .",
    "hence the magnetic field of the fluxon encloses only the lower electrode and gets caught on that wiring when acted on by the bias current .",
    "the fact , that the position of the pinned fluxons with respect to the horizontal symmetry axis of the junction differs for reverse bias current directions in both figures [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , hints at the existence of additional forces on the fluxon .",
    "the measurements took place in a reasonably well shielded environment .",
    "however it is possible , that some external magnetic field is present at the sample site , which would act as an additional pinning force .",
    "an investigation of single fluxons trapped in the junction by crossing both electrodes _ from the side _ , i.e. switching on the electron beam outside the electrodes and then moving it into the center of the ring by crossing the narrowest part of the combined electrodes , confirms the above interpretation .",
    "this procedure allows the field of the fluxon to circle both electrodes as schematically shown in fig . [ 5 ] . even though shielding currents flow in the electrodes to ensure the unambiguity of the cooper pair function in each electrode ( the magnetic flux contained by a single fluxon is exactly the elementary flux quantum @xmath40 ) , pinning is still expected to occur .",
    "the reason is the fluxon field outside the junction in the shape of a distorted magnetic dipole field having its maximum value just at the outer border of the junction ( see fig .",
    "[ 5 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the distortion is due to the meissner effect in the superconducting electrodes .",
    "inside the junction the fluxon field is localized to an azimuthal length comparable to the josephson penetration depth . in this case interaction of the fluxon magnetic field with",
    "the wiring of both electrodes takes place .",
    "the resulting pinning potential is expected to be shallower than the potential discussed earlier for the procedures in fig . [ 1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "consequently the critical current should be lower .",
    "experiments showed indeed , that trapping of single fluxons over the sides resulted in a value of @xmath32 being 50 @xmath39 smaller than for trapping from the middle of the electrodes .",
    "it is interesting that the transition into the dynamic state does not happen in an abrupt manner .",
    "even if a significant voltage drop is measured across the junction for a single - fluxon mode ( for example a voltage greater than 5 @xmath19 in fig . [ 2 ] ( a ) ) the ltsem images ( not shown here ) still display the josephson current distribution of a fluxon at rest .",
    "we believe that this is a result of the relatively weak pinning forces which allow the fluxon to get depinned only part of the time at first .",
    "as described in section ii the ltsem images are time averaged measurements .",
    "therefore , the images recorded at finite voltages can be interpreted as time averaged images of a sporadically moving fluxon .",
    "the features of @xmath41 do not change qualitatively when more than one fluxon is trapped .",
    "figure [ 2 ] ( b ) shows the @xmath34 and the differential resistance for the case of two fluxons trapped by the procedure shown in fig [ 1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the @xmath36-curve displays two peaks at low voltages corresponding to the consecutive transition of the two fluxons from the static into the dynamic state .",
    "note that @xmath32 of the two fluxon system is only about 60 % of the value for one fluxon .",
    "it appears that this is due to the interfluxon repulsion of the fluxon magnetic moments . @xcite .    in the light of the concentration of the extrajunctional fluxon field in the immediate vicinity of the junction ( see fig . [ 5 ] ( b ) ) it is noteworthy that it was not possible to trap more than seven fluxons in the junction by repeatedly applying the procedures shown in fig [ 1 ] . on the other hand it needed only little effort to trap up to 50 fluxons by introducing them over the sides i.e. allowing the fluxon magnetic field to enclose both electrodes @xcite . as already explained in section iii ( reduced ) pinning",
    "is still expected for this case .",
    "the @xmath34 and the @xmath36-curve for such a multifluxon mode show a rather complicated shape as depicted in fig .",
    "[ 6 ] for the situation of seventeen fluxons trapped in the junction ( sample b ) . due to the presence of a small ohmic resistance in series with the junction in this particular measurement the @xmath34 is tilted and the asymptotic voltage is larger than the 510 @xmath19 expected for a seventeen fluxon system .",
    "nevertheless the structure of the @xmath36-curve can be explained by the consecutive transition of all seventeen fluxons from the static into the dynamic state .",
    "fluxon - fluxon collisions are expected for the situation where more than one fluxon is trapped in the junction , while at least one of them is moving and the others are pinned . a large number of ltsem images were recorded near the resonant structures in fig .",
    "arrows indicate the voltages at which selected images , shown in fig . [ 7 ] , were taken . in the ltsem images we observe the following process .",
    "one after another the fluxons get depinned when the bias current is increased , as indicated by the decreasing number of signal peaks . finally only a single one is still at rest while sixteen are moving as seen in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] ( d ) .",
    "the moving fluxons are used as a detector for the pinned ones by the collisions that take place once during each revolution of every moving fluxon .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to recall that the transition into the dynamic state is not abrupt .",
    "instead a sporadic change between statics and dynamics of a particular fluxon takes place .",
    "therefore it makes sense that the image in fig.[7 ] ( d ) still shows the last fluxon , even though it was recorded at a voltage greater than the one corresponding to the last peak in the differential resistance in fig . [ 6 ] .",
    "this is in accordance with the findings for single trapped fluxons .",
    "it is interesting that the position of the last static fluxon shown in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] ( d ) is identical with the one of a single fluxon getting pinned at the wiring of the upper electrode . for reversed bias current direction the pinning of the last fluxon at the other side of the same wiring was observed .",
    "furthermore we want to point out the way in which the size of the fluxons is different in each of the images of fig .",
    "the fluxon compression ( see eq .",
    "[ eindeutigkeit ] results in a reduced fluxon length , since the fluxons are squeezed into the junction .",
    "the more fluxons change to the dynamic state , the less compression the static ones experience .",
    "therefore the static fluxons expand .",
    "finally the last static fluxon ( fig . [ 7 ] ( d ) ) reaches the relaxed size , i.e.the size we observe if only a single fluxon exists in the junction at rest , being approximately 2@xmath42 .",
    "we have investigated the statics and dynamics of ( josephson ) fluxons in long annular @xmath14 tunnel junctions .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics showed evidence of fluxon pinning .",
    "applying low temperature scanning electron microscopy , we were able to image the statics of single pinned fluxons . by carefully controlling the procedure through which fluxons were introduced into the junction , it was possible to influence the position of the pinned fluxons .",
    "these experiments show that this pinning is a result of the interaction of the magnetic fluxon field with the superconducting wiring of the junction .",
    "we have also investigated the behavior of multifluxon states . for the case of 17 fluxons trapped in the junction we found that the fluxons get depinned one after another with increasing bias current .",
