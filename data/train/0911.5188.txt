    "the existence of dark matter has been established by numerous observations .",
    "although it constitutes most of the matter in the universe  @xcite , the nature of dark matter remains largely unknown .",
    "one widely held possibility is that it is a new fundamental particle produced in the early universe and present today as a thermal relic . among the best motivated of these",
    "are the so - called weakly interacting massive particles , or `` wimps '' ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) which are predicted to be undergoing annihilations  @xcite and possibly decays  @xcite in the current epoch .",
    "recently , the instruments pamela  @xcite , atic  @xcite , ppb - bets  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite have observed features in the cosmic - ray @xmath2 spectrum and a positron fraction that are inconsistent with known backgrounds . while these anomalies may be due to unidentified astrophysical sources  @xcite , one exciting possibility is that they are due to the decay  @xcite or annihilation  @xcite of dark matter particles into standard model states . even in the case that anomalies are not caused by new physics in the dark sector ,",
    "the constraints are generally applicable to dark matter models .    in order for dark matter to explain the anomalies",
    ", the products of decay or annihilation must be primarily leptonic . in either case",
    ", the fermi observation gives the most precise preferred region in mass and lifetime / cross - section ; for decays , only @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states fit the data , while for annihilations a small region of @xmath14 is also permitted  @xcite . for the allowed parameter space ,",
    "decays or annihilations into hadrons and weak and higgs bosons are severely limited .",
    "decays are constrained by the fermi observation of the isotropic diffuse gamma - ray flux  @xcite , and annihilations are constrained by the production of antiprotons  @xcite .",
    "explaining the anomalies with annihilations has an additional challenge . in order to match the observed rates ,",
    "the cross - section required is @xmath15@xmath16 times that expected for thermal production of the dark matter in the early universe .",
    "this necessitates nonthermal production mechanisms or low - velocity enhancements to the cross - section , such as the sommerfeld enhancement  @xcite or the breit - wigner enhancement  @xcite .",
    "moreover , high cross section annihilations to leptonic states are tightly constrained by synchrotron radio emissions from the galactic center , although this constraint can be evaded if the true galactic dark matter halo profile is much less steep at the galactic center than benchmark profiles  @xcite .    for either decays or annihilations , neutrino observations may provide the strongest constraints",
    " or the most promising corroborating signatures  for dark matter to be the source of the anomalies . with the exception of the disfavored @xmath14 channel , the required leptonic final states decay into neutrinos .",
    "these travel undeflected from their sources , eliminating any uncertainties in modeling their propagation .",
    "moreover , astrophysical sources that may explain the anomalies are not expected to produce a large flux of neutrinos .",
    "pulsars , for example , would generate at most @xmath17 events / year at a full km - scale detector , and only at energies greater than 10 tev  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , challenges to constraining dark matter models with neutrinos .",
    "as they are observed only by collecting cherenkov light from induced particle showers or from secondary muons , angular resolution is poor compared to gamma - ray observatories .",
    "also , there are significant backgrounds from atmospheric muon and neutrino fluxes . however ,",
    "if these backgrounds can be controlled , the poor angular resolution need not be a barrier ; indeed by integrating the flux over a large area of the sky , the resulting constraint is much less sensitive to the choice of dark matter profile  @xcite .",
    "moreover , by observing the galactic and extragalactic diffuse dark matter , rather than any that may have been captured by the sun or the earth , any constraints will be independent of the dark matter - nucleon cross sections , which are related to final states in a model - specific way  @xcite .",
    "recent analyses show the power of neutrino constraints , using various strategies to reduce the effect of atmospheric backgrounds .",
    "the super - kamiokande observatory resides in the northern hemisphere , facing away from the galactic center , minimizing atmospheric backgrounds .",
    "measurements of upward - going muons place a limit on the flux of galactic @xmath3 , providing a robust constraint that eliminates annihilations to @xmath1 as a source of the @xmath2 anomalies  @xcite .",
    "the icecube observatory , on the other hand , resides at the south pole where down - going atmospheric fluxes are coincident with the neutrinos from the galactic center .",
    "the overwhelming background of atmospheric muons can be suppressed by event selection to establish an isotropic diffuse flux limit  @xcite , but this limit only starts at a high energy threshold @xmath18 , and yields a relatively weak constraint as we will show .    currently under construction is deepcore  @xcite , an in - fill of the icecube detector which will use the outer instrumented volume as a veto on downward - going muons to a level of one part in @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this will allow the galactic neutrino flux to be measured and compared against the atmospheric neutrino flux , providing a constraint on dark matter decays and annihilations .",
    "recent work  @xcite by some of the authors shows that icecube+deepcore will be able to significantly constrain the parameter space of decays to @xmath0 , and rule out decays to @xmath1 and annihilation to @xmath0 as possible sources of the anomalies in less than five years of running .",
    "recently , icecube+deepcore has demonstrated in simulations the ability to distinguish between track - like events , which are due to the charged - current interactions of @xmath3 , and cascade events , which are induced by @xmath20 through charged - current interactions and by all neutrino flavors through neutral - current interactions  @xcite .",
    "this is very useful for constraining dark matter neutrino fluxes because @xmath3 is the dominant flavor of atmospheric neutrinos above 40  gev  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino - nucleon cross sections are the same for all flavors , so signal would be considerably enhanced , while background would be reduced because @xmath3 only creates cascade events through the neutral - current interaction , which is lower in cross section than the charged - current interaction  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ nuncs ] ) .",
    "moreover , cascade events are easy to distinguish from the tracks caused by any atmospheric muons that are not vetoed by the outer volume .        in this paper",
    "we show that observation of cascade events at icecube+deepcore can enhance the neutrino constraints on dark matter , and rule out ( or corroborate ) dark matter decays to @xmath0 or @xmath1 and annihilation to @xmath0 as sources of the observed @xmath2 cosmic - ray anomalies in a much shorter time compared to searches that rely solely on track - like events .",
    "for brevity , in the expressions below we write only the terms for neutrinos and not the terms for antineutrinos . the terms are identical , except replacing `` @xmath21 '' by `` @xmath22 '' .",
    "the flux of neutrinos from the galactic dark matter halo is given by @xmath23 for decays and by @xmath24 for annihilations , where @xmath25 kpc is the distance from the sun to the galactic center  @xcite , @xmath26 is the dark matter density in the solar neighborhood , @xmath27 is the dark matter mass , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the dark matter lifetime and thermally averaged cross section respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is the line - of - sight ( los ) integral through the halo profile : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the region of sky observed . in this analysis",
    "we use the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo profile  @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 kpc .    the neutrino source spectra @xmath35 for flavors @xmath36 are given by pythia  @xcite simulation . assuming @xmath37 ,",
    "the flavor distribution will be @xmath38 as the neutrinos reach the earth , having traveled a variety of long distances across the galaxy and being well mixed through vacuum oscillations .    as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the only background to cascade events is atmospheric neutrinos after the veto suppresses the background of atmospheric muons to one part in @xmath39 and event selection is used to eliminate the rest .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath40 fluxes are given by ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath3 flux agrees well with amanda observation  @xcite . at low zenith angles , the flux of background",
    "@xmath3 is @xmath41 times greater than the flux of @xmath40 from 40 gev to 100 tev ; it is @xmath42 times greater than the flux of @xmath43 ( see ref .",
    "however , below 40 gev , especially at high zenith angles , the atmospheric fluxes of the three flavors only differ by @xmath17 due to flavor mixing .",
    "since modeling the background ( and signal ) below 40 gev would require simulating flavor mixing as the neutrinos propagate through the limb of the earth , for this analysis we simply set an energy cutoff of @xmath44 gev .    to obtain the event rates due to the galactic and background fluxes , we first set energy bins for dark matter of mass @xmath27 to be @xmath45 $ ] for decays and @xmath46 $ ] for annihilations .",
    "note that the bin width is much greater than the energy resolution , @xmath47 for track - like events and @xmath48 for cascade events  @xcite .",
    "we then integrate the flux times the effective area over the energy for each bin .    for track - like events due to @xmath3 ,",
    "the event rate is @xmath49_{\\rm cc}\\,\\frac{d\\phi_{\\nu_\\mu}}{ded\\omega } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the density of ice , @xmath51 is avogadro s number ( to convert mass to number of nucleons ) , @xmath52_{\\rm cc}$ ] is the neutrino - nucleon cross section for the charged - current interaction , and @xmath53 is the effective volume of the detector for track - like events  @xcite .",
    "note that we do not add the residual atmospheric muon background to the background of track - like events due to the uncertainty in its value .    for cascade events we use the instrumented volume @xmath54  @xcite , the charged - current interaction for @xmath20 , and the neutral - current interaction for all flavors to obtain @xmath55_{\\rm cc}\\,\\frac{d\\phi_{\\nu_{e,\\tau}}}{ded\\omega }   + [ \\sigma_{\\nu n}(e)]_{\\rm nc}\\,\\frac{d\\phi_{\\nu_{e,\\mu,\\tau}}}{ded\\omega}\\right)\\;.\\ ] ] unlike track - like events , cascade events",
    "are well contained , so the effective volume for their detection will vary little with energy .",
    "also , we assume that in neutral - current interactions all the energy of the neutrino goes into the cascade .",
    "taking partial energy transfer into account would yield a modest improvement in significance , since most of the signal is from @xmath20 charged - current interactions but most of the background is from @xmath3 neutral - current interactions .    finally ,",
    "because the pointing capability for cascades is approximately @xmath56  @xcite and the pointing capability for track - like events has yet to be established , we integrate over the @xmath57 field of view around the galactic center . as mentioned before",
    ", this should provide a constraint which is robust to changes in dark matter halo profile .",
    "specifically , the fractional change between the nfw profile used here and the much less steep isothermal profile for @xmath58 is @xmath59 , and for @xmath60 is @xmath61 .      for comparison to the deepcore constraints from down - going fluxes",
    ", we calculate the constraint from the isotropic diffuse flux limit for amanda - ii from track - like events  @xcite and the projected limit for icecube from cascade events  @xcite .    the main contribution from dark matter decay to the isotropic diffuse flux",
    "is that from extragalactic dark matter residing on cosmological scales .",
    "the flux from the decay of cosmological dark matter is given by the previously derived  @xcite formula @xmath62 where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 being the redshift , @xmath65 is the hubble constant , @xmath66 is the critical density , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are , respectively , the total matter , dark matter , and dark energy densities divided by the critical density  @xcite .",
    "the isotropic diffuse flux from the annihilations of cosmological dark matter is too small to be relevant , since the density of dark matter on cosmological scales is very low , and the flux is suppressed by another power of @xmath70 .    because of the loss of signal due to event selection and the presence of background fluxes , both the amanda - ii limit and the projected icecube limit are only valid at energies greater than @xmath71 tev .",

    "moreover , these constraints are highly robust to the choice of dark matter halo profile and independent of dark matter - nucleon cross section .    in closing , we note two interesting possibilities for future work .",
    "first , if the pointing accuracy for track - like events at icecube+deepcore is established to be less than @xmath81 , the signal - to - noise for annihilations may be significantly enhanced by observing a smaller region around the galactic center , possibly out - performing cascade searches ( albeit with greater dependence on the choice of dark matter halo profile ) .",
    "this would strengthen the discovery potential for dark matter because the galactic center could be identified as a localized source of excess neutrinos .",
    "second , because the @xmath43 atmospheric background is so low at energies above 40 gev and at low zenith angles , if icecube+deepcore can demonstrate efficient @xmath43 discrimination  @xcite , signal to noise could be increased by a factor @xmath82 .",
