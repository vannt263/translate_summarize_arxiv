    "interactions of cosmic - ray nuclei with interstellar gas nuclei in our galaxy produce secondary pions .",
    "the neutral pions then decay to produce most of the galactic @xmath1-rays above 0.1 gev which have been observed  @xcite ; the decay of the charged pions produces galactic cosmic - ray neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out 30 years ago that the distribution of high energy @xmath1-rays  in our galaxy is related to the distribution of molecular clouds and very young hot high - mass stars in ob associations which are short - lived and explode into supernovae  @xcite .",
    "this association between supernovae which are likely to produce cosmic rays and dense regions of molecular gas led to the scenario where interactions between the gas and cosmic rays then produce the @xmath1-rays  _ via _ the decay of the @xmath4 mesons produced in these interactions . a natural implication",
    "then would be that galaxies which were undergoing a phase of extremely active star formation would be likely sources of high energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "such sources are known as `` starburst galaxies '' .",
    "detailed model calculations have been made to predict @xmath1-rayfluxes above 100 mev for the starburst galaxies arp 220  @xcite and ngc 253  @xcite .",
    "the predicted flux for arp 220 is close to the sensitivity limit for the _ glast _ large area telescope whereas the predicted flux for ngc 253 is an order of magnitude higher than that sensitivity limit and close to the upper limit obtained from the _ egret _ data  @xcite .",
    "loeb and waxman ( lw ) have suggested that such hadronic processes in starbust galaxies , involving cosmic ray interactions with interstellar gas followed by the decay of @xmath5 s , can produce , _ in toto _ , a large enough background of diffuse high energy neutrinos to be observable  @xcite with a very large neutrino detector such as _ icecube _  @xcite .",
    "lw then argue that radio observations of starburst galaxies imply a _",
    "lower limit _ on the cumulative extragalactic neutrino flux from starburst galaxies which is within the sensitivity range of _",
    "icecube_. this argument is examined here and the opposite conclusion is obtained .",
    "indeed , we derive an _ upper limit _ to the cumulative high energy neutrino flux from starburst galaxies . the diffuse flux of gev @xmath1-rays  from the same processes is found to be @xmath2@xmath3 of the observed @xmath1-raybackground , much less than the component from unresolved blazars and more than an order of magnitude below the estimate of thompson _ _  @xcite .",
    "lw start with the observed synchrotron emission from starburst galaxies which is produced by relativistic electrons in these sources  @xcite .",
    "they then make the assumptions that ( 1 ) the presence of relativistic electrons in these sources implies the presence of relativistic protons , ( 2 ) the protons lose essentially all of their energy to pion production , and ( 3 ) , a lower limit to the energy loss rate of the protons can then be obtained from the synchrotron radio flux by assuming that all of the electrons ( and positrons ) which are radiating are from pion decay .",
    "assumption ( 1 ) is a reasonable one which is supported by observations of cosmic rays in our own milky way galaxy .",
    "assumption ( 3 ) , _ viz .",
    "_ , the `` lower limit '' assumption depends on assumption ( 2 ) .",
    "however , assumptions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be questioned because ( a ) the synchrotron radiating electrons may be largely accelerated primaries rather than secondaries related to pion production and decay as is the case in our own galaxy , and ( b ) the conditions in starburst galaxies are significantly different from those in our own galaxy . in particular , starburst galaxies exhibit strong `` superwinds ''  @xcite .",
    "such winds have significant dynamical effects and may disrupt magnetic fields and drive protons out of these galaxies before they can lose all of their energy by interacting with interstellar gas nuclei to produce pions .",
    "in contrast , assumption ( 2 ) of lw assumes full trapping of relativistic nuclei in the disks of starburst galaxies to the point where they only lose energy in hadronic interactions with gas atoms .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the situation in our own galaxy .",
    "( see footnote 2 . )",
    "these two caveats call into serious question the argument that the radio data can provide a true lower limit on the cumulative diffuse flux of neutrinos from starburst galaxies .",
    "let us , however , ignore them and consider that assumptions ( 1)-(3 ) are reasonable for obtaining an analytic _ upper limit _ for such a flux .",
    "let us then accept the other estimates which lead to the ratio of injected power of protons to electrons at a fixed particle energy , @xmath6 and a neutrino luminosity which is then related to the local radio luminosity density by    @xmath7_{f = 1.4 ghz}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the age of the universe and @xmath9 is an evolution factor which takes account of the fact that starburst galaxies were more numerous in the past  @xcite .",
    "lw take the local energy production rate per unit volume at a frequency f = 1.4 ghz to be @xmath10 w mpc@xmath11 .",
    "let us reexamine this value for @xmath12_{f = 1.4 ghz}$ ] .",
    "the local 1.4 ghz energy production rate has been derived by lw by making use of an important connection bewteen radio emission and far infrared ( fir ) emission in galaxies given in the paper of yun , reddy and condon ( yrc )  @xcite . that paper uses the data on _ iras _",
    "galaxies to derive the local infrared luminosity density at 60 @xmath13 m to be @xmath14 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "this _ total _",
    "power density is then used by lw to obtain the 1.4 ghz power density _ via _ a strong empirical correlation between the fir and 1.4 ghz luminosity densities .",
    "the key difference between the result to be derived here and that obtained by lw is in chosing how to interpret the paper of yrc .",
    "yrc state that less than 10% of the local fir luminosity density is contributed by luminous ir galaxies with @xmath15 ; this is the component which includes the starburst galaxies .",
    "( figure 11 of yrc yields an estimate of @xmath0 6% . )",
    "if we take the local contribution from starburst galaxies at 60@xmath13 m to be @xmath16 ( the 10% upper limit found by yrc ) , using the relation ( 4 ) of yrc as shown in their fig .",
    "5(a ) one finds that the component of the local radio luminosity density related to the starburst galaxies is at most @xmath17 w hz@xmath18mpc@xmath11 which , when multiplied by 1.4 ghz , gives @xmath19 w mpc@xmath11 .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude lower than the flux obtained by lw  @xcite .",
    ", much steeper than the @xmath20 spectrum assumed by lw .",
    "this spectrum probably reflects both a steeper composite source spectrum and a shorter confinement time than those at lower energies . ]",
    "this is not the whole story because there is a higher relative fraction of the energy input from the higher relative number of starburst galaxies at higher redshifts . to estimate this effect , we assume that the fir background is proportional to the integrated star formation activity rate .",
    "the fraction of the fir background , @xmath21 contributed by galaxies in different redshift ranges , @xmath22 , is obtained from ref .",
    ". then we multiply @xmath23 ) by the fraction of the fir background contributed by starburst galaxies in different redshift ranges , @xmath24 , to estimate the mean fraction of the total fir background contributed by starburst galaxies .",
    "estimates for @xmath25 and @xmath26 are shown in table 1 .",
    "table 1 : relative contributions to the @xmath27 starburst galaxy flux ( see text ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 2 shows a comparison of the upper limit on the flux from starburst galaxies given here with the atmospheric neutrino flux and with approximate model predictions of neutrino fluxes @xmath1-ray  bursts ( grb ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) along with detector array sensitivities .",
    "it can be seen from this table that at 100 tev none of the extragalactic sources proposed will dominate over the atmospheric foreground .",
    "the table shows that the present preliminary upper limit on the diffuse neutrino energy flux below 1 pev from amanda - ii is @xmath28 gev @xmath29 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 in the 10 tev to 1 pev energy range  @xcite .",
    "the full _ icecube _ detector array is expected to push down to a sensitivity of @xmath30 gev @xmath29 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 in the energy range 100 tev @xmath31 100 pev after several years of observation . under the extreme assumption",
    "that the primary cosmic ray spectra in all starburst galaxies are as hard as @xmath20 up to energies @xmath2(10 pev ) , pev neutrinos from starburst galaxies may be detectable just above the projected sensitivity of _",
    "icecube_. gev @xmath29 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 .",
    "] however , as can be seen from table 2 , above 1 pev the agn models predict fluxes which will be significantly larger than the the atmospheric foreground ( expected to be @xmath32 gev @xmath29 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 at 1 pev ) , as well as the fluxes from @xmath1-ray  bursts ( grb ) and starburst galaxies .",
    "in a follow - up paper to lw , thompson _ _  @xcite have estimated the contribution of @xmath33-decay @xmath1-rays  from starburst galaxies to the observed @xmath1-ray  background in the gev energy range . using an @xmath20 primary spectrum they get estimates of @xmath34 fluxes for both @xmath1-rays  and neutrinos of @xmath35 gev @xmath29 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 .",
    "this is a factor of 3 larger than the neutrino flux of lw because they estimate that all of the electrons in these galaxies are from @xmath5 decay and they make the further hypothesis that a significant fraction the synchrotron radiating electrons which emit at 1.4 ghz lose energy by processes other than synchotron radiation ( _ viz .",
    "_ , bremsstrahlung and ionization in dense gas clouds .",
    ") should the diffuse differential neutrino particle spectrum continue @xmath36 up to 10 tev and above , the flux predicted in ref .",
