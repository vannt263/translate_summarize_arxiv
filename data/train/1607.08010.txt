    "the study of jet physics in high energy scattering has reached a sophisticated level .",

    "more differential quantities such as the transverse momentum dependence of the final - state particles or jets @xcite , and the jet substructures @xcite have been studied .",
    "though we probe more differential quantities , not all the factorization theorems are provided yet .",
    "but the factorization theorems should be proved since they offer a fundamental basis for theoretical predictive power .",
    "in general , the factorization theorem states that the prediction for physical observables consists of the product or the convolution of the hard , the collinear and the soft parts . in proving the factorization theorem for various scattering processes ,",
    "it is important to verify that each factorized part is infrared ( ir ) finite .",
    "otherwise the dependence of the renormalization scale does not solely come from the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence , which invalidates the scaling behavior of the factorized parts .",
    "if some components are not ir finite in the factorized form , the factorized parts should be reshuffled such that the redefined or rearranged quantities are ir finite . if the ir divergence remains even after the rearrangement , the quantity at hand is not physical .",
    "a fully inclusive quantity is ir finite to all orders due to the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem @xcite since the ir divergence from the virtual correction is cancelled by that of the real correction .",
    "it should hold true also for exclusive physical quantities such as the dijet cross section , in which the phase space for the real gluon emission is constrained by the jet algorithm .",
    "the verification that each factorized part is ir finite in the dijet cross section from @xmath1 annihilation with various jet algorithms has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , here we take the dijet cross section in hadron - hadron collision near threshold with a cone - type jet algorithm @xcite to show explicitly that each factorized part is ir finite by carefully dissecting the phase space and performing the corresponding computation .",
    "this process is more complicated due to the complex color structure and the existence of the beam hadrons , thus more illuminating to show how to disentangle the interwoven structure of divergence .",
    "the dijet cross section in hadron - hadron collision near threshold is shown to be factorized into the hard , collinear and soft parts , which is schematically written as @xmath2 a more rigorous expression will be derived in sec .",
    "[ fact ] . here",
    "@xmath3 is the hard function depending only on the hard scales , and @xmath4 is the soft function which describes the soft interactions among the energetic particles .",
    "the hard and soft functions are matrices in color space because they arise from different color channels . near threshold ,",
    "the incoming partons are described by the collinear distribution functions @xmath5 , for the parton @xmath6 to be contained in the hadron @xmath7 , rather than the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath8 .",
    "the distinction will be discussed later . and @xmath9 are the integrated jet functions describing the outgoing collinear particles prescribed by a jet algorithm in the final state .    , and @xmath10",
    ", the partons with the momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 undergo a hard scattering . the two jets with their momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 are produced .",
    "the soft momentum @xmath15 is either inside or outside the jet depending on the jet algorithm .",
    "[ scheme],width=188 ]    the configuration of the dijet production near threshold is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "the incoming partons with momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 take most of the momenta from the two hadrons with momenta @xmath16 and @xmath10 and participate in the hard collision .",
    "then the partonic cm frame coincides with the hadronic cm frame .",
    "jet algorithms in @xmath1 annihilation and in hadron - hadron scattering are different since the latter should preserve the boost invariance along the beam direction .",
    "however , near threshold , we can employ the same cone - type jet algorithm with the rescaling of the jet radius @xcite .",
    "for central jets with the rapidity close to zero , the cone - type jet algorithms in both cases take the same form .",
    "since the partons are back to back in the hadronic cm frame near threshold , the resultant dijets are also produced back to back .",
    "away from the threshold , the dijets do not have to be back to back , and the initial - state particles also form beam jets in the beam direction . in this case , the factorized form for the jet cross section retains almost the same form except that the collinear distribution functions are replaced by the beam functions @xcite , describing the emission of the collinear particles along the initial parton from the hadron . this case will be investigated later , and here we consider the dijets near threshold .    in every high - energy process , the ir finiteness should be guaranteed , but here we focus on the dijet cross section to illustrate how carefully the uv and ir divergences should be treated . we examine various radiative corrections by carefully separating the uv and ir divergences and show that each factorized part is indeed ir finite .",
    "this type of analysis should be applied to other various differential processes for the rigorous proof of the factorization theorems .",
    "the claim that the factorization of the cross section is established is to verify that each factorized part should be free of ir divergence .",
    "numerous types of computations have been performed to extract the uv divergence either by applying the dimensional regularization or by introducing some ir regulators . in many cases ,",
    "the divergences appearing in the computation are regarded as the uv divergence based on the belief that the factorized parts are physical quantities , hence should be free of ir divergence . however , the mere separation of the long- and short - distance effects via the factorization guarantees in no way that each factorized part is ir finite .",
    "it should be rather explicitly checked than presumed .",
    "if each factorized part is ir free , the factorization theorem remains valid . if not , a new combination should be devised such that there is no ir divergence in the recombined parts .",
    "in fact , if the divergences are carefully distinguished , there may remain ir divergence , which endangers the validity of the factorization .",
    "this aspect will be investigated in detail here .    only after the remaining divergence",
    "is guaranteed to be of the uv origin , we can safely apply the renormalization group equation to resum large logarithms . in this paper",
    ", we employ the pure dimensional regularization with the spacetime dimension @xmath17 and the @xmath18 scheme , in which we carefully distinguish the uv and the ir divergences in computing radiative corrections of the jet and soft functions with a jet algorithm . especially in the soft function , there exist ir divergences if we naively apply the jet algorithm .",

    "this section constitutes the main idea and technique in this paper .      at the parton level , the dijet production from hadron - hadron scattering and the process @xmath99 jets are similar since they are related by the crossing symmetry .",

    "however , it turns out that the anomalous dimension of the soft function depending on the jet cone size is diagonal in color basis , which cancels the cone size dependence of the anomalous dimension in the jet function .",

    "but this topic will be deferred .    though the phase space is constrained by the jet algorithm as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] , the structure of the divergence depends on which soft wilson lines participate in the soft function .",
    "the integrand in computing the real gluon emission can be obtained by expanding the corresponding soft wilson lines , and is of the form @xmath120 the characteristics of @xmath121 are categorized into three classes : the jet - jet contribution @xmath122 , the beam - beam contribution @xmath123 , and the beam - jet contributions for the remaining combinations of @xmath124 .",
    "the three classes have different structure of divergence .    for the jet - jet contribution @xmath122 ,",
    "the denominator of @xmath121 becomes singular when the momentum @xmath125 approaches zero or collinear to @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the uv or ir divergences arise in each of the phase space specified in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] ( a ) .",
    "however , when the virtual corrections are added , the soft part in the jet - jet contribution becomes ir finite @xcite .",
    "for the beam - beam contribution @xmath126 , the denominator never becomes singular unless @xmath125 approaches zero since the gluon momentum should be close to the jet directions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and away from the beam directions @xmath27 , @xmath28 . due to this fact , the contributions from the first two conditions of the jet algorithm in eq .",
    "( [ softjet ] ) ( blue region ) do not induce any ( collinear ) ir divergence and the contribution from that phase space is suppressed by @xmath127 .",
    "the detailed calculation of the explicit contribution to order @xmath128 is presented in appendix  [ bjsoft ] .",
    "therefore the only divergence comes from the region specified by the jet veto , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] ( b ) , in which we show only the region of the phase space which yields the ir divergence . here",
    "it is hard to visualize the @xmath129 and @xmath130 lines in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] ( b ) and ( c ) , so they are expressed as dashed lines for convenience .",
    "the contribution from the gluons in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions is critical in treating the ir divergence .",
    "this point will be discussed in detail .    for the beam - jet contributions , for example , @xmath131 or @xmath111 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] ( c ) , the denominator becomes singular when the momentum approaches zero or is collinear to @xmath33 . when the momentum is collinear to @xmath32 , the contribution is finite and suppressed by @xmath132 for the same reason as in the beam - beam contribution .",
    "therefore the divergence occurs in the phase space , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] ( c ) .",
    "we can also consider the cases with @xmath112 or @xmath113 , and the phase space which results in the ir divergence is given by the blue region near the @xmath114 axis instead along with the jet veto .",
    "considering the fact that the soft function from the jet - jet contributions with the virtual corrections is ir finite , we can see that the soft functions from the beam - jet and the beam - beam contributions should contain ir divergence because the ir divergence from the jet algorithms for the @xmath32 or @xmath33 jets or both is missing .",
    "this presents a predicament since the ir - divergent soft function loses its physical meaning .",
    "there must be another source for the ir divergence which cancels the existing divergence as mentioned above . that contribution is related to the emission of gluons exactly in the beam directions .",
    "when a soft gluon is emitted outside the jet , its energy should be less than @xmath133 according to the jet veto .",
    "the beam directions also belong to the region outside the jet",
    ". however , when a soft gluon is emitted exactly in the beam directions , that is , in the @xmath27 or @xmath28 directions , the jet topology also corresponds to a dijet event . in this case",
    ", the energy of the soft gluon can be larger than the jet veto , and this contribution should be added in calculating the soft function .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath1 annihilation , there is no such contribution since there are no incoming hadrons in the beam direction .",
    "one of the main themes in this paper is to extract these contributions in order to show that the soft function becomes ir finite with this additional contribution .",
    "we can consider a more general case away from the threshold , in which there are two central jets and two beam jets .",
    "then the emission of soft gluons in the beam direction does not have to be exactly collinear to the incoming particles , and can be smeared to be inside the beam jets .",
    "then it requires a beam algorithm analogous to the jet algorithm to treat the soft gluon in the beam directions . in this case",
    ", the anomalous dimensions may depend also on the size of the beam jets , and there may be nonglobal logarithms @xcite related to the different sizes of the central jets and the beam jets .",
    "this may be interesting , but we will not consider this case here , and it is the topic to be pursued later . in a sense , the collinear distribution function in the dijet event near threshold corresponds to the beam function with the zero beam size .",
    "before we compute the soft functions , there are two important points which should be handled with care in using the dimensional regularization to separate the uv and the ir divergences .",
    "first , the ingredient to separate the uv and ir divergences is based on the fact that @xmath134 where @xmath135 has the dimension of a momentum . in the naive dimensional regularization in which the uv and ir divergences are not distinguished ,",
    "the integral vanishes since it is a scaleless integral .",
    "the uv divergence is extracted as a pole in @xmath136 by inserting an arbitrary ir regulator .",
    "using the fact that the overall integral is zero , the ir divergence as a pole in @xmath137 is obtained as in eq .",
    "( [ basicd ] ) .    secondly , in the virtual corrections of the soft functions , there appears an integral of the form @xmath138 the only point we can claim about the integral is that it vanishes in the naive dimensional regularization , hence the integral is proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "other than this observation , the result of the integration is ambiguous . to see why , let us consider two possible ways to compute this integral .",
    "the first method is to treat the variables separately and it can be written as @xmath140 then @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 on the other hand , the integral can also be performed by introducing the polar coordinates @xmath143 , @xmath144 , as @xmath145 the integral on @xmath146 yields both the uv and ir divergences , while the angular integral produces only the ir divergence .",
    "therefore @xmath141 is given by @xmath147 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) , the integrals are indeed proportional to @xmath139 , but they are different .",
    "now the question is which one should be employed in actual computations .",
    "we emphasize that the treatment of the virtual correction is not determined by the virtual correction alone , but is determined by how the real gluon emission is computed .",
    "the ambiguity of the divergences in the soft function was also pointed out in refs .",
    "the point is that the method in computing the virtual and the real contributions should be performed in the same way .",
    "usually the real gluon emission is complicated when the jet algorithm is implemented .",
    "the phase space for the virtual correction is simpler than that of the real contribution , hence the computation is more versatile in the virtual correction .",
    "thus we calculate the virtual correction in the same way as we compute the real gluon emission .",
    "the argument can be justified as follows : if there is no constraint for the soft gluon emission , the whole phase space is covered , and the contribution is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "the virtual correction has the same form as the real gluon emission except the sign .",
    "the whole soft contribution at one loop , as well as all the divergences , vanishes as long as we maintain the same method of calculation either eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "actually the inclusive soft function for the real gluon emission receives no radiative corrections to all orders .",
    "if we employ different methods for the virtual and real corrections , the result can not be zero .",
    "this argument also holds for the computation of the soft function with the jet algorithm .",
    "the correct divergence structure is obtained only when the same method is applied consistently to the virtual and the real contributions .",
    "the question remains whether the final finite answer could be the same irrespective of the different treatment for @xmath141 .",
    "the jet - jet contribution has been computed using eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we will show here that the same answer is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) with the angular integral in the real gluon emission .",
    "note also that the different divergence structure in eqs .",
