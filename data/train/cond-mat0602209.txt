    "semiconductor superlattices ( ssls ) @xcite have attracted growing attention in view of their unique electronic properties , which can be used for generation , amplification and detection of a high - frequency electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "a dc - biased ssl , operating in the conditions of single miniband transport regime and demonstrating the static negative differential conductance , can be potentially used as an active element of thz field generator @xcite .",
    "however , the static negative differential conductance makes ssl unstable against a formation of high - field electric domains @xcite .",
    "the electric domains are believed to be destructive for the thz gain in ssls @xcite .",
    "currently the main focus is on the possibilities to overcome this drawback within the scheme of dc - biased ssl @xcite .",
    "however , schemes of thz superlattice devices with ac pump fields are also under discussion @xcite .",
    "a strong microwave field @xmath0 pumps the ssl and a desirable signal field @xmath1 has a higher frequency @xmath2 .",
    "because for typical ssls the characteristic scattering time @xmath3 at room temperature is of the order of @xmath4 fs , an interaction of the microwave fields with the miniband electrons is quasistatic ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "importantly , we have showed recently that such quasistatic pump field can completely suppress domains in ssls @xcite .",
    "two distinct possibilities exist for the signal field : it can be also quasistatic ( @xmath6 ) or it can not be described within the quasistatic approach if @xmath7 . the later situation , i.e. @xmath5 but",
    "@xmath7 , can be called _",
    "semiquasistatic interaction_. thus , the semiquasistatic approach is introduced to describe an amplification of thz field in ssl under the action of microwave field .",
    "we should note that while in the experiments @xcite the interaction of electrons with both pump and signal fields is still quasistatic and , moreover , it is probably domains - mediated , the ultimate goal of this activity is to reach a parametric thz generation without electric domains @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can say that the semiquasistatic approach describes the real experimental situations as well .    in this paper",
    ", we derive several beautiful formulas describing a high - frequency absorption ( gain ) of small - signal field in the presence of ac pump field , when the interaction of the fields with the miniband electrons in the superlattice is semiquasistatic . along with obvious potential applications in the calculations of gain in superlattice devices ,",
    "our theoretical approach provides a powerful tool for finding the correspondence between quasistatic and dynamic regimes in ac - driven superlattices .",
    "our main findings are following .",
    "we consider the response of electrons , belonging to a single miniband of ssl , to an action of the total electric field @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dc bias and @xmath10 is the weak signal ( probe ) field .",
    "we should note that in the real devices @xmath11 is a mode of the resonator tuned to a desirable thz frequency . here",
    "three distinct cases should be considered : ( i ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 are incommensurable , ( ii ) @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is an odd number ) and ( iii ) @xmath16 ( @xmath15 is an integer ) .",
    "the later case of the parametric cascading is most interesting physically @xcite and we mainly focus on it in this paper .",
    "we define the dimensionless absorption of the weak ac probe field in ssl as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scaled miniband electron velocity defined in the units of the maximal miniband velocity @xmath19 @xcite , averaging @xmath20 is performed over time and @xmath21 is the common period for the probe and the pump ac fields .",
    "starting from the exact formal solution of the boltzmann transport equation , we represent the absorption @xmath22 as the sum of three terms @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe the absorption ( gain ) seeded by generation of harmonics , the parametric amplification of the probe field due to a coherent interaction of the pump and the probe fields , and the nonparametric absorption , correspondingly .",
    "the term @xmath24 is just the expression for @xmath15th in - phase harmonic of the time - dependent current through ssl @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dc voltage , @xmath29 is the length of ssl ( @xmath30 is the period of ssl and @xmath31 is the number spatial periods ) , @xmath32 is the amplitude of ac voltage created by the pump field across ssl , the current @xmath33 is normalized to the maximal current in ssl , @xmath34 , corresponding to the maximal miniband velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the explicit expressions for the @xmath15th harmonic of the current , that determine the dependence @xmath35 , are well - known ( see @xcite for the case of a small pump amplitude , @xmath36 , and @xcite for the case of an arbitrary @xmath37 ) . note that @xmath24 does not depend on the probe ; it gives the main contribution to the absorption of a weak probe @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath24 is not specific for the semiquasistic limit because of its independence on @xmath12 .",

    "we will present simple but instructive geometric interpretations of the formulas ( [ coh ] ) and ( [ inc ] ) allowing to find the high - frequency absorption components directly using only the ruler and the knowledge of the quasistatic curves @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these geometric interpretations provide a powerful tool in a search of the optimum conditions for the gain which employs only a simple qualitative analysis .    if the frequency of the probe @xmath12 incommensurates with the frequency of the pump @xmath13 , the expression for the absorption at @xmath12 consists of only one term  the incoherent absorption @xmath54 with semiquasistatic limit ( [ inc ] ) .",

    "in summary , we calculated a small - signal absorption ( gain ) of a high - frequency field in semiconductor superlattice driven by a quasistatic ac field . in particular , our theoretical approach well describes practically interesting cases of generation and amplification of thz signal in superlattice devices pumped by a microwave field .",
    "we presented transparent geometrical interpretations for the coherent and the incoherent contributions to the net absorption at the different ratio of the pump ( @xmath13 ) and the signal ( @xmath12 ) frequencies .",
    "we demonstrated that the use of these geometric pictures sufficiently simplifies analysis : it is easy to find gain for a signal with an arbitrary @xmath12 using the electric characteristics of superlattice formed under microwave fields .",
    "in particular , we proved that for @xmath74 being some irrational number a small - signal gain at @xmath12 is possible only in the condition of static negative differential conductance .",
    "next , we also found that an absorption at an arbitrary @xmath12 , that equals to some half - integer of the pump frequency , is always zero in an unbiased superlattice . at least but not last",
    ", we presented the universal analytic procedure for finding the behavior of different physically important variables in the quasistatic limit starting from the exact solution of the boltzmann transport equations for superlattices .",
    "numerical calculations confirmed our analytic findings and also demonstrated that the semiquasistatic formulas for absorption work reasonable well even beyond their formal range of validity .",
    "our results can be generalized to other physical systems where the miniband transport regime exist , such as carbon nanotubes @xcite or dissipative optical lattices @xcite .",
    "although in this work we used only a single scattering time , our results obtained within semiquasistatic approximation can be also applied to a more realistic case of two different relaxation times for electron energy and electron momentum . really , within the approximation of two relaxation times the static voltage - current characteristic of superlattice still has the esaki - tsu form @xcite . because in the semiquasistatic approach only the ( quasi)static voltage - current characteristic plays a role , we speculate that a variation of the ratio of relaxation times can lead only to a some change in absolute value of the absorption but not in its dependence on the amplitude of pump field .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations of the superlattice balance equations @xcite confirm these speculations @xcite . the detailed consideration of thz absorption with the use of two different relaxation times will be published elsewhere .",
    "it is instructive to consider our activity from the viewpoint of its place among other works devoted to the use of the quantum derivatives or , other words , to the use of the finite differences in expressions for currents . in the theory of semiconductor superlattices ,",
    "the quantum derivative has been first introduced in @xcite for calculations of the absorption of weak monochromatic ac field in dc - biased superlattice .",
    "later the formula has been used in the calculations of the response function of thz superlattice detector @xcite and in the finding of thz gain in the models of generalized bloch oscillator with suppressed domains @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these formulas for superlattices appears to be same as the formulas describing the response of two - terminal structures to the action of dc and ac voltages @xcite .",
    "the latter are widely used for calculations of signal mixing in the josephson junctions operating in the qusiparticle transport regime and in other single - barrier tunnel devices @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "this paper is the first work , where the quantum derivatives naturally appeared in a description of microstructure s response to a bichromatic field .",
    "it is an exciting problem to understand whether our semiquasistatic approach , developed for superlattices operating in the miniband transport regime , can be generalized to other tunnelling structures .",
