    "<S> , there must be no degree of freedom ( other than polarization ) which provides the which - path information . in the case of identical qds , with zero fine - structure splitting , the which - path information is partially provided by the time correlation between the red and blue photons ; hence the nonoptimal value of @xmath69 ( eq .

    "<S> let s consider , for example , the case where a blue photon in d@xmath11 is detected before a red one in d@xmath8 ( @xmath119 , where @xmath120 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such two photons can not proceed from the same emitter , for each dot emits two photons in a well defined time ordering , with the red photon first . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to distinguish from one another the paths represented in panels ( a - c ) or ( b - d ) , and the distinguishability of the two paths results in a partial loss of the interference visibility @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the visibility is here directly related to the probability @xmath122 that one of the two dots emits a blue photons before the other has emitted a red one @xcite : @xmath123    besides the time correlation between the red and blue photons , the which - path information can be provided by the fine - structure splitting and by possible differences in the emission frequencies of the two dots . in order to account for these effects </S>",

    "<S> , the relevant interference is now between paths that differ from one another only in the source of the photon that reaches each detector . </S>",

    "<S> such condition corresponds to quantum emitters with identical emission frequencies , but does nt imply a vanishing fine - structure splitting in either dot . besides , no indistinguishability is required between two photons emitted in cascade by a given dot , and two emitted by different dots in distinct cascade decays . in the absence of a quantum erasure </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum of @xmath132 can only be achieved if both dots have vanishing fine - structure splitting ( panel ( b ) ) , and remains below the theoretical limit unless @xmath133 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the efficiency of the entanglement swapping procedure based on the cascade decay of qds can not be reduced to the amount of frequency - polarization entanglement present within each pair . a relevant role is also played by the differences in the emission frequencies of the two dots and by the time correlation between cascaded photons . </S>",
    "<S> these effects , along with the fine - structure splitting , potentially provide the which - path information , thus reducing the visibility of the four - photon interference , and the success probability of the entanglement swapping procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the detrimental effect of time correlation can be eliminated by engineering the ratio of the photon emission rates . for identical emitters , </S>",
