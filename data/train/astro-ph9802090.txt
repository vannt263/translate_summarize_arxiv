    "the main motivation to study solar wind composition is to obtain information on the isotopic composition of elements in the sun .",
    "this is important because the sun constitutes @xmath6 of solar system matter , and for most elements the solar composition could provide the most reliable information on the composition of the primordial solar nebula .",
    "because nowhere in the sun have temperatures ever been high enough to alter isotopic abundances of heavy elements by nuclear reactions , solar ca is thought to reflect the original isotopic composition in the solar nebula . yet , most of what is known of solar isotopic abundances is inferred from terrestrial and from meteoritic abundances with a few exceptions : recently , the isotopic composition of solar wind magnesium , the first analysis of the isotopic abundances of a refractive element in solar matter measured in situ with the spacecraft borne mass spectrometer wind / mass , has been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solar isotopic composition of the volatile noble gases helium and neon have been determined in situ with the apollo foil experiments ( @xcite ) . in situ measurements with celias / mtof ( @xcite ) on board soho",
    "have confirmed that the solar neon isotopic composition differs significantly from the terrestrial and meteoritic abundances .",
    "isotopic abundances also have been determined for several elements ( c , n , o , he , ne , mg ) in the higher energy ( above 10 mev / amu ) solar energetic particles ( @xcite ) . from similar measurements it has been possible to obtain reliable information on coronal elemental abundances including the abundance of calcium ( @xcite ) . however , the isotopic composition of solar energetic particles ( sep ) may not be representative of the solar composition because fractionation processes occur during the particle acceleration and transport and these processes may vary from event to event .",
    "the far more fluent solar wind is the most authentic sample of the solar source composition . from recent theoretical models ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "it is expected that the isotopic fractionation in the solar wind flow due to differences in coulomb drag depletes the heavier isotopes by at most a few percent .",
    "therefore measurements of the solar wind isotopic abundances of the heavy element calcium together with previous measurements of magnesium abundances provide additional evidence that the solar isotopic composition of refractive elements agrees with terrestrial and meteoritic values .",
    "the mtof sensor ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) of celias ( charge , element , and isotope analysis system ) on board the soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) spacecraft is an isochronous time - of - flight mass spectrometer ( @xcite ) with a resolution m/@xmath7 m of better than 100 .",
    "this provides the possibility of resolving the different isotopes of almost all solar wind elements in the range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 atomic mass units ( amu ) .",
    "the instrument detects ions at solar wind bulk velocities of 300 to 1000 km / s , corresponding to energies of about 0.3 to 3 kev / amu .",
    "details on the principle of operation , the calibration of the instrument functions , and the format of the data transferred by the telemetry can be found in the initial publication on celias / mtof isotope abundance measurements of solar wind neon ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we only briefly describe the instrument characteristics which are necessary to understand the quantitative evaluation of time - of - flight ( tof ) spectra .",
    "highly charged solar wind ions enter the instrument ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) through the wave ( wide angle variable energy ) entrance system that has an energy - per - charge ( @xmath10 ) acceptance bandwidth of about half a decade , and a conic field of view of @xmath11 width ( @xcite ) .",
    "all calcium isotopes have approximately the same bulk velocity , the same charge state , and the same width of the drifting maxwellian velocity distribution so that the heavier isotopes have a higher center @xmath10 .",
    "the strongest instrumental fractionation occurs when the center @xmath10 of either isotope coincides with one of the edges of the @xmath10-acceptance of the wave .",
    "the acceptance function including the ion optical effects of the postacceleration voltage to the time - of - flight section has been well analyzed in the calibration system for mass spectrometers ( @xcite ) of the university of bern ( uob ) .",
    "therefore the flight data can reliably be filtered with respect to the ion optical instrument discrimination for any element or isotope detected in the solar wind .",
    "a much weaker instrumental fractionation is due to the element specific detection efficiencies of the vmass subsystem which is a v - shaped isochronous time - of - flight spectrometer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the double coincidence rate over the front secondary electron detection assembly rate has been measured as a function of ion energy per mass with a @xmath0ca@xmath12 beam of the mefisto laboratory at uob ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model functions reproduce the calibration data very well so that they can be applied to derive the differences in the detection efficiencies of the isotopes @xmath13ca ( figure  [ figca2 ] ) . with very good confidence the uncertainty of these detection efficiencies",
    "can be assumed to be lower than the statistical error evaluated ( see table  [ fit ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figca3 ] shows a spectrum where all pulse height analysis words of the full year 1996 have been collected in the mass range 39 to 45 amu .",
    "tof channel contents have been put into bins six channels wide and the uncertainties of the data points have been estimated by the linear - optimization algorithm of rauch - tung - striebel ( @xcite ) where the filter width corresponds to half the tof resolution of the instrument ; this filter introduces a minor reduction of the peak resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "this algorithm has been applied to improve the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor of four so that @xmath1ca@xmath15 and @xmath4ca@xmath15 can be identified with high significance .",
    "note that most incident ions leave the carbon foil as neutrals or singly charged .",
    "the @xmath0ca@xmath15 distribution is asymmetrically broadened .",
    "it exhibits a different shape than @xmath16ne@xmath15 ( @xcite ) for one main reason : singly charged calcium has generally much higher @xmath10 inside the vmass than singly charged neon so that calcium follows a longer trajectory in the field free region above the ion stop microchannel plate ( imcp ) detector ( @xcite ) .",
    "longer trajectories in the field - free region correspond to longer times of flight .",
    "this leads to the tails of higher channels in the tof distribution of all the mass peaks in figure  [ figca3 ] . as in the case of @xmath17ne@xmath15 ( @xcite )",
    "the electronic ringing peaks are visible at about 30 tof channels to the left of the @xmath13ca@xmath15 signatures ; they arise from reflected start signals .",
    "the tof counts have been weighted by the detection efficiencies for the different calcium isotopes within the window of @xmath18 instrument fractionation between @xmath4ca@xmath15 and @xmath0ca@xmath15 .",
    "all three detectable calcium peaks , @xmath0ca@xmath15 , @xmath1ca@xmath15 , and @xmath4ca@xmath15 , are described by the same model function with identical asymmetric shape . also , the marginally detectable or non - detectable peaks @xmath19k@xmath15 and @xmath20ca@xmath15 are included into the fit function , assuming terrestrial isotopic abundances : @xmath21 } } & \\nonumber\\\\         { + { \\sum_{j=1}^{5}}{{b_j}\\over{1+{{{(t - p_{i}-jl)}^{2}}\\over{w^{2 } } } } } } & \\nonumber\\\\         { + { { c}\\times{exp[-{{{(t - p_{i}+r)}^{2}}\\over{2u^{2}}}]}})}. \\nonumber \\\\ % \\eqnum{1 } \\label{eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath22 is the time - of - flight channel number and the free fit parameters are @xmath23 representing the amplitudes of the @xmath13ca@xmath15 peaks , @xmath24 the main gaussian peak position of @xmath0ca@xmath15 , @xmath25 the shift of the lorentzians describing the asymmetry against the main gaussians for all three peaks of @xmath13ca@xmath15 , @xmath26 the shift of the ringing peaks against the main gaussians , the @xmath27 the relative amplitudes of the shifted lorentzians compared to the main gaussians , @xmath28 the relative amplitude of the ringing peaks , @xmath29 the width of the main gaussian peaks , @xmath30 the width of the lorentzian peaks , and @xmath31 the width of the ringing peaks .",
    "the gaussian peak positions @xmath32 of @xmath19k@xmath15 and @xmath33ca@xmath15 are kept fixed at their calibrated tof channels .",
    "the total amplitudes @xmath23 , the widths @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the relative amplitudes @xmath27 give the abundances for @xmath13ca@xmath15 . this analysis has been done twice assuming that the solar wind calcium is either tenfold or elevenfold charged .",
    "table  [ fit ] lists the integrated counts for @xmath13ca@xmath15 assuming tenfold charged solar wind calcium .",
    "this gives the count ratios @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath1ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath4ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "analogously , assuming elevenfold charged solar wind calcium we find @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath1ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath4ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we further correct these ratios for the effect of heavy elements such as si and fe having different mean velocities in the solar wind compared to the proton velocity @xmath38 derived from the proton monitor data . for ca the mean velocity can be estimated to be 1.027 x @xmath38 - 14.6 km / s ( @xcite ) .",
    "this correction in the mean velocity and therefore in the mean e / q leads to the values @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath1ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath4ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath40 ) for tenfold charged solar wind calcium and @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath1ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath4ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath42 ) for elevenfold charged solar wind calcium . according to  @xcite and  @xcite the coronal freeze - in temperatures for the time period considered in this paper are such that the average solar wind calcium charge state should be somewhere between ten and eleven ;",
    "the average number is approximately 10.5 .",
    "therefore the final values for the solar wind calcium isotopic abundance ratios are taken as the average of the two values derived for the two assumptions of tenfold and elevenfold calcium .",
    "the error of the mean value is chosen sufficiently large to be compatible with both assumptions .",
    "for all ratios an additional uncertainty of @xmath43 is due to uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the instrument acceptance .",
    "this results in @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath1ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath0ca@xmath15/@xmath4ca@xmath15 @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "more precise values can be determined , once the charge distribution of solar wind calcium is better known for the year 1996 with other instrumentation on board the soho spacecraft .",
    "the sensors wind / mass and celias / ctof will provide sufficient information to reevaluate the calcium data .",
    "based on the assumption that the solar wind calcium charge state varies between ten and eleven as a long term average , we find that the isotopic abundance ratios of solar wind calcium are @xmath0ca/@xmath1ca @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath0ca/@xmath4ca @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) . both ratios are consistent with the terrestrial ratios @xmath0ca/@xmath1ca @xmath2 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath0ca/@xmath4ca @xmath2 ( @xmath45 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "more precise values can be obtained once a time series during the year 1996 of the calcium charge states in the solar wind at the soho location is available .",
    "from astrophysical and geochemical considerations it can be concluded that the isotopic composition of photospheric ca must be within small fractions of per mills identical to the terrestrial composition .",
    "the similarity of the solar wind results with the terrestrial values suggests the preliminary conclusion that isotopic fractionation within the solar wind plays a minor role .",
    "this is supported by the model calculations of  @xcite that consider differences in the coulomb drag for isotopes of various elements .",
    "fractionation effects not larger than a few percent are expected for ne and mg . for the heavy element",
    "ca even weaker isotopic fractionation has to be expected .",
    "although there are as yet no detailed evaluations of a more extensive time series with calcium isotopic ratios to be determined in different solar wind regimes , we suggest that the ca abundance discussed in this work is within a few percent of the true solar composition .",
    "table  [ comparison ] shows a comparison between the terrestrial , solar and presolar grain calcium isotopic composition .",
    "there is no evidence for large variations in these isotopic compositions except for the case of the presolar x - grains that originate from supernovae explosions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large enrichment in @xmath4ca in the x - grains is a consequence of the radioactive decay of @xmath4ti in supernovae material .",
