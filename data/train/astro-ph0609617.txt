    "the air shower program , corsika ( version 6204 ) @xcite , has been adapted to run in sea water i.e. a medium of constant density of 1.025 g per @xmath0 rather than the variable density needed for an air atmosphere .",
    "sea water was assumed to consist of a medium in which @xmath1 of the atoms are hydrogen , @xmath2 of the atoms are oxygen and @xmath3 of the atoms are made of common salt , nacl .",
    "the salt was assumed to be a material with atomic weight and atomic number a=29.2 and z=14 , the mean of sodium and chlorine .",
    "the purpose of this is to maintain the structure of the program as closely as possible to the air shower version which had two principal atmospheric components ( oxygen and nitrogen ) with a trace of argon .",
    "the presence of the salt component had an almost undetectable effect on the behaviour of the showers .",
    "other changes made to the program to accomodate the water medium include a modification of the stopping power formula to allow for the density effect in water .",
    "this only affects the energy loss in hadrons since the stopping powers for electrons are part of the egs @xcite package which is used by corsika to simulate the propagation of the electromagnetic component of the shower .",
    "smaller radial binning of the shower was also required since shower radii in water are much smaller than those in air .",
    "in addition the threshold for the lpm effect @xcite , which suppresses pair production from photons and bremsstrahlung from electrons at high energy , was reduced to the much lower value necessary for water .",
    "similarly , the interactions of @xmath4s had to be simulated at lower energy than in air because of the higher density water medium . in all about 100 detailed changes needed to be made to the corsika program to accomodate the water medium .    to test the implementation of the lpm effect @xcite in the program 100 showers from incident gamma ray photons",
    "were generated and the mean depth of the first interaction ( the mean free path ) calculated .",
    "the observed mean free path was found to be in agreement with the expected behaviour when both the suppression of pair production and photonuclear interactions were taken into account ( see figure [ lpmfig ] ) .",
    "this showed that the lpm effect had been properly implemented in corsika .",
    "considerable fluctuations between showers occurred giving the following observed values of the ratios of the root mean square deviations to the mean value in proton showers : rms peak energy deposit to the peak energy deposit was observed to be @xmath5 at @xmath6 gev reducing to @xmath7 @xmath8 gev , that for the depth of the peak position varied from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and for the shower width from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . to smooth out such fluctuations averages of 100 generated showers",
    "will be taken in the following .",
    "the statistical error on the averages is then given by these rms values divided by @xmath13 .",
    "the hadronic energy contributes only about 10@xmath14 to the shower energy at the shower peak , the remainder being carried by the electromagnetic part of the shower .",
    "this is a well known effect in calorimeters .",
    "proton showers were generated in sea water using the program geant4 ( version 8) @xcite and compared with those generated in corsika .",
    "unfortunately , the range of validity of geant4 physics models for hadronic interactions does not extend beyond an energy of @xmath6 gev .",
    "hence the comparison is restricted to energies below this .    figs .",
    "[ long ] show the longitudinal distributions of proton showers at energies of @xmath15 and @xmath6 gev ( averaged over 100 showers ) as determined from geant4 and corsika .",
    "the showers from corsika tend to be slightly broader and with a smaller peak energy than those generated by geant4 .",
    "the difference in the peak height is @xmath16 at @xmath15 gev rising to @xmath17 at energy @xmath6 gev .",
    "[ rad ] show the radial distributions .",
    "the differences in the longitudinal distributions are reflected in the radial distributions . however , the shapes of the radial distributions are very similar between geant4 and corsika .",
    "corsika produces somewhat less ( @xmath18 ) energy than geant4 near the shower axis at depths between 450 and 850 g @xmath19 where most of the energy is deposited .",
    "the acoustic signal from a shower is most sensitive to the distribution near the axis ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the corsika simulation was also compared with the longitudinal shower profile computed in the simulation by alvarez - muniz and zas @xcite .",
    "there was a reasonable agreement between the longitudinal shower shapes from corsika and those shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "however , the number of electrons at the peak of the corsika showers was @xmath18 lower than those from ref .",
    "their procedure involves a fast hybrid monte carlo which simulates one dimensional showers down to a cross over energy below which parameterisations are used .",
    "the total number of electrons produced is sensitive to the lower energy down to which the simulation proceeds , which is not specified in the paper . given this unknown , the agreement between corsika and the simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite is probably satisfactory .",
    "niess and bertin @xcite parameterise the radial density distribution of showers in water as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a normalising constant chosen arbitrarily here at each depth , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 cm or @xmath26 for @xmath27 cm .",
    "this is the parameterisation for pion showers given in @xcite . here",
    "@xmath28 is the depth and @xmath29 is the depth of maximum energy deposition .",
    "the energy deposited per cm at radius @xmath30 is then proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "fig [ bn ] shows the radial distribution from corsika compared with this parameterisation .",
    "there is reasonable agreement between them particularly at small values of @xmath30 .",
    "hence the two should predict similar distributions of the frequencies of acoustic signals from the hadron shower in water .",
    "the saund collaboration @xcite uses the following parameterisation @xcite for the energy deposited per unit depth , @xmath28 , and per unit annular thickness at radius @xmath30 from a shower of energy @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximum shower depth , @xmath35 g @xmath19 is the radiation length and @xmath36 gev is the critical energy in water . the constants @xmath37 where @xmath38 g @xmath19 and @xmath39 .",
    "the radial density is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 g @xmath19 the moliere radius in water and @xmath43 .",
    "fig [ nkg ] shows the radial distributions from corsika compared with the absolute predictions of this parameterisation .",
    "there is qualitative agreement between them .",
    "however , corsika predicts relatively more energy at small @xmath30 i.e. a harder frequency spectrum for acoustic signals .",
    "the corsika program has an option to simulate the interactions of neutrinos at a fixed point @xcite .",
    "the first interaction is generated by the herwig package @xcite .",
    "some problems have been encountered in simulating @xmath44 showers at energies above @xmath45 gev .",
    "however , the package seems to work well at energies below this . at these energies the mean value of the energy transfered to the hadrons in the interaction is about @xmath46 of the incident neutrino energy @xcite and this fluctuates in different interactions between zero and @xmath47 with an rms value of @xmath46",
    ". hence much larger fluctuations occurred for neutrino than for proton showers .",
    "the shapes of the hadron shower profiles for neutrinos were observed to be similar to those generated by proton showers in water at an energy of @xmath46 of the neutrino energy .",
    "the program corsika has been modified to work in a water medium .",
    "hadron and electromagnetic showers can be generated routinely .",
    "neutrino interactions at low energy can be generated by the herwig package interfaced to corsika and it may be possible to extend this to higher energies .",
