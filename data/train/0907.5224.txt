    "we obtain a proof of the bouchard - mario conjecture @xcite . for this purpose , it is essential to use a different parametrization of the lambert curve : @xmath68 the coordinate @xmath69 is the parameter of the laplace transformation , which changes a function in positive integers to a complex analytic function in @xmath69 .",

    "the point at infinity @xmath74 is the ramification point of the projection @xmath72 . in terms of these coordinates ,",

    "the proof of the bouchard - mario conjecture is established as follows .",
    "a topological recursion of @xcite is always given as a residue formula of symmetric differential forms on the spectral curve .",
    "the laplace - transformed cut - and - join equation ( [ eq : main ] ) is an equation among _ primitives _ of differential forms .",
    "we first take the exterior differential of this equation .",
    "we then analyze the role of the residue calculation in the theory of topological recursion @xcite , and find that it is equivalent to evaluating the form at @xmath75 and its conjugate point @xmath76 with respect to the local galois covering @xmath55 near its critical point .",
    "this means all residue calculations are replaced by an algebraic operation of taking the direct image of the differential form via the projection @xmath72 .",
    "we find that the direct image of ( [ eq : main ] ) then becomes identical to the conjectured formula ( [ eq : bmalgebraic ] ) .",

    "among them is a relation to integrable systems such as the kadomtsev - petviashvili equations @xcite . in recent years",
    "these equations have played an essential role in the study of hurwitz numbers @xcite .",
    "since the aim of this paper is to give a proof of the bouchard - mario conjecture and to give a geometric interpretation of the topological recursion for the hurwitz case , we do not address this relation here .",
    "since we relate the nature of the topological recursion and combinatorics by the laplace transform , it is reasonable to ask : what is the _ inverse _ laplace transform of the topological recursion in general ?",
    "this question relates the laplace transformation and the mirror symmetry .",
    "these are interesting topics to be further explored .",
    "it is possible to prove the bouchard - mario formula without appealing to the cut - and - join equation .",

    "the symplectic invariant theory of matrix models @xcite is directly applicable to hurwitz theory .",
    "the discovery of @xcite is that the derivatives of the symplectic invariants of the lambert curve give @xmath84 of ( [ eq : hgell ] ) .",
    "the topological recursion formula of bouchard and mario then automatically follows . a deeper understanding of the interplay between these two totally different techniques is desirable .",
    "although our statement is simple and clear , technical details are quite involved .",
    "we have decided to provide all key details in this paper , believing that some of the analysis may be useful for further study of more general topological recursions .",
    "this explains the length of the current paper in the sections dealing with complex analysis and the laplace transforms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with identifying the generating function ( [ eq : hgell ] ) as the laplace transform of the elsv formula ( [ eq : elsv ] ) in section  [ sect : elsv ] .",

    "we calculate the residues appearing in the topological recursion formula in section  [ sect : residue ] for the case of hurwitz generating functions .",
    "the topological recursion becomes the algebraic relation as presented in theorem  [ thm : bmconj ] . in section  [ sect : laplace ] we prove technical statements necessary for reducing ( [ eq : main ] ) to ( [ eq : bmalgebraic ] ) as a galois average .",
    "the final section  [ sect : proof ] is devoted to proving the bouchard - mario conjecture .    as an effective recursion , ( [ eq : main ] ) and ( [ eq : bmalgebraic ] ) calculate linear hodge integrals , and hence hurwitz numbers through the elsv formula .",

    "we take the direct image with respect to the projection @xmath55 applied to the @xmath461-coordinate component , and then restrict the result to its principal part , meaning that we throw away any terms that contain non - negative powers of any of the @xmath462 s .",

    "the last term of ( [ eq : caj - in - v ] ) requires a separate care .",
