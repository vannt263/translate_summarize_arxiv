    "the data re - processing , reduction , and analysis were performed using ciao 4.0 . starting from the level 1 data products , we first removed pixel randomization from the standard pipeline processing in order to aid in source disentanglement in the dense cluster core .",
    "in addition , for the purposes of faint source detection we applied the background cleaning algorithm for the data taken in vfaint observing mode .",
    "however , as this procedure tends to discard real source counts for relatively bright sources , the background - cleaned data were not used for the spectral analyses discussed in  3 and  4 but were used for the population study in  5 . before coadding the four acis - s images , the individual aspect solutions were reprojected relative to the longest observation ( obsid 7460 ) using the brightest sources in the cluster in order to correct for any differences in the absolute astrometry between the four exposures .        x - ray source detection was performed with the wavdetect tool in ciao . in the crowded cluster core , we also used the pwdetect script @xcite , which tends to be more effective at identifying faint sources near much brighter sources .",

    "in addition , the same test indicates variability only at a 1.7@xmath24 confidence level over the entire set of acis - s observations . on the other hand , based on poisson statistics , we find that the count rate minimum that occurs near @xmath40 ( see bottom panel of fig .",

    "there is also marginal evidence ( at @xmath195% confidence ) for spectral variability , with an apparent softening of the x - ray emission around @xmath40 . due to the long binary period ,",
    "the acis - s data cover less than 3 full binary orbits so it is not clear whether this variability is truly periodic and stable over many orbits .",

    "as noted previously , several nearby msps in the field of the galaxy @xcite and most msps in the globular cluster 47 tuc @xcite appear to be predominantly soft , thermal x - ray sources due to their hot polar caps .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite ( see in particular their figure 1 ) , the ( nearly ) antipodal geometry of the polar caps and the effects of light bending guarantee that this surface emission is observed for any combination of magnetic inclinations and viewing angles .",
    "in addition , the difference in observed luminosity between the most and least favorable geometric orientations ( always face - on versus always edge - on hot spots ) is only a factor of @xmath13 as a consequence of gravitational bending of light near the neutron star surface .",
    "thus , thermal msps should be observable in x - rays even if they can not be seen in the radio due to unfavorable beaming and fall within a relatively narrow range of x - ray luminosities .",
    "the limiting sensitivity of the available acis - s data is @xmath1@xmath93 ergs s@xmath16 , meaning that typical thermal msps ( with luminosities of a few @xmath28 ergs s@xmath16 ) would be detected in the combined _ chandra _ acis - s observations if they were located in ngc 6397 , even in the unlikely event that their two hot spots are always seen edge - on .",

    "therefore , when the shock is occulted at @xmath117 ( either partially or totally ) , the soft thermal radiation from the msp surface provides a larger contribution to the total x - ray emission , resulting in a softening of the observed spectrum . in principle",
    ", detailed orbital - phase - resolved x - ray observations would permit disentanglement of the thermal polar cap emission and the non - thermal shock emission .",
    "note that the moderate spin - down luminosity of @xmath119 ergs s@xmath16 @xcite does not favor a magnetospheric origin of the observed non - thermal x - rays considering that most other msps with comparable values of @xmath120 exhibit much softer , predominantly thermal spectra ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , for pulsed non - thermal emission , it is difficult to explain the observed variations in the total flux and the softening of the spectrum at @xmath117 .      the x - ray and optical properties of u18",
    "are consistent with those of a binary containing a rotation - powered pulsar wind interacting with material from the secondary star .",
    "it is interesting to note the significantly larger luminosity compared to j17405340 and other interacting msp systems .",
    "this could indicate either a much larger shock region , an enhanced density of radiating particles , and/or a more energetic pulsar wind .",
    "if this binary does indeed harbor a msp , it may be difficult to detect at radio frequencies due to the large quantities of gas present within and around the binary .",
    "this gas may render the pulsar perpetually eclipsed at radio frequencies .",
    "thus , u18 may belong to the class of so - called `` hidden '' msps @xcite making a confirmation of its true nature quite difficult .",
    "the detection of pulsed x - ray emission from the pulsar itself may also be difficult due to the dominant x - ray flux from the intrabinary shock and the _ a priori _ unknown pulsar spin period .",
    "we note that , at present , we can not strictly rule out the possibility that u18 is a cataclysmic variable , such as an intermediate polar ( ip ) , instead of an msp .",
    "these objects also generally exhibit hard x - ray spectra and x - ray luminosities comparable to that of u18 .",
    "in addition , the ip ako9 in 47 tuc @xcite appears to have a `` red straggler '' or `` sub - subgiant '' companion as well . in order to unveil the true nature of the u18 system , further optical observations , optimized for variability study , are needed .",
    "the cadence of our _ hst _ acs / wfc optical dataset ( 10 single - orbit observations spaced @xmath11 month apart , see h.  cohn et al .  2009 , in preparation ) is not suitable for a reliable determination of the binary period of this system .",
    "the analysis in  5 suggests that ngc 6397 most likely harbors @xmath121 msps .",
    "it is of interest to compare these limits to the expected number of msps in this cluster , scaling by the stellar encounter rate ( @xmath63 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from other clusters with detected msps @xcite .",
    "@xcite integrate collision rates over king models out to the half - mass radius , finding a collision rate for ngc 6397 @xmath122 that of 47 tuc .",
    "other analyses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using a simpler formalism ( @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the central density and @xmath125 is the core radius of the cluster ) , find collision rates for ngc 6397 roughly @xmath126 that of 47 tuc .",
    "as 47 tuc has 23 known msps , and has been suggested to have a total of @xmath125 msps @xcite , the two approaches suggest either @xmath127 or @xmath12 msps should be present in ngc 6397 . comparisons with the number of msps in other clusters , such as terzan 5 @xcite give similar results . however , @xmath63 comparisons seem to underpredict the number of x - ray sources in ngc 6397 @xcite , indicating differences in the x - ray binary production processes in core - collapsed clusters such as ngc 6397 .",
    "for instance , @xcite has suggested that continuing globular cluster collapse means that the values of @xmath63 of king - model clusters during the epoch of x - ray binary formation were a factor of 3 smaller . in any case , the predicted numbers of msps in ngc 6397 from any of the above comparisons are generally in agreement with our estimate of @xmath121 msps in ngc 6397 .",
    "we have presented _ chandra x - ray observatory _ acis - s observations of the nearby core - collapsed globular cluster ngc 6397 .",
    "the depth of the available data has allowed interesting insight into the msp population of this cluster .",
    "for instance , it has provided a more complete multi - wavelength picture of the psr j17405340 binary .",
    "this peculiar system appears to exhibit predominantly non - thermal emission modulated at the orbital phase .",
    "given the pulsar energetics , the variable non - thermal x - ray emission is indicative of interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind and material from the companion , with evidence for an occultation of the resulting shock by the secondary star . ascertaining the detailed geometry of the intrabinary",
    "shock would require much more sensitive orbital - phase resolved spectroscopic x - ray and optical observations of this system than presently available .",
    "based on its x - ray and optical properties , u18 is a strong candidate for a msp , though one that may be perpetually eclipsed at radio frequencies . as noted by @xcite such msps may be relatively common both in globular clusters and in the field of galaxy .",
    "moreover , these sources may be mis - classified as lmxbs or cvs based on their x - ray to optical flux ratio alone ( see in particular * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further detailed multi - wavelength observations of psr j17405340 , u18 , and similar systems may reveal more information concerning the physics of the shock , which , may , in principle offer insight into the properties of msp winds , collisionless relativistic shocks , and particle acceleration mechanisms . moreover , this and similar msp binaries provide important clues about the behavior of accreting neutron stars transitioning to rotation power , which are believed to also contain an active radio pulsar and an overflowing companion @xcite .",
    "the deep x - ray observations of ngc 6397 supplemented by optical observations , also provide insight into the msp population of this cluster . specifically ,",
    "if the x - ray luminosity function of the ngc 6397 msp population resembles that of the galactic sample of msps , then this cluster contains no more than @xmath16 msps .",
    "this range of values is generally consistent with those inferred based on scaling of stellar encounter rates in globular clusters .",
