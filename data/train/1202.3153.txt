    "+ we find that an x - ray flux comparable with the _",
    "chandra  _ observed one can be produced via compton scattering off beamed synchrotron emission from a blazar - like emitting region by the relativistic electrons in a knot located at kpc scales .",
    "hence , in 3c  186 the relevance of the jet as a source of high - energy radiation seems intimately related to its dynamical structure . indeed , this does not rule out the possibility of a competing contribution of the disk - corona to the x - ray emission .",
    "we note that the estimates of the x - ray emission related to the accretion disk based on @xcite give @xmath207 erg s@xmath3 , similar to the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the detection of 3c  186 at @xmath4-ray energies would be decisive to discriminate the nature of its x - ray emission .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted flux of the model is more than 2 orders of magnitude below the detection limit of the _ fermi_-lat @xcite . in the framework of the structured jet , radio variability correlated to the observed x - ray one can be detected if it is caused by a change of the electron population of the mildly relativistic knot , but not if it is related to a variation of the blazar component .",
    "+ there are some interesting aspects related to the structured jet scenario considered here .",
    "dynamically , the jet has to decelerate on kpc scales .",
    "it requires an initial high jet kinetic power ( @xmath208 erg s@xmath3 ) , that is comparable with those estimated for the most powerful blazars . unless time dependent ,",
    "in which case one should expect to find sources where the kpc scale power exceeds that associated with the blazar component , the jet has to experience strong dissipation on kpc scales to account for the difference in the jet power estimated using the physical parameters of the two emitting regions .",
    "depending on the assumptions on the composition , the initial jet power could be up to two orders of magnitude larger than the disk luminosity .",
    "therefore , in such a case , the interactions , with the host - galaxy medium first and the cluster environment then , could be dominated by the jet .",
    "+ the study of 3c  186 is a pilot case for a broader investigation of radiation processes in young radio sources . in our future work",
    "we will extend the modeling presented here to other young radio sources observed in x - rays , in order to : a ) determine wether there is a consistent behavior with respect to the possible jet contribution ; b ) ascertain wether there are candidates suitable for detection in the @xmath4-ray band to definitely assess the origin of the high - energy emission in the early phases of the radio sources growth .",
