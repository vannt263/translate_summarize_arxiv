    "a _ biquandle _ is an algebraic structure consisting of a set @xmath0 with four binary operations @xmath1 and @xmath2 satisfying axioms derived from the oriented reidemeister moves , where generators of the algebra are identified with semi - arcs in an oriented link diagram .",

    "@xmath4 which satisfies some additional criteria corresponding to the first and second reidemeister moves .",
    "such a map @xmath5 is called a _ switch _ , and a biquandle is an invertible switch with components @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 and the extra conditions required by the reverse type ii and type i moves .",
    "@xmath8    this relationship between the biquandle axioms and the reidemeister moves makes biquandles a natural source of knot and link invariants .",
    "for example , the biquandle counting invariant @xmath9 is the cardinality of the set of biquandle homomorphisms from the knot biquandle of a link @xmath10 into a finite target biquandle @xmath11",
    ". one can think of each homomorphism as a `` coloring '' of the link diagram by @xmath11 , assigning an element of @xmath11 to every semiarc in a diagram of @xmath10 such that the biquandle operations are satisfied at every crossing ; we can then see that this family of invariants is a generalization of fox s @xmath12-coloring invariants .",

    "we generalize the symplectic quandle polynomial invariants defined in @xcite to the biquandle case and give some examples of classical and virtual links which have the same value for the biquandle counting invariant but are distinguished by the bilinear biquandle invariant . in section 5 , we list all bilinear biquandle structures with cardinality up to 27 as determined by our computer search . in section 6",
