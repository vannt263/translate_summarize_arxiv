    "<S> an analogous analysis holds for qlems .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the negativity versus global and marginal entropies shows that all the mapped two - qubit states lie in a quasi - bidimensional region [ see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath150 is almost perfectly a function of the global and marginal entropies alone . by superimposing the boundary curves corresponding to qlems and qmems to the numerical analysis in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the situation typical of the gaussian case is enhanced in the case of qubits , since in the latter the gap between maximal and minimal entanglement is even narrower . </S>",
    "<S> the introduced mode - qubit dynamical interface preserves the hierarchy of entangled states in the entropic space : gmems ( glems ) are mapped into qmems ( qlems ) . </S>",

    "<S> the qubit transition - energy can be set by an _ in situ _ magnetic flux that modulates the josephson energy so as to adjust the qubit - to - light coupling . </S>",
    "<S> each qubit is integrated in a full / half - wave waveguide split by input / output capacitances : we can thus consider two disconnected regions of a coplanar waveguide , joined via independent input / output capacitive lines for the injection / leakage of the field resource or via a large josephson junction . </S>",

    "<S> although the ability to experimentally engineer microwave - field states are inferior to their optical counterparts , squeezed - vacuum / thermal states have been produced by josephson parameteric amplifiers embodied by large junctions  @xcite , which is a very promising step towards the preparation of microwave states belonging to the classes studied here . our scheme may be used to entangle collections of remote matter - like qubits , so as to achieve key resources in quantum technology . </S>",
