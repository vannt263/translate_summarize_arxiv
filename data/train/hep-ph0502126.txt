    "recently several new models of low - scale gravity were proposed based on brane world ideas @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on phenomenology of the first of them , the add scenario with flat space - time geometry .",
    "we derive the lhc discovery potential to observe one of several new phenomena appearing in add .",
    "namely , we consider modification of the standard model dimuon continuum due to contributions from multiple virtual kk - modes of graviton .",
    "the add model @xcite implies that @xmath0 ( @xmath0=1 .. 6 ) extra spatial dimensions can exist in addition to our three compactified on a @xmath0-sphere with a radius @xmath1 ( the simlpest case ) .",
    "then @xmath1 is called the compactification radius and it does not have to be the planckian size , but can be really such a large as tenths of millimeter or smaller .",
    "usual consideration is that all of the standard model fields are confined on a three - brane embedded in a @xmath2-dimensional space referred as the bulk ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is the reason why we don not observe any effects from extra dimensions up to the energy scale @xmath3 when fundamental multidimensional structure can be distinguished . in this model graviton",
    "is only multidimensional field what can travel through the bulk . in the model",
    "the planckian scale @xmath4 is no longer fundamental but it becomes the effective scale connected with the true fundamental multidimensional scale @xmath5 in such a way :    @xmath6    so we can observe possible effects from multidimensional gravity at the energies above @xmath7 and if desired to be probed at the lhc the fundamental mass scale should be adjusted to the order of 1 or a few tev .",
    "the characteristic picture of add model is the existence of kaluza - klein modes of graviton ( these modes will be massive and the mass value is @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a mode number ) .",
    "these modes must be light : in dependence on a number of extra dimensions at the fundamental scale @xmath10 tev mass values for the first graviton excitation start from @xmath11 ev for @xmath12 up to maximal @xmath13 mev for @xmath14 .",
    "more details about of add phenomenology can be found , for example in @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath10 tev one can calculate extra dimensions radius @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 cm . the case @xmath18 gives unacceptably large values of @xmath1 because the newton law validity is established down to 0.2 mm @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath19 the radius value about 1 mm , the fundamental scale value @xmath10 tev is the most probably excluded by astrophysics and cosmological arguments ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the closest permissible value of @xmath20 for @xmath19 is about 30 tev that is obviously out of the scope of observations on modern and future accelerators .",
    "thus the most favorable set of parameters appears to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 tev and @xmath23 mm .    existing data analysis gave no positive results , but only constraints .",
    "lep experiments have closely investigated possibilities of presence of large extra dimensions .",
    "one of the evidences would be direct kk - graviton production in @xmath24 process .",
    "measurement of final states with photons and missing energy showed no deviation from the standard model predictions and put constraints on @xmath20  from 1.5 tev to 0.75 tev for a number of extra dimensions from two to five respectively @xcite .",
    "virtual graviton production at the lep was searched for in processes with pair - production of fermions and gauge bosons : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "none of the processes exhibited evidence for virtual graviton production and constraints established for @xmath20 are around 1.2 tev .",
    "tevatron experiments cdf and d0 having searched for final states with missing transverse energy in processes with photons in final state observed no signal .",
    "the cdf collaboration has also searched for events with one or two jets and large missing transverse energy @xcite .",
    "virtual graviton production might have been seen as a distortion of mass spectra and angular distributions of electron and muon pairs as well as diphotons in the final state .",
    "the largest experimental sensitivity was achieved by the combined analysis of electron pairs and the diphoton channels performed by the d0 collaboration at run i and run ii .",
    "the data agree with the sm predictions for drell - yan electron - pair production , direct diphoton production and an instrumental background .",
    "the current lower limit on @xmath20 derived at tevatron are around 1.1 tev @xcite .",
    "in the section above we have pointed out that the characteristic feature of add is the existence of light kk - gravitons which could be directly produced at colliders ( real graviton production ) or observed through contact interactions as virtual kk - graviton exchange .",
    "experimental signals for add scenario might be found in dijet , dilepton , diphoton mass spectra and missing energy distributions .",
    "the missing energy phenomenon corresponds to real graviton production , whereas the first three signals account for virtual graviton production .",
    "real gravitons carry away a fraction of the total energy produced in a hard collision , in other words induce energy leakage from the interaction point .",
    "virtual gravitons make contribution to the sm diagrams for drell - yan processes as well as for gamma pair production which results in significant modification of these spectra .",
    "an amplitude of each separate graviton contribution is suppressed by @xmath32 , however the production cross section counts many contributions ( large number of gravitons with the same mass value defined by a mode number @xmath9 , see above , is taken into account with a state density @xmath33 ) and this circumstance induces crucial enhancement of graviton production cross section so effective suppression will be only by @xmath34 .",
    "the cross section of drell - yan process with kaluza - klein terms can be factorized as : @xmath35 where the first and the third terms correspond to the sm and kaluza - klein contributions respectively , while the second one characterizes an interference between the sm and gravity . here",
    "@xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the center - of - mass energy .",
    "exact expressions for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be found at @xcite .",
    "the characteristic scale value @xmath5 with a number of extra dimensions @xmath0 pinpoint the region of dilepton invariant masses @xmath42 sensitive to extra dimensions . the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] demonstrates the invariant mass distributions of muon pairs for the pure standard model ( lower curve ) and for scenarios with @xmath0 = 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 extra dimensions .",
    "cases with four different values of @xmath5 ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 tev ) were considered .",
    "those differential cross sections , @xmath43 , were obtained following @xcite taking into account the next - leading - order qcd corrections ( using the @xmath44 factor of 1.38 ) .    in order to estimate the lhc sensitivity to new physics coming from extra dimensions in our analysis we used typical kinematics and geometrical acceptance of one of the lhc experiments , cms , which is , as with atlas , expected to be able to trigger and identify hard muons with a transverse momentum up to several tev .",
    "the dimuon is accepted when both decay muons are within detector system covering the pseudorapidity region of @xmath45@xmath46@xmath45 @xmath47 2.4 .",
    "in addition , the cut @xmath48 gev / c was applied on each muon .",
    "no cuts were made on isolation of muons in the tracker and the calorimeter .",
    "the total efficiency dimuon selection , @xmath49 , is about @xmath50 @xmath51 . to take into account a detector resolution of a muon momentum",
    "the parametrization @xmath52 was used .",
    "the expected significance was computed by method based on counting signal and background events in a certain signal region .",
    "the estimator @xmath53 @xcite where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the number of signal and background events in the invariant mass interval above 1 tev was used for this purpose .",
    "the add model discovery limit as a function of the @xmath5 scale is shown on the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . filled area between two curves ( @xmath0 = 3 and @xmath0 = 6 ) shows the upper limit on @xmath5 for different numbers of extra dimensions with a 5@xmath56 significance .",
    "as it may be seen , the scale @xmath57 tev can be reached at integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath58 even for the most unfavorable case with @xmath0 = 6 . for more promising scenario where the number of extra dimensions is minimal ( @xmath0 = 3 ) the accessible level is extended up to 7.5 tev .    note",
    "that these estimates are very close to earlier results @xcite which were obtained having used the maximum likelyhood method and bayesian approach . in this",
    "cases the lhc limit extracted from combined dielectron and dimuon analysis is about 6.9 @xmath59 10.2 tev for @xmath0 = 6 @xmath59 2 .",
    "generally , the detector performances for electron and muon measurements are widely different and muon and electron modes should be analized separetely .",
    "as it was discussed above , the physics beyond the standard model can manifest itself as deviations from the standard behavior of drell - yan spectra . at that",
    ", these distortions may be both positive and negative , in other words a dilepton continuum can rise like in the add scenario considered above or equally well fall dawn in dependence on a theoretical scenario ( for instance , in scenario with non - commutative extra dimensions  see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . and what is more , a region of dilepton invariant masses where these effects are occurred is not fixed by a mass window .",
    "it can be more or less narrow resonance state above the dilepton continuum ( like in the rs1 scenario @xcite or extended gauge models @xcite ) , or just the smooth enough up(down)ward dimuon distribution slope in a wide invariant mass interval .",
    "for correct extraction of signal events from a background we should understand reliability of calculations of a dilepton spectrum within the standard model to keep under control all possible sources of errors and systematic uncertainties .",
    "this systematics can be related to an accuracy of theoretical calculations , an accuracy of phenomenological determination of pdf s and a roughness of experimental data  detector resolution , goodness of fits etc .",
    "a possible theoretical ambiguity in such studies is induced by incomplete accounting of contributions from qcd and electroweak higher order quantum corrections to processes considered . as it was mentioned before current calculations were done in the leading order for the cteq6 with @xmath44-factor of 1.38 which was used to take into account next - to - leading - order contributions .",
    "it is expected here that a total value of additional nnlo contributions does not exceed 5  % .",
    "a phenomenological origin of pdf gives one another systematic error .",
    "first of all , estimations of a cross section obtained by using different sets of structure functions are not quite equal .",
    "these results are varying within @xmath60  % for @xmath61 1 tev .",
    "in addition , there are uncertainties within the bounds of the same set ( so called _ internal _ uncertainties ) coming from an accuracy of the global analysis of experimental data and from experimental measurement errors .",
    "a recently developed pdf building technique goes beyond the `` standard '' paradigm of extracting of only one `` best fit '' .",
    "last versions of pdf contain a set of various alternative fits obtained by subjective tuning of specific degrees of freedom for this pdf @xcite .",
    "applying standard statistical methods one can analyze internal uncertainties comprehensively .",
    "these uncertainties are increasing crucially for very large values of @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) and in the small-@xmath62 region .",
    "for instance , uncertainty bands for cteq6 m set of pdf s are stayed to be about of 2.6  % ( 6  % ) for @xmath64(@xmath65)-quarks respectively in the region of @xmath62 values from @xmath66 up to 0.3 at @xmath63 = 10 @xmath67 , and these uncertainties grow rapidly for the large @xmath62 up to of 100 % at @xmath62=@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "course , an ambiguity in theoretical calculations of the drell - yan cross section due to _ internal _ uncertainties of pdf can also turn out to be very large .",
    "thus for invariant masses available to data from the tevatron ( @xmath69 tev ) this uncertainty is order to theoretical one and does not exceed @xmath70 % , but an error will increase strongly for large values of invariant masses up to @xmath71 % for 3 tev ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , pdf related incorrectness of calculations can reduce significantly a possibility to derive add signals .",
    "for example , their counting decreases of the fundamental mass scale reachable at lhc from 7.5 tev ( for @xmath0=3 ) down to 6.5 tev .",
    "it should be noted that around the region ( near 2.5 tev ) the error coming from pdf s is order to statistical one which is estimated for integrated luminosity of 300 @xmath58 ( about three years of lhc operation in the high - luminosity regime ) .",
    "today , the current analysis of pdf sets shows that pdf uncertainties contribute significantly in drell - yan calculation ambiguity .",
    "one expect , that new data from both working machines , the tevatron and hera , and especially from the lhc in future will extend an available for analysis range of @xmath62 and @xmath63 and will allow to extract parton distribution functions more precisely .",
    "moreover , a definite progress is also being expected from the theoretical side that will be induced by precise counting both higher twist terms and nonperturbative qcd effects @xcite .",

    "we are very grateful to g.  landsberg to provide us the add generator code .",
