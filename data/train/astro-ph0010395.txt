    "the issue of whether or not the primordial fluctuations are gaussian is of fundamental importance in theories of structure formation .",
    "gaussian large - scale primordial fluctuations are believed to be the hallmark of the simplest inflationary scenarios . in these theories",
    "vacuum quantum fluctuation , with gaussian statistics , are stretched by a period of exponential expansion to give rise to the large scale fluctuations we observe today .",
    "in contrast , topological defect theories , which are also possible candidates for structure formation @xcite , are believed to produce non - gaussian density fields .",
    "non - gaussianity is also believed to be associated with some non - minimal inflationary models @xcite , such as those generating isocurvature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "several recent @xcite papers have shown indications of non - gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations , as measured by the cobe - dmr experiment .",
    "the first of these detections + @xcite was later found to be due to an experimental systematic @xcite , and the second @xcite to an error of method @xcite .",
    "the third claim @xcite , however , remains unassailable . in that work a bispectrum analysis was carried out , using adjacent scales @xmath1 as components of the bispectrum .",
    "a significant deviation from gaussianity was found , with a high confidence level .",
    "an obvious question is whether this non - gaussianity extends to components correlating scales with a larger separation , say @xmath2 , with @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question .",
    "as we shall see the non - gaussian signal found in @xcite does not appear to extend to larger separations @xmath3 .",
    "in this letter we examine the possibility of deviations from gaussianity in terms of the bispectrum , which should be zero for a gaussian process .",
    "let us expand the temperature fluctuations @xmath4 in spherical harmonic functions : @xmath5 a gaussian probability distribution function is completely described by the first two moments , @xmath6 and @xmath7 i.e. all higher moments can be obtained from the mean value and the variance .",
    "this does not hold for non - gaussian functions .",
    "the bispectrum , a rotationally invariant cubic form associated with the third moment , @xmath8 , is therefore a possible test of gaussianity .",
    "it is given by @xmath9 where the @xmath10 is the wigner @xmath11 symbol .",
    "in @xcite correlations between multipoles separated by @xmath12 , @xmath13 were investigated . in this letter",
    "we complete this work by using the other possible separations , @xmath14 , which fit within the signal dominated range of @xmath15 probed by the cobe - dmr experiment .",
    "selection rules require @xmath16 to be even , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . from these constraints",
    "we see that a suitable chain of correlators is @xmath19 , with @xmath15 even .",
    "we then follow precisely the same procedure documented in @xcite and @xcite , apart from considering the more general ratio @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity is dimensionless , and is invariant under rotations and parity .",
    "the same data is examined ; the inverse noise - variance - weighted average maps of the 53a,53b,90a and 90b _ cobe_-dmr channels , with monopole and dipole removed , at resolution 6 , in galactic and ecliptic pixelization .",
    "we use the extended galactic cut of @xcite , and @xcite to remove most of the emission from the plane of the galaxy . to estimate the @xmath22s we set the value of the pixels within the galactic cut to 0 and the monopole and dipole of the cut map to zero .",
    "we then integrate the map multiplied with spherical harmonics to obtain the estimates of the @xmath23s and apply equations [ bispec ] and [ defi ] .",
    "the observed @xmath22s are to be compared with their distributions @xmath24 as inferred from monte carlo simulations in which gaussian maps are subject to dmr noise and galactic cut . in simulating dmr noise",
    "we take into account the full noise covariance matrix , as described in @xcite .",
    "this includes correlations between pixels @xmath25 degrees apart .",
    "the comparison between @xmath24 and the observed @xmath22 for various @xmath26 is displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] -  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the observed values agree well with the probability distributions from the monte carlo distributions : implying that as far as @xmath27 bispectrum components are concerned the data supports gaussianity .",
    "to quantify just how well the observations agree with gaussianity , we do a goodness of fit statistic on the data .",
    "we calculate the @xmath28 value for the different @xmath15 separations , and compare with the respective distributions @xmath29 .",
    "the rationale behind considering separate @xmath28 was explained in @xcite , and for the distributions @xmath30 found ( which are very close to gaussians ) it makes sense to use the standard @xmath28 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of different observables and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the expectation value and the variance of the @xmath35th observable respectively .",
    "this reduces to the expression proposed in @xcite in our case .",
    "the @xmath29 are then calculated through further monte carlo simulations , so that possible correlations between the different @xmath15 may be taken into account .",
    "the @xmath28 distributions and corresponding observed values are shown in fig  [ fig5 ] .    as we can see @xmath36 for all separations @xmath0 , with deviations well within the spread expected from @xmath29 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the results obtained for @xmath37 , that is bispectrum components measuring correlations between adjacent modes . for these @xmath38 , meaning that the observed @xmath39 do not display the scatter around zero expected from a gaussian distribution .",
    "we now found that this distinctive non - gaussian signal does not extend to bispectrum components with @xmath27 .",
    "the implication seems to be that the inter - mode correlations suggested by the findings of @xcite fall off quickly with the scale separation , something which conforms to theoretical prejudice .    in a recent paper @xcite a variety of components of the bispectrum",
    "was studied in the context of a semi - analytical texture model .",
    "such a model is at the very least oversimplified , and probably has little to do with real - life textures . in any case",
    "that work stresses the importance of analysing off - diagonal components , as we have done in this paper .",
