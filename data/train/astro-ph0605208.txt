    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are brief events occurring at an average rate of a few per day throughout the universe , which for a brief period of seconds completely flood with their radiation an otherwise almost dark gamma - ray sky . while they are on , they outshine every other source of gamma - rays in the sky , including the sun .",
    "in fact , they are the most concentrated and brightest electromagnetic explosions in the universe . until recently , they were undetected at any wavelengths other than gamma - rays , which provided poor directional information and hence no direct clues about their site of origin .",
    "this changed in early 1997 when the beppo - sax satellite succeeded in detecting them in x - rays , which after a delay of some hours yielded sufficiently accurate positions for large ground - based telescope follow - up observations .",
    "these proved that they were at cosmological distances , comparable to those of the most distant galaxies and quasars known in the universe . since even at these extreme distances",
    "( up to gigaparsecs , or @xmath0 cm ) they outshine galaxies and quasars by a very large factor , albeit briefly , their energy needs must be far greater .",
    "their electromagnetic energy output during tens of seconds is comparable to that of the sun over @xmath1 years , the approximate age of the universe , or to that of our entire milky way over a few years .",
    "the current interpretation of how this prodigious energy release is produced is that a correspondingly large amount of gravitational energy ( roughly a solar rest mass ) is released in a very short time ( seconds or less ) in a very small region ( tens of kilometers or so ) by a cataclysmic stellar event ( the collapse of the core of a massive star , or the subsequent mergers of two remnant compact cores ) .",
    "most of the energy would escape in the first few seconds as thermal neutrinos , while another substantial fraction may be emitted as gravitational waves .",
    "this sudden energy liberation would result in a very high temperature fireball expanding at highly relativistic speeds , which undergoes internal dissipation leading to gamma - rays , and it would later develop into a blast wave as it decelerates against the external medium , producing an afterglow which gets progressively weaker .",
    "the resulting electromagnetic energy emitted appears to be of the order of a percent or less of the total energy output , but even this photon output ( in @xmath2-rays ) is comparable to the total kinetic energy output leading to optical photons by a supernova over weeks .",
    "the remarkable thing about this theoretical scenario is that it successfully predicts many of the observed properties of the bursts .",
    "this fireball shock scenario and the blast wave model of the ensuing afterglow have been extensively tested against observations , and have become the leading paradigms for the current understanding of grb .",
    "historically , grbs were first discovered in 1967 by the vela satellites , although they were not publicly announced until 1973 @xcite .",
    "these spacecraft , carrying omnidirectional gamma - ray detectors , were flown by the u.s .",
    "department of defense to monitor for nuclear explosions which might violate the nuclear test ban treaty . when these mysterious gamma - ray flashes were first detected , and it was determined that they did not come from the earth s direction , the first suspicion ( quickly abandoned ) was that they might be the product of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization .",
    "soon , however , it was realized that this was a new and extremely puzzling cosmic phenomenon @xcite . for the next 25 years , only these brief gamma - ray flashes",
    "were observed , which could be only roughly localized , and which vanished too soon , leaving no traces , or so it seemed .",
    "gamma - rays are notoriously hard to focus , so no sharp gamma - ray  images \" exist to this day : they are just diffuse pin - pricks of gamma - ray light .",
    "this mysterious phenomenon led to a huge interest and to numerous conferences and publications on the subject , as well as to a proliferation of theories .",
    "in one famous review article at the 1975 texas symposium on relativistic astrophysics , no fewer than 100 different possible theoretical models of grb were listed @xcite , most of which could not be ruled out by the observations then available .    the first significant steps in understanding grbs started with the 1991 launch of the compton gamma - ray observatory , whose results were summarized in @xcite .",
    "the all - sky survey from the batse instrument showed that bursts were isotropically distributed , strongly suggesting a cosmological , or possibly an extended galactic halo distribution , with essentially zero dipole and quadrupole components @xcite . at cosmological distances",
    "the observed grb fluxes imply enormous energies , which , from the fast time variability , must arise in a small volume in a very short time .",
    "this must lead to the formation of an @xmath3 fireball @xcite , which will expand relativistically .",
    "the main difficulty with this scenario was that a smoothly expanding fireball would convert most of its energy into kinetic energy of accelerated baryons ( rather than into photon energy ) , and would produce a quasi - thermal spectrum , while the typical timescales would not explain events much longer than milliseconds .",
    "this difficulty was addressed by the  fireball shock scenario \" @xcite , based on the realization that shocks are likely to arise , e.g. when the fireball ejecta runs into the external medium , after the fireball has become optically thin , thus reconverting the expansion kinetic energy into non - thermal radiation .",
    "the complicated light curves can also be understood , e.g. in terms of internal shocks @xcite in the outflow itself , before it runs into the external medium , caused by velocity variations in the outflow from the source .",
    "the next major developments came after 1997 , when the italian - dutch satellite beppo - sax succeeded in detecting fading x - ray images which , after a delay of 4 - 6 hours for processing , led to positions @xcite , allowing follow - ups at optical and other wavelengths , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this paved the way for the measurement of redshift distances , the identification of candidate host galaxies , and the confirmation that they were indeed at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the detection of other grb afterglows followed in rapid succession , sometimes extending to radio @xcite and over timescales of many months @xcite , and in a number of cases resulted in the identification of candidate host galaxies , e.g. @xcite , etc .",
    "the study of afterglows has provided strong confirmation for the generic fireball shock model of grb .",
    "this model led to a correct prediction @xcite , in advance of the observations , of the quantitative nature of afterglows at wavelengths longer than @xmath2-rays , which were in substantial agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "a consolidation of the progress made by beppo - sax was made possible through the hete-2 satellite @xcite , after the demise of cgro and beppo - sax .",
    "it provided a continuing stream of comparable quality afterglow positions , after typical delays of hours , and contributed to the characterization of a new class of sources called x - ray flashes or xrf @xcite resembling softer grbs , which had been earlier identified with beppo - sax .",
    "it also localized grb 030329 , which resulted in the first unambiguous association with a supernova ( sn2003dh ) @xcite .",
    "the third wave of significant advances in the field is due to the swift multi - wavelength afterglow satellite , launched in november 2004 , which achieved the long - awaited goal of accurately localized afterglows starting a minute or so after the burst trigger , at gamma - ray , x - ray and optical wavelenghts @xcite .",
    "this revealed the hitherto unexplored afterglow behavior between minutes to hours , enabling a study of the transition from the prompt emission and the subsequent long term afterglow , and revealing a rich range of x - ray early behavior .",
    "it also achieved the long - awaited discovery of the afterglows of  short \" gamma - ray bursts ( whose hard gamma - ray emission is briefer than 2 s ) .",
    "it furthermore broke through the symbolic redshift @xmath4 barrier , beyond which very few objects of any kind have been measured .    on the theoretical side , a major issue raised by the large redshifts , e.g. @xcite ,",
    "is that the measured @xmath2-ray fluences ( the flux integrated over time ) imply a total energy of order a solar rest mass , @xmath5 ergs , if it is emitted isotropically .",
    "by contrast , the total radiant ( and the associated kinetic expansion energy ) of supernovae ( sn ) , which is detected over timescales of weeks to months , is of the order of a thousandth of a solar rest mass , @xmath6 ergs .",
    "a grb emission which is concentrated in a jet , rather than isotropically , alleviates significantly the energy requirements .",
    "there is now extensive observational evidence for such collimated emission from grbs , provided by breaks in the optical / ir light curves of their afterglows @xcite .",
    "the inferred total amount of radiant and kinetic energy involved in the explosion is in this case comparable to that of supernovae ( except that in grbs the energy is mostly emitted in a jet in @xmath2-rays over tens of seconds , whereas in supernovae it is emitted isotropically in the optical over weeks ) .",
    "while the luminous ( electromagnetic ) energy output of a grb is thus  only \" of the same order of magnitude as that of supernovae , the explosion is much more concentrated , both in time and in direction , so its specific brightness for an observer aligned with the jet is many orders of magnitude more intense , and appears at much higher characteristic photon energies . including the collimation correction , the grb electromagnetic emission is energetically quite compatible with an origin in , say , either compact mergers of neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) or black hole - neutron star ( bh - ns ) binaries @xcite , or with a core collapse ( hypernova or collapsar ) model of a massive stellar progenitor @xcite , which would be related to but much rarer than core - collapse supernovae .",
    "while in both cases the outcome could be , at least temporarily , a massive fast - rotating ultra - high magnetic field neutron star ( a magnetar ) , the high mass involved is expected to lead inevitably to the formation of a central black hole , fed through a brief accretion episode from the surrounding disrupted core stellar matter , which provides the energy source for the ejection of relativistic matter responsible for the radiation .",
    "a stellar origin of grb leads to two predictions which are similar to those for core - collapse supernovae , albeit in so far unobserved aspects . in both grb ( whether from compact mergers or from collapsar scenarios ) and in core - collapse sn , the central material is compressed to nuclear densities and heated to virial temperatures characteristically in the multi - mev range , leading to 5 - 30 mev thermal neutrinos . and in both cases , the merging or collapsing core material acquires a time - varying quadrupole mass moment ( which may be smaller in sn not related to grb ) , which leads to gravitational wave emission . in both grb and supernovae , the total neutrino emission is of the order of a fraction of a solar rest mass , @xmath7 ergs .",
    "the gravitational wave emission is of the same order for compact mergers , probably less than that for collapsars , and much less in normal core collapse sne .",
    "experiments currently planned or under construction will be able to probe these new channels .",
    "before reviewing , in the next section , the latest observational advances achieved with swift , the observational progress made up to that time is briefly surveyed .",
    "more extensive discussion and references on observations previous to 2004 are , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-ray phenomenology of grb was extensively studied and characterized by the batse instrument on the compton gro satellite @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-ray spectra are non - thermal , typically fitted in the mev range by broken power - laws whose energy per decade peak is in the range 50 - 500 kev @xcite , sometimes extending to gev energies @xcite .",
    "grb appeared to leave no detectable traces at other wavelengths , except in some cases briefly in x - rays .",
    "the gamma - ray durations range from @xmath8 s to about @xmath9 s , with a roughly bimodal distribution of long bursts of @xmath10 s and short bursts of @xmath11s @xcite , and substructure sometimes down to milliseconds .",
    "the gamma - ray light curves range from smooth , fast - rise and quasi - exponential decay ( freds ) , through curves with several peaks , to highly variable curves with many peaks @xcite ( figure [ fig : grblc ] ) .",
    "the pulse distribution is complex @xcite , and the time histories can provide clues for the geometry of the emitting regions @xcite .",
    "grb were conclusively shown to be at cosmological distances following beppo - sax localizations of their x - ray afterglows in 1997 @xcite , followed by optical host galaxy identification and redshift determinations @xcite .",
    "the afterglows decay as a power law in time in a manner predicted by pre - existing models @xcite , softening in time from x - rays to optical to radio ( e.g. figure [ fig:970228lc ] ) .",
    "the energy needed to explain the total ( mainly gamma - ray ) energy fluence can be as large as @xmath12 ergs , where @xmath13 is the solid angle into which the gamma - rays are beamed .",
    "this is for the highest fluences seen in some of the most distant bursts , although for many bursts the energy budget problem is not as extreme .",
    "if the emission is assumed to be emitted isotropic ( isotropic equivalent luminosity or energy ) this energy ranges up to a solar rest mass in gamma - rays .",
    "this would strain a stellar origin interpretation , since from basic principles and experience it is known that , even for the most efficient radiation conversion schemes , a dominant fraction of the energy should escape in the form of thermal neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "the energy requirements , however , are much less severe in the case when the emission is collimated (  [ sec : jetobs ] ) .",
    "grb afterglow light curves such as those shown in figure [ fig:970228lc ] have been followed up starting several hours after the trigger in x - rays by beppo - sax and subsequently hete-2 , and in the optical / ir from ground - based telescopes ( or in some case with hst ) , and have been explained in terms of forward shock emission ( for discussions of the pre - swift data interpretation see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "afterglows have been followed up at radio wavelengths in some cases over months , and the analysis and interpretation of the radio spectra and light curves @xcite provides important clues for the calorimetry and the multi - waveband model fits discussed in  [ sec : standardag ] .",
    "there is now strong observational evidence @xcite that grb result from a small fraction ( @xmath14 ) of stars which undergo a catastrophic energy release event toward the end of their evolution . for the class of long grb the candidates are massive stars whose core collapses @xcite to a black hole , either directly or after a brief accretion episode , possibly in the course of merging with a companion .",
    "this scenario is referred to as the collapsar or hypernova scenario , which received strong support through the secure spectroscopic detection in some cases of an associated supernova event ( e.g. @xcite ; see also   [ sec : snobs ] , [ sec : sn ] ) . for short bursts the most",
    "widely speculated candidates are mergers of neutron star ( ns ) binaries or neutron star - black hole ( bh ) binaries @xcite , which lose orbital angular momentum by gravitational wave radiation and undergo a merger .",
    "this second progenitor scenario has only now begun to be tested thanks to the swift detection of short burst afterglows ( see  [ sec : swift ] ,  [ sec : short ] ) .",
    "both of these progenitor types are expected to have as an end result the formation of a few solar mass black hole , surrounded by a temporary debris torus whose accretion can provide a sudden release of gravitational energy , sufficient to power a burst .",
    "an important point is that the overall energetics from these various progenitors need not differ by more than about one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the duration of the burst in this model is related to the fall - back time of matter to form an accretion torus around the bh @xcite or the accretion time of the torus @xcite .",
    "other related scenarios include the formation from a stellar collapse of a fast - rotating ultra - high magnetic field neutron star @xcite .",
    "an important subsequent development was the observation , in many of the well - sampled afterglows , of a break or steepening of the x - ray and optical light curves @xcite , which can be interpreted as being due to the outflow being jet - like and the break occurs when the edge of the jet becomes visible , as the jet slows down @xcite .",
    "the typical ( long burst ) inferred jet opening angles are @xmath15 degrees , which reduces the total energy requirements from @xmath16 erg to @xmath17 ergs @xcite , with a dispersion of a factor @xmath18 .",
    "the details are dependent on assumptions about the jet geometry , and whether one addresses the gamma - ray energy @xcite or the jet kinetic energy @xcite , with a somewhat larger dispersion in the latter .",
    "variable optical linear polarization is expected at the time of a jet break @xcite , which can provide additional constraints , also on the jet structure .",
    "light curve break determinations continued through the beppo - sax and hete-2 afterglow observation periods , mainly in the optical .",
    "break observations in the swift era are discussed in  [ sec : jet ] .",
    "prompt optical flashes ( starting within tens of seconds after the gamma - ray trigger ) have been reported from ground - based small robotic telescopes in a few bursts @xcite .",
    "these arise much earlier , are initially brighter and decay more steeply than more ubiquitous long - term , slow decaying optical afterglows generally detected since 1997 .",
    "they are also rare : between 1999 and 2004 there were only a handful of prompt optical flashes detected with robotic ground telescopes @xcite . since the swift launch , more than twenty prompt uvot ( or ground - based robotic ) optical flashes have been seen , mostly at times starting several hundreds of seconds after the trigger .",
    "none have been as bright as the first one detected in grb 990123 , except for the notable most distant grb 050904 , whose optical brightness is comparable to that of grb 990123 @xcite .",
    "this is discussed further in  [ sec : promptopt ] .",
    "at least some long grbs are associated with supernova explosions .",
    "the first reported example was the grb980425/sn1998bw association@xcite .",
    "sn 1998bw was a peculiar , energetic type ib / c supernova . using it as a template , other possible associations",
    "have been claimed through identifying a so - called red supernova bump on the optical afterglow light curves of grb 980326@xcite , grb 970228@xcite , grb 000911@xcite , grb 991208@xcite , grb 990712@xcite , grb 011121@xcite , grb 020405@xcite and grb 031203 @xcite . the first unambiguous supernova signature ( sn 2003dh )",
    "was detected in the @xmath19 grb 030329 , firmly establishing the grb - sn associations@xcite .",
    "another grb / sn event , grb060218/sn2006aj , is discussed in  [ sec : swift ] , and the supernova connection is discussed further in  [ sec : sn ] .",
    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are a class of bursts whose light curves and spectra resemble typical grb , except for the fact that their spectra are much softer , their spectral peaks @xmath20 being typically tens of kev or less @xcite .",
    "xrfs were first identified with the beppo - sax satellite , and have been studied in greater detail and numbers with the hete-2 satellite @xcite .",
    "their fluxes and isotropic equivalent luminosities tend to be smaller than for grb , which makes afterglow searches more difficult .",
    "nonetheless , several afterglows have been detected , and redshifts have been measured in some of them ( @xcite , also   [ sec : swift ] , [ sec : newag ] ) .",
    "the collimation - corrected total burst energy clustering around @xmath6 ergs , while making a stellar origin quite plausible , is unfortunately not sufficiently well defined to use as standard luminosity candles , whose apparent brightness would provide a distance determination .",
    "there are other possible distance measures , based on empirical correlations between burst observables .",
    "one of these is an apparent gamma - ray light curve variability correlation with the isotropic equivalent luminosity @xcite .",
    "another is the time lag ( between higher energy versus lower energy ) gamma - rays and the isotropic luminosity @xcite .",
    "attempts at modeling the spectral lags have relied on observer - angle dependences of the doppler boost @xcite . in these correlations the isotropic equivalent luminosity was used , in the absence of jet signatures , and they must be considered tentative for now . however ,",
    "if confirmed , they could be invaluable for independently estimating grb redshifts .",
    "a third one is a correlation between the spectral properties and the isotropic luminosity @xcite .",
    "these measures can be effectively calibrated only for light curves or spectra obtained with the same instrument and when redshifts are available . for the above methods",
    "the calibration set consists typically of a dozen bursts , which is insufficient for being considered reliable .",
    "the data set is now rapidly increasing with new swift redshift determinations , but the swift spectra are less well constrained at energies above 150 kev than with beppo - sax .    in recent years , attention has been drawn to a correlation between the photon spectral peak energy @xmath20 and the apparent isotropic energy @xmath21 , or the isotropic luminosity @xmath22 @xcite of the form @xmath23 .",
    "for grb , this correlation has been calibrated on a sample consisting of around ten bursts . while strongly suggestive , the sample is relatively small and the dispersion is large , so its usefulness as a distance measure is precarious .",
    "another suggestive result is that for some x - ray flashes whose redshift has been measured the correlation continues to hold @xcite , even though the peak energy is @xmath24 and the @xmath21 is @xmath25 orders of magnitude lower than for grb .",
    "an interesting development of the @xmath26 correlation is the proposal of a relationship between the collimation - corrected total energy ( @xmath27 and the photon spectral peak .",
    "modeling the jet break under the assumption that the jet expands into a uniform density external medium , this has the form @xmath28 for a jet assumed to propagate in a homogeneous medium @xcite , and the relation appears to be tighter than the previously discussed @xmath23 ( amati ) relation .",
    "this requires for calibration both an observed redshift and a light curve break . if it holds up for a larger calibration sample than the current ( @xmath29 18 bursts so far ) , it could be of promise as a cosmological tool @xcite .",
    "there are however problems to resolve before this becomes competitive with snia as a cosmological tool @xcite .",
    "the main ones are the presence of outliers @xcite , the lack of a large low redshift sample for calibration ( since using a high redshift sample requires assumptions about the cosmology which it is supposed to test ) , an evaluation of observational biases and selection effects , and the dependence of the results on model assumptions about the external medium and jet properties .",
    "the latter may be circumvented by relying only on observables , e.g. @xmath30 , fluence ( or peak flux ) and the break time @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the dispersion , however , remains so far about 1.5 - 2 times larger than for snia .",
    "compared to previous missions , the swift results represent a significant advance on two main accounts .",
    "first , the sensitivity of the burst alert detector ( bat , in the range 20 - 150 kev ) is somewhat higher than that of the corresponding instruments in cgro - batse , bepposax and hete-2 @xcite .",
    "second , swift can slew in less then 100 seconds in the direction determined by the bat instrument , positioning its much higher angular resolution x - ray ( xrt ) and uv - optical ( uvot ) detectors on the burst @xcite    as of december 2005 , at an average rate of 2 bursts detected per week , over 100 bursts had been detected by bat in about a year ( compared to 300/year by batse ; note the bat field of view is 2 sr , versus @xmath32 in batse ) . of these @xmath33 bursts ,",
    "90% were detected and followed with the xrt within @xmath34 s from the trigger , and about half within 100 s @xcite , while @xmath35 were detected also with the uvot @xcite . of the total , over 23 resulted in redshift determinations . included in this total sum",
    "are nine short grb , of which five had detected x - ray afterglows , three had optical , and one had a radio afterglow , with five host galaxy detections and redshift determinations .",
    "these were the first ever short grb afterglows detected and followed .",
    "the new observations bring the total redshift determinations to over 50 since 1997 , when bepposax enabled the first one .",
    "the median redshift of the swift bursts is @xmath36 , which is a factor @xmath37 higher than the median of the bepposax and hete-2 redshifts @xcite .",
    "this is a statistically significant difference between the beppo - sax and swift redshift samples @xcite .",
    "this may in part be ascribed to the better sensitivity of the bat detector , but mostly to the prompt and accurate positions from xrt and uvot , making possible ground - based detection at a stage when the afterglow is much brighter , by a larger number of robotic and other telescopes . as of january 2006",
    "the highest swift - enabled redshift is that of grb 050904 , obtained with the subaru telescope , @xmath38 @xcite , and the second highest is grb 050814 at @xmath39 , whereas the previous beppo - sax era record was @xmath40 .",
    "the relative paucity of uvot detections versus xrt detections may be ascribed in part to this higher median redshift , and in part to the higher dust extinction at the implied shorter rest - frame wavelenghts for a given observed frequency @xcite , although additional effects may be at work too .    in some of the bursts , both of the  long \" ( @xmath41 s ) and  short \" ( @xmath42 s ) categories as defined by batse , the swift bat results show faint soft gamma - ray extensions or tails , which extend the duration by a substantial factor beyond what batse would have detected @xcite .",
    "a rich trove of information on the burst and afterglow physics has come from detailed xrt light curves , starting on average 100 seconds after the trigger , together with the corresponding bat light curves and spectra .",
    "this suggests a canonical x - ray afterglow picture @xcite which includes one or more of the following:1 ) an initial steep decay @xmath43 with a temporal index @xmath44 , and an energy spectrum @xmath45 with energy spectral index @xmath46 ( or photon number index @xmath47 ) , extending up to a time @xmath48;2 ) a flatter decay portion @xmath49 with temporal index @xmath50 and energy index @xmath51 , at times @xmath52;3 ) a  normal \" decay @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( generally unchanged the previous stage ) , up to a time @xmath56 , or in some cases longer;4 ) in some cases , a steeper decay @xmath57 with @xmath58 , after @xmath59;5 ) in about half the afterglows , one or more x - ray flares are observed , sometimes starting as early as 100 s after trigger , and sometimes as late as @xmath60 .",
    "the energy in these flares ranges from a percent up to a value comparable to the prompt emission ( in grb 050502b ) .",
    "the rise and decay times of these flares is unusually steep , depending on the reference time @xmath61 , behaving as @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and energy indices which can be also steeper ( e.g. @xmath64 ) than during the smooth decay portions .",
    "the flux level after the flare usually decays to the value extrapolated from the value before the flare rise ( see figure [ fig : xrt - lc ] ) .",
    "the above characteristics are derived mainly from long bursts , but interestingly , at least one of the short bursts shows similar features . however , the evidence for late time activity is more sketchy in short bursts , so that the analogy must be considered with caution .",
    "an exciting result from swift was the detection of the long burst grb 050904 , which broke through the astrophysically and psychologically significant redshift barrier of @xmath65 , which is thought to mark the approximate end of the  dark ages \" , when re - ionization of the intergalactic medium by the first generation of light sources approaches completion .",
    "this burst was very bright , both in its prompt @xmath2-ray emission ( @xmath66 erg ) and in its x - ray afterglow .",
    "prompt ground - based optical / ir upper limits and a j - band detection suggested a photometric redshift @xmath67 @xcite , and spectroscopic confirmation soon followed with the 8.2 m subaru telescope , giving @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "there are several striking features to this burst .",
    "one is the enormous x - ray brightness , exceeding for a full day the x - ray brightness of the most distant x - ray quasar know to - date , sdss j0130 + 0524 , by up to a factor @xmath68 in the first minutes @xcite .",
    "the implications as a tool for probing the intergalactic medium are thought - provoking .",
    "another feature is the extremely variable x - ray light curve , showing many large amplitude flares extending up to at least a day .",
    "a third exciting feature is the report of a brief , very bright ir flash @xcite , comparable in brightness to the famous @xmath69 optical flash in grb 990123 .",
    "a third major advance from swift was the discovery and localization of short grb afterglows .",
    "as of december 2005 nine short bursts had been localized by swift , while in the same period hete-2 discovered two , and one was identified with the ipn network . in five of the short bursts ,",
    "grb 050509b , 050709 , 050724 and 051221a an x - ray afterglow was measured and followed up , with grb 050709 , 050724 and 051221a showing also an optical afterglow , and 050724 also a radio afterglow , while 040924 had an optical afterglow but not an x - ray one @xcite .",
    "these are the first afterglows detected for short bursts .",
    "also , for the first time , host galaxies were identified for these short bursts , which in a number of cases are early type ( ellipticals ) and in other cases are irregular galaxies ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of four of them are in the range @xmath70 , while another one was determined to be @xmath71 ( and less securely , it has been argued that this latter may instead be @xmath72 @xcite ) .",
    "the median @xmath73 is @xmath74 that of the long bursts .",
    "there is no evidence for significant star formation in these host environments ( except for grb 050709 , @xcite , which is compatible with what one expects for an old population , such as neutron star mergers or neutron star - black hole mergers , the most often discussed progenitor candidates ( although it would also be compatible with other progenitors involving old compact stars ) . while the evidence for a neutron star or black merger is suggestive , the evidence is not unequivocal .",
    "e.g. the observations suggest a typical time delay of at least several gyr between the start formation epoch and the explosion of short grbs @xcite .",
    "there are a number of unresolved issues related to this ( see  [ sec : short ] ) .",
    "the first short burst afterglow followed up by swift , grb 050509b , was a rather brief ( @xmath75 ms ) , moderate luminosity ( @xmath76 erg s@xmath77 but low fluence ( @xmath78 erg ) burst with a simple power - law x - ray afterglow which could only be followed for several hundreds of seconds @xcite .",
    "the third one , grb 050724 , was brighter , @xmath79 erg , and could be followed in x - rays with swift for at least @xmath68 s @xcite , and with chandra up to @xmath80 s @xcite .",
    "the remarkable thing about this burst s x - ray afterglow is that it shows some similarities to the typical x - ray light curves described above for long grb  except for the lack of a slow - decay phase , and for the short prompt emission which places it the the category of short bursts , as well as the elliptical host galaxy candidate .",
    "it also has also bumps in the x - ray light curve at 100 s and at @xmath81 s , which resemble some of the long burst x - ray flares and whose origin is unclear .",
    "the first bump or flare has the same fluence as the prompt emission , while the late one has @xmath82 of that .",
    "the interpretation of these pose interesting challenges , as discussed below and in s [ sec : short ] ,    a fourth exciting result from swift was the detection of a long burst , grb 060218 , which was seen also with the xrt and uvot instruments @xcite , and which is associated with sn 2006aj @xcite .",
    "the redshift is @xmath83 , and the contribution to the optical light curve as well as the spectrum are similar to those of the ic type sn1998bw .",
    "the result this is so exciting is that it is the first time that a grb / sn has been observed minutes after the @xmath2-ray trigger at x - ray and uv / optical wavelengths .",
    "this is discussed further in  [ sec : sn ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the ultimate energy source of grb is convincingly associated with a catastrophic energy release in stellar mass objects . for long bursts , this is almost certainly associated with the late stages of the evolution of a massive star , namely the collapse of its core @xcite , which at least in some cases is associated with a detectable supernova . for short bursts ,",
    "it has been long assumed @xcite that they were associated with compact binary mergers ( ns - ns or ns - bh ) , a view which is gaining observational support @xcite , although the issue can not be considered settled yet . in both cases , the central compact object is likely to be a black hole of several solar masses ( although it might , temporarily , be a fast rotating high - mass neutron star , which eventually must collapse to black hole ) . in any case , the gravitational energy liberated in the collapse or merger involves of order a few solar masses , which is converted into free energy on timescales of milliseconds inside a volume of the order of tens of kilometers cubed .",
    "this prompt energy is then augmented by a comparable amount of energy release in a similar or slightly larger volume over a longer timescale of seconds to hundreds of seconds , by the continued infall or accretion of gas onto the central object , either from the central parts of the massive progenitor star or from the debris of the disrupted compact stars which was temporarily held up by its rotation .",
    "the principal result of the sudden release of this large gravitational energy ( of order a solar rest mass ) in this compact volume is the conversion of a fraction of that energy into neutrinos , initially in thermal equilibrium , and gravitational waves ( which are not in thermal equilibrium ) , while a significantly smaller fraction ( @xmath84 ) goes into a high temperature fireball ( @xmath85 mev ) consisting of @xmath86 , @xmath2-rays and baryons .",
    "the fireball is transparent to the gravitational waves , and beyond several interaction lengths , also to the neutrinos .",
    "this leads to the prompt emission ( on timescales of a few seconds ) of roughly comparable energy amounts ( several @xmath87 ergs ) of thermal @xmath88 with typical energies 10 - 30 mev , and of gravitational waves mainly near @xmath89 hz .",
    "these two , by far most dominant , energy forms are so far undetected , and are discussed further in  [ sec : vhe ] . a smaller fraction of the liberated energy , or order @xmath90 ergs remains trapped in a @xmath86 , @xmath2-ray and baryon fireball , which can also contain a comparable ( or in some scenarios a larger ) amount of magnetic field energy .",
    "this amount of energy is observed , mainly as non - thermal gamma - rays . while smaller than the predicted thermal neutrino and gravitational wave fluence , this is nonetheless a formidable electromagnetic energy output , much more intense than any other explosive event in the universe .",
    "while the total energy is comparable to the electromagnetic and kinetic energy of supernovae , the difference is that in supernovae the energy is doled out over months , mainly at optical wavelengths , while in grb most of the electromagnetic energy is spilled out in a matter of seconds , and mainly at @xmath2-ray wavelengths .",
    "the leading model for the electromagnetic radiation observed from grbs is based on the relativistic fireball created in the core collapse or merger .",
    "the photon luminosity inferred from the energies and timescales discussed and from the observations is many orders of magnitude larger than the eddington luminosity @xmath91 erg s@xmath77 , above which radiation pressure exceeds self - gravity , so the fireball will expand .",
    "the first ( thermal ) fireball models were assumed to reach relativistic expansion velocities @xcite .",
    "however , the ultimate expansion velocity depends on the baryon load of the fireball @xcite .",
    "if the fireball energy involved all the baryons in the core ( solar masses ) the expansion would be sub - relativistic .",
    "however , near the black hole the density is reduced due to accretion and centrifugal forces , it is likely that baryons are much depleted in the region where the fireball forms , with a tendency to form high entropy ( high energy / mass ratio ) radiation bubbles .",
    "dynamically dominant magnetic fields would also tend to involve fewer baryons .",
    "a phenomenological argument shows that the expansion must , indeed , be highly relativistic .",
    "this is based on the fact that most of the grb spectral energy is observed above 0.5 mev , so that the mean free path for the @xmath92 process in an isotropic plasma ( an assumption appropriate for a sub - relativistically expanding fireball ) would be very short .",
    "this leads to a contradiction , since many bursts show spectra extending above 1 gev , so the flow must be able to avoid degrading these via photon - photon interactions to energies below the threshold @xmath93 0.511 mev@xcite . to avoid this , it seems inescapable that the flow must be expanding with a very high lorentz factor @xmath94 , since then the relative angle at which the photons collide is less than @xmath95 and the threshold for the pair production is then diminished .",
    "this condition is 10 ^ 2 [ ( _ / 10 gev ) ( _ t /mev ) ] ^1/2  , [ eq : gg ] in order for photons @xmath96 to escape annihilation against target photons of energy @xmath97 mev @xcite .",

    "after the launch of swift , new prompt optical observations with robotic telescopes have greatly added to the phenomenology of prompt flashes ( see  [ sec : swift ]      if the external medium is inhomogeneous , e.g. @xmath439 , the energy conservation condition is @xmath440 constant , so @xmath441 , @xmath442 , which changes the temporal decay rates @xcite .",

    "the outflow had a higher magnetic field and higher density , so the radiation from the @xmath238 edge is harder and more intense .",

    "this effect is thought to be implicated in giving rise to the radio diffractive scintillation pattern seen in several afterglows , since this requires the emitting source to be of small dimensions ( the ring width ) , e.g. in grb 970508 @xcite .",
    "this provided an important observational check , giving a direct confirmation of the relativistic source expansion and a direct determination of the ( expected ) source size @xcite .",

    "more exact treatments are possible @xcite based on following analytically and numerically the detailed dynamical evolution equations for the lorentz factor through and beyond the transition between pre - deceleration and post - deceleration .",
    "the shape of the equi - temporal surfaces is modified , and the expected light curves will be correspondingly changed .",
    "the exact afterglow behavior will depend on the unknown external medium density and on whether and what kind of continued of continued energy injection into the shock occurs , which introduces an additional layer of parameters to be fitted .",
    "the spherical assumption is valid even when considering a relativistic outflow collimated within some jet of solid angle @xmath475 , provided the observer line of sight is inside this angle , and @xmath476 @xcite , so the light - cone is inside the jet boundary ( causally disconnected ) and the observer is unaware of what is outside the jet .",
    "however , as the ejecta is decelerated , the lorentz factor eventually drops below this value , and a change is expected in the dynamics and the light curves @xcite .",

    "the degree of steepening of the observed flux light curve can be estimated by considering that while the causal angle is smaller than the jet opening angle , the effective transverse area from which radiation is received is @xmath483 , whereas after the causal angle becomes larger than the jet angle , the area is @xmath484 .",
    "thus the flux after the break , for an adiabatic behavior @xmath485 ( valid if there is no sideways expansion ) is steeper by a factor @xmath486 @xcite , a value in broad agreement with observed breaks . after this time , if the jet collimation is simply ballistic ( i.e. not due to magnetic or other dynamical effects ) the jet can start expanding sideways at the comoving ( relativistic ) speed of sound , leading to a different decay @xmath487 and @xmath488 @xcite .",

    "this is not significantly larger than the kinetic energies in core - collapse supernovae , but the photons are concentrated in the gamma - ray range , and the outflow is substantially more collimated than in the sn case .",

    "it is worth noting that jets do not invalidate the usefulness of spherical snapshot spectral fits , since the latter constrain only the _ energy per solid angle _",

    "another argument indicating that the medium in the vicinity of at least some long - grb afterglows is not stratified , e.g. as @xmath305 , is the observation of a sharp jet - break in the optical afterglow lightcurves ( as , e.g. in grb 990510 , 000301c , 990123 ) .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , relativistic jets propagating in a wind - like external medium are expected to give rise to a very gradual and shallow break in the afterglow lightcurve .",
    "the discussion above also makes the simplifying assumption of a uniform jet ( uniform energy and lorentz factor inside the jet opening angle , or top - hat jet model ) . in this case the correlation between the inverse beaming factor @xmath498 ( or observationally , the jet break time from which @xmath479 is derived ) and the isotropic equivalent energy or fluence @xmath499 is interpreted as due to a distribution of jet angles , larger angles leading to lower @xmath499 , according to @xmath500 .",

    "the steep initial decay phase @xmath509 in x - rays of the long grb afterglows is one of the most striking .",
    "there are several possible mechanisms which could cause this .",
    "the most obvious first guess would be to attribute it to the cooling following cessation of the prompt emission ( internal shocks or dissipation ) .",
    "if the comoving magnetic field in the emission region is random [ or transverse ] , the flux per unit frequency along the line of sight in a given energy band , as a function of the electron energy index @xmath510 , decays as @xmath511 with @xmath512 $ ] in the slow cooling regime , where @xmath513 , and it decays as @xmath514 $ ] in the fast cooling regime where @xmath515 , i.e. for the standard @xmath516 this would be @xmath517 $ ] in the slow cooling or @xmath518 $ ] in the fast cooling regime , for random [ transverse ] fields @xcite . in some bursts this may be the explanation , but in others the time and spectral indices do not correspond well .",
    "in addition , if the flux along the line of sight decays as steeply as above , the observed flux would be dominated by the so - called high latitude emission , which is discussed next .    at present ,",
    "the most widely considered explanation for the fast decay , both of the initial phase ( 1 ) and of the steep flares , attributes it to the off - axis emission from regions at @xmath519 ( the curvature effect , or high latitude emission @xcite . in this case , after the line of sight gamma - rays have ceased , the off - axis emission observed from @xmath520 is @xmath521 smaller than that from the line of sight . integrating over the equal arrival time region ,",
    "this flux ratio becomes @xmath522 .",
    "since the emission from @xmath461 arrives @xmath523 later than from @xmath524 , the observer sees the flux falling as @xmath525 , if the flux were frequency independent . for a source - frame flux @xmath526 ,",
    "the observed flux per unit frequency varies then as f_(t - t_0)^-2- [ eq : hilat ] i.e. @xmath527",
    ". this  high latitude \" radiation , which for observers outside the line cone at @xmath528 would appear as prompt @xmath2-ray emission from dissipation at radius @xmath124 , appears to observers along the line of sight ( inside the light cone ) to arrive delayed by @xmath529 relative to the trigger time , and its spectrum is softened by the doppler factor @xmath530 into the x - ray observer band . for the initial prompt decay ,",
    "the onset of the afterglow ( e.g. phases 2 or 3 ) , which also come from the line of sight , may overlap in time with the delayed high latitude emission . in equation ( [ eq : hilat ] )",
    "@xmath61 can be taken as the trigger time , or some value comparable or less than equation ( [ eq : tag ] ) .",
    "this can be used to constrain the prompt emission radius @xcite .",
    "when @xmath531 , the emission can have an admixture of high latitude and afterglow , and this can lead to decay rates intermediate between the two @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath61 closer to the onset of the decay also lead to steeper slopes .",
    "it is possible to identify for various bursts values of @xmath61 near the rising part of the last spike in the prompt emission which satisfy the subsequent steep decay slope @xcite .",
    "structured jets , when viewed on - beam produce essentially the same slopes as homogeneous jets , while off - beam observing can lead to shallower slopes @xcite . for the flares ,",
    "if their origin is assumed to be internal ( e.g. some form of late internal shock or dissipation ) the value of @xmath61 is just before the flare , e.g the observer time at which the internal dissipation starts to be observable @xcite .",
    "this interpretation appears , so far , compatible with most of the swift afterglows @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the initial fast decay may be due to the emission of a cocoon of exhaust gas @xcite , where the temporal and spectral index are explained through an approximately power - law behavior of escape times and spectral modification of multiply scattered photons .",
    "the fast decay may also be due to the reverse shock emission , if inverse compton up - scatters primarily synchrotron optical photons into the x - ray range .",
    "the decay starts after the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta and electrons are no longer accelerated , and may have both a line of sight and an off - axis component @xcite .",
    "this poses strong constraints on the compton - y parameter , and can not explain decays much steeper than @xmath532 , or @xmath533 if the off - axis contribution dominates .",
    "models involving bullets , whose origin , acceleration and survivability is unexplained , could give a prompt decay index @xmath534 to @xmath535 @xcite , with a bremsstrahlung energy index @xmath536 which is not observed in the fast decay ; switching to a synchrotron or ic mechanisms requires additional parameters . finally ,",
    "a patchy shell model , where the lorentz factor is highly variable in angle , would produce emission with @xmath537 .",
    "thus , such mechanisms may explain the more gradual decays , but not the more extreme @xmath538 values encountered in some cases .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the swift x - ray observations suggest that the steep decay is a direct continuation of the prompt emission @xcite , which in turn suggests that the prompt and the fast decaying emission arise from the same physical region , posing a problem for the models in this paragraph ( but not for the high latitude emission model ) .      the slow decay portion of the x - ray light curves ( @xmath539 ) , ubiquitously detected by swift , is not entirely new , having been detected in a few cases by bepposax .",
    "this , as well as the appearance of wiggles and flares in the x - ray light curves after several hours were the motivation for the  refreshed shock \" scenario @xcite (  [ sec : refresh ] ) .",
    "refreshed shocks can flatten the afterglow light curve for hours or days , even if the ejecta is all emitted promptly at @xmath540 , but with a range of lorentz factors , say @xmath541 , where the lower @xmath94 shells arrive much later to the foremost fast shells which have already been decelerated .",
    "thus , for an external medium of density @xmath542 and a prompt injection where the lorentz factor spread relative to ejecta mass and energy is @xmath543 , @xmath544 , the forward shock flux temporal decay is given by @xcite = [ ( k-4)(1+s)+(24 -7k + sk)]/[2(7+s-2k ) ]  , [ eq : shallow ] ( for more details , see table [ tab : refr ] ) .",
    "it needs to be emphasized that in this model all the ejection can be prompt ( e.g. over the duration @xmath545 of the gamma ray emission ) but the low @xmath94 portions arrive at ( and refresh ) the forward shock at late times , which can range from hours to days .",
    "i.e. , it is not the central engine which is active late , but its effects are seen late .",
    "fits of such refreshed shocks to observed shallow decay phases in swift bursts @xcite lead to a @xmath94 distribution which is a broken power law , extending above and below a peak around @xmath546 .",
    "there is a different version of refreshed shocks , which does envisage central engine activity extending for long periods of time , e.g. @xmath547 day ( in contrast to the @xmath547 minutes engine activity in the model above ) .",
    "such long - lived activity may be due to continued fall - back into the central black hole @xcite or a magnetar wind @xcite .",
    "one characteristic of both types of refreshed models is that after the refreshed shocks stop and the usual decay resumes , the flux level shows a step - up relative to the previous level , since new energy has been injected .    from current analyses ,",
    "the refreshed shock model is generally able to explain the flatter temporal x - ray slopes seen by swift , both when it is seen to join smoothly on the prompt emission ( i.e. without an initial steep decay phase ) or when seen after an initial steep decay .",
    "questions remain concerning the interpretation of the fluence ratio in the shallow x - ray afterglow and the prompt gamma - ray emission , which can reach @xmath548 @xcite .",
    "this requires a higher radiative efficiency in the prompt gamma - ray emission than in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "one might speculate that this might be achieved if the prompt outflow is poynting - dominated , or if a more efficient afterglow hides more of its energy in other bands , e.g. in gev , or ir .",
    "alternatively @xcite , a previous mass ejection might have emptied a cavity into which the ejecta moves , leading to greater efficiency at later times ( although this would not work above the cooling frequency , which from the spectrum appears to be required in about half the cases ) , or otherwise the energy fraction going into the electrons increases @xmath549 .",
    "other possible ways of addressing this include the afterglow coming from off - axis directions @xcite , and exploring plausible reasons for having underestimated in previous studies the energy of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "refreshed shocks can also explain some of the x - ray flares whose rise and decay slopes are not too steep .",
    "however , this model encounters difficulties with the very steep flares with rise or decay indices @xmath550 , such as inferred from the giant flare of grb 0500502b @xcite around 300 s after the trigger . also , the flux level increase in this flare is a factor @xmath551 above the smooth afterglow before and after it , implying a comparable energy excess in the low versus high @xmath94 material .",
    "an explanation based on inverse compton scattering in the reverse shock @xcite can explain a single flare at the beginning of the afterglow , with not too steep decay . for multiple flares ,",
    "models invoking encountering a lumpy external medium have generic difficulties explaining steep rises and decays @xcite , although extremely dense , sharp - edged lumps , if they exist , might satisfy the steepness @xcite .",
    "currently the more widely considered model for the flares ascribes them to late central engine activity @xcite .",
    "the strongest argument in favor of this is that the energy budget is more easily satisfied , and the fast rise / decay is straightforward to explain . in such a model the flare energy can be comparable to the prompt emission , the fast rise comes naturally from the short time variability leading to internal shocks ( or to rapid reconnection ) , while the rapid decay may be due to the high latitude emission following the flare , with @xmath61 reset to the beginning of each flare ( see further discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , some flares are well modeled by refreshed forward shocks , while in others this is clearly ruled out and a central engine origin is better suited @xcite . aside from the phenomenological desirability based on energetics and timescales",
    ", a central engine origin is conceivable , within certain time ranges , based on numerical models of the burst origin in long bursts .",
    "these are interpreted as being due to core collapse of a massive stellar progenitor , where continued infall into fast rotating cores can continue for a long time @xcite",
    ". however , large flares with a fluence which is a sizable fraction of the prompt emission occurring hours later remain difficult to understand .",
    "it has been argued that gravitational instabilities in the infalling debris torus can lead to lumpy accretion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the accreting debris torus is dominated by mhd effects , magnetic instabilities can lead to extended , highly time variable accretion @xcite , which may give rise to grb x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "the late steep decay decay phase ( 4 ) of  [ sec : swift ] is seen in a modest fraction of the swift bursts , mainly in x - rays , and mainly but not exclusively in long bursts .",
    "the natural interpretation is that these are caused by the fact that the outflow is collimated into a jet break : when the decrease of the ejecta lorentz factor leads to the light - cone angle becoming larger than the jet angular extent , @xmath552 ( e.g.  [ sec : jet ] ) , the light curve steepens achromatically . for the swift bursts , it is noteworthy that this final steepening has been seen in less than @xmath82 of the afterglows followed , and then with reasonable confidence mainly in x - rays .",
    "the corresponding optical light curve breaks have been few , and not well constrained .",
    "the uvot finds afterglows in only @xmath35 of the bursts , and ground - based optical / ir telescopes have yielded few continued late time light curves monitored .",
    "this is unlike the case with the @xmath553 beppo - sax bursts , for which an achromatic break was reported in the optical @xcite , while in rarer cases there was an x - ray or radio break reported , which in a few cases appeared to occur at a different time than the optical break ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the relative paucity of optical breaks in swift afterglows may be an observational selection effect due to the larger median redshift , and hence fainter and redder optical afterglow at the same observer epoch . at higher redshifts",
    "the break occurs later in the observer frame , which compounds a possible reluctance to commit large telescope time on more frequently reported bursts ( roughly 2/week from swift versus an earlier 2/month with beppo - sax ) .",
    "one can speculate that the apparent scarcity of detected light curve breaks might indicate that at higher redshifts the opening angle is intrinsically larger . however , continued monitoring of the x - ray light curves with both swift and chandra is resulting in a growing number of bursts with high quality late x - ray light curves showing in some cases a clear break , and others the absence of a break up to weeks ( also in short bursts , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is an evolving topic , with some indications that light curve breaks may not ( or not always ) appear achromatic @xcite .",
    "optical / uv afterglows have been detected with the swift uvot telescope in roughly half the bursts for which an x - ray afterglow was seen . for a more detailed discussion of the uvot afterglow observations",

    "of particular interest is the ongoing discussion on whether  dark grb \" are really optically deficient , or the result of observational bias @xcite .",
    "another puzzle is the report of a bimodal intrinsic brightness distribution in the rest - frame r - band @xcite .",
    "this suggests possibly the existence of two different classes of long bursts , or at least two different types of environments .",
    "compared to a few years ago , a much larger role is being played by ground - based robotic optical follow - ups , due to the increased rate of several arc - second x - ray alerts from xrt , and the larger number of robotic telescopes brought on - line in the last years .",
    "for the most part , these detections have yielded optical decays in the @xmath554 few 100 s range , initial brightness @xmath555 and temporal decay slopes @xmath556 previously associated with the evolution of a forward shock @xcite . in a few cases , a prompt optical detection was achieved in the first 12 - 25 s @xcite .",
    "= 5.in    the most exciting prompt robotic ir detection ( and optical non - detection ) is that of grb 050904 @xcite .",
    "this object , at the unprecedented high redshift of @xmath38 @xcite , has an x - ray brightness exceeding for a day that of the brightest x - ray quasars ( see figure [ fig:050904_xrlc ] ) @xcite .",
    "its o / ir brightness in the first 500 s ( observer time ) was comparable to that of the extremely bright ( @xmath69 ) optical flash in grb 990123 , with a similarly steep time - decay slope @xmath557 @xcite .",
    "such prompt , bright and steeply decaying optical emission is expected from the reverse shock as it crosses the ejecta , marking the start of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "however , aside from the two glaring examples of 990123 and 050904 , in the last six years there have been less than a score of other prompt optical flashes , typically with more modest initial brightnesses @xmath558 .",
    "there are a number of possible reasons for this paucity of optically bright flashes , if ascribed to reverse shock emission .",
    "one is the absence or weakness of a reverse shock , e.g. if the ejecta is highly magnetized @xcite .",
    "a moderately magnetized ejecta is in fact favored for some prompt flashes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the deceleration might occur in the thick - shell regime ( @xmath559 .",
    "( [ eq : tag ] ) , which can result in the reverse shock being relativistic , boosting the optical reverse shock spectrum into the uv @xcite ( in this case a detection by uvot might be expected , unless the decay is faster than the typical 100 - 200 s for uvot slewing and integration ) .",
    "another possibility , for a high comoving luminosity , is copious pair formation in the ejecta , causing the reverse shock spectrum to peak in the ir @xcite . since both grb 990123 and grb 050904 had @xmath560 erg , among the top few percent of all bursts , the latter is a distinct possibility , compatible with the fact that the prompt flash in grb 050904 was bright in the ir i - band but not in the optical . on the other hand",
    ", the redshift @xmath38 of this burst , and a ly-@xmath413 cutoff at @xmath561 nm would also ensure this ( and grb 990123 , at @xmath562 , was detected in the v - band ) .",
    "however , the observations of optical flashes in these two objects but not in lower @xmath21 objects appears compatible with having a relativistic ( thick shell ) reverse shock with pair formation . even in the absence of pairs ,",
    "more accurate calculations of the reverse shock @xcite find the emission to be significantly weaker than was estimated earlier .",
    "another possibility is that the cooling frequency in reverse shock is typically not much larger than the optical band frequency . in this case",
    "the optical emission from the reverse shock drops to zero very rapidly soon after the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta and the cooling frequency drops below the optical and there are no electrons left to radiate in the optical band @xcite .",
    "swift , and in smaller numbers hete-2 , have provided the first bona fide short burst x - ray afterglows followed up starting @xmath33 s after the trigger , leading to localizations and redshifts . in the first of these , grb 050509b @xcite the extrapolation of the prompt bat emission into the x - ray range , and the xrt light curve from 100 s to about 1000 s ( after which only upper limits exist , even with chandra , due to the faintness of the burst ) can be fitted with a single power law of @xmath563 1.2 ( 1.12 to 1.29 90% conf ) , or separately as @xmath564 1.34 ( 0.27 to 2.87 90% conf ) and @xmath5651.1 ( 0.57 to 2.36 90% conf ) . the x - ray coverage was sparse due to orbital constraints , the number of x - ray photons being small , and no optical transient was identified , probably due to the faintness of the source .",
    "an optical host was however identified , an elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "the next one , discovered by hete-2 , was grb 050709 @xcite .",
    "its host @xcite is an irregular galaxy at @xmath566 ( and the observations ruled out any supernova association ) .",
    "even earlier , hete-2 reported the short grb 040924 @xcite , with a soft gamma - ray prompt emission and a faint broken power law optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "a proposed host galaxy at @xmath567 shows star formation , and evidence for an associated 1998bw - like sn contribution to the light curve @xcite , which suggests this is perhaps the short end of the long burst or xrf distribution . the next swift short burst , grb 050724 , was relatively bright , and besides x - rays , it also yielded both a decaying optical and a radio afterglow @xcite .",
    "this burst , together with a significant part of other short bursts , is associated with an elliptical host galaxy .",
    "it also had a low - luminosity soft gamma - ray extension of the short hard gamma - ray component ( which would have been missed by batse ) , and it had an interesting x - ray afterglow extending beyond @xmath68 s @xcite ( figure [ fig:050724_xrlc ] ) .",
    "the soft gamma - ray extension , lasting up to 200 s , when extrapolated to the x - ray range overlaps well with the beginning of the xrt afterglow , which between 100 and 300 s has @xmath568 , followed by a much steeper drop @xmath569 out to @xmath570 , then a more moderate decay @xmath571 .",
    "an unexpected feature is a strong flare peaking at @xmath572 s , whose energy is 10% of the prompt emission , while its amplitude is a 10 times increase over the preceding slow decay . among more recent swift short bursts , such as grb",

    "grb 051221a had x - ray and optical afterglows , and the host is a star forming galaxy at @xmath574 @xcite .",
    "the main challenges for an understanding of the mechanism of short bursts are the relatively long , soft tail of the prompt emission , and the strength and late occurrence of the x - ray bumps or flares . a possible explanation for the extended long soft tails ( @xmath575 ) may be that the compact binary progenitor is a black hole - neutron star system @xcite , for which analytical and numerical arguments ( @xcite , and references therein ) suggest that the disruption and swallowing by the black hole may lead to a complex and more extended accretion rate than for double neutron stars ( c.f .",
    "the flares , for which the simplest interpretation might be to ascribe them to refreshed shocks ( compatible with a short engine duration @xmath576 s and a distribution of lorentz factors ) , requires the energy in the slow material to be at least ten times as energetic as the fast material responsible for the prompt emission , for the grb 050724 flare at @xmath577 s. the rise and decay times are moderate enough for this interpretation within the errors . on the other hand ,",
    "if the decay slope is -2.8 , this is steeper than expected for refreshed shocks , but consistent with the high - latitude @xmath533 model ; a time origin @xmath61 can be determined at the beginning of the flare , and late chandra observations indicate that the decay after the resumes where it had left off before the flare , which is more consistent with a late engine activity interpretation @xcite , requiring a factor 10 less energy budget than the refreshed shock interpretation .",
    "another interpretation for such flares might be an accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf in a binary , leading to a flare when the fireball created by the collapse hits the companion @xcite , which might explain moderate energy one - time flares of duration @xmath578 s. however , for repeated , energetic flares , as also in the long bursts , the total energetics are easier to satisfy if one postulates late central engine activity ( lasting at least half a day ) , containing @xmath82 of the prompt fluence @xcite .",
    "a possible way to produce this might be temporary choking up of an mhd outflow @xcite ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , which might also imply a linear polarization of the x - ray flare @xcite . such mhd effects could plausibly also explain the initial @xmath33 s soft tail .",
    "another magnetic mechanism proposed for late x - ray flares in short bursts invokes a temporary post - merger massive neutron star @xcite .",
    "however , a justification for substantial @xmath579 s features remains so far on rather tentative grounds .",
    "= 5.in    the similarity of the x - ray afterglow light curve with those of long bursts is , in itself , an argument in favor of the prevalent view that the afterglows of both long and short bursts can be described by the same paradigm , independently of any difference in the progenitors .",
    "this impression is reinforced by the fact that the x - ray light curve temporal slope is , on average , that expected from the usual forward shock afterglow model , and that in grb 050724 the x - ray afterglow shows what appears like an initial steep decay , a normal decay and a significant bump or flare .",
    "the identification of jet breaks in short bursts is still preliminary , and the subject of debate . in two short bursts ( so far )",
    "evidence evidence has been reported for a jet break @xcite .",
    "( however , in grb 050724 a late chandra observation indicates no x - ray break @xcite ) . taking these breaks as jet breaks ,",
    "the average isotropic energy of these shbs is a factor @xmath33 smaller , while the average jet opening angle ( based on the two breaks ) is a factor @xmath37 larger than those of typical long grbs @xcite .",
    "using standard afterglow theory , the bulk lorentz factor decay can be expressed through @xmath580 , where @xmath408 , @xmath423 is the external density in units of @xmath425 , and @xmath581 is the isotropic equivalent energy in units of @xmath582 ergs .",

    "a better determined case of an x - ray light curve break is that of grb 051221a , where combined swift xrt and chandra observations indicate a late break at @xmath584 days , leading to an estimated @xmath585 degrees @xcite .",
    "this is similar to jet angles calculated numerically for compact merger scenarios by @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that there are some indications that light curve breaks may not ( or not always ) be achromatic @xcite .",
    "we note that chromatic breaks have been argued for in some long bursts , e.g. grb 030329 , suggesting different beam opening angles for the optical / x - ray and the radio components ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and independently of whether this is the explanation , a similar phenomenon may be present in short bursts .",
    "the most dramatic impact of swift concerning short grb , after the discovery and characterization of the afterglows , has been in providing the first significant identifications of host galaxies , with the implications and constraints that this puts on the progenitor issue .",
    "out of ten short bursts detected until the end 2005 , four of the hosts ( grb 040924 , 050509b , 050724 and 050813 ; @xcite ) are elliptical galaxies , one ( grb 050709 , @xcite ) is a nearby irregular galaxy , and one ( grb 050906 , @xcite ) is a star - forming galaxy .",
    "the number of elliptical hosts is of significant interest for the most frequently discussed progenitor of short grb , the merger of neutron star binaries @xcite , which would be relatively more abundant in old stellar population galaxies such as ellipticals .",
    "the argument partly depends on the expected long binary merger times , which in early population synthesis and merger simulations @xcite was taken to be in excess of @xmath586 years .",
    "more recent populations synthesis calculations @xcite have reduced this to the point where compact mergers could be expected in substantial numbers also in young , e.g. star - forming galaxies , although statistically most mergers would be expected in old galaxies .",
    "the preponderance of claimed elliptical hosts , where star formation is absent , argues against alternative short burst origins such as short - lived outflows from massive stellar collapses @xcite . the lack of any observed supernova emission weeks after the burst @xcite also argues against a massive stellar collapse ( where a ib / c supernova could be expected ) , and also against a gravitational collapse of c / o white dwarfs to neutron stars leading to a supernova ia @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of short bursts is that they may be the initial brief , hard spike seen in giant flares of soft gamma repeaters , or sgr @xcite .",
    "sgrs must be young objects , due to the fast field decay rate , and the total energy in giant sgr flares detected so far is at least two orders of magnitude too small to explain the short burst fluxes detected at @xmath587 .",
    "the lack of recent star formation activity in the four mentioned elliptical hosts also indicates that at least some short bursts can not be ascribed to sgrs .",
    "a statistical analysis indicates that the fraction of short bursts which could be due to sgrs is less than 15% ( or less than 40% at 95% confidence level ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that a correlation analysis of short bursts with x - ray selected galaxy clusters @xcite gives a better than @xmath588 angular cross - correlation with clusters up to @xmath589 , which compared to model predictions would indicate that most short bursts originate within @xmath590 mpc .",
    "any connection between alternative candidates and a possible third category of bursts , intermediate between short and long @xcite remains so far unexplored .      with over a half dozen",
    "reasonably well studied short bursts ( as of end of 2005 ) , their distribution in redshift space and among host galaxy types , including both ellipticals and spiral / irregulars @xcite , is similar to that of other old population objects , and thus is compatible with neutron star binaries or black hole - neutron star binaries @xcite .",
    "this progenitor identification , however , can not be considered secure , so far .",
    "nonetheless , the most striking thing about short hard burst ( or shbs ) hosts is that it includes a number of ellipticals , with low star formation rate ( sfr ) , e.g. 050909b , 050724 ; and even for those shbs with star forming hosts , e.g. 050709 , 051221a , the sfr is lower than the median sfr for the long grb hosts @xcite .",
    "this confirms that they are a distinct population , as indicated also by their intrinsic spectral - temporal properties versus those of long bursts @xcite . using the batse flux distribution and the observed redshifts ,",
    "the shb local rates are inferred to be at least @xmath18 gpc@xmath591 yr@xmath77 @xcite without beaming corrections , and larger including beaming .",
    "the progenitor lifetimes lead to interesting constraints , e.g. the simple time delay distribution @xmath592 expected from galactic double neutron star systems appears in conflict with the low average redshift of shbs @xcite , although it is not ruled out @xcite .",
    "this has led to inferring a typical lifetime for the progenitors of @xmath593 gyr , and the suggestion that they might be neutron star - black hole binaries , rather than double neutron stars .",
    "however if the redshift @xmath594 for grb 050813 is correct , the lifetime of the progenitor would be constrained to @xmath595 gyr @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", consideration of the star formation history of both early and late type galaxies suggests that at least half of the shb progenitors have lifetimes in excess of @xmath18 gyr @xcite .",
    "population synthesis models of double compact binaries @xcite indicate two populations , with short ( @xmath596 myr and long ( @xmath597 myr ) merger times , with ns - ns and bh - ns binaries distributed roughly 1:1 and 4:1 between these two merger time ranges , in apparent agreement with current shb redshift and host distributions between ellipticals and sfr galaxies . the origin of a fraction of double neutron stars in globular clusters @xcite would help to explain short bursts which are offset from their host galaxy .",
    "out of the @xmath598 long bursts ( @xmath41 s ) detected by swift up to the end of 2005 , in all cases where a host galaxy was identified this was of an early type , usually a blue star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
    "this was also the case for the thirty - some cases measured by beppo - sax ( e.g. @xcite ) in the previous seven years .",
    "more recent observational studies have indicated also that the long grb host galaxy metallicity is generally lower than that of the average massive star forming galaxies @xcite .",

    "the preponderance of short - lived massive star formation in such young galaxies , as well as the identification of a sn ib / c light curve peaking weeks after the burst in few cases , has provided strong support for a massive stellar collapse origin of long grbs , as argued by @xcite .",
    "the relatively long duration of the gamma - ray emission stage in these bursts ( @xmath602 ) is generally ascribed to a correspondingly long duration for the accretion of the debris @xcite falling into the central black hole which must form as the core of a massive star collapses .",

    "the latter mechanism is observationally on a less firm footing than the first , and in both collapse and merger cases the black hole could be preceded by a temporary massive , highly magnetized neutron star .",

    "the development of a jet and its lorentz factor in a collapsar has been discussed analytically in @xcite .",
    "the essence of the dynamics of the jet in a burst from a massive star is that as long as the central bh accretes , it injects along the rotation axis a relativistic jet , whose dimensionless entropy must be comparable to or larger than the final bulk lorentz factor of the jet once it has emerged from the star , @xmath614 .",
    "even though such a jet is highly relativistic as it is injected , the overburden of the stellar core and envelope slow the jet head down to a sub - relativistic speed of advance , which gradually increases as the jet moves down the density gradient of the star . the difference between the injection and advance speed causes gas and energy spill - over into a transrelativistic cocoon of waste heat @xcite surrounding the jet , which may be detectable @xcite . by the time it reaches the boundary of the he core ( @xmath615 cm )",

    "the jet head lorentz factor shoots up to a value comparable to its final value , @xmath617 ( @xcite).once the jet head is relativistic , it becomes ballistic , and it is no longer affected by whether the central engine energy injection continues or not .",

    "such a jet profile is a possible interpretation @xcite of the observational correlation between the isotropic equivalent jet energy and the jet break time derived from a sample of burst afterglows @xcite .",

    "for instance , nucleons entrained in the fireball will have @xmath625 gev bulk kinetic energies in the observer frame , which can lead to inelastic collisions resulting in pions , muons , neutrinos and electrons as well as their anti - particles .",

    "the expected flux and spectrum of 130  gev neutrinos and @xmath2-rays resulting from pion decay due to interactions within the expanding plasma depends , e.g. , on the neutron / proton ratio and on fireball inhomogeneities , while that due to interactions with the surrounding medium depends on the external gas density and its distribution ; and both depend on the lorentz factor .",
    "massive progenitors offer denser targets for nuclear collisions and a larger photon density for @xmath626 and @xmath624 interactions , leading to modification of the photon spectra . on the other hand grb from ns - ns mergers",
    "would be characterized by neutron - rich outflows , leading to stronger 5 - 10 gev neutrinos and photons from @xmath627 collisions @xcite .",
    "photo - pion signatures of @xmath625 gev photons and @xmath628 ev neutrinos may be expected to be relatively stronger in massive ( high soft photon density ) progenitors .",
    "knowing what fraction of grb , if any , arise from ns mergers is vital for facilitating interferometric gravitational wave detections , e.g. with ligo . and ,",
    "conversely , detection with ligo would provide important clues as to whether short bursts are ns - ns ( or ns - bh ) mergers , or whether massive stellar collapses are asymmetric enough to produce substantial gravitational wave emission and serve as a test of the relationship between long grb and supernovae .    the fermi mechanism in shocks developing in the grb outflow can also accelerate protons to observer - frame energies up to @xmath629 ev @xcite .",
    "internal shocks leading to the observed @xmath2-rays have a high comoving photon density and lead to @xmath626 photopion production and to @xmath625 tev neutrinos @xcite . in external shocks due to deceleration by the external medium ,",

    "neutrinos in the tev to eev range may be easier to detect than those at @xmath631  gev energies , due to their higher interaction cross section , with instruments currently under construction .",
    "such neutrinos would serve as diagnostics of the presence of relativistic shocks , and as probes of the acceleration mechanism and the magnetic field strength . the flux and spectrum of @xmath630 ev neutrinos depends on the density of the surrounding gas , while the @xmath632 ev neutrinos depend on the fireball lorentz factor .",
    "hence , the detection of very high energy neutrinos would provide crucial constraints on the fireball parameters and grb environment .",
    "ultra - high energy emission , in the range of gev and harder , is expected from electron inverse compton in external shocks @xcite as well as from internal shocks @xcite in the prompt phase .",
    "the combination of prompt mev radiation from internal shocks and a more prolonged gev ic component for external shocks @xcite is a likely explanation for the delayed gev emission seen in some grb @xcite .",

    "the ic gev photon component is likely to be significantly more important @xcite than a possible proton synchrotron or electron synchrotron component at these energies .",
    "another possible contributor at these energies may be @xmath268 decay from @xmath626 interactions between shock - accelerated protons and mev or other photons in the grab shock region @xcite . however , under the conservative assumption that the relativistic proton energy does not exceed the energy in relativistic electrons or in @xmath2-rays , and that the proton spectral index is -2.2 instead of -2 , both the proton synchrotron and the @xmath626 components can be shown to be substantially less important at gev - tev than the ic component @xcite .",
    "another gev photon component is expected from the fact that in a baryonic grb outflow neutrons are likely to be present , and when these decouple from the protons , before any shocks occur , @xmath633 inelastic collisions will lead to pions , including @xmath268 , resulting in uhe photons which cascade down to the gev range @xcite .",
    "the final gev spectrum results from a complex cascade , but a rough estimate indicates that 1 - 10 gev flux should be detectable @xcite with glast @xcite for bursts at @xmath634 .    in these models , due to the high photon densities implied by grb models , @xmath624 absorption within the grb emission region must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "one interesting result is that the observation of photons up to a certain energy , say 10 - 20 gev with egret , puts a lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , from the fact that the compactness parameter ( optical depth to @xmath624 ) is directly proportional to the comoving photon density , and both this as well as the energy of the photons depend on the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "this has been used by @xcite to estimate lower limits on @xmath635 for a number of specific bursts observed with egret . on the other hand , for grb with @xmath636 , tev photons can escape the source @xcite .",
    "long grb have recently been shown to be associated with supernovae (  [ sec : sn ] ) .",

    "the imaging of the surrounding emission could provide new constraints on the jet structure of the grb .",
    "the recent detection of delayed x - ray flares during the afterglow phase of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with the swift satellite ( e.g. @xcite ) suggests an inner - engine origin of these flares , at radii inside the deceleration radius characterizing the beginning of the forward shock afterglow emission .",
    "given the observed temporal overlapping between the flares and afterglows , one expects an inverse compton ( ic ) emission arising from such flare photons scattered by forward shock afterglow electrons @xcite .",
    "the jet may also ic upscatter shock break - out x - ray photons @xcite .",
    "this ic emission would produce gev - tev flares , which may be detected by glast and ground - based tev telescopes .",

    "better sensitivity is expected from the upgraded larger version of milagro , as well as from atmospheric cherenkov telescopes under construction such as veritas , hess , magic and cangaroo - iii @xcite .",
    "however , grb detections in the tev range are expected only for rare nearby events , since at this energy the mean free path against @xmath624 absorption on the diffuse ir photon background is @xmath29 few hundred mpc @xcite .",
    "the mean free path is much larger at gev energies , and based on the handful of grb reported in this range with egret , several hundred should be detectable with large area space - based detectors such as glast @xcite",
    ".      in the standard fireball shock model of the prompt @xmath2-ray emission , say from internal shocks or magnetic dissipation , and also in the external afterglow shocks , the same acceleration mechanisms which lead to the non - thermal electron power laws implied by the observed photon spectra must also lead to proton acceleration .",
    "using the shock parameters inferred from broad - band photon spectral fits , one infers that protons can be accelerated to lorentz factors up to @xmath641 in the observer frame @xcite , i.e. to so - called gzk energy of @xmath642 ev .",
    "this is interesting mainly for  baryonic \" jets , where the bulk of the energy is carried by baryons , whereas in poynting - dominated jets there would be much fewer protons to accelerate .",
    "well below the gzk energy , protons interacting with the mev photons present in grb or with thermal nucleons are above the pion production threshold and can produce ultra - high energy neutrinos , as discussed below .",
    "discussions of grb as cosmic ray sources are mainly oriented at exploring their contribution to the energy range above eev ( @xmath643 ev ; e.g. @xcite ) , referred to as ultra - high energy cosmic rays , or uhecrs .",
    "( a model where grb are responsible for crs ranging from pev to gzk is @xcite ) . at eev and",

    "two broad classes of models suggested are the `` top - down '' scenarios , which attribute uhecr to decay of fossil grand unification defects , and the `` bottom - up '' scenarios , which assume uhecrs are accelerated in astrophysical sources .",
    "one of the most prominent candidate sources for bottom - up scenarios is grbs @xcite ( two others are agns , e.g. @xcite and cluster shocks , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most commonly discussed version of this scenario considers the uhecr to be protons accelerated in grb internal shocks @xcite , while another version attributes them to acceleration in external shocks @xcite .",
    "( for uhecr acceleration in alternative grb models , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the persuasiveness of this scenario is largely based on two coincidences , namely , the required condition to accelerate protons to gzk energies is similar to the requirement for generating the prompt observed gamma - rays in grb , and the observed uhecr energy injection rate into the universe ( @xmath644 ) is similar to the local grb @xmath2-ray energy injection rate @xcite .",
    "these coincidences have been questioned , e.g. @xcite , but these objections have been resolved using new data and further considerations @xcite , and grbs remain a promising candidate for uhecrs .",
    "however , there are some caveats of principle .",
    "the internal shock scenario relies on the assumption that grb prompt gamma - ray emission is due to internal shocks .",
    "although this is the leading scenario , there is no strong proof so far , as is the case for the external shock ( e.g. , there are efficiency and spectrum issues , etc . ) . on the other hand",
    ", a poynting flux dominated grb model would have to rely on magnetic dissipation and reconnection , accelerating electrons and hence also accelerating protons- but details remain to be investigated .",
    "the external shock model would have to rely on a magnetized medium @xcite to reach the desired cosmic ray energy ( as expected in pulsar wind bubbles @xcite in the supranova scenario @xcite , which however has become less likely since the almost simultaneous grb 030329/sn 2003dh and the more recent grb 060218/sn2006aj association ) .",

    "the directional information may either prove or significantly constrain the alternative agn scenario , and may eventually shed light on whether grbs are indeed the sources of uhecrs .",
