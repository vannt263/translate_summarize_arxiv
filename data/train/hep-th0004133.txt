    "there has been renewed interest in kaluza ",
    "klein theories over the past two years , mainly due to the realization that localization of matter @xcite and localization of gravity @xcite may drastically change the commonly assumed properties of such models .",
    "these theories clearly open new approaches to the cosmological constant problem , since using extra dimensions the no - go theorem of weinberg for adjustment mechanisms @xcite may be circumvented .",
    "a particularly simple scenario has been recently suggested in @xcite to at least improve on the cosmological constant problem ( see also @xcite for an earlier mechanism involving extra dimensions ) , by proposing a mechanism for the cancellation of all order standard model ( sm ) loop contributions and the leading ( tree - level ) gravity contribution to the effective 4d cosmological constant , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fundamental scale of gravity , the planck scale in the bulk for instance .",
    "the mechanism is based on a single 3-brane ( to which the sm fields are localized ) embedded into a 4 + 1 dimensional space - time .",
    "the essential new ingredient is a bulk scalar field @xmath9 , which is coupled to the brane tension @xmath10 ( assumed to be the full loop - corrected sm vacuum energy density ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite then showed that one can find static solutions to the classical equations of motion for a vanishing bulk potential of the scalar field , but for arbitrary values of the brane tension @xmath10 .",
    "however , all the solutions found in @xcite which localize gravity involve a naked space - time singularity , which has been interpreted as the boundary of the extra dimension ( see also @xcite for a discussion on singularity in a brane - world context ) .",
    "since the bulk is effectively compactified , we have to worry whether the size of the extra dimension is compatible with our phenomenological knowledge of gravity which has been tested up to millimeter distances . the proper distance from the brane to the singularity",
    "is found to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 5d planck scale , which is related to the 4d planck scale , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 .",
    "if the tension , associated to the vacuum energy of the sm fields , is of the order of the electroweak scale , @xmath15 , we naturally obtain , is the gauge hierarchy problem in this model and a mechanism , such as low energy supersymmetry for instance , is needed to cancel the quadratic divergences which should bring @xmath10 near @xmath16 . ]",
    "@xmath17 which is phenomenologically safe . finally , while the sm contribution to the 4d cosmological constant would be of the order of @xmath18 , the self - tuning mechanism cancels this term . however , the next possible term is of the order of @xmath19 , which is still forty orders of magnitude too large .",
    "it is worth noticing that the self - tuning mechanism eliminates twenty orders of magnitude and thus should be considered on equal footing to the randall  sundrum solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the necessity of singularities in the bulk is here only dictated by the phenomenological requirement of localized gravity .",
    "however it complements the singularity theorem of hawking and penrose under which generic initial conditions lead to singular solutions of einstein s equations @xcite .",
    "several works @xcite have studied the self - tuning mechanism . in this paper",
    ", we examine the general properties of the solutions to the coupled 5d scalar - gravity system in detail .",
    "first , we investigate the solutions in the presence of a general bulk potential for the scalar field .",
    "the motivation to include a scalar bulk potential are twofold : _",
    "( i ) _ to give a mass to the scalar field and thus evade the cosmological problems associated to a massless scalar field coupled to gravity and/or those associated to an unstabilized extra - dimension ; _ ( ii ) _ to overcome the singularity problem by considering a more general bulk geometry .",
    "we explain that the self - tuning behavior is expected to occur for a generic bulk potential .",
    "however , in the generic solutions ( except for a vanishing bulk potential ) self - tuning does have the more restricted interpretation that there is at least a finite region for the brane tension for which static solutions can be found ( but not necessarily for all values of @xmath10 ) .",
    "more precisely , standard model corrections are expected to occur at the weak scale , whereas self - tuning works up to the larger 5d planck scale .    after presenting our general results and methods on the solutions in the presence of a generic bulk potential",
    "we ask the following question : are there bulk potentials such that the self - tuning solutions avoid naked space - time singularities for a range of values of the brane tension in such a way , that gravity is localized to the brane ( so as to reproduce 4d gravity for the observer on the brane ) . we show that for the 5d scalar - gravity system the only possibility for such solutions is when space - time asymptotes to five dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads@xmath20 ) far from the brane ( therefore producing solutions of the sort considered in @xcite ) . after a careful analysis",
    "we show that such solutions are always fine - tuned ; that is , they occur only for particular isolated values of the brane tension @xmath10 .",
    "we show that the number of allowed brane tensions is related to the number of negative stationary points of the bulk potential , which appears as a maximal index . in the case of an oscillatory bulk potential ,",
    "we thus obtain a quantization of the brane tension as in a brane world construction from supergravity @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our method for searching for solutions of the coupled scalar - gravity system using the superpotential formalism of @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it results in first order ordinary differential equations , and all the degrees of freedom are transparent without having to make a particular ansatz for the solution . in section 3",
    "we present a class of exactly solvable systems , given by an exponential bulk potential , which includes all the models presented in @xcite .",
    "we analyze these models in detail and find that all of these solutions necessarily involve a naked singularity or lead to an infinite planck scale on the brane .",
    "we also find that , by relaxing an ansatz for solutions made in @xcite , the exponential bulk potential is in fact self - tuning . in section 4",
    "we compare a perturbative and a numerical method to solve the equations for the most general bulk potentials , and present an example for both methods using the exactly solvable cases of section 3 . in section 5",
    "we present a no - go theorem for self - tuning branes that would localize gravity without singularities . in section 6",
    "we comment on the effect of resolution of the singularities on self - tuning .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the 4d cosmological constant of branes coupled to scalar fields is generically self - tuned to zero , as in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the action for a brane coupled to gravity and a real scalar field ( such dilatonic domain walls have been extensively studied from a supersymmetric point of view @xcite , a new ingredient here is the localization of sm fields ) and the definition of the curvature in terms of the metric is such that a euclidean sphere has positive curvature .",

    "in addition , @xmath31 and @xmath44 must be continuous across the boundary . hence , there are four boundary conditions at the brane .",
    "a count of free parameters in the solutions to the equations of motion immediately demonstrates that given @xmath45 $ ] , the tension @xmath27 is generically not fine tuned .",
    "if we do not impose orbifold boundary conditions in addition to those above , then there are naively six free parameters : one from the solution on each side of the brane of each of equations - . however , one overall constant shift in @xmath44 is not relevant because @xmath44 enters into the equations of motion only through its derivatives .",
    "that leaves five free parameters and four boundary conditions .",
    "there is generically a ( finite ) line of solutions for a region of scalar - brane couplings @xmath26\\,t$ ] .",
    "once again , this is what we mean by self - tuning : given an arbitrary scalar - brane coupling @xmath26 $ ] ( possibly satisfying some constraints ) , there is a range of `` brane tensions '' @xmath27 such that static solutions exist . in the generic case ,",
    "as argued above , there is in fact a continuous set of static solutions for a given boundary condition specified by @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath26=f'[\\phi]$ ] then the range of @xmath27 often extends to infinity .",
    "the reason is that if @xmath32\\gg v[\\phi]$ ] asymptotically when @xmath46 is large , then @xmath47 there , and @xmath27 can be chosen arbitrarily large such that @xmath48 .",
    "orbifold boundary conditions are more constraining .",

    "however , continuity of @xmath44 and @xmath31 is then guaranteed .",
    "hence , in this case there are two free parameters ( there would be three but a constant shift in @xmath53 is not relevant ) and two boundary conditions , and there is generically a solution for a region of couplings @xmath26\\,t$ ] .",
    "thus , there is generically self - tuning in this case , as well .    in the absence of orbifold type boundary conditions ,",
    "if there are @xmath54 branes then there are @xmath55 free parameters and @xmath56 constraints , leaving @xmath57 free parameters in the solution for a given set of boundary conditions . hence , there can be up to two branes without fine - tuning . with orbifold boundary conditions , where image branes are included in @xmath54 and there is assumed to be a brane at the orbifold fixed point ( which contributes 1 to @xmath54 ) , there are @xmath58 free parameters and @xmath59 constraints , leaving @xmath60 free parameters in the solution .",
    "hence , only if there is a single brane at the orbifold fixed point will self - tuning occur .",
    "if the space is compactified on a circle with orbifold boundary conditions , then a parameter count for the case of branes at the two orbifold fixed points demonstrates that a fine - tuning is necessary in this case , as well @xcite .",
    "namely , there are two free parameters in the solution but four boundary conditions . in what follows we will concentrate on the case of a single brane coupled to a scalar field .",
    "in this section we study some special cases which were also partially discussed in @xcite .",

    "there are several important comments to make about this case , which is quite non - generic .",
    "first of all , the fact that a specific form had to be chosen for @xmath26 $ ] is a result of two non - generic features of the model : first , there is a symmetry @xmath91 . as a result of this symmetry , one of the free parameters , namely @xmath92 , does not appear on the left hand side of the boundary conditions for the derivatives @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , it turned out that the left hand sides of the two boundary conditions had the same form up to a sign .",
    "as a result , only @xmath95/f[\\phi]$ ] is relevant , and given one solution @xmath96 t , f'[\\phi]t)$ ] , there is an infinite set of solutions with the _ same _ @xmath26 $ ] and arbitrary @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that @xmath27 is completely arbitrary is most likely unique to the case of vanishing bulk potential .",
    "but the fact that given @xmath97 , self - tuning occurs for @xmath27 to within @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 is the expected standard model contribution to the tension ) is generic , and is what we mean by self - tuning .",
    "even given the constraint on @xmath26 $ ] from the shift symmetry in @xmath9 in this case , as explained in @xcite the required exponential form of @xmath26 $ ] might be natural from a stringy perspective where @xmath9 is interpreted as the dilaton .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in @xcite , the solutions with singularities on either side of the brane must be chosen in order to have a finite gravitational coupling ( assuming that the spacetime can be cutoff at the singularity in a consistent way ) .",
    "this feature will turn out to be generic except in theories which admit solitonic solutions for fine - tuned boundary conditions _",
    "i.e. _ for special discrete values of the brane tension .",
    "even though the case of a ( negative ) bulk cosmological constant can be studied without introducing a prepotential , we will present our method on this rather simple example before proceeding to the somewhat more complicated case of an exponential bulk potential in the next subsection .",
    "we will denote by @xmath62=\\lambda<0 $ ] the cosmological constant .",
    "the equations of motion are : @xmath100 the differential equation for the prepotential can be easily integrated , @xmath101 where @xmath73 is a constant of integration . plugging this expression for the prepotential into the remaining equations of motion , we obtain , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a constant of integration and another constant of integration , @xmath104 , also appears in the expression of the function @xmath105 defined , on the two different branches of solutions , by @xmath106 the nature of the solution depends on the sign of @xmath104 on each side of the brane . on the right ( left ) hand side",

    "if one imposes orbifold boundary conditions , then there are only half as many additional boundary conditions ( @xmath317 boundary conditions in all ) , but only @xmath318 free parameters . in either case",
    "the system is overconstrained .",
    "hence , a fine - tuning is required .",
    "although in the absence of a bulk potential the situation is modified because of the non - generic features mentioned above , in that case a fine - tuning at each of the singularities is required , as well .",
    "although the details of any continuation of the spacetime beyond the singularity will depend on quantum gravitational dynamics , we propose another scenario which does slightly better than the cut - off scenario , although fine - tuning will still be required .",
    "the singularities are generically horizons ( _ c.f",
    ". _ sections  [ sec : exp ] ) because the warp factor @xmath319 vanishes there .",
    "hence , light does not cross the horizon and we can imagine a scenario in which there are bulk fields living beyond the singularity , out of causal contact with our universe .",
    "the penrose diagram for this scenario is illustrated in figure  [ fig : penrose ] .",
    "however , the bulk fields across the horizon would provide an additional three free parameters which one might hope would help avoid fine - tuning .",
    "more precisely , following the counting in section  [ sec : self - tune ] , if there are orbifold boundary conditions , then there are @xmath315 free parameters from the bulk fields on both sides of the singularity , but @xmath320 boundary conditions . hence , although the system is less constrained than the case in which the spacetime is cut - off at the singularity , one fine - tuning is still required .",
    "one might suspect that additional fields would add additional degrees of freedom which could help in self - tuning .",
    "for example , the addition of a scalar field with second derivatives in its equation of motion would contribute two additional free parameters on each side of a brane , but only two boundary conditions ( continuity and change in the derivative at the brane ) . hence in a system of branes",
    "there are net , at least naively , two additional free parameters from the extra scalar field , which could be used to restore self - tuning at the singularities or perhaps even produce nonsingular solutions .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis is required in this case .",
    "we have studied brane worlds coupled to a scalar field and have found that self - tuning is a generic feature of these models . in these models the dynamics of the scalar field provides additional degrees of freedom , which generically alleviates the need for fine - tuning of static solutions .",
    "we have reexamined the exactly solvable models , two of which were studied previously @xcite , and have found that those case are more constrained than the generic case because of a shift symmetry in the scalar field in these models .",
    "still , these theories are self - tuning , including the case of an exponential potential . whereas in @xcite",
    "a fine - tuning was necessary in this case due to a particular ansatz for the scalar and graviton fields , we showed that the more general solution is not fine - tuned , in agreement with a counting of free parameters in these models .",
    "we demonstrated that singularities in the self - tuned solutions are generic if gravity is to be localized , and we presented a no - go theorem to this effect .",
    "we provided perturbative and numerical techniques in order to calculate the self - tuned solutions , and we illustrated the major points of the paper via several numerical examples .",
    "finally , we pointed out that the fine - tuning that is required in order to resolve the singularities in the spirit of @xcite for the case of zero bulk potential is generic .",
