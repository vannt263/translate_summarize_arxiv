    "this transition is understood as a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "on the one hand , their proposal implies that the entanglement entropy will serve as an order parameter for the phase transition : for @xmath180 , @xmath181 , while for @xmath182 , @xmath183 . on the other , at any finite @xmath24 , we have a system at finite volume for which there can be no phase transitions .",
    "the transition from @xmath184 at @xmath42 to @xmath43 at @xmath182 must be smooth .",
    "we conclude that the ryu - takayanagi formula is only valid in the strict large @xmath24 limit , but it would be nice to understand the form of the @xmath185 corrections . in principle , one should be able to compute the entanglement entropy for maximally supersymmetric yang - mills at weak coupling . in practice ,",
    "such a computation is substantially more difficult , and we instead considered a 1 + 1 dimensional massive scalar field on a circle at @xmath44 . morally , the regime @xmath186 should correspond to the confining regime of the yang - mills theory where the fields get a mass through their coupling to the curvature of the @xmath177 . for our scalar field , we argued that in the regime @xmath3 , the entanglement entropy difference scales as @xmath187 we conjecture that this type of scaling should be a generic feature of all gapped systems .",
