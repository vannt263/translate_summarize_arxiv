    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which are powered by accretion of mass onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the center of their host galaxies and/or the rotational energy of smbhs , are the most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe .",
    "they have also been of interest as powerful high - energy cosmic - ray accelerators ( crs ) , including ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "high - energy neutrinos from agn have been discussed since the late 70s at least  @xcite .",
    "if protons are accelerated by e.g. , the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism , because the optical and x - ray radiation density is rather high in the vicinity of a smbh , the crs may efficiently interact with the ambient photons .",
    "early models that attempted to interpret x - ray emission with pair cascades  @xcite led to very large diffuse neutrino intensities  @xcite . the x - ray origin is now thought to be comptonized disk emission  @xcite and the originally predicted fluxes have been largely constrained by neutrino observations themselves  @xcite .",
    "however , these early models motivated the searches for cosmic high - energy neutrinos with water- or ice - cherenkov detectors .",
    "both observational and theoretical multi - wavelength efforts have helped us understand the physics of agn , which also lead to different proposals for cr acceleration and associated neutrino production in agn .",
    "in particular , radio - loud agn and their on - axis objects `` blazars '' are most widely discussed as powerful non - thermal sources  @xcite .",
    "our gamma - ray view of blazars has been drastically enriched by egret on the _ _ compton gamma ray observatory _ _ , _ fermi _ , and various ground - based cherenkov telescopes .",
    "they are the dominant sources in the extragalactic gamma - ray sky  @xcite , which has tempted us to speculate that the radio - loud agn including blazars are powerful accelerators of protons as well as electrons  @xcite .",
    "the origin of gamma - ray emission is still under debate even in the _ fermi _ era .",
    "the standard explanation is inverse - compton emission by non - thermal electrons ( leptonic scenario )  @xcite , but lepto - hadronic scenarios have also been exploited to explain bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs )  @xcite , quasar - hosted galaxies ( qhbs ) including flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs )  @xcite , fanaroff - riley i ( fr i ) and fanaroff - riley ii ( fr ii ) radio galaxies  @xcite .",
    "a fraction of bl lacs , so - called extreme bl lacs , show very hard gamma - ray spectra , which could be explained by hadronic cascade emission induced by crs propagating in intergalactic space  @xcite .",
    "the icecube s discovery of cosmic high - energy neutrinos  @xcite raises new questions about the non - thermal properties of agn .",
    "is observed gamma - ray emission produced by high - energy crs accelerated in blazars and radio galaxies ?",
    "do agn make a dominant contribution to the observed diffuse neutrino intensity ?",
    "are they the sources of uhecrs ? in this article , we discuss possibilities of neutrino production in agn , with a focus on recent studies in light of the icecube data .",
    "agn , especially radio - loud agn , have been excellent targets of multi - wavelength observations .",
    "we will see that they are also promising targets of the multi - messenger astronomy .",
    "it is convenient to divide agn into radio - quiet and radio - loud agn . in the radio - loud objects ,",
    "the emission contribution from jets and bubbles or lobes is prominent especially at radio wavelengths . in the radio - quiet objects , the continuum emission comes from core regions within @xmath0 since jet and jet - related emission are weak .",
    "we first consider neutrino production in cr accelerators .",
    "the accelerators can be agn jets of radio - loud agn , or agn cores of both radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "next , we consider the fate of crs escaping from accelerators , and discuss neutrino production in cr reservoirs or during cr propagation .",
    "the diffuse neutrino intensity from extragalactic agn is given by  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the neutrino luminosity function of the sources ( per comoving volume per luminosity ) and @xmath3 is the maximum value of the redshift @xmath4 for a given source class . to make model predictions for the diffuse neutrino intensity , it is necessary to relate the calculated neutrino luminosity to the observed photon luminosity at some energy band .",
    "in addition , one needs to normalize the cr spectrum .",
    "it is ideal to calculate cr acceleration from first principles , but our present knowledge on particle acceleration is not sufficient .",
    "phenomenologically , the neutrino flux can be normalized by the observed cr data or by the existing gamma - ray data . or",
    ", one can introduce a phenomenological parameter such as the cr loading factor ( @xmath5 ) to represent the efficiency of cr proton acceleration .",
    "the most promising site of non - thermal agn emission is the jet of radio - loud agn ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "their broadband emission has been studied at multi - wavelengths from radio to gamma rays . in particular ,",
    "spectral energy distributions of blazars have been measured and modeled for many years .",
    "there are two main blazar sub - classes , namely bl lacs and qhbs ( mostly fsrqs ) .",
    "they differ mostly in their optical spectra , and fsrqs display strong broad emission lines , whereas bl lacs are characterized by optical spectra showing at most weak emission lines or absorption features .",
    "continuum radiation of both blazar classes ( fsrqs and bl lacs ) typically consists of two humps ( see the left panel of fig .  2 ) . the low - energy hump ( peaking in the infrared to soft x - ray band )",
    "is well explained by synchrotron radiation from non - thermal electrons .",
    "the high - energy hump is conventionally attributed to inverse - compton emission .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of high - energy - peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) are interpreted as synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton components .",
    "in contrast , those of low - energy - peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) and fsrqs are generally well fit with synchrotron and external inverse - compton components .",
    "external radiation fields are naturally provided by the accretion - disk radiation , its scattered radiation from the broadline region ( blr ) , and infrared ( ir ) radiation from the dust torus surrounding a smbh and the blr ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "typical quasars show such broad optical and uv emission lines from the blr , and the dust torus plays a key role in the agn unification scheme  @xcite .",

    "as an example , let us consider bl lacs , where external radiation fields are not relevant .",
    "as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 , neutrino spectra of bl lacs rise up to eev energies , and the peak energy is much higher than @xmath30  pev and the glashow resonance energy at 6.3  pev .",
    "second , @xmath29 is quite sensitive to @xmath17 .",
    "this is one of the reasons why blazar neutrino models have large uncertainties in their predictions for the normalization of the neutrino flux .",
    "next , we consider interactions with external photons provided by the blr clouds and the ir dust torus .",
    "the importance of blr photons and ir photons for the neutrino production has been studied by several authors  @xcite . for the calculation",
    ", one can use empirical relations between the blr / torus size and accretion - disk luminosity @xmath31  @xcite . then , assuming an isotropic distribution in the black hole rest frame , the photomeson production efficiency in the blr is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath32 above the pion production threshold energy , where @xmath33 is the covering factor and @xmath34 is the attenuation cross section of the photomeson production .",
    "similarly , the photomeson production efficiency for cr protons propagating in ir radiation fields supplied by the dust torus is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath35 above the pion production threshold energy .",
    "importantly , @xmath29 does not depend on @xmath17 and @xmath23 , which implies that the results on neutrino fluxes are much more insensitive to model parameters compared to the case of internal synchrotron target photon fields .",
    "the photomeson production with external radiation fields is important and should not be neglected for luminous blazars such as lbls and qhbs , leading to spectral bumps in the pev and eev range ( see the right panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "note that the accretion - disk emission is also important if @xmath36 .",
    "final results of the diffuse neutrino intensity depend on the neutrino luminosity function . it has been suggested that the spectral energy distributions of blazars evolve with luminosity , which is the so - called blazar sequence  @xcite ( see the left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "in the simple one - zone leptonic model , since @xmath29 increases with the observed photon luminosity , photohadronic interactions with broadline and ir emission in lbls and qhbs play an important role  @xcite . as a result , the neutrino spectrum is roughly expressed by @xmath37(e'_{p}l_{e'_p } ) \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll } { ( e'_{\\nu}/{e'}_{\\nu}^{b})}^{2 }   & \\mbox{(for $ e'_{\\nu } \\leqq { e'}_{\\nu}^{b}$ ) } \\\\ { ( e'_{\\nu}/{e'}_{\\nu}^{b})}^{2-s }   & \\mbox{(for $ { e'}_{\\nu}^{b } < e'_{\\nu}$ ) } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as shown in the right panel of fig .  2 ,",
    "the resulting neutrino spectra are quite hard above pev energies because of ir photons from the dust torus as well as internal synchrotron photons .",
    "one of the advantages of this simple model is that the results are not sensitive to details of the blazar sequence .",
    "this is because photohadronic interactions with external radiation fields are dominant , where @xmath29 is not sensitive to @xmath17 and @xmath23 .",
    "also , target photon fields have narrow distributions at uv and ir bands , so that predictions for the neutrino spectral shape are reasonably robust for a given cr spectrum .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 4 ) typically governs the neutrino spectral shape for hbls , where external fields are not relevant . even in such models ,",
    "as long as the cr spectrum extends to sufficiently high energies , pev - eev neutrino detections are crucial to test the models .    in general ,",
    "relating the neutrino luminosity to photon luminosity is model - dependent .",
    "for example , one can abandon the simple one - zone leptonic scenario for observed continuum spectra .",
    "instead , one can adopt lepto - hadronic scenarios , where gamma rays are attributed to proton synchrotron radiation or @xmath38-induced cascade emission , although huge cr luminosities are usually required  @xcite . in the lepto - hadronic scenarios ,",
    "the relationship between the neutrino and photon luminosities is different  @xcite .",
    "one of the appealing points is that the neutrino flux can be calibrated by the gamma - ray flux , and the diffuse gamma - ray intensity could be explained simultaneously with the diffuse neutrino intensity at @xmath30  pev  @xcite .    for comparison ,",
    "predictions of various blazar neutrino models are shown in the left panel of fig .  3 . except for an early hz97 model ,",
    "the models shown here lie in the range of the mid14 model with @xmath39 .",
    "one sees that a hard neutrino spectrum is a generic trend of the blazar neutrino models as long as a flat cr spectrum is used .",
    "it is possible to invoke a specific case that explains only neutrino events around pev energies  @xcite , but there remains a strong tension with the absence of glashow resonance events at 6.3  pev .",
    "( note that electron anti - neutrinos come from @xmath40s produced via higher resonances and multi - pion production . )",
    "an obvious solution to reduce this tension is to introduce a spectral cutoff in the cr spectrum .",
    "this might be realized if cr acceleration is caused by stochastic acceleration rather than shock acceleration  @xcite .",
    "explaining @xmath41  tev diffuse neutrinos is also possible by adopting a multi - zone emission model .",
    "one of the physically motivated models is the spine - sheath model for the agn jet structure  @xcite .",
    "the simple leptonic and lepto - hadronic scenarios of blazars have the problem that the predicted neutrino spectra are too hard to explain sub - pev events and have tensions with icecube upper limits above pev energies .",
    "also , models are being constrained by searches for extremely high - energy neutrinos above pev energies  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since blazars are rare objects , the absence of auto- and cross - correlation lead to strong constraints  @xcite , implying that their contribution to the diffuse neutrino intensity is sub - dominant especially below pev energies .    note",
    "that , even if blazars are not responsible for observed diffuse neutrinos , it does not mean that they are excluded as the main sources of uhecrs .",
    "based on the leptonic scenario , murase et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the diffuse neutrino intensity based on the hypothesis that uhecrs are produced in inner jets of radio - loud agn ( where uhecrs can be largely isotropized in bubbles , cocoons , lobes and large scale structures  @xcite ) .",
    "the expected diffuse neutrino intensity reaches @xmath42 at 100  pev energies .",
    "since values of @xmath29 for external radiation fields are more robust than those for internal radiation fields , the agn - uhecr hypothesis can be tested in this model .",
    "recently , it was claimed that a major outburst of the blazar pks b1424 - 418 occurred in temporal and spatial coincidence with the 2  pev neutrino event observed in icecube  @xcite .",
    "the probability for a chance coincidence is @xmath43% , so this can not be regarded as evidence for the blazar origin of icecube neutrinos .",

    "in addition , high - energy crs may also be accelerated at jet - cocoon boundaries , or hot spots , cocoon shocks , and radio lobes of fr ii radio galaxies . although they could even be relevant for uhecr production , the neutrino production there is usually inefficient  @xcite .",
    "both radio - loud agn and radio - quiet agn typically show x - ray emission . the cosmic x - ray background , which is much larger than the cosmic gamma - ray background , is known to be dominated by agn , especially seyfert galaxies .",
    "seyferts and quasars ( mostly radio - quiet agn ) show so - called blue bumps at the uv band , which are naturally explained as multi - color blackbody emission from geometrically - thin , optically - thick accretion disks  @xcite . on the other hand , hard x - ray emission",
    "is naturally explained as comptonized emission  @xcite by hot thermal electrons with @xmath50  k. it is believed that hot coronae are powered by the accretion disk via e.g. , magnetic reconnection .",
    "although the hadronic interpretation of the observed x - ray emission is disfavored by e.g. , the existence of a spectral cutoff in the spectrum , one may still consider possibilities of cr acceleration near the accretion disk .",
    "assuming the standard disk photon spectrum , the photomeson production efficiency for cr protons interacting with accretion - disk photons around the maximum disk temperature @xmath51 is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath52 thus , if crs can be accelerated , they are efficiently depleted and high - energy neutrinos should be produced .",
    "the typical accretion - disk temperature is @xmath53  ev , so the neutrino spectrum resulting from @xmath38 interactions with the accretion - disk photons is expected to have a peak at pev energies  @xcite .",

    "also , agn are not the only cr accelerators in this scenario .",
    "not only radio - loud agn but also radio - quiet agn , transients in galaxies ( such as supernovae and gamma - ray bursts ) can contribute to the resulting neutrino and gamma - ray intensities .",

    "@xcite attempted to explain the gamma - ray intensity as well as the observed uhecr intensity and diffuse neutrino intensities , assuming blazars without modeling the multi - messenger emission .",
    "however , as discussed above , main blazar emission itself is unlikely to be of @xmath47 origin .",
    "non - thermal emission from radio - loud agn including blazars is typically variable , which is most naturally attributed to inverse - compton or perhaps @xmath38-induced cascade or proton synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus , in these scenarios , a promising possibility would be that neutrino and gamma - ray emission are mainly produced in cr reservoirs containing radio - loud agn . in this model , gamma rays from galaxy clusters and groups contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background significantly  @xcite , and they are expected to be detected soon or have their emissivity constrained  @xcite .",
    "host galaxies may also be regarded as cr reservoirs  @xcite . however",
    ", powerful jets will leave their host galaxy , whereas weak jets or disk - driven winds from an agn lie in the galaxy .",
    "if crs are accelerated by these outflows and escape from the agn , they should interact with interstellar gas until they leave the galaxy .",
    "although hadronuclear production of neutrinos in radio galaxies is expected to be typically inefficient  @xcite , it can be important when agn co - exist with starburst galaxies  @xcite .",
    "crs escaping from agn further interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "the most famous example is the cosmogenic neutrino production by uhecrs interacting with the cmb  @xcite . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "4  @xcite , cosmogenic neutrinos are expected in the eev range , although the resulting neutrino intensity depends on the uhecr composition and redshift evolution of the sources .",
    "the matter density in intergalactic space is so small that @xmath47 interactions in cosmic voids are negligible .",
    "thus , for the production of pev neutrinos , interactions with the ebl in the uv range are relevant , and the photomeson production efficiency is estimated to be @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of ebl photons and @xmath68 is the particle travel distance . since the efficiency is tiny , for intergalactic neutrino production to be relevant , optimistic ebl models and large cr luminosity densities are required  @xcite . as in the blazar case",

    "most blazar neutrino models predicted hard neutrino spectra and the peak energy is expected in the 10 - 100  pev range .",

    "indeed , some models  @xcite predict that , in addition to whatever produces the icecube neutrinos , there might also be a low level of very - high - energy neutrinos from blazars that become prominent above a few pev energies . in my personal view , searches for @xmath69  pev ( or higher - energy )",
    "neutrinos with icecube , km3net , icecube - gen2  @xcite , ara  @xcite , arianna  @xcite and grand  @xcite , seem more interesting . improving sensitivities in this very - high - energy energy range will allow us to constrain a significant part of the parameter space of various blazar neutrino models .",
    "in particular , their connection to uhecrs can be critically examined .",
    "apparently , the observed diffuse neutrino intensity is compatible with the waxman - bahcall bound for a spectral index @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , in the blazar neutrino models , a flat cr spectrum leads to a hard neutrino spectrum since @xmath29 increases with energy , so the simultaneous explanation of the observed uhecr and neutrino intensities is difficult  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , steeper cr spectra might help .",
    "indeed , the observed diffuse neutrino intensity is also compatible with the nucleus - survival bound for a spectral index @xmath70  @xcite ( see the right panel of fig .  4 ) .",
    "note that , for blazars to produce uhecrs , the composition is expected to be heavier at ultrahigh energies .",
    "inner jets of fsrqs and fr ii galaxies could accelerate protons to @xmath71  ev .",
    "however , for such luminous blazars , the ir dust - torus component can deplete uhecr protons and neutrons  @xcite . since the photodisintegration cross section is higher , this is even the case for heavy nuclei .",
    "on the other hand , inner jets of bl lacs and fr i galaxies are not powerful enough to accelerate protons to @xmath71  ev  @xcite , especially in the leptonic model for gamma rays . as a result ,",
    "the agn - uhecr hypothesis in the simple model predicts that @xmath72  pev neutrinos large come from fsrqs while uhecrs come from bl lacs and fr i galaxies .",
    "not only radio - loud agn but also radio - quiet agn can be the sources of diffuse neutrinos . for seyferts and quasars , if crs are accelerated in the vicinity of a smbh , efficient @xmath38 interactions with uv and x - ray photons from the standard accretion disk and corona are expected .",
    "alternatively , ll agn associated with riafs have been considered as potential non - thermal particle emitters , and high - energy crs may be accelerated by turbulence or magnetic reconnection .",
    "although it is possible for the models to fit the icecube data , model uncertainties are quite large at present and further theoretical and observational studies may be needed .",
    "in contrast , cr reservoir scenarios have a strong predictive power . in this work , we discussed cr reservoir scenarios involving agn , which are different from the starburst model  @xcite .",
    "both radio - loud and radio - quiet agn embedded in such reservoirs may contribute to the observed diffuse neutrino intensity , and a spectral break due to cr diffusion was expected before icecube s discovery  @xcite . although a part of the parameter space has been constrained by multi - messenger data , it is appealing that the connection between observed crs above the second knee ( that may include uhecrs ) and pev neutrinos is expected in this model .",
    "the contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray background would be sub - dominant  @xcite .",
    "agn are widely considered as promising cr accelerators and neutrino sources . however , many problems related to their non - thermal activities remain unresolved .",
    "high - energy neutrinos have provided us with a new probe of the physics of agn , and detailed comparisons to various theoretical models have been made possible .",
    "i hope that further multi - messenger studies will help us solve some of the mysteries , especially the long - standing question whether agn are the sources of uhecrs .",
