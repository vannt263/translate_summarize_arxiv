    "hydrogen as a substitution for fossil fuel in applications of energy carrier has stimulated extensive research because of its abundance on earth and especially its clean outcome ( water ) .",
    "however , a safe and efficient hydrogen storage technique still remains as an obstacle in practice , in spite of various chemical and physical schemes proposed @xcite , in which hydrogen is stored in atomic and molecular forms , respectively . in this regards , metal - organic frameworks ( mofs ) was found to be a promising materials family for hydrogen storage based on physical adsorption .",
    "so far , a series of mofs has been synthesized and their structural properties and hydrogen loading under different temperatures and pressures have been investigated by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) techniques @xcite . compared with other schemes , mofs have several outstanding advantages , such as very large surface / volume ratio , tailorable chemical composition and structure , and the regular high - symmetry periodic crystal structure .",
    "mof-5 as the first one in the series has become a particular focus of mofs study  @xcite .",
    "it has been found experimentally that mof-5 with the cubic three - dimensional extended porous structure can achieve a gravimetric h@xmath0 capacity up to 4.5%wt at 78k @xcite",
    ". however , a common problem exists with mofs for hydrogen storage : around room temperature the h@xmath0 binding energy is still not large enough .",
    "how to increase the adsorption enthalpy to above 15 kj / mol @xcite under room temperature has become a challenge in practice , which may be possible by tailoring the chemical species and atomic structure . to achieve this goal we need to first gain a full understanding of h@xmath0 interaction with mof-5 on the different adsorption sites in the internal space of mof-5 .",
    "to accurately calculate these interactions is , however , a big challenge to theoretical studies because the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction plays an important role in the physisorption , which is a quantum dispersion force and is related to the nonlocal correlation effect .",
    "this nonlocal correlation is absent in the density functional theory ( dft ) and can only be described by the many - body perturbation theory or the correlated wavefunction methods .",
    "the lowest level of theory which can deal with the vdw interaction is the mller - plesset second - order perturbation ( mp2 ) theory @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated methods include the coupled - cluster method , such as the coupled - cluster singles and doubles and noniterative triples ( ccsd(t ) ) @xcite .",
    "these correlated quantum chemistry methods also face challenges for the study of hydrogen storage in mofs .",
    "first , these methods can not deal with periodic crystal structures .",
    "consequently , one has to use some fragment models cut out from the crystal structure to mimic the different parts of mofs @xcite .",
    "considering the long - range nature of the electrostatic and vdw forces present in the physisorption , whether and to what extent these fragment models can represent the behavior of the crystal is a question to answer .",
    "these correlated methods are also computationally very demanding and can not deal with large fragment models .",
    "furthermore , as usually implemented with the gaussian basis functions , these methods have a strong basis set dependence and , therefore , the result becomes reliable only when a very large basis set is used or some elaborate correction techniques are applied @xcite .    to simply add empirically a @xmath1 term to conventional dft calculations , as did in the dft+dispersion ( dft+d ) method @xcite , may be a solution for studying the h@xmath0 adsorption in the full crystal structure , but its accuracy and reliability of result still needs to be examined @xcite . on the other hand , in the vdw - df method developed by dion _",
    "_ @xcite the vdw interaction can be included perturbatively in a seamless fashion into an first - principles kohn - sham dft calculation .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the correlation energy to the second order in terms of a carefully chosen quantity for the long - range part of the correlation functional .",
    "this method has been applied to different separational systems @xcite and shown reasonable accuracy . for the extended crystal structure of mofs interacting with h@xmath0 , whether and to what extent the binding energy can be determined by the vdw - df method has not been studied in the literature , to our best knowledge .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt the vdw - df method to study systematically the binding energy of h@xmath0 in mof-5 crystal for two major adsorption sites .",
    "we first test the accuracy of the methodology by considering the fragment models already studied in the literature .",
    "the comparison with the mp2 , ccsd(t ) , and dft+d calculations shows a good accuracy which is better than the empirical dft+d method .",
    "calculations for the full crystal structure , however , show that these fragment models can not represent well the hydrogen - storage property of the crystal due to the long - range interaction of h@xmath0 with the environment . besides the single h@xmath0 binding behavior , multiple h@xmath0 adsorption is also considered to investigate the effect of h@xmath0 density . furthermore , to illustrate the possibility of enhancing the average h@xmath0 binding energy in mof-5 crystal , we consider the substitution of f atoms for the h atoms of the organic linker part . it is found that in this way the h@xmath0 binding energy can be almost doubled due to the extra electrostatic interaction , indicating a possible way to improve the performance of mofs for hydrogen storage .",

    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "the lattice constant and the average binding energy per h@xmath0 for difference h@xmath0 densities are listed in table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "one can see that when the number of h@xmath0 adsorbed in the primitive cell increases , the lattice constant actually decreases a little bit ( by 0.02  ) and the binding energy also decreases by 0.34 kj / mol and 0.36 kj / mol for the p(c ) and p(l ) , respectively .",
    "this small decrease of the lattice constant implies that there exists an attractive force among the adsorbed h@xmath0 molecules , which increases with the increaseing h@xmath0 density .",
    "this behavior is different from the case of chemisorption where an increase in adsorbate density will usually lead to an expansion of the volume . for the highest h@xmath0 density considered in the present work , the smallest h@xmath0 ... h@xmath0 distance is around 4.1 which is quite close to that in the bulk h@xmath0 solid ( 3.8  ) @xcite . for even higher h@xmath0 density comparable to that in the solid state , a previous calculation by yildirim _",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that a unique three - dimensional interlinked h@xmath0 nanocage will be formed , which will enhance further the interaction among the h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "since the attraction among the h@xmath0 molecules is in the opposite direction to their binding to the mof-5 crystall , it reduces the binding energy consequently .    as a comparison to the crystall case",
    ", we also check the multiple h@xmath0 effect using the fragment models .",
    "as shown in table  [ table:2 ] , for the corner model , when the four cup sites are occupied by h@xmath0 , the average binding energy actually increases by 0.1 kj / mol compared to the case of only one h@xmath0 adsorbed . for the bdc model , this change is much smaller but is still increased ( by 0.01 kj / mol ) with h@xmath0 adaorbed on both sides of the benzene ring compared to only on one side .",
    "this qualitative difference between the crystall and the fragment models for multiple h@xmath0 adsorption can be understood by considering the fact that in the fragment models the h@xmath0 molecules are adsorbed only on the surface of the cluster , and therefore , the interlink between h@xmath0 molecules adsorbed in a cage of the crystall structure is absent . in this case ,",
    "when multiple h@xmath0 molecules are adsorbed the synergistic effect of electrostatic and vdw forces leads to the small increase of the binding energy .",
    "thus , our calculation shows that , compared to the true crystall stucture , the fragment models not only underestimates the binding energy when a single h@xmath0 molecule is adsorbed but also give an opposite trend of the binding energy when multiple h@xmath0 molecules are adsorbed .",
    "another important effect of multiple h@xmath0 adsorption is an perpendicular - to - parallel rotation of the h@xmath0 molecules adsorbed on the cup site : when only one h@xmath0 is adsorbed , it prefers to be perpendicular to the c@xmath4 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8](a ) ) .",
    "however , when multiple h@xmath0 molecules are adsorbed on the cup site , their adsorption configuration will undergo an perpendicular - to - parallel transition and becomes parallel to the c@xmath4 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8](b ) ) .",
    "this transition reflects the interaction between the h@xmath0 molecules adsorbed on the same corner unit .",
    "as is already shown , the h@xmath0 binding energy with the organic linker is significantly smaller than with the metal oxide corner , which largely limits the h@xmath0 loading for hydrogen storage application .",
    "the reason is that the electrostatic force coming from the ozn@xmath3 cluster is much stronger than the vdw force coming from the organic linker .",
    "this implies a way for improving the average binding energy of h@xmath0 molecules in the mof-5 crystall : it may be achieved by creating extra polarization in the organic linker part and therefore enhancing the binding energy by the induced electrostatic force .",
    "here we consider a possibility that the 4 hydrogen atoms of an organic linker are replaced with 4 fluorine atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) which have a much stronger electronegativity leading to a larger charge transfer and , therefore , will give rise to extra polarization .",
    "fluorine atom has also a small mass for a good gravimetric hydrogen loading .",
    "the results of binding energy after the fluorine substitution are also given in table .",
    "[ table:2 ] ( f - p(c)+h@xmath0 and f - p(l)+h@xmath0 ) .",
    "one can see that for one h@xmath0 adsorbed on the cup site the binding energy increases slightly from 9.39 kj / mol to 9.82 kj / mol .",
    "however , for one h@xmath0 adsorbed on the linker site the binding energy is enhanced significantly from 5.50 kj / mol to 10.39 kj / mol which is now even larger than the binding energy with the corner , showing that the proposed extra electrostatic interaction is really working .",
    "this result casts a light on possible ways for improving the performance of mofs for hydrogen storage .",
    "by using the vdw - df method implemented with plane - wave basis functions we have investigated systematically the physisorption of hydrogen molecules in mof-5 crystall as used for hydrogen storage .",
    "we first examed the accuracy of this methodology by comparing the results for three framgent models to those from the correlated quantum chemistry methods , ccsd(t ) and mp2 , as well as from the dft+d method .",
    "good accuracy was found , which is comparable to that of the ccsd(t ) and mp2 with very large basis sets . by comparing the results for the fragment modes with those for the true crystall structure we have shown that the fragment models underestimate largely the binding energy and therefore can not represent well the hydrogen - storage property of the crystall which , however , can not be dealt with by the quantum chemistry methods . for many hydrogen molecules adsorbed",
    ", the fragment models even give an opposite trend of the binding energy .",
    "our calculations for the true crystall structure show that the binding energy with the metal oxide corner is significantly larger than with the organic linker due to the metal ion - induced electrostatic force . with many hydrogen molecules",
    "adsorbed the crystall volume and the average binding energy decrease a little bit because of the small attraction among the hydrogen molecules , which leads to the regular interlinked h@xmath0 nanocage structure for higher h@xmath0 density found previously . for many hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the corner",
    "they undergo a perpendicular - to - parallel transition and prefer to be parallel to the c@xmath4 plane .",
    "the present work shows that the much weaker binding with the organic linker can be improved significantly by introducing extra polarization and the resulting electrostatic interaction : the substitution of f atoms for the h atoms can increase the binding energy from 5.50 kj / mol to 10.39 kj / mol which is now very close to the binding energy with the corner .",
