    "the statistical properties of dissipative systems have created considerable attention from the view point of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . the analysis of gas kinetics has played an important role in the construction of statistical mechanics .",
    "similarly , granular gases which are collections of inelastic particles@xcite are expected to be important to understand non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of dissipative systems . to understand the statistical properties of dissipative systems ,",
    "several attempts have been carried out on a collection of inelastic particles .",
    "the simplest model of granular gases is an inelastic hard core model . to analyze the time evolution of the velocity distribution function ( vdf )",
    ", we usually adopt the inelastic boltzmann equation which is a generalization of the boltzmann equation to the case of inelastic gases .",
    "there have been several investigations on vdf of the inelastic gas by the inelastic boltzmann equation.@xcite the approximate analytical solution of the inelastic boltzmann equation has been obtained by the method of expansion by the sonine polynomial which is known as a fast convergent one and becomes standard technique to describe both non - uniform elastic gases and uniform inelastic gas systems@xcite .",
    "they also suggested that the scaled vdf of the inelastic boltzmann equation has an exponential high energy tail@xcite , which has been confirmed by the direct simulation monte carlo method ( dsmc)@xcite or in molecular dynamics simulations of smooth hard inelastic disks in the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs)@xcite . on the other hand , some investigations on the spatial structure of the inelastic boltzmann gas system have been performed@xcite .",
    "esipov and p@xmath0schel@xcite have suggested that the diffusion length of particles obeys a power of a logarithmic function of time .",
    "brey et al.@xcite have derived the self - diffusion coefficient by means of a chapmann - enskog expansion in the density gradient of the particles in the inelastic boltzmann gas system .",
    "chen et al.@xcite have shown in the molecular dynamics simulation of sticky inelastic particles that the probability density function of inelastic particles obeys an exponential distribution at late stages .",
    "there is , however , a strong restriction in the applicability of the inelastic boltzmann equation and the method of the sonine expansion .",
    "inelastic collisions generate string - like clusters in a cooling state which sometimes reaches an inelastic collapse state .",
    "thus , hcs can not be kept in general @xcite .",
    "thus , both of the inelastic boltzmann equation and the method of the sonine expansion which are only valid in dilute hcs@xcite become no longer valid as time goes on@xcite .    on the other hand , the inelastic scatterings of classical electrons by ions can be modeled by the inelastic lorentz gas@xcite in which few fraction of particles can move freely among many immobile scatters known as drude s formula.@xcite since the fixed scatters keep their initial configuration , the system can keep the state of dilute mobile particles if the initial configuration is dilute .",
    "furthermore , there are some examples of the inelastic lorentz gas in the natural phenomena such as the spontaneous interparticle percolation.@xcite the lorentz gas is also familiar in dairy life such as the pedestrian motion among a cloud of persons and obstacles , the pachinko game and the pinball game@xcite etc .",
    "there is an additional advantage that the analysis of the inelastic lorentz gas model is easier than that of the inelastic boltzmann equation because the inelastic lorentz gas model treats the one - body problem : the situation of lorentz gas is dilute mobile particles among almost immobile scatters , while boltzmann gas is a collection of mobile particles .",
    "we believe that the systematic studies of the inelastic lorentz gas system is also needed .",
    "the steady vdf of inelastic lorentz gas and its percolation velocity under the uniform external field have been analyzed.@xcite however , there have been no efforts to investigate the spatial structure of the inelastic lorentz gas system without external field .",
    "it is important to discuss the spatial structure of the inelastic lorentz gas without any external field as the first step of the study of the inelastic lorentz gas system .",
    "thus , we intend to investigate the spatial structure of the inelastic lorentz gas in cooling state in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in @xmath1 2 , we introduce the model of our simulation . in @xmath1 3 , we validate our simulation code by evaluating the mean square displacement , the velocity distribution and the position distribution in elastic collisions . we also explain the main results of our simulation and analysis for the mean square displacement and the position distribution of the inelastic lorentz gas in @xmath1 3 .",
    "we conclude our results in @xmath1 4 .",
    "in our simulation we adopt the event driven method for hard core collision of particles.@xcite the system consists of 40000 fixed smooth hard disks , that is 40000 scatters , and one tracer disk .",
    "the collision between the tracer and the scatters is inelastic hard core collision with a constant coefficient of restitution @xmath2 . through our simulation",
    ", we use dimensionless quantities in which the scales of length and velocity are respectively measured by the diameter of the disks @xmath3 and the standard deviation of the initial velocity distribution @xmath4 .",
    "namely , both of all the scatters and the tracer are circular disks with their diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the number density of the scatters in this system is @xmath5 , where the system size is @xmath6 .",
    "because the area fraction is approximately @xmath7 , the system of our simulation is dilute enough .",
    "we adopt the periodic boundary condition in this system .",
    "the system size is enough large to remove the boundary effect of this system , because the tracer is localized and have rarely gone across the boundaries .",
    "we average each result over 10000 samples which consist of 100 different initial configurations of the scatters and 100 different initial velocities of the tracer .",
    "each initial configuration of the scatters is at random .",
    "each tracer starts from the center of the system and its distribution of the initial velocities is made from normal random numbers , where its average is zero and its standard deviation is @xmath4 .",
    "each sample has been calculated until 100 inelastic collisions .    in each inelastic collision , the velocity of a tracer tangential to the collision plane are preserved , while the velocity normal to it changes with the restitution coefficient @xmath2 which is assumed to be a constant for all the collisions .",
    "the precollision velocity of the tracer @xmath8 yields the postcollision velocity of it @xmath9 with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a unit vector pointing from the center of the scatter to the center of the tracer ( fig.[collision ] ) .",
    "thus , the expression is given by @xmath12 this relation between the precollision velocity and the postcollision velocity in the inelastic lorentz gas system is quite different from that in the inelastic boltzmann gas system .    in the simulation of the inelastic lorentz gas ,",
    "the velocity of the tracer quickly decreases . for the sake of long time simulation",
    ", we adopt the rescaling of the speed of the tracer as follows . after each collision",
    ", the magnitude of the postcollision velocity @xmath13 has been put to that of the precollision velocity @xmath14 , i.e. the magnitude of the initial velocity of the tracer has been preserved for all the collisions in each sample . note that we use non - scaled values of @xmath9 the magnitude of which decreases by collisions for our analysis .",
    "now , we explain the main results of our simulation and analysis for inelastic lorentz gas .",
    "we study the mean square displacement and the position distribution of the tracer .",
    "our simulation code has been validated by the test simulation in which we have evaluated the mean square displacement , the velocity distribution and the position distribution of the tracer in the elastic collisions , i.e. @xmath15 . for elastic scatters , we expect that the tracer displays random walk motion when the initial speeds of the tracer are identical and that the gaussian is the stable velocity distribution .",
    "corresponding to a random walk model , we have fixed the magnitudes of 100 different initial velocities of the tracer , i.e. @xmath16 . in each sample",
    ", we calculate the motion of tracer until 10000 elastic collisions .",
    "the other conditions of the test simulation are same as those of the simulation in inelastic collisions .",
    "we have checked that the mean square displacement of the tracer @xmath17 is almost a linear function of time , where @xmath18 indicates the average over the 10000 samples .",
    "we also confirm that all the data of the position distribution @xmath19 can be scaled as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scaled position distribution function and @xmath22 is the scaled distance from the center of the system at which the tracer started .",
    "we check that the scaled position distribution @xmath21 is almost on the gaussian curve as expected from the conventional random walk .",
    "furthermore , the velocity distribution of the tracer becomes almost the gaussian .",
    "let us discuss the statistical properties of inelastic lorentz gas .",
    "at first , we evaluate the time evolution of the thermal velocity and discuss the mean square displacement in the inelastic system .    in the inelastic lorentz gas system , many inelastic collisions happen at random .",
    "the average number of collision times per unit time is evaluated as @xmath23 , where @xmath3 is the diameter of the tracer and the scatters and @xmath24 is the number density of the scatters .",
    "the thermal velocity @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 with the velocity distribution of the tracer @xmath27 and the average density of the tracer @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the temperature of the system is denoted as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of the tracer.@xcite    in each collision , the energy loss of the tracer is considered to be proportional to the temperature of the system @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we can estimate the energy loss of the tracer per unit time as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless function of the restitution coefficient @xmath2 .",

    "all the data are on the same straight line which is also shown in fig.[v0re ] . corresponding to the results of our simulation , we set the number density of the scatters @xmath43 and the initial thermal velocity @xmath44 from eq.([v0defi ] ) .",
    "thus , fig.[v0re ] indicates that @xmath45 is a linear function of the restitution coefficient @xmath2 as @xmath46 whereas martin and piasecki@xcite have assumed energy losses at collisions in inelastic lorentz gas system are proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "this haff s law , @xmath47 , can be derived from the gaussian vdf .",
    "we will demonstrate that the cooling rate of the inelastic lorentz gas system is not proportional to @xmath38 and close to eq.([hsimu ] ) in terms of non - gaussian nature of vdf as follows .",
    "the time evolution of vdf for inelastic lorentz gas without any external field is in general described by a rate equation . for elastic gases ,",
    "the rate equation is known as the boltzmann equation .",

    "there are no significant differences between @xmath62 and @xmath61 , though @xmath60 does not exist in the high inelastic region .",
    "this means that haff s law , @xmath47 , may be replaced by eq.([hsimu ] ) in the inelastic lorentz gas system as a result of non - gaussian nature .",
    "now , let us discuss the statistical properties of the inelastic lorentz gas based on a random walk model .",
    "to simplify the expressions , we introduce @xmath63 and @xmath64 as , @xmath65 using @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the average time interval @xmath66 from @xmath67th collision to @xmath68th collision between the tracer and the scatters is given as , @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the mean free path of the tracer , and @xmath71 is the total time until the @xmath67th collision . from the relation @xmath72",

    "if we assume that the inelastic lorentz gas system corresponds to the random walk system with the reduction of hopping velocity , the effect of inelasticities can be absorbed in the number of collisions @xmath68 .",

    "the reason why eq.([msd ] ) deviates a little from the data of our simulation in the early time region in fig.[msdtheory ] is that few collisions have happened in this region .      in the inelastic lorentz gas system ,",

    "however , it has been also demonstrated that the sonine expansion diverges if the inelasticity is high in the inelastic boltzmann gas system.@xcite solutions by the sonine expansion can not express the definite exponential form in the high energy tail , because the expression of eq.([sonine1 ] ) does not have terms of odd power of @xmath175 , while the definite exponential form contains odd power of @xmath175 .",

    "6 is rationalized by the insufficiency of the number of the samples in our simulation .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the scaled vdf is not essential for the exponential tail of the scaled position distribution function of the tracer , while it is essential for the fact that the cooling rate is not proportional to @xmath177 but close to @xmath178 .",
    "however , the cooling rate is almost proportional to @xmath177 in the inelastic boltzmann system in which the scaled vdf is non - gaussian .",
    "the difference is considered to be due to the difference between one - body problem and many - body problem , i.e. the collision relation between precollision velocity and postcollision velocity of the inelastic lorentz gas system is quite different from that of the inelastic boltzmann gas system and the mean free time of the inelastic lorentz gas system also shows different dependence on time from that of the inelastic boltzmann gas system .",
