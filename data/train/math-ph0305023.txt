    "the problem of random walks on finite lattices is fundamental to the theory of stochastic processes @xcite and has numerous applications including potential theory @xcite , electrical networks @xcite , atomic surface diffusion @xcite and diffusion on biological membranes @xcite . a classic problem in this area , which was posed by courant _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in 1928 , concerns random walks on finite planar lattices with a single source and absorbing boundaries .",
    "the exact solution for this problem on the square lattice was derived in 1940 @xcite .",
    "the exact solution on the triangular lattice was only obtained recently @xcite after having been considered intractable @xcite .",
    "other variants of the problem on the square lattice have also been solved exactly @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider random walks from a single source on a finite lattice which incorporates periodic boundary conditions in one direction but absorbing boundary conditions in the other .",
    "diffusion thus occurs on a surface with the topology of a lattice tube with absorbing sites at the ends .",
    "we present explicit results for each of the three regular lattice types ; square , triangular and honeycomb .",
    "our results include a bias parameter that can be adjusted away from unity to model different random walk probabilities in the cyclic direction around the tube compared with the axial direction along the tube .",
    "this parameter can be adjusted to model the effect of surface curvature , and other types of strain , on the surface diffusion .",
    "our derivations generalize the approach developed by mccrea and whipple @xcite for planar square lattice random walks with absorbing boundaries .",
    "this is straightforward in the case of the square lattice tube however special care has to be exercised in an appropriate choice of co - ordinates in the case of the triangular lattice tube and the honeycomb lattice tube .",
    "there are two important motivations for our study .",
    "one of the motivations is to add to the rather small class of exactly solvable random walk lattice problems with absorbing boundaries , since it is still the case that : `` explicit solutions are known in only a few cases '' @xcite .",
    "the second motivation is that the mathematics of discrete lattice diffusion problems may find applications in the recently realized laboratory assembly of lattice nanostructures ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "for example our problem of random walks on the triangular lattice tube and the honeycomb lattice tube represent models for adatom diffusion on single walled zig - zag carbon nano - tubes @xcite with open ends ",
    "the random walks on the triangular lattice tube model adatom diffusion across carbon - carbon bonds and the random walks on the honeycomb lattice tube model diffusion along the carbon - carbon bonds .",
    "the diffusion of carbon adatoms along the carbon - carbon bonds of a carbon nanotube plays a vital role in stabilizing and maintaining the open edge growth of nanotubes @xcite .",
    "our exact results complement related results for diffusion on carbon nano - tubes based on i ) enumeration of random walks up to a set length @xcite and ii ) microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is divided into separate sections for square lattice tubes , triangular lattice tubes , honeycomb lattice tubes , and a section containing an example and discussion .",
    "consider the standard square lattice co - ordinates @xmath0 representing the intersections of equidistant vertical straight lines and equidistant horizontal straight lines .",
    "the expectation that a random walk starting from a site @xmath1 visits a site @xmath0 , distinct from @xmath1 , before being absorbed at a finite boundary site is given by the homogeneous partial difference equation @xmath2.\\label{sh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath3 allows for different probabilities for walks around the tube compared with walks along the tube . to accommodate the source term at @xmath1 we construct separate solutions ; @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the expectation that a random walk starting from @xmath1 visits a site @xmath8 , not necessarily distinct from @xmath1 , before being absorbed at a finite boundary is then given by the inhomogeneous partial difference equation @xmath9.\\label{si}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above difference equations are to be solved with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath10 co - ordinates , @xmath11 absorbing boundary conditions in the @xmath12 co - ordinates , @xmath13 and matching conditions at @xmath14 , ie . , @xmath15    the method of solving inhomogeneous linear partial difference boundary value problems as above consists of two parts @xcite .",
    "first obtain the general separation of variables solution to the homogeneous problem , then find an appropriate linear combination of such solutions to satisfy the boundary conditions and the inhomogeneous problem .",
    "a major difficulty in these problems can be the identification of a lattice co - ordinate system with a separation of variables solution that can be matched with the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous field equations for the square lattice , eq.([sh ] ) , admit the separable solution @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the separation constant .",
    "these separated equations have general solutions @xmath19 where @xmath20 if @xmath21 then the solutions are no longer provided by eqs .",
    "( [ sph ] ) and ( [ sqh ] ) . in this case",
    "we have the solutions @xmath22 the special solutions in eqs.([sph ] ) and ( [ sqh ] ) do not appear in the planar lattice problems because they can not satisfy absorbing boundary conditions in both @xmath10 and @xmath12 co - ordinates .    with suitable linear combinations of the above solutions , eqs.([sph]),([sqh]),([sph]),([sqh ] ) , we find that the general solutions to the homogeneous problem that also satisfy the boundary conditions , eqs.([sbc1]),([sbc2 ] ) , and the matching condition , eq.([sm ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath23\\\\ f_{ii}(p , q)&=&cb(q - n-1))+\\sum_{k=1}^m ( a_k e^{i\\alpha_k p}+b_k e^{-i\\alpha_k p})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\times \\sinh[\\beta_k(q - n-1)]\\sinh(\\beta_k b)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25    the constants @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are now determined by the requirement that the solutions satisfy the inhomogeneous equation , eq.([si ] ) .",
    "this step is facilitated using the identity in eq.([bet ] ) together with the identity in eq.([a1 ] ) and the kronecker delta identity @xmath29 re - arranged as @xmath30 we thereby obtain the following solutions for the expectations that a random walk will visit a site @xmath0 before being absorbed at an end site : @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\frac{\\sinh[\\beta_k(n+1-b)]\\sinh(\\beta_k q)}{\\sinh(\\beta_k)\\sinh[\\beta_k(n+1)]},\\label{ss1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\frac{\\sinh[\\beta_k(n+1-q)]\\sinh(\\beta_k b)}{\\sinh(\\beta_k)\\sinh[\\beta_k(n+1)]},\\label{ss2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 dependent on @xmath34 through eqs.([alp]),([bet ] ) .",
    "the absorption probabilities @xmath35 are readily evaluated from @xmath36 it is a simple matter to show that @xmath37 and @xmath38 so that @xmath39=1.\\ ] ]",
    "to obtain the solution for triangular lattice tubes we consider the lattice co - ordinates @xmath0 shown in figure 1 .",
    "this co - ordinate system describes two independent triangular lattice systems , only one of which can be accessed by a random walk from a single point source . in figure 1 the sites that are accessible from the source site at @xmath1 are indicated by filled circles .",
    "the nearest neighbour sites to the source are highlighted by open circles in this figure .",
    "the lattice sites that are not accessible from the source are referred to as the zero mesh @xcite .",
    "the same co - ordinate system has been used to find an approximate solution to the planar triangular lattice problem with absorbing boundaries @xcite however a different zig - zag co - ordinate system was required to find the exact solution @xcite . in the case of the planar triangular lattice problem",
    "the co - ordinate system in figure 1 allows the leakage of random walks from sites at @xmath40 and @xmath41 to sites at @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , which are outside the absorbing boundaries at @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the triangular lattice tube",
    "this leakage is prevented because the @xmath10 co - ordinate is cyclic .",

    ", we might first anticipate rapid diffusion along the tube axis however the tower like plot in figure 4(c ) reveals that this is not the case .",
    "the random walk becomes trapped locally near the source as it moves back and forward between the source site and the nearest neighbour to the source .",
    "this effect is indeed a simple consequence of the honeycomb lattice geometry which has only one nearest neighbour along the axis direction .",
    "a further interesting calculation is the steady state profile for expectation values along the lattice tube after summation over @xmath10 .",

    "explicit expressions for this slope as a function of @xmath3 can be readily evaluated from the formulae for the expectation values given in eqs ( 54)-(57 ) .",
    "for example for @xmath5 we have @xmath108 it is clear from this equation that the slope diverges as @xmath109 and as @xmath110 .",
    "for the example considered here with @xmath111 and @xmath112 we have @xmath113 and the slope is a minimum at @xmath114 .",
    "the geometry of the honeycomb lattice tube that we have considered in this paper is equivalent to that of a single walled zig - zag carbon nanotube with open ends .",
    "the above example corresponds to the ( 9,0 ) nanotube in the standard notation @xcite .",
    "the bias parameter could thus be tuned to model the effects of strain , such as surface curvature , on diffusion of adatoms along the carbon - carbon bonds on zig - zag carbon nano - tubes .",
    "an interesting result in this connection ( as shown in figure 4(c ) above ) is that a random walk could be localized for a period of time by applying a uniform strain which favours diffusion in the direction of all bonds aligned with the tube axis .",
