    "( the selection of works cited is necessarily quite limited . )",
    "the development of slater s `` new '' dynamical approach to classical unimolecular dissociation rates @xcite was followed by thiele s general formulation of the problem , which emphasized the dynamical significance of the distribution of gap times ( see below ) @xcite . as we show below , thiele s",
    "work has proved to be remarkably prescient in terms of its identification of the appropriate phase space structures involved in unimolecular reaction dynamics . following thiele s work , a large number of computational ( trajectory ) investigations of lifetime / gap time distributions",
    "have been undertaken ( see , for example , results discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "dumont and brumer @xcite and dumont @xcite have analysed unimolecular reaction rates in terms of the gap time distribution , while related work has been done on the so - called classical spectral theorem @xcite .    a fundamental assumption of the statistical theory of ( classical )",
    "unimolecular decay is that intramolecular vibrational energy distribution ( ivr ) occurs on a timescale much faster than that for reaction @xcite .",
    "renewed interest in the problem therefore naturally stemmed from investigations of the properties of molecular vibrational dynamics , modelled as nonlinearly coupled anharmonic oscillators , in light of the kam theorem and the apparent existence of a threshold energy for onset of global chaos @xcite .",
    "the central role of deterministic chaos itself in determining the validity of statistical approaches to reaction rates , as well as possible quantum manifestations of classical nonintegrable behavior @xcite , has received much attention @xcite , most recently in the context of quantum control @xcite .",
    "the possibility of mode - specific chemistry also stimulated much work on the relation between intramolecular dynamics and non - statistical reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "several examples of non - rrkm effects in thermal reactions of medium - sized organic molecules have been found in recent years @xcite , while a detailed discussion of possible non - rrkm effects in one particular reaction , the unimolecular dissociation of @xmath2 , has been given @xcite .",
    "advances in the classical theory of chemical reaction rates have been closely linked to improvements in our understanding of the phase space structure of hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "both conceptually and in practice it is important to distinguish between systems with 2 degrees of freedom ( dof ) and multimode ( @xmath3 dof ) systems .    for 2 dof systems described by standard kinetic plus potential hamiltonians , periodic orbit dividing surfaces ( pods ; that is , dividing surfaces in configuration space obtained by projection of a periodic orbit from phase space )",
    "were shown to have the property of minimal flux ( as a consequence of the principle of stationary action ) and to be ( locally ) surfaces of no return ( the velocity vector is nowhere tangent to the configuration space projection of the periodic orbit ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the pods therefore provide a rigorous realization of the concept of the transition state @xcite .",
    "( pods have also been defined for 2 dof systems lacking time - reversal symmetry @xcite . )",
    "correlations between features of the classical phase space structure and the behavior of the computed reactive flux @xcite were explored relatively early on for 2 dof systems by deleon and berne @xcite .",
    "important theoretical advances were subsequently made relating non - statistical behavior to molecular phase space structure @xcite , in particular the existence of intramolecular bottlenecks to energy transfer @xcite , broken separatrices @xcite , and reactive islands and cylinders @xcite .",
    "the multimode case remains less thoroughly explored and understood .",
    "methods for defining approximate intramolecular bottlenecks and reactive dividing surfaces have been devised @xcite .",
    "although the arnold web of resonances provides a useful framework for mapping and analyzing evolution of phase points in near - integrable multimode systems @xcite , so - called `` arnold diffusion '' @xcite has become a convenient but often ill - defined catchall term employed to describe a variety of possibly distinct phase space transport mechanisms in @xmath3 dof systems @xcite .",

    "the stable and unstable manifolds associated with nhims define codimension - one dividing surfaces @xcite on the constant energy manifold @xcite , and so are possible candidates for reactive separatrices , while the nhims themselves define phase space transition states @xcite .",
    "some early attempts were made to compute and visualize such manifolds in a 3 dof system describing surface diffusion of atoms @xcite and for a 4d symplectic mapping modelling the dissociation of a van der waals complex @xcite .",
    "as discussed in more detail below , based on the notion of the nhim and on the development of efficient algorithms for computing normal forms at saddles , there has been significant recent progress in the development and implementation of phase space transition state theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the problem of defining and evaluating theoretical unimolecular reaction rates in light of the penetrating analyses of thiele @xcite , dumont and brumer @xcite , and deleon and berne @xcite , the classical spectral theorem @xcite , and the recent developments in phase space transition state theory @xcite mentioned above .",

    "one measure of the rate at which trajectories leave a region of the energy surface is given by the ( magnitude of the ) flux of trajectories leaving that region ( units of energy surface volume / time ) divided by the energy surface volume of initial conditions in that region _ corresponding to trajectories that will eventually leave the region_. this rate is just the inverse of the mean passage or gap time @xcite .",
    "hence , to compute this rate at fixed energy one must first ( 1 ) define the region of reactants , then ( 2 ) compute the flux of trajectories exiting this region and , finally , ( 3 ) compute the volume of the energy surface corresponding to initial conditions of trajectories that leave the reactant region .",
    "the importance of the gap time distribution was emphasized by thiele @xcite , who explicitly invoked the concept of a phase space dividing surface separating reactants and products @xcite .",
    "while the use of dividing surfaces ( transition states ) defined in configuration space is quite familiar in the field of reaction rate theory @xcite , carrying out these steps in phase space , as opposed to configuration space , remains less familiar in practice @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show how the expression for the microcanonical rate of reaction described above can be evaluated using the phase space approach to reaction dynamics developed in a recent series of papers @xcite .",
    "moreover , we analyze in detail the properties of the gap time distribution previously obtained for hcn isomerization using the phase space reaction rate theory @xcite .",
    "the stucture of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : unimolecular ] we outline an approach to the classical theory of unimolecular reaction rates based upon the general formulation of thiele @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that various dynamical quantities related to the unimolecular reaction rate defined within thiele s approach can be rigorously defined and computed within the recently developed theoretical framework for phase space transition state theory @xcite .",
    "special emphasis is placed on the properties of the gap time distribution , and the relation between the inverse gap time and the rate of reaction . in section [ sec : hcn_data ] we consider the dynamics of the hcn isomerization reaction .",
    "we analyze previously computed classical trajectory results @xcite in light of the discussion given in section [ sec : unimolecular ] . both gap time and reactant",
    "lifetime distributions are analyzed , and distinct temporal regimes identified , with power law ( algebraic ) decay seen at intermediate times and exponential decay at long times .",
    "moreover , we find a statistical ( 1:1 ) product ratio for both algebraic and exponetial decay regimes .",
    "comparisons are made between computed values of the decay rate and statistical estimates of the isomerization rate .",
    "our results show that analysis of gap time distributions computed using phase space dividing surfaces having minimal flux and no - recrossing properties yields a great deal of information about the system dynamics .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] concludes .",
    "in this section we present a general formulation of unimolecular reaction rates based upon that originally given by thiele @xcite . in their general form",
    "the rate expressions derived by thiele explicitly invoke the existence of a _ phase space _ dividing surface separating reactants and products ; such surfaces , although discussed by wigner @xcite at the inception of the theory of chemical reaction rates ( see also @xcite ) , have only recently become amenable to direct computation via the use of normal form approaches @xcite      we are concerned with the rate of unimolecular reactions , either dissociation or isomerization , at fixed energy , for a system described by a time - independent , @xmath5 degree - of - freedom ( dof ) classical hamiltonian .",
    "points in the @xmath6-dimensional system phase space @xmath7 are denoted @xmath8 .",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath9 , and the @xmath10 dimensional energy shell at energy @xmath11 , @xmath12 , is denoted @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding microcanonical phase space density is @xmath14 , and the associated density of states for the complete energy shell at energy @xmath11 is @xmath15    the first step in the analysis is to define the region of the energy surface corresponding to the reactant of interest . for complex systems there may be many such regions of interest @xcite , but for the moment we focus on only one such region , and the rate at which trajectories leave that particular region .",
    "we treat either unimolecular dissociations or isomerizations in which molecules are removed from consideration immediately after passing from the reactant region of phase space , and are not therefore directly concerned here with reactive flux correlation functions or associated relaxation kinetics @xcite .    a standard approach to defining",
    "the reactant region is to consider the potential energy function  a configuration space based approach @xcite . in the simplest case the reactant region",
    "is associated with a single local minimum , and trajectories exit / enter the reactant region by passing over energetically accessible saddle points of the potential .",
    "although there could be several saddles controlling rates of exit from the potential well , as mentioned we will only consider the case of a single saddle .",
    "we comment on the case of multiple saddles below .",
    "however , dynamics occurs in phase space ( i.e. , on the energy surface @xmath13 for the situation we are considering ) while the picture described above is concerned with the projection of trajectories from phase space to configuration space . for multidimensional systems such as polyatomic molecules ( @xmath3 dof ) ,",
    "it is in general no longer possible to define or compute a dividing surface with desirable dynamical attributes such as the no - recrossing property by working in configuration space alone , and a phase space perspective is necessary @xcite .    while the phase space approach to reaction dynamics reviewed briefly below does not give a complete solution to the problem ( questions of transition state bifurcations and nonintegrability remain to be addressed , for example ) , it does provide an important component , which , when coupled with knowledge of certain properties of the system hamiltonian function , does provide the necessary information to identify the reactant region in some situations of interest .",
    "saddle points of the potential energy surface still play a role  in particular , rank one saddles . for hamiltonian functions that are the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy a rank one saddle point of the potential energy function",
    "is manifested as an equilibrium point of saddle type for the @xmath6 dimensional hamilton s equations @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it is an equilibrium point of saddle - center-@xmath16-center stability type , meaning that the @xmath17 matrix associated with the linearization of hamilton s equations about this equilibrium point has @xmath6 eigenvalues of the form @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the significance of saddle points of this type for hamilton s equations is that , for a range of energies above that of the saddle ( we explicitly discuss the range of energies later on ) , the energy surfaces have the _ bottleneck property _ in a phase space neighborhood near the saddle , i.e. the @xmath22 dimensional energy surface _ locally _ has the geometrical structure of the product of a @xmath23 dimensional sphere and an interval , @xmath24 .",
    "the bottleneck property is significant because in the vicinity of the bottleneck we are able to construct a dividing surface , @xmath25 , ( where ` @xmath11 ' denotes the energy dependence ) with very desirable properties . for each energy in this range above the saddle @xmath25 locally `` disconnects '' the energy surface into two , disjoint pieces with the consequence that the only way to pass from one piece of the energy surface to the other is to cross @xmath25 .",
    "the dividing surface has the geometrical structure of a @xmath23 dimensional sphere , @xmath26 , which is divided into two @xmath23 dimensional hemispheres , denoted @xmath27 and @xmath28 that are joined at an equator , which is a @xmath29 dimensional sphere , @xmath30 .",
    "the hemisphere @xmath27 corresponds to initial conditions of trajectories that enter the reaction region while @xmath28 corresponds to initial conditions of trajectories that exit the reaction region , both by passing through the bottleneck in the energy surface .",
    "the equator @xmath30 is an invariant manifold of saddle stability type , a so - called _ normally hyperbolic invariant manifold _ ( nhim ) @xcite .",
    "the nhim acts as the `` anchor '' for this entire construction and is of great physical significance : it is the actual `` saddle '' in phase space identified as the `` activated complex '' of reaction rate dynamics @xcite ) .",
    "our focus here is on microcanonical rates , and it has been shown that @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the essential _ no - recrossing property _ and that the flux across them is minimal @xcite .",
    "we denote the directional flux across these hemispheres by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and note that @xmath33 . for our purposes",
    "we only need the magnitude of the flux , and so set @xmath34 . most significantly , the hemisphere @xmath27 is the correct surface across which to compute the `` exact '' flux into the reaction region .",
    "the disjoint regions of phase space corresponding to species a ( reactant ) and b ( product ) will be denoted @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we assume that all coordinates and momenta are bounded on the reactant energy shell @xmath37 , and that it is possible to define a boundary ( dividing surface ) ds in phase space separating species a and b. as discussed above , the ds can be rigorously defined to be locally a surface of no return ( transition state ) . the microcanonical density of states for reactant species a is @xmath38 with a corresponding expression for the density of states @xmath39 for product b for the case of compact product energy shell @xmath36 .",
    "provided that the flow is everywhere transverse to @xmath40 , those phase points in the reactant region @xmath35 that lie on crossing trajectories @xcite ( i.e. , that will react , and so are `` interesting '' in slater s terminology @xcite ) can be specified uniquely by coordinates @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a point on @xmath27 , the incoming half of the ds , specified by @xmath43 coordinates @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a time variable .",

    "the physical interpretation of expression is that the thermal reaction rate @xmath92 is given by the average of the equilibrium activation rate times the probability that an activated phase point will react ( that is , cross the dividing surface ds@xmath100 ) before it suffers a ( strong ) deactivating collision .",
    "we note that the rate expression makes sense even though for larger energies @xmath11 the dividing surface ds@xmath101 with desired dynamical properties might no longer exist , as the contribution from high energies is damped away by the exponential boltzmann factor .",

    "this shows that over @xmath182% of phase points are trapped in the reactant region , and that the density of states @xmath183 associated with crossing trajectories is approximately 10% of the full reactant density of states @xmath184 .",
    "the value of @xmath185 has also been computed using the relation @xmath186 and shown to be identical with the result obtained via the survival probability @xcite .",
    "numerical values of relevant quantities are @xmath187 ps , @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is planck s constant , @xmath190 and @xmath191 . computed values for the total statistical decay rate coefficient ( in the symmetric case , equal to the single channel rate constant @xmath192 ) are @xmath193 ( rrkm , uncorrrected ) and @xmath194 ( rrkm , corrected ) .",
    "these values are to be compared with the long time decay rate @xmath195 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that , as noted previously ( ref .  , although cf .  ref .  ) , the value of the statistical rate constant `` corrected '' for the volume of trapped reactant phase points is both much larger than the uncorrected statistical rate and in significantly greater disagreement with the exact ( numerical ) value of @xmath174 . in fact , the ratio @xmath196 , so that the uncorrected statistical rate coefficient is within a factor of @xmath197 of the numerical escape rate .",
    "this is presumably due to compensating errors in the statistical calculation @xcite .",
    "the presence of trapped regions of reactive phase space decreases the volume of phase space that is available for reactive trajectories to explore ; this effect tends to increase the value of the actual escape rate with respect to the statistical estimate .",
    "as can be seen from the numerical values given above , if this were the only factor affecting the rate then the actual rate would be a factor of 10 larger than the rrkm estimate .",
    "however , additional dynamical trapping mechanisms , that are as yet not fully understood for multimode systems @xcite , serve to delay the exit of phase points from the reactant region .",
    "the competition between these two effects then results in a value of the numerical escape rate that is fairly close to the simple rrkm estimate @xcite .      in figure [ nlog12 ]",
    "we plot @xmath198 $ ] versus @xmath88 for each subsensemble , where @xmath199 is the number of phase points remaining in the well at time @xmath88 . except at extremely short times",
    "@xmath200 ps , the two curves are essentially identical .",
    "for those times during which the decay curves are identical , the associated product branching ratio is equal to its statistical value , unity .",
    "the fact that the curves can be overlaid even at times for which the decay of each ensemble is nonexponential ( algebraic ) then implies that we have a statistical product ratio in the absence of exponential decay .",
    "( note that exponential decay is usually taken to be the signature of `` statistical '' dynamics @xcite . )",
    "the identity of the decay curves also implies the equality of the algebraic decay exponents noted previously .",
    "a qualitative explanation of this behavior is as follows : note that we start with a highly asymmetric initial ensemble , entering via @xmath201 only .",
    "this bundle of trajectories passes through the hcn well , over to @xmath202 .",
    "some fraction of the ensemble exits through @xmath203 and is lost .",
    "the rest of the trajectories then turn back , and pass through the well again , over to @xmath204 .",
    "some fraction is again lost .",
    "( these are the `` pulses '' seen in the short - time gap time distribution . ) and so on .",
    "the point is that , after the trajectory bundle has oscillated back and forth in the hcn well several times , the set of phase points still in the well behaves _ as if _ as if it were an ensemble consisting of trajectories initiated in equal numbers on both entry dividing surfaces and then propagated for @xmath205 ps .",
    "the underlying idea here is that , when trajectories are `` turned back '' from a ds , their subsequent time evolution can be qualitatively similar to that of trajectories actually initiated on the same ds .",
    "for example , trajectories turned back at @xmath202 that are just `` outside '' the incoming reactive cylinder manifold associated with the dividing surface @xcite will track ( shadow @xcite ) trajectories that actually enter the reactant region through @xmath206 inside the reactive cylinder and lie close to the boundary ( unstable manifold @xmath207 ) .    the hcn gap time",
    "/ lifetime distributions therefore imply that the initial ensemble effectively attains the full symmetry of the reactant phase space some time before it fully relaxes to the stage where exponential decay is observed @xcite , so that the system exhibits statistical branching ratios in the absence of exponential decay .",
    "the trajectory calculations analyzed here were carried out using the mch potential surface @xcite at a constant energy @xmath208 ev ( @xmath209 ev above the saddle energy ) .",
    "tang , jang , zhao and rice ( tjzr ) @xcite have carried out classical trajectory calculations using the same potential surface for a number of energies , and have applied an approximate version @xcite of the 3-state statistical theory of gray and rice @xcite as well as a reaction path approach @xcite to compute isomerization rate constants for the 3 dof , zero angular momentum hcn isomerization .",

    "extract an isomerization rate of @xmath211 a.u .  from their trajectory calculations , corresponding to a mean lifetime of @xmath212 ps @xcite .",
    "this rate , which determines the timescale for decay of the cnh population and is therefore strictly the relaxation rate @xmath213 @xcite , is actually obtained by computing the average escape time ( lifetime ) for an ensemble of trajectories in the cnh well , while somewhat arbitrarily omitting from consideration short - lived trajectories with lifetimes @xmath214 a.u .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the value of the mean lifetime computed by tjzr at @xmath215 is close to the mean gap time ( @xmath216 ps ) computed at @xmath208 ev @xcite .",
    "both approximate rate theories applied to the problem by tjzr give isomerization rates within factors of 2 - 3 of the trajectory values .",
    "these approximate statistical theories are however only capable of describing short time kinetics @xcite ; the slow decays apparent from the trajectory data of tjzr ( see figure 7 of @xcite ; cf .",
    "figs [ lifetime_all ] , [ lifetime_1 ] and [ lifetime_2 ] of the present paper ) are not predicted by 2- or 3-state statistical models .",
    "the algebraic decay observed at intermediate times in the present work suggests that incorporation of a small number of approximate intramolecular bottlenecks into the statistical model @xcite is unlikely to lead to an accurate description of decay dynamics at longer times .",
    "finally , it is very interesting to note that the dynamical behavior associated with the gap time distribution analyzed here for hcn isomerization provides an exemplary instance of the highly nonstatistical dynamics discussed by carpenter in the context of reactions of organic molecules @xcite .",
    "thus , as discussed above , an ensemble of trajectories is launched into a reactant region ( the hcn well ) for which there are two equivalent exits ( `` products '' ) .",
    "any statistical theory predicts a 1:1 branching ratio , as there is by symmetry equal probability of leaving via exit 1 or 2 .",
    "the trajectory calculations however show that a significant fraction of the initial ensemble of trajectories simply passes through the hcn well and exits directly via channel 2 in a very short time ; the remainder of the ensemble then sloshes back and forth in the well leading to the pulses seen at short times in the gap time distribution ; these pulses are associated with bursts of exiting trajectories alternating between channels 2 and 1 . at longer times , @xmath205 ps , we enter a regime in which decay into either channel is equally likely . by this time , however , most of the trajectories have already exited the well .",
    "in this paper we have revisited the general approach to classical unimolecular reaction rates due to thiele @xcite in light of recent advances in the phase space formulation of transition state theory for multidimensional systems @xcite .",
    "we showed that key concepts in thieles s approach , namely the phase space dividing surface separating reactants from products , the average gap time , and the volume of phase space associated with reactive ( interesting @xcite ; crossing @xcite ) trajectories , are both rigorously defined and readily computed within the phase space approach @xcite .",

    "both algebraic ( power law ) and exponential decay regimes have been identified .",
    "the dynamical origins of power law behavior or ` fractional dynamics ' in multimode hamiltonian systems , especially at intermediate times , remain obscure @xcite .",
    "when combined with the normal form algorithm for computation and sampling of the phase space dividing surface , the cumulative gap time distribution is nevertheless a powerful diagnostic for reactive dynamics in multi - dimensional systems .",
    "we have also compared statistical estimates of the isomerization rate @xcite with the numerically determined decay rate .",
    "we have found that , as noted by others @xcite , correcting the rrkm estimate to account for the measure of the reactant phase space region occupied by trapped trajectories results in a drastic overestimate of the isomerization rate . compensating but as yet poorly understood trapping mechanisms in the reactant region serve to slow the escape rate sufficiently that the uncorrected rrkm estimate turns out to be reasonably accurate , at least at the particular energy studied .    in the planar model of hcn isomerization",
    "studied here , trajectories can exit the hcn well through either of 2 channels , where the channels are related by a reflection symmetry .",
    "analysis of the decay properties of the subsensembles of trajectories that exit through particular channels shows that , despite a highly asymmetric distribution of initial conditions , the complete trajectory ensemble effectively attains the full symmetry of the system phase space on a short timescale @xmath1 ps , after which the product branching ratio is 1:1 , the `` statistical '' value .",

    "<S> the general approach to classical unimolecular reaction rates due to thiele is revisited in light of recent advances in the phase space formulation of transition state theory for multidimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> key concepts such as the phase space dividing surface separating reactants from products , the average gap time , and the volume of phase space associated with reactive trajectories , are both rigorously defined and readily computed within the phase space approach . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail the gap time distribution and associated reactant lifetime distribution for the isomerization reaction hcn @xmath0 cnh , previously studied using the methods of phase space transition state theory . </S>",
    "<S> both algebraic ( power law ) and exponential decay regimes have been identified . </S>",
    "<S> statistical estimates of the isomerization rate are compared with the numerically determined decay rate . correcting the rrkm estimate to account for the measure of the reactant phase space region occupied by trapped trajectories results in a drastic overestimate of the isomerization rate . compensating but as yet poorly understood trapping mechanisms in the reactant region serve to slow the escape rate sufficiently that the uncorrected rrkm estimate turns out to be reasonably accurate , at least at the particular energy studied . </S>",
    "<S> examination of the decay properties of subsensembles of trajectories that exit the hcn well through either of 2 available symmetry related product channels shows that the complete trajectory ensemble effectively attains the full symmetry of the system phase space on a short timescale @xmath1 ps , after which the product branching ratio is 1:1 , the `` statistical '' value . at intermediate times , this statistical product ratio is accompanied by nonexponential ( nonstatistical ) decay . </S>",
    "<S> we point out close parallels between the dynamical behavior inferred from the gap time distribution for hcn and nonstatistical behavior recently identified in reactions of some organic molecules . </S>"
