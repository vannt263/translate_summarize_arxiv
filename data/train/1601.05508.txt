    "<S> the nasa wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) _ has discovered almost all the known members of the new class of y - type brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> most of these y dwarfs have been identified as isolated objects in the field . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that binaries with l- and t - type brown dwarf primaries are less prevalent than either m - dwarf or solar - type primaries , they tend to have smaller separations and are more frequently detected in near - equal mass configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the binary statistics for y - type brown dwarfs , however , are sparse , and so it is unclear if the same trends that hold for l- and t - type brown dwarfs also hold for y - type ones . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the detection of binary companions to very cool y dwarfs may well be the best means available for discovering even colder objects . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for binary properties of a sample of five _ wise _ y dwarfs with the gemini multi - conjugate adaptive optics system ( gems ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for binary companions in these data , which suggests these systems are not equal - luminosity ( or equal - mass ) binaries with separations larger than @xmath0 0.5 - 1.9 au . for equal - mass binaries at an age of 5 gyr </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the binary binding energies ruled out by our observations ( i.e. @xmath1erg ) are consistent with those observed in previous studies of hotter ultra - cool dwarfs . </S>"
