    "despite the enormous progress of neutrino physics in the last decade , many open questions remain to be solved . among them",
    "are two , the mass hierarchy ",
    "normal versus inverted mass spectrum  and the value of the 13-mixing angle @xmath2 , where the observation of neutrinos from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) could provide important clues  @xcite .",
    "schematically , the neutrino emission by a sn can be divided into four stages : infall phase , neutronization burst , accretion , and kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase . during the infall phase and neutronization",
    "burst only @xmath1 s are emitted , while the bulk of neutrino emission is released in all flavors in the two latest phases . whereas the neutrino emission characteristics of the two initial stages are basically independent of the features of the progenitor , such as its mass or equation of state ( eos ) of the core , the details of the neutrino fluxes during the accretion and cooling phases may significantly change for different sn models .",
    "therefore , a straightforward extraction of oscillation parameters from the bulk of the sn neutrino signal seems hopeless . only features in the detected neutrino spectra that are independent of unknown sn parameters",
    "should be used in such an analysis .    in this",
    "talk we discuss the potential of the two most promising sources for such features : the modulations in the @xmath3 spectra caused by the earth matter  @xcite or by the passage of shock waves through the sn envelope  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we show how the detection of the neutronization @xmath1 burst could help to break possible degeneracies in the case that @xmath2 is still unknown . in tab .",
    "[ abc - table ] it is shown the dependence of these three observables on three different neutrino mass schemes .",
    ".the presence of earth - matter and shock wave effects in the @xmath3 spectra and of the @xmath1 burst for different neutrino mixing scenarios . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ models - table ]    the effects of the shock wave propagation are clearly visible , and are independent of the assumptions about the initial neutrino spectra  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not only possible to detect the shock wave propagation in general , but also to identify the specific imprints of the forward and reverse shock versus the forward shock only case .",
    "the signature of the reverse shock is its double - dip structure compared to the one - dip of a forward shock only .",
    "the observation of the details of the shock wave structure will be , though , tightly related to the absence of strong density fluctuations after the shock front  @xcite .",
    "events binned in time for a static density profile , a profile with only a forward shock , and with forward and reverse shock .",
    "g1 model was assumed for the neutrino fluxes .",

    "[ fig : eav_g2 ] , width=245,height=207 ]",
    "as it has been previously mentioned , before the shock wave reaches the h - resonance layer the dependence of the conversion probability in the cases a , b and c on the neutrino energy @xmath5 is very weak .",
    "however , if neutrinos cross the earth before reaching the detector , the conversion probabilities may become energy - dependent and induce modulations in the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "these modulations may be observed in the form of local peaks and valleys in the spectrum of the event rate @xmath6 plotted as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "these modulations arise in the antineutrino channel only in cases a and c. therefore its observation would exclude case b. this distortion in the spectra could be measured by comparing the neutrino signal at two or more different detectors such that the neutrinos travel different distances through the earth before reaching them  @xcite",
    ". however these earth matter effects can be also identified in a single detector  @xcite .",
    "the net @xmath3 flux at the detector may be written in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the `` inverse energy '' parameter @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 depend only on the mixing parameters .    ,",

    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ fedbar - y ] ) are also slowly varying functions of @xmath9 , and hence contain frequencies in @xmath9 that are much smaller than the @xmath13 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath13 are completely independent of the primary neutrino spectra , and can be determined to a good accuracy from the knowledge of the solar oscillation parameters , the earth matter density , and the position of the sn in the sky  @xcite .",
    "the latter can be determined with sufficient precision even if the sn is optically obscured using the pointing capability of water cherenkov neutrino detectors  @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath15 detected neutrino events is @xmath16 in the absence of earth effect modulations , @xmath17 has an average value of one for @xmath18 .",
    "the region @xmath19 is dominated by the `` 0-peak '' , which is a manifestation of the low frequency terms in eq .",
    "( [ fedbar - y ] ) .",
    "identifying earth effects is equivalent to observing excess power in @xmath17 around the known frequencies @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lena_gl ] we show the averaged power spectra in the case of a 32 kton scintillator detector for neutrinos travelling only through the earth mantle ( left panels ) and traversing both mantle and core ( right panels ) .",
    "it is possible to observe how in the former case only one peak is present , whereas in the case that neutrinos go through the core more frequencies arise .",
    "the model independence of the peak positions may be confirmed by comparing the top and bottom panels . since in the real world the presence of fluctuations in the signal , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gk ] , will spoil any naive theoretical peak , we need to introduce a prescription to carry out the analysis .",
    "one possibility is to consider the area around the expected position of the peak .",
    "the area under the power spectrum between two fixed frequencies @xmath20 and @xmath21 is on an average @xmath22 . in the absence of earth effects , this area will have a distribution centered around this mean .",
    "the earth effect peaks tend to increase this area .",
    "the confidence level of peak identification , @xmath23 , may then be defined as the fraction of the area of the background distribution that is less than the actual area measured .    ,",

    "[ fig : p95 ] , we compare @xmath24 obtained with a 32 kton scintillator detector and a megaton water cherenkov detector assuming a sn at 10 kpc and the @xmath25 model for neutrino fluxes . in the latter case , as neutrinos travel more and more distance in the mantle the peak moves to higher @xmath26 values , and due to the high @xmath26 suppression , the efficiency of peak identification decreases .",
    "when the neutrinos start traversing the core , additional low @xmath26 peaks are generated and the efficiency increases again .",
    "the identification of earth matter effects excludes case b , and is thus complementary to the observation of shock wave effects .     as a function of nadir angle @xmath27 for a 32 kton scintillator ( sc ) and a megaton water cherenkov ( hk ) detector  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : p95],width=245,height=207 ]",
    "if the value of @xmath2 is unknown , a degeneracy exists between case a and c. both scenarios predict the same @xmath3 signature in a water cherenkov detector , and therefore the previous two observables are not useful to disentangle them . in this case",
    ", the additional information encoded in the @xmath1 neutrinos emitted during the neutronization burst can fix the range of @xmath2 as well as the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the prompt neutronization burst takes place during the first @xmath29 25  ms after the core bounce with a typical full width half maximum of 57@xmath30ms and a peak luminosity of 3.33.5@xmath31erg@xmath30s@xmath32 .",
    "the striking similarity of the neutrino emission characteristics despite the variability in the properties of the pre - collapse cores is caused by a regulation mechanism between electron number fraction and target abundances for electron capture which establishes similar electron fractions in the inner core during collapse .",
    "this leads to a convergence of the structure of the central part of the collapsing cores and only small differences in the evolution of different progenitors until shock breakout .",
    "the small dependence of the neutronization burst on , e.g. , the progenitor mass can be verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuepeak ] ( cf . also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . taking into account that the sn will be likely obscured by dust and a good estimation of the distance will not be possible , the time structure of the detected neutrino signal should be used as signature for the neutronization burst  @xcite .",
    "since the event number in current and proposed charged - current @xmath1 detectors is not high enough to allow for a detailed time analysis , we discuss only the case of a megaton water cherenkov detector . here",
    "one has to consider the @xmath1 elastic scattering on electrons , which is affected by several backgrounds like inverse beta decay or reactions on oxygen .",
    "this background can be substantially reduced by using angular and energy cuts , as well as gadolinium to tag neutrons from inverse beta decays .",
    "the sample of elastic scattering events still contains the irreducible background of scattering on electrons of other neutrino flavors than @xmath1 , but this contamination does not affect the possibility to disentangle the different neutrino scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the signal depends strongly on the neutrino mixing scheme . in case",
    "a , the @xmath1 survival probability is close to zero , and therefore the peak structure observed in the initial @xmath1 luminosity is absent . on the contrary , in case c , 30% of the original @xmath1 remain as @xmath1 whereas 70% are converted into @xmath33 . since the cross section of @xmath1 on electrons is much larger than that of @xmath33 , the signal is dominated by the contribution of @xmath1 .",
    "these @xmath1 s follow the time evolution of @xmath34 , and thus lead to a clear peak in the signal .",
    ", width=245,height=207 ]     events per time bin in a megaton water cherenkov detector for a sn at 10 kpc for cases a ( dashed lines ) and c ( solid lines ) and for different progenitor masses .",
    "statistical errors are also shown for the @xmath35 case  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : nuepeak2],width=245,height=207 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuepeak2 ] we show the expected neutrino signal from @xmath36 to 18  ms for different progenitor masses , and for the mixing scenarios a and c. the peak structure can be clearly seen in case c , but not in case a  @xcite . including recent improvements of the electron capture rates or uncertainties in the nuclear equation of state",
    "has only little effect on the neutronization peak compared to the size of the statistical fluctuations .",
    "therefore the observation of a peak in the first milliseconds of the neutrino signal would rule out case a.",
    "a reliable determination of neutrino parameters using sn neutrinos should be independent from the primary neutrino fluxes produced during the accretion and cooling phase of the sn . earth - matter effects and the passage of sn shocks through the h - resonance both introduce unique modulations in the neutrino energy spectrum that allow one their identification without knowledge of the primary neutrino spectra . while the observation of earth - matter effects in the @xmath3 energy spectrum rules out case b , modulations in the @xmath3 time spectrum identify case b. if the value of @xmath2 would be known to be large , then the neutrino mass hierarchy would be identified .",
    "otherwise , the detection of the neutronization @xmath1 peak  a robust feature of all modern sn simulations  can break the remaining degeneracy between a and c.    i am greatly grateful to the local organizers for the warm hospitality during the conference .",
