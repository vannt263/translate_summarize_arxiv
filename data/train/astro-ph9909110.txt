    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is an empirical relation between galaxy half - light radius , @xmath6 , surface brightness , @xmath7 , and central velocity dispersion , @xmath8 for early - type galaxies .",
    "locally , @xmath9 in gunn @xmath10 ( jrgensen  1996 ) . under the assumption of homology , this implies @xmath11 .",
    "the fundamental plane is very thin , with an  scatter of @xmath12 in coma in @xmath5 ratio for a given galaxy mass , @xmath13 ( jrgensen  1993 ) . with its low scatter ,",
    "the fp is a very powerful tool for measuring the evolution of galaxy @xmath0 ratios as a function of redshift , @xmath13 , etc .    because reasonable stellar populations evolve as @xmath14 ( tinsley & gunn 1976 ) , evolution in the properties of the fundamental plane directly probe the star - formation histories of cluster galaxies .",
    "measurements of the evolution of the fp zero - point , scatter , and slope can be used to constrain the mean epoch of star - formation , the spread in early - type galaxy ages ; and the dependence of galaxy age on , e.g. , @xmath13 .",
    "we exploit high resolution keck spectroscopy for velocity dispersions and line strengths , and wfpc2 imaging for the structural parameters , colors , and morphologies .",
    "details can be found in kelson ( 1999abc ) .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure 1 shows the tight fundamental plane relation in the @xmath1 cluster cl1358 + 62 .",
    "the 30 e / s0s in this sample are fit by the following plane in johnson @xmath15 ( kelson 1999c ) : @xmath16 this sample has comparable depth to the fp samples of coma , ensuring that the comparison of these fp exponents with those determined in nearby clusters is reasonably free from selection effects .",
    "we draw the following three conclusions :    @xmath17 mild evolution in the fp zero - point , of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , indicates a mean redshift of formation of @xmath20 for the stars in cluster e / s0s .",
    "@xmath17 the scatter in the color - magnitude relation and fp suggest a 1-@xmath8 scatter in ages of 15% . for @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23-@xmath8 is equivalent to @xmath24 .    @xmath17 no evolution in the fp slope",
    "is seen , indicating that the mean luminosity weighted ages of the stellar populations do not depend significantly on @xmath8 or @xmath13 : @xmath25",
    "our sample contains many galaxies of type s0/a through sb .",
    "these early - type spirals are shown with the e / s0s in the right - hand panel of figure 1 .",
    "the spirals show large scatter about the fp and have systematically higher surface brightnesses for a given @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the scatter for the early - type spirals is twice as large as that for the e / s0s . for the spirals ,",
    "the fp residuals correlate strongly with residual from the color - magnitude relation ( see kelson  1999c ) .    correcting the surface brightnesses of the spirals for their young stellar populations using their residuals from the color - magnitude relation ,",
    "one obtains a new plane for the spirals which follows that of the e / s0s .",
    "we conclude that after several gyr , these spirals , including the low - mass e+as , may evolve into present - day , low - mass s0s and appear in nearby fp samples .",
    "the cl1358 + 62 spectra are of sufficiently high @xmath26 that one can accurately measure absorption line strengths , and use stellar population synthesis models , such as those of vazdekis  ( 1996 ) , to constrain the systematic variation of the stellar populations along the fp and color - magnitude relations .    in figure 2",
    ", we show that the sequence of e / s0 galaxies in cl1358 + 62 is defined by a tight correlation between c@xmath274668   and restframe @xmath28 color .",
    "the best - fit slope of the correlation is nearly identical to that predicted for a sequence of single - burst stellar population models of constant age , in which only metallicity varies . even with these preliminary measurements ,",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the correlations of the metal - sensitive c@xmath274668index with the high - order balmer lines . in the first panel of figure 3 ,",
    "the c@xmath274668  index is shown to systematically correlate with the h@xmath29 index in a manner which is also consistent with the line of constant age .",
    "the scatter in these two diagrams is consistent with the small scatter in ages that has been estimated using the fp and color - magnitude relations ( kelson  1999c , van dokkum 1998 ) .",
    "the latter two panels show the correlations of c@xmath274668  and h@xmath29 with central velocity dispersion , indicating that metallicity is strongly correlated with the depth of the galaxy potential .",
    "the solid lines are the best - fit slopes , with the @xmath30-@xmath8 uncertainties indicated by dotted lines . using the vazdekis  ( 1996 ) models , these correlations with velocity dispersion imply @xmath31 .",
    "preliminary analysis using monte carlo simulations of real data ( kelson 1999 ) indicate that this correlation can produce an observed fp of the approximate form : @xmath32 , though the precise shape depends on sample selection criteria , and the underlying distribution of bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "we have found that the slope of the fundamental plane has remained constant with redshift .",
    "together with the absorption line strengths and restframe colors , these data suggest that early - type galaxies in clusters have very uniform stellar population ages , and chemical abundances which are strongly determined by the depths of their potential wells , assuming that the stellar populations of cluster e / s0s can be adequately modeled by simple single - burst models .",
    "the implied correlation of metallicity with @xmath8 appears to be the physical basis behind both the color - magnitude relation and the fundamental plane , though further work is required to fully understand the nature of the selection biases and other systematic effects .",
