    "the dynamics of stars in a galaxy is uniquely defined by the distribution function and the potential in which the stars move . from the many stable equilibrium configurations for collisionless systems which can in principle be constructed , only some of them",
    "are actually observed in our universe .",
    "this constitutes a ` fossil record ' of galaxy formation .",
    "it is still not clear what observable constraints are needed to recover both the distribution function and the gravitational potential of a stellar system ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for spherical geometry ) , but simple dimensionality arguments imply that this should not be possible without the knowledge of the full line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvd ) at all spatial positions on the galaxy image on the sky .",
    "it is therefore useful to explore how the losvd can be recovered from the observations .    considering galaxies as pure stellar systems ,",
    "the spectrum observed at a certain sky position is a ( luminosity - weighted ) sum of individual stellar spectra redshifted according to their line - of - sight velocities .",
    "if one makes the assumption that the spectrum of all stars is given by a single template , then it simply reduces to the convolution between that spectrum and the losvd , which can then be retrieved by solving the inverse problem , i.e. , deconvolving the spectra using the template .",
    "deconvolution is an intrinsically ill - conditioned problem , which amplifies noise and measurement errors . due to the special care required in the inversion",
    "many techniques have been developed in the last 30 years to recover the losvd from the data .",
    "the evolution in the methods has been mainly driven by the gradual improvement in the observational techniques and the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) of the data , and by the steady increase in the available computational speed .",
    "early methods were mostly using fourier based techniques , which allowed the losvd to be recovered quickly , from a deconvolution process , and in some cases included techniques to reduce the effect of template mismatch @xcite .",
    "more recently methods have shifted towards fitting the losvd directly in pixel space @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this are that ( i ) in pixel space it becomes easy to exclude gas emission lines or bad pixels from the fit , and take continuum matching directly into account ; ( ii ) current computers can accommodate the larger computational cost involved ; ( iii ) the availability of libraries with high spectral resolution stellar and galaxy spectra allows the template to be carefully matched to the observed galaxy spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed historical overview of the various methods .",
    "the different techniques can be further subdivided according to whether the losvd is derived in a non - parametric way ( in practice computed on a small set of discrete values ) or parametrically , as a function of a limited number of parameters . in the latter case",
    "the gauss - hermite parametrization by @xcite and @xcite is essentially always adopted ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for an alternative ) .",
    "however even when the losvd is determined non - parametrically , the gauss - hermite parameters are still generally used to present the result in an easily understandable way .    in this paper",
    "we study again the problem of recovering , while working in pixel space , a losvd described by the gauss - hermite parametrization .",
    "compared to the non - parametric case , the process and the estimation of measurement errors are simplified . in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] we describe the general problem . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we discuss different approaches to the extraction , we find that special care has to be taken when the losvd is undersampled by the data or the @xmath0  is low , and we present a solution based on the maximum penalized likelihood formalism . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we draw some conclusions .",
    "the parametric recovery of the losvd in pixel space starts with creating a model galaxy spectrum @xmath1 , by convolving a template spectrum @xmath2 by a parametrized losvd .",
    "both the object and the template spectra are rebinned in wavelength to a linear scale in @xmath3 , while usually preserving the number of spectral pixels .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of the losvd are determined by minimizing the @xmath4 , which measures the agreement between the model and the observed galaxy spectrum @xmath5 , over the set of @xmath6 good pixels : @xmath7 where the residuals are defined as @xmath8 with @xmath9 the measurement error on @xmath10 .",
    "more specifically the following model is adopted for the galaxy spectrum : @xmath11(x ) + \\sum_{l=0}^{l } b_l \\mathcal{p}_l(x ) \\qquad w_k\\ge0 ,      \\label{model}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is in general a library of @xmath13 galaxy or stellar templates , @xmath14 is the broadening function , with @xmath15 the losvd , @xmath16 is the speed of light and @xmath17 denotes convolution .",
    "the @xmath18 are here chosen to be the legendre polynomials of order @xmath19 and account for low frequency differences in shape between the galaxy and the templates .",
    "for each given @xmath15 , the optimization of @xmath4 is a bounded - variables linear least - squares problem for the weights @xmath20 which can be solved , e.g. , with the specific bvls algorithm by @xcite , or as a quadratic programming problem .",
    "here we are interested in the determination of the parameters defining @xmath15 and in what follows we will assume that the weights of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) are always optimized in this way .",
    "multiplicative polynomials can also be included in the fit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , without affecting the discussion that follows .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite it has become standard to expand the losvd as a gauss - hermite series @xmath21      \\label{losvd}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and the @xmath23 are the hermite polynomials . with these definitions the minimization of the @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) is a nonlinear least - squares optimization problem for the @xmath24 parameters @xmath25 .",

    "we will use the minpack implementation @xcite of the levenberg - marquardt method for nonlinear least - squares problems .",
    "in this section we compare three different approaches to the determination of the best - fitting parameters of the losvd in eq .",
    "( [ losvd ] ) .",
    "we explain the limitations of the different methods and finally select the last one as the optimal choice .",
    "we do not address here the template mismatch issue , which we assume is minimized by the choice of an optimal library of templates in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) as in @xcite .    to explain the characteristics of the three methods , we will use each of them to extract a realistic but known losvd , observed by @xcite at @xmath27 along the major axis of the s0 galaxy ngc  3115 ( their fig .",
    "this losvd ( fig .",
    "[ sb_losvd ] ) is representative of the one observed in a number of galaxies , and can be very well described by a double gaussian parametrization @xmath28 ,      \\label{double_gauss}\\ ] ] with parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33  and @xmath34  ( the losvd was shifted to zero mean velocity ) .",
    "the best fit to @xmath35 using a fourth order gauss - hermite series ( eq .  [ losvd ] ) is obtained with parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while the best fitting gaussian has @xmath40  and @xmath41 .      in an ideal situation where the losvd is perfectly sampled by the data , the @xmath43 parameters of the losvd ( eq .  [ losvd ] ) are essentially uncorrelated to @xmath42 .",
    "therefore one expects the best - fitting parameters to change little , irrespective of whether @xmath42 are fitted first or together with the other parameters .",
    "to lowest order the difference between the two approaches is given by eq .",
    "( 10 ) of @xcite .",
    "an advantage of fitting @xmath42 first is that the gauss - hermite parameters that one obtains , coincide with the true gauss - hermite moments integrated over the losvd ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this also means that the value of the parameters @xmath43 do not depend on the adopted number @xmath24 of terms in the expansion .",
    "this precise relation between the losvd and the extracted kinematical parameters can be very useful for the dynamical modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover when only a single template is adopted ( @xmath44 in eq .",
    "[ model ] ) , for each pair of @xmath42 values the best fitting value of all the remaining parameters @xmath45 can be determined linearly .",
    "these ideas led @xcite to design an efficient method to fit the parameters of the losvd in pixel space , where @xmath42 are fitted first and the remaining parameters are linearly expanded at the best fitting @xmath42 solution .    for extracting the stellar kinematics of the 72 galaxies of the sauron  survey @xcite we needed to operate in pixel space to be able to deal with the contamination due to emission - line gas present in most of the observed objects @xcite .",
    "the speed of @xcite pixel fitting algorithm was an attractive feature , given the large number ( @xmath46 ) of independent spectra from the survey and the need to compute accurate errors by monte carlo simulations .",
    "however the observed losvds are not always well sampled by the sauron  pixel scale of @xmath47 .",
    "the nyquist critical frequency for @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "this means that undersampling becomes a problem for the derivation of the first four gauss - hermite moments of the losvd when the observed velocity dispersion is of the order of @xmath50 pixels ( for sauron  @xmath51 ) .    to test the accuracy of the recovery of the gauss - hermite moments using this method ,",
    "when undersampling becomes significant , we first created a realistic model spectrum by fitting a ( logarithmically rebinned ) library of @xcite galaxy model spectra to the average sauron  spectrum of the barred lenticular galaxy ngc  3384 .",
    "this spectrum was oversampled by smoothly interpolating it on a 30 times finer spectral grid and was subsequently convolved with the losvd of fig .",
    "[ sb_losvd ] .",
    "it was integrated over the sauron  pixels , in the wavelength range 4800 - 5380  , and poissonian noise was finally added to represent the simulated galaxy spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "the template @xmath2 was obtained by integrating the original oversampled spectrum over the sauron  pixels . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] we show an example of such a spectrum , with noise added at @xmath52 .",
    "we subsequently tried to recover the true gauss - hermite moments , by fitting @xmath42 first and expanding @xmath43 linearly at the best fitting @xmath42 location . to check our results we computed the true moments @xmath53 , by analytically integrating over the losvd ( eq",
    ".  8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using @xmath42 of the best fitting gaussian computed in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "we found @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which as expected are very close to the best fitting parameters computed before .",
    "the result of this test , both for a @xmath52 and @xmath56 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ v_sigma ] . here",
    "the shape of the input losvd was held fixed , but the velocity scale was varied so that the @xmath57 of the best fitting gauss - hermite series varied in the range 48360 , corresponding to 0.86 sauron  pixels , for 1000 different monte carlo realizations . by construction , for @xmath58  the losvd reduces to the one presented in fig .",
    "[ sb_losvd ] .",
    "the recovery of the true moments is _ strongly _ biased when @xmath59  ( 4 pixels ) .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that , when the losvd is not very well sampled , an asymmetry in the profile can be compensated , during the gaussian fit , by a small @xmath60 shift , while a symmetric deviation from a gaussian is nearly equivalent to a change of @xmath61 .",
    "the bias in the recovery of the input parameters remains unchanged even for a noise - free model spectrum , although of course the scatter in the values disappears . and no improvement is observed if the template is oversampled before convolving it with a well sampled losvd in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "these results are representative of what we found with different realistic input losvds .",
    "what was seen in the simulation is also found on real sauron  data .",
    "the approach of fitting @xmath42 first , becomes insensitive to any deviation from a gaussian losvd , when the observed velocity dispersion is low ( @xmath62 , or 2 pixels ) . as a practical example",
    "this method gives the misleading impression that the losvd in the nucleus of a low - dispersion object like ngc  3384 , containing a fast - rotating disk - like structure , is consistent with being essentially symmetric , as , e.g. , the central losvd of the high - dispersion non - rotating giant elliptical galaxy m  87 .",
    "this apparent similarity of the overall shape of losvd in the two different galaxies is an artefact of the extraction method , and we will show that it is still possible to recover , with a different method , the strong asymmetry of the losvd from the sauron  data of ngc  3384 , even at low dispersion .",
    "the bias present in the recovery of the gauss - hermite moments of an undersampled losvd , in the previous section , was mainly due to the fact that @xmath42 were not fitted simultaneously with the other losvd parameters .",
    "the fit should then become generally unbiased when all @xmath25 parameters are varied simultaneously to optimize the fit . in this way one should recover the best fitting parameters of the gauss - hermite series , which do not precisely coincide with the true gauss - hermite moments of the losvd . by definition this method will provide the lowest @xmath4 in the fit , and for this reason it was also originally chosen by @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fit_all ] we repeated the experiment of the previous section while fitting all the above nonlinear parameters together . as expected the solution is now almost unbiased and the measurements tend to be spread around the true input values , for a wider @xmath57 range . however ,",
    "when @xmath63  ( 2 pixels ) and the losvd is correspondingly not well sampled , the spectrum does not contain enough information to constrain all the free parameters and the scatter in the recovered values increases dramatically .",
    "moreover , at low @xmath57 , the @xmath61 and @xmath48 values are not unbiased any more , not being symmetrically distributed around the known input values .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry can be understood by looking at the shape of the @xmath4 contours , which measure the agreement between the input spectrum @xmath5 and its best fitting model @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ chi2plot ] we plot the @xmath64 contours for fits obtained by convolving @xmath5 with the losvd of fig .",
    "[ sb_losvd ] , while keeping @xmath60 and @xmath65 fixed to the known best fitting values ( sec .  [ discussion ] ) and varying @xmath61 and @xmath48 of @xmath1 .",
    "the narrow curved valley of nearly constant @xmath4 , for decreasing @xmath61 and increasing @xmath48 from the location of the minimum @xmath66 , is due to the strong correlation between these two parameters , which is caused by the undersampling , and produces the effects seen in fig .",
    "[ fit_all ] .",
    "when the errors in the measured parameters are large , one has to make a scatter versus bias tradeoff decision .",
    "usually when the data are unable to tightly constrain a large number of parameters one prefers to retain in the fit only the parameters that are required to significantly decrease the @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , while fitting a parametric losvd , it is common practice to reduce the fit to @xmath42 at low @xmath0 : although the fit may be biased by the lack of freedom in the model , an additional flexibility would not lead to meaningful measurements , and structures and trends in the @xmath42 values can still be detected due to the decreased scatter .",
    "another problem of the large scatter that is present when fitting all parameters together is specific to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kinematical measurements obtained with an integral - field spectrograph . when presenting kinematics maps there is no easy way to also attach errors to the displayed values , and it becomes difficult to estimate from the maps when some structure is real and when it is due to noise .",
    "for this reason it would be preferable to display on the kinematics maps only the features that are statistically significant .",
    "the losvd of galaxies is generally well reproduced by a gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason one would like to use a technique to fit the losvd in which the solution is free to reproduce the details of the actual profile when the @xmath0  is high , but where the solution tends to a gaussian shape in case the @xmath0  is low .",
    "this was done for the case the losvd is described by a non - parametric function , by using the maximum penalized likelihood formalism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we refer to that paper for details . here",
    "we apply the formalism to the case where the losvd is parametrically expanded as a gauss - hermite series .",
    "we will show that this leads to a much simpler and faster implementation than for the general case .",
    "the idea is to fit the parameters @xmath25 simultaneously as in sec .  [ together ] , but to add an adjustable penalty term to the @xmath4 , to bias the solution towards a gaussian shape , when the higher moments are unconstrained by the data , so that the penalized @xmath4 becomes : @xmath67 a natural form for the penalty function @xmath68 is given by the integrated square deviation of the line profile @xmath15 from its best fitting gaussian @xmath69 : @xmath70 ^ 2 { \\mathrm{d}}v } { \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\mathcal{g}(v)^2 { \\mathrm{d}}v}. \\label{rms}\\ ] ] this penalty does not suppress noisy solutions , which are already excluded by the use of a low order parametric expansion for @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that in the case where @xmath15 has the form of eq .",
    "( [ losvd ] ) then eq .  (",
    "[ rms ] ) is well approximated by : @xmath71    in principle one could then define the penalty as @xmath72 and optimize @xmath73 ( eq .  [ penchi2 ] ) . in practice",
    "however this is not desirable for two reasons :    * as explained in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] , it is computationally much more efficient to minimize the residuals @xmath26 ( eq .  [ resid ] ) instead of",
    "explicitly compute the @xmath4 ; * one needs a way to automatically adjust the penalty factor @xmath74 according to the @xmath4 of the observed fit .",
    "we found that a simple and effective solution to these problems consists of using the following perturbed residuals as input to the nonlinear least - squares optimizer : @xmath75 where the variance is defined as @xmath76 the qualitative interpretation of this formula is that a deviation @xmath77 of the losvd from a gaussian shape will be accepted as an improvement of the fit , only if it is able to correspondingly decrease the scatter @xmath78 by an amount related to @xmath77 . to quantify one",

    "considering the definition of variance ( eq .  [ var ] ) one can finally write @xmath80 which is of the desired form ( [ penchi2 ] ) with @xmath81 automatically scaled according to the @xmath4 of the fit . in practice @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) is computed using a robust biweight estimator @xcite , so that eq .",
    "( [ chi2p ] ) is only valid as an approximation .",
    "one can see from this formula that , with @xmath82 , a deviation @xmath83 of the losvd from a gaussian ( e.g. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) requires a corresponding decrease in the scatter @xmath78 of the unperturbed residuals by more than @xmath86 to be accepted by the optimization routine as an improvement of the fit .    a statistical interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ chi2p ] ) can be obtained by considering that for a good fit @xmath87 . for a given @xmath88 a deviation @xmath77 from a gaussian",
    "needs to decrease @xmath4 by more than @xmath89 to be accepted , and this variation can be associated to a specific confidence level ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at which a gaussian shape is excluded .",
    "although this formula may serve as a guideline , we believe it is safer to test a choice of @xmath88 using simulations as the ones presented .    a test of the application of eq .",

    "the losvd converges towards a gaussian and , as expected , the bias becomes similar to fig .",
    "[ v_sigma ] .",
    "however the _ crucial _ difference with the previous case consists of the fact that for higher @xmath56 the solution tends to converge to the known best fitting values , due to the fact that the penalty scales with the @xmath4 .",
    "we mention here that alternative forms to eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) are possible , with the requirement that the objective function has the form ( [ penchi2 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is to include a multiplicative perturbation of the residuals : @xmath92 in this case the objective function becomes @xmath93 and if one neglects the small term containing @xmath94 , this becomes again of the form ( [ penchi2 ] ) , with @xmath95 .",

    "( [ pert ] ) , if the same @xmath74 parameter is adopted .",
    "we prefer the perturbation ( [ pert ] ) given its robustness against outliers , due to the use of the biweight in the computation of @xmath78 .",

    "the data cube was spatially binned to a minimum @xmath52 using the voronoi 2d - binning method by @xcite .",
    "the same differences that we observed using synthetic model spectra can also be seen from real data :    * the gauss - hermite parameters are everywhere significantly suppressed when fitting @xmath60 and @xmath61 first ( top panels ) ; * the simultaneous fit of all parameters ( middle panels ) tends to produce a velocity dispersion map which is noisier and has smaller values , while @xmath48 tends to be strongly positive .",

    "it may be worth emphasizing that , when computing monte carlo errors , one has to correct for the bias in the measurements , introduced by the noise suppression mechanism . failure to correct for the bias in the kinematics can provide a significant underestimation of the confidence intervals of parameters determined by fitting dynamical models to the data .",
