    "it is well known  @xcite that the perturbative treatment of fluctuation corrections to bogoliubov s mean - field theory  @xcite for interacting bosons is plagued by infrared divergencies , which appear at zero temperature for dimensions @xmath13 , and at finite temperature for @xmath14 .",
    "the physical origin of these divergences is the coupling between transverse and longitudinal fluctuations  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the anomalous part of the single - particle self - energy @xmath15 at vanishing momentum and frequency is exactly zero @xcite , whereas bogoliubov s mean - field theory predicts that @xmath15 is finite . to recover the exact result @xmath16 diagrammatically",
    ", infinite orders have to be re - summed using non - perturbative methods , such as the renormalization group .",
    "@xcite    if one is interested in long - wavelength and low - energy properties of the system , popov s quantum hydrodynamic approach@xcite offers an alternative parametrization of the fluctuations which does not lead to infrared divergencies . in this approach one separates the low - energy from the high - energy modes and treats the low - energy sector within a gradient expansion for the phase and amplitude fluctuations .",
    "this hydrodynamic approach can also be used to study interacting bosons in one spatial dimension , where strong fluctuations prohibit the formation of a bose - einstein condensate@xcite , although the groundstate is superfluid . in fact , in one dimension the weak coupling expansion of thermodynamic quantities obtained within the hydrodynamic approach agrees with exact results for the lieb - liniger model@xcite up to the second order in the relevant dimensionless interaction parameter@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the single - particle spectral function and the dynamic structure factor ( spectral function for density fluctuations ) of interacting bosons in one dimension have recently been shown to exhibit algebraic singularities.@xcite in principle it should be possible to reproduce these singularities within the hydrodynamic approach , but this requires a non - perturbative treatment of the interactions between amplitude and phase fluctuations which is beyond the scope of this work .    here",
    "we shall use the hydrodynamic approach to calculate the damping of phase fluctuations in low dimensional bose gases . in one dimension",

    "<S> using popov s hydrodynamic approach we derive an effective euclidean action for the long - wavelength phase fluctuations of superfluid bose gases in @xmath0 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this action to calculate the damping of phase fluctuations at zero temperature as a function of @xmath0 . for @xmath1 and wavevectors @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the mass of the bosons and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is the sound velocity ) we find that the damping in units of the phonon energy @xmath5 is to leading order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the boson density and @xmath8 is the inverse healing length . </S>",
