    "of all the cosmologically important sources of cp discussed in this paper , cp due to the pop iii stars dominate with a significantly higher signal in the frequency range of interest .",
    "a detailed description of the mechanisms that produce cp in various sources are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : transfer ] .",
    "cp in the cmb is produced by the pop iii stars via the fc mechanism which transforms an incoming linear polarization into circular polarization in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "an important foreground to the cp observation is the galactic cp due to the gse , which is naturally ( intrinsically ) circularly polarized .",
    "we evaluate the signal level of the cp generated from the gse using numerical simulations generated by the @xmath123 code where we have implemented the calculation of stokes v ( component corresponding to cp ) following eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsync ] ) .",
    "the goal frequency of observation is in the 5 - 30 ghz range which is chosen due to the reasons described earlier in this section .",
    "there is not much known about the mass and other properties of the pop iii stars .",
    "if the number of pop iii stars per halo is as high as 1000 , then observations at higher frequency ( of up to 50 ghz ) could lead to a s / n higher than unity .",
    "the final result of our work is summarized in fig .",
    "( [ fig : snr_grid1]-[fig : snr_grid1_dg ] ) .",
    "a s / n significantly higher than unity is achievable if n@xmath11 @xmath12 100 .",
    "generally , a s / n higher than unity is accessible if n@xmath11 @xmath12 10 , with an appropriately chosen frequency of observation and beam resolution . under the most optimistic scenario ( for example , n@xmath11=1000 ) ,",
    "a s / n higher than unity is accessible at @xmath42=50 ghz with beam resolution of up to 40. under the least optimistic scenario , when n@xmath11=1 , we do not expect a s / n higher than unity",
    ".    limitations of our results come from the current status of the gmf models .",
    "our results for the galactic foreground in cp is based on numerical simulations which are partially driven by galactic synchrotron and low frequency cmb data .",
    "the gmf models considered in this paper are compared with haslam data ( 408 mhz map ) , low frequency cmb data from planck and wmap satellites .",
    "however , the resolution of these datasets are at best 40-1@xmath9 , limiting our knowledge of the gmf at smaller scales . maps of stokes v presented in this paper depend on the gmf models we have adopted , which need to be improved to produce the accurate maps of the gse which match the observations more closely .",
    "this will also improve the stokes v maps .",
    "finally , there is no observed maps of the galactic cp .",
    "an all - sky map of the observed galactic cp will reveal the nature of the gmf in greater detail , verify the theoretical predictions on cp from the polarization transfer equations and yield foregrounds levels to the measurements of the cosmic cp .",
    "a low frequency measurement of the cosmic cp in the cmb can reveal information about the pop iii stars , early universe symmetry breaking or new physics , galaxy clusters or even the primordial magnetic field .",
    "the signal from the pop iii stars are particularly interesting due to their expected high signal level and consequently , significantly high s / n .",
    "observing cp in the cmb will be an indirect probe of the pop iii stars which are highly significant as the first formed structures since the cosmic dark ages and seeds of reionization of the universe .",
    "not much is known about the pop iii stars currently .",
    "direct observation of these high redshift objects ( z @xmath12 15 ) are generally beyond the reach of future telescopes like the jwst . observing the cp induced in the cmb provides a much economical way of learning about the existence and nature of the pop iii stars , which can even be realized in the immediate future . with the current status of instrumentation ,",
    "observing cp of the cmb provides the highest promise in probing the pop iii stars .",
    "if the instrumentation is improved in the near future , new physics related signal can also be explored which currently remains far out of the reach of the highly expensive modern day accelerators .",
    "finally , an immediate practical significance of this work is towards the cosmic b - mode exploration .",
    "this applies to the telescopes that are now being built and propose to explore primordial b - modes using vpm techniques .",
    "the observing strategy relies on using cp as a systematics rejections channel .",
    "this work points out that the galactic cp effects are important in large scales , especially for frequencies below 50 ghz .",
