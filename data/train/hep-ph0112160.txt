    "the historical observation of neutrinos from the supernova ( sn ) 1987a at the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite detectors had a great impact and confirmed the basic picture of stellar collapse and sn explosion  @xcite . however , the number of observed events was too small to draw definite conclusions about the explosion mechanism or detailed properties of sn neutrinos .",
    "hopefully , the next sn in our galaxy will be detected by several massive neutrino detectors , currently operating or planned .",
    "such observations of neutrinos from a galactic sn should provide us a far more detailed information on properties of sn neutrinos , as well as the newly formed neutron star , thus bringing substantial progress to our understanding of stellar collapse .",
    "the discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at super - kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite implies that neutrinos have masses and different neutrino flavors mix , and it is supported by the results from the first long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment , k2k @xcite .",
    "moreover , a clear evidence for solar neutrino oscillations into mu / tau neutrinos has been obtained by combining the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) charged current ( cc ) measurement @xcite with elastic scattering measurement at sk @xcite and the most recent _ in situ _ cc and neutral current ( nc ) measurements at sno @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations add a new `` complication '' to the diagnostics of sn neutrinos , since it is no longer true that a neutrino @xmath1 leaving the neutrinosphere with definite flavor @xmath2 will be detected on earth as the same neutrino species .",
    "then , the task of extracting information such as the original of neutrino spectra in the sn core from terrestrial observations , requires solving an `` inverse problem '' .    in this letter , we point out that rather than a `` complication '' the neutrino oscillation provides a new powerful tool for probing otherwise inaccessible features of sn neutrino spectra .",
    "this holds if the mixing angle responsible for the solar neutrino oscillation is large @xcite as clearly indicated by the current solar neutrino data .",
    "we show that a high statistics observation of @xmath3 through the cc reaction @xmath4 will enable us to extract not only the original temperature of @xmath3 but also that of @xmath5 at the neutrinosphere , as well as their time integrated luminosities . in order to determine these parameters we employ a @xmath6 method to `` separate '' two different neutrino spectra at the neutrinosphere with different temperatures and luminosities .",
    "hereafter we use a collective notation @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath9 ( @xmath5 ) because they can not be distinguished by their physical properties inside the sn .",
    "we focus on @xmath3 observation for the following reasons : ( i ) this is expected to be the channel with highest statistics in a large water cerenkov detectors such as sk , hyper - kamiokande ( hk ) or uno detectors , which are under consideration  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos from a galactic sn at 10 kpc would produce 7000 - 10000 events at sk and 2 - 3 @xmath10 events at hk  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the large solar neutrino mixing angle necessarily implies that the @xmath3 spectrum observed at the earth is a strong mixture of two originally different sn neutrino spectra of @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "this fact has been used to derive various constraints on neutrino mixing parameters  @xcite .",
    "complementary information may be obtained also through direct detection of @xmath8 through the nc reaction either at sno or kamland  @xcite .",
    "in addition to generic features of sn neutrino spectra obtained in sn simulations  @xcite we will take into account some new features indicated by recent studies .",
    "most importantly , they include a new parameter which characterize the departure from the equipartition of integrated luminosities to electron and other flavor neutrinos , the quantity of greatest uncertainty in sn simulations .",
    "( see below . )",
    "we now briefly summarize the features of neutrino spectra relevant for our work . in a sn explosion driven by gravitational collapse ,",
    "about 99 % of the total binding energy of the neutron star , @xmath11 erg , is released in the form of neutrinos during the first @xmath12 seconds after the onset of core collapse .",
    "it is well known that the time - dependent energy spectrum of each neutrino species can be approximated by a `` pinched '' fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution @xcite . in this work , we assume that the time - integrated spectra can also be well approximated by the pinched fd distributions with an effective degeneracy parameter @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the neutrino energy , and @xmath16 the effective temperature . we have checked the validity of this approximation by using results of 20 @xmath17 simulation by mayle and wilson @xcite ; we take in our analysis @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath3 and @xmath8 , respectively , which reproduce well the time - integrated spectra .    because of the hierarchy in strength of interactions with the surrounding matter neutrino temperatures obey @xmath20 as confirmed by various sn simulations .",
    "typical values of the average energies of the time - integrated neutrino spectra obtained are @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev .",
    "we introduce , for later use , a new parameter @xmath24 which is defined as the ratio of the average energies of the time - integrated neutrino spectra , @xmath25 sn simulations indicate @xmath26 .",
    "recent studies and sn simulations indicate various new features which were not taken into account in previous studies .",
    "there are three effects at least .",
    "the first is the possibility of a gross violation of equality in integrated luminosities of @xmath27 and @xmath28 by up to @xmath29 % @xcite .",
    "the second is a violation of equality of physical properties of @xmath7 to @xmath8 due to the effects of weak magnetism  @xcite .",
    "the third is possible difference in integrated luminosity between @xmath3 and @xmath30 @xcite",
    ".    the actual situation regarding violation of equipartition can be less dramatic since the @xmath31 annihilation process enhances the @xmath7/@xmath8 luminosity , as recently shown by buras _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . however , we prefer to introduce a free fit parameter @xmath32 defined as a ratio of integrated luminosities of @xmath33 to @xmath3 ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the equipartition limit .",
    "it quantifies the departure from equipartition of integrated luminosities to @xmath3 and @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "we ignore the latter two effects in this paper .",
    "we feel that taking into account the uncertainly in @xmath32 gives us a reasonable framework at least as a first approximation ; the other effects are not very sizable , @xmath37 % , and may cancel with each other , e.g. , effects of @xcite and @xcite on temperatures of @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we treat @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 as free fit parameters .",
    "taking the best - fit values of mixing parameters from the latest analysis of the solar neutrino data  @xcite , we compute the conversion probability for @xmath42 oscillations in the sn envelope , following the prescription in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming an approximate power - law density profile , @xmath43 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect possible earth matter effects  @xcite which will depend on the location of the detectors . in the context of three - neutrino flavor mixing",
    ", our treatment applies to the normal mass ordering ( @xmath44 ) and the inverted mass ordering ( @xmath45 ) with non - adiabatic high - density resonance @xcite , where @xmath46 denotes the atmospheric neutrino mass squared difference .",
    "further implications of our proposal for the case of generic three flavor mixing will be given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we take , for definiteness , the sk and the hk detectors and assume their fiducial volumes as 32 kton and 1 mton , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath3 s will come from a galactic sn located at 10 kpc from the earth .",
    "we only consider @xmath3 cc reaction on proton and neglect contribution from @xmath47 elastic scattering and cc reactions on oxygen in our analysis . it should give a good approximation because these processes have very small cross sections .",
    "the effect of weak magnetism is taken into account @xcite . without knowing the detection efficiency and energy resolution expected at hk",
    ", we assume that they are the same as those in sk and set the threshold energy to 5 mev @xcite . lacking real galactic sn neutrino data at hand",
    ", we generate an artificial data set by adopting the model spectra as described before .",
    "we first define arbitrarily a set of initial values for the four relevant astrophysical sn parameters @xmath48 as `` true values '' given by nature .",
    "the data thus generated , @xmath49 , are taken as the `` observed '' values . to quantify how well a single fd distribution can be discriminated from a superposition of two fd distributions we employ a @xmath6 minimization fit in the space of four astrophysical parameters @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath6 function is defined as @xmath51\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 . for simplicity ,",
    "we present below the results obtained when event - by - event fluctuations of the artificial data set are neglected .",
    "however , we have explicitly verified that our results agree well with the ones obtained by generating 10,000 sets of gaussian fluctuated data .",
    "current solar neutrino data strongly favor the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution .",
    "therefore , we focus on the lma solution",
    ". it also gives a conservative estimate of the oscillation effect compared to the low and the vac solutions because the effect is larger for larger mixing angles .",
    "we show in fig . [ fvsnf1 ]",
    "the @xmath53 c.l . allowed parameter region obtained in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 planes for sk and hk detectors by assuming the lma solution , taking the best - fit value for mixing angle , @xmath56 0.42  @xcite .",
    "we also present results for the no - oscillation case for comparison .",
    "we set the initial astrophysical parameters as @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 = 1.4 , @xmath59 erg , and @xmath60 = 0.5 .",
    "[ fvsnf1 ] demonstrates that we can extract the both @xmath3 and @xmath33 temperatures in the presence of large mixing oscillations .",
    "the accuracies we can achieve with the lma best - fit parameters are @xmath61 9 ( 1.5 ) % , @xmath62 4 ( 1 ) in contrast , in the absence of oscillation there is no sensitivity in @xmath63 due to the inability of determining @xmath64 and @xmath33 luminosities .",
    "the improvement in the accuracy of the determination of these quantities for the oscillation case is remarkable , especially with hk .",
    "let us now examine how accurately we can determine the equipartition - violation parameter @xmath32 and its correlation with @xmath24 and @xmath63 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fvsnf2 ] .",
    "we note that the accuracy of @xmath24 determination is remarkably good in spite of the rather poor accuracy in the knowledge of @xmath32",
    ". it should be noticed that fig .",
    "[ fvsnf2 ] demonstrates that hk can do a much better job for @xmath32 , @xmath65 10 % .",
    "we emphasize that without having sensitivity to @xmath32 we can not determine @xmath63 in a good accuracy , as they are strongly correlated ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fvsnf2 ] . )",
    "we finally note that hk s enormous sensitivity @xmath12 % may mean one could potentially examine the problem by treating accreting and thermal phase separately under the present approximations .",
    "the negative correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath24 can be understood due to the fact that the effect of lowering @xmath32 , which implies a decrease of the relative contribution of @xmath33 , can be compensated by increasing @xmath24 to keep the higher energy tail of the observed spectrum similar . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong positive correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath63 just reflects the relationship @xmath66 , which is valid under our approximation @xmath67 .",
    "the correlation is robust and exists with and without oscillations as indicated in fig .  2 .",
    "we have also examined the case of a smaller value of the initial @xmath33 energy , @xmath58 = 1.25 to verify the robustness of our results .",
    "we found that although the sensitivity to @xmath63 determination worsens by a factor of @xmath68 2 , we still have a reasonable sensitivity to @xmath24 , @xmath61 14 % ( 2.5 % for hk ) , excluding the case of @xmath24 = 1 at 3 @xmath69 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we have verified that our results do not change very much even if we relax our assumptions by taking into account deviations from power - law density profile of progenitor star , or from the precise best - fit values of solar neutrino mixing parameters we have adopted .",
    "the inclusion of possible earth matter effects for a given experiment will imply some regeneration effect .",
    "although this will somewhat weaken our results , the effect is rather small in practice .",
    "additional details related to the robustness of our method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have suggested a simple but powerful way of extracting separately the temperatures of both @xmath3 and @xmath5 as well as their integrated luminosities by analyzing @xmath3 events that would be recorded by massive water cherenkov detectors in the event of a galactic supernova explosion . in particular , an extraordinary power of megaton - class detectors ( hyper - kamiokande or uno ) are noticed with regard to the determination of the integrated luminosities of @xmath3 and @xmath5 as independent fit parameters .",
    "we stress that the large mixing between @xmath30 and @xmath9 , which is clearly indicated by the current solar neutrino data , is essential in determining temperature as well as luminosity of @xmath5 , and this must have more profound implications which await further investigation .        when the first version of this paper was ready for submission to the electronic archive we became aware of the paper by barger _",
    "@xcite who pursued the similar strategy as ours",
    ". however , they do not treat the violation of equipartition of energies as a fit parameter .",
