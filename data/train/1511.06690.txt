    "since for large @xmath87 , the pair dispersion approaches a linear increase with time ( @xmath91 ) , we define the long - term effective diffusivity in the system as @xmath92 setting the denominator to @xmath93 ( instead of @xmath94 ) takes into account that , for very long times , dispersion is dominated by the two horizontal components of the particle separations .",

    "the effective particle transport is dominated by the pattern dynamics and much faster for very active spiral defect chaos , whereas at a high particle diffusivities , we find @xmath103 regardless of the underlying flow pattern .",
    "the transition point depends strongly on the rayleigh number .",
    "we note that this effect can not be attributed to the effects of a generally faster advection speed @xmath104 at higher @xmath10 , but rather the additional effect of the changes in the convection pattern : the general behavior of @xmath95 remains unchanged when we normalize diffusivities by the advection velocities ( i.e. express @xmath22 via the pclet number @xmath105 ) .",
    "we have resolved particle dispersion in spiral defect chaos for very short times . on these time scales , we find that dispersion is accelerated by the shear in the flow field .",
    "particle dispersion scales with @xmath0 , which leads to a quick mixing of the diffusing particles throughout a convection roll .    diffusion in a shear flow reproduces all characteristics of the short - term behavior of dispersion in the convective system : for very small times , we find 3d normal diffusion with @xmath106 the transition to the richardson - like @xmath0-scaling occurs when the two terms @xmath107 and @xmath108 have the same order of magnitude , i.e. around @xmath109 .",
    "this transition point only depends on the vorticity @xmath110 and is independent of the particle diffusivity .",
    "afterwards , the @xmath0-term dominates , and we find @xmath111 due to the presence of top and bottom boundaries , the steep increase in dispersion is limited . when the separation distance of two particles is on the order of @xmath14 , the velocity field can not be modeled by a shear flow anymore , and the fast dispersion mechanism breaks down .",
    "recently , benveniste and drivas@xcite have investigated backwards dispersion of diffusing particles in turbulent flow . applying their calculation to the shear flow @xmath112 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : cgvf ] ) at viscosity @xmath7 predicts a backwards dispersion of @xmath113 for particles of diffusivity @xmath114 , with a mean dissipation @xmath115 .",
    "since the simple shear flow is independent of viscosity , this result for backwards dispersion can be applied to any diffusivity and matches our description for the forward dispersion at intermediate times .",
    "when pair separation reaches the length scale of the system height , the transition between the rolls becomes relevant for transport , a model for which has been suggested by shraiman @xcite . in accordance to that model , impurities in a rayleigh - bnard pattern of",
    "parallel , straight convection rolls have been found to spread throughout the rolls like in a normal diffusive process , albeit with an increased effective diffusion @xcite .",
    "we find that this is also true for particles in spiral defect chaos , where rolls are not stationary and the flow field is truly three - dimensional .    for small particle diffusivities ,",
    "the effective diffusivity goes like @xmath103 , as has been observed numerically and experimentally by gollub and solomon@xcite in a system of stationary convection rolls .",
    "when increasing the particle diffusivity , the dependence of the effective diffusivity on the particles diffusivities vanishes , and the dispersion appears characteristic to the flow pattern itself .",
    "our results complement the findings of chiam @xcite , who studied the enhancement of scalar diffusion in a similar system of spiral defect chaos in terms of the pclet number @xmath116 , and found a transition in scaling behavior at @xmath117 for @xmath6 and higher .",
    "this transition hints towards a two - fold effect of the stochastic fluid motion on particle dispersion : one part that dominates when particle diffusivity is small , and disperses particles purely by advecting them ; and a second part that results from the interplay of advection and particle diffusion , which dominates at higher particle diffusivities ( corresponding to lower pclet numbers ) .",
    "we found that the richardson - like @xmath0 scaling of pair dispersion known from fully developed turbulence also occurs in laminar thermal convection flow , if the effects of the stochastic turbulent motion are replaced by a particle diffusivity @xmath22 . unlike in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ,",
    "the size of the vortex structures in rayleigh - bnard convection is fixed , creating an upper bound to the quick vertical dispersion .    due to the strong difference in the transport mechanisms before and after the transition from 3d motion to effectively 2d motion ,",
    "this transition can be clearly observed in the dispersion as a plateau .",
    "if the large - scale flow pattern shows strong enough variations in time , we find that dispersion loses its dependence on the local details of stochastic motion , and depends only on the orientation pattern of the convection rolls , the correlation distance of which is small in spiral defect chaos ( i.e. on the order of a few roll diameters ) .",
    "this strong cutoff in correlation length is specific to the vertically restricted systems and does not occur in fully developed 3d turbulence .",
    "it remains an open question how exactly the long - term dispersion can be described in terms of the pattern dynamics and correlation properties of the flow pattern , and whether a @xmath22-independent effective diffusivity @xmath95 can also be found at lower rayleigh numbers , when only few dislocations are present . since larger correlation lengths in the pattern require longer observations and larger system sizes , the simulation efforts are very high for these systems .",
