    "we discussed the two - level dynamics analytically in the weak field limit , where a phase sensitivity of the inversion could only be found for pulses with phase dependent power spectrum . beyond the linear regime ,",
    "the phase sensitivity of @xmath31 was studied numerically for excitation with rectangular and sinc - shaped pulses . for the rectangular pulse ,",
    "it was furthermore proven that the modulation depth @xmath152 does not depend on the pulse length , and an approximate analytical expression for @xmath110 was derived applying almost degenerate perturbation theory .",
