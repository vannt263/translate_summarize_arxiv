    "follow - up observations of the three extra - galactic sources and two of the galactic sources were made using the sest telescope at la silla observatory in chile , january 8 - 10 , 2000 .",
    "a list of sources and coordinates are given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the boomerang telescope features a 1.2 m primary mirror and a cryogenic bolometric array receiver .",

    "interspersed between cmb observations are observations of the galactic plane .",
    "the galactic sources were observed at the same scan speeds as the cmb observations , but with shorter scans ( 10 degrees peak - to - peak in azimuth for the source scans vs. 60 degrees peak - to - peak for the cmb scans ) . in total",
    "there were 15 galactic source scans : one of the carina nebula , four of rcw38 , four of iras1022 , five of iras08576 and one which included both ngc3603 and ngc3576 .",
    "nearly ( but not quite ) all of the data for all of the detectors was good for each scan ; table [ tbl1 ] lists the number of good observations ( which includes the number of good scans and channels ) at each frequency .",
    "scans of the galactic sources were flagged as bad for a particular channel for example if the source was on the edge of the scan in that channel .",

    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 flux results are systematically dependent on beam at approximately the 10% and 5% level , respectively .",
    "the fluxes are dependent on background subtraction at about the 1% level .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux due to the inherent s / n of the data is approximately 2% .",
    "since the s / n on the extra - galactic sources is much lower than the s / n on the galactic sources , maps are not used in this analysis ; fluxes are computed directly by binning the timestream data in radius , after filtering at 0.2 hz .",
    "since there are relatively few observations of each source ( see table [ tbl1 ] ) and since the s / n of each observation is low , _ weighted _ means and standard deviations are given in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "background subtraction systematically affects the 1@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 fluxes by about 10% and 25% respectively .",

    "in addition to the analysis in the previous section , a wavelet approach is also used , following vielva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , to evaluate the fluxes and the spectral indices for the three extra - galactic point sources observed by boomerang .",
    "the main advantages of using this method are the amplification of the signal to noise ratio and that the result is only sensitive to sources of size equal to or smaller than the beam , so the measured fluxes are much less affected by the background signal .",
    "the isotropic wavelet transform for a two - dimensional map @xmath17 is defined by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wavelet coefficient of the map @xmath20 associated with a scale @xmath21 and centered at the point @xmath22 .",

    "the fwhm of the sest 90 ghz beam is 57 arcsec , the fwhm of the sest 150 ghz beam is 35 arcsec and the chop is 11 arcmin .",
    "calibration was done using the chopper wheel method .",
    "the antenna temperature scale , given in @xmath36 , was converted to a flux density scale through observations of planets ( sest web page ) .    for the galactic sources ngc3576 and rcw38",
    ", observations were made in a region 4x4 in extent centered on each source with a grid spacing of 17.5 arcsec ( hereafter center maps ) .",
    "additional observations were made with a wider grid spacing ( 35 arcsec ) covering a larger region around each source ( 10 arcmin x 10 arcmin in extent for ngc3576 , 6 arcmin x 6 arcmin in extent for rcw38 ) ( hereafter extended maps ) .",
    "for rcw38 , the more extended of the two sources , the center and extended observations were combined . for ncg3576",
    "only the center maps were used , since the data far from the source are noisy or could be contaminated by objects outside the field .",
    "maps are shown in figure [ fig3 ] and fluxes are given in table [ tbl5 ] .",
    "again , maps are a flat - space projection centered on the source , as in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ". fluxes for rcw38 and ngc3576 are computed within the map regions .",
    "fluxes for the extra - galactic sources are from point source observations .",
    "spectral indices are computed from the fluxes using eq .",
    "[ eq : specindex ] and are also given in table [ tbl5 ] .",
    "the sest observations can be convolved with the boomerang beam in order to check the boomerang calibration . for rcw38 and ngc3576 ,",
    "the sest maps are convolved with the boomerang beam and flux profiles are obtained from the convolved maps .",
    "a numerical convolution is not necessary for the extra - galactic sources since the analytic convolution of a point source with a gaussian is simple ; the 1 @xmath8 and 2 @xmath8 fluxes should be 0.393 and 0.865 of the point source flux .",
    "flux ratios are given in table [ tbl6 ] , where the boomerang fluxes used are those from table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the extra - galactic sources may be time variable , and since the boomerang and sest observations were made approximately a year apart , they could have different intensities not only because of calibration but because of intensity variations . from a weighted mean of the numbers in table [ tbl6 ] , the current boomerang calibration relative to sest is 0.97@xmath00.07 for the 90 ghz channels and 1.04@xmath00.06 for the 150 ghz channels .",
    "in other words , the boomerang and sest calibrations agree with each other to within the uncertainties .",
    "the mat team has published fluxes for ngc3576 at 150ghz ( puchalla et al .",
    "2002 ) . for mat , @xmath37 = 5.16 arcmin .",
    "the ratio mat/(sest*mat ) for the ngc3576 150 ghz observations is 1.01@xmath00.14 and 1.00@xmath00.15 for their @xmath38 and @xmath39 fluxes respectively , implying that sest and mat agree well .",
    "therefore , the calibrations of boomerang , sest and mat are all consistent for ngc3576 at 150 ghz .",
    "a comparison with the sest data for the galactic sources ngc3576 , rcw38 and extra - galactic sources 0537 - 441 , 0521 - 365 and 0438 - 43 implies that the current boomerang calibration and sest agree to within 8% at 90 ghz and 6% at 150 ghz .",
    "additionally , boomerang , mat , and sest fluxes of ngc3576 at 150 ghz are all consistent with each other .",
    "the galactic sources typically show a flat to inverted spectrum from 90 to 150 ghz and a rising spectrum from 150 to 240 ghz and from 240 to 400 ghz .",
    "this is consistent with a combination of free - free and dust emission , with free - free dominating at the lower frequencies and dust dominating at higher frequencies .",
    "our spectral indices are consistent with the typical @xmath40 expected for millimeter observations of hii regions .",
    "while the uncertainties on the spectral indices of the extra - galactic sources from boomerang are large , the sest measurements imply a falling spectrum with increasing frequency . to place these measurements in context ,",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the extra - galactic source fluxes along with measurements from a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
