    "quantum systems are typically subjected to the interaction with an environment which influences their dynamics in a non negligible way .",
    "a realistic description , taking this external influence into account , is crucial for the theoretical description of open quantum systems , which play an important role in many areas of physics @xcite .",
    "the available theoretical tools allow a full characterization for a markovian dynamics , which can be described by means of completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups @xcite .",
    "however , the assumptions justifying the markovian description of the open system dynamics are often too restrictive , and a more general analysis is required . a wealth of different approaches to deal with non - markovian dynamics have been introduced @xcite , but they typically rely on the hypothesis that at the initial time the open system and the environment are statistically independent . this assumption is well justified in the case of weak interaction , but in general one can not neglect the initial correlations between the open system and the environment @xcite .    considering an open system @xmath0 which is coupled to an environment @xmath1 and assuming that the composite system evolves according to a unitary time evolution operator @xmath2 from a total initial state @xmath3 , we can write the state of @xmath0 at time @xmath4 as follows , @xmath5 .",

    "one derives the general mathematical structure of its generator , which leads to the widely - used quantum markovian master equations for the open system state @xmath14 in lindblad form .",
    "the above construction of the quantum dynamical map @xmath11 presupposes that one restricts the class of initial conditions to states of the form of eq .  , where @xmath10 is a fixed , given environmental state .",
    "thus , a large class of initial conditions is excluded when considering dynamical maps acting on the reduced state space , in particular those initial conditions that describe correlations and entanglement between system and environment . on the other hand , it is a well known fact that correlations in the initial state can have strong influences on the open system dynamics , both in thermal equilibrium and in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "the question is thus , how do initial correlations affect the reduced system dynamics , and what are appropriate observable measures that quantify such effects ? here , we discuss these questions in detail with the help of the example of the jaynes - cummings model , the model of a two - state system coupled to a bosonic field mode , employing the analytical representation of the reduced dynamics of this model for arbitrary initial states @xcite .",

    ", this construction demands that the initial correlations between the system and its environment are fixed .",
    "it turns out that the dynamical maps arising in this way may be not completely positive , and not even positive .",
    "this requires the determination of a certain compatibility domain in the physical state space , which is a very complicated mathematical task . in the present paper",
    "we shall follow an entirely different strategy , to analyze the role of initial correlations .",
    "namely , in order to quantify the effect of initial system - environment correlations in the subsequent time evolution of the open system , we will investigate the trace distance @xmath15 between a pair of states @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath0 , which evolve from a given pair of initial states @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the total system .",
    "this approach has also been used in @xcite to construct a measure for the non - markovianity of quantum processes , and in @xcite to develop a witness which allows the detection of initial correlations through only local measurements on the open system .",
    "an application to a specific system has been recently considered in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will address , in particular , the situation in which @xmath20 represents a thermal equilibrium ( gibbs ) state corresponding to the full hamiltonian of the model .",
    "since this correlated state is invariant under the time evolution , its reduced states @xmath21 and @xmath22 remain of course time independent .",
    "however , the initial state @xmath23 given by the product of the marginals does evolve in time , and we will investigate the dynamics of the trace distance @xmath15 between the open system states corresponding to the initial states @xmath20 and @xmath24 . for this case",
    "the trace distance is bounded from above by the trace distance @xmath25 which provides a measure for the amount of correlations in the initial gibbs state @xcite . analyzing in detail the dependence on the temperature and on the system - environment coupling strength ,",
    "we demonstrate that at small temperatures characteristic properties of these correlations are related to the eigenvalue spectrum and , in particular , to the quantum correlations and the entanglement structure of the eigenstates of @xmath26 .",
    "we will discuss further the signatures of these properties in the subsequent dynamics of the open system states .",
    "it will be shown that , in fact , the open system dynamically uncovers typical features of the correlations in the initial states .",

    "[ sec : trace - dist - init ] we introduce the trace distance and show its relevance as a measure of the distinguishability of two quantum states and of the correlations contained in a given bipartite state .",

    "[ sec : gibbs ] we provide a detailed study of the correlations contained in the gibbs state associated to the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , as measured by the trace distance between the state and the tensor product of its marginals .",
    "we then investigate the time dependence of the distinguishability of the corresponding time evolved states .",

    "she gives the system to bob , who performs a measurement in order to distinguish the two states .",

    "one can show that the maximal success probability for bob to identify correctly the state is given by @xmath51/2 $ ] .",
    "this means that the trace distance represents the maximal bias in favor of the correct state identification which bob can achieve through an optimal strategy .",
    "hence , the trace distance @xmath52 can be interpreted as a measure for the distinguishability of the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "for @xmath62 the trace distance of the open system states can increase over its initial value .",
    "this increase can be interpreted by saying that information which is initially outside the open system flows back to the system and becomes accessible through local measurements .",
    "note that , as will be illustrated by means of several examples below , the bound for the dynamics of the trace distance given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : laine ] ) is tight , i.e. , it can be reached for certain total initial states . if the bound of inequality ( [ eq : laine ] ) is actually reached at some time @xmath4 , the initial distinguishability of the total system states is equal to the distinguishability of the open system states at time @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the relative information on the total initial states has been dynamically transferred completely to the open system @xcite .    using the sub - additivity of the trace distance and the triangular inequality one deduces from ( [ eq : laine ] ) the following inequality",

    "( [ fig:4 ] ) and ( [ fig:7 ] ) , we see that in the limit of zero temperature the bound and the true supremum of the trace distance both show a sudden increase and subsequent dips at the same values of the coupling constant @xmath177 .",

    "can be traced back uniquely to discontinuous changes in the structure of the total system s ground state and to its degree of entanglement which , in turn , is caused by crossings of the energy levels of the total system hamiltonian .",
    "it is important to remark that , as we have demonstrated , clear signatures of these discontinuities are still present at finite temperatures . note that to reconstruct the trace distance dynamics , in order to detect correlation properties of the ground state , one only needs to follow the evolution of the open system state obtained from the initial total product state @xmath66 .",

    "finally , we note that it must be expected that the general features found here for the correlated gibbs state hold true also for other correlated initial states , e.g. , for correlated non - equilibrium stationary states , as long as the latter involve discontinuous , qualitative changes under the variation of some system parameters .    financial support by the ministero dellistruzione , delluniversit e della ricerca ( miur ) , under prin2008 , by the academy of finland ( project 133682 ) , and by the magnus ehrnrooth foundation are gratefully acknowledged .",
