    "mp centauri ( hd 308976 ) is an eclipsing binary , listed in the hd catalog as having a b3 spectral type .",
    "its orbital period of 2.99 days makes it a very difficult target to obtain complete light curves from a single location in one observing season .",
    "it is a member a rare group : massive eclipsing binaries with short orbital periods .",
    "it lies in the galactic plane ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and its eclipsing nature allows for the determination of its absolute parameters and distance , as well as the reddening along the line of sight .",
    "we have obtained @xmath6 photometry over several years and the system was also observed in @xmath7 and @xmath8 by the all sky automated survey ( @xcite ; hereafter asas ) .    as part of a program on early - type overcontact and near - contact binaries , we observed mp cen with the eso la silla 2.2 m telescope and the feros spectrograph at high resolution ( r=48,000 ) in february , 2003 . combining radial velocities from these spectra with the @xmath6 photometry and @xmath7 and @xmath8 data from asas , we present the first comprehensive study of this evolved binary .",
    "gw observed mp cen in 1982 and 1989 using the 24-inch ( 0.6 meter ) telescope and single channel photometers equipped with @xmath6 filters at the mt .",
    "john observatory at lake tekapo , new zealand .",
    "the comparison star used was hd 102139 , for which the simbad database gives a b4 iii spectral type .",
    "a 17 arcsec aperture was used and offset slightly to avoid contamination from nearby companions .",
    "the asas project has also obtained @xmath7 and @xmath8 ccd photometry of mp cen . because the goal is to survey large areas of the sky ,",
    "the asas setup is not optimal for photometry of stars in crowded fields like mp cen .",
    "however , mp cen is the brightest object in the measuring aperture and a proper treatment of the third light ( @xmath9 ) contamination makes it possible to use the asas data .",
    "the scatter in all passbands was about 2% .",
    "seven eso 2.2 m + feros spectra have been secured , in two groups of three spectra each on 2003 feb 23 and 24 near quadratures and a single spectrum on 2004 feb 25 in primary eclipse ( table 1 ) .",
    "the wavelength range of the spectra extends from 3900    to 9200    with @xmath10 and a 1200 second exposure time .",
    "the s / n is evaluated around 5850    and the orbital phase is computed with the ephemeris given in section [ analysis ] .",
    "[ speclist ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     quoted errors are formal 1-@xmath11 errors from the solution .",
    "@xmath9 values are in units of total system light at phase 0.25 .",
    "luminosity errors are estimates based on an uncertainty of 2000 k in the effective temperature of the primary .",
    "the error contributions to the luminosities due to the errors in the radii are more than an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the @xmath12 values are in cgs units .         and",
    "@xmath8 photometry and computed light curves.,width=317 ]        the asas data show that the system has @xmath13 and with the third light correction from our light curve solution , @xmath14 for the binary at maximum brightness . correcting this value for the reddening ( assuming a ratio of total to selective absorption of @xmath15 and our @xmath16 ) , we find that the apparent v magnitude of the binary is 9.08 . using the @xmath7 luminosity ratio @xmath17=0.36 from our light curve solution , this transforms into johnson v magnitudes of @xmath18=9.41 and @xmath19=10.53 . with our log luminosity of @xmath20 for the primary , the distance to the primary amounts to 3.0 kpc using a bolometric correction of -1.75 from @xcite .",
    "the same calculation for the secondary results in the same distance .",
    "we therefore adopt 3.0 kpc as the distance to mp  cen , placing it on the far side of the sagittarius arm .",
    "mp  cen lies in the galactic plane and we can compare our estimate of the reddening with the @xcite extinction maps .",
    "mp cen lies at the boundary of four cells ( 294/-1 , 296/-1 , 297/0 and 292/2 ) .",
    "given the low resolution of the cell boundaries , we can not unambiguousily assign mp cen to a particular cell .",
    "our value of @xmath21=0.30 leads to @xmath22 .",
    "looking at the individual cells , we find    * 294/-1 distance greater than 1 kpc * 296/-1 the distance could be as high as 4 kpc * 297/0 distances from 1 to 4 kpc supported * 292/2 distances from 0.5 to 4 kpc supported    thus , the @xcite maps do not provide a conclusive comparison with our derived distance , but their figure 9 supports the idea that the line of sight to mp cen goes through clouds a and g and just misses clouds l , m and r.",
    "we have presented preliminary values for the parameters of mp  cen based on photometry and limited spectroscopic data .",
    "the masses and radii of the stars , along with the semidetached configuration , indicate that the system is evolved .",
    "the radii , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are consistent with a giant or sub - giant classification for both stars for the derived masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 we have measured implies a conservative mass transfer rate of @xmath28 , making it a fairly active system .",
    "light curve variations from season to season , most likely arising from this mass transfer activity , are apparent in the photometric data .",
    "we also see emission features in our spectra but the limited phase coverage of the spectra makes any discussion of the circumstellar environment little more than speculation at this point .",
    "more extensive spectroscopy and polarimetry will be required to fully map the circumstellar environment of the system .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
