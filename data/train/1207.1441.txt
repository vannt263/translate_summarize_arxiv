    "understanding the unitary dynamics generated by stochastic hamiltonians is of interest from both experimental and fundamental viewpoints . on the experimental side",
    ", the preparation of strongly correlated ground - state wave functions by controlled unitary evolution ( for the purpose of quantum simulations , for example ) is an important goal in cold - atom physics .",
    "however , in any real experiment , the implementation of the desired ( time - independent ) hamiltonian is not perfect and noisy fluctuations are unavoidable .",
    "additionally , prescribed time - dependent protocols ( such as , e.g. , complex optimal control protocols  @xcite ) have inaccuracies , which may be in the form of noisy fluctuations . in such cases , the stochasticity has a detrimental effect , which one needs to minimize .",
    "an in - depth understanding of the effect of noisy hamiltonian evolution is thus crucial for , on one hand , correctly predicting the results of experiments and , on the other hand , designing sophisticated experimental setups , which are robust against the effect of the noise .",
    "@xcite    on the fundamental side , evolution with noisy hamiltonian is a natural extension of the physics of disorder to the time domain .",

    "it is necessary to analyze an ensemble of unitary evolutions characterized by different realization of noise and develop methods for computing ensemble - averaged quantities .",
    "another new question of fundamental interest is understanding the role of different sources of fluctuations . in",
    "stochastically driven systems , the fluctuations of physical observables stem from two distinct sources : ( i ) the classical ( sample - to - sample ) stochastic nature of the driving ( different realizations of noise result in different wave functions ) and ( ii ) inherent quantum fluctuations ( each wave function can be a coherent superposition of eigenstates ) .",
    "our objective in this paper is to ( i ) characterize the effect of the two sources above on energy fluctuations , and ( ii ) understand the effects of such stochastic driving on correlation functions .    in this paper , we consider the following general setup : a quantum system with a local hamiltonian @xmath0 , which depends on some parameter @xmath1 ( such as for example a coupling constant ) .",

    "thus , the quantum evolution creates excitations with respect to the ground state of @xmath9 , increasing the system s energy .",
    "the driving is assumed external , i.e. there is no feedback action from the quantum system on @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in isolation from a thermal environment ( without a mechanism for dissipation ) , the system can absorb energy _",

    "( a ) generically , the former is wider than the latter ( the difference between the two serves as a diagnostic for the significance of quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "( b ) for a luttinger liquid in the thermodynamic limit , the two distribution functions are close ( classical fluctuations dominate ) . ]",
    "the absorbed energy of such noise - driven thermally isolated systems is a _ time - dependent _ random variable @xmath11 ( as opposed to the steady states which emerge in noise - driven systems coupled to a heat bath .",

    "how are the correlation functions affected by this stochastic driving ?    to answer the above questions , we first identify two types of quantum- and noise - averaged moments of energy , which make the notion of a random absorbed energy precise , and , help tease apart the effects of the classical and quantum sources of fluctuations discussed above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we then perform explicit analytical calculations of these moments , as well as different noise - averaged correlation functions , for generic one - dimensional systems described by the luttinger liquid ( ll ) theory .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics of luttinger liquids ( due to deterministic protocols such as interaction quenches ) has been a subject of intense studies with various methods .",
    "@xcite in this work , we consider a ll hamiltonian with a fluctuating ll parameter , i.e. , @xmath14 , and use a method based on the ( first - quantized ) evolution of momentum - mode wave functions , which proves extremely powerful in the analysis of stochastic driving .",
    "our main results are as follows .",

    "we find that , in the thermodynamic limit , the dominant contribution to the energy fluctuations stems from the classical source . in the thermodynamic limit , and in the regime of validity of the ll description , we find a general relationship ( independent of the strength of noise and the luttinger parameter ) between the average and the variance of energy : @xmath24^{2},\\label{eq : main1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a dimensionless function of @xmath26 ( with velocity @xmath27 and lattice spacing @xmath28 set to unity ) , which decays as @xmath29 for large @xmath30 .",

    "we also evaluate certain noise - averaged equal - time correlation functions , and find that in the limit of small absorbed energies , correlation functions scaling as @xmath34 in the ground state , deviate from their ground - state value by amounts proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "interestingly , we are able to find an exact analytical result for the current - current correlation function , @xmath36 which can be written in closed form in terms of the error functions .",
    "let us now discuss the two aforementioned moments of energy . as the evolution with different noise realizations can lead to different pure - state wave functions @xmath37 at time @xmath17 , it is helpful to introduce a wave - function probability distribution @xmath38 , which encodes this stochastic effect .",
    "@xcite the inherent quantum fluctuations , on the other hand , stem from the internal structure of the wave functions , which are , generically , coherent superpositions of all energy eigenstates : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . at @xmath41 ,",

    ", we can consider the fluctuations of the expectation value of energy , @xmath51 , over different realizations of noise , which are characterized by the following moments : @xmath52 as @xmath10 is a quantum - averaged quantity , its fluctuations stem solely from the classical stochastic driving .",

    "@xcite fluctuations of quantities other than energy can be similarly studied by expanding the wave function in the corresponding eigenbasis .",
    "let us now turn to the specific model studied in this paper , namely , a luttinger liquid , which is a universal low - energy description of interacting fermions and bosons in one dimension .",
    "@xcite since a noise - driven dissipationless system can keep absorbing energy , this low - energy description will eventually break down for most experimentally realistic scenarios . in this paper , we focus on dynamics over a finite time scale where the ll description remains valid . notice that such time scales can be extended by decreasing the strength of noise .",

    "the fluctuations of velocity @xmath27 correspond to a trivial rescaling of the hamiltonian , we set @xmath27 to unity throughout this paper .    expanding the hamiltonian   in @xmath64 results in quadratic ( in the bosonic fields ) noise terms .",
    "thus , integrating out the noise at the outset ( as in refs .  )",
    "leads to an interacting ( quartic ) effective action , which is difficult to treat exactly . in our case",
    "it is convenient to use an alternative approach , i.e. , the wave - function approach , which consists of the following steps .",
    "( i ) we parametrize the many - body time - dependent wave function of the system with complex numbers @xmath65 . ( ii )",
    "we transform the time - dependent schrdinger equation to an equation of motion for the parameters above , and then expand these equations in the noise terms to obtain a stochastic langevin equation .",
    "( iii ) we express the observables of interest in terms of the parameters above , and study their stochastic dynamics with the langevin equation .",
    "this method allows us to reduce the quantum dynamics in hilbert space to a set of equations of motion ( in our case langevin equations ) for the parameters .",
    "generically , the number of such parameters grows exponentially with system size , but for exactly solvable models such as luttinger liquids a much smaller number of parameters may be necessary .    for the luttinger liquid above",

    "we then obtain the following nonlinear langevin equation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "note that there is no dissipative term in the above equation . also notice that although different modes are decoupled in the langevin equations above , different @xmath69 evolve with the _ same _ @xmath75",
    ". therefore the many - mode quantities must be computed by taking the noise - induced correlations into account .",
