    "consider the following natural two - player game on an undirected graph .",
    "a token is located at a vertex , and the players take turns to move . a move consists of moving the token along an incident edge to a new vertex that has never been visited before by the token . if a player has no possible move , she loses ( and the other player wins ) .",
    "we call this game * trap * ( since the goal is to trap one s opponent )",
    ".    we are concerned with optimal play .",
    "thus , a * strategy * for the first or second player is a map that assigns a legal next move ( where one exists ) to each position .",
    "( a position comprises a location of the token and a set of visited vertices . ) given a graph and an * initial vertex * ( at which the token starts ) , we say that the game is a * win * for the first or second player respectively if that player has a * winning * strategy , i.e.  a strategy that results in a win , no matter what strategy the other player uses . if the graph is finite , it is easy to check that the game is a win for exactly one player . in an infinite graph , it is possible that neither player has a winning strategy , in which case we say that the game is a * draw * ( with the interpretation that the game continues forever with optimal play ) .",
    "as we shall see , the outcome of trap is intimately tied to the properties of maximum - cardinality matchings , and draws relate to sensitivity of such matchings to boundary conditions . in @xcite , results about minimum weight matchings in edge - weighted graphs were derived from analysis of a related game called _",
    "exploration_. we shall consider another related game , which we call * vicious trap * , in which a player , after making a move , is allowed to destroy ( i.e. , delete from the graph ) any subset of the vertices that he could have just moved to .",
    "these games are also related to the game of slither and its variants , as studied in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in playing trap on a percolation cluster .",
    "let @xmath3 be an infinite connected graph , let @xmath4 $ ] , and let each vertex of @xmath3 be declared * closed * with probability @xmath5 , and otherwise * open * , independently for different vertices .",
    "consider trap on the subgraph of @xmath3 induced by the set of open vertices .",
    "( equivalently , we play on @xmath3 but with moves to closed vertices forbidden . for convenience ,",
    "the game is declared a first player win if the initial vertex is closed . )",
    "we emphasize that the random subgraph is assumed known to both players when deciding on their strategies .",
    "if @xmath5 exceeds one minus the critical probability for site percolation on @xmath3 , then almost surely the subgraph has no infinite components , and therefore the game can not be a draw . for many graphs ( including the hypercubic lattice @xmath6 ) , the latter conclusion can be extended to a strictly longer interval of @xmath5 using the method of essential enhancements @xcite .",
    "on @xmath6 itself ( i.e.  on the open subgraph with @xmath7 ) , trap is easily seen to be a draw .",
    "the regime of small positive @xmath5 seems to be the most interesting .",
    "a fascinating open question is whether there exists @xmath8 for which trap on the open subgraph of @xmath6 ( started from the origin ) is a draw with positive probability .",
    "as we discuss later , simulations lend some support to a negative answer in dimension @xmath9 . on the other hand , draws _ do _ occur on certain random trees @xcite , while variants of the model on _ directed _ lattices exhibit draws in dimensions @xmath2 but not in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "suppose now that the graph @xmath3 is bipartite , and call vertices in its two classes * odd * and * even*. a natural extension of the above model is to declare odd and even vertices closed with respective probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath10 ( with different vertices still receiving independent assignments ) . given an initial vertex ( which may be odd or even ) , one player always moves from even vertices to odd vertices .",
    "call this player * odin * , and the other player * eve*. we summarize these conventions in [ odd - even ] . the probability that odin wins is non - increasing in @xmath5 and non - decreasing in @xmath10 , and vice - versa for eve .",
    "( indeed , introducing more closed odd vertices preserves all winning strategies for eve but can not create winning strategies for odin . )",
    "however , there is apparently no obvious monotonicity argument for the probability of a draw .",
    "if @xmath11 then we should expect eve to have an advantage .",
    "our first main result states that this advantage is decisive in the extreme case @xmath12 .",
    "we prove this in all dimensions @xmath1 , but on a slightly non - standard lattice when @xmath2 .",
    "the * body - centered hypercubic lattice * is the graph @xmath13 whose vertices are all elements of @xmath6 having coordinates that are all even or all odd ( called even and odd vertices respectively ) , and with an edge between vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 whenever @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is isomorphic to the usual square lattice @xmath0 .",
    "[ bcc ] let @xmath18 and consider the body - centered lattice @xmath13 , with odd and even vertices closed with respective probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath10 . consider a game of trap between eve and odin on the open subgraph of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "almost surely , for every initial vertex , eve wins .    for all @xmath8 there exists @xmath19 such that if @xmath20 then almost surely , for every initial vertex , the game is not a draw .    the key step in our proof of [ bcc",
    "] will be to show the existence of finite regions with the property that if odin enters one , he can not escape .",
    "this is proved using a result of @xcite on ( modified ) bootstrap percolation . to ensure that with high probability a region has the required properties for this argument , it must be very large , of order @xmath21 for small @xmath5 ( where @xmath22 , and the exponential function is iterated @xmath23 times ) .",
    "this follows from results of @xcite .",
    "the resulting lower bound on @xmath24 is therefore very small : @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "it is likely that our methods could be adapted to prove that the conclusions of [ bcc ] hold also for the standard hypercubic lattice @xmath6 in all dimensions . checking this entails adapting standard results of @xcite to a variant of bootstrap percolation in a different combinatorial setting . rather than pursuing this ,",
    "we focus next on the more interesting question of obtaining tighter bounds involving finite regions in dimension @xmath27 .",
    "this will yield improved bounds on @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , understanding the game on finite regions is an important step towards the main open question about the case @xmath29 as discussed earlier .    [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^ \" , ]      [ t : matchgame ] gives rise to a practical algorithm for determining the outcome of trap on a finite bipartite graph .",
    "we can find a maximum size matching @xmath30 using the hopcroft - karp algorithm @xcite .",
    "then we can search for all matched vertices @xmath15 from which there is no alternating path leading to an unmatched vertex .",
    "a vertex @xmath15 has this property precisely if it is contained in every maximum matching , i.e.  if it is a winning initial vertex for the first player .    to gain insight about trap in the most interesting setting of @xmath0 with @xmath29",
    ", we may proceed as follows .",
    "consider the square @xmath31 ^ 2\\cap{\\mathbb{z}}^2 $ ] , with odd and even vertices closed with equal probability @xmath29 , and declare the game a draw if the token ever leaves the square .",
    "we may determine the outcome of this game by applying the method described above to the square with two different boundary conditions , and comparing the results .",
    "in one case we modify the graph just outside the boundary of the square so that all internal boundary vertices of the resulting graph are even ; this means that eve wins if the token leaves the square . in the other",
    "case we similarly arrange that odin wins if the token leaves the square .",
    "an initial vertex should then be considered a draw if its outcomes differ between these two boundary conditions .",
    "thus we can identify the outcome from every initial vertex .",
    "[ f : simulation50,f : simulation400 ] show the results of the above experiment on squares of sizes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with four different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the results are suggestive of the following picture . for each @xmath5 , there are domains within which one or other player can force a win , presumably owing to a local preponderance of closed vertices of the appropriate parity .",
    "these domains tend to abut each other , so that there are no regions of draws between them .",
    "( an additional complication is the appearance of `` checkerboard '' regions , from which the first player wins , near some interfaces between opposing domains ) .",
    "the typical size of a domain apparently diverges as @xmath5 becomes small , and , if the square is not large enough to contain a whole domain , then instead draws are prevalent",
    ".    however , the simulations seem consistent with the hypothesis that the typical domain size is finite for each @xmath8 , and only approaches @xmath34 as @xmath26 .",
    "this would suggest that there are no draws on @xmath0 for any @xmath8 .",
    "( other interpretations of the data are possible , and our confidence in this conclusion is not especially high ) .",
    "on the other hand , on @xmath6 with @xmath2 , by analogy with the directed variants of trap considered in @xcite , one may speculate that draws _ do _ occur when @xmath5 and @xmath10 are equal and sufficiently small .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : bcc ] we prove [ bcc ] using a bootstrap percolation argument .",
    "next , in   [ s : finite ] , we prove [ t : matchgame , t : indgame ] . in   [ s : ub ] and   [ s : lb ] respectively we use these results to prove theorems [ upper ] and [ lower ] on the diamond . in   [ s : game ] , we give some consequences for regions of other shapes , and for the length of the game on @xmath0 .",
    "our proof of [ bcc ] exploits a connection with a variant of bootstrap percolation .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 be an open even vertex of the body - centered lattice @xmath13 , and suppose that of the @xmath35 adjacent odd vertices , exactly one , @xmath15 , is open .",
    "starting from @xmath15 , eve can win immediately by moving to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 is effectively forbidden to odin , and so we can now iterate the argument with @xmath15 added to the set of closed odd vertices .    here is the relevant bootstrap percolation model on @xmath6 , which we call the * frbose model * because it is a natural extension to @xmath1 dimensions of a model introduced in @xcite .",
    "we start with a given subset @xmath36 of @xmath6 , whose elements are said to be * occupied * at time @xmath37 .",
    "we define the set of occupied vertices at time @xmath38 , denoted @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , inductively as follows .",
    "any vertex occupied at time @xmath41 remains occupied at time @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , if all but one of the elements of any hypercube of the form @xmath42 are occupied at time @xmath41 , then the one remaining vertex of the hypercube becomes occupied at time @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the set of eventually occupied vertices .",
    "given an initially occupied set @xmath44 , a set @xmath45 is said to be * internally spanned * if @xmath46 , i.e.  if @xmath47 becomes fully occupied when we start from only the initially occupied vertices in @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48^d\\cap{\\mathbb{z}}^d$ ] .",
    "the following is a standard result of bootstrap percolation , adapted to the frbose model .",
    "[ p : frobose ] fix @xmath5 and let each vertex of @xmath6 be initially occupied independently with probability @xmath5 . for all @xmath49 and @xmath8 we have @xmath50    proposition [ p : frobose ] follows from arguments of @xcite .",
    "another version of the argument , giving much tighter bounds , appears in @xcite .",
    "the relevant results in @xcite state that the conclusion of [ p : frobose ] holds for another model called _ modified _ bootstrap percolation ( in which a vertex becomes occupied if it has at least one occupied neighbor in each dimension ) .",
    "the frbose model is ` weaker ' in the sense that it is harder for a vertex to become occupied , so the conclusion itself does not carry over directly .",
    "however , the proofs in @xcite proceed by defining particular events @xmath51 such that @xmath52 as @xmath53 , and such that @xmath54 is internally spanned ( with respect to the modified model ) on the event @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out ( and it is straightforward to verify ) that @xmath54 is also internally spanned with respect to the frbose model on the same event @xmath51 , so [ p : frobose ] immediately follows .    to connect the frbose bootstrap model with trap on @xmath13 ,",
    "let @xmath56 ( respectively , @xmath57 ) be the graph comprising all odd ( even ) vertices of @xmath13 , with an edge between any pair of vertices that are at @xmath58 distance @xmath27 .",
    "obviously @xmath56 is isomorphic to the standard hypercubic lattice @xmath6 .",
    "let vertices of @xmath13 be open or closed , as usual .",
    "then we may run the frbose bootstrap percolation model on @xmath56 ( by which we mean that we consider the image under the obvious isomorphism of the model on @xmath6 ) .",
    "we declare the closed odd vertices initially occupied .",
    "recall that @xmath48^d\\cap{\\mathbb{z}}^d$ ] . for an odd vertex @xmath59 ,",
    "define the set of odd vertices @xmath60 .",
    "note that the induced subgraph of @xmath61 in the graph @xmath56 is isomorphic to the induced subgraph of @xmath54 in @xmath6 .",
    "also let @xmath62 be the set of all even vertices all of whose neighbors lie in @xmath63 , and let @xmath64 .",
    "we call the box @xmath65 * good * if ( i ) all of its even vertices are open , and ( ii ) its odd subgraph @xmath63 is internally spanned with respect to the frbose bootstrap model on @xmath66 started with the closed vertices occupied .",
    "[ p : bccbox ] suppose that the box @xmath65 is good .",
    "then from every odd @xmath67 , eve has a winning strategy for trap that guarantees that the token never leaves @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the set of closed odd vertices in @xmath63 , and let @xmath68 be the set of vertices that are occupied at time @xmath38 starting from @xmath36 occupied .",
    "for @xmath69 , let @xmath70 be the time at which @xmath15 becomes occupied , i.e.  let @xmath71 if @xmath72 .    for the purpose of this proof",
    "it is convenient to allow odin to move to a closed vertex , but declare an immediate win for eve if he does so .",
    "( this clearly does not change the outcome of the game ) .",
    "we claim that starting from any @xmath69 , eve has a winning strategy that guarantees that @xmath73 is strictly decreasing along the sequence of odd vertices that are visited . here",
    "is eve s strategy , which we define inductively .",
    "suppose ( perhaps after some steps of the game played according to such a strategy ) that it is eve s turn .",
    "then the token is at an odd vertex @xmath15 ; suppose @xmath74 .",
    "by definition of the frbose model , there exists an even neighbor @xmath75 of @xmath15 , all of whose neighbors other than @xmath15 lie in @xmath76 . since @xmath15 is the first vertex in @xmath39 that has been visited , no other neighbor of @xmath75 has been visited before , therefore @xmath75 has not been visited .",
    "therefore , eve moves to @xmath75 , and odin must then move to an element of @xmath76 , as required .",
    "in particular , we deduce that starting from a vertex in @xmath39 , eve has a winning strategy that guarantees that the token remains in @xmath65 and that eve makes at most @xmath38 moves .",
    "standard results also show that @xmath6 itself is internally spanned almost surely in the frbose model for any positive density @xmath5 of initially occupied sites .",
    "hence , a minor variant of the above argument already shows that with @xmath8 and @xmath12 , eve wins on @xmath13 if she has the first move . to deal with small positive @xmath10 and the possibility that odin starts",
    ", we need to be a little more careful .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "by translation invariance , it suffices to prove the claims for trap started at @xmath37 or @xmath79 . for an integer @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "we introduce the renormalized box @xmath82 .",
    "note that these boxes are disjoint for different @xmath83 , but adjacent boxes almost abut each other : if @xmath84 then there is a layer of even vertices between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , but all neighbors of those vertices lie in one of the two boxes .",
    "we first prove part ( ii ) .",
    "let @xmath87 be the critical probability of site percolation on the @xmath1-dimensional * star - lattice * , i.e.  the graph with vertex set @xmath6 and an edge between @xmath14 and @xmath15 whenever @xmath88 .",
    "fix @xmath8 . by [ p : bccbox ]",
    ", there exists @xmath80 such that with @xmath12 , we have @xmath89 .",
    "since the box has finitely many even vertices , the same conclusion holds for @xmath10 sufficiently small ; fix such a @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath90 .",
    "note that we include the origin regardless of whether or not @xmath91 is good .",
    "the set @xmath92 induces a subgraph of the star - lattice ; let @xmath93 be the vertex set of the component containing @xmath37 . then @xmath93 is finite almost surely .",
    "let @xmath94 be union of the renormalized boxes @xmath95 for @xmath96 , together with the set of all even vertices of @xmath13 adjacent to them .",
    "then @xmath94 is a.s .",
    "finite and contains @xmath91 ( which contains @xmath37 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "furthermore , every infinite path in @xmath13 starting from a vertex in @xmath94 intersects some good box that is not @xmath91 .",
    "see [ f : contour ] .",
    "suppose that the token starts from @xmath37 or @xmath79 and at some point leaves @xmath94 .",
    "then it must do so by entering a good box , and it must enter it at an odd vertex , via a move of odin . [",
    "p : bccbox ] implies that eve can then win within that box .",
    "it follows that the outcome of trap starting from @xmath37 or @xmath79 is identical to the outcome restricted to @xmath94 ( i.e.  with moves out of @xmath94 forbidden , and the same vertices closed as before ) .",
    "since @xmath94 is finite , the game can not be a draw , thus establishing ( ii ) .",
    "now we prove ( i ) . for all @xmath8 ,",
    "the conclusion of ( ii ) applies when @xmath12 , so the game is not a draw . however , eve has a simple strategy that guarantees she can not lose : she always moves in direction @xmath97 ( the relevant vertex can not be closed , and can not have been previously visited ) .",
    "therefore odin can not have a winning strategy , so eve wins .    as mentioned in the introduction , the method of this section",
    "could likely be extended to obtain the conclusions of [ bcc ] for trap on the euclidean lattice @xmath6 for all @xmath1 .",
    "the main required step is to show the analogue of [ p : frobose ] for the following variant bootstrap model defined on the odd vertices of @xmath6 ( i.e.  vertices whose coordinates have odd sum ) : if all but one of the @xmath98 odd neighbors of any even vertex are occupied , then the final odd neighbor becomes occupied at the next step .",
    "we emphasize that the bootstrap argument of this section is not tight .",
    "for example , in the bottom - right picture of [ f : gameplay ] , eve wins although the initial vertex does not become occupied in the bootstrap model . to get better bounds",
    ", we turn our attention to matchings .",
    "in this section we prove [ t : matchgame , t : indgame ] . throughout this section",
    "@xmath99 will be a finite , connected , simple , undirected graph .",
    "for @xmath100 , let @xmath101 denote the subgraph of @xmath3 induced by @xmath102 .",

    "if the first move is from @xmath15 to @xmath75 then the remainder of the game is clearly equivalent to trap on @xmath103 with initial vertex @xmath75",
    ". we will prove the claimed result by induction on the number of vertices of @xmath3 . in the base case @xmath104 ,",
