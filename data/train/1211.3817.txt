    "galaxy clusters and the intracluster medium ( icm ) have long since been a topic of cosmological interest .",
    "their global properties such as gas temperature , x - ray luminosity and sz - flux , enable one to draw cosmological conclusions from surveys of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , these properties have been useful mostly because they can be predicted from models of structure formation . on the contrary ,",
    "the detailed properties of the intracluster medium and their evolution with redshift are yet to be satisfactorily understood , since these properties are described by baryonic physics in addition to the dark matter potential in which it resides ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several physical processes , such as feedback from galaxies , including active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and/or radiative cooling of the icm gas , are believed to affect its x - ray properties .           +   + sph & a & b + cc & @xmath11 & @xmath12 + ncc & @xmath13 & @xmath14 + cc + ncc & @xmath15 & @xmath16 +   +   + amr & a & b + cc & @xmath17 & @xmath18 + ncc & @xmath19 & @xmath20 + cc + ncc & @xmath21 & @xmath22 +      +   + sph & a & b + cc & @xmath23 & @xmath24 + ncc & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + cc + ncc & @xmath27 & @xmath28 +   +   + amr & a & b + cc & @xmath29 & @xmath30 + ncc & @xmath31 0.022 & @xmath32 + cc + ncc & @xmath33 & @xmath34 +      +   + sph , @xmath35 & a & b + cc & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + ncc @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + ncc @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 +   +   + amr , @xmath35 & a & b + cc & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + ncc @xmath38 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + ncc @xmath41 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 +          +   + sph & a & b + cc & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + ncc & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + cc + ncc & @xmath68 0.016 & @xmath69 + cc @xmath38 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + ncc @xmath38 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + cc + ncc @xmath38 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 +   +   + amr & a & b + cc & @xmath76 & @xmath77 + ncc & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + cc + ncc & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + cc @xmath38 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 + ncc @xmath38 & @xmath84 & @xmath85 + cc + ncc @xmath38 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 +        +   + & a & b + cc & @xmath96 & @xmath97 + ncc & @xmath98 & @xmath99 + cc + ncc & @xmath100 & @xmath101",

    "<S> the amount and distribution of non - gravitational energy feedback influences the global properties of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) and is of crucial importance in modeling / simulating clusters to be used as cosmological probes . </S>",
    "<S> agns are , arguably , of primary importance in injecting energy in the cluster cores . </S>",
    "<S> we make the first estimate of non - gravitational energy _ profiles _ in galaxy cluster cores ( and beyond ) from observational data . comparing the observed entropy profiles within @xmath0 , from the representative _ xmm - newton _ cluster structure survey ( rexcess ) , to simulated base entropy profiles without feedback from both amr and sph non - radiative simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the amount of additional non - gravitational energy , @xmath1 , contained in the icm . adding the radiative losses we estimate the total energy feedback , @xmath2 , from the agn s ( the central agn in most cases ) into the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles for the energy deposition , @xmath3 , in the inner regions differ for cool - core ( cc ) and non cool - core ( ncc ) clusters ; however the differences in the profiles are much less after accounting for the radiation loss in cc clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that although the central agns pumps in energy , correlated with the halo mass , the amount of non - gravitational energy remaining in the icm depends strongly on the amount of cooling in the central region . </S>",
    "<S> the total feedback energy scales with the mean spectroscopic temperature as @xmath4 , for the entire sample , when compared with sph simulations derived base entropy profile and @xmath5 when compared with amr simulations derived base entropy profile . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter in the two cases is 15% and 23% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the mean non - gravitational energy per particle within @xmath0 , remaining in the icm after energy lost in cooling , is @xmath6 kev for the sph theoretical relation and @xmath7 kev for the amr theoretical relation .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the _ nrao / vla sky survey _ ( nvss ) source catalog to determine the radio luminosity , @xmath8 , at 1.4 ghz of the central source(s ) of our sample . for @xmath9 kev , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 correlates with @xmath8 , although with different normalization for cc and ncc clusters . </S>",
    "<S> also , cc clusters show a greater radio luminosity for a given value of feedback energy than ncc clusters . for the @xmath10 kev clusters , @xmath2 anti - correlates with @xmath8 . compared to higher temperature clusters , @xmath2 for these lower temperature clusters </S>",
    "<S> are also significantly lower ( for the similar value of @xmath8 ) implying a lower efficiency of feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we show that agns could provide a significant component of the feedback .    </S>",
    "<S> we , further , study the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and estimate the heating provided by them , and find a mild correlation between the bcg heating rate and the feedback energy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that mean mass deposition rate , inside the cooling radius , mildly correlates with the feedback energy .    </S>"
