    "the question on whether there exits a consistent covariant theory for massive gravity , where the graviton acquires a mass and leads to a modification of general relativity , was initiated by fierz and pauli ( fp ) @xcite .",
    "it was observed that at quadratic order the fp mass term is the only ghost - free term describing a gravity theory with five degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , it is not possible to recover linearized einstein gravity in the limit of vanishing graviton mass , due to the existence of the van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity arising from the coupling between the longitude mode of the graviton and the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "it was later observed that this troublesome mode could be suppressed at macroscopic length scales due to a nonlinear effect : the so - called vainshtein mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , these nonlinear terms , which are responsible for the suppression of vdvz discontinuity , lead inevitably to the existence of the boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost @xcite , making the theory unstable @xcite .",
    "although for many years it was believed that the theory of massive gravity always contains bd ghosts , a family of its nonlinear extension was recently constructed by de rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) @xcite .",
    "this is a two parameter family of nonlinear generalization of the fp theory , where the bd ghosts are removed in the decoupling limit to all orders in perturbation theory through a systematic construction of a covariant nonlinear action @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . as a consequence , the theoretical and phenomenological advantages of the drgt theory led to a wide investigation in the literature .",
    "for example , cosmological implications of the drgt theory are discussed in @xcite ; black holes and spherically symmetric solutions were analyzed in @xcite ; and the theory s connections to bi - metric gravity models were studied in @xcite .    among these phenomenological studies , is the search for observationally suitable spherically symmetry solutions .",
    "theories of massive gravity can be strongly constrained due to the vdvz discontinuity appearing in the post - newtonian parameters .",
    "recently , a class of black hole solutions in the theory of `` ghost - free '' massive gravity was analyzed by koyama , niz and tasinato ( knt ) @xcite .",
    "their result shows that the behavior of linearized solutions in general relativity can only be reproduced below the vainshtein distance in a certain region of parameter space .",
    "an exact schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) solution was found for a group of specially selected parameters @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a family of static , electrically charged black hole solutions in the theory of ghost - free massive gravity .",
    "the solutions posses a vainshtein radius , below which the linearized solutions of einstein gravity are approximately recovered in the weak charge limit . in massive gravity",
    "the longitudinal mode of gravitons is strongly coupled to the trace of energy momentum tensor and the existence of an electric charge can strongly affect the behavior of this mode .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we review the model of nonlinear massive gravity and present the equations of motion for gravitational fields in a spherically symmetric background . in section [ sphericalsol ]",
    "we investigate in detail a stellar background with a static electric field . in section [ vainshteinmech ]",
    "we analyze the charged black hole solutions both analytically and numerically , and we show that the vainshtein effect can be made manifest in a certain parameter space in the weak field limit . finally , section [ conclusions ] summarizes our results .",
    "massive gravity has an effective field theory description given by einstein gravity plus the covariant fp mass term . for the drgt model",

    "the post - newtonian parameters are strongly constrained by solar system observations ( see @xcite for a detailed introduction and a comprehensive review ) , and therefore may be used to place strong constraints on a given theory .",
    "the first post - newtonian parameter @xmath79 is defined as the ratio of @xmath70 and @xmath63 : @xmath80 in the weak field limit . in the case of general relativity @xmath81 , as we can immediately read from the rn solution .",
    "however , in the regime of length scales much smaller than the compton wavelength ( @xmath82 ) in nonlinear massive gravity , this parameter can be approximately expressed as @xmath83 where we have made the reasonable assumption that the solar - system mass @xmath48 is much larger than graviton mass .",
    "it is straightforward to see that when the solar system does not carry an electric charge ( @xmath58 ) , we obtain @xmath84 , and thus in the massless limit it reduces to @xmath85 , which is in stark disagreement with the value in general relativity . this behavior exactly manifests the vdvz discontinuity , and thus we face the difficulty of explaining solar - system observations at present .",
    "however , when the contribution of @xmath38 is taken into account , the post - newtonian parameter could approach to @xmath86 when @xmath68 is much smaller than the length scale @xmath87 this result implies that the vdvz discontinuity exists in a charged solar system governed by nonlinear massive gravity , but the explicit behavior is different from a electro - neutral one .    finally , from the solutions , and we find that the weak - field limit is a good approximation at large distances .",
    "however , when the radial coordinate @xmath68 decreases below a critical value @xmath88 the absolute value of the factor @xmath65 will increase exponentially and become much larger than unity .",
    "this critical radius is the so - called vainshtein radius .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis on the perturbation equations by keeping all nonlinear order terms of @xmath65 in the next section .",
    "due to the famous vainshtein mechanism @xcite the scalar degree of freedom in massive gravity becomes strongly coupled in the limit of small graviton mass , and thus the linearized treatment performed in equations , and is no longer reliable .",
    "this is observed by following the evolution of metric factor @xmath65 below the vainshtein radius , where the absolute value of @xmath65 becomes much greater than unity .",
    "consequently , although we can keep treating @xmath63 and @xmath70 as small perturbations in this regime , higher order terms in @xmath65 should be taken into account .      keeping leading order in @xmath63 and @xmath70 , the perturbed equations of motion including nonlinear corrections of @xmath65",

    "the post - newtonian parameter takes the value of @xmath100 in the regime of length scales of interest .",
    "although this parameter increases to @xmath86 at very small values of radial coordinate due to the effect of electric charge , the corresponding length scale is deeply inside the horizon of the black hole . as a consequence",
    ", the standard general relativity result can not be recovered in the solar system governed by massive gravity with such a parameter choice , and therefore this case is already observationally ruled out .",
    "we now proceed to the case with a vanishing @xmath5 but non - vanishing @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", one can solve the @xmath65-equation exactly , however the resulting expression is quite complicated , hiding the underlying physics .",
    "therefore , instead of finding an exact solution to @xmath65 we solve the perturbed bianchi equation approximately by keeping dominant terms in @xmath65 .",
    "different from the electro - neutral case of @xcite , both the solar - system mass @xmath48 and its electric charge @xmath38 contribute to the l.h.s of equation .",
    "therefore , we need to solve by assuming its l.h.s is dominated by @xmath48 and @xmath38 respectively .",

    "moreover , the suppression scale is @xmath109 rather than the vainshtein radius @xmath110 . however , since for a group of canonical parameters accommodating with astronomical data @xmath110 is usually much bigger than @xmath109 , we deduce that the contribution of the third term in the r.h.s . of equation is considerable in a wide regime of length scales . then , from equations and we can derive the expressions for @xmath63 and @xmath70 through a taylor expansion @xmath111 up to order @xmath103 . by observing and , when @xmath112 , the corrections of massive gravity to the general relativity results are quite small .",

    "[ fig : case3_h large ] , where the three curves almost coincide .    as shown in this figure @xmath140 in the range @xmath141 .",
    "thus , in the semi - analytical calculation , we keep the leading order terms of the equations of motion for the metric factors , and then we acquire @xmath142 from the above semi - analytic results we find that the corrections to @xmath70 and @xmath63 are so dramatic that the usual schwarzschild - like gravitational potential ( in form of @xmath143 ) is exactly canceled .",
    "this result agrees with the conclusion of @xcite in which a neutral solar system was considered .    finally , for the gravitational potential associated with the electric charge ,",
    "the rn - like factor @xmath144 in @xmath33 also disappears , but the dominant term in the small radius regime roughly takes the form of @xmath145 . for the @xmath146 component the sign in front of @xmath144 changes from positive to negative compared to the general relativity result .",
    "these new features suggest that the charged solar system described by nonlinear massive gravity is much more smooth near the origin than that described by general relativity . however , since below the vainshtein radius the difference from general relativity is quite significant in this case , the corresponding parameter space is likely ruled out by local , solar system experiments .",
    "we now consider the subcase @xmath7 .",
    "apart from the previous solution in which @xmath65 is large - valued below the vainshtein radius , there exists a second solution in which the metric factor @xmath65 always takes a small value outside the schwarzschild radius .",
    "similarly to the previous subcase we solve the equations of motion numerically , obtaining the solution for the metric factor @xmath65 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_h small ] .",
    "in addition , we extract the evolutions of @xmath70 and @xmath133 along the radial coordinate @xmath68 . in order to provide a clearer picture of the difference of the dynamics in massive gravity from that of general relativity , in fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_gr ] we plot the ratios @xmath148 and @xmath132 , respectively .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_h small ] we can see that in a strongly charged solar system the absolute value @xmath127 can become larger than @xmath86 inside the schwarzschild radius . as we move away from the schwarzschild radius @xmath65 evolves to a constant , which coincides with the value when the charge is weak .",
    "after crossing the vainshtein radius @xmath65 approaches @xmath149 rapidly . by comparing @xmath70 and @xmath133 with the results of general relativity",
    ", we can clearly see the vainshtein mechanism from fig [ fig : case3_gr ] .",
    "since @xmath127 is always smaller than unity outside the schwarzschild radius , we can solve its equation of motion by neglecting the terms proportional to @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "correspondingly , the approximate solution is given by @xmath152^{1/2}\\right\\ } ~,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which proves to be in good agreement with the numerical solution .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath153 and @xmath133 are obtained from equations and , however they are quite complicated and thus we do not present them explicitly .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that in this case the dynamical features of the metric factors @xmath70 and @xmath63 are quite similar to the case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_gr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : case2_nf ] .",
    "this implies that the solution obtained in the @xmath3 case might be dynamically stable in the parameter space of the nonlinear massive gravity model .      in last subsection",
    "we examine a family of solutions in the model of nonlinear massive gravity under the particular parameter choice @xmath8 .",
    "this special parameter choice was first noticed in @xcite , where the exact sds and rn - ds solutions were obtained with an arbitrary cosmological constant term .",
    "this relation was also applied by the authors of @xcite , who constructed a special family of black hole solutions on a fixed ds background .",
    "we insert the relation @xmath8 into the nonlinear equation of motion and we find that there exists a special solution for @xmath65 , namely @xmath154 which implies a constant metric factor @xmath155",
    ". then we substitute the solution into the exact background equation of motion and the bianchi constraint .",
    "it is easy to verify that the constraint equation is automatically satisfied . working with the @xmath57",
    "coordinate directly we see that the main equation yields the following exact solution : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is an integration constant .",
    "we can perform the following coordinate rescaling : @xmath158 and introduce two coefficients @xmath159 which are related to the schwarzschild radius and the de sitter radius , respectively .",
    "we get the exact form of the rn - ds - like solution as @xmath160 with @xmath161 where the forms of @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 are provided in and , respectively .",
    "the above solution can recover the standard rn result in general relativity , and @xmath163 coincides to the usual schwarzschild radius @xmath165 when we take @xmath166 .",
    "furthermore , our result is in agreement with the one obtained in @xcite , however we did not introduce an additional cosmological constant in order to see whether and how a pure massive gravity model can yield a ds background by itself .",
    "moreover , the coefficient @xmath164 is determined by the combination of the graviton mass @xmath130 and the model parameter @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is of order @xmath139 we can apparently observe that the property of ds background is completely determined by the graviton mass .",
    "if we apply this feature in a cosmological setup , the existence of a tiny graviton mass can drive a late - time acceleration of the universe and thus might explain the present cosmological observations .",
    "however , if we tune @xmath4 to an extremely large value then the effect of the graviton mass can be decreased and the background dynamics approach those of general relativity .",
    "mathematically this effect can be seen by the way @xmath167 appearing in the graviton potential @xmath11 is roughly proportional to @xmath168 and thus it yields the amplitude of the effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath26 in form of @xmath168 .",
    "eventually , the behavior of nonlinear massive gravity approaches standard einstein gravity in the limit of @xmath169 .",
    "in the present work , we investigated the spherically symmetric solutions of a charged solar system in the context of nonlinear massive gravity . due to properties of the graviton potential in the drgt model , the bd ghost which historically plagues all massive gravity theories",
    "can be removed .",
    "however , inherited from other massive gravity models , the longitudinal mode of gravitons is strongly coupled and thus greatly affect the gravitational potential at macroscopic scales . therefore , this model is expected to be constrained by solar system observations .      *",
    "the first class corresponds to @xmath1 and thus the graviton s potential takes a fixed form .",
    "the solution in this subclass is well described at the perturbative level , but the vdvz discontinuity can not be avoided .",
    "however , the post - newtonian parameter in this class fails to agree with general relativity and thus the corresponding parameter choice is observationally ruled out .",
    "* in the second subclass , we keep @xmath3 but we allow @xmath4 to be an arbitrary constant .",
    "the corresponding solution shows that general relativity can be recovered between the outer horizon of the black hole and the vainshtein radius by virtue of the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "this scenario is similar to the case of the neutral black hole in massive gravity .",
    "however , the existence of an electric charge could increase the value of the metric factor @xmath65 within a newly defined radius @xmath109 and thus the detailed evolutions of time - like and space - like metric components behave differently from those of a neutral black hole .",
    "namely , the metric factor @xmath63 obtains a logarithmic correction when the radius is close to the outer horizon . *",
    "the third subclass of parameter choice is the most general in the parameter space , which requires both @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be non - vanishing . in this case",
    "the dynamics of solutions behave dramatically different depending on the positivity of @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 the strongly coupled scalar graviton greatly decreases the strength of gravity at small length scales , and thus the usual schwarzschild - like gravitational potential totally disappears which severely challenges all astronomical observations .",
    "however , if @xmath5 is positive general relativity can be recovered again through the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "this behavior is similar to the solution in the second subclass with @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the solution in this case , together with the solution in the second subclass , might provide a certain parameter space for nonlinear massive gravity to conform with current solar system observations .",
    "* finally , there exists a particular parameter choice in the last subclass which suggests @xmath8 . under this condition",
    "the background equations of motion can be solved exactly and yield a solution which is identical to the rn - ds form in which only the ds radius @xmath164 contains the model parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the exact solution with such a special parameter choice can recover the standard result in general relativity in the limit of either a vanishing graviton mass or an extremely large value of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "note that , the structure of solutions does not only depend on the sign of @xmath5 , but also on a diverse structure in the parameter space of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the authors of @xcite analyzed the whole parameter space of a neutral solar system under nonlinear massive gravity and found that each region showed a completely different behavior with respect to the inner solutions ( near the body ) and the asymptotic solutions , and thus affect the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "it would be interesting to perform a global analysis on the parameter space in our case too .",
    "lastly , we would like to mention that in the present work we only focus on the analysis of background solutions of a charged solar system in the drgt model , without studying the perturbations . at the background level the parameter space of model parameter",
    "has already shown rich behaviors and a sizable regime has already been ruled out by observations . due to the vainshtein mechanism there exists an island in the parameter space which is consistent with astronomical data at the background level . moreover",
    ", this situation could dramatically changed if the perturbations were taken into account and we expect the model parameters appearing in the nonlinear massive gravity would be further constrained .",
    "however , we leave such a study for future investigation .",
