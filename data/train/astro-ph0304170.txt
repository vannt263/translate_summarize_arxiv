    "each exposure consisted of 4 fp - splits and several exposures were obtained at each nominal wavelength setting , but slightly offset from each other .",
    "the most important step in the reduction involved the realization of the highest possible signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio from the data .",
    "we applied the procedures outlined by cardelli & ebbets ( 1994 ) for the minimization of noise due to granularity , etc . on each fp - split subexposure .",
    "the final spectrum for a wavelength interval was derived from merging the individual fp - splits in wavelength space .",
    "table 1 provides a listing of the exposures for each star , as well as other pertinent information , such as central wavelength and the number of counts . the total number of counts for an interval , the s / n ratio attained in the merged spectra , and the co bands covered by the interval are also shown .",
    "the exposure times were 1632@xmath15 , except for z2b9020 g where one fp - split subexposure failed .",
    "the resultant s / n ratio in our final spectra is on average very similar to the tabulated values computed from ( total counts)@xmath33 .",
    "two - ngstrm segments centered on each co band were extracted and the stellar continuum was rectified with routines available in the iraf environment distributed by noao . the rectification process still retained residuals that constitute the largest errors in the profiles of the strong bands ( @xmath34 @xmath10 25 ) . while uncertainties in equivalent width ( @xmath35 ) as large as 25% are possible , the self - consistent column densities for the suite of bands suggests smaller systematic errors . a further problem arose while rectifying the spectra of @xmath3 oph .",
    "since @xmath3 oph is a be star , its continuum varies much more than do those of @xmath2 oph a and @xmath11 oph .",
    "this introduced the largest source of error in the band profiles for the star because the acceptable rectified continuum depends to some extent on the person performing the task .",
    "our final continua reflect the consensus of at least two rectifiers ( y.s . and s.r.f . ) .",

    "for @xmath2 oph a , fitting of the continuum level around the ch@xmath20 lines was straightforward . however , for @xmath3 oph , an underlying stellar emission line caused some concern .",

    "an unfortunate fact of our spectrum was that only part of the stellar line was included , and so we performed a normal continuum division , restricted to a limited wavelength interval in order to minimize the influence of baseline structure .",
    "since for @xmath3 oph the interstellar line is located on the blue wing of the stellar line , rather than in the self - reversal core ( cf .",

    "first , other analyses that yielded smaller relative amounts of @xmath0co from the co data toward @xmath11 oph were based either on a set of @xmath26-values now known to be inaccurate ( lyu et al . 1994 ) or on data of the same bands for @xmath0co and @xmath1co ( levshakov & kegel 1994 ) which are prone to optical depth corrections in the more abundant isotopomer .",
    "the former point is addressed in more detail below .",
    "second , our synthesis code does not always give results indicating enhanced amounts of @xmath0co . in a paper on photodissociation regions toward sources of reflection nebulae ( knauth et al .",
    "2001 ) , our code used for profile synthesis confirmed the lower @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio ( @xmath21 40 ) seen toward 20 aql ( hanson , snow , & black 1992 ) from an independent extraction of @xmath125 spectra .",
    "an especially critical one is the third reason .",
    "new measurements of @xmath26-values for rydberg transitions of co are larger than once thought ( federman et al .",
    "[ these are the @xmath26-values giving excellent fits to the co bands seen in @xmath64 spectra , upon adoption of the parameters derived from the @xmath27 bands , as discussed in section 3 and in federman & lambert ( 2002 ) . ]",
    "although only a few transitions of importance in co photodissociation have been re - examined to date , in all cases the @xmath26-values for rydberg transitions are about a factor of two larger than those compiled by eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1991 ) from the measurements of letzelter et al .",
    "this may explain why ab initio modeling efforts , such as those of van dishoeck & black ( 1986 ) , van dishoeck & black ( 1988 ) , kopp et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and warin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , are unable to produce @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratios much in excess of the ambient @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio .",
    "use of a larger @xmath26-value would increase the optical depth of dissociating transitions , which in turn leads to more self shielding for the more abundant isotopomer .",
    "moreover , larger optical depths in lines leading to co dissociation would improve the correspondence between model predictions and submillimeter - wave observations of dense photodissociation regions ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "further work is needed to derive accurate @xmath26-values for all transitions involved in co photodissociation .",
    "more self shielding for @xmath0co would also provide a better correspondence in the co abundance between model and observations .",
    "for instance , the theoretical predictions of van dishoeck & black ( 1986 ) are too small by factors of a few , even after accounting for the smaller values for @xmath106 derived from vibrationally excited h@xmath8 .",
    "an enhancement in co production would help alleviate the problem as well .",
    "a key reaction is c@xmath20  @xmath24",
    "oh  @xmath126  co@xmath20  @xmath24  h. dubernet , gargaud , & mccarroll ( 1992 ) performed quantal calculations on this reaction and obtained a rate constant of about @xmath127 @xmath128 s@xmath47 , which is substantially larger than the estimate given in prasad & huntress ( 1980 ) and is about a factor of 2 larger than the value given by federman & huntress ( 1989 ) based on average dipole orientation ( ado ) theory .    while a self - consistent picture seems to be emerging ,",
    "we briefly discuss the apparent contradictory results of lyu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and liszt & lucas ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is our contention that the differences between lyu et al . and our earlier work ( sheffer et al . 1992 ; lambert et al .",
    "1994 ) for @xmath11 oph lie in the adopted @xmath26-values . as noted in the introduction , lambert et al . found a more satisfactory curve of growth with the @xmath26-values of chan et al .",
    "all agree that the column density of @xmath0co is best determined by the 11@xmath160 and 12@xmath160 bands , which are essentially optically thin . for these bands , the @xmath26-values of eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1992 ) are 50% larger than those of chan et al . with their preferred curve of growth ,",
    "lyu et al .",
    "infer @xmath4(@xmath0co ) @xmath10 @xmath129 @xmath31 ; this value becomes @xmath130 @xmath31 when using chan et al.s @xmath26-values , much more in line with the results of lambert et al .",
    "( @xmath111 @xmath31 ) .",
    "we also point out that the two sets of results for the 5@xmath160 band of @xmath1co agree nicely .",
    "there is another way to check the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratios : the ratio of @xmath26-values for @xmath1co and @xmath0co bands with the same @xmath35 .",
    "lambert et al . provided a comparison in their table 5 , which indicates a ratio greater than 125 .",
    "the same comparison can be made with our data displayed in table 2 . for both @xmath2",
    "oph a and @xmath3 oph , the @xmath35 for the 11@xmath160 band of @xmath0co is the same as that for the 4@xmath160 band of @xmath1co .",
    "the ratio of @xmath26-values is 134 , consistent with our isotopomeric ratios .",
    "finally , we comment on the work of liszt & lucas ( 1998 ) , where the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio decreases with increasing @xmath4(@xmath0co ) for column densities sampled by our uv measurements .",
    "first , our results specifically concern the clouds in sco - oph ; other clouds , like that toward 20 aql , have much smaller ratios ( hanson et al .",
    "1992 ; knauth et al .",
    "second , there are no direct measures of extinction or c@xmath20 abundance for their extragalactic sight lines .",
    "enhancements in @xmath1co relative to @xmath0co require a significant flux of uv radiation to produce the c@xmath20 needed for isotopic charge exchange ( but not too large to heat the gas via photoelectrons coming off grains ) .",
    "a more accurate determination of the extinction would also help clarify why complex molecules such as hcn ( e.g. , lucas & liszt 1994 ) are detected , when standard chemical models of diffuse molecular gas ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1986 ) suggest very low abundances .",
    "in summary , ultraviolet observations of co and its isotopic variants toward @xmath2 oph a and @xmath3 oph were analyzed in conjunction with measurements on absorption from c  i and vibrationally excited h@xmath8 .",
    "significant enhancements in the amount of @xmath0co relative to the other isotopomers were found .",
    "the amount of h@xmath8 in @xmath101 @xmath10 3 toward @xmath2 oph a indicates an ultraviolet flux about 10 times the average interstellar flux permeates this direction ; for the @xmath3 oph sight line , the flux can not be greater than twice the average interstellar value .",
    "analysis of c  i ( and c@xmath8 ) excitation reveals modest densities for the material seen in absorption .",
    "resonant scattering of emission lines from nearby molecular clouds controls the distribution of co rotational levels , thereby limiting the usefulness of co excitation for inferring density .",
    "simple arguments based on the processes involved in selective isotopic photodissociation are able to reproduce the observed @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratios .",
    "incorporation of an improved set of @xmath26-values for dissociating transitions in large scale models will likely lead to better agreement with our observations .",
    "in addition to lines of co , h@xmath8 , c  i , s  i , co  ii , and ni  ii reported here and in zsarg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , mullman et al . (",
    "1998 ) , and zsarg & federman ( 1998 ) , our spectra of @xmath2 oph a and @xmath3 oph reveal absorption from ga  ii , as  ii , and sn  ii .",
    "the results are given in table 8 , where @xmath35 and @xmath4(x ) are listed .",
    "the sources of @xmath26-values used in deriving column densities are morton ( 1991 ) for ga  ii , cardelli et al .",
    "( 1993b ) for as  ii , and schectman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for sn  ii .",
    "a curve of growth with a @xmath46-value of 2.5 km s@xmath47 was used ; such a @xmath46-value is common for the dominant ion ( savage , cardelli , & sofia 1992 ) .",
    "two components , separated by about 10 km s@xmath47 , are discerned in the spectra of @xmath3 oph .",
    "these are the major complexes found in na  i d ( welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , knowledge of the total proton column density yields an elemental abundance .",
    "we adopted a combination of the h@xmath8 data of savage et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and h  i data of diplas & savage ( 1994 ) for @xmath2 oph a , @xmath131 @xmath10 @xmath132 @xmath31 , and the results of bohlin , savage , & drake ( 1978 ) for @xmath3 oph , @xmath133 @xmath31 .",

    "<S> absorption from vibrationally excited h@xmath8 ( @xmath9 @xmath10 3 ) was clearly seen toward this star as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratios are larger than the isotopic ratios for carbon and oxygen appropriate for ambient interstellar material . since for both carbon and oxygen the more abundant isotopomer </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced , selective isotopic photodissociation plays the key role in the fractionation process for these directions . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement arises because the more abundant isotopomer has lines that are more optically thick , resulting in more self shielding from dissociating radiation . </S>",
    "<S> a simple argument involving the amount of self shielding [ from @xmath4(@xmath0co ) ] and the strength of the ultraviolet radiation field premeating the gas ( from the amount of vibrationally excited h@xmath8 ) shows that selective isotopic photodissociation controls the fractionation seen in these two sight lines , as well as the sight line to @xmath11 oph .    </S>",
