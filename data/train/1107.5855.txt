    ", we can also deduce the following corollary , which in particular answers an earlier question of yongwu rong ( * ? ? ? * problem 3.100 ) :    [ main - d - dominate ] for any integer @xmath1 , every orientable closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath2-dominates only finitely many homeomorphically distinct @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "rong s original question asked only about @xmath9-dominations . by around 2002 , many partial results had been proved , including a complete affirmative answer to rong s question in the geometric ( target ) case , contributed from different people ( @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) . here",
    "we refer the reader to an earlier survey @xcite of shicheng wang .",
    "those studies clarified the right expectation about finiteness of targets under dominations , eventually formulated as question [ questionbrw ] .",
    "we refer the readers to the introduction of @xcite for more recent results on this topic .",
    "the main technique of proving theorem [ main - dominate ] is the presentation length estimation , as was used in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite was concerned about knot complements , so the complexity of gluings was reduced to the complexity of geometric pieces using the desatellite trick .",
    "that trick does not work in general . as we shall see in section [ sec - geompieces ] , the finiteness of gluings becomes an essential issue to address in our current context .",
    "to illustrate the idea , let us assume at this point that @xmath3 is an orientable closed @xmath0-manifold that dominates an orientable closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath4 obtained from gluing two one - cusped hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds along the toral boundaries . pulling straight @xmath10 with respect to the hyperbolic geometry on both of the pieces ,",
    "the area of @xmath11 should be at least the area in the neighborhood of the cutting torus @xmath12 , namely , the sum of its areas within the ( margulis ) cusps . when the gluing is complicated enough , there is at most one slope @xmath13 on @xmath14 which is short ( i.e. no longer than some given bound imposed by @xmath3 ) on both sides .",
    "pretend that @xmath15 could be homotoped in @xmath14 into a regular neighborhood of @xmath13 , then @xmath5 factors through the drilling @xmath16 homotopically , so it can not have nonzero degree .",
    "this provides an _ a priori _ upper bound on the complexity of gluings under the domination assumption .",
    "similar as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) , such factorization is not real in general , but it works in certain ` homological sense ' .",
    "this is satisfactory enough for our applications .",
    "when seifert fibered pieces are involved , the bound of the local complexity of gluings on each jsj torus is not enough to determine the target @xmath4 up to finitely many possibilities , so one should also count the total complexity of gluings on all the boundary components of a seifert fibered piece .",
    "however , the spirit is similar to the local case .",
    "finally , we remark that a significant shortcut in our treatment is lemma [ dominationonto ] , which uses a poincar - lefschetz duality argument as a substitution of the factorization argument .    in section [ sec - geompieces ]",
    ", we give a brief review of the background and reduce the proof of theorem [ main - dominate ] to bounding the complexity of gluings . in section [ sec - distortion ] , we introduce the notion of _ distortion _ measuring the complexity of gluings . in section [ sec - jsjgluings ] , we show that any bound on the ( primary average ) distortion yields finiteness of gluings . in section [ sec - nongeomcase ] , we prove theorem [ main - dominate ] by bounding the distortion of the targets . in section [ sec - boundeddegree ] , we prove corollary [ main - d - dominate ] by generalizing previously known arguments for geometric target cases . in section [ sec - conclusion ] ,",
