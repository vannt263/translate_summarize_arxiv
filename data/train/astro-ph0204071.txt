    "in the past few decades , the turbulent character of the velocity field in the interstellar medium has been increasingly recognized ( zuckerman &  evans 1974 ; dickman 1985 ; scalo 1987 ; for recent works , see the volume by franco &  carramiana 1999 and the review by vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "due to the highly fluctuating character and sensitivity to initial conditions ( initial conditions arbitrarily close to each other separate exponentially in time ",
    "see , e.g. , lesieur 1990 ) of the turbulent motions , statistical tools become important in trying to characterize and understand the nature of interstellar turbulence .",
    "these tools become even more important with the continuous growth of both observed and theoretical data cubes , as it becomes necessary to compress such large data sets into a more manageable parameter space . on the observational side , studies of the centroid velocity probability distribution function ( @xmath4-pdf ) ( miesch &  scalo 1995 ; lis et al .",
    "1996 , miesch , scalo &  bally 1999 ) have compared the shape of the @xmath4-pdf for various observed regions and numerical simulations of incompressible or weakly compressible turbulence ; through the density and velocity autocorrelation functions , kleiner &  dickman ( 1984 ) have tried to infer the correlation length scale in taurus molecular cloud ; using structure tree statistics , houlahan &  scalo ( 1992 ) tried to discriminate between hierarchically - nested and random collections of clouds ; through principal component analysis and autocorrelation functions , heyer &  schloerb ( 1997 ) and brunt & heyer ( 2001 ) obtain the velocity dispersion - size relationship for both observations and pseudo - simulations , in a manner independent of how clouds are defined ; applying @xmath5variance analysis , stutzki et al .",

    "have given a method for recovering the power spectra of both the three - dimensional density and of the line - of - sight velocity from the emissivity power spectrum in velocity channels of spectroscopic data .",
    "on the numerical side , recent simulations of interstellar turbulence have allowed statistical studies of the simulated ism and clouds .",
    "in fact , again due to the sensitivity to initial conditions , modeling of individual turbulent objects is not feasible , and statistical modeling is again the appropriate way to proceed .",
    "it thus becomes appropriate to compare numerical simulations and observations using statistical methods .",
    "for example , falgarone et al . (",

    "( 2000 ) studied the projection of numerical mhd simulations , finding that the morphology of the channel maps resembles maps of the line of sight ( los ) of the velocity more closely than maps of the density field ; mac low &  ossenkopf ( 1999 ) have recently used the @xmath6-variance to find that the models with high mach numbers ( more than m @xmath7 4 ) are in better agreement with observations ; lazarian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have shown that the theoretical predictions of lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) are verified for simulated spectroscopic data from numerical simulations of ism turbulence .",
    "in particular , rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 1999 = rgww ) introduced a new method , called the `` spectral correlation function '' ( scf ) , which estimates the spatially - averaged correlation of spectra inside a box of size @xmath8 in spectroscopic data cubes .",
    "these authors used the scf to measure the correlation between spectra in neighboring positions , as an indicator of the degree of `` smoothness '' of both observational and numerical data cubes . with this method",
    ", they were able to distinguish between , for example , simulations with and without self - gravity , by comparing the variation of the scf upon randomization of the positions of the spectra on the plane of the sky ( pos ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the work of rgww , further exploring the capabilities of the scf to discriminate among numerical simulations of various turbulent regimes ( isothermal with large- and small - scale forcing , and ism - like ) , and to quantitatively compare them to spectroscopic observational data of diffuse hi gas . in order to do this",
    ", we construct spectral maps from the numerical data cubes assuming optically thin lines , with and without thermal broadening of lines . for non - isothermal gas ,",
    "the velocity structure of the colder gas may be `` hidden '' by the thermal broadening of the warmer gas .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  [ datos ] we describe both the observed hi data ( hartmann &  burton 1997 ) and the simulated data cubes used here , and explain the construction of the spectral maps for the simulations . in ",
    "[ spectral ] we briefly review the scf . in  [ resultados ]",
    "we apply the scf to the data sets , discussing the information that can be extracted from this procedure towards distinguishing between the various simulations and quantitatively estimating their similarity with observational data . in",
    " [ discussion ] we discuss the nature of the spatial structure of the scf , and discuss how the scf can be used to guide theoreticians to match their simulations with observational data .",
    "finally , in  [ conclusions ] we draw the main conclusions .",
    "we consider three numerical simulations in three dimensions . the first one , called simply ism , represents the ism in a box of 300 pc on a side , at a resolution of 100 points per dimension , centered on the galactic midplane at the solar galactocentric distance .",
    "full equations , details and a complete description of the model can be found in passot et al .",
    "( 1995 = pvp ) and pichardo et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "here we just mention that the code solves the full self - gravitating mhd equations , including that of the internal energy conservation with additional model terms representing the background plus local stellar heating and the radiative cooling .",
    "the local heating mimics stellar ionization heating , and is turned on ( `` an o star is formed '' ) when the local density reaches a threshold value of 10 times the mean density , producing local bubbles of warm gas that expand and feed the global turbulence .",
    "`` stars '' remain on for 2 myr .",
    "no supernova - like energy injection is included because of numerical limitations .",
    "the cooling is parameterized as a piecewise power - law function , as fitted to the cooling functions of dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) and of raymond , cox &  smith ( 1976 ) by rosen , bregman &  norman ( 1993 ) and rosen &  bregman ( 1995 ) ( see pvp and pichardo et al .",
    "the `` isothermal '' jeans length is twice the integration box size , although the presence of cooling gives an effective jeans length of roughly 2/3 the box size ( , , &  scalo 1999 ) .",
    "the mean density is 3.3 @xmath9 and the velocity , temperature and magnetic field units are , respectively , 6.4 km s@xmath10 , 3000 k and 5 @xmath11 g",
    ".    two limitations of the ism simulation should be mentioned .",
    "first of all , the lack of sn energy input implies that the simulations are somewhat less energetic than the actual ism .",
    "this fact will be quantified in ",
    "[ fine_tune ] . on the other hand",
    ", the heating and cooling functions used do not produce any thermally unstable temperature ranges , although we do not consider this to be a serious problem , as recent discussions by vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and gazol et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that the structural properties of the ism are more a consequence of the dynamical processes than of the thermal ones . on the other hand ,",
    "a true shortcoming is the absence of hot ( @xmath12 k ) gas , although recent work by various groups ( e.g. , gazol - patio & passot 1999 ; de avillez 2000 ) suggests that the filling factor of the this gas at the midplane is not larger than @xmath13% . in this case",
    ", the error commited by not including it is probably minor , as the main effect of this omission will be that in actual observations a fraction of the line of sight will contain `` holes '' in the cold / warm gas distribution , filled with hot ionized gas , which will be absent in our simulation data .",
    "given the low resolution of our simulations , this may actually constitute an advantage , as better sampling of the gas contributing to the hi line spectra along each los will be accomplished .    the second simulation , called ism - it , is similar to run ism , except that an isothermal regime is considered , with no cooling and heating terms , the isothermal jeans length is 1.1 times the box size , and a lower density threshold is used for initiating star formation , so that the star formation rate is similar to that of run ism in spite of the weaker gravity . in this run , which may be thought to represent gas within a molecular cloud at @xmath14  10  k , the stellar energy input proceeds via winds ( locally divergent source terms in the momentum equation ",

    "note that for run it , the forcing is active since the beginning of the simulation , while for runs ism and ism - it , the forcing is turned on only after the conditions for star formation mentioned above are met .      in order to produce `` spectra '' from the simulations",
    ", we generate two types of line profiles from the simulations . in one",
    ", we simply calculate density - weighted @xmath21-velocity histograms ( position - position - velocity cubes , or ppv ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the emission is optically thin , but also that the thermal broadening is negligible , so that what we see is directly the emission from each pixel at its physical velocity along the los .",
    "such spectra are produced by considering all points @xmath22 over the @xmath21-coordinate , and then creating a velocity axis by adding the contribution from each @xmath21-position to a velocity bin corresponding to its los - velocity ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we refer to these as not - thermally - broadened ( ntb ) spectra .",
    "these synthetic observations , although unsuitable for direct comparison with real observational data because the latter can not escape some level of thermal broadening , allow us to study the effects of velocity structure exclusively .    for the second type of spectra , we calculate the radiative transfer taking the density field in the simulation to correspond to the hi density , and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium , optically thin lines , and gaussian thermal broadening . in this case , every pixel `` emits '' at all velocities , but its emission is weighted by a gaussian profile centered at the fluid velocity of the pixel , and of width determined by the temperature at the pixel",
    ". we will refer to this kind of spectra as thermally - broadened ( tb ) spectra . in both cases , `` channel maps '' are then produced as intensity images over the remaining two spatial coordinates ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) at a given @xmath23 interval .    in fig .",
    "[ ejemplos_lineas ] we show the corresponding tb and ntb spectra for nine pixels around position @xmath26 of run ism .",
    "the dotted lines represent the tb spectra , while the bold solid lines represent the ntb spectra at low ( 16 velocity channels ) resolution , and the light solid lines represent the ntb spectra at high velocity resolution ( 64 channels ) .",
    "it is seen that the ntb spectra are much more irregular and spiky , because there are only 100 events in each , which are then redistributed in either 64 ( at high velocity - resolution ) or 16 ( at low velocity - resolution ) possible bins .",
    "note also that the spectra change substantially between the low- and high - resolution cases .",
    "in contrast , the tb spectra are much smoother , and they do not change so much with position on the pos , implying that thermal broadening `` hides '' the real velocity structure of the simulations .",
    "we will return to this point in  [ therm_broad ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that previous works constructing velocity histograms out of 3d numerical simulations have frequently added up the contribution from several neighbouring s. for example , falgarone ( 1994 ) , using @xmath27 simulations , considered data from a square box of 32 @xmath17 32 neighbouring s , thus including 524288 events for each individual spectrum .",
    "however , at the risk of being velocity under - sampled , in the present work we use only one  per spectrum , in order to avoid further deterioration of the already low on - the - sky spatial resolution imposed by the machine available to us ( a cray y - mp 4/64 ) .      as the source of observational data , we use the 21  cm hi data from the atlas of galactic neutral hydrogen ( hartmann &  burton 1997 ) obtained with the 25  m leiden / dwingeloo telescope . details of the observations and analysis may be found in the atlas .",
    "here we just mention that the velocity resolution is 1.03 , and that we use the velocity range from @xmath2820 to @xmath2920  ( the original data was taken from @xmath28450 to 400 . )",
    "we have chosen the north celestial pole loop as the comparison region .",
    "this is an extended hi region located at @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( see   [ caso_npl ] . )",
    "there are several reasons for this choice , mostly related to the fact that the ism simulation represents a well - defined region of space , while hi observations suffer from confusion along the los .",
    "first , it is a region that lies off the galactic plane , thus avoiding excessive contribution to the emission from very distant , physically unrelated regions .",
    "secondly , the presence of a well - defined physical structure ( the ncp loop ) reassures us that the emmision is mostly due to a well - confined region is space .",
    "finally , there are molecular clouds and stars that allow to have an estimation of the distance , at least to some of the molecular clouds in the region ( mbm 30 , @xmath32  pc ) , as well as an upper limit ( @xmath33  pc ) to other members ( mbm 29 ; see penprase 1993 ) .",
    "this implies that , if the emission lies at a distance of @xmath7  230  pc ( the mean between these two extremes ) , the dimensions of the analyzed region has a size @xmath7160  pc , comparable to the physical size of the ism simulation box .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the resolution of the  data changes with galactic latitude : it is 0.5  for @xmath34 35 ; 0.6  for 35@xmath35 45 ; and 0.7  for 45@xmath36 55 .",
    "this has the effect of slightly overestimating the scf at high latitudes , since we assume a uniform grid spacing of 0.5 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the development and advantages of the scf is given by rgww . for completeness , here we repeat the necessary definitions , give a physical interpretation of the scf , and then a discussion of the strategies for its application , and the effects of noise .      given two arbitrary spectra with antenna temperatures @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the scf is defined by rgww as :    @xmath39 ^ 2 dv\\over s^2\\int t_1 ^ 2(v - l)dv + \\int t^2_0(v)dv } } \\label{scf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 and @xmath8 are free parameters chosen as to minimize the integral @xmath41 ^ 2 dv$ ] .",
    "thus , for two identical spectra with infinite signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio , scf@xmath42 , while for two completely uncorrelated spectra , scf = 0 .    given the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath8 , rgww define four _ modes _ of the scf : a ) 0 @xmath43 scf@xmath44 , which compares the two spectra in their raw form .",
    "values of 0 close to unity imply that the spectra resemble each other in shape , amplitude and velocity offset .",
    "b ) @xmath43 scf@xmath45 , with @xmath40 chosen as to minimize @xmath46 .",
    "this form eliminates differences between the spectra arising from pure velocity offsets .",
    "values of close to unity imply that the spectra resemble each other in shape and amplitude , regardless of velocity offset .",
    "c ) @xmath43 scf@xmath47 , with @xmath8 chosen as to minimize @xmath46 .",
    "this form eliminates differences between the spectra arising from pure intensity scalings .",
    "values of close to unity imply that the spectra resemble each other in shape and velocity offset , regardless of absolute amplitude .",
    "d ) @xmath43 scf@xmath48 , with both @xmath8 and @xmath40 chosen as to minimize @xmath46 .",
    "this is then the general definition of the scf ( eq .   [ [ scf ] ] ) , and eliminates differences arising from both velocity offset and amplitude . in this case , values close to unity imply that the two spectra resemble each other in shape only .      as has been shown by rgww",
    "( see also padoan , rosolowsky and goodman 2001 = prg ) , the scf can be strongly affected by noise and their effects has to be evaluated .",
    "prg propose to `` clean '' the effects of the noise by dividing the actual value of the scf by an `` optimal value '' of the scf , i.e. , by the maximum value that the scf would have if the only difference between both spectra were the random noise .",
    "the optimal value is given by ( see pgr )    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the `` spectrum quality '' , defined as    @xmath51    where in turn @xmath52 is the mean rms noise , @xmath53 is the number of velocity channels , @xmath54 is their width , and @xmath55 is the mean value of the emission in the velocity interval .",
    "as can be seen , for high values of the signal - to - noise ratio , the parameter @xmath50 goes to infinity , and the scf is renormalized by a number close to unity .",
    "pgr show that adding noise to both the observed ( molecular , with signal - to - noise values of the order of a few ) and the synthetic ( without intrinsic noise ) spectra until the signal - to - noise ratio is constant throughout the data , and renormalizing the scf as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ renormalization ] ) , gives values of the scf essentially independent of the noise level .    in the present work we deal with data that are almost not affected by noise : on one hand , the numerical simulations are intrinsically noiseless ; on the other , for the hi data ( hartmann &  burton 1997 , see  [ datos ] ) , the characteristic value of @xmath52 is 0.07  k and its characteristic antena temperature value is of several k , suggesting high values of @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , we have verified that for the observed data set ( ) used here , the mean value of @xmath50 is 98.8 ( see  [ caso_npl ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper we do not correct for the effects of noise .      in order to compute the four kinds of the scf , in particular , the modes   and , which imply shifting one spectrum with respect to the other , rgww use velocity channels within 3 fwhms of the velocity centroid , with the fwhm and the velocity centroid computed by fitting a gaussian to the line profiles . in turn ,",
    "prg use a 10  @xmath56 velocity window , where @xmath56 is the standard deviation of the velocity of a spectrum created by averaging over the whole map .",
    "however , in our case of negligible noise , we simply extend the original data sets ( observational and synthetic ) by adding zeros on both sides of the spectral lines to produce a spectral window three times wider than the original .",
    "the scf , like the regular autocorrelation function , is in general a function of spatial separation , and this aspect of it is dicussed by prg .",
    "however , rgww has used it in a `` local '' mode , which we follow here . in this form ,",
    "we construct maps of the average value of the scf in boxes of 3 pixels per side in a given spectral map . that is , to each point on the @xmath57 plane ( the pos of the simulations ) we assign the average value of the scf evaluated using that point and each of its eight nearest neighbors .",
    "note that with this approach , the scf maps are useful for exhibiting small - scale spatial variations in the line spectra . in addition , in order to quantify the similarity between spectral maps , rgww also considered the distribution ( histogram ) of the scf in a given map and its moments , and we follow this approach here .    in practice",
    ", the nearest - neighbor variant of the scf used here acts like an angle - average of the spatial ( i.e. , in the pos ) derivative of the spectral profiles .",
    "sites of strong profile variation appear in the scf maps as low values ( dark ) , and soft variations appear as large values ( bright ) .",
    "that is , the scf stresses small - scale changes ( on the pos ) in the _ line spectra_. moreover , the fact that the scf considers the whole velocity structure in the line profiles at each position , implies that maps of the scf give more information than the channel maps alone , because they make _ velocity _ variations ( as well as density ones ) evident to the eye , which might escape examination of pairs of channel maps .",
    "the scf histogram moments then quantify such velocity _ and _ intensity differences .",
    "in order to `` calibrate '' the scf , and to determine its response upon changes in the spectral resolution and thermal broadening , we have simulated four different `` observations '' of run ism , labeled 16-tb , 16-ntb , 64-tb and 64-ntb , where the number indicates the number of velocity channels , and the letters tb / ntb indicate whether or not thermal broadening was included .",
    "we also have produced another set ( tb and ntb ) of `` observations '' of this run , but with the velocity artifitially multiplied by a factor of 6 , in order for the line spectra and the scf histograms to better match those for the ncp loop .",
    "this will be discussed in  [ fine_tune ] .",
    "velocity channel maps , maps of the scf , and scf histograms are respectively shown in figs .",
    "[ ism_vel_chan ] , [ ism maps scf ] and [ ism_hist ] .",
    "each case ( 16/64 velocity channels , and tb / ntb ) is indicated on the top of each figure .      comparing the ntb channel maps ( figs .",
    "[ ism_vel_chan]b and d ) , we note that at higher velocity resolution the small - scale structure is more prominent , a fact already noted by pichardo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and interpreted by henney ,  & pichardo ( 2001 ) in terms of the presence of `` caustics '' or `` cusps '' ( loci of high intensity due to velocity crowding ) in the position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data cube .",
    "we will return to these caustics in ",
    "[ worms_caustics ]",
    ". however , this effect is almost non - existent in the more realistic tb case .",
    "additionally , it can be seen that the ntb map at low velocity ( or `` spectral '' ) resolution ( fig .",
    "[ ism maps scf]b ) exhibits a clear `` wormy '' or `` stringy '' structure , probably related to the caustics mentioned above (  [ fine_tune ] .",
    "however , the wormy structure is almost absent from the high - resolution scf maps ( fig  [ ism maps scf]d ) .",
    "this is an artifact of the low _ spatial _ resolution of our simulations ( 100 grid points per dimension ) , which causes any given point in the simulated pos to have very few points along the los contributing to the intensity in any one velocity channel ( less than two on average at a velocity resolution of 64 channels ) , in turn causing the line profiles to be highly irregular ( cf .",
    "[ ejemplos_lineas ] ) .",
    "thus , the little signal available is diluted over many velocity channels , and only the most promintent features are preserved , with a very `` blurred '' quality .",
    "this shows that the effective velocity resolution is in effect limited by the spatial resolution .",
    "the scattered character of the ntb line profiles at high velocity resolution is also evident in their corresponding scf histograms ( fig .",
    "[ ism_hist]d ) , which are clearly much wider and have lower mean values than the low - resolution ones ( fig .",
    "[ ism_hist]b ) , indicating that the profiles vary strongly among neighboring los .",
    "we now turn to the effects of thermal broadening on velocity channel and scf maps , and on the scf histograms . for the discussion , we consider only the low - velocity resolution observations , due to the poor statistics present in the high - resolution ones .",
    "it is first important to note that run ism contains large regions occupied by warm ( @xmath58 k gas , whose thermal velocity dispersion dominates the line profiles at any given position on the pos , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ejemplos_lineas ] .",
    "this is because , even though the low - temperature regions ( clouds ) contain supersonic motions , these motions are subsonic compared to the sound speed of the warm medium .",
    "moreover , the warm gas is barely transonic with respect to itself .",
    "thus , _ the thermal broadening due to the warm gas along the los masks the bulk velocity structure _ seen in the profiles , which are nearly perfectly gaussian in the tb case , in contrast with the extremely irregular profiles seen in the ntb case .",
    "this effect is expected to occur in actual observations of multi - temperature atomic gas , so that the velocity structure of the cold hi gas may only be seen in absorption ( gibson et al .",
    "2000 ; heiles 2001 ) .",
    "this effect is also seen in the channel maps .",
    "the structure in the ntb channel maps , regardless of resolution , can be described as having the appearance of superposed veils , with sharp , bright edges delimiting fainter regions .",
    "in contrast , the tb channel maps are much smoother , losing the veil - like appearance , and becoming more similar to maps of the total integrated intensity .",
    "thus , only the gross features such as large - scale velocity gradients remain noticeable . again , this effect is also expected to occur in actual observational data of warm gas .    in the scf maps , the `` wormy '' nature of the ntb cases , mentioned in  [ vel_res ] , is seen to lose its small - scale part in the tb maps .",
    "that is , the `` worms '' in the ntb case appear to `` bundle up '' into larger - scale filaments , in a sort of self - similar or hierarchical manner .",
    "however , in the tb scf maps , only the bundles appear to be preserved , while their smaller constitutive filaments are not seen . as will be discussed in",
    " [ discussion ] , the small - scale filaments , if originated by the caustics in the ppv cube , would be an artifact of the velocity segregation of the data upon the process of a spectroscopic observation . thus , thermal broadening has the fortunate effect of counteracting this spurious small - scale generation by the velocity separation effected by the observation process .",
    "another important feature is that the scf maps for the tb observations have a much smaller dynamic range than the ntb ones , indicating a much lower variability of the scf in the former case although , on the other hand , the same overall structures are seen in both types of maps .",
    "the scf histograms clearly reflect the above effects .",
    "while the histograms of the ntb observations have large variances ( fig.[ism_hist]b ) and moderate mean values , those for the tb ( fig.[ism_hist]a ) cases are much narrower and with means very close to unity , the maximum possible value of the correlation .",
    "the small variances and large means of the tb cases again indicate the `` erasure '' of the velocity structure by the thermal broadening , which causes all spectra to be much more similar to each other than in the ntb cases .",
    "this furthermore indicates that the structure seen in the tb scf maps should be due mostly to variations in intensity rather than in velocity structure .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by the fact that , in the tb cases , the histograms of , which can compensate for intensity variations but not for velocity shifts , are much tighter ( have smaller variances ) than those of , which compensates in the opposite manner . instead",
    ", in the ntb cases , the histograms of  have comparable ( in the low velocity resolution case ) or even larger ( in the high - resolution case ) variances than the histograms of , indicating that in this case the variability in the maps is due mainly to the velocity structure .",
    "we now compare these results with two other numerical simulations . as mentioned in  [ datos_simulaciones ] , we consider an isothermal simulation including the magnetic field and self - gravity ( called ism - it ) on one hand , and a simple isothermal simulation ( called it ) on the other .",
    "given the strong masking effect of thermal broadening discussed in the previous section , in this section we discuss only ntb cases , so that the velocity structure is fully accesible to the scf .",
    "however , note that this can not be done in the case of real observational data .",
    "figures [ it_vel_chan]a , and b show the velocity channels for cases ism - it and it , respectively . the veil - like structure described for run ism is also present in runs it and ism - it , although in the latter the veils are more roundish , somewhat resembling soap bubbles , or peanut shells .",
    "this is most likely a reflection of the intermediate - scale forcing applied to run it ( in scales of about 1/4 of the box ) , in contrast with the small - scale forcing acting on runs ism and ism - it , due to the stellar sources .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field in runs ism and ism - it is probably also a factor contributing to the more elongated structures present there , the magnetic to thermal pressure ratio , is less meaningful than in isothermal simulations , since both the magnetic and thermal pressure are not constant and , in fact , @xmath59 is a local quantity , spanning a factor of at least 3 orders of magnitude . ] .",
    "another evident distinction between the runs is that very - large - scale structures ( runing diagonally from one side of the box to the other ) of roughly half of the box size ) , which are present in run ism ( see e.g. , velocity channel at @xmath60  in fig  [ ism_vel_chan]b ) , are absent from cases it and ism - it .",
    "this is because of the smaller effective jeans length in run ism (  [ datos_simulaciones ] ) .",
    "thus , such large - scale structures in run ism have a gravitational origin , but have no counterpart in runs ism - it and it .",
    "the scf maps of runs ism - it and it ( figs .",
    "[ it_maps_scf]a and b ) continue to show the `` wormy '' appearance described for run ism , although the `` worms '' form rounder bundles in run it , due to the also rounder shapes of the structures seen in its channel maps .",
    "the scf histograms for all three runs ( figs .  [ ism maps scf]b and [ it_maps_scf]a and b ) have comparable means and variances",
    "however , the histograms for runs in which star formation is active ( runs ism and ism - it ) seem to have more extended low - correlation tails , and therefore more negative values of the skewness .",
    "this appears to be a consequence of the greater abundance of shells and shocks in cases with active star - formation , and thus suggests that _ the histograms of the scf are capable of `` sensing '' the presence of these structures , representing them by large negative skewness values_. unfortunately , the correspondence is not unique : the phenomena that can cause a large low - scf tails are not limited to shocks and shells .",
    "any sharp changes in the gas structure , either in density or in los - velocity , or even in the ppv cubes ( e.g. , the caustics ) , can cause them .",
    "thus , the method can not be used to unambiguously identify shocks and shells . instead , the existence of low - scf tails in the histograms should be taken only as suggestive of their possible presence , which should be then verified by other means .",
    "we now apply the scf to the hi maps of the north celestial pole ( ncp ) loop , a region possibly formed by a nearby supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , pound &  goodman 1997 ) . in fig .",
    "[ npl]a we show the channel maps for this region , which contains an arc - shaped structure appearing at positive velocities , and a clear large - scale velocity gradient : at large negative velocities most of the emission is concentrated at high longitude and low latitude , while at large positive velocities most of the emission comes from the arc and is concentrated in the upper half of the region .",
    "as we mentioned before (  [ observaciones ] ) , the reason for choosing this region is that it is a high - latitude region , avoiding the contribution to the emission from physically disconnected regions far away in the line of sight , and that the determination of the distance to some molecular clouds allows us to assume that the size of the region is about 160  pc , comparable to the size of the simulations ( 300  pc ) .",
    "figure [ npl]b then shows the scf maps for this region .",
    "several points are apparent .",
    "first , the `` wormy '' structure seen in all the simulations is also seen in the ncp loop , particularly in the arc region , indicating the presence of shocks or caustics in the field (   [ vel_res ] and [ discussion ] ) . in this case , it is natural to assume that it is primarily shocks that are causing the `` worms '' , the ncp loop being an expanding shell .",
    "second , we see that the scf maps only contain structure around the arc , and not near the bottom , where rather featureless emission is seen in the channel maps , indicating that _ the local form of the scf used in this paper eliminates roughly uniform regions , and highlights regions of strong variability_. another consequence of this behavior is that _ the local form of the scf eliminates large - scale velocity gradients , as indicated by the fact that no sign of the gradient seen in the channel map set is apparent in the scf maps_. although this is in a sense obvious , it makes the local scf maps a powerful tool for studying the small - scale intensity and velocity structure . in particular , the scf should make a good shell - identification tool , in the sense that we can quantify , using the skewness of the histograms , the relative importance of sharp edges ( shells ) of gas .    also worth noting is the fact that the map of  contains significantly lower values of the correlation compared to the map of , indicating that most of the variability is due to the intensity rather than to the velocity structure .",
    "this is also seen in the scf histogram for  ( fig .",
    "[ npl]c ) , which shows a more extended low - correlation tail , and consequently a larger negative skewness than the  histogram .",
    "however , these features may instead be an indication that thermal broadening is not negligible for this region , thus partially `` blinding '' the scf to the velocity structure . if this is so , then the thermal broadening should be of 3 - 5  , since the total width of the hi line profiles for this region is about 8 - 10  , such that the total width comes from the turbulent structure , but the thermal broadening does not allow to see in detail such turbulent velocity structure . indeed",
    ", it is noteworthy that the histograms of  for the simulations have larger negative skewnesses than those of  in the thermally broadened cases , but the opposite is true for the ntb cases , supporting this view .",
    "this is also probably the reason why the featureless emission at the bottom of the channel maps does not contain `` worms '' associated to the small - scale velocity structure in the scf maps .",
    "the local form of the scf as used in this paper is by definition sensitive only to small - scale features ( either in intensity or in velocity ) .",
    "specifically , structural features in the scf maps correspond to _ steep gradients in the plane of the sky _ of the line profiles shape and/or amplitude .",
    "in particular , shocks and the caustics discussed by henney et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are especially well suited for detection by the local scf .    for clarity , a brief summary of the results of henney et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is in order here .",
    "essentially , the process of performing a spectroscopic observation amounts to performing a mapping from the real , three - dimensional physical space onto position - position - velocity ( ppv ) space ( see also lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; pichardo et al.2000 ) . as is well known , `` caustics '' form in ppv space at places where the mapping is not single - valued .",
    "i.e. , where finite - length line - of - sight segments contribute to infinitesimal velocity intervals , causing a diverging intensity at those sites in the ppv cube ( a phenomenon known as `` velocity crowding '' ) . with finite - width velocity channels ,",
    "the intensity does not diverge , but still reaches large values at the caustics .",
    "the latter are surfaces in the ppv cube , and in general intersect the velocity channels ( constant - velocity planes in the ppv cube ) at finite angles along lines which show up as elongated , `` worm''-like features in the channel maps .",
    "this structure is spurious in the sense that it does not correspond to any actual density features in the original physical space . in the case of sharply - defined velocity channels , the spurious structure reaches arbitrarily small scales as the velocity resolution is increased . upon thermal broadening , the minimum scale present is explicitly calculated by henney et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "this spurious small - scale structure may however be picked out by the local scf , showing up as the `` worms '' we have mentioned repeatedly .",
    "however , if the thermal broadening is very strong ( i.e. , the velocities are strongly subsonic ) , the caustics become thicker and less intense in ppv space , so that the `` worms '' become wider and fainter .",
    "thus , as already mentioned in  [ therm_broad ] , thermal broadening present in real spectroscopic observations has the fortunate effect of counteracting the spurious small - scale generated by the synthetic observation process , although at the cost of blurring the velocity information .",
    "the other possible type of small - scale feature that is naturally picked out by the local scf is shocked shells .",
    "contrary to the caustics , shocks are real features in 3d space , and , since they imply supersonic velocity differences occurring over very small scales , it is possible that they `` survive '' thermal broadening .",
    "we conclude that , when thermal broadening is not negligible , `` worms '' in scf maps are most likely to correspond to real velocity features  shocks .",
    "however , for extremely supersonic motions where thermal broadening is negligible , it is possible that the scf may not be able to distinguish between them and the spurious caustics .",
    "further work is necessary to quantify and distinguish caustics and shocks through the scf .",
    "the scf is intended to provide a quantitative means of comparing numerical simulations and observations , which should then allow workers to adjust their simulations to make them match the observational data as closely as possible . in this section",
    "we show an example of how this can be done .    comparing both the ntb and the tb 16-channel scf histograms of the ism simulation ( figs .",
    "[ ism_hist]a and b ) with those of the ncp loop ( fig.[npl]c ) , we note that neither set of the simulation histograms is a very good match of those of the ncp loop , and instead seem to bracket the latter .",
    "the ntb histograms are too broad and have smaller means than the ncp loop ones , while the opposite is true of the tb histograms .",
    "in particular , the narrowness of the tb histograms suggests that the thermal width dominates the line spectra of the simulation , causing them to be very similar , all being very close to gaussians .",
    "indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ejemplos_lineas ] , the thermally broadened profiles have lost essentially all the velocity information and are strongly dominated by the thermal component . instead , the 16-channel ntb profiles are very spiky and do not look like realistic profiles .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ therm_broad ] , we attribute this problem to the fact that , even though the cold gas contains supersonic motions , these motions are not supersonic compared to the thermal speed of the warm gas , and thus the velocity information of the cold gas is swamped in the thermal width of the warm gas .",
    "this is a real effect , and we expect it to affect the ncp loop data .",
    "however , it moreover occurs that the latter include the contribution from gas moving at significantly larger velocities , most likely due to large shell expansion velocities ( see pound &  goodman 1997 ) .",
    "instead , the simulation only contains motions in the interval @xmath61 km s@xmath62 km s@xmath63 , as it includes only hii region - like expanding shells , but not supernova remnant - like ones , which would have much larger velocities .",
    "thus , in the hi data there exists quite a larger velocity range , which `` escapes '' the thermal smoothing .",
    "this suggests that , in order to make the simulated line profiles more realistic , we should `` expand '' the los - velocity axis by some factor , until the `` right '' ratio of non - thermal velocity range to thermal width is obtained .",
    "the expansion factor can be determined by matching the scf histograms of the simulation with thermal broadening and velocity expansion to those of the hi data .",
    "we find that expanding the velocity axis by a factor of 6 gives the best match , as shown in figs .",
    "[ sim_fix]a and b , which respectively present the scf histograms for the thermally - broadened , velocity - expanded simulation data and some selected line profiles . note also that , since the line profiles of fig .",
    "[ sim_fix]b appear significantly more realistic , this figure also shows the extent to which the velocity structure is hidden by the thermal broadening , by comparing the solid lines ( thermally broadenend spectra ) to the dotted lines ( actual velocity histograms along the los ) .    note that the matching can still be improved , as other differences between the simulation and the ncp loop data still remain at the next level of refinement : first , although we have matched the mean and standard deviation of the scf histograms , the skewnesses and kurtoses of the simulation data are considerably smaller than those of the ncp loop data .",
    "this is a reflection that in the ncp loop channel scf maps there exist regions of very low values of the scf corresponding to the arc , which is a strong and large feature , while no such prominent structures are present in the simulation data .",
    "second , the histograms of have larger ( negative ) skewnesses than the histograms of , while the opposite is true for the simulation histograms . as mentioned in  [ caso_npl ]",
    ", we have interpreted this as a consequence that in the ncp loop scf maps the variability has a larger contribution from intensity variations , while in the simulation data there seems to be a larger contribution from velocity variation along an los .",
    "thus , it seems that better matches could be obtained by comparing the simulation data to a region of sky without such a prominent feature , although for brevity we do not pursue this further here , as we believe that the potential of the scf to guide the simulations to match the observational data has been sufficiently exemplified .",
    "certainly , the velocity expansion we have done here is not a self - consistent fix to the simulation , as the correct thing to do would be to re - scale the whole simulation to galactic scales , and to correctly take into account the disk rotation and stratification , as well as more powerful sources of energy ( supernovae ) capable of accelerating the gas to higher velocities .",
    "the conclusion is that our simulations represent a much less turbulent medium than the actual ism , as implied by their smaller velocity dispersion compared to the velocity dispersion of the h  i gas .",
    "this exercise has shown the potential of the scf to pick out differences between the hi and simulation ppv data , and to point towards the physical ingredients that are lacking in the simulations for them to be better models of a given type of observation .",
    "in this paper we have presented further discussion on the spectral correlation function ( scf ) , in addition to that given by rgww and prg , and then applied it to data from numerical simulations of the ism and from hi data ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) of the north celestial pole ( ncp ) loop .",
    "the application to the numerical data , for which all the information on the distribution of the physical variables is known , allows us to understand the response of the various scf measurements used here on the velocity structure in the simulations .",
    "this understanding was then used to interpret the results of applying the scf to the ncp loop data , and to suggest modifications to the parameters of the ism simulation to better match the observational data .    in this paper , as in rgww , the scf has been used in a `` local '' form , in which the scf between one position in a map and its nearest neighbors is calculated and assigned as an `` intensity '' to that position , thus producing _ maps _ of the scf . thus ,",
    "structural features in the scf maps correspond to _ sharp gradients _ in the line profiles shape and/or amplitude on the plane of the sky . also , histograms of the scf values in the maps have been studied .",
    "this procedure has been applied to all four `` modes '' of the scf , 0 , ,  and .",
    "the behavior of the scf with separation , similarly to the more familiar case of regular correlation functions in hydrodynamics ( see , e.g. , lesieur 1990 ) , is discussed by prg .",
    "we first reviewed basic definitions concerning the scf , in particular the four `` modes '' , which allow the scf to focus on spectral similarities in either total intensity , velocity structure , none , or both .",
    "we then considered the effect of noise , and showed that in the case of hi ( and certainly in the case of numerical simulations ) it is not an issue , allowing us to neglect its effects in the subsequent discussion .    in the absence of thermal broadening ,",
    "the scf maps of all simulations exhibited a strikingly `` wormy '' structure , with an interesting kind of self - similarity in which the smallest - scale `` worms '' bundle up to form larger - scale ones .",
    "the `` worms '' may be associated to caustics in the position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data cube ( loci of high intensity due to velocity crowding ) , discussed by henney et al .",
    "such caustics are not a real feature of the physical fields , but are generated by the sepctroscopic observation process , and they are certainly present in the ppv cube , strongly influencing the structure seen in the channel maps .",
    "their presence causes the scf histograms to broaden , and to have lower mean values and larger negative skewnesses .",
    "application of the scf to a multi - temperature , self - gravitating mhd simulation of the ism at intermediate scales ( 3 - 300 pc ) , showed that thermal broadening may dominate the spectral lines when the warm gas is primarily subsonic , even if cold , locally supersonic regions exist along the line of sight ( assuming optically thin lines ) , as these regions are still sub- or trans - sonic with respect to the warmer gas .",
    "this caused the small - scale structure ( which also typically consists of smaller velocity amplitudes ) to disappear from the thermally - broadened ( tb ) scf maps compared to the non - thermally broadened ( ntb ) ones , and the tb scf histograms to be much narrower and with higher mean values than their ntb counterparts .",
    "this implies that in the case of the multi - temperature hi data much of the small - scale velocity structure associated with the colder gas may be unobservable in emission , and is possibly only accessible through self - absorption features in the line profiles .",
    "we then applied the scf to two isothermal runs , one including stellar energy injection , self - gravity and the magnetic field ( run ism - it ) , which may be representative of molecular gas , and one without all these ingredients and forced at large scales ( run it ) .",
    "we did not consider thermal broadening for these runs because nearly isothermal ( molecular ) gas in the ism is generally very supersonic , at least above scales @xmath64 pc .",
    "the channel maps for these runs were seen to be markedly different from those for run ism , lacking the largest - scale structures formed by large - scale gravitational instability in the latter run ( run ism - it has a jeans length larger than the simulation size , and run it has no gravity at all ) .",
    "however , scf maps of the isothermal runs were not found to be so different , because the `` local '' scf used in this paper focuses on small - scale structure .",
    "the scf histograms of simulations ism and ism - it , which have active star - forming regimes and thus contain stronger , more numerous shocks , tend to have more extended tails at low values of the scf , and thus large negative skewnesses . this appears to be due to the strong spectral and intensity variations caused by the shocks , suggesting that large negative skewnesses in the scf histograms is indicative of the presence of shocks and/or shells in the physical fields .",
    "unfortunately , other structures in the gas , or even artifacts in the ppv cube such as the caustics , can also produce such low - scf tails in the histograms , and thus the indication can not be completely unambiguous .",
    "then , scf maps and histograms of the ncp loop region were analyzed .",
    "the `` wormy '' structure is seen in the maps for this case also , indicating that the caustics are a real concern .",
    "moreover , the histograms also exhibit large negative skewnesses , due to the prominence of the shell - like structure in this region , in agreement with the suggestion from the simulation data .",
    "we then proceeded to show how the scf can be used to `` fine tune '' the simulations to better match the observations .",
    "indeed , the means and standard deviations of the ntb and tb simulation histograms are seen to bracket the corresponding values for the ncp loop histograms , and in fact the tb line profiles are seen to be completely thermally dominated , with virtually no velocity information left . attributing this effect to the fact that the ism simulation contains a rather limited velocity contrast , we were able to obtain a much better match to the ncp loop scf histograms , and much more realistic line profiles , by `` expanding '' the velocity range by a factor of 6 , indicating that the simulation requires stronger sources of energy to generate larger velocity dispersion .",
    "in other words , we found that the simulations presented here are less energetic than the gas in the ncp region .",
    "we conclude that the local mode of the scf used here has the ability to quantify the presence of specific velocity and structural features in observational data such as shocks / shells , as well as to allow a quantitative comparison between observational and simulation data .",
