    "the puzzle of inclusive nonleptonic @xmath0 decays started out several years ago as the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurement of the semileptonic branching ratio  @xcite .",
    "theoretical analyses found it difficult to accomodate @xmath10 below 0.125  @xcite , while the experimental value is  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the weighted average of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . at @xmath15 factories overlooked potentially significant effects  @xcite .",
    "] it was realized that there is a large uncertainty in the theoretical estimate of the @xmath16 rate .",
    "the rate could increase due to either a small charm quark mass or a failure of local duality  @xcite , lowering the prediction for @xmath10 down to the experimental value .",
    "it would do so , however , at the expense of boosting the charm multiplicity per @xmath0 decay ( @xmath17 ) to around 1.3 which is significantly larger than the current experimental value  @xcite : @xmath18 the puzzle was thus rephrased as the inability of theory and experiment to agree simultaneously on @xmath10 and @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the inclusion of finite charm masses in next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations was found to enhance the @xmath16 rate by about 30%  @xcite .",
    "the nlo calculations , however , are not complete ( because penguin effects have not yet been included to nlo ) and also suffer from large uncertainties due to charm quark mass , renormalization scale and @xmath19 .",
    "more significantly , the calculation is based on the underlying questionable assumption of local quark - hadron duality .",
    "while duality assumes an inclusive rate based on 3-body phase space , the @xmath20 transitions proceed sizably as quasi - two body modes , which may enhance the inclusive @xmath20 rate considerably  @xcite .",
    "it was then shown  @xcite that the uncertainty in @xmath16 can be circumvented by noting that @xmath10 and @xmath17 satisfy a linear relation with the theoretical input of and @xmath21 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath22 the above estimate of @xmath23 is based on a complete nlo calculation with finite charm quark mass and non - perturbative corrections up to @xmath24 ) . under the assumption of local duality ,",
    "the error is dominated by the scale dependence and not by the uncertainties in quark masses and in @xmath19 . combining the accurately measured @xmath10 with the predicted @xmath23 and with conventional assumptions regarding charmless yields in inclusive",

    "@xcite deduced @xmath25 by simple accounting of the then observed ` wrong - charm ' yields or by studying the dalitz plot distribution of the @xmath16 transition , a significant ` wrong - charm ' @xmath26 production was predicted , @xmath27 where @xmath26 represents @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "subsequently , a sizable wrong charm @xmath26 yield in @xmath12 decays has been observed by both cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite at approximately half the level as predicted .",
    "the observation of the wrong - charm @xmath26 s does not alleviate the charm deficit problem , since the input to the experimental value of @xmath17 is the total inclusive yield of @xmath30 and @xmath26 combined .",
    "@xcite tried to solve the charm deficit problem and related issues by reducing @xmath1 sizably below the current world average .",
    "however , a recent precise measurement by aleph @xcite , @xmath31 , agrees with previous measurements .",
    "this indicated that inclusive @xmath0 decays may not be well understood @xcite , and caused us to carefully reassess every input into the puzzle .    in this note ,",
    "we take full advantage of newly available measurements , in particular the flavor - tagged yields of @xmath30 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and systematically identify the source of the charm deficit to be the final states with neither open @xmath4 nor open @xmath34 .",
    "this branching fraction is denoted by @xmath35 , and is experimentally well - defined .",
    "it is the branching fraction to final states with no weakly decaying charmed hadrons , i.e. those states for which there can be no separate decay vertex resulting from weakly decaying charm .",
    "this report then gives a plausible mechanism within the framework of the standard model .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section ii , we estimate @xmath36 in two ways : method a focuses on the @xmath4 quark in @xmath5 transitions , and method b focuses on the @xmath6 quark in @xmath37 transitions . while method a uses experimental data and involves minimal theoretical input , method b requires a theoretical estimate for @xmath23 . section iii averages over methods a and b ( referred to as method c ) , which reduces errors significantly .",
    "method c gives our best estimate of @xmath36 , while the difference between methods a and b checks the self consistency of the analysis .",
    "we find that the experimental data are self consistent and that @xmath36 is significantly larger than traditional estimates .",
    "we then put forward a hypothesis that a sizable component of @xmath38 pairs are seen as light hadrons and not as open charm  @xcite through non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "section iv discusses the systematics of the analysis , which includes correlations among the experimental and theoretical inputs .",
    "conclusions and some implications can be found in the last section .",
    "this report distinguishes flavor - specific branching fractions  @xmath40 and @xmath41  from the flavor - blind yield per b decay @xmath42 the branching fractions quoted by experiments are the average number of particle @xmath43 per @xmath0 decay ( weighted over charged and neutral @xmath0 productions ) . when the particle @xmath43 is a charmed hadron , however , it is safe to assume that the average number of particle per decay is the same as the branching fraction .",

    "then , accounting for the weakly decaying charmed hadrons originating from the @xmath4 quark in the @xmath51 transitions , we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 with @xmath54 being charmonia not seen as @xmath55 , and @xmath56 denotes any of the weakly decaying charmed baryons ( namely , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) . the branching fraction @xmath59 is small , and estimated to be @xmath60 where @xmath61 accounts for the larger qcd corrections in @xmath62 transitions  @xcite with respect to those in @xmath63  @xcite . aside from this tiny correction ,",
    "method a involves essentially no theoretical input .",
    "the experimental inputs used in ( [ eq : noopenc - a ] ) are given in tables i - iii .",
    "table i shows the flavor - blind number of each particle type per b decay ( @xmath64 ) and table iii shows the flavor - specific content of each yield .",
    "together , they provide flavor - specific branching fractions needed in ( [ eq : noopenc - a ] ) .",
    "we have used consistent values for the key branching fractions of charm decays .",
    "the updated values are summarized in table ii .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath65 is taken to be the new world average after the warsaw 96 conference  @xcite : @xmath66 both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are measured model - independently and are proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the measured ratios are given in table ii .",
    "using the values in tables i  iii and the definition @xmath69 the flavor - specific ` wrong - sign ' @xmath26 ( @xmath29 or @xmath28 ) yield is @xmath70 the same quantity can be inferred from the aleph measurement of @xmath71  @xcite to be ( see appendix ) @xmath72 the cleo and aleph results are consistent with each other within two standard deviations .",
    "the agreement is mildly encouraging since they have been measured using completely different methods .",
    "the ` right - sign ' @xmath30 yield as well as the flavor - specific yields of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are obtained similarly to ( [ eq : dbarcleo ] ) .",
    "the flavor - specific @xmath73 production in @xmath12 decays has been measured to be small by cleo  @xcite ( see table iii ) .",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed by aleph  @xcite .",
    "the most accurate measurements regarding charmed baryon production in @xmath0 decays involve @xmath33 baryons .",

    "@xcite inferred the inclusive @xmath56 yields by correlating them to the more accurately measured @xmath33 yields ( see appendix ) .",
    "it predicted the @xmath74 production to be drastically reduced with regard to the measured central value  @xcite .",
    "the drastic reduction can be traced back to a large enhancement in the absolute br scale of @xmath74 decays , a conclusion supported by recent work of voloshin  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the second way ( method b ) of estimating @xmath75 which is to account for the @xmath6 quark in @xmath76 transitions . noting that , apart from charmonia , the @xmath6 quark hadronizes to @xmath26 , @xmath77 , or @xmath78",

    "1 shows the estimates of @xmath90 as functions of @xmath91 using cleo data only .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath91 is well within the overlap of the two bands , which represent methods a and b. this indicates self consistency of the inputs .",
    "the errors in methods a and b are highly correlated . for example , when the ratio of wrong - sign to right - sign @xmath30 s ( @xmath92 ) fluctuates upward , the value given by a will increase while that given by b will decrease .",
    "the best estimate of @xmath90 can be obtained by averaging over methods a and b , where the errors due to flavor - specific fractions ( namely , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; see table iii ) cancel : @xmath95 the correlations are properly taken into account in the error estimation . the value is much larger than the traditional estimate of @xmath96 .",

    "the @xmath100 transitions are not large ( @xmath101 ) because of the small value of @xmath102 , while the @xmath50 transitions have been argued to be small due to the small wilson coefficients of penguin operators  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath107 predictions used published calculations for decay constants of @xmath108 and related their yields to that of @xmath109 assuming color - suppressed factorization , which can not be justified theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the total yield of other charmonia including those not expected from factorization ( such as @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) were assumed to be @xmath112 . )",
    "is clearly unreliable and one should search for not only @xmath113 in @xmath0 decays  @xcite but also for other @xmath114 , such as @xmath115 .",
    "] adding up ( [ nocest ] ) and ( [ ccbarest ] ) , we obtain @xmath116    the traditional estimate ( [ noopencest ] ) falls far below @xmath117 .",
    "though estimate ( [ ccbarest ] ) is unreliable due to the questionable assumptions made , we do not expect the true conventional @xmath118 production to be large enough to explain the bulk of the discrepancy . what could be the source of such a large enhancement of @xmath90 ?",
    "new physics is one possible solution  @xcite .",
    "but before drawing that conclusion , all standard model explanations , including non - perturbative effects , have to be ruled out .",
    "we hypothesize that non - perturbative effects could cause a significant fraction of @xmath38 pairs produced in @xmath0 decays to be seen as light hadrons  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis does not modify the previous analysis since the expressions for methods a and b [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : noopenc - a ] ) and ( [ eq : noopenc - b ] ) ] allow for @xmath38 transformations to light hadrons and only assume that singly produced charm decays weakly .",
    "how realistic is such a scenario ?",
    "the qcd corrected operator responsible for the @xmath8 transition can be written as ( neglecting the small conventional penguin contributions ) @xmath119 the estimate for the coefficient of the color - singlet term @xmath120 ranges from 0.10 to 0.25 and is much smaller than @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath38 quark pair is produced dominantly in a color - octet configuration .",
    "this means that the @xmath122 pair can annihilate into a single gluon .",
    "such effects , however , have already been included in the short - distance , perturbative calculations of @xmath50 . whatever may enhance the @xmath122 transformation into light hadrons should then be due to non - perturbative effects .",
    "one possibility is that light hadrons have a non - negligible @xmath122 component  @xcite .",
    "the part of the light hadron [ @xmath123 , etc . ] wavefunction that involves intrinsic charm will have maximal amplitude at minimal off - shellness and minimal invariant mass  @xcite .",
    "thus it maybe significant that the @xmath122 pairs produced in @xmath124 transitions favor low invariant masses ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "another candidate is a sizable production of @xmath125 hybrids ( denoted as @xmath126 )  @xcite where the @xmath122 pair is expected to be predominantly in a color - octet state .",
    "such hybrid states may couple strongly to the color - octet @xmath122 pair produced in @xmath12 decays governed by @xmath127 transitions .",
    "the masses of the lowest lying @xmath38-hybrid mesons are predicted to be above open charm threshold  @xcite .",
    "still , their widths are expected to be narrow because of selection rules that suppress the @xmath128 transitions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath129 processes are kinematically forbidden , except for the reduced production of the broad @xmath130 mesons with low invariant masses .",
    "thus , such hybrid mesons may be seen significantly as light hadrons . at present",
    ", there is no firm proof that this mechanism can account for the observed enhancement of @xmath36 .",
    "non - perturbative qcd effects , however , are rich and poorly known",
    ". we thus consider it important to investigate further theoretically and experimentally whether a significant portion of @xmath38 pairs produced in @xmath12 decays could be seen as light hadrons .",
    "the self consistency of inputs can be checked by taking the difference of the two methods which should equal zero : @xmath131 the cleo data are clearly self consistent , but the aleph data also are not inconsistent .",
    "equivalently , equating methods a and b , we obtain a relation among input parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath64 , @xmath23 , etc . among which @xmath23 is the only significant theoretical input ( other theoretical parameters are either reliable or small ) .",
    "this relation can be used to check the self consistency of the inputs , or to solve for one of the parameters in terms of all else . solving for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath23 , one obtains ( using cleo data only ) @xmath132 note that the above determination of @xmath23 uses experimental inputs only .",
    "the fact that these values are consistent with the input values themselves indicates that the inputs are self consistent .",
    "we will first discuss the systematics of each input , and then examine the correlations among them .",
    "could cleo have badly mismeasured the coefficient ( 0.876 @xmath134 0.037 ) of @xmath89 and/or the coefficient ( 0.1177 @xmath134 0.0093 ) of @xmath133 ( i.e. , apart from @xmath91 , see table i ) ? in order for the best estimate of @xmath3 no open charm ) ( method c ) to come down to the 5%  level , @xmath135 needs to increase by about 20% .",
    "that appears unlikely since then the charm multiplicity in @xmath0 decays as measured by cleo should be significantly different from recent aleph  @xcite and opal  @xcite measurements which are given in table iv .",
    "such a comparison is justified since the combined yields of @xmath136 in @xmath137-hadron decays at @xmath15 and @xmath138 factories are expected to agree within existing experimental errors .",
    "table iv shows the consistency of the measurements .",
    "also , method a is more sensitive to the change in @xmath89 and @xmath133 than method b , and increasing @xmath89 and @xmath133 by 20%   results in a 2-sigma discrepancy between the two methods evaluated at the nominal value of @xmath91 .",
    "we decided not to use the experimental @xmath74 data , and adopted a model prediction which gave branching fractions smaller than the experimental values .",
    "even if we were to double the total charmed baryon yield in @xmath0 meson decays , however , the result @xmath3 no open charm@xmath139 via method c would still be significantly larger than the traditional estimate .",
    "thus , our conclusion is not sensitive to the uncertainty in the charmed baryon yield .",
    "the wrong - sign / right - sign ratio of @xmath30 mesons , @xmath92 , still has large uncertainties .",
    "the method currently employed by cleo uses angular correlations between a high energy lepton and a @xmath30 meson to separate the cases where the @xmath30-lepton pair comes from the same @xmath12 meson or different @xmath12 mesons . at low @xmath30 momenta , however , the angular correlation is smeared out and it is difficult to distinguish the two cases .",
    "the aleph measurement fully reconstructs both charmed mesons from a single @xmath0 thus avoiding such systematics , but suffers from low statistics .",
    "@xmath15 factories should be able to determine @xmath92 more accurately by measuring the inclusive yield of @xmath30 s in @xmath137-enriched data samples that are optimally flavor - tagged .",
    "neither flavor - tagging nor @xmath140 mixing corrections would be necessary , if a large charged @xmath0 sample could be isolated .",
    "another possibility is that theory is unable to predict @xmath23 reliably .",
    "local quark - hadron duality may not hold .",
    "once local duality is assumed , the most important uncertainty lies in the choice of scale @xmath141 , as mentioned earlier  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates a troubling aspect of the calculation .",
    "contrary to expectation , there is no significant reduction in sensitivity on @xmath141 when going from leading - order to next - to - leading order .",
    "maybe @xmath23 has a significantly larger uncertainty than currently appreciated .",
    "it is gratifying to note that the recent measurements of wrong charm yields allow the experimental determination of @xmath23 , which agrees with theory .",
    "if the theoretical estimate of @xmath23 is not to be trusted , one has to rely on method a which does not depend on @xmath23 .",
    "note that the averaging used in method c reduces the sensitivity to the uncertainty in @xmath23 .",
    "figure 4 shows the hypothetical case of @xmath142 , which agrees with the central value of the aleph measurement [ eq.([eq : dbaraleph ] ) ] .",
    "the lines would cross at @xmath3 no open charm ) = 0.06 and @xmath91 = 0.032 .",
    "it demonstrates that increasing the wrong charm yield makes @xmath143 no open charm ) more consistent with the traditional estimate .",
    "the charm deficit would disappear due to the lower value of @xmath65 .",
    "thus if @xmath92 is measured to be around 0.2 with good accuracy , then one suspect would be a mismeasured @xmath65 .",
    "a more plausible culprit , however , would be a smaller @xmath23 than theoretically predicted , as discussed next .",
    "5 shows @xmath92 dependences of @xmath23 and @xmath3 no open charm ) ( method a ) both of which use experimental inputs only .",
    "if @xmath92 were small and around 0.05 , one sees that @xmath3 no open charm ) is @xmath144 which is within 1 sigma of the traditional estimate , and @xmath145 .",
    "the value of @xmath146 corresponds to @xmath147 .",
    "this set of parameters would be more or less consistent with the standard model without invoking new physics nor enhanced @xmath122 transformation into light hadrons . if on the other hand we take @xmath148 , one obtains @xmath149 , which disfavors small renormalization scales .",
    "these discussions clearly show the importance of accurate measurements of @xmath92 .",
    "newly available flavor - tagged data made it possible to apply complementary methods to estimate @xmath3 no open charm ) .",
    "comparisons of the methods allowed us to study correlations and self consistency of inputs .",
    "@xmath3 no open charm ) has been found to be much larger than generally accepted .",
    "the observation may indicate that non - perturbative effects cause an appreciable fraction of produced @xmath150 pairs in @xmath0 decays to be seen as light hadrons .",
    "a large @xmath3 no open charm ) could well be the final missing piece in the puzzle of the small charm multiplicity in @xmath0 decays and small @xmath151 .",
    "the proposed mechanism of annihilation of @xmath150 pairs could explain the low observed ratio of@xcite @xmath152 the numerator is governed essentially by @xmath153 transitions , where a sizable fraction of @xmath154 pairs may not be seen as open charm thereby reducing the charmed baryon yield . in contrast , the denominator is dominated by @xmath155 processes which would result in single open charm .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath156 transformation is also consistent with the observed significant surplus of @xmath157 in inclusive @xmath12 decays beyond conventional sources and the measured large @xmath158-flavor correlation with @xmath0-flavor at time of decay  @xcite .    one way to measure @xmath3 no open charm )",
    "could use a vertex detector which searches in a @xmath137-enriched sample for a @xmath137-decay vertex and vetoes on additional vertices from open charm .",
    "in addition , one could then search for a kaon attached to the vertex .",
    "if our predictions are confirmed , then many studies of rare @xmath0 decays and cp violation will have to be re - evaluated . through non - perturbative effects , amplitudes governed by @xmath159 transitions could have enhanced contributions governed by the combination of ckm matrix elements @xmath160 .",
    "this indicates that the rate of @xmath161 would be larger than that of @xmath162 which is consistent with a recent observation  @xcite .",
    "further , the penguin amplitude in @xmath163 processes may be enhanced such that direct cp violation may become observable either inclusively or exclusively , as in @xmath164 .",
    "also , the recently observed large value of @xmath165  @xcite and @xmath166  @xcite may be relevant in this context .",

    "<S> in recent studies of inclusive @xmath0 decays , it has been suggested that either @xmath0 mesons decay much more copiously to final states with no open charm than currently assumed , or @xmath1 has to be reduced significantly . </S>",

    "<S> this observation indicates that non - perturbative qcd effects are probably causing a sizable fraction of the @xmath8 transitions to be seen as charmless @xmath9 processes , contrary to smaller traditional expectations . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism has generally been overlooked and may explain the existing experimental data within the framework of the standard model . </S>",
