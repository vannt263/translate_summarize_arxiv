    "<S> this contribution presents the most recent mid - rapidity inclusive jet results from 3 @xmath0 of data collected from longitudinally polarized proton collisions at @xmath1 gev during the 2005 rhic run . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive jet asymmetry , @xmath2 , with it s increased transverse momentum range and precision , provides strong constraints on the gluon helicity distribution when compared with existing next - to - leading order perturbative qcd evaluations .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the partonic helicity distribution functions in the proton are essential for a complete understanding of the long range , non - perturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> three decades of polarized lepton - nucleon deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) experiments @xcite have shown that the probability for a quark spin to be aligned with the spin of the parent proton is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> conservation of angular momentum requires the quark ( @xmath4 ) and gluon ( @xmath5 ) total spin and orbital angular momentum ( @xmath6 + @xmath7 ) within the proton to sum to @xmath8 , motivating investigations into the size of the remaining components of the sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> traditional fixed - target dis experiments couple to the gluon distributions only at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , providing limited constraints on @xmath5@xcite@xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> several programs designed to directly access @xmath5 have been established and have produced initial results @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of higher statistical precision and broader @xmath9 reach continue to be recorded and released @xcite . during the 2005 rhic run star sampled 3 @xmath0 of proton collisions with an average longitudinal beam polarization of 50@xmath10 and @xmath1 gev . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive jet asymmetry measurement , spanning a transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) range of @xmath12 gev , represents the most precise measurement over the largest @xmath11 range to date .    </S>",
    "<S> the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) collaboration utilizes the polarized proton beam provided by the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) to study final state interactions resulting from quark - quark ( qq ) , quark - gluon ( qg ) and gluon - gluon ( gg ) scattering . </S>",
    "<S> star s </S>",
    "<S> large acceptance facilitates jet reconstruction , allowing for a nearly fragmentation independent reconstruction of the partonic characteristics inside the proton . the inclusive jet double spin asymmetry @xmath2 ,    @xmath13    is constructed from a ratio of the helicity aligned ( @xmath14 ) and anti - aligned ( @xmath15 ) luminosity normalized jet yields and </S>",
    "<S> is related at leading order to the product of the initial polarized ( @xmath16 ) and unpolarized ( @xmath17 ) parton distribution functions and partonic polarized ( @xmath18 ) and unpolarized ( @xmath19 ) cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between data and nlo perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions for the inclusive jet cross - section@xcite motivate the ultimate extraction of the gluon helicity distribution from these asymmetry measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the star detector systems @xcite relevant for jet reconstruction are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the barrel ( bemc ) and endcap ( eemc ) electromagnetic calorimeters . </S>",
    "<S> the tpc provides momentum information on charged particles scattered in the pseudorapidity region @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the bemc and eemc measure the neutral energy deposited per event in the range spanning @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum bias trigger ( minb ) was defined by a coincidence signal between east and west beam beam counters ( bbc ) @xcite , which are segmented scintillator detectors located on either side of the interaction region at @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> enhancement of jet reconstruction at high transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) was achieved by requiring a minb plus high tower ( ht ) or jet patch ( jp ) trigger to be fullfilled . </S>",
    "<S> the ht trigger required a single bemc tower ( @xmath23 ) to exceed a low / high threshold of 2.6/3.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the jp trigger , included for the first time in this analysis , required that a cluster of towers ( @xmath24 ) exceed the low / high threshold of 4.5/6.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> finally the bbc also serves as the star luminosity monitor , providing the spin dependent luminosity normalization for the asymmetry analysis .     the 2005 star mid - rapidity inclusive jet asymmetry calculated from from 3 @xmath0 of sampled data . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are statistical only with systematic errors represented by the gray shaded band as the bottom . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are nlo pqcd calculations@xcite depicting the inclusive jet asymmetry for various input @xmath5 distributions . , </S>",
    "<S> width=340,height=226 ]    the star jetfinder is based on the mid - point cone algorithm @xcite , which clusters tpc tracks and bemc tower energies greater than 0.2 gev into jets of radius @xmath25 , requiring a split / merge fraction of 0.5 and seed energy of 0.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> jet reconstruction is limited to the region of the bemc which was fully implemented and incorporated into the trigger during the 2005 run , resulting in the requirement that the jet axis lies at least 0.2 units in pseudorapidity from the detector edge @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> beam background , not associated with the hard scattering , results in an excess of neutral energy from the calorimeters to be clustered into the reconstructed jet . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - sample of jets dominated by this beam background are removed by requiring the neutral energy fraction of the jet be less than 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the jets were required to originate from a vertex of @xmath27 cm along the beamline .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ all ] shows the 2005 star inclusive jet @xmath2 as a function of the measured jet @xmath11 . although the ht and jp trigger rates were matched in bandwidth , the high threshold jp trigger jet reconstruction efficiency was on average @xmath28 greater than the ht , resulting in half of the final jet sample originating from the higher threshold jp trigger . in order to maintain a uniform trigger bias , </S>",
    "<S> each jet was required offline to contain a trigger tower ( ht ) or patch ( jp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the grey shaded band represents the systematic error , excluding the 25@xmath10 uncertainty on the beam polarization values . </S>",
    "<S> the leading contributions to the systematic error result from an estimate of the bias introduced to the asymmetries from the trigger and jet reconstruction requirements and a conservative upper limit on possible false asymmetries in the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> additional , less significant , systematic contributions arise from non - longitudinal beam components and the effect of beam background on the asymmetry and relative luminosity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> no significant bunch or fill dependent systematics were observed . </S>",
    "<S> the 2005 jet asymmetries are in good agreement with previous star inclusive jet measurements @xcite in the region of kinematic overlap .    </S>",
    "<S> confidence level comparisons between the 2005 star inclusive jet asymmetry measurement and nlo pqcd calculations for various gluon distributions within the grsv framework@xcite@xcite . the yellow shaded band represent the systematic error due to the beam polarization uncertainty.,height=264 ]    the curves in fig.[all ] are nlo pqcd calculations of inclusive jet asymmetries@xcite for several variations of @xmath5 at the input scale . </S>",
    "<S> the black curve ( standard ) incorporates the @xmath5 which gives a best fit to the dis data within the grsv formulation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the red ( green ) curves indicate scenarios where the gluons are completely ( anti-)aligned with the proton spin . </S>",
    "<S> the blue curve shows @xmath29 and therefore all non - zero values derive from the quark spins only . </S>",
    "<S> the jet asymmetries are clearly not consistent with the maximal polarization case , but are also not yet precise enough to distinguish between the minimal , standard and zero scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the measurement does allow , within the grsv framework , for the exclusion of several @xmath5 values between the standard and maximal case . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ cl ] quantifies this comparison by showing the confidence level at which this measurement rules out various input gluon distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the 2005 results rule out @xmath30 0.5 at @xmath31 level . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 range for the grsv standard gluon fit spanned @xmath33 to @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors and their correlations across @xmath11 bins are accounted for in the confidence level calculations , with the yellow shaded band representing the possible systematic shift due to the beam polarization uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 reach of this measurement translates into a sampling of @xmath35 of the total integral ( @xmath36 ) of the gluon helicity distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the star 2005 inclusive jet results provide a significant contribution to the global understanding of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> although the measurements presented here clearly place stronger constraints on the gluon distribution than the fixed target dis data , only their inclusion within a global analysis of world data will allow for a definitive extraction of @xmath5 . </S>"
