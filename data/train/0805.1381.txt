    "given a link @xmath5 , let @xmath2 denote the double - cover of @xmath1 branched along @xmath0 .",
    "this is a closed , oriented @xmath6-manifold , to which we can associate its heegaard floer homology group @xmath3 , defined by ozsvth and szab @xcite .",
    "when the determinant of @xmath0 is non - zero , @xmath2 is a rational homology sphere , and this invariant takes the form of an abelian group , graded by rational numbers , which decomposes according to @xmath7 structures on @xmath2 .",
    "closely related to this construction are two other invariants : the knot floer homology @xmath8 , defined by ozsvth and szab @xcite and by rasmussen @xcite ; and the khovanov homology @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both of these knot homology theories are abelian groups with an integer bigrading , one of which is commonly denoted by a @xmath4 in both theories .",
    "these invariants exhibit many similarities , and understanding their precise relationship is an area of active interest .",
    "for example , ozsvth and szab have constructed a spectral sequence from the reduced khovanov homology @xmath9 to @xmath10 , using @xmath11 coefficients @xcite .",
    "rasmussen observed an inequality of ranks @xmath12 for many knot types , and conjectured the existence of a spectral sequence between these groups to explain this phenomenon ( @xcite , section 5 ) .",
    "such a result would be particularly interesting since @xmath13 is known to distinguish the unknot @xcite , whereas the corresponding fact is unknown for @xmath14 .    both of the knot homology theories @xmath13 and @xmath14 possess _ spanning tree models _ as well .",
    "given a planar projection @xmath15 of a link @xmath0 , we can color its regions black and white in checkerboard fashion , and define a graph @xmath16 whose vertices correspond to the black regions and whose edges correspond to incidences between black regions at the crossings in @xmath15 .",
    "there is a standard construction of a doubly - pointed heegaard diagram for @xmath5 out of @xmath15 , and its corresponding floer chain complex @xmath17 is freely generated by spanning trees of @xmath16 @xcite . in a different direction , by performing reductions on the chain complex appearing in the definition of khovanov homology , champanerkar and kofman @xcite and wehrli @xcite have shown that the same is true for khovanov homology .",
    "these models are particularly economical in many cases .",
    "for example , when @xmath15 is a connected alternating diagram , the differentials on @xmath17 and @xmath18 vanish .",
    "moreover , this model remains useful in making calculations for small non - alternating knots , and for understanding pieces of @xmath13 for other families of knots @xcite .",
    "however , the differential on @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the spanning tree models remains a mystery in general .",
    "we note that the original construction of khovanov homology is algorithmically computable , and the same is now known for knot floer homology as well @xcite , although the complexes involved in these constructions typically have much larger rank than their homology groups .",
    "it remains a puzzle to describe a simple , algorithmic model for either theory @xmath13 or @xmath14 based on a chain complex generated by spanning trees .",
    "for the unknot @xmath0 .",
    "( b ) the doubly - pointed heegaard diagram presenting @xmath5 .",
    "( c ) the heegaard diagram presenting @xmath2 .",
    "the heegaard surfaces shown have genus five , and the five red @xmath19 curves encircle the holes in the surface .",
    "the blue @xmath20 curves appear thinner when they pass onto the bottom of the transparent heegaard surface . , title=\"fig:\",width=480 ] ( -270,320)(a ) ( -370,160)(b ) ( -170,160)(c )    the main result of this paper is a spanning tree model for @xmath3 which is similar in spirit to the spanning tree model for @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ f intro ] gives an example of the heegaard diagram involved .",
    "shown there is a diagram @xmath15 for the unknot @xmath0 , the associated doubly - pointed heegaard diagram for @xmath5 ( following @xcite ) , and a heegaard diagram for @xmath2 . comparing the two pictures , observe that the @xmath19 and @xmath20 curves and their intersection points can be put into one - to - one correspondence between the two heegaard diagrams , and that the top half of both diagrams are identical .",
    "the first observation indicates that both of the associated floer chain complexes have the same generating set , while the second is a bit more subtle , leading to a pair of spectral sequences which we examine in @xmath21[s specseq ] . this model for @xmath3",
    "suffers the same drawback as does the model for @xmath8 , in that it does not lead to an algorithmic calculation of the homology group .",
    "however , we can use it to make computations for many manifolds of interest , and it suggests the existence of a @xmath4-grading on @xmath3 analogous to the ones on @xmath13 and @xmath14 . + this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath21[s prelim ] we discuss some of the basic combinatorics of knot diagrams .",
    "in particular , we define the goeritz matrices and coloring matrix associated to a knot diagram , and we introduce kauffman states to encode spanning trees of the black graph . in @xmath21[s hds ] we construct two heegaard diagrams for @xmath2 out of a planar diagram @xmath15 of @xmath0 .",
    "the first of these , @xmath22 , arises out of the standard cut - and - paste description of @xmath2 .",
    "the second , @xmath23 , is the one alluded to already .",
    "it is constructed by resolving @xmath15 into a single unknotted curve with a collection of resolving arcs .",
    "the branched double - cover of the unknotted curve is @xmath1 , and the preimages of the resolving arcs gives rise to a simple framed link @xmath24 .",
    "surgery on @xmath25 produces @xmath2 , and by writing down a heegaard diagram subordinate to @xmath25 we obtain @xmath23 .",
    "this procedure is depicted in figure  [ f hdderivation ] . using this diagram",
    ", we give a quick proof that the branched double - cover of a non - split alternating link is an l - space .    in @xmath21[s absgradings ] we write down a simple formula for the grading and @xmath7 structure of a kauffman state @xmath26 ( theorem [ t grading ] ) , interpreted as a generator of @xmath27 .",
    "one of the terms in the grading formula is a quantity @xmath28 akin to the @xmath4-grading on @xmath13 and @xmath14 . after proving these formulas ,",
    "we show in @xmath21[ss alternating ] a simple way to compute the correction terms for @xmath2 when @xmath0 is a non - split alternating link ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 3.4 ) . in @xmath21[s domain ] we use the goeritz matrices , coloring matrix , and the results of @xmath21[ss regions ] to write down the domain of a homotopy class connecting a pair of generators ( theorem [ t domain ] ) .    in @xmath21[s specseq ] we revisit the similarity between the diagram @xmath23 and the standard doubly - pointed heegaard diagram for @xmath5 gotten from @xmath15 .",
    "we write down a pair of spectral sequences whose @xmath29 terms are freely generated by kauffman states , and which converge to @xmath3 and @xmath8 . moreover , the @xmath30 differential in both spectral sequences counts holomorphic disks whose domain is supported on top of the heegaard diagram , so the @xmath31 term in both sequences are the same . theorem [",
    "t e1 ] asserts that this group is freely generated by so - called _ solitary _ kauffman states of @xmath15 ( definition [ d solitary ] ) .",
    "we note that by construction the @xmath30 differential preserves the alexander grading in @xmath17 , and respects the decomposition of @xmath32 into @xmath7 structures . in @xmath21[s calculations ] we apply the spanning tree model of @xmath3 to make calculations for some knots with @xmath33 crossings .",
    "specifically , we apply it to those knots which are neither alternating nor montesinos knots , since the invariant for these knots can be computed by other means ( as in @xmath21[ss alternating ] and @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude in @xmath21[s speculation ] with some speculation .",
    "we focus on the term @xmath28 appearing in the grading formula theorem [ t grading ] and conjecture the existence of a natural @xmath4-grading on @xmath3 , analogous to the one on @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in support of this conjecture",
    "are some small calculations of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a rational homology sphere arising as the boundary of a negative definite plumbing on a tree . in these examples ,",
    "the differential in the spanning tree model behaves surprisingly nicely , and suggests an algorithmically computable model for @xmath34 .",
    "we also point out a strong similarity with work by nmethi @xcite , who has proposed an alternative algorithmically computable model for @xmath36 , which comes equipped with an additional integer grading reminiscent of our @xmath4 .",
    "+ we point out that heegaard diagrams presenting @xmath2 , and more general @xmath37-fold cyclic branched covers @xmath38 , have appeared in the work of grigsby @xcite and levine @xcite . in their work ,",
    "the approach is to begin with a doubly- or multiply - pointed heegaard diagram presenting @xmath5 , form the appropriate cyclic branched cover of the heegaard surface , and thereby obtain a heegaard diagram presenting the preimage of the link @xmath39 .",
    "this approach is particularly well - suited to the calculation of the knot floer homology @xmath40 . by contrast ,",
    "our constructions are specific to the case @xmath41 , and do not immediately present the preimage @xmath42 .",
    "another heegaard diagram for @xmath2 was described by manolescu ( @xcite , section 7 ) . in that setting ,",
    "the link @xmath0 is first presented as a plat closure .",
    "manolescu then shows how the set of generators used by bigelow @xcite to compute the jones polynomial @xmath43 can also be used as a generating set for both the seidel - smith `` symplectic khovanov cohomology '' @xmath44 @xcite and the floer homology @xmath45 .",
    "the triple use of the bigelow generators here bears a surface similarity to that of the spanning trees described above .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my advisor , zoltn szab , for his patience and guidance during this project .",

    "finally , in @xmath21[ss heegaardmoves ] we examine a sequence of heegaard moves relating the diagrams @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "note that it is unknown whether @xmath857 implies that @xmath0 is @xmath13-thin .",
    "this is immediate from the construction of the spectral sequences , theorem [ t e1 ] , and the inequalities @xmath858 and @xmath859 .    in the effort to find knots",
    "whose branched double - covers are l - spaces , it is an interesting problem to find examples of non - alternating knots satisfying the hypothesis of corollary [ c e1collapse ] .",
    "certainly there are non - alternating diagrams whose number of solitary kauffman states equals @xmath246 .",
    "for example , changing one crossing in the alternating diagram of the trefoil knot gives a diagram of the unknot , and for a suitable placement of the marker @xmath46 there will be a unique solitary kauffman state .",
    "however , a different placement of @xmath46 can result in a marked diagram with three solitary kauffman states .",
    "in this section we explain how to use the foregoing results to make calculations of @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is a link with non - zero determinant , and in particular carry this out for some knots with @xmath33 crossings .      in general",
    ", suppose that @xmath132 is a heegaard diagram presenting a rational homology sphere @xmath35 , and we wish to compute @xmath34 as the homology of the chain complex @xmath558 .",
    "one proceeds by enumerating the intersection points @xmath327 , calculating their associated @xmath7 structures , and ( in the case that @xmath132 fits into a heegaard triple subordinate to a link ) writing down their absolute gradings .",
    "the hard work is in determining the differential on @xmath558 . in general",
    "this depends on the choice of complex structure on the heegaard surface @xmath110 and a perturbation of the induced complex structure on @xmath726 .",
    "however , in small examples , one can often circumvent the difficult analysis of moduli spaces en route to the answer by applying a few simple ideas which we discuss below . for now , simply note that the holomorphicity condition restricts our attention to pairs of generators connected by a domain with non - negative coefficients .    for the case of interest , the above data can be determined in a completely algorithmic way .",
    "we start with a marked diagram @xmath15 of @xmath0 with its regions two - colored . from this",
    "we write down its coloring matrix and goeritz matrices , and enumerate its kauffman states .",
    "each kauffman state corresponds to a generator of @xmath27 , whose absolute grading and associated @xmath7 structure are determined by theorem [ t grading ] and @xmath21[ss spinc ] , respectively .",
    "theorem [ t domain ] enables us to determine the domain connecting a pair of generators , and in particular enables us to judge for which pairs the non - negativity condition is met .",
    "we wrote code in mathematica to do this ( cf . a related program by ciprian manolescu @xcite ) .",
    "to input a given example into the program , one begins with a marked diagram of a knot and enters in by hand the white and black graphs , the crossing incidence numbers @xmath587 , and the coloring matrix . in practice , this process is somewhat laborious , and ( at least in the hands of the author ) susceptible to careless errors which may take a while to detect and fix .",
    "therefore , it is sometimes preferable to make the calculation by another method .",
    "for example , for the case of an alternating knot , one knows that @xmath2 is an l - space ( cf .",
    "corollary [ c lspace ] ) , so what remains to calculate are its correction terms .",
    "this can be done as explained in @xmath860 ( indeed , calculations of this sort were carried out in @xcite and @xcite ) . for the case of a montesinos knot",
    ", @xmath2 can be realized as the boundary of a negative definite plumbing on a tree with one bad vertex , and the algorithm of @xcite enables a calculation of @xmath861 .",
    "all but twenty knots with @xmath33 crossings belong to one of these two types ( @xcite , table f.2 ) . for the remainder , we calculated @xmath3 using our program , making use of the minimum crossing diagram for @xmath0 from rolfsen s table ( @xcite , appendix c ) .",
    "when performing a calculation , it is extremely helpful to know in advance something about the structure of the answer .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is _ quasi - alternating _ , then @xmath2 is an l - space ( @xcite , definition 3.1 and proposition 3.3 ) , and if @xmath0 has braid index @xmath6 , then this is nearly so : @xmath3 is torsion - free , and it is monic in all but at most one @xmath7 structure @xcite .",
    "the following exceptional knots are quasi - alternating : @xmath862 , @xmath863 , and @xmath864 , @xmath865148 , 149 , 150 , 151 , 155 , 156 , 157 , 158 , 159 , 162 , 163 , 164 , 165@xmath866 . for @xmath862 and @xmath863",
    ", pictures are shown in ( @xcite , figure 10 ) ; for those of braid index 3 , this follows from ( @xcite , theorem 5.6 ) . for the remainder ,",
    "it is possible to find a crossing in the rolfsen diagram of @xmath0 for which the resolution @xmath867 is quasi - alternating , the resolution @xmath868 is a two - component alternating link , and @xmath869 .",
    "furthermore , we can argue that @xmath870 is an l - space , although we could not determine whether this knot is quasi - alternating .",
    "to see this , there is a crossing in its rolfsen diagram for which one resolution is @xmath871 and the other is @xmath872 .",
    "the knot @xmath871 is not quasi - alternating , but @xmath873 is an l - space ( one can show this either using the spanning tree model or the algorithm of @xcite ) , @xmath872 is a non - split alternating link , and @xmath874 .",
    "now the argument of @xcite , proposition 3.3 applies to show that @xmath870 is an l - space .",
    "in addition to the knots listed here with l - space branched double - covers , the knots @xmath875 and @xmath876 have braid index @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it is typically the case that we know in advance that @xmath877 is free and monic , and what remains to determine is the correction term @xmath534 in which this group is supported .",
    "suppose we are in this position in a particular example . if @xmath878 is supported in a pair of gradings for some particular @xmath7 structure @xmath532 , then @xmath879 for some @xmath880 and @xmath881 .",
    "in this case we can conclude from the euler characteristic that @xmath882 . alternatively , suppose that there is a unique solitary kauffman generator in a particular @xmath7 structure @xmath532 . in this case theorem [ t e1 ]",
    "implies that @xmath534 equals the grading of this generator .",
    "if @xmath878 does not have one of the two foregoing properties , it is possible that @xmath883 does , in which case we can invoke the conjugation symmetry @xmath884 .",
    "occasionally , neither @xmath878 nor @xmath883 has either property . in this case",
    ", we can still read off @xmath885 from the grading of any generator of one of these two groups .",
    "if @xmath886 implies that @xmath887 or @xmath888 , then we can try to change the position of the marked point @xmath46 to get a new marked diagram @xmath672 .",
    "having done so , we can locate the pair of subcomplexes @xmath889 and @xmath890 by the gradings of their generators @xmath891 , and see whether we can apply one of the preceding observations to one of the new complexes to determine @xmath534 .    for the eighteen knots enumerated above , these techniques suffice to determine @xmath534 every time we know that @xmath877 is monic . indeed , for many of these knots",
    ", @xmath246 is relatively close to the number of generators of @xmath27 , so that frequently @xmath878 consists of very few generators .",
    "in addition , for a suitable choice of marked point @xmath46 in the diagrams of @xmath875 and @xmath892 , and @xmath893 the @xmath894 structure on @xmath2 , the spectral sequence of @xmath21[s specseq ] which computes @xmath895 collapses at the @xmath31 term . thus we can easily calculate @xmath895 in these two cases as well , even though these groups are not monic .",
    "the two remaining knots @xmath896 and @xmath897 are more difficult to handle . for one thing ,",
    "@xmath898 , so in this case we wind up considering a chain complex with @xmath899 generators in a single @xmath7 structure .",
    "in addition , we have no a priori result asserting that @xmath3 is torsion - free for either of these knots , although this turns out to be the case .",
    "instead , we must analyze @xmath27 more closely , applying the foregoing techniques with some additional observations .",
    "for example , it is commonly the case that we have a pair of generators @xmath26 and @xmath423 for which @xmath900 and @xmath26 is not connected to any other generator by a non - negative domain .",
    "then @xmath901 , and @xmath902 implies that @xmath903 .",
    "this latter fact may not be so clear judging from domains of maps , as @xmath423 could be connected to some other generator @xmath292 by a non - negative domain @xmath324 . in any event",
    ", we learn that @xmath904 for any @xmath738 with @xmath792 .",
    "that is , if there is some other pair of generators @xmath905 and @xmath729 connected by this same domain @xmath324 , then we can conclude that @xmath906 does not involve any contribution from @xmath729 .",
    "one can run this sort of argument and close in on the answer by comparing what the different complexes @xmath27 reveal by moving the marked point around . as a final resort ,",
    "it is necessary on occasion to draw the domain connecting a pair of generators which is not counted by @xmath30 , recognize it as an arborescent punctured polygon , and apply lemma [ l polygonlemma ] . with a good deal of perseverance , these techniques enable the determination of @xmath3 , @xmath907 and @xmath897 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath3 for the twenty non - alternating , non - montesinos knots @xmath0 with @xmath33 crossings is reported as follows .",
    "we identify @xmath908 via @xmath909 , and when @xmath2 is an l - space , we record the element @xmath910.\\ ] ] we express an element of @xmath911 as a monomial @xmath912 or @xmath913 , depending on the number of generators of this group . in the four instances in which @xmath2 is not an l - space ,",
    "@xmath877 has rank one except in the @xmath894 structure @xmath893 , and @xmath895 takes the form @xmath914 , where @xmath915 . in this case",
    "we write @xmath916 thus , for example , @xmath917 .",
    "we briefly point out that these calculations can be used to determine @xmath861 from the algebraic fact that @xmath918 with @xmath919 implies that @xmath920 .",

    "when @xmath922 , we compare the coefficients on terms @xmath913 and @xmath923 instead .",
