    "in equilibrium systems power law distributions are observed at the criticality .",
    "many open and driven systems in nature , however , naturally self organize to produce scale free distributions@xcite .",
    "distribution of rain fall , magnitude of earthquake , link distribution of world wide web are few examples to mention .",
    "the scale invariant distributions are also seen in social and economic systems@xcite . about a century ago vilferdo pareto pointed out that wealth @xmath1 in any society is distributes as @xmath2 .",
    "several attempts have been made earlier to understand this phenomena , namely the pareto - law for the wealthy people@xcite .",
    "an interesting analogy has been drawn @xcite between the economic system and the system of ideal gases where particles and their energies are modelled as agent and their wealth , and redistribution of energy during collision is modelled as trading between agents .",
    "this analogy , which naturally generate gibb s distribution , could successfully explain 97% of the observed income distribution .",
    "the rich ( about 3% ) , however , follow a scale - free distribution which was explained later @xcite using ideal - gas like models . in this article",
    "we argue that economy works differently at different levels .",
    "in particular for rich and successful it is quite a different game .",
    "there are certain kind of occupations , for example the law , the medicine and the journalism , market pays individuals not according to their absolute performance , but according to their performance relative to others in the same occupation .",
    "the same is true in the sports , share and entertainment industries .",
    "these systems where _ `` winner plays an important role in the market '' _ may be named as celebrity markets ( cm)@xcite .",
    "how does a system ( or market ) generates a successful professional or celebrity ?",
    "of course , there are exceptionally brilliant and strategic individuals who play and controls the market . but often , strategy of players or agents in the market are not very different from each other . however , the distribution of their success or wealth is highly asymmetric with power law tails , where most become unsuccessful and only a few become successful . to understand this phenomena",
    "we introduce a simple model of @xmath0 agents in section [ themodel ] . in section [ evidence ] the theoretical results",
    "are compared in certain example systems belongs to this class , namely celebrity markets .",
    "finally the conclusion and some discussions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "let us take an unbiased sample of @xmath0 agents , labeled by @xmath3 , who invests equal amount in the market ( _ say _ , stock market ) .",
    "the net gain of the agents@xmath4 are taken to be integers for simplicity and set @xmath5 at time @xmath6 . in each time step @xmath7 a randomly chosen agent @xmath8 first decides with probability",
    "@xmath9 , if he wants to continue investing .",
    "with probability @xmath10 the agent become inactive forever . if active , the net gain of the agent @xmath11",
    "is increased by unity , with a probability @xmath12 . of course , @xmath13 are normalized such that total probability of all active agents is unity .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the growth rate of agents @xmath14 depends on the the instantaneous gain @xmath15 and that @xmath14 is an increasing function . because , if @xmath16 , agent @xmath8 can be considered strategically smarter ( who studies the market better ) than agent @xmath17 at time @xmath18 and thus @xmath19 .",
    "note that , there is no direct interection between agents .",
    "the only interaction comes from the fact that the growth rate is relative .",
    "thus our model is an ensemble of @xmath0 independent agents where wealth @xmath15 of an agent follows a discrete time dynamics @xmath20 where @xmath14 is an increasing function . depending on their asymptotic limits",
    ", increasing functions may be classified into two categories ; ( a ) when @xmath21 is @xmath22 and ( b ) @xmath21 is finite ( say , unity ) .",
    "it is obvious that for case ( a ) , the growth rate @xmath14 for the smartest agent , chosen stochastically by the process , is large compared to the rest and thus he predictively wins the market . in the second case , where @xmath14 is a marginally increasing function , probability of gaining an extra unit is comparable among agents , which mimics the cometition existing in real markets .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that the agents are strategically similar and thus choice ( b ) is more appropriate .    since agents are independent , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the probability that an agent gains @xmath15 unit of wealth .",
    "to gain @xmath15 units , one must go through the process @xmath25 , which occurs with rate @xmath26 respectively .",
    "thus the normalized probability is , @xmath27    the average gain @xmath28 is monotonically increases starting from @xmath29 . since maximum value of @xmath9 is @xmath30 ( when agents keep on investing indefinitely ) , the maximum average gain is @xmath31 . if @xmath32 , one can fix any arbitrary density by suitably choosing @xmath9 .",
    "but when @xmath31 is finite , say @xmath33 , it is impossible to have uniform macroscopic density @xmath34 .",
    "thus in this case , the extra gain @xmath35 would be owned only by one or few agents . in next section",
    "we will discuss about such a possibility , namely the condensation of wealth .",
    "let us take @xmath36 .",
    "then agents do not have a choice but to invest indefinitely .",
    "let us further impose an condition that the agents keep on investing until total gain becomes @xmath37 .",
    "now , the partition function of an ensemble of systems with total gain @xmath38 being conserved is then q_m = _",
    "w(k).[eq : ce ] one may consider ( [ eq : ce ] ) as a canonical partition function and clearly ( [ eq : gce ] ) represents the grand canonical partition function of this system with fugacity @xmath9 .    in this canonical ensemble",
    "one can choose the density @xmath39 arbitrarily large .",
    "when @xmath34 , with @xmath40 being finite , we have extra wealth @xmath35 which can not be distributed macroscopically . some agent(s ) would gain this macroscopic amount .",
    "it can be argued@xcite that in the thermodynamic limit , wealth would preferably go to one agent instead being distributed between few agents .    the possibility of having condensation ( or a _ super celebrity _ ) depends on the rate @xmath41 .",
    "first we need that @xmath42 is finite .",
    "since @xmath43 is analytic for @xmath44 , we must check whether @xmath45 is finite as @xmath46 .",
    "this series will converge , when ratio of successive terms decay more slowly than @xmath47 .",
    "thus asymptotically @xmath14 should increase faster than @xmath48 .",
    "it is evident from the taylor s series of @xmath49 that condensation would occur when @xmath50 .    to demonstrate the condensation ,",
    "let us make a simple choice w(m ) = m/(m+b)[eq : w]which is a marginally increasing function . in this case @xmath51 and thus condensation occurs for large density @xmath34 , if @xmath52 . to calculate @xmath40 , first note that q_m= [ eq : q ] thus , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and hence , @xmath55 .",
    "any other choice of rate where coefficient of @xmath56 in taylor s series of @xmath14 is @xmath57 is similar to ( [ eq : w ] ) except that @xmath40 is different from @xmath58 .",
    "thus we will continue further discussions with choice ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "distribution of wealth can be obtained from ( [ eq : q ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath59 .",
    "thus , up to a normalization constant @xmath60 , p(m ) = z^m q(m ) = z^m m^-b .",
    "[ eq : pareto ] note that @xmath24 is similar to observed economic distribution : an exponential distribution for small @xmath15 and a power - law in the tail .    from ( [ eq : pareto ] ) one can show that @xmath61 diverges for @xmath52 and thus , in this case condensation occurs for sufficiently large densities . since , many observed distributions follow pareto law @xmath62 with @xmath63 , condenseation of wealth is expected in these economic systems if per capita income ( i. e. , the density @xmath64 ) is very large .",
    "condensation in economic systems has been observed and modelled earlier@xcite .",
    "it was argued that the macroscopic accumulation may be viewed as existing corruptions in societies .",
    "here , we show that such a phenomena can occur naturally in cms .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , in many occupations , like the medicine the journalism , the share trading and in the entertainment industries like the sports and the film industries , _ `` winner takes all the market '' . _ in this section we would cite some examples which are close to the model discussed here .       in global stock game@xcite : ( a ) group of k-12 students ( total@xmath65 members , started in january , 2006 , starting wealth is $ 10,000 per student ) .",
    "( b ) group of @xmath66 members , started in january 2005 , starting wealth is $ 666666666 per person.,width=302 ]    let us take an hypothetical example where brokers invest the same amount of money in stock market .",
    "what would be the distribution of their net gain ?",
    "it is difficult to carry out such a controlled experiment where ( real ) money is involved .",
    "however a prototype experiment is an existing game , namely global stock game ( gsg)@xcite . when a group joins this game they get a fixed amount of _ gsg dollars _ to make transactions in the real stock market ( nse ) and individual nav is evaluated .",
    "if these money would have been real the player could have earned the nav .",
    "this game is usually played by ( a ) a group of school / college students as an learing exercise or ( b ) by a group of brokers to get experienced in thereal stock market without loosing money .",
    "we have collected data for both the groups .    _ group a : _ we have combined two group of k-12 students and calculated the percentage of gain @xmath15 . if probability of net gain @xmath67 , the probability of gaining more than @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "thus , from the plot of @xmath70 versus @xmath71 in log scale one can obtain @xmath72 .",
    "condensation is expected for @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", @xmath70 do not vanish for large @xmath71 and a correct fitting function is @xmath73 .",
    "in fact for group a ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gsg ] ) we find @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    _ group b : _ this a single group of @xmath66 members joined to win the contest _",
    "money666_. for this group we find ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gsg ] ) that @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "note the exponent @xmath72 is different for different groups . a possible reason for group @xmath80 to have @xmath52",
    "is that it consists of beginners , where some learners are smarter than others and play well enough to become the super celebrity .",
    "however group b consists of exparts ( probably ) and thus nobody gains exceptionally different from others , which explains the smaller value of @xmath72      another example is the score ( e. g. , run ) of cricketers in international cricket , a bat and ball sport played between two teams of eleven players each .",
    "readers unfamiliar with the game may look at _ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cricket _ for details . in this example , let us take two cricketers who started playing about the same time .",
    "obviously one who scores better gets selected for the next international match .",
    "thus , the rate of increase of score @xmath41 is an increasing function .",
    "again , the difference between rates of two cricketers already having huge runs is small and hence the choice ( [ eq : w])is reasonable .     countries having @xmath81 players ; ( test ) the test cricket which is played by @xmath82 countries with @xmath83 players .",
    "data is collected from _",
    "http://www.howstat.com_. , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "countries having @xmath81 players ; ( test ) the test cricket which is played by @xmath82 countries with @xmath83 players . data is collected from _",
    "http://www.howstat.com_. , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "we have collected life time score ( run ) of the international cricketers for both one day international ( odi ) and the test cricket .",
    "the calculated distribution of runs @xmath24 are plotted in log scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cricket ] ) .",
    "corresponding slopes are found to be @xmath84 for odi and @xmath85 for test . since @xmath86",
    ", we do not expect a super celebrity here .",
    "it means , we will never fine an exceptional cricketer ( both in odi and in test cricket ) who could score strikingly different from others .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a model a markets , where agents ( employees or players ) are rewarded according to their comparative performance .",
    "a player who is successful at present has a better probability of being successful in future .",
    "we show that this underlying mechanism `` success comes easily to people who are already successful '' generates a skew distribution even though the ability of players are marginally different from each other .",
    "the model successfully describes observation of wealth condensation in economic systems .",
    "it also predicts that , in cricket , a brilliant performance which is strikingly different from others , is not expected from any player .",
    "this model is general enough to describe different systems having different @xmath72",
    ". it would be nice to obtain data at different intermediate times so that from the evolution of the net gain one can calculate @xmath41 and thus @xmath72 directly .",
    "such studies would certainly justify the model better .",
    "there are many other systems which are test ground for cm model .",
    "one example is the distribution of citation of different papers ( not authors ) where a better cited article is expected to get more citations in future .",
    "another example is the distribution of chromosomal changes per tumor@xcite in different kinds of cancers which show a power - law . here ,",
    "the mechanism is the following .",
    "a cell having more aberrant chromosomes @xmath15 , would generate daughter cells with more aberrations compared to a cell having smaller @xmath15 .",
    "thus ( [ eq : w ] ) is a reasonable choice .",
    "it is worth noting that the cm model can be mapped to a well - known model in non - equilibrium studies namely zero range process ( zrp)@xcite . zrp is defined on a one dimensional periodic lattice with @xmath0 sites and @xmath38 particles initially distributed randomly among sites .",
    "the dynamics of the model is as follows .",
    "one particle is transfered from a randomly chosen site to it s rightward neighbour with a rate @xmath87 where @xmath15 is the number of particles in the departure site .",
    "it can be shown , that the steady state distribution of particles follow ( [ eq : q ] ) in canonical or ( [ eq : gce ] ) in grand canonical ensemble with @xmath88 the condensation criteria of cm model is identical to that of the zrp .",
