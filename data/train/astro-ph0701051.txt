    "one of the most important results in stellar populations research over the past decade or more has been the recognition that , at least for systems within the local group , the objects classified as dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies do not possess single old populations . instead they exhibit a variety of star formation histories .",
    "this diversity is best documented for the milky way galaxy s ( mwg ) ` classic ' dsph companions , i.e.  the well - studied objects as distinct from the numerous newly discovered , but as yet less well - studied , systems .",
    "for example , ursa minor is dominated by a single old stellar population but dsphs such as carina , fornax and leo  i have had complex star formation histories , and contain stars as young as @xmath01 gyr . extended star formation histories are also evident for the m31 de and dsph companions .    at present",
    "there is no definitive understanding of what drives these variations in star formation histories , though there are hints that environment , as represented by , for example , proximity to a luminous galaxy , and the type of that galaxy , plays a role .",
    "these hints include the well known morphology - density relation in which the majority ( but not all ! ) of the isolated dwarf galaxies in the local group are star - forming gas - rich dwarf irregulars , rather than des or dsphs , and that for the mwg and its classic dsph companions , there is a trend for the more distant systems to have more prominent intermediate - age populations . clearly , to understand more fully the role of environment , the next step is to investigate the stellar populations of des beyond the local group . in this contribution",
    "initial results are presented for des in the m81 group , an environment somewhat denser than that of the local group , and for early - type dwarfs in the sculptor group , a low density loose aggregation of galaxies strung out along the line - of - sight .",
    "the results are based on images taken with the acs instrument aboard hst under programs go-9884 and go-10503 .",
    "there are currently about a dozen known de / dsph members of the m81 group @xcite .",
    "two , f8d1 and bk  5n , were studied in detail by @xcite using deep hst / wfpc2 images , and deep hst / acs images have now been obtained for a further five objects : kar  61 , f6d1 , kar  64 , f12d1 and ddo  71 .",
    "these seven des cover a range of properties .",
    "for example , the projected distances from m81 vary between @xmath030kpc and @xmath0170kpc , and the absolute magnitudes range from m@xmath1 to m@xmath2 .",
    "the hst / acs images were reduced with stetson s daophot / allstar package @xcite and calibrated using the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "shows the resulting colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for f12d1 and kar  64 .",
    "the cmds for the other des are similar .    in these cmds the red giant branch ( rgb )",
    "tip is readily apparent at @xmath3 , as is the presence of numerous upper - agb stars at @xmath4 magnitudes above that of the rgb tip . less obvious in these cmds is a ` red clump ' of core helium burning stars seen near the limit of the data at @xmath5 ( m@xmath6 ) . given the low metallicities of the des ( see below ) , the presence of such a clump most likely indicates the existence of a population of stars with ages younger than the galactic globular clusters .",
    "however , to recover information of this nature , ` population modelling ' of the cmds , in which the observed data are compared to synthetic cmds generated for different star formation histories , needs to be undertaken .",
    "such comparisons require knowledge of completeness corrections and errors as a function of magnitude and location , and this in turn requires substantial artificial star tests which have not yet been completed .",
    "consequently , only results from the upper part of the cmds where the errors are small and the completeness corrections are negligible are presented .",
    "the distances were determined by constructing @xmath4-band luminosity functions ( lf ) and measuring @xmath7 , the @xmath4 magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ilf ] , which shows the @xmath4-band lf for f12d1 .",
    "application of a sobel edge - detection filter to the lf data results in a well determined value for @xmath7 . then using reddenings from @xcite and the calibration of @xmath7 from @xcite ( cf .",
    "* ) values for the distances then follow .",
    "the mean distance of the 7 des is 3.70 mpc , with a 1@xmath8 dispersion of only 140 kpc , consistent with that expected just from the uncertainties in the @xmath7 values .",
    "indeed the difference in distance modulus between the ` nearest ' and ` furthest ' galaxies is only @xmath9 mag , so that it is only at the @xmath10 level that all the dwarfs being at the same distance can be ruled out .",
    "the mean distance closely matches that of m81 , 3.63 mpc @xcite .",
    "clearly , the 7 des lie within the ` core ' of the m81 group , consistent with the morphology - density relation .",
    "once the distances to the des are known , estimates of the mean abundance can be derived from the mean colour of the rgb compared to the colours of standard galactic globular cluster giant branches ( cf .",
    "strictly , abundances derived in this way are lower limits on the actual mean abundance as , for fixed abundance , the rgb of a younger population is bluer . the effect is not large unless the bulk of the population is significantly younger ( @xmath11 @xmath06 gyr ) than the galactic globular clusters , which is unlikely to be the case here .    in fig .",
    "[ lzplt ] the mean abundances derived in this way are plotted against the absolute magnitudes of the systems .",
    "also shown are the data for the two cen  a group des studied by @xcite as well as similar data for the classic dsph companions to the milky way , and for de and dsph companions to m31 .",
    "the m81 group objects fall in with the local group systems , as do the cen  a group objects , outlining a well - defined relation .",
    "the existence of this well - defined relation indicates that the mass - metallicity relation for de galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment , though clearly additional systems in other environments need to be added to this relation before it can be claimed as ` universal ' .",
    "the relationship is usually explained in terms of supernova - driven gas loss within dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all seven m81 group des show populations of stars above the rgb tip in their cmds ( cf",
    ".  fig .",
    "[ m81_cmds ] ) .",
    "such stars are upper - agb stars of intermediate - age ( age @xmath12 gyr )",
    ". two characteristics of these upper - agb populations have been explored .",
    "the first is the mean luminosity of the three most luminous upper - agb stars in each de , @xmath13 .",
    "since the tip of the agb is more luminous for younger populations , this parameter is an indicator of the epoch of the most recent episode of significant star formation .",
    "second , the number of upper - agb stars has been compared to the number of rgb stars in a 0.3 mag interval just below the rgb tip .",
    "this parameter gives a first order indication of the relative importance of the intermediate - age population .",
    "based on the @xmath13 values , and using the calibration of upper - agb tip luminosity with age of @xcite , the inferred epochs of last significant star formation for the m81 group des vary from @xmath02.5 to @xmath08 gyr .",
    "the diversity in these values is similar to that seen in the local group , though apparently as yet there are no m81 group des",
    "whose youngest significant populations are as young as those seen in the mwg dsph companions fornax ( @xmath141 gyr ) or leo  i ( @xmath01 gyr ) .",
    "although the most distant from m81 system ( f8d1 ) is also the de with the most luminous upper - agb stars , there is no clear dependance of the @xmath13 values on distance from m81 , in contrast to the situation for the mwg classic dsph companions .",
    "there the inner systems ( r@xmath15 @xmath16 75 kpc ) , such as draco and ursa minor , lack upper - agb stars and so have @xmath13 values of order 3.6 , the rgb tip luminosity . on the other hand , the more distant systems such as fornax at @xmath0140 kpc and leo  i at @xmath0250 kpc have @xmath13 values of 5.0 and 4.9 , respectively , so that overall there is an apparent correlation between @xmath13 and r@xmath15 for the mwg classic dsph companions . this correlation is a manifestation of the suggestion originally by @xcite that the milky way galaxy has more strongly influenced its nearer neighbours compared to the more distant satellites .",
    "a comparable trend is much less obvious for the m31 dsph companions , though the only m31 dsph companion with an upper - agb population is amongst the most distant of the satellites ( cf .",
    "the situation for m81 is thus more similar to that for m31 than for the mwg .",
    "as regards the relative numbers of upper - agb stars compared to the number of rgb stars just below the tip , there are definite de - to - de variations .",
    "again there is no clear correlation of the upper - agb to rgb number ratio with distance from m81 , though the most distant from m81 de is once more the one with the highest value of this ratio .",
    "full population synthesis models are needed to infer the proper intermediate - age population fractions but application of simple models ( cf .",
    "* ) suggests that these fractions range from @xmath015% to perhaps @xmath050% .",
    "once again these values fall within those for mwg dsph companions which range from @xmath00% ( e.g.  draco , ursa minor ) to @xmath07080% ( leo  i ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sculptor group contains six early - type dwarf galaxies , once of which is the relatively luminous ( m@xmath17 ) ds0 galaxy ngc  59 that will not be discussed here . regarding the other five systems ( eso540 - 030 , eso540 - 032 , eso410 - 005 , eso294 - 010 and scl - de1 ) recent observations have detected neutral gas in four , with m@xmath18/l@xmath19 values between 0.08 and 0.18 in solar units @xcite .",
    "these systems may well be best regarded as ` transition objects ' rather than as de systems . the fifth galaxy , scl - de1 has m(hi ) @xmath14 10@xmath20 solar masses and m@xmath18/l@xmath19 @xmath14 0.04 in solar units @xcite .    in",
    "the past few months deep hst / acs observations of the five dwarfs have been obtained .",
    "the images will allow generation of cmds of similar quality to those for the m81 group des presented in the previous section .",
    "a first look at the data confirms that the five scl group dwarfs have a significant spread in distance : scl - de1 is the most distant , eso540 - 030 and eso540 - 032 are at similar intermediate distances , and eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 are the closest .",
    "all 5 systems appear to contain upper - agb stars , and there are apparent differences in the upper - agb populations from system to system .",
    "while the cmd data are far from fully analyzed , it is likely that the red clump / horizontal branch is reached in the two nearer systems .",
    "the intention is to search the datasets for rr lyrae variables to confirm the existence of a galactic globular cluster aged population in the two dwarfs .",
    "the above results must be considered preliminary as the initial cmds are not yet calibrated , nor has there been any attempt to correct them for field contamination or to remove spurious or poorly measured stars .",
    "one issue though can be investigated directly from the acs images .",
    "this the question of the existence of globular clusters associated with scl - de1 .",
    "@xcite identified three candidate globular clusters based on relatively short exposure hst / wfpc2 ` snapshot ' images .",
    "all three candidates are contained within the field of the acs images , which have better resolution and which go considerably deeper than the images available to @xcite .",
    "inspection of the images indicates that all three of the @xcite candidates are in fact background galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the acs images also clearly show that scl - de1 does possess at least one apparently genuine globular cluster candidate .",
    "the cluster candidate lies @xmath020@xmath21 or 420pc to the nw of the galaxy centre and is @xmath050pc in diameter .",
    "it should be possible to produce a cmd for the cluster candidate which can then be compared with that for the dwarf .",
    "the acs frames of the other dwarfs will also be surveyed for cluster candidates .",
    "while fully exploiting all the information contained in the deep cmds of des in the scl and m81 groups remains a task to be completed , it is clear that essentially all of the systems studied so far contain indications of extended star formation histories .",
    "stated in another way , it is becoming increasingly evident that des with stellar populations similar to that of the local group des ursa minor and tucana , which lack upper - agb stars and which have dominant old ( age @xmath22 10 gyr ) populations , are not very common .",
    "`` classic '' des , meaning objects consisting of a single ancient stellar population ( cf .",
    "baade pop ii ) are apparently comparatively rare objects .",
