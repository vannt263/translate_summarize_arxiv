    "one of the objectives of experiments with ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is to map the qcd phase diagram and study the properties of high density strongly interacting medium .",
    "the recent results obtained within lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) description of qcd thermodynamics at vanishing baryon density show that the phase transition from hadronic phase to quark - gluon plasma is a cross - over @xcite . from effective chiral models calculations @xcite as well as from the first lgt studies at finite baryon density @xcite",
    "one concludes that at finite chemical potential the cross - over transition is most likely to be converted to the first order .",
    "consequently , there might exist a critical end point ( cep ) on the qcd phase diagram as a matching point of first order and cross - over transition .",
    "based on the universal properties of the qcd chiral phase transition , one also expects , that the cep belongs to the 3-dimensional ising model universality class @xcite .",
    "this implies , that the cep is a particular point on the qcd phase diagram where the fluctuations of the net quark and electric charge densities are diverging @xcite .    in heavy ion phenomenology",
    "the fluctuations of conserved charges are directly accessible experimentally .",
    "thus , a non - monotonic behavior of such fluctuations in the c.m.s collision energy in heavy ion experiments would be an ideal and transparent signal of the existence of the cep @xcite .",
    "however , such conclusion is based on the assumption that the first order phase transition appears in equilibrium . in heavy ion collisions",
    ", we are dealing with quickly expanding dynamical system , such that , any deviation from equilibrium are not excluded .    a first - order phase transition is intimately linked with the existence of a convex anomaly in the thermodynamic pressure @xcite .",
    "there is an interval of energy density or baryon number density where the derivative of the pressure is positive .",
    "this anomalous behavior characterizes a region of instability in the temperature , t and baryon density , @xmath0 plane .",
    "this region is bounded by the spinodal lines , where the pressure derivative with respect to volume vanishes .",
    "the above anomalous properties of the first order transition can be uncovered in non - equilibrium system .    in this work",
    "we discuss a possible influence of the spinodal phase separation on the properties of baryon number density fluctuations .",
    "we show that spinodal instabilities result in divergence of electric charge @xmath1 and baryon densities @xmath2 fluctuations .",
    "consequently , a critical behavior of charge fluctuations is not only attributed to the cep but is also there along the first order transition if spinodal phase separation appears in a medium .",
    "our discussion will be based on the effective chiral model calculations , however our main conclusion on the properties of charge fluctuations in the presence of spinodal instability is quite general and is independent on the particular choice of the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "to study the properties of the chiral phase transition in the presence of spinodal instabilities we use as an effective chiral lagrangian the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model describes the interactions of quarks preserving the chiral symmetry of the massless qcd lagrangian . to consider thermodynamics we constrain the quark interactions only to the scalar and isoscalar sectors that are controlled by the phenomenological coupling @xmath3 . for two quark flavors , three colors and for finite quark chemical potentials",

    "this implies an instability of the baryon number fluctuations when crossing the transition between the chirally symmetric and broken phases .    the behavior of @xmath2 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a direct consequence of the thermodynamic relation @xmath31 which connects the pressure derivative with the susceptibilities . along the isothermal spinodal lines the pressure derivative in ( [ eq7 ] ) vanishes .",

    "furthermore , since the pressure derivative @xmath32 changes sign when crossing the spinodal line , there must be a corresponding sign change in @xmath2 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]-left .",
    "indeed , the negative specific heat in low energy nuclear collisions has been reported as the first experimental evidence for the liquid - gas phase transition  @xcite . due to the linear relation between @xmath2 , the isovector susceptibility @xmath33 and the charge susceptibility @xmath1  @xcite",
    ", the charge fluctuations are also divergent at the isothermal spinodal line .",
    "thus , in heavy - ion collisions , fluctuations of the baryon number and electric charge could show enhanced fluctuations , as a signal of the spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "the spinodal phase separation can also lead to fluctuations in strangeness @xcite and isospin densities .    in the case of an equilibrium first order phase transition",
    ", the density fluctuations do not diverge .",
    "the fluctuations increase as one approaches the cep along the first order transition and decrease again in the cross over region .",
    "this led to the prediction of a non - monotonous behavior of the fluctuations with increasing beam energy as a signal for the existence of a cep  @xcite .",
    "we stress that strictly speaking this is relevant only for the idealized situation where the first order phase transition takes place in equilibrium . in the more realistic non - equilibrium system",
    "one expects fluctuations in a larger region of the phase diagram , i.e. , over a broader range of beam energies , due to the spinodal instabilities @xcite .",
    "the singular behavior of the net quark number susceptibility at the cep and isothermal spinodals can be quantified by the corresponding critical exponents .",

    "is found to be @xmath37 , while @xmath38 at the cep in agreement with the mean - field results  @xcite .",
    "thus , the singularities at spinodals yield a somewhat stronger divergence as they join at the cep @xcite",
    ".    the mean field values of these critical exponents extracted from the numerical studies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] can be also derived analytically from the ginzburg - landau potential @xcite that is a good approximation of any effective chiral models in a vicinity of chiral phase transition .",

    "[ fig4 ] are renormalized when including quantum and thermal fluctuations , but the smooth evolution of the singularity from the spinodal lines to the cep , illustrated in fig .",

    "we have shown that the net quark number fluctuations diverge at the isothermal spinodal lines of the first order chiral phase transition .",
    "as the system crosses this line , it becomes unstable with respect to spinodal decomposition .",
    "the unstable region is in principle reachable in non - equilibrium systems , created e.g. in heavy ion collisions .",
