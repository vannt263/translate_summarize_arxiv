    "since topological concepts were first introduced to understand the behaviour of electrons in the quantum hall effect  @xcite , such ideas have become a powerful theme in condensed matter physics , applicable to a wide - range of different systems  @xcite . in topological materials",
    ", the eigenstates making up an electronic energy band can be characterised by nontrivial topological invariants , which are robust against any perturbations that do not close the energy band gaps .",
    "these invariants can be directly related to the existence of remarkable topological edge states localised near the system boundary , which lead , for example , to the robust and precise quantisation of conductance in the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "while the study of real materials is usually complicated , the essential physics of various topological phenomena can be captured through simple lattice models .",
    "perhaps the most famous of these is the harper - hofstadter ( hh ) model of a charged electron hopping on a 2d tight - binding square lattice in a uniform magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "not only does this model exhibit the quantum hall effect thanks to its topological energy bands and unidirectionally - propagating edge states , but it has a rich fractal energy spectrum known as the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "most importantly , this model has opened up the way for the study of quantum hall physics beyond traditional solid - state materials , beginning with its realisation in solid - state superlattice devices  @xcite , ultracold atomic gases  @xcite and silicon photonics  @xcite .",
    "recently , topological concepts have entered the realm of classical physics with specially - designed mechanical meta - materials @xcite and arrays of coupled classical harmonic oscillators such as pendula  @xcite , gyroscopes  @xcite and electrical circuits  @xcite . for many of these systems ,",
    "topological properties are encoded in the normal - mode dynamical matrix , in analogy with the electronic hamiltonian of a topological lattice model .",
    "the demonstration of topological edge states in these classical systems has also ignited the hope that such set - ups could find practical applications , for instance , as loss - free propagating acoustic waveguides  @xcite .",
    "in neutral systems , such as atoms , photons and classical oscillators , the simulation of topological phenomena has been made possible by important interdisciplinary developments in the creation of so - called synthetic gauge fields  @xcite . in the case of the hh model , the effect of the magnetic field on a charged electron is to modify the tight - binding tunnelling amplitudes by complex spatially - dependent phases called the peierls phases  @xcite .",
    "the route to simulating this model with a neutral system is therefore to find an alternative mechanism to generate suitable complex hopping phases . in ultracold gases ,",
    "this can be , for example , through the control of internal atomic states , by laser - assisted tunneling or lattice shaking  @xcite , while in photonics , this has been realised through the insertion of link resonators in ring - resonator arrays  @xcite or by twisting waveguides helically along the direction of light propagation to simulate a time - dependent modulation  @xcite . finally , in classical systems",
    ", analogous effects arise naturally for coupled gyroscopes  @xcite , with angular - momentum biasing  @xcite , or can be hard - wired into the coupling - connections in lattices of pendula  @xcite or electrical elements  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different conceptual approach for how to introduce non - trivial coupling phases , and hence how to simulate topological phenomena , in classical harmonic oscillator lattices through the application of temporally - periodic modulations to system parameters  . in this approach",
    ", we build on advances and methods from ultracold gases  @xcite and photonics  @xcite , where time - periodic modulations were previously introduced to realise topological lattice models . for classical harmonic oscillators ,",
    "the first steps in this direction were presented in  @xcite for the case of two coupled oscillators ; here , we develop these ideas further to propose a modulation scheme that simulates the analogue of the hh model in a large array of coupled oscillators . even though our discussion is focused on mechanical pendulum systems ,",
    "the same ideas straightforwardly extend to other types of oscillators such as lumped - element electric circuits of  @xcite .    as in the gyroscopic lattices of  @xcite ,",
    "our proposal breaks time - reversal symmetry and can be associated with energy bands describing the collective excitation modes of the coupled pendula system , which are characterised by a nontrivial chern number : the topological invariant of the quantum hall effect .",
    "we go beyond these previous works to show how , not only the edge states , but the hallmarks of the chern number itself could be seen experimentally in a system of classical harmonic oscillators . while these systems focus on the haldane model  @xcite , our scheme focuses on the hh model , where , thanks to the easy tunability of our synthetic flux , we show that the full hofstadter butterfly of states could also be observed .",
    "finally , we note that our proposal stands in contrast to the recent experiments on pendula  @xcite and electrical circuits  @xcite that did not break time - reversal symmetry , but instead realised two copies of the hh model with opposite synthetic flux : one copy for each of the two  pseudo - spin \" degrees of freedom defined in these systems . in the quantum analogy",
    ", this leads to the quantum spin hall effect in which the edge states are not topologically robust as they are unprotected against perturbations which flip the  pseudo - spin \" .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nem ] we introduce the system of coupled classical harmonic oscillators and highlight the limit in which newton s equations of motion are analogous to the heisenberg equations for a tight - binding model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hhm ] , we introduce the specific frequency modulation scheme from which we recover the hh model in the high frequency expansion of floquet theory . the efficiency of our idea is quantitatively assessed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] where numerical simulations of the full classical equations of motion , are compared to the predictions of the hh model .",
    "we find that the oscillation amplitude spectra exhibit wide peaks corresponding to the bulk energy bands ; we show that these peaks build up to give the hofstadter butterfly as a function of the synthetic magnetic flux .",

    "the expression for the effective coupling along @xmath9 is : @xmath214 where we have used the anger - jacobi expansion to obtain the bessel functions @xmath215 of @xmath216-th order with argument @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath156 and @xmath217 are defined as in eq .",
    "and eq .  .    the effective coupling along @xmath8 depends on the position along the static spatial modulation @xmath47",
    "we first focus on the couplings between pendula that have a natural - frequency difference of @xmath218 , where the @xmath219 indicates that the hopping is calculated going towards the left ( @xmath145 ) or towards the right ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "we have that : @xmath220 this equation describes the hopping along the small steps of the static spatial modulation .",
    "the coupling between pendula that have a natural - frequency difference of @xmath221 is : @xmath222 where this time @xmath223 indicates the hopping calculated going towards the left ( @xmath142 ) or towards the right ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "this is because the frequency - difference along the `` big step '' of the static modulation has an opposite sign to the ones along the `` small steps '' .",
    "finally , the effective driving force : @xmath224    we now assume that @xmath225 , with @xmath226 and take only the largest term in the sums . in eq .  , , and we have that @xmath227 , while in eq .",
    "we must take @xmath228 .",
    "remarkably , in this approximation , the hopping along @xmath8 is uniform and does not depend on the position along the static - spatial modulation , thus allowing for clear definitions of @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 : @xmath232    by combining eq .   with the effective equations of motion in eq .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath156 and @xmath49 , we obtain exactly the equations in eq .  .    from eq",
    ".  , and we notice that the second largest term in the sums is proportional to @xmath233 , that is very small if @xmath234 or when considering a large period of the static modulation @xmath235 .",
    "we found that an optimal combination of these two requirements that fulfils the inequality eq .   with the renormalisation of eq .",
    "is to have @xmath103 with @xmath42 .",
    "we now comment on the fourier decomposition that was used as an alternative method to the full - time integration with runge - kutta for solving the set of differential equations in eq .   to produce the butterfly spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : butterfly ] .    from the properties of periodically driven systems @xcite , we know that , during a floquet evolution between two stroboscopic times @xmath236 , the system exhibits micro - motion , with a period set by the frequency of the temporal modulation @xmath44 .",
    "we are interested in the steady state , therefore , we search for a solution of eq .",
    "that oscillates at the frequency of the external driving @xmath25 . to this end , we expand the @xmath237 in a fourier series , using both @xmath25 and @xmath44 as harmonics : @xmath238 where @xmath239 are the time - independent fourier amplitudes , assuming that all the time - dependencies are in the exponential term . the sum over @xmath240",
    "is truncated to a finite number @xmath123 , that is large enough to ensure a convergent solution .",
    "the sum over @xmath241 takes only two values @xmath242 , since we have assumed that the external driving force is a cosine with a defined frequency @xmath25 . by substituting eq .   in eq .   and",
    "isolating the component proportional to @xmath243 , we have a set of linear algebraic equations that can be inverted to find the coefficients @xmath239 .    in order to simulate the real experimental situation",
    ", we performed all the calculations using the full numerical integral of eq .  , except for hofstadter butterfly where the full numerical integration would have been computationally demanding .",
    "we have verified the good agreement between the two methods finding a mean error that is less than @xmath244 .",
    "we note that the two methods are in fact equivalent when the system is dynamically stable .",
    "however , when there is an instability , the system does not reach the steady state .",
    "this is clearly seen in the full numerical integration method , where the solution shows the typical exponential growth of an unstable system . in the fourier method the steady state",
    "is imposed by the decomposition eq .",

    "<S> we theoretically propose how to observe topological effects in a generic classical system of coupled harmonic oscillators , such as classical pendula or lumped - element electric circuits , whose oscillation frequency is modulated fast in time . making use of floquet theory in the high frequency limit , we identify a regime in which the system is accurately described by a harper - hofstadter model where the synthetic magnetic field can be externally tuned via the phase of the frequency - modulation of the different oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate how the topologically - protected chiral edge states , as well as the hofstadter butterfly of bulk bands , can be observed in the driven - dissipative steady state under a monochromatic drive . in analogy with the integer quantum hall effect , we show how the topological chern numbers of the bands can be extracted from the mean transverse shift of the steady - state oscillation amplitude distribution . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the regime where the analogy with the harper - hofstadter model breaks down . </S>"
