    "by probing the thermal response at timescales and lengthscales on the order of the phonon relaxation times and free paths , respectively , thermal spectroscopy provides a potentially powerful means of extracting information about these intrinsic transport properties of real materials @xcite . as a result",
    ", thermal spectroscopy has recently received a lot of attention for applications related to the development of thermoelectric materials @xcite .",
    "the success of this technique relies on reliably extracting the information embedded in the material response , an inverse problem of considerable complexity that currently remains open . in order to use precise language , in this paper",
    "we focus on time - domain thermoreflectance .",
    "we believe that the methodology proposed in this paper can be straightforwardly extended to complementary approaches based on frequency - domain thermoreflectance @xcite .",
    "traditional approaches to time - domain thermoreflectance data analysis start by matching ( in a least - squares - fit sense ) the experimental response to numerical solutions of the heat conduction equation with the thermal conductivity treated as an adjustable ,  effective \" , quantity @xcite .",
    "the free path distribution is subsequently extracted by assuming that the fitted effective thermal conductivity is given by the convolution of the differential free path distribution in the material with a suppression function that is assumed to be geometry dependent @xcite .",
    "an approximate suppression function has been developed for the thermal grating geometry @xcite ; suppression functions for other , more complex , geometries have yet to be developed .",
    "robust optimization frameworks for inverting the resulting integral equations have also been developed @xcite .",
    "however , since , by design , the material response in the experiment is not in the traditional fourier regime  defined by characteristic timescales and lengthscales being much longer than the phonon mean free time and mean free path , respectively  approaches based on fitting the material response using fourier theory can only be accepted as approximate . as shown in section [ discussion ] , the requirement of long times is particularly difficult to satisfy even if lengthscale corrections are applied . in general , in situations where the requirements for fourier behavior are not carefully met , the effective thermal conductivity obtained by such fits will depend on the fitting time window , the measurement location @xcite , and the experimental geometry , highlighting the fact that it is not a material property and casting doubt over the reliability of the inverse calculation .    to avoid these conceptual but also practical problems , in the present work ,",
    "we propose a methodology for reconstructing the relaxation time distribution in the material from thermal spectroscopy experimental results using an approach that at no time makes an assumption of an underlying fourier behavior . in our work ,",
    "the reconstruction problem is formulated as a non - convex optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the difference between the experimental material response and the response as calculated by a bte - based model of the experimental process . here",
    ", we note the recent paper @xcite in which reconstruction is based on a fourier - space solution of a bte model of the two - dimensional transient thermal grating experiment . despite emphasizing the bte more than in previous approaches",
    ", the work in @xcite , ultimately , still reverts to a fourier - based formulation by fitting effective thermal diffusivities and introducing related approximations ( e.g. late times compared to the mean phonon relaxation time ) .    a further distinguishing feature of our work is the use of deviational monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite as a method to solve the bte which expands the domain of applicability of the approach , since it does not rely on the simplicity of the experimental setup or the degree to which it is amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formulation ] , we formulate the reconstruction as an optimization problem requiring only solutions of the bte and present the optimization framework used for the reconstruction . in section [ application / validation ] , we discuss the implementation of the proposed method in the context of an archetypal experimental setup , namely that of a transient thermal grating @xcite . in the same section ,",
    "we validate our proposed method using synthetic data generated through monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we provide some comparison to effective thermal conductivity approaches and a discussion on the validity of the latter . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we provide a summary of our work and suggestions for future improvement .",
    "given the small temperature differences usually associated with thermal spectroscopy experiments , here we consider the linearized bte @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the deviational energy distribution , @xmath3 is the phonon frequency , @xmath4 is the phonon traveling direction , @xmath5 is the occupation number of phonon modes , @xmath6 is the phonon group velocity , @xmath0 is the frequency - dependent relaxation time and @xmath7 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "here and in what follows , we use @xmath3 to denote the dependence on both frequency and polarization .",
    "the above equation is linearized about the equilibrium temperature @xmath8 , to be understood here as the experimental reference temperature . in general , @xmath9 ; however , as a result of the linearization , @xmath10 ; in other words , the solutions ( and associated reconstruction ) are valid for the experiment baseline temperature @xmath8 .",

    "our goal is to obtain an accurate and reliable approximation to the function @xmath29 from the experimental measurements , with the latter typically in the form of a temperature ( relaxation ) profile .",
    "reconstruction of the free path distribution follows from relationship ; in other words , the group velocities @xmath30 are assumed known , since they can be reliably calculated either experimentally @xcite by means of raman spectroscopy , x - ray scattering , etc , or theoretically @xcite using methods such as density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we propose the use of an optimization framework in which the experimental measurements provide targets that need to be reproduced by the bte solution ; in other words , @xmath29 is determined as the function that optimizes ( minimizes ) the discrepancy between the experimental result and the bte prediction for the same quantity .",
    "one important consideration is use of a suitable discrete representation for @xmath29 . in our formulation",

    "although extensions of fourier approaches are sometimes possible ( e.g. see @xcite for the role of boundaries ) , these are not always guaranteed to exist or be tractable and their range of validity can not be expected to extend to @xmath240 , except fortuitously .    with the above considered , for the ttg case , the effective thermal conductivity construction and associated solution is only strictly theoretically justified in the limit @xmath220 . in some cases",
    "this coincides with the range in which experiments operate @xcite , in which case reconstruction using a diffusive approximation may be acceptable provided :    * the correct asymptotic relation ( i.e. equation ) is used * some loss of accuracy outside the range over which experimental data is available is acceptable    we also point out that the validation in @xcite featured wavelengths satisfying @xmath220 . in general , however , the requirements @xmath220 and @xmath203 are very restrictive , especially when considering that typical pump - probe response time is on the order of a few nanoseconds @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the method proposed here introduces no lengthscale or timescale restriction ; moreover , if input data is available over a limited range of wavelengths , the quality of the reconstruction does not suffer significantly .",
    "by analyzing the ttg response in detail we have shown that , as expected , reconstruction using the effective thermal conductivity concept is limited to late ( compared to the mean free time ) times and large ( compared to the mean free path ) lengthscales ( @xmath220 for the ttg in particular ) .",
    "using input data that does not satisfy these requirements will lead to reconstruction error ; on the other hand , using data in a limited range of characteristic lengthscales also leads to reconstruction error @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have proposed an alternative approach to the reconstruction problem that avoids the limitations associated with the effective thermal conductivity approach .",
    "the proposed method assumes knowledge of the phonon group velocities and poses the reconstruction as an optimization problem seeking the function @xmath29 that minimizes the discrepancy between the observed experimental data and the solution of the bte as applied to the experimental process .",
    "although much research and improvements remain to be made , one of the main contributions of the present paper is to show that reconstruction based on a more rigorous foundation ( which does not make use of the assumption of fourier behavior ) is possible .",
    "the proposed formulation is sufficiently general to accept solutions of the bte obtained by any means .",
    "in fact , we envision applications to problems including interfaces between materials @xcite ( and where the reconstruction will include inference of interface properties ) as direct extensions of the present work",
    ".    the optimization process is achieved by the nelder - mead algorithm that does not require gradient calculation and is thus robust to noise .",
    "our results verify that reconstruction is robust both in the presence of noise in the input ( experimental ) data and the bte solutions when the latter are obtained by mc simulation .",
    "although mc simulations are considerably more expensive , they are , in fact , the more relevant to applications of practical interest ( e.g. @xcite ) which are in general high - dimensional and not expected to lend themselves to analytical solutions . the cost of mc simulations is partially mitigated by their excellent parallel efficiency . moreover , in cases where the experimental measurement is limited to one ( or a few ) discrete spatial locations , the mc simulation cost can be made independent of dimensionality using techniques such as adjoint formulations .",
    "our validation tests started from multiple distinct initial conditions thus subjecting the optimization process to a worst - case scenario , since in most cases some a - priori information on the nature of the solution is expected to exist . in the present case , the lack of prior information was overcome by starting the optimization process , as a first stage , from a sweep of different initial conditions and choosing the result with the lowest objective function value as the initial condition for a second optimization stage . in the case of mc simulations , this approach was possible due to the robustness of the nm algorithm to noise , which enabled us to perform the first two stages of calculations using very cheap ( noisy ) simulations .",
    "in general , a - priori information could be very useful in ensuring convergence to the correct solution , which due to the highly non - convex nature of the minimization problem is not guaranteed .",
    "future research will focus on formulations which exploit a - priori information on the nature of the solution as well as alternative optimization algorithms to improve convergence rates and accuracy .",
    "our results also show that the reconstruction process is very robust with respect to the time window over which the material response is observed , in contrast to fourier - based approaches which assume a late - time response .",
    "more specifically , by matching the material response to bte solutions , the reconstruction is successful with response data limited to very early times ( e.g. on the order of 5 nanoseconds ) that are typical in pump - probe experiments @xcite but do not satisfy assumptions required for diffusive behavior to set in .",
