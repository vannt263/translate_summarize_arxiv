    "it is widely accepted that high - mass stars ( @xmath1 ) form in clusters . however , identification of cluster members is complicated because zero - age main - sequence stars and high - mass protostars are deeply embedded in their molecular surroundings .",
    "it is hence impossible to use a simple sed classification analogous to that applied to low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) . in this context , ultracompact ( uc ) ( @xmath2 pc )  regions and hot cores ( hcs ) play a fundamental role ( e.g. , kurtz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the former are very young  regions ionized by an o - b star which is embedded in the natal cloud .",
    "the latter are dense , hot , compact molecular cores which host even younger ( proto)stars , although their life time has not been established .",
    "a comparison between the estimated number of uc  regions in the galaxy and the o - b star formation rate yields a duration for the ultracompact phase of @xmath3 years ( wood & churchwell 1989 [ hereafter wc89 ] ) which is two orders of magnitude larger than expected from the classical expansion model for  regions ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain this discrepancy ( e.g. , akeson & carlstrom 1996 , and references therein ) . clearly , one must have better knowledge of properties of clusters to which hcs and uc  regions belong and of their natal molecular clumps .    a well - studied example of high - mass ( proto)star cluster is w49n ( at a distance of 11.4  kpc ) .",
    "subsequent to the identification of 12 uc  regions powered by o stars ( de pree et al .",
    "2000 ) , wilner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) identified 6 hcs from an unbiased survey of line and 1.4-mm continuum emission .",
    "using the hc to uc  region number ratio , they obtained an estimate of 25100% for the lifetime ratio between the hc and uc  region phases .",
    "however , the w49n study has an important limitation that the region is very distant which sets limits on the census of detectable ysos .",
    "the high - mass star forming region g19.610.23 is an excellent target for a study of cluster formation because of its distance ( @xmath4 kpc ; churchwell , walmsley , & cesaroni 1990 ) , and potential richness in terms of ysos as indicated by studies at cm ( e.g. , garay , reid , & moran 1985 [ hereafter grm85 ] ; wc89 ; garay et al .",
    "1998 ; forster & caswell 2000 ) and mid - infrared ( mir ) ( de buizer et al .",
    "2003 ) wavelengths . in this letter",
    ", we present a study of the cm continuum emission with higher sensitivity and better angular resolution , complemented by mm wavelength observations .",
    "aperture synthesis observations at 3  mm were carried out using owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array and nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) with a total of 6 array configurations in the period from 2002 december till 2004 april .",
    "more than 15 molecular lines ( r. furuya et al . in preparation ) were observed simultaneously with the continuum emission at 89.9  ghz .",
    "the flux density of the calibrator was bootstrapped from planets with an uncertainty of 15% . combining the continuum data from both arrays , we obtain a synthesized beam of 152 @xmath5 151 , and an rms noise level of 2.8  mjy  beam@xmath6 .    on 2003",
    "july 29 , we used the simba bolometer array on the sest 15-m telescope to obtain a parsec - scale map ( @xmath7 in size ) of 1.2  mm continuum emission . observing @xmath8 carinae and uranus",
    ", we checked pointing accuracy ( rms @xmath9 ) , and made flux calibrations .",
    "we retrieved 3.5   and 2  cm data from the archive of the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the 3.5  cm data were taken from projects aw374a and ak470 ( a - array ) , ak470 ( b ) , ak423 ( cnb ) , and ak450 ( d ) , and the 2  cm data from aw158 ( b and c ) , ak423 ( cnb ) .",
    "resulting beam sizes and noise levels are 033@xmath5023 and 055@xmath5050 with 0.31 and 1.7 mjy  at 3.5 and 2  cm , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : simba ] presents the simba 1.2  mm continuum emission map where two clumps separated by @xmath075  ( i.e. 1.3 pc ) are seen over a region of @xmath10 pc@xmath51.7  pc .",
    "the brighter clump to the west hosts the g19.610.23 complex . a total flux density ( ) of 19.4 jy",
    "is obtained by integrating the emission inside the 3@xmath11 contour level .",
    "figure [ fig:3mmx]a shows the vla image of the 3.5  cm continuum emission toward the center of the western clump , where a cometary shaped and several compact  regions , surrounded by a 0.1-pc halo , are seen .    since the minimum projected baseline lengths ( 0.78 , 7.7 , and 2.8  for the 3.5 , 2  cm , and 3  mm data , respectively ) and beam sizes ( @xmath12 ) are not identical , we reconstructed all the interferometric images with a 15 beam using visibilities with a _ uv_-radius greater than 7.7 k@xmath13 .",
    "this makes our images insensitive to structures more extended than 27  ( i.e. 0.46 pc ) .",
    "thus only the 0.1-pc halo common to all of the cluster members is resolved out .",
    "figure [ fig:3mmx]b represents an overlay of such maps at 3.5 , 2  cm and 3  mm .",
    "most of the 3  mm peaks are associated with previously identified cm sources ( grm85 ; wc89 ; garay et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggesting that our 3  mm map is sensitive to both free - free emission from ionized gas inside the compact  regions and thermal emission from dust grains in the surrounding cores . to establish the properties of the dust continuum emission , we need to remove the free - free emission from the 3  mm map .",
    "we produced a `` pure '' free - free emission image at 3  mm by extrapolating the 3.5  cm map assuming optically thin emission ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "then we subtracted this from the 3  mm continuum image , thus obtaining a `` pure '' dust emission map ( see figure [ fig:3mmx]c ) .",
    "taking into account the calibration errors at the various wavelengths , we estimate a subtraction uncertainty of 4.3 mjy .",
    "the resulting map presents a strong ( @xmath15 ) peak lying between the uc  regions labeled a and c ( see the yellow cross in figure [ fig:3mmx]a ) , where no emission peak is seen in 2 and 3.5  cm images . instead , the 3  mm peak coincides with a molecular core ( figure [ fig:3mmx]d ) detected in the  ( 1110 ) and so@xmath16 ( 8@xmath17 ) lines : these molecular species are typical tracers of hcs ( van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) .",
    "the core is also traced by other molecules such as  ( garay et al .",
    "1998 ) ,  ( kurtz et al . 2000 ) , hcooch@xmath18 , , hn@xmath19c , , and so ( r. furuya et al . in preparation ) .",
    "such a richness in molecular species makes this core very similar to orion - kl ( wright , plambeck , & wilner 1996 ) and other hcs ( kurtz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of  ( hofner & churchwell 1996 ) and oh ( grm85 ) masers strongly suggest that the ( proto)star deeply embedded in the core is too young to ionize its surrounding material because masers are believed to disappear during the development of an uc  region . no other prominent `` dust '' condensation was detected above a 5@xmath11 upper limit of 21.5  mjy , although extended emission is seen towards some of the  regions .",
    "such an upper limit corresponds to a sensitivity in gas plus dust mass of 27  for a typical hc temperature of 100  k ( kurtz et al .",
    "2000 ) . the large majority ( @xmath085% ) of the hcs known to date ( e.g. table  1 of kurtz et al .",
    "2000 ) are above this limit , but we can not rule out the possibility to have missed the least massive ones ( @xmath010  @xmath20 ) .    we have identified the uc  regions in the cluster with a procedure , which iteratively fitted and subtracted prominent emission peaks from the cm maps , until the signal in the residual image was below 5@xmath11 .",
    "the borders of the cometary shaped uc  region a and the source j at 2 cm were identified as the 5@xmath11 contour levels enclosing them , whereas for all the other uc  regions a 2-d gaussian fit was used .",
    "this gave us the peak position , , and deconvolved source diameter of the sources .",
    "in the estimate of the error on , we considered the formal error of the fit , the flux calibration uncertainty , and the contribution due to the noise in the map . in this way , we identified 9 uc  regions , labeled a  d , f , g , i , j , and k. all of these were identified both at 3.5 and 2  cm , with the sole exception of j , too faint to be detected in the 2  cm image .    in order to derive the properties of the uc  regions at 3  mm ,",
    "it was necessary to disentangle the hc from uc  regions a and c. for this purpose , we used the free - free subtracted map at 3  mm ( figure [ fig:3mmx]c ) to fit the hc with a 2-d gaussian .",
    "then this gaussian model was subtracted from the original 3  mm image .",
    "the resulting `` clean '' image was treated in the same way as the 3.5 and 2  cm maps to identify the counterparts of the cm sources .",
    "because of the difficulty to define unique area for object f at 3  mm , we estimate an uncertainty equal to the difference between the flux estimate obtained from gaussian fitting and that from integrating the emission inside the 5@xmath11 contour . in figures [ fig:3mmx]b and c , one can see that an isolated 3  mm source lies to the east of a : we assume that this emission is associated with the tail of the cometary uc  region a rather than to a distinct yso .",
    "we thus identified 6 objects at 3  mm , including the hc , above a detection threshold of 5@xmath11 . in conclusion , we have identified a total of 10 high - mass ysos :   1 hc and 9 uc  regions ( table [ tbl : source ] ) .",
    "note that we detected all the radio sources previously identified by other authors , except source e of wc89 .",
    "all 9 uc  regions have been detected at more than 2 bands at cm wavelengths , if one takes into account identifications reported in the literature .",
    "we analyzed the continuum spectra of the whole region and of each cluster member by modeling the emission as originating from a dust - free  region surrounded by a dusty molecular shell .",
    "spherical symmetry and homogeneity are assumed for both the  region and the shell .",
    "the spectrum of the whole region is shown in figure  106 of wc89 . to the data reported in this figure",
    "we have added our fluxes at 3   and 1.2  mm ( @xmath21 ) , and that at 350 @xmath22 m by mueller et al .",
    "most of the 3  mm emission is due to free - free , while the emission shortward of 1.2  mm is originating from dust .",
    "given the complexity of the region seen in free - free emission , we estimate only a pc - scale mean dust temperature ( ) and a total mass of the gas plus dust ( ) .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the  region was considered only to subtract the free - free component from the spectrum .",
    "we adopted a dust absorption coefficient @xmath23 with @xmath24=0.005  @xmath25  g@xmath6 at @xmath26=230  ghz ( preibish et al .",
    "1993 ) and @xmath27=1.5 .",
    "we obtain @xmath2842  k , and @xmath282800@xmath29100  @xmath30 , which are very similar to the values of other clumps containing high - mass ysos ( e.g. fontani et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "subsequently we have analyzed the continuum spectra of the 10 sources in the cluster using the above model . in the fits we fixed radii of  regions ( @xmath31 ) and dusty shells ( @xmath32 ) to the values",
    "derived respectively from the 3.5  cm and 3  mm maps , and the electron temperatures ( ) to those obtained from recombination line observations ( garay et al . 1998 ) .",
    "for source a at the 3 bands , d and f at 3  mm , and j at 2  cm , we defined an effective radius as that of a circle with the same area as the uc  region or the dusty shell .",
    "we assumed a mean  of 7200 k for the objects where  are not available in table 5 of garay et al .",
    "1998 . therefore , free parameters were the emission measure ( @xmath33 ) of the  region , and  and  of the dusty molecular shell .",
    "our spectral analysis shows that fluxes at 3  mm ( table  [ tbl : fit ] ) , 20.8 , 18.1 , and 11.7  ( de buizer et al . 2003 ) towards objects b , f , i , and the hc are fitted with combinations of thermal dust plus free - free emission , implying that they are likely to be embedded in dust cocoons .",
    "only the hc is not detected at cm wavelengths , which indicates that the putative embedded stars ( or star ) are too young or not massive enough to develop an uc  region .",
    "we favor the idea that the hc contains very young massive ( proto)star(s ) as it is in all aspects ( richness of the molecular composition , large mass of @xmath34 , high temperature of 65  k ) similar to the other hcs known in the literature , which are believed to be the cradle of early - type stars ( kurtz et al .",
    "if the hc contains a deeply embedded o - b star , one may estimate the maximum radius of the associated region from the sensitivity of the 3.5  cm image . assuming that the free - free emission is optically thick",
    ", such a radius must be smaller than 2.4@xmath35 pc .",
    "the continuum spectrum of d is rising from cm wavelengths to 3  mm ( table  [ tbl : fit ] ) , but does not show mir emission .",
    "this sets upper limits on  and .",
    "the 3  mm flux of source a ( 589@xmath29115  mjy ) is only marginally above the value expected ( 409  mjy ) from extrapolation of the free - free cm fluxes . considering the uncertainties and the fact that its effective @xmath32 is smaller than that of @xmath31",
    ", we believe that thermal dust emission is not dominant at 3  mm .",
    "finally , the spectrum of sources c , g , j , and k can be fitted with free - free emission only , suggesting that they have already dispersed most of the surrounding material .    an unbiased survey such as ours could be used to estimate the lifetime of hcs with respect to that of uc  regions on the basis of number ratio between the two . however",
    ", this applies only to a series of star formation episodes randomly distributed in time , and not if one is observing the result of a coherent burst of star formation ( e.g. welch et al .",
    "while in the former case the different numbers of sources in different evolutionary stages would be directly related to the time spent in each phase , in the latter hypothesis such numbers would be determined by the local physical conditions around individual stars .",
    "it is hence important to find out whether the ages of our sources are spread over a sufficiently large time interval or all very similar .",
    "naively , one might expect that the age of an  region is strictly related to its diameter .",
    "however the correspondence between size and age is still matter of debate .",
    "nevertheless , in most expansion models of an  region is related only to the spectral type of the star and to the properties of the surrounding environment .",
    "it is hence reasonable to assume that the expansion will come to an end when pressure equilibrium is reached between the ionized and the surrounding molecular gas . as illustrated by de pree , goss , & gaume ( 1998 ) , their eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 7 ) give the final  region radius ( @xmath36 ) as a function of the stellar lyman continuum photons ,  , and the density and temperature of the molecular gas .",
    "here we derived spectral types of b0 for a , b0.5 for b - d , f , g , i , k , and b1 for j. the value of @xmath36 should be compared to the current uc  radius measured from the maps .",
    "although it is impossible to obtain an `` absolute '' estimate of the age , ratios of @xmath37 may be used to estimate `` relative '' ages of uc  regions , with lower ratios corresponding to younger objects . to compute @xmath36",
    ", we used the corresponding values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and a mean density derived from the simba observations ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ) .",
    "the ratio ranges from 0.3 to 0.9 ( see table  [ tbl : fit ] ) .",
    "if the uc  regions have not yet reached pressure equilibrium with the surrounding cloud , such a ratio seems to indicate that they are in similar evolutionary stages , thus supporting the `` starburst '' scenario .",
    "however , several caveats are in order : the density of molecular gas may vary over the natal cloud and the lyman continuum of the stars may have been underestimated because of optically thick free - free emission and dust absorption inside the  region .",
    "this may easily introduce an uncertainty of an order of magnitude on @xmath36 thus making the `` starburst '' hypothesis questionable .",
    "in fact , the expansion timescales obtained from eq .",
    "( 3 ) of de pree , goss , & gaume ( 1998 ) span a small range ( 120480  yr ) , suggesting that the uc  regions are close to pressure equilibrium .",
    "it is hence worth considering also the opposite scenario , and take the number ratio between hcs and uc  regions as an estimate of their relative lifetimes .",
    "considering poisson statistical errors , the number of hcs and uc  regions are respectively 1@xmath291 and 9@xmath29@xmath42 , so that their ratio is @xmath43% .",
    "this implies that the hc phase ( @xmath44 ) should last less than @xmath01/3 of the uc  region phase ( @xmath45 ) , with a probability of 4% that the ratio exceeds this value .",
    "this conclusion seems to differ from that inferred for the o - star cluster in w49n ( wilner et al .",
    "2001 ) , where @xmath46100% .",
    "the two results could indicate that @xmath47@xmath48 .",
    "alternatively , the difference might be easily explained in the `` starburst '' scenario , where the ratio between hcs and uc  regions depends on the environment around each star .",
    "finally , another caveat is in order .",
    "our statistics might be affected by the limited sensitivity of our 3  mm map .",
    "as previously explained , we are sensitive to hcs with masses in excess of @xmath027  @xmath20 , whereas at cm wavelengths we detect stars earlier than b1 .",
    "if o stars are born in massive hcs and b stars in lower mass hcs , our comparison between uc  regions around b stars and hcs hiding o stars is bound to be unreliable .",
    "more numerous and sensitive interferometric observations of o - b star clusters will be needed to improve the statistics .",
