    "we have only one 10@xmath18@xmath30@xmath55@xmath3010@xmath14l@xmath8  ulirg in our sample , and its redshift is @xmath101.3 .",
    "this leaves the possibility that z@xmath102 hotter - dust ulirgs exist , but lie beneath current 250@xmath0mimaging depth .",
    "@xcite showed that at slightly lower redshifts , z@xmath101.5 , star - formation dominated hot - dust ulirgs ( @xmath85k , @xmath212@xmath510@xmath18l@xmath8 ) have been observed at 1/5 the volume density of smgs , but limitations in @xmath49-mips 70@xmath0 m  depth prevented significant detections at z2 .",
    "also , work by @xcite argues that hotter - dust @xmath2060k hylirgs at z@xmath102 are less prevalent based on co observations of submm - faint radio galaxies . after accounting for selection bias , the submm - faint ulirg sample was @xmath102@xmath5 less luminous in @xmath55 and @xmath86 than co - observed , cold - dust smgs .",
    "if we assume @xmath58 that high-@xmath22 ulirgs have the same dust temperature distribution as local ulirgs ( which have @xmath8745@xmath210k above 10@xmath14k ) , then there is a @xmath1060%  chance that no @xmath2060k sources are detected within a sample of seven sources ( given a gaussian distribution of dust temperatures for systems @xmath2010@xmath14l@xmath8 ) .",
    "this illustrates how limiting our sample size is when it comes to drawing conclusions for the whole 250@xmath0m - luminous population .",
    "for example , a sample of @xmath1030 sources with @xmath8860k must be detected in order for that likelihood to drop to 13% .",
    "more spectroscopic observations and fir characterisations of similar samples are needed from _ herschel _ and scuba-2 for real progress to be made in high-@xmath22 ulirg evolutionary studies , and to probe the differences with local ulirg populations .    despite its significant uncertainty",
    "given the small sample size , the lack of hot - dust systems ( @xmath2060k ) in the blast hylirg sample is consistent with predictions from sph simulations for infrared luminous galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "they suggest that the brightest high-@xmath22 starbursts ( @xmath2010@xmath14l@xmath8 ) are at their most active phase during the early stages of final merger in - fall , when gas and dust are diffuse , extended , and cold .",
    "warmer dust is suggested to condense either at a later stage merger , when gas and dust has collapsed and heated , or when it has been heated by a growing agn .",
    "while this sample of galaxies exhibits warm dust ( 30@xmath8950k ) , we have not detected any @xmath2010@xmath14l@xmath8hot - dust ( @xmath2060k ) systems in this sample and we find a modest agn fraction ( 20% ) ; therefore , our results loosely support the theory that the most luminous hylirgs are triggered by major merging events .",
    "it is important to once again consider the impact of confusion limitations and deboosting factors on our conclusions .",
    "we excluded the uncertainty in the deboosting factor from our results ( as discussed in ",
    "[ s : observations ] ) because its blind propagation into all of the bands in our sed fits is not justified .",
    "as is discussed , the deboosting uncertainty is likely to have far greater effect on @xmath21 than on @xmath54 or @xmath12 since boosting is correlated between fir bands . using a naive model where the main contribution to source confusion is a single additional source within the beam ,",
    "whose fir colours have the same distribution as seen in _ herschel _ populations , we estimate that the derived @xmath21 is uncertain by @xmath100.1dex and @xmath90 is uncertain by @xmath109k .",
    "however , without a proper understanding of the sources which boost the flux of our high-@xmath22 blast sample , it is very difficult to determine how the dust temperatures might change , although it is unlikely that the mean would shift far from the current mean , 52@xmath26k .",
    "this differential boosting issue should be investigated carefully with future , large _",
    "250@xmath0m - selected samples .",
    "the deboosting effect on luminosity is easier to quantify than the effect on @xmath54 .",
    "the maximum uncertainty for the deboosting factor found by @xcite is @xmath1050% , which would propagate to a factor of @xmath102 in luminosity .",
    "the mean luminosity of our sample is @xmath103@xmath510@xmath14l@xmath8 , a factor of @xmath105 - 10 greater than most high-@xmath22 ulirg populations in the literature .",
    "the factor @xmath102 difference caused by potential deboosting corrections is not significant in comparison .",
    "these 250@xmath0m - bright galaxies are still `` hylirgs , '' thus amongst the most luminous , extreme starbursts measured at high - redshift .",
    "the redshift identification of these 250@xmath0m - bright , z@xmath102 hylirgs has allowed a characterisation of their near - ir and fir properties , leading to the following conclusions :    near - ir spectroscopy ( as probed here by vlt isaac ) is an efficient way of identifying redshifts ( 50 - 70%  success rates ) for fir sources which have secure photometric redshifts .",
    "the redshift range of our sample is @xmath271.3 - 2.6 , averaging to @xmath912.0@xmath20.4 , making up the z1 subset of 250@xmath0m - bright blast galaxies .",
    "we also find that h@xmath4  star formation rates underpredict their fir sfrs by @xmath1035 times , and we measure metallicities which are in agreement with other high-@xmath22 galaxy samples , include those of much lower luminosities but of similar stellar mass .",
    "having multiple fir flux densities available for each object , we fit fir blackbody seds to each source and constrain @xmath21 , @xmath54 , and @xmath12 independent of radio flux density or mid - ir flux densities .",
    "we find that the fir / radio correlation holds , but that smg composite spectra , when fit to 24@xmath0 m  flux densities , do not successfully describe the fir properties of this sample .",
    "we measure fir luminosities @xmath103@xmath510@xmath14l@xmath8 , and dust temperatures averaging @xmath9252@xmath26k .",
    "however , we warn that both of these conclusions are sensitive to the effects of flux boosting in the fir , although we estimate that this should not change @xmath55 by more than a factor of @xmath102@xmath5 and @xmath81 beyond its quoted error .    since 250@xmath0 m  selection is more sensitive to the detection of hotter dust sources than smg selection ( at 850@xmath0 m ) , the lack of @xmath2060k hot - dust galaxies in our sample is potentially an indication that high-@xmath22 , high-@xmath93 galaxies are more extended ( with diffuse , cool dust ) on a whole than local ulirgs .",
    "however our small sample size limits this conclusion to only 40%  likelihood .",
    "a lack of @xmath2060k hot - dust specimens in the blast 250@xmath0 m  population could be telling to the galaxies evolutionary stage ; this work highlights the need for more observations of larger samples of similar and fainter sources .",
    "fir mapping at 70 - 500@xmath0 m  from _ herschel _ and scuba2 will further select rare and poorly studied high-@xmath22 ulirg populations like the galaxies presented here , and near - ir spectroscopic observations will enable further redshift identification of their counterparts , leading to a better characterisation of the ulirg phenomenon at high-@xmath22 .",
