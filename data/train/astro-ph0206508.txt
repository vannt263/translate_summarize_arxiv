    "this review presents astrophysical applications of an approach which has its origins in papers by jerzy neyman & elizabeth scott and their collaborators nearly fifty years ago .",
    "neyman & scott @xcite were interested in describing the spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "they argued that it was useful to think of the galaxy distribution as being made up of distinct clusters with a range of sizes .",
    "since galaxies are discrete objects , they described how to study statistical properties of a distribution of discrete points ; the description required knowledge of the distribution of cluster sizes , the distribution of points around the cluster center , and a description of the clustering of the clusters @xcite . at that time , none of these ingredients were known , and so in subsequent work @xcite , they focussed on inferring these parameters from data which was just becoming useful for statistical studies .    since that time",
    ", it has become clear that much of the mass in the universe is dark , and that this mass was initially rather smoothly distributed .",
    "therefore , the luminous galaxies we see today may be biased tracers of the dark matter distribution .",
    "that is to say , the relation between the number of galaxies in a randomly placed cell and the amount of dark matter the same cell contains , may be rather complicated .",
    "in addition , there is evidence that the initial fluctuation field was very close to a gaussian random field .",
    "linear and higher order perturbation theory descriptions of gravitational clustering from gaussian initial fluctuations have been developed ( see bernardeau et al .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) ; these describe the evolution and mildly non - linear clustering of the dark matter , but they break down when the clustering is highly non - linear ( typically , this happens on scales smaller than a few megaparsecs ) . also , perturbation theory provides no rigorous framework for describing how the clustering of galaxies differs from that of the dark matter .    the non - linear evolution of the dark matter distribution has also been studied extensively using numerical simulations of the large scale structure clustering process .",
    "these simulations show that an initially smooth matter distribution evolves into a complex network of sheets , filaments and knots ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : halos ] ) .",
    "the dense knots are often called dark matter halos . high resolution , but relatively small volume , simulations have been used to provide detailed information about the distribution of mass in and around such halos ( i.e. , the halo density profile of @xcite ) , whereas larger volume , but lower resolution simulations ( e.g. , the hubble volume simulations @xcite of the virgo consortium@xcite ) , have provided information about the abundance and spatial distribution of halos @xcite .",
    "simulations such as these show that the halo abundance , spatial distribution , and internal density profiles are closely related to the properties of the initial fluctuation field .",
    "when these halos are treated as the analogs of neyman & scott s clusters , their formalism provides a way to describe the spatial statistics of the dark matter density field from the linear to highly non - linear regimes .",
    "such a halo based description of the dark matter distribution of large scale structure is extremely useful because , following white & rees @xcite , the idea that galaxies form within such dark matter halos has gained increasing credence . in this picture ,",
    "the physical properties of galaxies are determined by the halos in which they form .",
    "therefore , the statistical properties of a given galaxy population are determined by the properties of the parent halo population .",
    "there are now a number of detailed semianalytic models which implement this approach @xcite ; they combine simple physically motivated galaxy formation recipes with the halo population output from a numerical simulation of the clustering of the dark matter distribution to make predictions about how the galaxy and dark matter distributions differ ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : gif ] ) .    in the white & rees based models , different galaxy types populate different halos .",
    "therefore , the halo based approach provides a simple and natural way of modelling the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy type in these models .",
    "it is also the natural way of modelling the difference between the clustering of galaxies relative to dark matter .    just as the number of galaxies in a randomly placed cell may be a biased tracer of the amount of dark matter in it , other physical properties such as the pressure , the velocity or the momentum , of a cell are also biased tracers of the amount of dark matter a cell contains .",
    "the assumption that dark matter halos are in virial equilibrium allows one to estimate these physical properties for any given halo .",
    "if the distribution of halos in a randomly chosen cell is known , then the halo  based approach allows one to estimate statistical properties of , say , the pressure and the momentum , analogously to how it transforms the statistics of the dark matter field into that for galaxies .    data from large area imaging and redshift surveys of galaxies ( e.g. , the 2dfgrs and the sloan digital sky survey ) are now becoming available ; these will provide constraints on the dark matter distribution on large scales , and on galaxy formation models on smaller scales .",
    "weak gravitational lensing @xcite provides a more direct probe of the dark matter density field .",
    "the first generation of wide - field weak lensing surveys , which cover a few square degrees are now complete ( see recent reviews by bartlemann & schneider  @xcite and mellier  @xcite ) , and the next generation of lensing surveys will cover several hundreds of square degrees .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect  @xcite , due to the inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off hot electrons in clusters , is a probe of the distribution of the pressure on large scales .",
    "several wide - field surveys of the sz are currently planned ( see review by birkinshaw @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the next generation cmb experiments will measure temperature fluctuations on small angular scales . on these small scales",
    "the density , velocity , momentum and pressure fields of the dark and/or baryonic matter leave their imprints on the cmb in a wide variety of ways .",
    "for example , in addition to the thermal and kinematic sz effects , the small scale temperature fluctuations are expected to be weakly lensed .",
    "the halo model provides a single self - consistent framework for modelling and interpretting all these observations .",
    "the purpose of this review is twofold .",
    "the first is to outline the principles which underly the halo approach .",
    "the second is to compare the predictions of this approach with results from simulations and observations .",
    "section  1 introduces background materials which are relevant for this review .",
    "sections  2 to  5 present the halo approach to clustering .",
    "what we know about dark matter halos is summarized in  3 , how this information is incorporated into the halo model is discussed in  4 , and the first result , the halo model description of the dark matter density field is presented in  5 . the galaxy distribution is discussed in  6 , the velocity and momentum fields are studied in  7 , weak gravitational lensing in  8 , and secondary effects on the cosmic microwave background , including the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects @xcite , and the non - linear integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , are the subject of  9 .",
    "we have chosen to discuss those aspects of the halo model which are relevant for the statistical studies of clustering , such as the two - point correlation functions and higher order statistics .",
    "we do not discuss what cosmological and astrophysical information can be deduced from the redshift distribution and evolution of halo number counts .",
    "the abundance of halos at high redshift is an important ingredient in models of reionization and the early universe .",
    "we do not discuss any of these models here , since they are described in the recent review by barkana & loeb @xcite .",
    "finally , our description of the clustering of halos relies on some results from perturbation theory which we do not derive in detail here . for these ,",
    "we refer the reader to the recent comprehensive review on the pertubation theory description of gravitational clustering by bernardeau et al .",
    "this section describes the properties of adiabatic cold dark matter ( cdm ) models which are relevant to the present review .",
    "the expansion rate for adiabatic cdm cosmological models with a cosmological constant is @xmath0\\ , , \\label{eqn : hubble}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 can be written as the inverse hubble distance today @xmath2mpc .",
    "the critical density is @xmath3 .",
    "the total density is a sum over different components @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for the cold dark matter , @xmath6 for the cosmological constant , and @xmath7 for baryons .",
    "our convention will be to denote the contribution to the total density from component @xmath4 , as @xmath8 .",
    "the contribution of spatial curvature to the expansion rate is @xmath9 , and the matter density is @xmath10 .",
    "convenient measures of distance and time include the conformal distance ( or lookback time ) from the observer at redshift @xmath11 @xmath12 ( we have set @xmath13 ) and the angular diameter distance @xmath14 note that as @xmath15 , @xmath16 and we define @xmath17 .",
    "the dark matter density field in the adiabatic cdm model possesses @xmath18point correlation functions , defined in the usual way .",
    "that is , in real coordinate space , the @xmath18point correlation function @xmath19 of density fluctuations @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 here , we have expressed the density perturbations in the universe as fluctuations relative to the background mean density , @xmath22 : @xmath23    if all the @xmath24 are the same , then @xmath25 we will almost always consider the case in which @xmath26 .",
    "many of the calculations to follow simplify considerably in fourier space . throughout , we will use the following fourier space conventions : @xmath27 \\",
    ",   \\label{ftconvention}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the dirac delta function , which is not to be confused with the density perturbation which does not have the subscript @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the real space fluctuations in the density field is a sum over fourier modes : @xmath29 and the two , three and four - point fourier - space correlations are @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the quantities @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are known as the power spectrum , bispectrum and trispectrum , respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath35 the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum are fourier transform pairs .",
    "similarly , we can relate higher order correlations and their fourier space analogies .    rather than working with @xmath36 itself ,",
    "it is often more convenient to use the dimensionless quantity @xmath37 which is the power per logarithmic interval in wavenumber .",
    "similarly , we can define a scaled dimensionless quantity for the nth fourier space correlation such that it scales roughly as the logarithmic power spectrum defined above : @xmath38^{\\frac{1}{n } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    we will also often use the quantity @xmath39 this is the variance in the smoothed density field when the smoothing window has scale @xmath40 .",
    "if the window is a tophat in real space , then @xmath41 ( \\sin kr - ( kr ) \\cos kr)$ ] ; it is @xmath42 if the real space smoothing window is a gaussian : @xmath43/\\sqrt{2\\pi r^2}$ ] .",
    "the initial perturbations due to inflation are expected to be gaussian @xcite , so they can be characterized by a power spectrum or a two point correlation function ( wick s theorem states that , for a gaussian field , correlations involving an odd number of density fluctuations are exactly zero ) .",
    "thus , the bispectrum and trispectrum are defined so that , for a gaussian field , they are identically zero ; in the jargon , this means that only the connected piece is used to define them , hence the subscript @xmath44 in the expression equation  ( [ eqn : pobitri ] ) .",
    "all these quantities evolve . here and throughout",
    ", we do not explicitly write the redshift dependence when we believe no confusion will arise .      the large scale structure we see today is thought to be due to the gravitational evolution of initially gaussian fluctuations @xcite . in an expanding universe filled with cdm particles , the action of gravity results in the generation of higher order correlations : the initially gaussian distribution becomes non - gaussian .",
    "the perturbation theory description of the gravitational evolution of density perturbations is well developed @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize some of the results which are most relevant for what is to follow .",
    "the evolution of large scale structure density perturbations are governed by the continuity equation , @xmath45 and the euler equation , @xmath46 = 0 \\ , ,   \\label{eqn : euler}\\ ] ] where the potential fluctuations due to density perturbations are related by the poisson equation : @xmath47 while the peculiar velocity is related to the hubble flow via @xmath48    the linear regime is the one in which @xmath49 . in the linear regime",
    ", the continuity and euler equations may be combined to yield @xcite @xmath50 this is a second - order differential equation with two independent solutions ; these correspond to modes which grow and decay with time . for our purposes ,",
    "only the growing mode solution of equation  ( [ eqn : combined ] ) is relevant .",
    "this has the form @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 ^ 3 \\nonumber \\\\       & \\approx & { 5\\over 2 } { \\omega_m(z)/(1+z)\\over        \\omega_m(z)^{4/7 } - \\omega_\\lambda(z ) + ( 1-\\omega_m(z)/2)(1 + \\omega_\\lambda(z)/70)}.   \\label{eqn : growth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that the linear theory density field may be scaled in time , or redshift , with the use of the growth solution @xmath53 .",

    "a scale free form for @xmath58 is rather generic ; models of inflation generally produce @xmath59 ( the so - called harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 , defined such that @xmath61 , describes departures from the initially scale free form .",
    "departures are expected because the energy density of the universe is dominated by radiation at early times but by matter at late times , and the growth rate of perturbations in the radiation dominated era differs from that in the matter dominated era .",
    "the transition from one to the other produces a turnover in the shape of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "baryons and other species , such as massive neutrinos , leave other important features in the transfer function which can potentially be extracted from observational data .",
    "accurate fitting functions for @xmath60 which include these effects have been available for some time @xcite .",
    "when illustrating calculations presented in this review , we use fits to the transfer functions given by @xcite .",
    "when written in comoving coordinates , the continuity equation ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) shows that the fourier transforms of the linear theory ( i.e. , when @xmath62 ) density and velocity fields are related @xcite : @xmath63 where the derivative is with respect to the radial distance @xmath64 defined in equation  ( [ eqn : rad ] ) .",

    "these coefficients are @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is defined by inserting the linear theory value of @xmath96 in equation  ( [ sigmar ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 if the initial spectrum is a power - law with slope @xmath57 .",
    "for the cdm family of spectra , one can neglect derivatives of @xmath100 with respect to scale for @xmath101 @xmath102 mpc .",

    "although all derivations to follow will be general , we will often illustrate our results with the currently favored @xmath6cdm cosmological model . following the definition of the expansion rate ( equation  [ eqn : hubble ] ) and the power spectrum of linear density field ( equation  [ eqn : linpk ] ) , the relevant parameters for this model are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the associated power spectrum of linear fluctuations is normalized to match the observed anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background at the largest scales , i.e. , those measured by the cobe mission .",
    "this means @xcite that we set @xmath110 .",
    "a constraint on the shape of the spectrum also follows from specifying the amplitude of the power spectrum on a smaller scale .",
    "this additional constraint is usually phrased as requiring that @xmath111 , the rms value of the linear density fluctuation field when it is smoothed with a tophat filter of scale @xmath112 mpc ( i.e. , @xmath111 is calculated using equation  [ sigmar ] with @xmath112 mpc ) , has a specified value .",
    "this value is set by requiring that the resulting fluctuations are able to produce the observed abundance of galaxy clusters .",
    "uncertainties in the conversion of x - ray flux , or temperature , to cluster mass , yield values for @xmath111 which are in the range ( 0.5  0.6)@xmath113 @xcite .",
    "another constraint on the value of @xmath111 is that when properly evolved to past , the same density power spectrum should also match associated fluctuations in the cmb ; the two constraints are generally in better agreement in a cosmology with a cosmological constant than in an open universe .",
    "the use of a realistic value for @xmath111 is important because higher order correlations typically depend non - linearly on the amplitude of the initial linear density field .",
    "the following ansatz , due to @xcite , provides a good description of the two - point correlations in real space , @xmath114 , and in fourier space , @xmath36 , even in the regime where perturbation theory becomes inaccurate .",
    "the argument is that non - linear gravitational evolution rescales all lengths , so pairs initially separated by scale @xmath115 will later be separated by a different scale , say @xmath116 .",

    "the parameters of the above fit come from a handful of simulations and are valid for a limited number of cosmological models .",
    "fits to the non - linear power spectrum in some cosmological models containing dark energy are provided by @xcite .",
    "although this ansatz , and the associated fitting function represents a significant step beyond perturbation theory , there have been no successful extensions of it to higher order clustering statistics .",
    "in addition , it is not obvious how to extend it to describe fields other than the density of dark matter .    hyper - extended perturbation theory ( hept ; @xcite ) represents a reasonably successful attempt to extract what is known from perturbation theory and apply it in the highly nonlinear regime .",

    "in this section , and the next , we will describe an approach which allows one to describe all @xmath18point correlations of large scale structure .",
    "this description can be used to study clustering of a variety of physical quantities , including the dark matter density field , the galaxy distribution , the pressure , the momentum , and others .",
    "the approach assumes that all the mass in the universe is partitioned up into distinct units , which we will often call halos . if distinct halos can be identified , then it is likely that they are small compared to the typical distances between them .",
    "this then suggests that the statistics of the mass density field on small scales are determined by the spatial distribution within the halos ; the precise way in which the halos themselves may be organized into large scale structures is not important . on the other hand ,",
    "the details of the internal structure of the halos can not be important on scales larger than a typical halo ; on large scales , the important ingredient is the spatial distribution of the halos .",
    "this realization , that the distribution of the mass can be studied in two steps : the distribution of mass within each halo , and the spatial distribution of the halos themselves , is the key to what has come to be called the halo model .",
    "the halo model assumes that , in addition to thinking of the spatial statistics in two steps , it is useful and accurate to think of the physics in two steps also . in particular , the model assumes that the regime in which the physics is not described by perturbation theory is confined to regions within halos , and that halos can be adequately approximated by assuming that they are in virial equilibrium .",
    "clearly , then , the first and the most important step is to find a suitable definition of the underlying units , i.e. the halos .",
    "this section describes what we know about the abundance , spatial distribution , and internal density profiles of halos .",
    "all these quantities depend primarily on halo mass . in the next section ,",
    "we combine these ingredients together to build the halo model of large scale structure .      the assumption that non - linear objects formed from a spherical collapse is a simple and useful approximation .",
    "the spherical collapse of an initially tophat density perturbation was first studied in 1972 by gunn & gott  @xcite ; see  @xcite for a discussion of spherical collapse from other initial density profiles .    in the tophat model ,",
    "one starts with a region of initial , comoving lagrangian size @xmath140 .",
    "let @xmath141 denote the initial density within this region .",
    "we will suppose that the initial fluctuations were gaussian with an rms value on scale @xmath140 which was much less than unity .",
    "therefore , @xmath142 almost surely .",
    "this means that the mass @xmath143 within @xmath140 is @xmath144 where @xmath145 denotes the comoving background density .",
    "as the universe evolves , the size of this region changes",
    ". let @xmath40 denote the comoving size of the region at some later time .",
    "the density within the region is @xmath146 . in the spherical collapse model",
    "there is a deterministic relation between the initial comoving lagrangian size @xmath140 and density of an object , and its eulerian size @xmath40 at any subsequent time . for an einstein ",
    "de sitter universe , one can obtain a parametric solution to @xmath147 in terms of @xmath148 : @xmath149 where @xmath150 denotes the initial density @xmath141 extrapolated using linear theory to the present time ( e.g. @xcite ) . if @xmath151 , then @xmath152 should be replaced with @xmath153 and @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "in the spherical collapse model , initially overdense regions collapse : with @xmath156 at start , they ` turnaround ' at @xmath157 , and have collapsed completely when @xmath158 .",

    ", the average density within the region is even higher : formally , @xmath161 , so the density at collapse is infinite . in practice",
    "the region does not collapse to vanishingly small size : it virializes at some non - zero size . the average density within the virialized object is usually estimated as follows .",
    "assume that after turning around the object virializes at half the value of the turnaround radius in physical , rather than comoving units .",
    "in the time between turnaround and collapse , the background universe expands by a factor of @xmath162 ( from equation  [ scmodel ] ) , so the virialized object is eight times denser than it was at turnaround ( because @xmath163 ) .",
    "the background density at turnaround is @xmath164 times the background density at @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , the virialized object is @xmath166 times the density of the background at virialization .    what was the initial overdensity of such an object ?",
    "the first of equations  ( [ scmodel ] ) shows that if the region is to collapse at @xmath167 , the average density within it must have had a critical value , @xmath168 , given by @xmath169 thus , a collapsed object is one in which the initial overdensity , extrapolated using linear theory to the time of collapse , was @xmath170 . at this time , the actual overdensity is significantly larger than the linear theory prediction .",
    "although the formal overdensity is infinite , a more practical estimate ( equation  [ dvir ] ) says that the object is about 178 times denser than the background .",
    "there is an important feature of the spherical collapse model which is extremely useful .",

    "the prediction based on the simplifications in equation  ( [ eqn : rapprox ] ) tend to overestimate the non - gaussianity at lower redshifts while underestimates it at higher redshifts , though the exact transition depends on the angular scale of interest ; this behavior can be understood due to the fact that we do not consider the full lensing window function but only the contributions at an effective redshift , midway between the observer and sources .    in order to determine whether its the increase in volume or the decrease in the growth of structures that lead to a decrease in the relative importance of non - gaussianities as one moves to a higher source redshift , we calculated the non - gaussian to gaussian variance ratio under the halo model for several source redshifts and survey volumes .",
    "up to source redshifts @xmath346 1.5 , the increase in volume decreases the non - gaussian contribution significantly .",
    "when surveys are sensitive to sources at redshifts beyond 1.5 , the increase in volume becomes less significant and the decrease in the growth of structures begin to be important in decreasing the non - gaussian contribution . since , in the deeply non - linear regime , @xmath341 scales with redshift as the cube of the growth factor , this behavior is consistent with the overall redshift scaling of the volume and growth .",
    "the importance of the non - gaussianity to the variance also scales linearly with bin width .",
    "as one increases the bin width the covariance induced by the non - gaussianity manifests itself as increased variance relative to the gaussian case .",
    "the normalization of @xmath40 is therefore somewhat arbitrary in that it depends on the binning scheme , i.e. @xmath347 does not necessarily mean non - gaussianity can be entirely neglected when summing over all the bins .",
    "the scaling with redshift and the overall scaling of the variance with the survey area @xmath348 is not .",
    "one way to get around the increased non - gaussianity associated with shallow surveys , is to have it sample a wide patch of sky since @xmath349 .",
    "this relation tells us the trade off between designing an survey to go wide instead of deep .",
    "one should bear in mind though that not only will shallow surveys have decreasing number densities of source galaxies and hence increasing shot noise , they will also suffer more from the decreasing amplitude of the signal itself and the increasing importance of systematic effects , including the intrinsic correlations of galaxy shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these problems tilt the balance more towards deep but narrow surveys than the naive statistical scaling would suggest .      with steady improvements in the observational front ,",
    "it is likely that weak lensing will eventually reach its full ability as a complimentary probe of cosmological parameters when compared to angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for a proper interpretation of observational measurements of lensing convergence power spectrum or shear correlation functions , it will be essential to include the associated full covariance or error matrix in upcoming analyses . in the absence of many fields where",
    "the covariance can be estimated directly from the data , the halo model provides a useful , albeit model dependent , quantification of the covariance . as a practical approach one could imagine taking the variances estimated from the survey under a gaussian approximation , but which accounts for uneven sampling and edge effects @xcite , and scaling it up by the non - gaussian to gaussian variance ratio of the halo model along with inclusion of the band power correlations . additionally , it is in principle possible to use the expected correlations from the halo model to decorrelate individual band power measurements , similar to studies involving cmb temperature anisotropy and galaxy power spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting non - gaussian effects on cosmological parameter estimation was discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , the potential of wide - field lensing surveys to measure cosmological parameters was investigated using the gaussian approximation of a diagonal covariance and fisher matrix techniques .",
    "the fisher matrix is simply a projection of the covariance matrix , @xmath350 , onto the basis of cosmological parameters @xmath351 @xmath352 where the total covariance includes both the signal and noise covariance . under the approximation of gaussian shot noise",
    ", this reduces to replacing @xmath353 in the expressions leading up to the covariance equation  ( [ eqn : variance ] ) . in the case where non - gaussian contribution to the covariance is ignored ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : fisher ] ) reduces to @xcite @xmath354 under the approximation that there are a sufficient number of modes in the band powers that the distribution of power spectrum estimates is approximately gaussian , the fisher matrix quantifies the best possible errors on cosmological parameters that can be achieved by a given survey . in particular",
    "@xmath355 is the optimal covariance matrix of the parameters and @xmath356 is the optimal error on the @xmath4th parameter .    for a cosmological model involving a set of 5 parameters , @xmath188 , normalization of the power spectrum , @xmath357 , @xmath358 and @xmath359 , cooray & hu @xcite found that non - gaussianities increase the uncertainties of each of the 5 parameters determined from an all - sky experiment down to the 25th magnitude , and assuming all sources at a redshift of @xmath346 1 , by about @xmath346 10 to 15% . in the case of weak lensing ,",
    "the shot - noise due to finite number of background sources and their intrinsic ellipticity becomes the dominant error before the non - gaussian effects dominate over the gaussian noise .",
    "thus , for the above assumed depth and redshift , the non - gaussian effect on cosmological parameters is some what insignificant . for certain planned deeper surveys with better imaging , such as planned surveys with large - aperture synoptic telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) ,",
    "the shot - noise term will be subdominant and the non - gaussian contributions may be more important for a precise determination of the cosmological parameters . as discussed with scaling relations ,   [ sec : scalings ] , the intrinsic non - gaussian contribution to the onset of non - linearity decreases with increasing survey depth , and thus , deeper surveys are in fact preferred over shallow ones for the purposes of cosmological lensing work .      our description for the galaxy power spectrum ,",
    "[ sec : galaxy ] , allows us to extend the discussion to also consider the cross - correlation between galaxies and mass .",
    "such a cross - power spectrum can be probed through two independent methods : ( 1 ) the weak lensing tangential shear - galaxy correlation function and ( 2 ) the foreground - background source correlation function .",
    "as we find later , these two correlations probe different scales in the galaxy - mass power spectrum .",
    "the shear - galaxy correlation function can be constructed by correlating tangential shear of background galaxies surrounding foreground galaxies .",
    "the assumption is that these foreground galaxies trace the mass distribution along the line of sight to background sources . here",
    ", observations involve the mean tangential shear due to gravitational lensing which is related to convergence through @xmath360 where @xmath361 is the mean convergence within a circular radius of @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "since the shear , averaged over a circular aperture , is correlated with foreground galaxy positions , one essentially probes the galaxy - mass correlation discussed in   [ sec : galaxy - mass ] such that @xmath362 following equation  ( [ eqn : tangential ] ) , we can write the mean tangential shear involved with galaxy - galaxy lensing as @xmath363 here , @xmath364 is the lensing window function introduced in equation  ( [ eqn : weight ] ) , while @xmath365 is the normalized redshift distribution of foreground galaxies .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath364 involves the redshift distribution of background sources beyond the simple single source redshift assumption we have considered in prior calculations .",
    "the highest signal - to - noise measurement yet of tangential lensing correlation around foreground galaxies comes from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we compare these measurements with a prediction based on the halo model in figure  [ fig : sloanshear ] . here , for simplicity , we take the same description for galaxy number counts as introduced in   [ sec : galaxy ] , and calculate the galaxy - dark matter correlation function following equations  ( [ eqn : galdm1h ] ) . in calculating the expected correlation function ,",
    "we have used the expected redshift distributions for foreground and background galaxies in the sloan samples .",
    "the observed measurements shown in figure  [ fig : sloanshear ] comes from the sloan survey for field galaxies ; tangential shear around a selected sample of 42 foreground galaxy clusters in sloan data were recently presented by @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the galaxy - galaxy lensing correlation function , similar to the above , was interpreted by a mass and a size distribution for foreground galaxies with foreground galaxies generally assumed to be distributed randomly .",
    "this , or similar approaches , allow constraints on certain galaxy properties such as mass and size ( see , @xcite for details ) .",
    "the halo model provides an alternative , and perhaps an improved , description consistent with our basic ideas of large scale structure : since galaxies effectively trace the dark matter halos and it is the dark matter that is mostly responsible for the tangential lensing of background sources , the constraints on mass and size effectively applies to halos that galaxies reside in .",
    "if field galaxies are simply selected as foreground sources , then , the constraint on mass and size applies to the dark matter halo of the sample , each of which contains a single galaxy .",
    "if the foreground sample contains contributions from a wide variety of dark matter halo mass scales , then more than one galaxy can reside in dark matter halos at the high mass end and a simple interpretation may not be possible . additionally ,",
    "since halos distribute the large scale structure , one should account for the clustering component , i.e. , .",
    "the 2-halo term of the dark matter - galaxy correlation function , when extracting statistical properties related to individual halos that contribute along the line of sight . as shown in figure  [ fig : sloanshear ] , the total halo model prediction , both due to individual halos and their clustering , is consistent with observed measurements ; the correlation at largest angular scales is due to the intrinsic clustering of halos and can not be simply interpreted as a large extent for the dark matter halos . a more thorough study of the weak lensing shear - galaxy cross - correlation , under the halo model , is available in @xcite and we refer the reader to this paper for further details .",
    "the second observational probe of the galaxy - mass correlation function comes from the clustering of background sources around foreground objects .",
    "one can construct a power spectrum by simply counting the number of objects , such as quasars or x - ray sources , surrounding a sample of foreground sources , such as galaxies .",
    "the dependence on the correlation comes from the fact that foreground sources trace the mass density field which can potentially affect the number counts of background sources by the weak lensing effect .    to understand this correlation",
    ", we can consider a sample of background sources whose number counts can be written as @xmath366 where @xmath367 is the flux and @xmath368 is the slope of number counts with @xmath369 where @xmath370 ; the logarithmic slope of the magnitude counts ] .",
    "due to lensing , when the amplification involved is @xmath83 , one probes to a lower flux limit @xmath371 while the total number of sources are reduced by another factor @xmath83 ; the latter results from the decrease in volume such that the total surface brightness is conserved in lensing .",
    "thus , in the presence of lensing , number counts are changed to @xmath372 in the limit of weak lensing , as more appropriate for the large scale structure , @xmath373 where convergence @xmath374 was defined in equation  ( [ eqn : kappa ] ) .",
    "this allows us to write the fluctuations in background number counts , @xmath375 $ ] , in the presence of foreground lensing as @xcite @xmath376 where the lensing weight function integrates over the background source population following equation  ( [ eqn : weight ] ) .",
    "the foreground sources are assumed to trace the density field and based on the source clustering , one can write the fluctuations in the foreground source population , @xmath377 $ ] , as @xmath378 where @xmath379 is the radial distribution of foreground sources .",
    "we can write the correlation between the foreground and background sources as @xmath380 where we have simplified using the fourier expansion of equations  ( [ eqn : background ] ) and ( [ eqn : foreground ] ) , and have introduced the galaxy - mass power spectrum .    in the case where foreground and background sources are not distinctively separated in radial distance , note that there may be an additional correlation resulting from the fact that background sources trace the same overlapping density field traced by the foreground sources .",
    "this leads to a clustering term where @xmath381 where @xmath382 is now the cross power spectrum between foreground source sample , galaxies in this case , and the population of background sources , such as quasars .",
    "this cross power spectrum can be modeled under the halo approach by introducing a relationship between how background sources populate dark matter halos similar to the description for galaxies .",
    "this clustering component usually becomes a source of contamination for the detection of background source - foreground galaxy correlation due to weak lensing alone .",
    "note that background - foreground source correlation , equation  ( [ eqn : b - f ] ) , and the tangential shear - foreground galaxy correlation , equation  ( [ eqn : tanshear ] ) , weigh the galaxy - mass cross - power spectrum with two different window functions involving a @xmath383 and a @xmath384 , respectively . for a given projected distance @xmath385 , the two observational methods probe the galaxy - mass power spectrum at different scales .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : j0j2 ] , the tangential shear - foreground galaxy correlation function probes the non - linear scales of the galaxy - mass correlation and , thus , more sensitive to the behavior of the single - halo contribution than the foreground - background correlation function of sources .",
    "the dependence of the non - linear scales in the shear - galaxy correlation suggests that it is more suitable to probe the physical aspects of how foreground galaxies trace their dark matter halos . on the other hand ,",
    "the foreground - background source correlation function probes the clustering aspects of foreground sources that trace the linear density field .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sdssgalqso ] , we show the expected correlation between foreground galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey and background quasars at redshifts greater than 1 .",
    "the expected errors suggest that the correlation will be measured out to angular scales of several degrees .",
    "since sufficient statistics will soon be available , the catalog can be divided in to redshift bins and be combined with associated data on the shear - galaxy correlation for detailed studies on galaxy - mass cross clustering .",
    "the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations is now a well known probe of cosmology .",
    "the anisotropies can be well described through linear physics involving compton scattering and linearized general relativity .",
    "the well known features in the power spectrum , the acoustic oscillations at large angular scales and the damping tail at medium angular scales @xcite , allow the ability to constrain most , or certain combinations of , parameters that define the currently favored cdm models with a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this has led to a wide number of experimental attempts with results so far suggesting the evidence for acoustic peaks as expected in models with adiabatic initial conditions and a scale invariant power spectrum of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the small angular scale temperature anisotropies contain a wide - variety of information related to the growth and evolution of large scale structure including non - linear aspects of clustering .",
    "such a contribution from the low redshifts is partly contrary to the general assumption that cmb fluctuations are solely described by linear physics at the last scattering at a redshift @xmath346 1100 .",
    "there are two methods by which large scale structure of the local universe can modify cmb temperature : gravity and scattering .",
    "the gravitational contributions arise from variations in the frequency of cmb photons via gravitational redshifts and blueshifts @xcite and via deflection @xcite and time - delay @xcite effects on cmb photons due to gravitational lensing . in the reionized epoch , with a population of free electrons , the cmb photons can also be compton - scattered @xcite .",
    "the large scale structure contributions to cmb , either due to gravity or scattering , can be modeled using the halo approach and their statistical properties can be calculated in detail , similar to the application of the halo models to galaxy and weak lensing statistics . here",

    "the anisotropy power spectrum at small angular scales has recently become the focus of several theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "though there are several upper - limits and an initial detection of anisotropy power at small scales @xcite , a wide - field cmb image is yet to be produced with resolution necessary for studies related to secondary effects . to this end , several experiments are now working towards obtaining such information either from direct imaging or interferometric techniques .",
    "these experimental attempts include the proposed 12 deg.@xmath386 survey by @xcite at the combined and expanded bima and ovro arrays ( carma ) , the atacama telescope ( act ; lyman page , private communication ) , and the bolocam array on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( andrew lange , private communication ) . in the longer term , a few thousand sqr .",
    "degrees is proposed to be imaged in a few years with a wide - field bolometer array at the south pole telescope ( john carlstrom , private communication ) and the planck surveyor will allow detailed studies of certain secondary effects and foreground via multi - frequency all - sky maps .",
    "the sz thermal effect arises from the inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons by hot electrons along the line of sight .",
    "this effect has now been directly imaged towards massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where temperature of the scattering medium can reach as high as 10 kev producing temperature changes in the cmb of order 1 mk at rayleigh - jeans wavelengths .",
    "the sz effect is now well known for its main cosmological application involving measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "the basic idea follows from the initial suggestions by gunn @xcite and silk & white @xcite : the sz temperature decrement , @xmath387 , towards a given cluster can be combined with thermal bremsstrahlung x - ray emission , @xmath388 , towards the same cluster to obtain an estimate of the line of sight distance through the cluster : @xmath389 .",
    "this requires a measurement of @xmath390 across the cluster ; the isothermal assumption @xmath391 is generally employed due to limitations on the observational front .",
    "a comparison of this distance to the projected separation of the cluster across the sky determines the angular diameter distance to the cluster , independent of cosmological distance ladder ( see , @xcite for recent @xmath1 measurements ) . through a cosmological model for the distance",
    ", one can extract parameters such as the hubble constant and with measurements over a wide range in redshift , values for the matter density and the cosmological constant .",
    "there are several limitations that prohibit a reliable measurement of the hubble constant from the combined sz and x - ray data , at least in the case of a single cluster .",
    "the usual spherical assumption for clusters are inconsistent with observations and can bias the distance measurement at the level of 10% to 20% @xcite .",
    "the isothermal assumption for electron temperature has been shown to be inconsistent with numerically simulated galaxy cluster gas distributions , though , this assumption is yet to be tested with observations of galaxy clusters . in the case of clusters with significant cooling flows , it is clear that a single temperature can not be used to describe the electron temperature ; this again leads to biases at the few tens of percent level @xcite .",
    "additional contributions at the 10% level and less include , the presence of contaminating radio point sources , either in the cluster @xcite or background sources gravitationally lensed by the cluster potential @xcite , fluctuations in the background anisotropies lensed through the cluster @xcite and the peculiar velocity contribution to the kinetic sz effect .",
    "though , in general , these effects limit the reliability of the hubble constant measured towards a single cluster , a significant sample of clusters is expected to produce a measurement that is within the few percent level . in the case of projection effects involving ellipsoidal clusters , distributed following ellipticities observed for present - day cluster samples , it can be shown that for a sample of at least 25 or more clusters , the mean hubble constant is consistent with the true value @xcite .    in the future when wide - field sz surveys are available , we are more interested in the statistics of sz effect , such as the sz correlation function or power spectrum in real space .",
    "since on top of the sz effect , one also gets a contribution from the cmb anisotropy fluctuations , it is clear that one requires reliable ways to separate them and also contaminant foregrounds such as radio point sources and galactic dust . due to the nature of inverse - compton scattering , where photons are upscattered from low to high frequencies , the sz effect , fortunately , bears a spectral signature that differs from other temperature fluctuations including the dominant cmb primary component ( see , figure  [ fig : szfreq ] ) . in upcoming multifrequency cmb data ,",
    "thus , the sz contribution can be separated using its frequency dependence .",

    "for example , as discussed in @xcite and illustrated in figure  [ fig : szpower](b ) , with the maximum mass decreased from @xmath444 to @xmath445 m@xmath207 , the sz power spectrum reduced by a factor nearly two orders of magnitude in large scales and an order of magnitude at @xmath446 .",

    "the difference associated with mass dependence between the two effects suggests that a wide - field sz thermal effect map and a wide - field sz kinetic effect map will be different from each other in that massive halos , or clusters , will be clearly visible in a sz thermal map while the large scale structure will be more evident in a sz kinetic effect map . as shown with the thermal and kinetic sz maps in figure  [ fig : tszksz ] from @xcite , numerical simulations are in fact consistent with this picture ( see , also @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , since the kinetic sz due to peculiar motion peaks in the center of the halo where the density is highest , while the rotational effect peaks away from the center , the difference between maximal peculiar kinetic sz and rotational kinetic sz temperature fluctuations is even greater .",
    "note , however , each individual cluster has a different orientation and magnitude of peculiar velocity and rotation , thus the velocity - to - rotation ratio could vary a lot . in favorable cases where",

    "fig : secondary ] , we show the kinetic sz effect towards the same cluster due to the peculiar motion and the contribution resulting from the lensed cmb towards the same cluster .",

    "previously , it was suggested that the lensed cmb contribution can be extracted based on its dipole like signature .",
    "given the fact that the rotational contribution also leads to a similar pattern , any temperature distribution with a dipole pattern across a cluster can not easily be prescribed to the lensing effect .",
    "however , as evident from figures  [ fig : rotational ] and [ fig : secondary ] , the dipole signature associated with the rotational scattering is limited to the inner region of the cluster while the lensing effect , due to its dependence on the gradient of the dark halo potential , covers a much larger extent .",
    "also , the two dipoles need not lie in the same direction as the background gradient of the primary cmb fluctuations and the rotational axis of halos may be aligned differently .",
