    "the cell cycle  biomass accumulation , dna replication and cell division  is at the heart of life .",
    "disruptions in this cycling , due to environmental changes or genetic defects , can lead to cell death or to uncontrolled proliferation such as in tumorigenesis  @xcite .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the cell cycle is tightly controlled in all organisms , allowing a stereotyped sequence of events to progress in an orderly and timely fashion .",
    "various molecular types participate in this orderly progress , but each species has its own specific regulatory machinery  @xcite .",
    "detailed investigations along with reconstructions of network interactions have allowed the building of quantitative cell cycle models based on ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , in particular for budding yeast  @xcite , fission yeast  @xcite and mammals  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical complexity of these systems is very high . to render them more comprehensible ,",
    "simplifications have been proposed while preserving most of the qualitative aspects of their dynamics  @xcite .    reducing complexity still further ,",
    "a number of authors have provided simplified models by discretising time and by replacing the continuous concentrations of molecular species by presence / absence ( binary ) variables .",
    "such a boolean approach has a long history going back to the pioneering work of kauffman  @xcite ( see also the book  @xcite and references therein ) and since then it has been used in quite a number of systems . in particular it has been applied to the cell cycle in the three previously mentioned species  @xcite with a fair amount of success .",
    "this boolean approach is complementary to that based on odes : it is much less powerful quantitatively but it allows for simpler model construction and interpretation , leading to qualitative insights into the generic aspects of regulatory rules .",
    "the present work is of a similar vein , but uses a more realistic model of molecular interactions and focuses on the topology of regulatory networks .    adjusting a dynamical model to reproduce observed cell cycle dynamics can be challenging but it is also an under - specified problem :",
    "because of the plethora of parameters , there are generally many different solutions  @xcite .",
    "certainly , nature takes advantage of this freedom , but a consequence is that related species can have quite different regulatory circuits , impeding attempts to extract common regulatory _",
    "principles_. to overcome this difficulty , we have taken an _ in silico _ approach that characterizes all possible regulatory circuits that are compatible with given cell cycle expression dynamics .",
    "this route allows us to determine which features are always or mostly present in these _ in silico _ circuits and it also makes possible more meaningful comparative studies of different biological networks .",
    "the present work builds on regulatory models developed in refs .",
    "@xcite where we revealed several consequences of toy expression constraints on network structure . here",
    ", we use the actual expression patterns found in three biological systems .",
    "our modeling of the regulatory networks uses thermodynamic considerations to describe the underlying molecular interactions .",
    "interestingly , the actual number of effective inter - molecular interactions becomes an _",
    "emergent _ feature , driven by biophysical constraints coupled to an appropriately defined fitness function mimicking the selection pressure operating in nature . based on this choice of genetic regulatory network ( grn ) modeling , we sample by markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) the space of all grn that provide the proper gene expression patterns .",
    "we do so for the three ensembles of grn where the gene expression profiles are taken from budding yeast , fission yeast and mammals derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . for each",
    ", we extract the structural properties of the sampled grn , from edge usage to the presence of network motifs .",
    "finally , by comparing to the case of an idealized cell cycle , we reveal an underlying common regulatory logic in which feed - forward activating cascades play a central role .",
    "this logic is apparent when the associated motifs are externally driven , but the motifs on their own do not implement autonomous dynamics .    in the next section we briefly sketch the main aspects of our model , stressing the changes from our previous work  @xcite to deal with new aspects of the problem . in section",
    "iii we present our results .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "in previous work  @xcite we developed a biophysical framework for modeling the regulatory interactions between a transcription factor ( tf ) and its dna binding site . for cell cycling systems , a number of the actors , such as cyclins , are not tfs , so our previous framework must be generalized .",
    "the starting point is a network whose nodes and edges refer to molecules and activation / repression processes , be - they transcriptional , post - transcriptional , translational or post - translational .",
    "all interactions involve specific binding sites or surfaces that allow two molecules to physically establish contact and bind through the addition of small forces .",
    "almost all of the facing elements ( atoms , bases , amino acids , ... ) have to `` match '' for the two molecules to bind .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider that each of the facing regions is specified by an ordered lists of symbols that can be thought of as a string or a table characterizing that type of molecule and its site or surface dedicated to that binding partner . then the mutual binding energy of two molecules is taken to be additive in the number of mismatches between their strings , each mismatch contributing a penalty @xmath0 .",
    "such a framework is easily justified for tf - dna binding energies and leads to a thermodynamic formula for the probability of occupation of a given dna binding site in the presence of @xmath1 tfs of type @xmath2  @xcite : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the number of tf - dna mismatches .",
    "the derivation of eq.([eq : proboccupy ] ) in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that it is of rather general validity , so we shall apply it to all of the molecular species in our cell cycle system .",
    "note that @xmath5 depends strongly on @xmath4 and is appreciable only when @xmath4 is small . with a realistic choice of model parameters ,",
    "a small @xmath4 is _ a priori _ very unprobable , so that a functional molecular contact is also very unprobable .      refs .",
    "@xcite considered _ transcriptional _ regulation ; we have to generalize the framework to any kind of regulation because of the different molecular types driving the cell cycle .",
    "let @xmath6 $ ] ( @xmath7 ) denote the average level of expression of the molecular species @xmath2 at time @xmath8 , normalized by its maximum value . the @xmath9 expression levels @xmath10 will be referred to as the _ phenotype _ at time @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in processes of the type @xmath11 that must reproduce as well as possible a target cell cycle sequence , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sequence deduced from experimental measurements .",
    "for example , in the case of the fission yeast _ s. pombe _ , this sequence pattern is given in table [ tab : pmb ] as specified in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".the cell cycle expression profiles of fission yeast ( from  @xcite ) .",
    "time runs from the top to the bottom .",
    "successive , idealized expression levels , are either 0 or 1 , at each time step .",
    "we keep the terminology from  @xcite : the initial state s expression is given by the first line of the table ( referred to as a `` start '' state ) and the last state is a fixed point associated with the cell size check point .",
    "when a critical cell size is reached , a signal ( implemented by having a so - called `` start '' node turn on ) triggers the cycle again .",
    "the cdc2 ( cdc2 * ) stands for cdc2/cdc13 ( cdc2/cdc13 * ) , where the * sign indicates the highly activated form of the complex  @xcite .",
    "similarly wee1 stands for the wee1/mik1 kinases . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the pattern of edge usage obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq_yst ] depends on the order of the genes .",
    "the order we chose makes the successive expression states resemble as much as possible a left to right shifting block of 1 s . as is visible in table  [ tab : pmb ] ,",
    "even with this `` best '' choice , irregularities remain , suggesting one consider an idealized case .",
    "we thus replaced the irregular shifting block by a regular one and then repeated our methodology on these idealized cell cycles .",
    "interestingly , the associated essential networks have edge usage and motifs similar to the ones previously described for the wild - type cell cycles .",
    "furthermore , the activating interactions typically form one long feed forward cascade . to illustrate this phenomenon ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : mam_grn_freq ] the most frequently found essential network when idealizing the target sequence of table  [ tab : pmb ] .",
    "all activating ( non - self ) interactions follow each other from `` start '' to the last expression state .",
    "the function of such a cascade is clear but if one extracts an associated motif , say three consecutive activating interactions , it has no autonomous dynamics . to understand the functioning of such a motif , one has to externally drive it , providing inputs and initial conditions that will initiate a `` block '' of on genes .",
    "the motif will then propagate as a cascade of falling dominoes  @xcite until the block of 1 s is pushed out and the whole region consists of 0 s .",
    "it is quite remarkable that a model , based on rather elementary thermodynamic and probabilistic principles , succeeds in reproducing much of the cell cycle network topology found in both baker s yeast and fission yeast , two highly divergent organisms .",
    "our _ in silico _ approach is based on considering all possible networks subject to the constraint that they give rise to the same gene expression patterns as the experimentally observed systems . in effect",
    ", this approach allows one to infer how network regulatory architectures are constrained by the network `` function '' . within this framework ,",
    "our modeling was able to give a good indication of the number of interactions and of the actual edges that are used in the two yeast species .",
    "we also considered higher order features such as network motifs ; this allowed us to reveal an ubiquitous design principle in the form of an activatory cascade that is realized perfectly within an idealized cell cycle and is manifest in the less regular cell cycles studied here .    however in the case of the mammalian cell cycle network",
    "our results are less impressive to say the least .",
    "as already mentioned , this is not really a surprise . in view of the simplicity of the model ,",
    "its failures are not devoid of interest : they indicate where a more sophisticated modeling is necessary .",
    "it is reassuring that the model does better for uni - cellular organisms than multi - cellular organisms which have far more levels of regulatory control ; the contrary would be suspect !    we were seeking to determine which aspects of grn structure are expected from simple modeling and arguments of a generic nature .",
    "hence , we have assumed that all interactions are a priori possible and only allowed the expression phenotype to constrain the networks .",
    "but it is clear that ignoring chemistry in a biological process is somewhat limiting and may be responsible for some of the features arising in the biological networks but not in our _ in silico _ networks .",
    "a likely candidate for this is the motif consisting of 2 mutually repressing molecular species : it is very frequent in the two yeast cell cycle networks but not in our ensembles of grn .",
    "this absence occurs in spite of the fact that for other phenotypic constraints , namely having fixed point expression patterns , our model does produce such motifs .",
    "thus it would be of interest to see the impact on our results of forbidding interactions known to be unlikely on biochemical grounds , but such a study is beyond the scope of the present work .    * acknowledgments * this work was supported by the international ph.d .",
