    "in the local universe , massive galaxies are primarily red , dead elliptical galaxies .",
    "studies have uncovered a population of massive , quiescent galaxies as early as @xmath83gyr after the big bang ( e.g. , @xcite).these galaxies are structurally very different from non - star forming galaxies in the nearby universe : quiescent galaxies with stellar mass of @xmath9 at @xmath0 are much more compact than galaxies of similar mass at @xmath10 , with effective radii a factor of @xmath83 - 5 smaller and average stellar densities a factor of @xmath8180 higher than their low - redshift counterparts ( e.g. , ) .",
    "although there can be systematic uncertainties in determining the compactness , such as underestimation of effective radii due to either low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , and radial mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath11 ) gradients , recent studies employing image stacks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and very deep individual images ( e.g. , @xcite ) have further confirmed their compactness .",
    "minor mergers may play the dominant role in causing compact @xmath0 galaxies to grow `` inside - out '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , the galaxies gradually built up their outskirts over the past @xmath810gyr while the mass within a certain core radius is nearly constant with redshift .",
    "a key issue is the structure and kinematics of the high redshift compact galaxies .",
    "the structure reflects the formation mechanism : a major merger may lead to a bulge - like , non - rotating system whereas a dissipative collapse may lead to a rapidly rotating galaxy .",
    "some @xmath0 quiescent galaxies have high ellipticity ( e.g. , van dokkum et al . 2008 , stockton et al .",
    "2008 , van der wel et al . 2011 ) but others are quite round ( van der wel et al .",
    "2011 ) , and distinguishing a population of pure disks from a population of bulges is difficult based on photometry alone for these @xmath0 quiescent galaxies .",
    "such arguments have prompted searches for nearby analogs of compact quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , stockton et al .",
    "2010 for @xmath12 - @xmath13 ; taylor et al .",
    "2010 for local galaxies ) .",
    "it turns out that compact quiescent galaxies in the local universe are very rare .",
    "selection effect alone , namely the incompleteness of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for high surface brightness nearby galaxies , can not account for this dearth ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    ", we identify a local compact galaxy from faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and describe its stellar and dynamical structure , and present it as a potential analog to compact galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "and stand out in the @xmath14-@xmath15 diagram ( figure [ sevensamurai ] ) as the only two objects with @xmath16kpc and @xmath17 km s@xmath18 in the sample of @xmath19 nearby quiescent galaxies ( faber et al .",
    "the size cut and the sigma cut is to ensure that the galaxies are dynamically comparable to those of the @xmath0 compact galaxies . we present a case study on in the context of comparison to the @xmath0 compact quiescent galaxies and discuss the less luminous in section [ discussion ] .",
    "is a nearby early - type galaxy in the group , one of the iii groups on the east side of the cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we characterize the kinematics of using the line - of - sight velocity dispersions ( losvds ) within a given aperture tabulated in @xcite , and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kinematics maps from the sauron survey archive .",
    "another key to understanding the structure of is to fully characterize its light profile out to large radii .",
    "we include wfpc2 imaging to probe the inner regions of the galaxy and deep ground - based imaging to constrain the outskirts . @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 images are retrieved from the public archive of _ hst_/wfpc2 .",
    "multiple exposures are combined using the crrej task within iraf .",
    "the total exposure time is 2140s in @xmath20 and 1120s in @xmath21 .",
    "the sky is subtracted from the pc1 chip by extrapolating from the wf chips . a very deep exposure centered on of more than 17 hr in the @xmath22 band",
    "is obtained with the ctio yale 1 m telescope using y4kcam ( left panel of figure [ images ] ) , following the observing strategy of the obey survey ( tal et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 image shows that the galaxy has a prominent stellar disk , as well as a smaller dust disk .",
    "they have been described as `` nuclear '' disks ( e.g. , van dokkum & franx 1995 ) but as we will show later : the stellar disk is prominent and extends well beyond @xmath23 effective radius of the galaxy .",
    "the morphology of the galaxy is usually given as `` e '' ( e.g. , kormendy et al . 1994 ) but this is influenced by the resolution of ground - based observations .",
    "we first ask the question whether is similarly compact as quiescent galaxies at @xmath0 , so we measure the size , velocity dispersion , and mass of it and compare them to those of high - redshift compact quiescent galaxies .",
    "first , we determine the half light radius @xmath3 from both 1d and 2d fits  the 1d algorithm provides more information about the radial variation of the structural parameters of the galaxy , which are essential in helping us to determine the inner structure of the galaxy ; while the 2d algorithm is the method used at high redshift .",
    "we run the ellipse task in iraf to fit isophotes to both the very deep ctio @xmath22 band image and the @xmath20 band _ hst_/wfpc2 image  sextractor is used to mask the crowded ctio image ; and for the @xmath20 image , we interactively mask out the centermost dust disk according to the @xmath24 map . the circularized radial surface brightness profile is shown in figure [ size ] . in the best - fit 1d srsic model ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the effective radius is @xmath25kpc where the error is dominated by the uncertainty in distance measurement @xmath26mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the srsic index is @xmath27 .",
    "our 1d size is slightly smaller than 0.51kpc by @xcite ( in @xmath28 band ) , and 0.56kpc by @xcite ( also in @xmath22 band ) , both of which are based on the same distance measurement used here .",
    "srsic index varies amongst different published measurements from 2.44 ( this work ) to 2.82 ( @xcite ) and 3.22 ( @xcite ) .",
    "galfit ( @xcite ) is a standard tool in probing the size and morphology of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we utilize this 2d fitting code for only the higher resolution @xmath20 image .",
    "a single srsic component gives @xmath29kpc and @xmath30 , which agrees well with those derived from the 1d profile .",
    "if we fit with double srsic components , the inner disk component with srsic index fixed to @xmath31 and the outer bulge component with free srsic index in order to attempt to perform a simple bulge - disk decomposition , then we get @xmath32kpc ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34kpc . taking into account the three size measurements",
    ", we will adopt @xmath2kpc and @xmath35 in the following analysis .",
    "second , we constrain the mass of . similarly to what applies to high - redshift compact quiescent galaxies , the dynamical mass is derived using size , srsic index , and line - of - sight luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion within effective radius : @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the long - slit kinematics along the major axis ( gebhardt et al . 2003 ) and fold the data in half to derive the radial losvd profile @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath14 are the first and second order gauss - hermite velocity moments .",
    "rather than applying aperture corrections we can calculate the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion within @xmath3 directly from the radial kinematic profile , which gives @xmath40 km s@xmath18 , where the error of 5% is adopted to allow for systematics .",
    "our result is slightly larger than @xmath41 km s@xmath18 ( cappellari et al .",
    "2006 ) . using @xmath2kpc and @xmath27",
    ", we get @xmath42 from equation ( [ dyn1 ] ) .",
    "stellar mass @xmath43 is derived by fitting stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models to photometric redshifts , which also constrain the stellar age , dust content , star formation timescale , metallicity , and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) consists of sdss @xmath44 and 2mass @xmath45 broadband photometries , all corrected for galactic extinction according to @xcite .",
    "we run the sps code fast ( @xcite ) with the stellar population templates by @xcite , assuming an exponentially declining star formation history , @xcite imf , and @xcite reddening law .",
    "the sed is best fit with a stellar mass of @xmath46 , with @xmath47gyr , age@xmath48gyr , sfr@xmath49yr@xmath18 , and @xmath50 , where an error of @xmath51 dex in @xmath43 is allowed to account for systematic uncertainties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we are now in a position to compare this nearby galaxy to @xmath0 quiescent galaxies . in figure",
    "[ diagrams ] we compare the sizes , masses and velocity dispersions of , high - redshift compact galaxies , and low - redshift sdss galaxies ( @xmath52 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the selection of the low - redshift sample follows @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses are all converted to the @xcite imf , and dynamical masses are all derived using equation ( [ dyn1 ] ) .",
    "generally , has obvious offsets from the low - redshift population .",
    "in particular , the very high velocity dispersion makes a prominent outlier of low - redshift galaxies in not only the @xmath5-@xmath3 diagram similar to our selection diagram but also the @xmath5-@xmath4 diagram : its velocity dispersion is a factor of @xmath82 higher than similarly massive low - redshift galaxies ; and low - redshift galaxies with similar velocity dispersion are a factor of @xmath85 larger than .",
    "is similar to the high - redshift population in terms of @xmath5-@xmath3 , @xmath5-@xmath4 , and @xmath3-@xmath4 , but seems to have a lower @xmath53 ratio .",
    "the clearest offsets from the @xmath10 data is seen in the @xmath5-@xmath3 plane .",
    "here is offset from the local relation by more than 0.5 dex in both axes .",
    "we conclude that is an analog of the recently identified population of compact , quiescent high redshift galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "a prominent central disk is already revealed in the lower right panel of figure [ images ] , and we wish to estimate the size of the disk and its contribution to the total luminosity of the galaxy quantitatively .",
    "the radius at which @xmath54 approaches an inner peak near unity is defined as the extent of the central disk @xmath55 .",
    "we use the kinematics by gebhardt et al.(2003 ) to estimate the radius and show the 2d kinematics maps from sauron survey . as shown in figure [ disk&profiles ] , @xmath56kpc is consistent with the position of the dip in the b / d profile , indicating that the disk dominate at least the inner @xmath57 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the half - light radius of the disk component found in the double - srsic fit .",
    "the range of high flatness is also within @xmath55 .",
    "the light concentration index @xmath58 defined in @xcite , is the ratio of flux inside some fraction @xmath59 of @xmath3 to the total flux inside @xmath3 . for",
    ", @xmath60 implies that the region dominated by the disk component contributes @xmath7 the total luminosity .",
    "the b / d profile also shows that the contribution to the total light from the bulge and disk is @xmath61 , and the disk contributes up to 1/3 the light within @xmath3 .",
    "the velocity map and @xmath62 map also show inner peaks and outer plateaus as revealed by the @xmath62 profile .",
    "the disk is better revealed when the model bulge component of the galaxy is subtracted from the original @xmath20 band image ( lower left panel of figure [ disk&profiles ] ) .",
    "in this work , we have illustrated the compactness of and investigated its prominent rotating disk .",
    "the size of the galaxy is unusually small given its dynamical mass , which makes it an outlier with respect to the nearby quiescent galaxies and similar to @xmath63-@xmath64 compact quiescent galaxies .",
    "we first ask whether our results might have been expected given the observed scatter in the size - mass relation in the sdss survey .",
    "we fit a size - mass relation to the sdss galaxies @xmath65 , which is consistent with shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and van de sande et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and estimated the standard deviations to this relation in 10 stellar mass bins .",
    "we find that is @xmath83@xmath14 below the local size - mass relation based on the standard deviation in size in the mass bin that it belongs to .",
    "given that the size distribution in each mass bin can be well described by a log - normal distribution ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2003 ) , we expect to find 0.54 galaxies as compact as ngc 5845 in 400 local sdss galaxies . hence , the probability of finding 1 in the faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) sample is @xmath66% , and the probability of finding 2 is @xmath67% . in other words , finding 1 or 2 of these objects in our `` backyard '' could have been expected .",
    "the presence of a rotating disk dominating the inner @xmath23 effective radius of this nearby analog suggests that such structure could also be present in high - redshift counterparts , consistent with the high flattening of some @xmath0 compact galaxies ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 , van der wel et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the question follows naturally whether this local compact quiescent galaxy is a survivor of high redshift counterparts or a newly formed analog .",
    "we approach this question in two ways : by looking at its environment and by estimating its stellar age .",
    "first , is situated in the group , the third most massive aggregate of early - type galaxies ( only after and ) in the local universe ( @xcite ) , at a distance of @xmath865kpc from the central giant elliptical galaxy ( figure [ images ] ) .",
    "interestingly , two other early - type galaxies in this group , and , are also known to be compact : mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) almost excluded together with and as group candidates in their study of group because of their relatively high surface brightness and small size .",
    "these two galaxies are even closer to the central galaxy : both are blended with the outskirts of .",
    "a similar situation exists near : is also compact in terms of size ( only @xmath80.3kpc ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath8240 km s@xmath18 , e.g. , @xcite ) . additionally , is similar to in some other aspects .",
    "they are both fast rotators : reaches @xmath68 .",
    "they both have a dust disk and stellar disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of these four galaxies to group centers and their similarities suggest that they might be tidally stripped or undergoing tidal stripping .",
    "however , stands out as a much more massive galaxy compared with the other three , and it is also further away from the group center .",
    "we also note that , the other galaxy in the faber et al . sample with @xmath16kpc and @xmath17 , also has a prominent disk ( e.g. , cretton & van den bosch 1999 ) . however , is relatively faint at @xmath69 compared to at @xmath70 , so when placed at @xmath71 it would not likely be sufficiently bright to be in samples of quiescent high redshift galaxies .",
    "second , we infer that if the stellar age of is significantly older than its high - redshift counterparts , it could have been a normal - looking quiescent galaxy ( i.e. , a descendant of a massive compact quiescent galaxy ) without tidal stripping : tidal stripping might help it retain the progenitor s structural appearance .",
    "if this is the case , we expect some imprints in metallicity .",
    "the metallicity is indeed very high for its @xmath72 : [ @xmath73/h ] @xmath74 within @xmath3 and [ @xmath59/fe ] @xmath75 ( kuntschner et al .",
    "2010 ) , in the range of giant ellipticals .",
    "if its stellar age is similar to the high - redshift compact galaxies ( @xmath760.5 - 2.5gyr ; e.g. , @xcite ) , could be at a similar evolutionary stage as the high - redshift counterparts , namely being a newly formed analog .",
    "either option , if grounded with further evidence , would be supplementary to the `` inside - out '' growth scenario . however , there are discrepancies in the stellar age estimates , with both younger results for instance , @xmath77gyr ( @xcite ) and older results @xmath78gyr ( @xcite ) , @xmath79gyr ( @xcite ) reported",
    ". our sed fitting gives @xmath83 - 8gyr , but we note that the galaxy does not have a uniform stellar population , as it is almost certainly forming stars in the central dust disk",
    ".    further complicating matters is that the galaxy also has ongoing star formation , in its central dust disk ( soria et al . 2006 ; shapiro et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this may suggest that the stellar disk is still forming , and is younger than the rest of the galaxy .",
    "if this is the case , the radial age gradient would imply a positive @xmath80 gradient , which could result in erroneous size measurements ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that detailed studies within the effective radii of compact massive galaxies are needed to establish their structure and constrain their formation histories .",
    "unfortunately , were placed at @xmath71 , its entire disk would fall within a single wfc3 pixel !",
    "progress may come from other nearby examples , or from observations of lensed high redshift galaxies .",
    "a definitive test of the structure of the @xmath0 quiescent galaxies requires the measurement of spatially resolved kinematics .",
    "this may be possible for very bright examples , although for the general population we may have to await the next generation of telescopes .",
