    "at intermediate energies of @xmath7150500  mev , hadron - induced nuclear reactions have served as a rich source of information , both to further our understanding of nuclear structure , and to illustrate how the elementary nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interaction may be modified in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true of spin observables , which often contain contributions from interferences between different pieces of the full scattering amplitude .",
    "these interferences , inaccessible through measurements of differential cross sections alone , can thus provide information about not only the magnitudes , but also the relative phases of individual terms in the transition amplitude .",
    "ideally , one would like to extract precise values for each of these ( complex ) terms in a manner which does not rely on specific model assumptions .",
    "this information , in turn , can then provide the most stringent tests of a given theoretical prediction for the hadronic process of interest .    to obtain deeper insight into the nucleon - nucleus ( @xmath9 ) interaction , several inelastic transitions",
    "have been identified as being particularly amenable to experimental investigation .",
    "the strong , isovector 1@xmath2 state in @xmath4c at an excitation energy of 15.11  mev has been extensively studied , using a variety of probes operating under a broad range of kinematic conditions . due to its @xmath10 nature , hadronic excitation of this state represents an `` unnatural parity '' transition ; consequently , this process should be particularly sensitive to the spin - dependent parts of the @xmath9 interaction , and in fact has long served as a critical test for our understanding of the @xmath11 component of the @xmath8 effective interaction @xcite . as an example , the spin observable @xmath12 , i.e. , the difference between the polarization induced in the outgoing proton and the scattering yield asymmetry that results from use of a polarized incident beam , has been investigated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "this quantity , which in a non - relativistic framework contains only interference terms between competing pieces of the transition amplitude , has been shown to be sensitive to the coupling of the nucleon spin to the bound nucleon current @xcite . in later relativistic treatments of proton - nucleus scattering @xcite , it became clear that these same nuclear current terms appear more naturally in a relativistic formalism , and are produced through the linear couplings between the upper and lower components of the bound nucleon wave function @xcite . in either description ,",
    "@xmath12 is dependent on the momentum of the nucleons inside the nucleus , and is therefore sensitive to the off - shell behavior of these nucleons , and the non - local or exchange nature of the interaction .",
    "thus , detailed comparisons of measured spin observable data to various predictions for specific nuclear transitions has traditionally been our best means of constraining theoretical models . in recent years ,",
    "though , such comparisons have raised a number of concerns , at both the experimental and theoretical ends .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite that in a direct - only plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , certain combinations of @xmath13 spin - transfer observables are directly related to individual terms in the effective @xmath8 interaction , weighted by corresponding nuclear response functions . when physical processes such as distortion of the projectile waves and knock - on exchange are included , however , it becomes less clear what these combinations of @xmath13 observables represent physically , thereby blurring any simple interpretation of these quantities . on the experimental side ,",
    "counting arguments show that even `` complete '' sets of @xmath13 spin - transfer measurements provide ( at most ) eight independent pieces of information , while a transition of the general form @xmath14 requires knowledge of @xmath15 independent quantities in order to fully specify the scattering amplitude .    to reduce this ambiguity , it is clearly desirable to establish a more direct connection between theory and experiment , such as would be obtained from a model - independent extraction of individual elements of the scattering amplitude . in so doing ,",
    "one bypasses the ` intermediate ' role played by spin observables , which represent non - trivial combinations of many of these elements .",
    "carrying out such a program , though , requires access to information beyond that provided by @xmath16 spin - transfer measurements alone .",
    "in particular , one must probe the polarization state of the ` other particle ' involved in the reaction : the recoil nucleus .",
    "this can be achieved through study of the angular correlation in the final state between the scattered ( out - going ) proton and the particle(s ) emitted in the decay of the excited nucleus , as in reactions of the type @xmath1 .",
    "more specifically , for proton excitation of a @xmath17 transition , followed by electromagnetic decay back to the ground state , it has recently been proven formally @xcite that certain @xmath18 measurements , when combined with complete sets of @xmath13 observables , allow for a complete description of the transition amplitude .",
    "note that in this case a total of @xmath19 independent quantities must be determined .    in this paper , we report the first model - independent determination of the complete transition amplitude for any nuclear final state with @xmath20 .",
    "this analysis is based on a detailed set of measurements @xcite carried out at the indiana university cyclotron facility ( iucf ) , in which both @xmath13 spin - transfer and @xmath21 coincident observables were determined simultaneously for excitation of the isovector @xmath10 state at 15.11  mev in @xmath4c .",
    "data were taken at four proton scattering angles ( @xmath5 = 5.5@xmath6 , 8.8@xmath6 , 12.1@xmath6 , and 16.5@xmath6 ) at an incident proton beam energy of 200  mev . as will be shown below , this",
    "data set allows for extraction of each individual ( complex ) spin - dependent term in the transition amplitude in a model - independent manner .",
    "moreover , because this procedure has been applied at a number of scattering angles , the momentum - transfer ( @xmath22 ) dependence of each spin - operator amplitude has been mapped out , allowing for a clearer interpretation of the physical mechanisms that drive this transition .    this paper will be organized in the following way . in sec .",

    "although it has been shown formally @xcite that certain combinations of these observables can provide an analytic solution of this problem ( via matrix inversion ) , this method of analysis has several disadvantages in practice . because only particular linear combinations of the measured quantities are used , some statistical information is invariably lost in this method .",
    "of more concern is the loss of any statistical gauge of the quality or internal consistency of the amplitude extraction procedure ; because one will always obtain an ` answer , ' the assignment of errors to the @xmath34 amplitudes becomes somewhat ambiguous .    in this work ,",

    "this method not only makes use of the full statistical information contained in the data set , but also minimizes any bias that could be introduced through data manipulation ( e.g. , forming various linear combinations of the data ) prior to the actual fitting .",
    "thus , our approach can be viewed conceptually as the following : we seek values for the six complex amplitudes @xmath34 contained in eq .",

    "details of the minimization procedure we followed will be provided in the next few paragraphs , but we first point out a few subtle features unique to this problem . because the amplitudes are complex , one can seek values for either their magnitudes and phases , or for their real and imaginary components . in this work",
    ", we carried out independent fits to both parameter sets , and obtained ( as one would hope ) equivalent results .",
    "however , it became clear that when attempting to resolve various discrete ambiguities in the fitting results , or invoking arguments of ` smoothness ' ( in momentum transfer ) , use of magnitudes and phases as the fitting parameters was favored .",
    "it was also necessary to hold one phase fixed during the fitting , as the observables are insensitive to any uniform shift in all the phases . because @xmath103 was consistently one of the largest magnitudes over the entire angular range studied , we chose to define @xmath104 to be real and positive , and thus determined ( in effect ) the phase of every other @xmath34 relative to that of @xmath104 .    a final choice which required careful thought was the selection of appropriate starting values for the parameters to be fit . to avoid any bias",
    ", we noted that the form of the singles cross section , @xmath105 ( eq .  [ eq : norm ] ) , reveals that the maximum allowed value for the magnitude of any of the @xmath34 s is constrained by @xmath106 thus , the allowed parameter space for the magnitudes must be restricted to this range . in our fitting , we therefore assigned starting values for each @xmath107 by using a linear random number generator to select a number between zero and this maximum .",
    "similarly , starting values for each phase were chosen at random over the allowed range @xmath108 by holding @xmath109 at zero , then searching the 11-dimensional parameter space for minima in @xmath102 , we were able to determine the values for the @xmath34 that were most consistent with our entire 16-observable data set .",
    "we now describe the actual fitting procedure in greater detail .",

    "for example , the values obtained for the in - plane coincident cross - section coefficients , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , were deduced from the same data set by fitting sinusoidal functions to the measured photon yields .",
    "thus , the resulting coefficients of the fit are highly correlated .",
    "the minimization procedure we employed uses a combination of algorithms @xcite to locate the minima of an arbitrary , nonlinear function in an arbitrarily large parameter space .",

    "the minimization condition can be written as a matrix equation @xmath125 or @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128    the algorithm @xcite used to find the @xmath102 minimum utilizes a gradient search in the early stages of the fitting process , which transforms smoothly into a linearization of the fitting function as the fit converges .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a parameter @xmath129 which sets the scale for the size of steps taken along the gradient .",
    "to do so , the diagonal elements of the curvature matrix @xmath65 defined above are modified according to @xmath130 upon inspection of this equation , we note that if @xmath131 , then @xmath132 and the search is approximately a gradient search . if , on the other hand , @xmath133 , then @xmath134 and so the function @xmath102 is ( approximately ) linearized , as described in eqs .",
    "[ eq : linchi ] and [ eq : mincond ] .",
    "the algorithm is designed such that the closer @xmath135 gets to a minimum ( determined by the size of the changes in the fitting parameters required to ` step across ' the minimum ) , the smaller the value of @xmath129 chosen , and thus a transition from a gradient search to a linearization of @xmath102 is effected .    at each scattering angle ,",
    "a total of 10,000 randomly chosen sets of the @xmath119 s were used as starting points to this algorithm .",
    "approximately 95% of the time , the algorithm was successful and converged on a minimum in the multi - dimensional @xmath102 surface .",
    "it quickly became clear , however , that the @xmath102 function describing these observables contained many local minima , and the fit would often become ` trapped ' in these shallower regions , rather than converging on the ` true ' minimum value , @xmath136 .",

    "nevertheless , this yielded a sample of roughly 1000 sets of amplitudes at each angle which gave reasonably good descriptions of all 16 measured observables .",
    "the procedures used to extract final values for each spin - operator amplitude will be presented in the next section . for now , we note that within these 1000 or so acceptable solutions , the _ magnitudes _ of the amplitudes , @xmath107 , were generally found to be very stable , and largely independent of the choice of starting parameters .",
    "the values found for the corresponding _ phases _ , @xmath139 , on the other hand , were highly dependent on the starting parameters , and thus exhibited much larger fit - to - fit variations .",
    "based on this , a second round of fitting was undertaken , in which the starting parameters were _ not _ chosen at random : in this analysis , the magnitudes were initially set to their best - fit values , as determined from the first round of fitting , while the phases were each stepped through all allowed values in a multi - dimensional grid search . specifically , each phase was assigned a starting value between 0 and @xmath140 in steps of @xmath141 , with all possible combinations used as starting sets .    as a final check on the robustness of the entire fitting procedure",

    "after performing 10,000 fits to the data at each scattering angle , our next step was to try to converge on a unique set of solutions for the @xmath34 s . at each angle",
    ", we first discarded all fits in which the resulting @xmath102 minimum , @xmath137 , was more than twice the lowest value found , @xmath136 . for the number of degrees of freedom in our fitting function , this provided a confidence level of 85% that the true solution was included among the 1000 or so fits kept at each angle @xcite . among these 1000 fits , though , the solutions tended to cluster tightly around a very small number of regions in parameter space , yielding a set of roughly 510 distinct solutions for each angle . as mentioned previously , the amplitudes extracted from these different solutions were often quite similar in magnitude , but showed discrete ( and correlated ) variations in phase .    to proceed further , i.e. , to select from among these few distinct sets of solutions , it was necessary to introduce additional assumptions concerning the angle dependence of the amplitudes . by imposing the constraint that the amplitudes vary slowly and smoothly as a function of momentum transfer (",
    "as do all the observables described by these amplitudes ) , we were able to eliminate most of the remaining ambiguities in the values determined for the @xmath34 s .",
    "we will illustrate this procedure with examples below . before invoking such arguments",
    ", it is important to note that as the magnitude of a complex quantity goes through a minimum , both the real _ and _ the imaginary components must pass close to zero ; hence the phase will typically change by roughly 180@xmath6 as one passes through this minimum .",
    "conversely , it is difficult to produce such a large phase shift _ unless _ a magnitude becomes very small .",
    "we now examine in detail the two amplitudes @xmath104 and @xmath143 . shown in fig",
    ".  1 are the fitted magnitudes and the relative phase of these two amplitudes , each plotted versus the center - of - mass scattering angle .",
    "( for plotting purposes , all phases lie in the range @xmath144 . )",
    "different plotting symbols at each angle correspond to different sets of solutions , and have been displaced slightly in angle .",
    "the magnitudes of both @xmath104 and @xmath143 are large over the range @xmath145 for all valid solutions , and decrease smoothly with angle .",
    "the phase difference @xmath146 is close to zero everywhere _ except _ for a single solution at @xmath5 = 8.8@xmath6 , indicated by a daggered ` x ' , which is near @xmath147 . if one assumes that neither @xmath104 nor @xmath143 passes near zero in this region , then this phase , and all other fitted values associated with this solution , are almost certainly unphysical .",
    "while one could attempt to make this argument more quantitative , e.g. , by fitting the magnitudes of @xmath104 and @xmath143 with simple functions that did or did not pass near zero somewhere in this angle range , we feel that even a cursory examination of fig .  1 tends to rule out the possibility of a zero - crossing .",
    "these arguments will become even stronger ( though obviously somewhat more model - dependent ) when we compare our results to a wide range of realistic theoretical predictions for these quantities , all of which display very smooth variations over this range of momentum transfer .",
    "it is interesting to note that the three quantities presented in fig .",
    "1 largely determine the observable @xmath148 , which in the direction @xmath149 = @xmath150 = @xmath151 , @xmath152 has the value @xmath153 our measured value for this observable , being close to zero , drives the phase difference to either zero or 180@xmath6 , but supplies little additional information to the fit .",
    "constraints on the magnitudes of @xmath104 and @xmath143 , and the resolution of this 180@xmath6 phase ambiguity , must therefore be supplied by other observables , demonstrating again the advantages of a large , diverse data set .    by applying similar arguments to other @xmath34 s",
    ", we were able to eliminate most of the remaining solution sets , and arrive at a nearly ambiguity - free determination of the magnitude and phase of each amplitude at all angles .",
    "for most quantities , the few distinct solutions left were sufficiently close in value that a simple average could be taken , with errors enlarged slightly to reflect the range of solutions included .",
    "exceptions to this behavior occurred only at @xmath154 , where two of the phase differences exhibited two - fold discrete ambiguities that could not be resolved ; an interpretation for this will be given in the following section .",
    "in all cases , the final values determined for the @xmath34 magnitudes and phases were consistent with those found in the fits which yielded the lowest minimum for @xmath102 , denoted here by @xmath136 .",
    "as the final step in our analysis , the values obtained for @xmath136 were normalized to the number of degrees of freedom in the fit , to yield @xmath155 , a quantity which statistically should lie close to unity . in this work ,",
    "the values for @xmath155 at @xmath5 = 5.5@xmath6 , 8.8@xmath6 , 12.1@xmath6 , and 16.5@xmath6 were 0.75 , 2.14 , 2.17 , and 6.47 , respectively .",
    "because the fitting function should provide an accurate description of the data ( that is , one is _ not _ gauging the appropriateness of the model in this case ) , a minimum @xmath156 in substantial excess of 1 suggests an underestimate of the input error for at least part of the fitted data set . to compensate for this",
    ", the error determined in the fitting process for the magnitudes and phases of each of the @xmath34 s was artificially increased by a factor of @xmath157 .",
    "this ensures that when the extracted amplitudes are used to determine best - fit values ( with errors ) for the observables , one will reproduce the measured input data within one standard deviation , on average .",
    "thus , we believe that the errors quoted here for the magnitudes and phases of the @xmath34 s provide a realistic estimate of the true uncertainties inherent in the fits to these data .",
    "it has been shown previously @xcite that the large number of spin observables measured for this transition provides a severe test for any theoretical model . none of the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite could describe the momentum transfer dependence of all the observables over the entire range covered by the data . to determine more precisely where weaknesses lie in these models , it is useful to bring experiment ` closer ' to theory by comparing not the measured observables , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite but by comparing theoretical predictions for the @xmath34 amplitudes with values extracted directly from the data , as described here .    in this work",
    ", we will consider five different sets of predictions for the scattering amplitude . to carry out these calculations ,",
    "many details must be specified , such as : the method used to generate the distorting potential , and how well this describes the elastic scattering data ; assumptions made regarding the structure of the excited state ; the extent to which medium corrections are incorporated into the effective interaction ; the handling of exchange contributions to the interaction ; etc .",
    "here , we will examine predictions for the @xmath34 s derived from the _ same _ five models as those to which the _ observables _ were compared in ref .",
    ". extensive discussion on the content of each calculation is presented in that paper , and the interested reader is encouraged to refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail ; only fairly brief descriptions will be provided here .    of the five calculations to be shown ,",
    "all use free @xmath158-matrices for the effective interaction , and cohen - kurath matrix elements @xcite to specify the transition to the excited state .",
    "two are relativistic calculations in which both direct and exchange contributions are included explicitly ( drex ) @xcite .",
    "the distorting potential for the incident and outgoing projectile waves , however , is generated either `` self - consistently '' ( the same interaction that induces the @xmath159 transition is also folded with the @xmath4c ground state transition density to produce the distortions ) , or from an optical potential , with parameters fit to p+@xmath4c elastic scattering cross section and analyzing power data . in all of the figures , the predictions of these two calculations will be shown as a solid line ( self - consistent ) and a long - dashed line ( optical potential ) .",
    "two nonrelativistic calculations also include both direct and exchange contributions explicitly ( dw81 ) @xcite , and also incorporate the effects of distortion using the same two methods , i.e. , either self - consistently ( dotted line ) or from the same optical potential as was used in the relativistic calculation ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "finally , we will compare our values of the scattering amplitudes to those predicted using a relativistic calculation in which the full interaction has been parameterized in terms of direct scattering processes _ only _ , with distorted waves generated self - consistently ( short - dashed line ) .",
    "although exchange processes are expected to contribute significantly to this reaction , this last calculation appeared to describe the _ observables _ measured for this reaction better than any model in which exchange contributions",
    "had been explicitly included @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that most current methods of accounting for exchange processes are inadequate to describe proton - nucleus scattering at intermediate energies , at least for unnatural parity transitions .    before making detailed comparisons between data and theory ,",
    "there is one ambiguity which must be pointed out . because the individual spin - operator amplitudes have dimensions of @xmath160 , cross section data @xcite",
    "were used to provide an overall normalization factor for all spin observables considered in the fitting procedure .",
    "this ensures , for example , that eq .",
    "[ eq : norm ] is obeyed , and the sum of the squared amplitudes equals the measured cross section .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .  2 , the five calculations considered here do not reproduce this cross section .",
    "in particular , all of the calculations underpredict @xmath161 at small angles , except for the dw81 calculation using distortions generated in an optical model , which overpredicts the data at small angles , then decreases much more rapidly with angle than the data .",
    "the dw81 calculation which uses self - consistent distortions , on the other hand , is a much more shallow function of angle than the data suggest .    in light of these discrepancies",
    ", one could consider scaling all of the calculated magnitudes , @xmath107 , by a single multiplicative factor , in order to more closely reproduce the measured cross section .",
    "in this way , one is effectively comparing the _ relative _ sizes of the spin - operator amplitudes for each model to the measured values .",
    "this also ensures that the dominant amplitudes will be well reproduced . on the other hand",
    ", the differences observed between the predicted and measured cross sections might result from particular amplitudes ( especially the larger ones ) being grossly over- or under - predicted , while the calculated values for others are actually in close agreement with the experimentally determined values . in this case , one is best served by _ not _ applying an artificial normalization , and directly comparing data and theory for each amplitude .",
    "because our primary goal is to identify more narrowly the weaknesses in individual calculations , we have adopted the latter approach here .",
    "the potential drawback , of course , is that a calculation that is correct in all respects other than reproducing the measured cross section will systematically miss _ each _ of the extracted amplitudes by roughly the same factor .    with the above caveat in mind",
    ", we now compare the predictions of these five models for the magnitude and phase of each amplitude to the values deduced from our fits .",
    "the quantity @xmath162 , shown in fig .  3 , is the amplitude for polarizing the recoil @xmath4c nucleus along the @xmath66 direction ( perpendicular to the scattering plane ) with an unpolarized incident proton .",
    "its magnitude ( upper plot ) is predicted by each calculation to be quite weak over the entire angle range studied in this work , a feature also seen in the data .",
    "the differences among the various calculations are , in absolute terms , very small .",
    "thus , given the level of precision with which this quantity can be determined experimentally , not much useful information can be obtained from @xmath163 , other than confirming the small probability for producing this particular spin configuration . due to the small size of @xmath163 , the phase difference @xmath164 , shown in the lower half of fig .",
    "3 , exhibits a twofold discrete ambiguity at the largest scattering angle . as discussed earlier , if the magnitude of a complex amplitude passes near zero",
    ", its phase can change by nearly 180@xmath6 .",
    "our data suggest that @xmath162 passes near zero ( has a local minimum ) somewhere around @xmath5 = 16.5@xmath6 , but our measurements can not establish this unambiguously .",
    "we also note that at smaller angles the phase difference is relatively flat , in agreement with all of the calculations , although the values deduced from the data are significantly more negative ( by @xmath7 90@xmath6 ) than any of the calculations predict .",
    "in contrast to this weak amplitude , we next examine @xmath104 , shown in fig .  4 , which is the amplitude for polarizing the recoil nucleus along the @xmath66 direction when the incident proton is also polarized along @xmath66 .",
    "the data show that @xmath165 is large throughout the angular range studied , and decreases smoothly with increasing momentum transfer .",
    "all five calculations predict this general behavior , but differ significantly in strength , relative to the precision with which this quantity has been determined .",
    "it is useful to note the striking similarities between this figure and fig .  2 , the unpolarized cross section .",
    "( for a more quantitative comparison , one would need to square the results shown in fig .  4 . )",
    "just as for @xmath59 , the values of @xmath166 at small momentum transfer are underpredicted slightly by four of the calculations , and overpredicted by the dw81 calculation which uses optical model distortions .",
    "the momentum transfer dependence of the data is reasonably well described by the three relativistic calculations , but is too steep ( shallow ) for the dw81 calculations that use optical model ( self - consistent ) distortions .",
    "the inabilities of the models to reproduce this particular amplitude are thus directly reflected in the discrepancies found between the predictions and measured values for the scattering cross section .",
    "similar behavior is seen in fig .",
    "5 for the other large amplitude , @xmath143 , the amplitude for polarizing the recoil nucleus along the average momentum direction using an incident proton polarized along the same direction .",
    "the measured magnitude @xmath167 ( upper plot ) , like @xmath103 , closely follows the angular dependence of the differential cross section , and decreases monotonically with @xmath5 . in this case , the three relativistic calculations _",
    "quantitatively _ describe this behavior , and agree with the data at all values of momentum transfer .",
    "the two nonrelativistic calculations , on the other hand , do very poorly , either over- or underpredicting the strength of this amplitude at small angles , and predicting angle dependences which are either too steep or too shallow , depending on the method used to generate distortions .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "5 is the phase difference @xmath168 , which is predicted by all of the calculations to be very close to zero over this entire angular range .",
    "the data support this idea , albeit with a fairly large statistical uncertainty , suggesting that the two largest amplitudes contributing to this reaction are closely matched in phase .    the third `` diagonal '' amplitude , @xmath169 , has some intriguing properties .",
    "@xmath169 is the amplitude for polarizing the recoil @xmath4c nucleus along the * q * ( momentum transfer ) direction , with the proton also polarized along * q * , i.e. , this amplitude is associated with the spin - operator combination @xmath170*q*)(@xmath171*q * ) . in a meson - exchange formulation of @xmath8 scattering @xcite",
    ", the one - pion exchange amplitude is associated with the spin - operator @xmath172*q*)(@xmath173*q * ) , which is very similar .",
    "perhaps of more significance , in a relativistic pwia , @xmath169 is the only amplitude that contains contributions from the pseudovector invariant @xmath8 amplitude , which carries the same quantum numbers as the pion . because the excitation of the 15.11  mev state is a @xmath174 transition , one-@xmath175 and one-@xmath176 exchange",
    "should dominate the reaction process .",
    "the potentials for @xmath175 and @xmath176 exchange interfere constructively at very small momentum transfer , but the one-@xmath175 exchange term changes sign relative to one-@xmath176 exchange at relatively low momentum transfer @xcite , which can lead to large cancellations .",
    "thus , a zero crossing in the @xmath169 amplitude may be a direct reflection of @xmath177 interference in the reaction mechanism for this transition .",
    "inspection of the extracted values for the magnitude and phase of @xmath169 , plotted in fig .",
    "6 , clearly indicates that this amplitude does indeed cross zero somewhere between @xmath5 = 5.5@xmath6 and 12.1@xmath6 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath178 , which exhibits a very different @xmath22 dependence than either @xmath166 or @xmath167 , is very well described by all of the relativistic calculations , which each predict a zero crossing somewhere near @xmath179 .",
    "the data are not described quite as well by the nonrelativistic calculation which uses self - consistently generated distortions , and are in strong disagreement with the other dw81 calculation .",
    "the large experimental uncertainty in the phase difference at @xmath5 = 8.8@xmath6 supports the idea that a zero crossing occurs near this point .",
    "the two relativistic calculations which have distortions generated self - consistently describe the momentum transfer dependence of both the magnitude and phase of @xmath169 quite well , and thus best describe the physics contained in this amplitude .",
    "the last two amplitudes , the off - diagonal terms @xmath180 and @xmath181 , are also intriguing .",
    "physically , they represent the amplitudes for polarizing the recoil @xmath4c nucleus along either the * k * or * q * direction when the proton probe is polarized along either the * q * or * k * direction , respectively . in a nonrelativistic pwia ,",
    "these two amplitudes should be identically zero for this transition , and only become non - zero if non - local effects , such as knock - on exchange , are explicitly included @xcite . in a relativistic formulation ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath180 and @xmath181 include contributions due to linear couplings between the upper and lower components of the bound nucleon wave function , even in pwia . because the lower components are momentum - dependent , the nucleon is manifestly off - shell , and non - local effects arise `` naturally . ''",
    "formally , @xmath180 and @xmath181 are proportional to the tensor and axial vector pieces of the invariant @xmath8 amplitude , respectively . by carrying out the spin algebra @xcite ,",
    "these can be written in terms of the composite spin - convection current amplitudes @xmath182 and @xmath183 , again respectively .",
    "thus , these two amplitudes should be sensitive to the off - shell behavior of the nucleons inside the @xmath4c nucleus .    in fig .  7",
    ", we see that the extracted magnitude of @xmath180 is significantly smaller than all of the predicted values , especially at small angles .",
    "this suggests a quenching of the tensor component of the @xmath8 amplitude within the nucleus , though one can not tell if this is a nuclear structure or an interaction effect .",
    "it is very curious that the only relativistic calculation that does _ not _ include exchange ( short - dashed line ) also predicts the largest magnitude for an amplitude that , at least nonrelativistically , is driven largely by exchange contributions .",
    "unfortunately , little insight is provided by the phase difference , @xmath184 .",
    "note , however , that if the phase found at the largest angle is simply shifted by 360@xmath6 , the general shape of the angular dependence of the phase difference is followed reasonably well by three of the calculations , albeit with a @xmath185 offset .    in striking contrast , the other off - diagonal amplitude , @xmath181 ,",
    "is predicted to be somewhat smaller than @xmath180 over most of this angle range , while the experimentally determined values are seen in fig .",
    "8 to be quite a bit larger .",
    "only the dwia calculation using optical model distortions is consistent with the typical strength suggested by the data .",
    "figure  8 also shows , though , that the limited statistical precision with which this amplitude has been determined makes it difficult to draw any conclusions about the momentum transfer dependence of this quantity .",
    "this limitation is also evident in the phase difference , in which a tight clustering about zero is broken only at the largest angle , where a two - fold discrete ambiguity is observed at @xmath186 . as was the case for @xmath162 ,",
    "our statistical accuracy is such that we can not determine experimentally whether this amplitude is crossing zero in this angle regime or not .",
    "two calculations predict amplitudes that , in the complex plane , pass near zero on one side ( @xmath187 ) , two pass on the other side ( @xmath147 ) , and one phase remains constant .",
    "all of these possibilities are consistent with one of the allowed solutions extracted from the data .",
    "we have made a model - independent determination of the full transition amplitude for the @xmath4c@xmath188c@xmath189 ( 15.11  mev , 1@xmath2 , @xmath190 ) reaction at an incident beam energy of 200  mev at four scattering angles .",
    "this represents the first such determination for any hadron - induced nuclear transition other than those with @xmath191 . by imposing only loose `` smoothness '' constraints on the momentum transfer dependence of the individual spin - operator amplitudes",
    ", we have performed a nearly ambiguity - free extraction of these quantities , which has provided deeper insight into the physics driving this transition .",
    "as expected theoretically , the two diagonal spin - operator amplitudes @xmath104 and @xmath143 were found to be the dominant amplitudes over the entire momentum transfer range studied .",
    "each of these was better described by the three calculations carried out in relativistic frameworks than by the two nonrelativistic calculations we considered . the third diagonal amplitude , @xmath169 , which has a spin - operator structure similar to that of one - pion exchange , exhibited behavior characteristic of a `` zero crossing . ''",
    "the value of momentum transfer at which this occurred was again much better matched by the relativistic calculations than the dwia predictions .",
    "this crossing has physical significance in that it may reflect interference between @xmath175 and @xmath176 exchange , and hence may serve as a gauge of the relative strengths of these two contributions within the nuclear medium .    the three off - diagonal amplitudes are all much weaker than the three just discussed , and as such were determined with much larger experimental uncertainties .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath162 amplitude provided little insight , though the phase was consistently ( i.e. , at all angles ) off by about @xmath192 relative to most of the predicted values .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath180 and @xmath181 are expected to be sensitive to the off - shell behavior of the nucleons inside the @xmath4c nucleus , and should therefore probe the non - local or exchange nature of the scattering process . despite the sizable errors on the experimentally determined values for these two amplitudes , neither are described well by any of the five calculations considered here , which may indicate problems in our present treatment of non - local effects in both relativistic and non - relativistic frameworks .",
    "we thank those who participated in the experiment from which the observables discussed here were obtained .",
    "we also thank j.  piekarewicz and j.  r.  shepard for providing us with the calculations and for useful discussions ."
