    "despite large observational efforts during recent years in both wide field and targeted searches for very cold brown dwarfs , the number of such objects known so far remains extremely small .",
    "since 1995 , and until june 1999 , the only genuine one identified was  ( nakajima @xcite , oppenheimer @xcite ) , the coolest substellar object known , with a temperature below 1000 k , a mass in the range 20 - 50 m@xmath1 ( jupiter mass ) , and an age in the range 0.5 - 1 gyr . a second object of this class , , has been discovered recently in the sloan digital sky survey ( strauss @xcite ) , after identification from the survey database by its unusual red color .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of this object in the visible with the apache point 3.5 m telescope and in the ir with ukirt identified it as a methane brown dwarf like .",
    "a couple of similar objects have since then been identified ( tzetanov , private communication ) from the sdss survey . at almost the same time , 4 other similar objects were identified from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) ( burgasser @xcite ) , and confirmed as methane brown dwarfs from visible spectroscopy at palomar and ir spectroscopy at keck .    in this paper we report our discovery of a new methane brown dwarf in the ntt deep field , a small area of the sky that was the target of very deep exposures in the visible and the near - infrared using the susi and sofi instruments at the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) ( arnouts @xcite , saracco @xcite ) .",
    "one object , , stands out in these images for its very red ( i - j ) @xmath2 6 color index .",
    "however , it is very blue at longer wavelengths , with ( j - ks ) = -0.15 .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy with sofi , and with isaac at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , has confirmed the remarkable similarity of this object to . the powerful combinations ntt / sofi and vlt / isaac made the observations reported here possible , in spite of the faint apparent magnitude of .",
    "although the raw s / n is limited ( 1 to 2 per pixel , 5 to 10 after rebinning ) , our results secure the identification of  as a new field methane brown dwarf .",
    "the ntt deep field covers an area of  2.3 @xmath3 2.3 arcminutes in the visible down to ab magnitude limits of 27.2 , 27.0 , 26.7 and 26.3 in b , v , r , and i , and 5 @xmath3 5 arcminutes in the ir down to magnitude limits of 24.6 and 22.8 in j and ks .",
    "the entire dataset of the ntt deep field project , primarily targeted to the study of faint galaxy populations , as well as a detailed information on data acquisition and reduction , are publicly available at http://www.eso.org .",
    "j and i band images of the field containing  are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "after identification of  from its unusual extremely red colour ( i - j ) in april 98 , we carried out spectroscopy with sofi at the ntt using target of opportunity time on 30 june - 1 july 1998 .",
    "the spectrum , covering the range 0.95 - 1.65 microns ( dispersion : 7 @xmath4 per pixel ) , was obtained under non - photometric conditions using a 1@xmath5 slit , and nodding along the slit between two positions , for a total effective on - target integration time of 84 minutes .",
    "spectrophotometric calibration and removal of telluric features was achieved using the observation of a b9 type star .",
    "the spectrum was scaled to match the ir photometry in the j filter .",
    "the spectrum shows clear h@xmath6o absorptions , leaving peaks in the spectrum at 1.05 and 1.27 ( the latter peak at a s / n of  1 - 1.5 per pixel ) , and a marginally significant detection of a third peak at 1.57 .",
    "we subsequently obtained spectroscopy of  with isaac at the vlt in the h and k bands .",
    "all the isaac observations were made with a 1@xmath5 slit and nodding along the slit .",
    "the k observations were carried out during the nights of 6 and 9 february 1999 , for a total amount of time of 1 hour .",
    "we used the low resolution grating in second order providing a dispersion per pixel of 7 @xmath4 .",
    "spectrophotometric calibration was achieved from the observation of a b6 type star observed on a different night .",
    "the signal to noise per pixel is below 1 on the peak at 2.1 .",
    "the observations in h were carried out during the night of 23 march 1999 , again for a total integration time of 1 hour .",
    "we used the same low resolution grating in third order , providing a dispersion per pixel of 4.7 @xmath4 .",
    "spectrophotometric calibration was achieved from the observation of a b8 type star .",
    "the spectrum was arbitrarily scaled so as to correspond to an h magnitude of 20.3 .",
    "this scaling proved to properly match the sofi spectrum .",
    "the signal to noise ratio per pixel is @xmath0 2 on the peak at 1.57 .    the combined , flux calibrated , spectrum is presented on figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , overplotted with the spectrum of  for reference ( geballe @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitudes , or magnitude lower limits of  are given in table  [ tab : mag ] .",
    "these values are much lower than the 1% probability one would expect for a volume density of 0.01 per cubic parsec , suggesting that a negative slope much steeper than -1.5 would be required for the imf to fit with the observed density .    one of the most remarkable features of these objects is the huge i - j color index which make them difficult to find using visible data alone . despite the spectacular success of the sloan digital sky survey which has led to the discovery of , the main avenue for unveiling in a systematic way this new population of methane brown dwarfs is to resort to combined visible ( i ) and ir ( j and h or j and ks ) deep observations , as demonstrated by the 2mass discoveries and by the present work .",
    "it is interesting to note that the denis survey ( delfosse @xcite ) did not detect so far such methane brown dwarfs , which might be explained by the relatively low detection limit in ks ( 13.5 ) . with a volume density of 0.01 per cubic parsec , the chance of finding a methane brown dwarf brighter than this limit is @xmath0 1 over the whole sky ."
