    "a precise experiment recently performed at jlab , with longitudinally polarized electrons and measurement of the polarization of the outgoing proton @xcite , @xmath12 , showed that the ratio between the electric and the magnetic proton form factors , @xmath13 , strongly deviates from unity , as the momentum transfer @xmath14 increases .",
    "this means that if one assumes that the magnetic form factor has a dipole behavior , following @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dipole form factor : @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] , then @xmath18 decreases faster than @xmath16 and @xmath19 in the measured interval . in other words ,",
    "the charge distribution inside the proton differs from the magnetic distribution , contrary to what has been currently assumed .",
    "these results evidently arise new theoretical interest to the problem of radiative corrections to polarization observables in elastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "it is well known that radiative corrections are particularly important for high resolution experiments . in case of unpolarized particles ,",
    "radiative corrections to the cross section in elastic @xmath10-scattering are usually included in the experimental data , according the calculations of mo and tsai @xcite .",
    "the size of these corrections at large momentum transfer , @xmath20 , become very important , reaching 30 - 50 @xmath21 at @xmath22 gev@xmath0 . on the other side , the effects of radiative corrections on polarization observables",
    "are only recently studied @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , in the limiting case of the soft photon approximation , the matrix element of elastic @xmath10-scattering can be factorized . in this limit",
    "all polarization phenomena can not depend on radiative corrections , which cancel exactly .",
    "the two - photon mechanism enters only as a compensation of the infrared divergency : the standard calculations of radiative corrections for @xmath23 scattering contain the contribution of two - photon exchange where most of the transferred momentum is carried by one virtual photon , while the other photon has very small momentum .",
    "but more than 30 years ago , it was observed @xcite that in the two - photon exchange mechanism , another piece of phase space , corresponding to equivalent sharing of momentum transfer between the two virtual photons , must be taken into account . and the steep decreasing of the nucleon form factors with @xmath20 results , in this case , in an essential increasing of the relative role of two - photon exchange and in the violation of the simple @xmath24-counting rule .",
    "semi - quantitative considerations have shown that such contribution must be carefully taken into consideration in the differential cross section and in polarization phenomena as well .",
    "experimental evidence of such mechanism , through its interference with the main one - photon exchange , has been searched in a model independent re - analysis of the recent @xmath25 elastic scattering data at relatively large momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the diagrams to be considered typically in any analysis of radiative corrections at the lowest order in @xmath24 are the following ( fig .",
    "1 ) :    1 .   the one - photon exchange diagram ( fig .",
    "1a ) ; 2 .",
    "the two - photon contributions ( double virtual compton scattering on the hadron a ) ( figs .",
    "1b and 1c ) ; 3 .   the bethe - heitler mechanism ( figs .",
    "1d and 1e ) ; 4 .   virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) ( fig .",
    "one expects , a priori , that the interference between these mechanisms ( more exactly between the mechanisms 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 ) plays an important role .",
    "radiative corrections to polarization phenomena in elastic @xmath10 scattering , using the standard qed technique ( bethe - heitler mechanism and infrared box ) has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and gives expected small effects .",
    "larger effects are predictable in calculations including the above two - photon exchange mechanism . such calculation , even in model - dependent form ,",
    "has to be performed .",
    "the same is correct also for the vcs contribution , which is the object of the present paper .",
    "we will consider here the process @xmath26 and calculate the contributions to the cross section and to polarization observables due to the two mechanisms described by the feynmann diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "we are interested in a specific kinematical region , concerning the effective mass of the final @xmath27-system : from threshold to the @xmath5-region at relatively large momentum transfer , @xmath20 , in the space - like region , more precisely , for 1 gev@xmath28 5 gev@xmath0 . this region is particularly interesting in view of the interpretation of recent data on elastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons by protons , with measurement of the polarization of the scattered proton @xcite .",
    "the information on electromanetic form factors that can be extracted is very important for hadron electrodynamics , therefore the estimation of the radiative corrections for polarization observables in elastic @xmath10-scattering appears a necessary procedure .",
    "virtual compton scattering , @xmath26 , is an important ingredient of the complete program for the calculation of radiative corrections for @xmath10-elastic scattering described above .",
    "moreover vcs , in these specific kinematical conditions , ( i.e. large momentum transfer @xmath20 in space - like region , and at threshold values of the invariant total energy of the produced @xmath27 system , @xmath29 ) has also , by itself , an independent physical meaning .",
    "the vcs process that we consider here is a large extrapolation in @xmath20 from the real compton scattering ( with @xmath30 , but in the same region of @xmath29 ) . therefore it can be interesting for the understanding of the deformation of the relative role of two possible mechanisms for vcs , the one - pion exchange ( in the @xmath4channel ) and the @xmath5-excitation ( in the @xmath31channel ) . both corresponding electromagnetic form factors , namely @xmath32 ( for the vertex @xmath33 ) and the magnetic form factor @xmath34 ( for the vertex @xmath35 ) are experimentally well known , in the space - like region , up to relatively large momentum transfer square . but the theoretical understanding of the @xmath20 behavior of these form factors lies on a different level . the @xmath20 behavior of @xmath32 , in this @xmath20 region , has been well understood in terms of perturbative qcd @xcite : the good agreement between theory and experiment concerning this form factor is typically considered as one of the best successes of perturbative qcd .    on the contrary ,",
    "the situation with the magnetic form factor for the transition @xmath36 differs in many respects : the @xmath20 behavior deviates from the standard dipole dependence ; the helicity conservation for the vertex @xmath35 at large momentum transfer is strongly violated .",
    "recent jlab data @xcite on the process @xmath37 clearly show that , up to @xmath38 gev@xmath0 , the form factor of the m1-transition is still strongly dominating over the quadrupole ( transversal and longitudinal ) form factors , whereas helicity conservation predicts @xcite that the magnetic and electric quadrupole form factors must be comparable ( at large @xmath14 ) .",
    "note also that the @xmath20 behavior of the mesonic @xmath32 and the baryonic @xmath34 form factors are very different : the form factor for the @xmath39-vertex has essentially a monopole dependence , @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 2 gev@xmath0 ) , whereas @xmath34 is characterized by a more steep @xmath20-dependence , i.e. : @xmath42 therefore , one can expect that the relative role of @xmath43-exchange increases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "another interesting aspect of the suggested model ( based on @xmath44-exchange ) for @xmath26 is the complexity of the resulting amplitude , due to the @xmath5-contribution , which is at the origin of rich polarization phenomena .",
    "t - even polarization observables in vcs , induced by collisions of circularly polarized virtual photons with polarized proton target ( @xmath45 ) as well as induced by collisions of circularly polarized virtual photons with unpolarized proton target , but with measurement of polarization of the outgoing proton ( @xmath46 ) have to be calculated ( in the framework of a model ) as a necessary part of the program for the calculation of radiative corrections to the processes @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "evidently the longitudinally polarized electrons interact with protons through circularly polarized virtual photons .",
    "the matrix element for @xmath49exchange can be written in the following form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) are the 4-vector of polarization and the 4-momentum of virtual ( real ) photon in @xmath26 , @xmath56 is the coupling constant of @xmath57-vertex , @xmath32 is the form factor of the @xmath58-vertex with one virtual photon , @xmath59 is the pion mass . following the vector dominance model ( vdm )",
    ", the form factor @xmath32 can be parametrized in a simple way : @xmath60 where @xmath61 characterizes the decay @xmath62 .",
    "a similar approach is working also for the heavy @xmath63-meson @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 gev , is comparable to the mass of @xmath65- and @xmath66-mesons .",
    "the constant @xmath61 can be estimated from the width of @xmath62 : @xmath67 using the value @xmath68 s @xcite , one can find the following value : @xmath69 .",
    "the absolute sign of this constant can not be fixed , in this way . in principle",
    "this sign can be determined by the quark model or by qcd - considerations .",
    "the most convenient way to write the matrix element @xmath70 ( for @xmath5-excitation in s - channel ) can be realized in the cms of @xmath26 , using a 2-component formalism : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the energies of the initial and final protons in @xmath26 , which are described by the 2-component spinors @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the 3-momenta of the real and virtual photon , @xmath81 is the magnetic moment of the radiative decay @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the total width of the @xmath5-isobar .",
    "the presentation of the matrix element @xmath70 in the form ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) has the following advantages , in comparison with its relativistic invariant , i.e. the feynman formulation :    * more simple and transparent evidence of the m1 nature of the two possible electromagnetic vertexes in the @xmath31channel diagram , for @xmath26 ; * essential simplification of the resulting matrix element ; * avoiding problems with different off - mass shell effects , which enter in any relativistic description of feynman diagrams with fermionic propagators , such as contributions of states with different values of spin and parity ( virtual antibaryon contribution ) ; * the gauge invariance of @xmath70 contribution is automatically solved from both sides : for real photon ( with polarization @xmath84 ) and for the virtual photon ( with polarization @xmath85 ) ; * each part of the matrix element @xmath70 has evident physical interpretation .",
    "note that the matrix element @xmath70 describes the single multipole transition for @xmath26 , namely @xmath86 , which dominates in the @xmath87region .",
    "the quadrupole vertexes for real and virtual photons in @xmath88 and @xmath89 are negligible up to large momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "let us write the expressions which connect the radiation width @xmath90 with the transition magnetic moment @xmath91 .",
    "the starting point is the following formula for the matrix element which holds in the rest frame of @xmath5 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the energy of the final @xmath94 in @xmath95 .",
    "one finds : @xmath96 using the existing data from @xcite , concerning @xmath95 , one finds : @xmath97 .    summarizing this discussion",
    ", we can say that , in the framework of the suggested model , all important ingredients such as electromagnetic and strong coupling constants are fixed , as well as the @xmath20 behavior of both electromagnetic form factors for the vertexes @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( in the space - like region ) .",
    "however we can do the following remarks , about this model :    * in principle both diagrams ( @xmath43- and @xmath5-exchange ) must contain phenomenological form factors : @xmath100- for the @xmath101-channel and @xmath102- for the @xmath6-channel .",
    "these form factors are not well known , and their presence may play a role in the preliminary estimation of the polarization phenomena for vcs , which is the primary aim of this work .",
    "one has to take care of the fact that the introduction of such form factors , ( in any form ) can not violate the electromagnetic current conservation for @xmath26 , with respect to the real and virtual photon , as well . * the combination @xmath103 , as it was mentioned before , results in a complex matrix element , so the polarization phenomena in @xmath26 ( the t - even and the t - odd as well ) are , in principle , sizeable . * in the considered specific case of the process @xmath26 , which is of the second order in the electromagnetic constant ( i.e. without strong interaction in the initial and final states ) , the delicate problem of the possible violation of christ and lee theorem is absent @xcite .",
    "so with any relative phase phase of the matrix elements @xmath104 and @xmath70 , we can avoid the problem of the artificial violation of the t - invariance of hadronic electromagnetic interaction , which is typically present in the discussion of processes of photo- and electroproduction of mesons on nucleons .",
    "clearly the present model is well adapted also for the vcs on a neutron target , @xmath105 , with matrix element : @xmath106",
    "so , the simultaneous study of both reactions , @xmath26 and @xmath105 in principle can allow to solve an old debate concerning the absolute sign of the product of two constants , @xmath107 , which appeared in the literature concerning compton scattering 40 years ago .",
    "in the present calculation we will consider both relative signs for @xmath108- and @xmath109-contributions .",
    "this will also be indicative of the sensitivity of the observables to the @xmath110-interference phenomenum .",
    "the differential cross section for the exclusive process @xmath112 , with detection of the final electron and proton can be written in the following form , which holds for the one - photon mechanism : @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) is the energy of the initial ( final ) electron in the lab system , @xmath66 is the real photon energy in the cms of @xmath117 , @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) is the element of solid angle of the final electron ( produced real photon ) in lab ( cms ) , @xmath52 is the polarization of the virtual photon , @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the electron scattering angle in lab of the reaction @xmath112 .",
    "the combination @xmath122 describes the dedependence of the differential cross section on the longitudinal polarization @xmath123 of the initial electron ( so the helicity @xmath124 of the electron can be determined as @xmath125 ) and on the polarization @xmath126 of the proton target .",
    "let us consider unpolarized collisions , where the @xmath127 can be written in the standard form , in terms of four structure functions : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the azymuthal angle ( between the plane of electron scattering and the plane of vcs ) .",
    "the real structure functions ( sf ) @xmath130 have a dynamical origin and depend on three kinematical variables : the momentum transfer @xmath131 , the effective mass of the produced @xmath132 system , @xmath133 , and the momentum transfer @xmath51 .",
    "it is more convenient to use , instead of @xmath101 , the equivalent variable @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the production angle of the real photon ( in the cms of @xmath26 ) , with respect to the three - momentum of the virtual @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , so that @xmath138 .    in order to calculate these sf s , let us define the electromagnetic current @xmath139 for the process @xmath26 as follows : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the four - vector of the virtual photon polarization , so that @xmath142 , with the current conservation @xmath143=0 .",
    "the sfs @xmath130 are determined by the following quadratic combinations of the components of this current : @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 where the line over the products of the current components denotes the sum over the real photon polarizations .",
    "these expressions are correct in the coordinate system ( for the process @xmath26 ) where the @xmath148axis is along the three - momentum @xmath80 and the @xmath149axis is orthogonal to the reaction plane .",
    "it is important that the electromagnetic current @xmath139 in the considered model is conserved , i.e. @xmath143=0 , so we can replace the longitudinal component @xmath150 , by the time component @xmath151 , without violating the gauge invariance",
    ".    the calculation can be , therefore , performed analytically , using the following expressions for the current components : @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 with @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158,\\ ] ] @xmath159 k_{\\pi},\\ ] ] @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are : @xmath164 @xmath165 using these formula one can find relatively simple analytical expressions for the sfs @xmath130 : @xmath166 k_{\\pi}^2\\lambda,\\ ] ] @xmath167 \\right . \\left .+\\displaystyle\\frac{|\\vec q |}{e_1+m}\\left [ -q_0(1+\\cos^2\\theta)+ 2|\\vec q |\\cos\\theta \\right ] \\right \\},\\ ] ] @xmath168,\\ ] ] @xmath169 @xmath170{\\cal r}e k_{\\pi}k_{\\delta}^*\\right \\},\\ ] ] with @xmath171    as only the transversal virtual photon polarization in @xmath26 is contributing for the @xmath31channel @xmath5-excitation , the different terms which appear in the sfs @xmath130 have a transparent meaning .",
