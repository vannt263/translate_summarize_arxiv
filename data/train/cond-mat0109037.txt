    "one drawback of this method is that above a temperature @xmath200 ( cf . section   [ sec4 ] ) or when @xmath2 , it develops a spurious second order phase transition into a phase with decoupled conduction and localized electrons . in the present work we present an approach that was inspired in some of the features of the slave - boson method in the mean - field approximation and gives similar result at low temperatures , but it does not have the spurious phase transitions of that method at higher temperatures or chemical potentials , where it behaves like the cha solution .",
