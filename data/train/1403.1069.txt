    "symmetry plays a prominent role in modern physics . in many cases",
    "it enables one to simplify the analysis of the corresponding problems and very often it leads to much deeper understanding and the most elegant mathematical formulation of the corresponding physical theory . in entanglement theory",
    "@xcite the idea of symmetry was first applied by werner @xcite to construct an important family of bipartite @xmath3 quantum states which are invariant under the following local unitary operations @xmath4 for any @xmath5 , where @xmath0 denotes the group of unitary @xmath6 matrices .",
    "another family of symmetric states ( so called isotropic states ) is governed by the following invariance rule @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the complex conjugate of @xmath9 in some fixed orthonormal basis @xmath10 in @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we allow the full unitary group @xmath0 , then the only bipartite operators invariant under @xmath12 are the identity operator @xmath13 and the flip ( or swap ) operator @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the only bipartite operators invariant under @xmath16 are the identity operator invariant @xmath13 and the rank-1 projector onto the maximally entangled state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "one finds the following formulae for the werner state @xmath19 and isotropic state @xmath20 respectively .",
    "remarkably , the properties of these two families of bipartite symmetric states are fully controlled by the operation of partial transposition : both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are separable iff they are ppt , i.e. i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 for werner and isotropic state , respectively ( a bipartite state @xmath25 is ppt if its partial transposition @xmath26 defines a positive operator ) .",
    "this example shows how symmetry simplifies separability problem in the entanglement theory .",
    "a general separability problem is much harder and the classification of states of a composite quantum system is very subtle @xcite .",
    "let us recall that the most general approach to characterize quantum entanglement uses a notion of an entanglement witness . a hermitian operator @xmath27 in acting in @xmath28 is block - positive if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , a positive operator is necessarily block - positive but the converse needs not be true . an entanglement witness ( a notion introduced by terhal @xcite ) is a block - positive operator which is not positive , i.e. it possesses at least one negative eigenvalue ( see a recent review @xcite for detailed presentation ) .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that any entangled state can be detected by some entanglement witness and hence the knowledge of witnesses enables us to perform full classification of states of composite quantum systems : a state @xmath25 living in @xmath28 is entangled iff there is an entanglement witness @xmath27 such that @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "an entanglement witness @xmath27 is optimal @xcite if there is no other witness which detects more entangled states than @xmath27 . in the class of @xmath33-invariant ews an optimal witness",
    "is provided by a flip operator @xmath34 similarly , an optimal @xmath35-invariant ew is provided by @xmath36 one easily finds that a werner state @xmath37 is entangled iff @xmath38 and similarly an isotropic state @xmath39 is entangled iff @xmath40 . both witnesses and are decomposable , i.e. @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denotes a partial transposition of @xmath44 .",
    "decomposable ews can not detect ppt entangled states .",
    "it should be stressed there is no universal method to construct an indecomposable ew which can be used to detect ppt entangled states .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that define a bigger class of symmetric states and entanglement witnesses one has to restrict the local symmetry from the full unitary group @xmath0 to one of its subgroups . in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath45-invariant bipartite operators in @xmath46 , where @xmath47 defines a subgroup of @xmath0 . within a class of such @xmath45-invariant operators we provide a detailed analysis of entanglement witnesses .",
    "remarkably , a generic ew from this class in indecomposable and hence it may serve as a detector of bound entanglement . the paper provides a geometric perspective for some aspects of the entanglement theory and an interesting interplay between group theory and block - positive operators in @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider the following subgroup @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note , that @xmath51 is a maximal commutative subgroup of @xmath0 ( @xmath52-dimensional torus parameterized by angles @xmath53 ) .",

    "interestingly , its commutant , that is , an algebra of @xmath66-invariant operators is spanned by @xmath68 and hence any @xmath66-invariant operator has the following form @xmath69 note , that defines a hermitian operator iff @xmath70 denote by @xmath71 generalized bell states in @xmath2 @xmath72 and let @xmath73 be the corresponding rank-1 projectors .",
    "one easily shows that @xmath74 span the entire commutant of @xmath66 and hence any @xmath66-invariant operator is bell diagonal , that is , it can be represented as follows @xmath75 one easily finds    [ li ] a hermitian @xmath76-invariant operator is @xmath66-invariant if the matrix @xmath77 is circulant , that is , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "similarly ,    [ lii ] a hermitian @xmath80-invariant operator is @xmath81-invariant if the matrix @xmath82 has the following structure @xmath83 where ` @xmath84 ' is an arbitrary real parameter and the vector @xmath85 is defined as follows @xmath86 that is , it is a discrete fourier transform of a real vector @xmath87 .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that two representations and are complementary to each other .",
    "now , combining and we obtain the following formula for a spectral resolution of any @xmath81-invariant bell diagonal operator @xmath88 where @xmath89 now , if represents an ew then necessarily @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 . from now on we fix @xmath93 . clearly , these conditions are necessary but not sufficient .",
    "we pose the following question : what are the additional properties of @xmath94 which guarantee that the formula provides a legitimate entanglement witness .",

    "the class of witnesses @xmath97 : =   ( \\alpha_0 + 1 ) \\pi_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1 } \\alpha_k \\pi_k - n p^+_n   \\ , \\ ] ] seems to be very special , however , it turns out that many ews considered in the literature belong to this class .",
    "due to the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism any entanglement witness @xmath27 in @xmath46 corresponds to a positive map @xmath98 _ via _ the following relation @xmath99 the map corresponding to has the following form @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
