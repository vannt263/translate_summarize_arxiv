    "the nature of the dark matter in the universe is a question of great interest for particle physics since the successful standard model has no candidate with the right properties to qualify as one .",
    "it is , therefore , hoped that determining the properties of the dark matter particle can provide important information about the nature of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one intriguing candidate that has been discussed in literature is a stable massive strongly interacting neutral particle ( simp)@xcite . such particles arise in many gauge models@xcite , and their existence is of interest even if they do not constitute dark matter . while there already exist several severe constraints from cosmology and astrophysics on these particles,@xcite they can still be viable if their strong interaction parameters are appropriately chosen .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore all possible avenues to `` tighten the noose '' on them . in this paper",
    "we discuss two experiments of interest in this connection .    the essential property of the simps ( henceforth denoted as @xmath2 ) that determines their possible experimental signature is the nature of their interaction with ordinary nucleons .",
    "it is not easy to guess the interactions of such unknown particles ; however , we have some guide from nucleon - hyperon interactions . in addition , as detailed in section  ii , we make use of an approximate relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . furthermore , cosmology provides a lower bound on @xmath4 . in considering binding of @xmath2 in nuclei",
    ", we will assume the xn potential to be attractive at low energies , as should be the case whenever @xmath5 scattering is a result of two particle exchange.@xcite    in a recent publication@xcite two of us ( rnm and vlt ) investigated constraints on simps from searches for anomalous nuclei containing them .",
    "we considered two cases .",
    "first we built on the work of dicus and teplitz,@xcite assuming that the depth of binding potential @xmath6 is of the order of a few mev s , as is the case for the @xmath7 particles .",
    "that work showed that the anomalous nucleus @xmath8 would be formed during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) if the @xmath2-@xmath9 potential is attractive and large enough ( _ i.e. _ , 10mev or more ) for x - binding in light nuclei . using a plausible model for the @xmath10 annihilation cross section , ref .",
    "@xcite estimated that the concentration of the @xmath2 particles relative to the baryons must be bigger than @xmath11 , which then leads to a concentration of @xmath12 in the present universe which is several orders of magnitude higher than the present upper limits on anomalous @xmath13 obtained in experiments by hemmick _",
    "et al._@xcite    second , reference  @xcite pointed out that , for a given attractive @xmath2-@xmath9 potential , binding is more likely in the more massive high z nuclei than in low z nuclei .",
    "this is because , by the uncertainty principle , there is less kinetic energy for the simp in the high z nucleus .",
    "we noted , however , the absence of data for anomalous nuclei with z above that of sodium ( a=23 , z=11 ) , and urged that experiments be undertaken in high z nuclei . since publication of ref.@xcite",
    ", we have been informed@xcite that one group hopes to look for anomalous gold ( a=200 , z=79 ) nuclei using accelerator mass spectrometry .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to build upon ref@xcite in two directions .",
    "first we compute @xmath2 binding and abundance in gold as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath3 .",
    "we choose gold in view of the experiment of ref . [",
    "results for other heavy nuclei will be similar .",
    "second , we make an initial estimate for detection of @xmath2-@xmath15 pairs at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  ii we estimate the abundance of anomalous gold as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath3 for the region of the @xmath16 plane for which there is binding . in section",
    "iii we consider tevatron detection .",
    "section  iv gives our conclusions .",
    "we perform two calculations in this section . first , we compute @xmath2-@xmath0 binding as a function of nucleon number @xmath0 and @xmath14 for a range of @xmath3 .",
    "second , we compute the abundance of anomalous gold , relative to normal gold , as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath3 .",
    "we consider first the nuclei in which the x - particle will bind . as in ref.@xcite and",
    "works cited therein , we take the x - a binding energy to be : @xmath17 where @xmath6 is the average x - n potential at rest , @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the x - a system , and r is the size of the nucleus in which @xmath2 is bound . we have used a simple particle in a box model .",
    "we take @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and @xmath0 is the atomic number of the nucleus .",
    "the reduced mass of the x - a system is given by the usual expression : @xmath21    the average x - n potential , @xmath6 , is defined implicitly via : @xmath22    if we take the low energy nn scattering cross section @xmath23 to be on the order of @xmath24 , use @xmath25mev , and assume @xmath26 , we can write equation ( [ bx ] ) as @xmath27 which numerically reduces to @xmath28    in figure 1 , we give the results of solving equation ( [ bx2 ] ) for three choices for @xmath3 .",
    "we determine the minimum value of a for which there is binding as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "we assume an approximate factorization hypothesis of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .    to be definite",
    ", we shall consider three values for @xmath4 .    1 .",
    "we consider @xmath31 as a lower bound .",
    "this is the minimum cross section allowed which does not overclose the universe , ( assuming @xmath32 gev ) .",
    "we use the estimate of ref.@xcite , @xmath33 3 .",
    "finally we look at the estimate of ref.@xcite , @xmath34 mb .",
    "this estimate takes @xmath2 to be the particle responsible for ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) events@xcite , the uhecron .    for case",
    "( 1 ) , the minimum @xmath4 , we see in figure  1 that gold will only capture x s for @xmath35 , ( assuming the interaction is attractive ) . for case ( 2 ) , @xmath36 , we estimate there is always binding in relatively light nuclei , in particular , much of the @xmath14 range ( 15@xmath37150 gev , roughly ) would have binding in sodium , and hence is likely ruled out by current experiments . for case ( 3 ) , the uhecron , there is binding in gold for @xmath14 above a few gev .",
    "we turn now to the less straightforward problem of estimating the abundance of anomalous gold .",
    "our first requirement is a capture scenario .",
    "two possibilities present themselves .",
    "first , the gold on earth was likely made by a supernova in the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) in which the sun was bound .",
    "gmc s live for tens of million of years , so one could assume capture in the gmc before formation with an exposure time on the order of @xmath38 years .",
    "there are complications , however .",
    "the @xmath2 needs to be slowed from the galactic virial velocity down to thermal velocities , and then captured .",
    "in addition , both the capture reaction , @xmath39 , and the dissociation reaction , @xmath40 from @xmath41 s generated by hot stars and supernova in the gmc , must be considered .",
    "there appear to be too many unknown parameters for a reliable estimate .",
    "the second , more conservative and more easily estimated scenario is to assume simp capture after formation of the earth .",
    "the key to the second scenario is that gold nuclei be close enough to the surface for galactic halo simps to reach them .",
    "geologists say , with some confidence,@xcite that there are selected gold deposits that should have had long exposure to any cosmic simps .",
    "these are deposits found at the surface of the earth , in particular , in the gravel of streams (  placer gold \" ) in regions that are sufficiently inactive geologically that one can be reasonably confident of an exposure for over @xmath42 years .",
    "the sierra nevada mountains are such a region .",
    "placer gold from the california gold rush would have a lesser exposure time , on the order of @xmath43 years .",
    "for such placer gold , the results discussed below on the abundance of anomalous gold should be decreased by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "given an exposure time of @xmath42 years , we must then calculate how deep into the earth the @xmath2 particle penetrates , and how many nuclei are in the region penetrated .",
    "we make the conservative approximation that the gold is uniformly mixed with other elements so @xmath2 can be captured by any @xmath45 .",
    "we assume all x s are captured since scattering slows them to thermal velocities .",

    "+    we now compute the fraction @xmath46 of gold that has captured an x : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the galactic halo abundance at the solar distance from the galactic center , @xmath49 is the galactic virial velocity ( 300 km ) , @xmath50 is the exposure time , @xmath51 is the fraction of the stopped x s captured in gold , and @xmath52 is the number of au nuclei ( per @xmath53 ) in the stopping length @xmath54 of x.    the fraction @xmath51 is taken to be : @xmath55 { \\frac{a_m}{a_{au } } } \\ ] ] where the @xmath56 s are concentrations by weight in the earth s crust , and we expect the capture cross to be proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "the index m designates the most abundant element with a nucleus heavier than @xmath58 .",
    "we choose @xmath59 from table i.    @xmath52 in equation ( [ frac ] ) , the number of au nuclei ( per @xmath53 ) in the stopping length @xmath54 of x , is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass of the earth , and @xmath62 gev is the mass of an ordinary nucleon .    for @xmath54",
    "we take @xmath63 \\right\\}^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the @xmath0 value for an  average nucleus , \" and the last factor @xmath65 assumes that @xmath66 scattering in the c.m .",
    "is isotropic .",
    "note , as a sanity check , that the @xmath67 factor in equation([nau ] ) cancels with that in @xmath51 , equation([fracx ] ) , as one would expect .",
    "finally , to get @xmath48 in equation([fracx ] ) we compute the primordial x freeze - out abundance , @xmath68 , precisely as specified in kolb and turner@xcite , using ( in their notation ) n=1 and g=1 , and making use of the factorization approximation relating @xmath4 to @xmath69 .",
    "we then assume that x s are concentrated in the galaxy to the same extent as baryons , but are distributed in an isothermal spherical halo of 70kpc radius .",
    "this gives @xmath70 with , the tilde denoting the cosmic average .",
    "the result of the calculation for log@xmath71 is shown with quiet drama in table 2 .",
    "@xmath3 ranges from @xmath72 ( corresponding to @xmath73 ) to 1 barn , while @xmath14 ranges from 1 gev to 1 tev .",
    "in the first column we see that the @xmath2 does not bind in gold until @xmath74 $ ] gev , which is consistent with figure  1 . as @xmath3 increases",
    ", the abundance falls because@xcite @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this fact also plays a major role in the decrease of @xmath46 as @xmath14 increases .",
    "note from the table that the boundary between binding and no - binding can be approximated by the implicit relation @xmath77 .",
    "the result of table 2 is optimistic in that previous experiments have reached abundance fractions approaching @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , it is likely to be possible to explore the entirety of the parameter space of table  2 in which there is binding of the x. for the uhecr case of ref.@xcite @xmath79gev ) , it is only necessary to go to @xmath80 , not @xmath81 .",
    "this is because table 2 shows that , even for the largest xn cross sections , if the value of @xmath14 is below 50 gev , log@xmath82 .",
    "while table  2 shows the fraction @xmath46 is a relatively smoothly varying function of @xmath69 and @xmath14 over most of the range , closer examination shows some regions of large variation .",
    "for example , the first column shows a change by 2 orders of magnitude between @xmath14=350 and 570 gev . in figure  1",
    "this corresponds to @xmath83 where @xmath58 goes from above 137 to below 137 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath59 in equation([bx2 ] ) falling from 207 ( pb ) to 137 ( ba ) which shifts @xmath84 in equation([fracx ] ) by a factor of 35 . to see this effect more clearly ,",
    "we plot in figure  2 abundance fraction @xmath46 as a function of @xmath14 for the 3 cross section choices of figure  1 .",
    "the curve for @xmath85 has a steep rise just past @xmath86 where @xmath59 in figure  2 first falls below 200 ( so that there is binding in gold ) .",
    "the discontinuous behavior at @xmath87 gev is seen clearly .",
    "the curve for @xmath88 is monotonic ( after its initial rise when binding occurs ) corresponding to the monotonic behavior of au in figure  1 for the corresponding curve .",

    "the contribution of @xmath2 to the local galactic dark matter density ( @xmath91 ) is less than 2 percent .",
    "it is important to note that we only assume that the mass density of simps is less than or equal to the dark matter constraint ; we do not assume , as did starkman _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite , that it saturates the constraint .    in summary , we see from the above discussion that : i ) we have binding in gold for @xmath92 ; ii ) a simp of mass up to a tev satisfying this condition , and having an attractive interaction with nucleons , should form anomalous gold nuclei of sufficient abundance to be seen by accelerator mass spectrometer experiments sensitive to one part in @xmath93 ; and iii ) uhecrs could be detected in an experiment with a sensitivity of one part in @xmath94 for the mass range from a few gev to their 50 gev maximum , ( assuming a target of gold with @xmath38 years exposure ) .",
    "if neutral , stable simps were actually to exist , it might be possible to produce and detect them at the tevatron .",
    "although such detection might be difficult , further study is required before one can decide whether it is impossible . in this section",
    ", we make an optimistic estimate of the most promising ranges of @xmath14 and @xmath3 for observing these simps .",
    "while the region accessible to the tevatron is quite restricted , it includes a portion of a particularly interesting region  the region relevant to the explanation of the ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecrs ) events proposed by farrar , kolb and coworkers.@xcite    we consider @xmath95 production in one of the tevatron detectors . assuming that the simp has colored constituents ( _ e.g. _ , gluon , gluino , ... ) , its pair production will be accompanied by soft hadrons . a neutral , stable simp particle will not generate a signal in the central tracker , and is unlikely to interact in the electromagnetic calorimeter of the tevatron detectors .",
    "it may , however , interact with material in the denser hadronic calorimeter .",
    "such an interaction will have kinematical characteristics that can be used to distinguish it on a statistical basis from neutron and @xmath96 interactions .",
    "the distinction is based on the assumption that at the tevatron energies , the mass of a simp represents a substantial fraction of its total energy .",
    "we then need to ask how much energy the simp is likely to deposit in the hadron calorimeter , whether we can distinguish a simp shower from that from a neutron or @xmath97 , and what overall event rate might be expected .    with regard to energy deposition in the hadron calorimeter",
    ", we make a qualitative estimate .",
    "assume that , in interacting with a nucleon in one of the steel plates , the @xmath2 loses half of its c.m .",
    "kinetic energy into particle production .",
    "we can then transform back to the lab system and estimate the energy lost by @xmath2 as a function of @xmath98 and @xmath14 .",
    "figure  3 shows the results .",
    "it has contours for energy losses ( into hadron showers ) of 10 , 20 , ... 100 gev .",
    "we see that 400 gev partons could , triggering on multiple @xmath3710 gev showers , permit discovery of simps with masses up to 60 gev .",
    "similarly 600 gev partons could push the simp discovery limit up to 100 gev . at 300 gev",
    ", we can get up to 50 gev masses , which is the upper limit , in the analysis of farrar et al @xcite , of a simp that would explain the uhecr events .",
    "if @xmath3 is too small , there will be no showers at all . in @xmath99 of steel , we get about 5 interactions for a cross section of a few @xmath100 , but only @xmath101 for our minimum @xmath3 ( @xmath102 )",
    ". we might detect one jet from the simp pair at a sufficient rate if we had a cross section on the order of at least a tenth of a millibarn , and both jets for a cross section over a millibarn .",
    "the estimate of reference  @xcite states that a cross section of more than a millibarn is needed if the simp is to reproduce the uhecr events .",
    "we estimate the production rate of simps by scaling the production rate of jets by the ratio of @xmath5 to the meson - n cross sections .",
    "we observe that the total cross section for @xmath103 and @xmath104 scattering is approximately @xmath105 for @xmath106 of a few hundred gev , with a mild ( logarithmic ) variation with @xmath106 . with this perspective",
    ", we can now turn from the @xmath50-channel @xmath107 process to the @xmath108-channel @xmath109 to estimate a scaled cross section . in the low energy region , x - production",
    "will be suppressed relative to jet production by the @xmath2 mass .",
    "however , for @xmath98 larger than a few times @xmath14 , there is no more phase space suppression , and we therefore expect scaling to work well ( for @xmath110gev ) in the region @xmath111 .",
    "the cross section for producing jets with @xmath112 is @xmath113 .",
    "this gives @xmath114 for any one quark ( to be compared with a t - quark production cross section of @xmath115 ) , corresponding to @xmath37300 events in run  i and @xmath376000 events in run  ii .",
    "again , reference  @xcite estimates that the uhecr would need a cross section of about a tenth the meson nucleon cross section .",
    "scaling the production cross section by that amount gives a good number of events in run  ii .",
    "turning to the question of whether we would recognize a simp shower in a hadron calorimeter if we saw one , the best available discriminant would appear to be the opening angle of the shower .",
    "a pion moving transverse in the simp - nucleon c.m .",
    "system will have a laboratory angle of @xmath116 comparing a 500 gev simp with a 500 gev neutron , we see that the simp shower will be @xmath37 40 percent wider if @xmath117 .    in summary ,",
    "an optimistic scenario finds the tevatron discovery potential in the range @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "consequently , it might be possible to resolve the uhecr puzzle at fermilab .",
    "we emphasize here that , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , searches for simps in anomalous nuclei are much better carried out in high z nuclei . in such nuclei , the simp kinetic energy is minimized so that the chances of binding are maximized .",
    "table  2 shows that a proposed accelerator mass spectrometry experiment in gold is capable of discovering or eliminating simps over @xmath3780 percent of the relevant portion of the @xmath120 plane so long as the low energy x - n potential is attractive , ( the likely event).@xcite    looking for @xmath2 at the tevatron is difficult .",
    "one needs events in which there are no high energy particles at the vertex or in the electromagnetic calorimeter , but there are showers in the hadron calorimeter .",
    "the range of @xmath14 values for which the hadron calorimeter showers are sufficiently energetic goes up to 50 or 100 gev for the @xmath14 mass .",
    "the range for which the shower opening angles are sufficiently wide to distinguish them from neutron or kaon showers begins around 25 gev for the @xmath14 mass .",
