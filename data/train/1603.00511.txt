    "[ sec : intro ]    the detection by @xcite of gravitational radiation from a pair of merging massive black holes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath0 , has ushered in a new era of multi - messenger astronomy . motivated largely by the reported coincident gamma - ray burst @xcite , @xcite suggested that a single star model might have produced gw 150914 .",
    "he assumes the precursor to the collapse contains a rapidly rotating helium core of at least 65 @xmath0  ( the sum of the masses of the observed black hole pair ) that has formed as the result of a prior merger of stars in a binary system .",
    "the core rotates so rapidly that it fissions into two black holes during its collapse .",
    "the two back holes recombine emitting the observed gw .",
    "well before the gw detection , @xcite calculated an alternative , single star model for a burst of gravitational radiation accompanied by a grb , but invoked a much more massive star , 300 @xmath0 , with a 180 @xmath0  helium core .",
    "their 2d calculation was unable to directly demonstrate the fission of the collapsing core , but rotational energy and angular momentum considerations suggested that as a possible outcome .",
    "here it is shown that both of these scenarios are unlikely to produce the observed gw event .",
    "helium cores anywhere near 65 @xmath0 , and up to 133 @xmath0 , encounter the pair instability , and either pulse violently and lose mass @xcite , or explode @xcite .",
    "they do not make black holes having a total mass greater than about 40 @xmath0 . for helium cores above 133",
    "@xmath0  black hole production is indeed likely , but when reasonable estimates of magnetic torques and mass loss are included @xcite , the collapsing core contains too little angular momentum to bifurcate .",
    "any stellar channel for producing gw 150914 must therefore involve binary evolution .",
    "here it is shown that the observationally inferred masses for the merging black holes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath0 , could result from the evolution of stars of non - rotating stars of 70 and 90 @xmath0  with metallicity less than about 10% solar . if rotation is included , the inferred masses are closer to 60 and 70 @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the heavier star of each pair not only produces a black hole near 36 @xmath0 , but also makes a pulsational - pair instability supernova ( ppisn ) that ejects any low density envelope shortly before collapse , but does not unbind the system .",

    "they do not make black holes . including rotation is not likely to alter this outcome @xcite , though it does reduce the main sequence mass required to produce the helium core ( model r110 ) .",
    "two other sets of models were calculated that included rotation .",

    "the fact that gamma - ray bursts are so rare , is thus an argument that magnetic torques of a magnitude not too different from that assumed here must play a role in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "one way to give the core additional angular momentum might be to avoid the production of any red supergiant phase and invoke chemically homogeneous evolution ( che ) on the main sequence @xcite .",

    "mass loss rates are uncertain and perhaps the metallicity was even lower than 0.1 @xmath39 , so model r130c used ten times less mass loss .",

    "this is too small to produce a black hole , but that deficiency might be alleviated by taking a more massive main sequence star .",
    "more problematic is the low angular momentum in the star at death , @xmath41 erg s. while adequate to produce a disk in the outer core if a black hole formed , the angular momentum in the inner core is too little to cause fission .",

    "the characteristics of gw 150914 are unlikely to be explained by any single star model . the model before the event @xcite errs in neglecting the magnetic coupling between the rapidly rotating helium core and the nearly stationary hydrogen envelope and in neglecting mass loss .",
    "the model after the event @xcite errs in invoking an extremely rapidly rotating helium core for which there is no clear path in current stellar evolution .",

    "one of the key motivations for single star models , namely explaining the putative grb temporally coincident with gw 150914 , is not satisfied .",
    "the fermi / gbm team reported a possible transient about 0.4 s after the reported ligo burst trigger time , and lasting for about one second @xcite , though that detection is head of controversial .",
    "studies by @xcite have shown that the the grb producing jet travels significantly slower than the speed of light while inside the star that makes it .",
    "the jet has far less mass than the star it working surface , where the jet pushes aside stellar matter , moves at only about c/3 and thus takes about 10 s to exit a star with radius @xmath57 cm in the zhang study .",
    "the most optimistic model here , r150a has a radius of @xmath58 cm when it dies and a much greater density than the model studied by zhang et al .",
    "the observed grb here was a weak short one .",
    "thus it is quite unlikely that the jet would reach the surface in less than 10 s. the gw signal , on the other hand , reaches the surface in 2 s and remains forever 8 s ahead of the grb .",
    "that this exceeds the observed delay by a factor of 10 is a severe problem that should be kept in mind for future studies of coincident grbs and gw signals . a repeat of zhang s calculation using , e.g. , model r150a , would be useful to clarify the expected delay .",
    "if the star still had an envelope , there would have been no grb .",
    "alternatively , it might be possible to make a prompt grb by merging two black holes if one or both have a fossil disk @xcite .    indeed , the most likely model for gw 150914 is the one suggested beforehand .",
    "two massive stars make two black holes that , under the influence of first , a common envelope , and later , gravitational radiation , come together long after their creation .",
    "the evolution of rotating and non - rotating stars that might produce black holes with the measured masses were considered here and found to hover on the edge of the pair instability .",
    "the more massive primary especially is capable of ejecting its hydrogen envelope owing to thermonuclear pulses without binary mass transfer , though that does not preclude the transfer happening . both stars produce iron cores in hydrostatic equilibrium with masses of about 2.6 @xmath0  that collapse first to proto - neutron stars , and emit a few tenths of a solar mass in neutrinos before becoming black holes into which the rest of the core accretes . given the small mass lost , large kicks seem unlikely .    in the future",
    "it is hoped that realistic simulations of presupernova evolution in this mass range can be coupled to models for common envelope evolution to better describe the progenitor of this fascinating event .",
    "this research has been partially supported by nasa ( nnx14ah34 g ) .",

    "<S> stars with helium cores in the mass range 35 to 133 @xmath0  encounter the pair instability and either explode or pulse until the core mass is less than 40 @xmath0 , smaller than the combined mass of the observed black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of more massive helium cores is either braked by interaction with a slowly rotating hydrogen envelope , if one is present , or by mass loss , if one is not . </S>",
    "<S> the very short interval between the gw signal and the observed onset of the putative grb in gw 150914 is also too short to have come from a single star . </S>",
    "<S> a more probable model for making the gravitational radiation is the delayed merger of two black holes made by 70 and 90 @xmath0  stars in a binary system . </S>",
    "<S> the more massive component was a pulsational - pair instability supernova before making the first black hole . </S>"
