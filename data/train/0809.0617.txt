    "there is increasing evidence that our universe is presently in a state of cosmic accelerating expansion  @xcite .",
    "this result has been confirmed with observations via supernovae ia  @xcite , cosmic microwave background anisotropies  @xcite , large scale structure formation  @xcite , baryon oscillations  @xcite and weak lensing  @xcite , etc .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the universe is spatially flat and is dominated by an extra component with negative pressure , dubbed as dark energy  @xcite . in the recent years , various candidates of dark energy have been proposed .",
    "the simplest candidate is the cosmological constant  @xcite . but",
    "this scenario is plagued by the severe fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem .",
    "other possible forms of dark energy include quintessence  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , born - infeld scalars  @xcite , quintom  @xcite , tachyon field  @xcite , holographic dark energy  @xcite , and so on .",
    "additionally , the conjecture that dark energy and dark matter can be unified by using the so - called chaplygin gas ( cg ) obeying an exotic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 has been investigated in several literatures  @xcite .",
    "recently , the cg model was generalized to some possible forms  @xcite . as an alternative model ,",
    "the eos of the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg )  @xcite reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the case @xmath6 corresponds to the cg . within the framework of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology , this eos leads , after inserted into the relativistic energy conservation equation , to an energy density evolving as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an integration constant .",
    "hence , we see that at early time the energy density behaves as a dust - like matter , while at late time it behaves like a cosmological constant .",
    "so the gcg model can also be interpreted as an entangled mixture of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "this dual role is at the heart of the surprising properties of the gcg model .",
    "however , these so - called unified dark matter models have been ruled out because they produce oscillations or exponential blowup of the matter power spectrum inconsistent with observation  @xcite . but no observation so far rule out the possibility of the gcg as dark energy though it is disfavored as dark matter .",
    "in fact , the dynamical properties of the gcg have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which indicates that the eos of the gcg may cross the so - called phantom divide @xmath9 if there exists an interaction between the gcg and dark matter .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to further understand such unified dark matter models by studying another candidate for the generalization of the cg , referred to as the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg )  @xcite , which is characterized by a simple eos @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath12 are constants and @xmath5 .",
    "the attractive feature of this model is that the eos looks like that of two fluids , one obeying a perfect eos @xmath13 and the other being the gcg . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , it is easy to see that the mcg reduces to the gcg if @xmath14 and to the perfect fluid if @xmath15 . accordingly , the evolution of the energy density is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the constant of integration .",
    "thus the mcg behaves as a radiation ( when @xmath18 ) or a dust - like matter ( when @xmath14 ) at early stage , while as a cosmological constant at later stage .    as we all know",
    ", observations at the level of the solar system severely constrain non - gravitational interactions of baryons , namely , non - minimal coupling between dark energy and ordinary matter fluids is strongly restricted by the experimental tests in the solar systems  @xcite . however , since the nature of dark sectors remains unknown , it is possible to have non - gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark matter . in this paper , we study the dynamical evolution of the interacting mcg model by considering an interaction term between the mcg and cold dark matter . in our scenario , we find that there exists a stable scaling solution , which is characterized by a constant ratio of the energy densities of the mcg and cold dark matter .",
    "this provides the possibility to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "moreover , we find that the final state is determined by the parameters of the mcg , @xmath12 , @xmath11 , and the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the latter two parameters represent the transfer strength between the mcg and dark matter .",
    "interestingly , we find that the eos of the mcg @xmath19 tends to a constant , which is only determined by the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 . however , both the eos of the total cosmic fluid @xmath20 and the deceleration parameter @xmath21 tend to @xmath22 , which are independent of the choice of values for the parameters .",
    "this indicates that the cosmic doomsday is avoided and the universe enters to a de sitter phase and thus accelerates forever .",
    "further , we investigate the effect of the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the dynamical evolution of this model from the statefinder viewpoint . by our analysis , we see that the coupling cantants @xmath0 and @xmath1 play a significant role during the dynamics of the interacting mcg model .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that , we can distinguish this interacting model from other dark energy models in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "ii , we study the dynamical evolution of the interacting mcg .",
    "then we apply the statefinder diagnosis to the interacting modified chaplygin gas model for various different parameters in sec .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in our scenario , the universe contains the mcg @xmath23 ( as dark energy ) , cold dark matter @xmath24 and baryonic matter @xmath25 . for a spatially flat universe ,",
    "the friedmann equation is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hubble parameter , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the total energy density ( nature units @xmath30 is used throughout the paper ) . then differentiating the above equation with respect to cosmic time @xmath31 and using the total energy conservation equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total pressure of the background fluid",
    ", we can get the raychaudhuri equation @xmath34 in which @xmath35 represents the pressure of the mcg .",
    "we postulate that the two dark sectors interact through the interaction term @xmath36 and the baryonic matter only interacts gravitationally with the dark sectors .",
    "then the continuity equation is written as @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 clearly , @xmath36 is the rate of the energy density exchange in the dark sectors and the sign of @xmath36 determines the direction of energy transfer .",
    "a positive @xmath36 corresponds to the transfer of energy from dark energy to dark matter , while a negative @xmath36 represents the other way round . due to the unknown nature of dark sectors",
    ", there is as yet no basis in fundamental theory for a special coupling between two dark sectors . so the interaction term @xmath36 discussed currently has to be chosen in a phenomenological way  @xcite .",
    "one possible choice for the interaction term is @xmath40  @xcite , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupling constants .",
    "this form was first proposed in  @xcite and it is a more general form than those found in  @xcite , which can be obtained when @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .      to analyze the evolution of the dynamical system , we introduce the following dimensionless variables : @xmath44 accordingly , the density of the baryonic matter is determined by the friedmann constraint ( 6 ) as @xmath45 which implies that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , using these variables , the eoss of the mcg and the total cosmic fluid are respectively given by @xmath48 the sound velocity and the deceleration parameter respectively read @xmath49 note that the condition for acceleration is @xmath50 and the physically meaningful range of the sound velocity is @xmath51 . using eqs .",
    "( 6)-(11 ) , we can obtain the following autonomous system : @xmath52 + 3x(1+y),\\\\ y^{'}&=&-3[(1+c_{2})x+y+c_{1}z][-\\alpha\\frac{y}{x}+(1+\\alpha)a]+3y(1+y),\\\\ z^{'}&=&-3[-c_{2}x+(1-c_{1})z]+3z(1+y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "we set the current scale factor by @xmath54 .",
    "then the current value of @xmath55 reads @xmath56 . setting @xmath57",
    ", we can obtain the critical points @xmath58 of the autonomous system as follows :    * * point @xmath59 * :   ( @xmath60 ,  @xmath61 ,  @xmath62 ) , + * * point @xmath63 * :   ( @xmath64 ,  @xmath65 ,  @xmath66 ) , + * * point @xmath67 * :   ( @xmath68 ,  @xmath22 ,  @xmath69 ) .    here",
    "the parameter @xmath70 is defined by @xmath71 thus , we can constrain the parameters in the model under the physically meaningful conditions , namely , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . concretely",
    ", we analyze the existence conditions for these three points respectively :    @xmath74 * points @xmath59 and @xmath63 * : considering the physically meaningful range of @xmath75 , we can obtain that @xmath76 , and moreover , @xmath70 is real . together with the constraint of the sound velocity @xmath77 , namely , @xmath78 , we can conclude that the existence conditions of points @xmath59 and @xmath63 are @xmath79 , but @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "in addition , in the left plot , the @xmath154 curves are very different with various @xmath0 and the fixed @xmath1 , especially , the current values of @xmath155 are different for various values of @xmath0 . also , we can clearly see the tremendous difference between the current values @xmath139 and the @xmath143cdm fixed point , and the larger the value of @xmath0 is , the greater the `` distance '' from the current value @xmath139 to the fixed point is . on the other hand , fixing the coupling constant @xmath0 and varying @xmath1 as illustrated in the right two plots of fig.6 , we find that the @xmath154 curves are very different from each other with various @xmath1 , and the current values of @xmath155 are distinct for different values of @xmath1 . also , we can clearly see the difference between the current values @xmath139 and the @xmath143cdm fixed point , and the larger the value of @xmath1 is , the greater the `` distance '' from @xmath139 to the fixed point is . therefore , we can conclude that the statefinder diagnosis can not only discriminate the interacting mcg model with different coupling constant but also distinguish the interacting mcg model from other dark energy models .",
    "in previous sections , we have studied some physical properties of the interacting mcg model . by considering an interaction term between the mcg and cold dark matter",
    ", we study the dynamical evolution of this model and pay our attention to the final state of the universe . by our analysis",
    ", there exists a stable scaling solution , which is characterized by a constant ratio of the energy densities of the mcg and dark matter .",
    "this provides the possibility to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "furthermore , we see that the final state is determined by the parameters of the mcg @xmath12 , @xmath11 and the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the eos of the mcg , @xmath19 , tends to a constant , which is only determined by the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 . but both the eos of the total cosmic fluid @xmath20 and the deceleration parameter @xmath21 tend to @xmath22 , which are independent of the choice of values for the parameters .",
    "this indicates that the cosmic doomsday is avoided and the universe enters to a de sitter phase and thus accelerates forever .",
    "the transition from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase also depends on the mcg parameters @xmath12 , @xmath11 and the coupling constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "varying one of these four parameters and fixing the rest , we find that the the larger the variational parameter is , the smaller the transition redshift @xmath138 is , namely , the later the transition from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase is .",
    "further , we study the effect of the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the dynamical evolution of this model from the statefinder viewpoint .",
    "we clearly see that the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 play a significant role during the dynamics of the interacting mcg model .",
    "the evolution trajectories of the statefinder for the interacting mcg model not only cross the @xmath143cdm fixed point but also end at the fixed point for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , the @xmath154 curve could not traverse the scdm fixed point for any case .",
    "moreover , fixing one of the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and varying the other one , we find that the larger the variational parameter is , the greater the `` distance '' from the current value @xmath139 to the fixed point is .",
    "thus , the statefinder parameter can discriminate the interacting mcg model with different coupling constant .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that , we can distinguish this interacting model from other dark energy models in the @xmath2 plane .",
