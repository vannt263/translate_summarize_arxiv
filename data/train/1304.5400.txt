    "following the discovery in 1961 of @xmath8 meson in @xmath0 reactions , the measurements of forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath9 suggested the existence of a rho - like resonance in the @xmath2-wave amplitudes , later referred to as @xmath10 scalar meson  @xcite .",
    "the cern measurements of @xmath11 and @xmath12 on polarized targets in 1970 s cofirmed the existence of @xmath10 scalar meson .",
    "evidence for a narrow @xmath10 was found in amplitude analyses of @xmath11 at 17.2 gev / c  @xcite and in @xmath12 at 5.98 and 11.85  @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for @xmath10 came from the amplitude analysis of the itep data on @xmath7 on polarized target at 1.78 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-wave amplitudes and intensities from all these analyses are surveyed in ref .",
    "these findings were controversial because the measurements of @xmath13 at cern in 1972 found no evidence for a rho - like meson in the @xmath2-wave amplitudes  @xcite . in 2001 ,",
    "e852 collaboration at bnl reported high statistics measurements @xmath13 at 18.3 gev / c  @xcite . once again , there was no evidence for a rho - like resonance in the @xmath14 @xmath2-wave amplitudes .",
    "the resolution of the puzzle of @xmath10 resonance came from our recent high resolution amplitude analysis of the cern data on @xmath7 for dipion masses 580 - 1080 mev at low momentum transfers  @xcite where @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave amplitudes dominate .",
    "the analysis shows that the rho - like resonance in the @xmath2-wave transversity amplitudes arises entirely from the contribution of the @xmath15 resonance to the data component in the expression for the moduli of the @xmath2-wave amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath2-wave transversity amplitudes are nearly either in phase or 180@xmath16 out of phase with the resonating @xmath3-wave transversity amplitudes .",
    "these facts allow us to identify @xmath10 with @xmath15 .",
    "there is a pronounced dip at 980 mev in the moduli of @xmath3-wave amplitudes @xmath17 that is identified with @xmath18 resonance leading to @xmath6 mixing in both @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave amplitudes .",
    "a model independent determination of helicity amplitudes from the transversity amplitudes shows a @xmath15 peak in the @xmath2-wave single flip helicity amplitude @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the phase of the amplitude @xmath20 is close to the phase of @xmath15 breit - wigner amplitude  @xcite .    identifying @xmath10 with @xmath15",
    "explains why there is no rho - like resonance observed in @xmath13 since there is no @xmath3-wave amplitude in this process .",
    "however , the @xmath6 mixing appears to violate rotational and lorentz symmetry .",
    "if this symmetry were violated in strong interactions we should observe a dependence of @xmath15 width @xmath21 on its helicity @xmath22 . in our analysis",
    "@xcite we demonstrate the independence of @xmath21 on the helicity confirming the rotational and lorentz symmetry of strong interactions .",
    "this suggests that the observed @xmath6 mixing arises from a new kind of interaction independently involved in the pion creation process .",
    "the observed @xmath6 mixing can be naturally explained when we assume that the produced partial waves are not isolated spin states but interact with a common environment .",
    "we can see how this might work using the following mechanical analogy .",
    "consider a pendulum of mass @xmath23 and length @xmath24 oscillating with a natural frequency @xmath25 , and an ensemble of several other penduli with various masses @xmath26 and lengths @xmath27 .",
    "when the other penduli are isolated from the oscillating pendulum they do not oscillate .",
    "however , when all the penduli are attached to a common rod all penduli begin to oscillate with the same resonant frequency although with different amplitudes .",
    "the interaction of the penduli with a common environment - the rod - allows a resonance from one pendulum to `` leak '' into the other penduli which have different natural frequencies .",
    "similarly we can imagine that the partial waves produced in @xmath7 process interact with a quantum environment which allows resonances from one partial wave amplitude to `` leak '' into other partial wave amplitudes .",
    "then the pion creation process is no longer an isolated system but behaves as an open quantum system described by a non - unitary dynamics .",
    "a non - unitary evolution law must evolve the produced final state @xmath1 into an observed final state @xmath28 with new spin mixing partial wave amplitudes .",
    "but how do we know that such quantum environment actually exists ? and",
    "why its interaction with the @xmath29 process should lead to the @xmath6 mixing ?",
    "the basic assumption of the @xmath2-matrix theory is that the minkowski spacetime is empty .",
    "it contains no environment with which particle scattering processes could interact .",
    "in part i. of this work  @xcite we put forward a hypothesis that the physical space is not empty but contains a universal quantum environment that can interact with some particle scattering processes .",
    "the new interaction can not change the identity and the four - momenta of the final state particles produced by the @xmath2-matrix dynamics in order to leave the particle scattering dynamics open to the experimental observation .",
    "this means the new interaction must be a pure dephasing interaction that modifies phases of the amplitudes and nothing else .",
    "this is a new kind of interaction outside of the standard model .    to test our hypothesis we used unitarity of the @xmath2-matrix to obtain information on the relative phases of the measured partial wave transversity amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "unitary evolution law evolves pure initial states into pure final states .",
    "this fact implies that the relative phases are constrained to @xmath32 in a disagreement with the measured phases in all analyses of @xmath0 processes .",
    "an amplitude analysis of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave subsystem in @xmath7 assuming these unitary phases is in disagreement with the cern data on polarized target at least at @xmath33 level .",
    "we conclude that the cern measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath12 on polarized targets support the hypothesis of the existence of the quantum environment and its dephasing interaction with some particle scattering processes .",
    "if the quantum environment is to be an integral part of the nature then its dephasing interactions with particle scattering processes can not contradict standard model .",
    "the two aspects of the nature must be mutually consistent .",
    "what are the cosequences of this consistency ?",
    "the dephasing interaction evolves the produced @xmath2-matrix final state @xmath1 into an observed final state @xmath28 .",
    "the non - unitary evolution law is described by kraus representation . in this paper",
    "we show that the consistency of the pure dephasing interaction with the standard model in @xmath0 processes requires that it be a dipion spin mixing interaction . in what we call spin mixing mechanism the observed partial wave amplitudes",
    "are a unitary transform of the corresponding @xmath2-matrix partial wave amplitudes .",
    "the elements of the spin mixing matrix are forward scattering amplitudes of the partial waves with initial and final dipion spins @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "helicities are conserved in this scattering .",
    "these amplitudes are matrix elements of kraus operators describing the non - unitary interaction with the environment .",
    "the theory predicts @xmath6 mixing in the @xmath2-and @xmath3-wave amplitudes in @xmath7 . the predicted moduli and relative phases of the mixed amplitudes are in an excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the theory correctly predicts the absence of @xmath34 mixing .",
    "the spin mixing of @xmath2-matrix partial wave amplitudes to form new observable partial wave amplitudes is a new phenomenon outside of standard model and represents a genuine new physics .",
    "we discuss kraus representation and kraus operators in section ii .",
    "the non - unitary evolution of the produced final state @xmath1 into an observed final state @xmath28 is introduced in section iii . in section iv .",
    "we use the purity of the dephasing interaction to derive the form of spin mixing mechanism and define kraus partial wave helicity amplitudes which are mixtures of the @xmath2-matrix partial wave amplitudes . in section v. the requirements of lorentz symmetry , conservation of total angular momentum , @xmath3-parity and total isospin impose consistency constraints on the spin mixing mechanism and kraus helicity amplitudes . in section vi .",
    "self - consistency requirements constrain the spin mixing mechanism to a simple unitary transform of the @xmath2-matrix amplitudes . in section vii .",
    "we relate the observed effective amplitudes to the kraus amplitudes and demonstrate the conservation of probability by the dephasing intaraction .    in section viii .",
    "we discuss resonance mixing in @xmath7 below 1400 mev .",
    "we use spin mixing mechanism for the @xmath2- and @xmath3-waves to present qualitative predictions for the moduli and relative phases of the spin mixing @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave amplitudes below 1080 mev which we compare with two analyses of experimental data .",
    "section ix . reviews the determination of the dimension @xmath35 of the hilbert space of the environment . in section",
    "x. we identify the decoherence free and decohering amplitudes below 1400 mev in @xmath7 and briefly discuss our new analysis using spin mixing mechanism  @xcite . in section xi .",
    "we use coleman - mandula no - go theorem to show that the dimension @xmath36 and that the amplitudes in the decoherence free subspace must mix spins while the decohering amplitudes can not mix spins to protect the lorentz symmetry of the @xmath2-matrix .",
    "the spontaneous violation of the lorentz symmetry observed in the measured amplitudes is thus consistent with lorentz symmetry of the standard model .",
