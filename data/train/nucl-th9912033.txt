    "<S> we also discuss the sensitivity to the elementary neutron amplitudes .    </S>",

    "<S> the scattering off deuterium is not only interesting _ per _ _ se _ , but also because this loosely bound two  nucleon system can be used as a neutron target . in particular , in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that one can indeed extract the elementary @xmath1 production amplitude from a precise measurement on the deuteron . </S>",
    "<S> this was vindicated by the experiment performed at sal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at mami experiments for neutral pion electroproduction off deuterium at small photon virtualities have been untertaken and are presently being analyzed  @xcite . in this brief note </S>",
    "<S> we wish to report on first results for this process obtained in chiral perturbation theory to third order . </S>",
    "<S> we use the methodology developed by weinberg  @xcite , which relates scattering processes involving a single nucleon to nuclear scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative effects responsible for nuclear binding are accounted for using phenomenological nuclear wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> although this clearly introduces an inevitable model dependence , one can compute matrix elements using a variety of wavefunctions in order to ascertain the theoretical error induced by the off - shell behavior of different wavefunctions . here , we work to third order in the chiral expansion and consider only threshold kinematics ( i.e. the pion is produced at rest ) and thus calculate the pertinent transverse and longitudinal s  wave multipoles . while a third order computation is not sufficient for the normalization of the elementary amplitudes , the explicit calculations for @xmath0 electroproduction off the proton to fourth order let one expect that the momentum dependence of the s  wave cross section is sufficiently accurately described at the order we are working . </S>",
    "<S> this topic will be discussed in more detail below .    </S>",
    "<S> to third order ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes a small momentum or a pion mass ) in chiral perturbation theory , the s  wave neutral pion electroproduction amplitude off the deuteron can be decomposed as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the deuteron angular momentum vector , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the polarization vector and three  momentum of the virtual photon , respectively . note that in electron scattering @xmath8 . there are three multipole amplitudes at threshold , which are of the electric , magnetic and longitudinal type . </S>",
    "<S> these can be mapped onto the notation of ref.@xcite via @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in that notation , </S>",
    "<S> the upper index gives the multipolarity , whereas the lower indices denote the orbital angular and the total angular momentum of the final deuteron  pion system , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> effectively , however , one has only two combinations of these multipoles contributing at threshold , which only appear squared and are given by @xmath12 the electric dipole amplitude @xmath13 characterizes the transverse response whereas @xmath14 parameterizes the longitudinal response of the deuteron to the virtual photon . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the multipoles depend on the photon virtuality @xmath15 and the pion energy @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> . since we only consider the production threshold @xmath17 , we will not further specify this energy dependence . in analogy to what is done in the single nucleon sector </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider the deuteron s  wave cross section @xmath18 , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the longitudinal polarization for a photon with polarization @xmath21 .    as </S>",
    "<S> shown in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude obtains contributions from single scattering ( @xmath22 ) as well as the so  called three  body ( @xmath23 ) graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the single scattering contribution for the transverse and longitudinal multipoles at threshold takes the form @xmath24 + l_{0 + } \\ , s_d^3   ( k^2 ) \\,\\biggr\\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the pion , nucleon and deuteron mass , in order .  </S>",

    "<S> proton mass difference in the rescattering diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed discussion of this point i d given in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] furthermore , @xmath29 and the @xmath30 are the pertinent deuteron form factors @xmath31 in the photoproduction , one is of course only sensitive to @xmath32 , see e.g. ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 denotes the momentum space deuteron wave function . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined with respect to the total angular momentum @xmath34 and not only with respect to the deuteron spin vector @xmath35 . to properly extract the single scattering contribution </S>",
    "<S> , one has to look at the transverse and longitudinal response functions @xmath36 ( the formalism is reviewed in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the form factors @xmath30 are shown in fig.2 for photon virtualities in the range from @xmath37 to @xmath38  gev@xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> all of them exhibit a strong dependence on the photon virtuality , i.e. at @xmath40gev@xmath39 they suppress the single scattering contribution by about a factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there are two three  body contributions at third order ( see also ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding amplitudes read : @xmath41 using standard kinematical notation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath42mev is the pion decay constant , @xmath43 the axial  vector coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> this value was also used in the determination of the single scattering amplitudes , see e.g.  ref.@xcite . in any case , the difference between this value for @xmath44 and its physical value of @xmath45 is due to a dimension three @xmath46 operator , which does not occur at the order we are working . ] and @xmath47 indicates that @xmath48 is sandwiched between deuteron wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements have been evaluated using a cornucopia of wavefunctions in coordinate and momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non  trivial check on our calculations . as a further check we mention that for @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> , we recover the corrected results of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if not stated otherwise , all numbers quoted have been obtained using the bonn potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the three  body corrections turn out to be quite independent of the wavefunction used . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the chiral perturbation theory approach , which relies on the dominance of the pion  exchange , is useful in this context .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the results for the multipoles and the s  wave cross section . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the @xmath50 calculation , being aware of the fact that in particular the proton electric dipole amplitude at the photon point is not well described to that order . however , the @xmath15dependence of the elementary amplitudes on the proton and the neutron is largely given by the third order contribution   ( see the results discussed in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath50 results for @xmath13 and @xmath14 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the three  </S>",
    "<S> body contribution is sizeable . </S>",
    "<S> as in the case of photoproduction , graph  ( tb , a ) ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) totally dominates the electric dipole amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is different for the longitudinal response , where the contribution from graph  ( tb , b ) is still smaller than the one of graph  ( tb , a ) but of comparable magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that @xmath13 varies more significantly with increasing @xmath51 than @xmath14 . as illustrated by the dotted lines in fig .  3 , which have been obtained by a constant shift of the @xmath1 amplitudes by @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , there is some sensitivity to the elementary scattering off the neutron . to get a more realistic estimate for the s  wave cross section , </S>",
    "<S> we have adjusted the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 ) at the photon point to the values obtained from the fourth order calculation . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the electric dipole amplitudes are taken from ref.@xcite , the @xmath56 from the best fit obtained in ref.@xcite and the @xmath57 using the resonance saturation estimate with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as detailed in  @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for a more detailed discussion on this point ) . </S>",
    "<S> the so calculated s  wave cross section is collected in table  1 for a photon polarization @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a range , which is obtained by adding a constant shift of @xmath61 to the elementary @xmath1 longitudinal multipole ( but keeping the electric dipole amplitude at the same value as before ) . </S>",
    "<S> this serves to illustrate the sensitivity of the s  wave cross section to the so far unmeasured @xmath62 . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the s  wave cross section measured on the proton  @xcite for @xmath63gev@xmath39 lies between 0.15 and 0.45  @xmath64b . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that for @xmath40gev@xmath39 , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 the s  wave cross section for neutral pion production off the proton . </S>",
    "<S> however , the curvature of @xmath67 is rather different from the one for the proton case . </S>",
    "<S> this is partly due to the interference of the proton and neutron amplitudes and partly a kinematical effect , since for a given polarisation @xmath21 and virtuality @xmath15 , @xmath68 is larger for the proton than for the deuteron .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered neutral pion electroproduction off the deuteron at threshold using weinberg s hybrid approach of nuclear effective field theory ( i.e. using weinberg s chiral counting for the interaction kernel and applying external realistic wave functions , taken here from the bonn potential ) . to third order in the chiral expansion </S>",
    "<S> , we have worked out the s  wave multipoles as a function of the photon virtuality and discussed the sensitivity of these to the elementary @xmath1 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is free of undetermined parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the s  wave cross section and compared its behaviour to the case of the proton . to get a better handle on the single scattering amplitudes , </S>",
    "<S> we have scaled the elementary amplitudes so that they reproduce the fairly precise fourth order result ( at the photon point ) . </S>",
    "<S> the trends obtained in this short note should be substantiated by a full scale fourth order calculation , going also above threshold . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with the precise deuteron wave functions obtained in ref.@xcite , it will also be possible to perform the calculation entirely within the framework of effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> such an investigation is under way  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it would also be interesting to consider this process in the scheme of ref.@xcite , although that approach has so far not been tested in reactions involving on  shell pions on the external legs .    </S>",
