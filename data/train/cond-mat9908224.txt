    "among the properties of spin ladders , the best known is the reduction of order as we go from a single spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain to two coupled chains  : the single spin-@xmath0 chain is critical ( its correlation length is infinite ) whereas the spin-@xmath0 ladder has finite - range correlations and an excitation gap , growing linearly with interchain coupling @xmath1 , at least for small @xmath1 ( for a review and further references , see ref .  ) .",
    "this may seem paradoxical because one would naively expect that coupling two quasi - ordered chains would only increase the tendency to order , but a critical system like the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain is easily sent off - criticality by a perturbation such as ladder coupling @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we will study the corresponding spin-1 ladder ( two coupled spin-1 chains ) , which is already disordered and has a finite gap at @xmath2 . on the contrary",
    ", we will argue that the spin gap decreases as @xmath1 increases from zero , and does so for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interchain couplings , thus giving the gap @xmath3 a nonanalytic behavior ( a cusp ) at zero ( cf . fig .",
    "[ gapfig ] below ) .",
    "we will arrive at this conclusion after obtaining a field - theoretic description of the spin-1 ladder in terms of six quantum ising models , or alternately in terms of three boson fields .",
    "the motivation for using bosonization is that it offers a safer description of the system at weak @xmath1 , valid for both positive and negative @xmath1 , and allows at the same time for a description of the spin-1 zigzag chain , in which frustration plays a rle .",
    "thus , at small @xmath1 , this method is more general and reliable than a sigma model description . for a small antiferromagnetic interchain coupling ,",
    "the drop in the gap as a function of @xmath1 was already noticed in monte carlo simulations and accounted for with a nonlinear sigma model description of the spin-1 ladder.@xcite    we will consider the spin-1 ladder as a perturbed critical model , so that the low - energy description of the system will be a perturbed conformal field theory . the critical model used as a starting point is a pair of decoupled biquadratic spin chains , with hamiltonian [ critspin ] h_0=_,i\\ { _ , i_,i+1 - ( _ , i_,i+1)^2 } where @xmath4 is a spin-1 operator at site @xmath5 on chain @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . at this critical point",
    "the two chains are decoupled , each chain being described by an integrable model@xcite which is equivalent in the continuum limit to a level-2 su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model.@xcite we then need to consider the following perturbation : [ perturb ] h_i=(1+)_i , (_,i_,i+1)^2 + _ i _ 1,i[(1+)_2,i+(1-)_2,i+1 ] when @xmath8 , the first term brings us back to the heisenberg point ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the interchain interaction , of strength @xmath1 , is that of a ladder ( @xmath10 ) or of a zigzag chain ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we will proceed by ( i ) constructing a continuum description of the interaction in term of wzw models and ( ii ) finding out the behavior of this perturbed wzw model by field - theoretic methods , mainly through representations in terms of ising models ( fermionization ) and sine - gordon models ( bosonization ) .",

[ s-2chains ] , we write down a representation of two coupled spin-1 chains in terms of three bosons , using the bosonization formulas for pairs of ising models given in appendix  [ appising ] . in sect .",
    "[ s - gap ] , the behavior of the spin gap as a function of interchain coupling is inferred from this bosonized description . in sect .  [ s - zigzag ] , the spin-1 zigzag chain is considered instead , and a weak interchain coupling is argued to cause a short - distance incommensurability , i.e. , a displacement of the minimum of the one - magnon spectrum from @xmath12 .",

    "they are respectively @xmath36 and @xmath37 matrix fields .",
    "the link between the spin chain and the wzw model is given by the following representation of the spin operators in the continuum limit:@xcite [ spinwzw ] 1a_0s^a(x)=12 ( j^a(x)+^a(x ) ) + ( -1)^x / a_0g^a(x ) where @xmath38 is the lattice constant , @xmath39 a nonuniversal constant , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the right and left su(2 ) currents and @xmath42 is defined in terms of pauli matrices as g^a=12(^a g ) = 12_m , n^a_mn g_nm the currents ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and the field @xmath42 correspond to the soft modes of the spin chain near @xmath14 and @xmath43 , respectively .",

    "the first term ( @xmath49 ) is relevant , with scaling dimension 1 , and leads to a gap proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "there is an interesting equivalence between the @xmath29 su(2 ) wzw model and three quantum ising models,@xcite and so we will not have to deal with the wzw model directly .",

    "this ` gauge ' symmetry accounts for the expected degeneracy of the ground state near the critical point in open chains . specifically , recall that @xmath65 in the haldane phase . in our formulation",
    ", this corresponds to the disordered phase of the ising models ( see appendix  [ appising ] ) and the expectation value of the disordered operators is nonzero : @xmath66 . in this phase",
    "each ising model has a doubly - degenerate ground state , associated to different spin configurations at the ends of the open ising chain .",
    "the two ground states differ in the sign of @xmath67 . for the spin chain",
    ", this degeneracy implies an apparent eight - fold ( @xmath68 ) degeneracy , but the gauge invariance ( [ gaugesym ] ) reduces this to a physical four - fold degeneracy .",
    "these different ground states come from the breakdown of the hidden @xmath20 nonlocal symmetry alluded to above , and are physically equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . in this ising model description of the spin chain ,",
    "the elementary excitations are kinks switching from one value of @xmath67 at @xmath21 to its opposite at @xmath22 . on the other hand , fth and slyom@xcite",
    "have shown that the excitations of the heisenberg model are solitons connecting the ground states with different values of the string parameter ( [ string ] ) .",
    "we are thus led to identify these solitons with the kinks of the ising model .",
    "we can do the same exercise for @xmath69 ( or @xmath18 ) .",
    "we are now in the ordered phase of the ising models : @xmath70 .",
    "such an expectation value is already invariant under the gauge change ( [ gaugesym ] ) and therefore there are really 8 physically different ground states for the open chain .",
    "a hidden @xmath20 symmetry breaking is again expected and so these 8 different ground states will be locally equivalent to two distinct ground states in the thermodynamic limit , corresponding to the expected dimerized state .",
    "using the continuum description ( [ spinwzw ] ) of the spin operators , we obtain the following lagrangian density from the hamiltonian ( [ critspin],[perturb ] ) , in terms of wzw fields : [ lagcoupled ] & = & _ wzw[g]+_wzw[g ] + m+m -_1(j^a^a+j^a^a ) + & & + _",

    "the first three terms represent the intrachain interaction and the last four terms the interchain coupling .",
    "the interchain couplings @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are respectively proportional to @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 at high - energy , but they renormalize differently towards low - energy . the last term has been omitted in previous work on the zigzag spin chain,@xcite but since it respects the symmetry of the microscopic model , it is not forbidden and we expect @xmath74 to be nonzero",
    ". note that @xmath74 must be zero for the spin ladder , whereas @xmath73 vanishes for the pure zigzag chain . in the following",
    "we will consider the haldane phase only so that @xmath47 is negative .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagcoupled ] ) is difficult to study in terms of wzw fields .",
    "the simplest information we may extract from it is the scaling dimension of the various perturbations , from those of the various wzw fields .",
    "thus , the interchain couplings @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively have scaling dimension 2 , 2 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , the couplings @xmath71 and @xmath74 have conformal spin . by itself",
    ", a relevant coupling @xmath79 of scaling dimension @xmath80 and zero conformal spin is expected to produce a gap of order @xmath81 .",
    "thus , at the in - chain critical point ( @xmath13 ) , the interchain coupling @xmath73 would open a gap of order ( ) ~^4/5 in the spin-1 ladder .",
    "however , far from the critical point , the wzw model is of little help in predicting the behavior of the gap and the fermionic language seems more appropriate . using the representation ( [ wzwisingd][wzwisinge ] )",
    ", we can express the lagrangian density ( [ lagcoupled ] ) in terms of majorana fermions , order and disorder fields .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting expression is not easy to study since it contains a mixture of fields that are mutually nonlocal ( the order and disorder operators ) .",
    "an interesting way to deal with the lagrangian ( [ lagcoupled ] ) is bosonization .",
    "the 2d ising models may be bosonized by pairing them ( see appendix  [ appising ] ) .",
    "the natural way to bosonize the ladder is to pair an ising model describing one chain with its twin on the other chain . using the relations ( [ wzwisingd][wzwisinge ] ) , ( [ lagcoupled ] ) and ( [ bosonising ] ) , we obtain the following lagrangian density for two coupled spin-1 chains : [ lagboson ] & = & _ 0 + _ 1 + _ 2 + _ 3 + _ + _ + _ 0 & = & _ a=1,2,3 + _ 1 & = & 16_1_a=1,2,3(_a+1_a+2 + _",

    "we have adopted a periodic condition on the index @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "the twist term @xmath86 , the trickiest to bosonized , has been inferred from the representation ( [ emtens ] ) of the stress - energy tensor for each ising model , plus the usual operator product expansion ( ope ) between the energy - momentum tensor and a conformal field .",
    "thus , we have transformed the problem into a system of three perturbed sine - gordon models , although the simultaneous presence of the bosons @xmath83 and of their dual fields @xmath82 makes some perturbations nonlocal . however , as we will see , the most relevant perturbation is local and makes the problem tractable in this language .",
    "note that our normalization is such that @xmath87 is marginal for @xmath88 , and thus bound states appear in the sine - gordon model for @xmath89 .",
    "also , for @xmath90 , the @xmath91 symmetry is spontaneously broken and we have to consider fluctuations around one of the minima of the potential . however",
    ", it is important to keep in mind that our bosonization procedure is from the start invariant under the translation @xmath92 , and this @xmath93-periodicity property must be regarded as a constitutive constraint imposed on the sine - gordon models .",
    "thus , each sine - gordon model in @xmath94 has _ two _ inequivalent ground states , associated with the minima @xmath95 of the potential ( for @xmath65 ) .",
    "the spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry @xmath96 implies a nonzero expectation value for the operators @xmath97 ( the disorder operators @xmath54 ) and @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , this breakdown becomes explicit if the perturbation @xmath99 or @xmath86 is added .",
    "this symmetry breaking of the three sine - gordon models corresponds in fact to the hidden symmetry breaking in the spin-1 chain ( cf .",
    "[ phasediags ] ) .",
    "therefore the different choices of the ground state ( @xmath95 ) are equivalent , since the different ground states of the spin-1 chain are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . finally , let us recall that the elementary excitations of each sine - gordon model have finite mass and correspond to the kink and antikink connecting the two different ground states .",
    "the charge conjugation changing kink into antikink corresponds to the following transformation : [ cconjug ] ( x)2-(x )  mod  4    the presence of nonzero expectation values for the operators @xmath97 and @xmath98 implies that more relevant terms may be generated from the perturbations ( [ lagboson ] ) .",
    "if we call @xmath6 the expectation value of @xmath97 , say in the @xmath100 ground state , and @xmath101 that of @xmath98 , then [ meanfield ] = ^2+fluctuations the sign depend on the relative choice of the ground state for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the expectation values @xmath6 and @xmath101 have been obtained by lukyanov and zamolodchikov@xcite and are proportional to @xmath104 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "keeping only the most relevant terms and neglecting the fluctuations of @xmath105 and @xmath106 around these expectation values , we find the following effective lagrangian : [ lageff ] _",
    "eff=_a\\ { & & 18[(__a)^2+(_x_a)^2 ] -(2 m - 16_1_1)_a 42 ^ 2 + & & 42_a [ -- ] } at this level of approximation , we have three perturbed sine - gordon models  mutually coupled only if @xmath107  and the sign of the interchain coupling can be incorporated in the choice of ground state .",
    "thus , a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interchain coupling would have the same effect .",
    "note that the couplings @xmath73 and @xmath74 break the charge conjugation symmetry ( [ cconjug ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the spin-1 ladder , which corresponds to @xmath108 . the effective lagrangian ( [ lageff ] )",
    "then reduces to three decoupled , two - frequency sine - gordon models : _",
    "lad=_a\\{18[(__a)^2+(_x_a)^2 ] -m_a } [ laddereff ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this lagrangian has been studied by delfino and mussardo,@xcite who conclude that , as @xmath111 increases from zero , one of the kinks from each model becomes more massive , whereas the other one becomes less massive .",
    "this is easily understood by considering the evolution of the potential @xmath112 as a function of @xmath111 ( cf fig .",
    "[ potfig ] ) : the soliton having to bridge the potential barrier from @xmath113 to @xmath114 ( towards the right ) has a lower energy than the soliton going from @xmath113 to @xmath115 ( towards the left ) . which kink sees its mass decrease depends on the sign of the perturbation , but the net result is the same whatever this sign is . with the help of sine - gordon form factors,@xcite",
    "we can ascertain how the kink mass varies with @xmath111 . at first order ,",
    "the variation of the mass squared is:@xcite m_a^2f_a|a(i ) where the form factor @xmath116 is f_a|a ( )   where @xmath84 and @xmath117 represent the kink and antikink and @xmath118 are the associated rapidities ( @xmath119 ) . from ref .",
    ", we extract the following expression : f_a|a()&=-^i/2^/2 -^-i/2 ^ -/2&=-(m_a)^1/42 ^ 1/6a^3 ^ -1/42 where @xmath120 is the mass of the kink and @xmath121 is the glaisher constant . from this result",
    ", we see that @xmath122 vanishes at first order .",
    "we thus expect it to be proportional to @xmath123 , this is compatible with the semiclassical result that the variation of the mass of the kink is proportional to the variation of the height of the potential .",
    "we thus conclude that m_a    according to the analysis of ref .",
    ", a single two - frequency sine - gordon model has a @xmath124 ising fixed point , in addition to the gaussian fixed point at @xmath125 and @xmath126 . since the scaling dimensions of @xmath127 and @xmath111 at the gaussian fixed point are respectively @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the ratio @xmath130 is invariant under rg flow and is in fact a control parameter which tells us how far we are from the ising fixed point , characterized by a critical value @xmath131 . at this value ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath132 , the light kinks have exactly zero mass .",
    "if we return to an ising - model description of the system , we can understand intuitively how this flow happens : the effective lagrangian ( [ laddereff ] ) corresponds to six 2d ising models coupled pairwise by the following interaction : _",
    "ising= -2 thus , the excitation such that @xmath133 is parallel to @xmath134 will have a lower mass if @xmath135 ( a similar reasoning holds when @xmath136 , by changing the sign of @xmath137 ) .",
    "when @xmath111 is large enough , @xmath138 must be parallel to @xmath137 and this parallel configuration defines a new ising model , whose critical point occurs at some value of the ratio @xmath139 .",
    "whereas the mass gap vanishes at a finite value of @xmath111 in the effective lagrangian ( [ laddereff ] ) , this does not occur in the spin-1 ladder , because of the marginal terms @xmath140 and @xmath141 and of the ( neglected ) fluctuations of eq .",
    "( [ meanfield ] ) .",
    "we nevertheless expect that the spin-1 ladder should flow close to this fixed point and that the gap should decrease linearly with a weak interchain coupling , both on the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sides ( with the same slope ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the monte - carlo data of fig .  3 of ref .  , which illustrates this drop in the gap , for an antiferromagnetic interchain coupling only .",
    "that the gap drops on the ferromagnetic side is not surprising , considering that ( i ) the ladder becomes equivalent to a spin-2 chain at large ferromagnetic coupling and ( ii ) the gap of an antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with integer spin @xmath142 decreases with @xmath142 . on the antiferromagnetic side , the drop in the gap",
    "may be roughly understood as a greater tendency towards magnetic ordering , and should be maximum when @xmath143 . beyond @xmath143 , the gap must eventually turn around and increase linearly at large @xmath1 , since the lowest - lying excitations are then rung triplets , costing an energy @xmath1 .",

    "in this appendix , we review briefly the correspondence of the ising model with fermions , the conformal structure of the model and we indicate a set of careful bosonization formulas for a pair of ising models .      as is well known , the 2d statistical ising model is equivalent to a quantum ising chain in a transverse field , with hamiltonian [ isingtrans ] h=-_i^z_i-_i^x_i^x_i+1 where @xmath164 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ isingtrans ] ) can be diagonalized through a jordan - wigner transformation followed by a bogolubov - valatin transformation .",

    "thus @xmath168 is the critical point .",
    "a peculiarity of this model is the existence of a duality transformation mapping the ordered phase to the disordered phase and vice - versa . under this transformation the spin operators @xmath169",
    "are mapped to the so - called disorder operators , defined on links ( dual lattice ) by the following relations : [ disord ] _",
    "i+1/2^z & = & ^x_i^x_i+1 + _ i+1/2^x & = & _ ji_j^z let us apply the jordan - wigner transformation on the dual lattice .",

    "the fermions correspond to the kinks in the original formulation .",
    "indeed the fermion number on link @xmath171 is c_j+1/2^c_j+1/2 = 1-^x_j^x_j+12  , i.e. , there is no fermion on the link if the spins on @xmath172 and @xmath173 are parallel and one if they are antiparallel .",
    "note that the order parameter @xmath174 has a bosonic character , whereas the disorder parameter @xmath175 is fermionic .",
