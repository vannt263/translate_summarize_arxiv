    "it is well  known that the density of states in a pure one  dimensional interacting electron gas ( luttinger liquid ) vanishes as a power law in the vicinity of the fermi level @xcite : @xmath9 , where the exponent is determined by the interaction strength .",
    "such a behavior should reveal itself in the dependence of the differential tunnel conductance on the applied bias : @xmath10 .",
    "it is obvious that the presence of a disorder would perturb the local value of the density of states and , thus , cause some random correction , @xmath3 , to the conductance .",
    "then the relevant questions are :    \\i ) what is the typical magnitude of @xmath7 for a given realization of the disorder ?",
    "\\ii ) how the values of @xmath7 at different voltages are correlated ?",
    "\\iii ) how the correlation between the values of @xmath7 at the same voltage , but at different points of the liquid , falls off with increasing separation between the points ?",
    "these questions are addressed in the present paper .",
    "we will consider the case of a smooth disorder .",
    "namely , we will assume that the correlation radius is much larger than the fermi wavelength .",
    "this assumption simplifies the problem drastically , since it permits one to neglect the backward scattering of electrons and , hence , to view the disorder as a random variation of the electron concentration with coordinate .",
    "the key to understanding the role of the disorder is provided by the bosonization procedure @xcite , which allows to describe the low  energy excitations of the system in terms of bosonic excitations ( plasmons ) , propagating along the liquid .",
    "since the velocity of a plasmon depends on the concentration of electrons , the spatial variation of the concentration would give rise to the backscattering of plasmons .",
    "in other words , in the presense of a disorder , a plasmon with frequency @xmath1 acquires a finite mean free path @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to note that a smooth disorder , for which the backscattering of electrons at the fermi level is suppressed , might , ultimately , be quite efficient in backscattering of plasmons with wavelengths of the order of the correlation radius .",
    "for non  interacting electrons in one dimension it is established that even a weak disorder leads to the localization of all eigenstates @xcite . then the mean free path acquires the meaning of the localization radius .",
    "the same conclusion applies , certainly , to plasmons .",
    "the difference is , however , that an electron becomes more and more localized as its energy decreases , whereas for plasmons the situation is the opposite : the lower is the frequency , the weaker is the localization .",
    "since the dispersion law of a plasmon is linear : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the sound velocity , the density of the plasmon states is frequency  independent .",
    "the reason for suppression of the localization for the low ",
    "frequency plasmons is that the matrix element of the baskscattering vanishes in the limit of long wavelengths . in particular , we show that for small @xmath1 the frequency dependence of the mean free path is @xmath2 and , correspondingly , the product @xmath13 , which determines the localization strength , increases as @xmath14 when @xmath1 goes to zero .",
    "we also show that @xmath0 turns to infinity when the interactions are switched off , thus revealing that the backscattering of plasmons is possible only due to interactions .",
    "if the relative variation of the concentration is small , the disorder  induced correction to @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of the spectral characteristics of the localized plasmons ( such as local density of states ) . on the other hand ,",
    "these characteristics were the subject of detailed studies in application to the localized electrons @xcite . by utilizing the approach developed in refs .",
    ", we calculate the variance @xmath16 , and the two  point correlator @xmath17 .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath18 increases with voltage as @xmath19 and that the characteristic `` period '' of change of @xmath3 with voltage is of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "we also find that the two  point correlator falls off with @xmath20 as a power law and oscillates with the period @xmath21 , which is one half of the wavelength of a plasmon with frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the formula for the mean free path of a plasmon",
    "is derived . in section [ ctc ]",
    "we calculate the correlator of fluctuations of the tunnel conductance .",
    "section [ con ] concludes the paper .",

    "if the concentration is constant ( @xmath35 ) , the solutions of ( [ d ] ) are the plane waves @xmath36 with a linear spectrum @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the normalization length ) . substituting ( [ pw ] ) into ( [ d ] ) , we get the standard expression for the sound velocity @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fermi velocity .    assuming that the relative variation of the concentration is small , @xmath41 , the expression for the mean free time , @xmath42 , for a plasmon with frequency @xmath1 is given by the golden rule @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the plane wave with @xmath45 and @xmath46 stands for the averaging over the fluctuations of @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath14 in ( [ gr ] ) appears since we define the mean free time as @xmath47 . keeping only the first order terms in the difference @xmath48 , we get the following expression for the matrix element @xmath49 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy conservation , insured by the @xmath50-function in ( [ gr ] ) , requires that @xmath51 ( backscattering )",
    ". then we have @xmath52 and , as it can be easily seen , the second term in the matrix element vanishes identically . as a result",
    ", the matrix element takes the form @xmath53 we see that the matrix element for backscattering is proportional to the interaction strength , which reflects the fact that this process is possible only due to interactions .",
    "the mean free path , @xmath0 , defined as @xmath54 , can be found after substituting ( [ fme ] ) into ( [ gr ] ) @xmath55 where we have introduced the correlator of the fluctuations of @xmath22 @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the correlation radius and @xmath58 is the mean square fluctuation of @xmath22 , so that @xmath59 .",
    "it is instructive to rewrite ( [ mf ] ) for the product @xmath60 , which measures the effective scattering strength . assuming the gaussian form of the correlator , @xmath61",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 note that the last factor in ( [ mfg ] ) is a function of the argument @xmath63 and this function does not exceed unity .",
    "thus , the product @xmath13 is large for any @xmath1 . obviously , the backscattering is ineffective when @xmath64 , i.e. when the correlation radius @xmath57 exceeds the wave length of the plasmon . in the opposite limit , @xmath65 ,",
    "the mean free path behaves as @xmath66 . as it was mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the real meaning of @xmath0 is the localization length of a plasmon with frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that @xmath67 allows one to apply to localized plasmons , the description developed earlier for localized electrons @xcite just in this limit .",
    "this is done in the next section .",

    "the operator @xmath68 , creating an electron at point @xmath69 , can be presented in the form @xcite @xmath70 where the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 are defined as @xmath73 the calculation of the green function @xmath74 does not differ from that for a pure luttinger liquid and leads to the following expression for the density of states @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the sum over eigenmodes @xmath77 if @xmath22 is constant so that the eigenfunctions are given by ( [ pw ] ) , eq.([dos ] ) reproduces the known result @xcite for the density of states : @xmath78 , with @xmath79 indeed , for plane waves we have latexmath:[$|\\alpha_{\\mu}|^2=1/k_{\\mu}^2ln_0 ,     the function @xmath76 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the cutoff parameter . substituting this expression into ( [ dos ] ) leads to ( [ kappa ] ) .    to find the disorder - induced correction to @xmath83 , we treat the difference @xmath84 as a perturbation and expand the exponent in ( [ dos ] ) to the first order .",

    "concerning the correlator @xmath104 , we did not find the expression for this correlator in the literature .",

    "both correlators are proportional to @xmath122 and decay with increasing @xmath121 as @xmath123 .    to calculate the double integral in ( [ nucor ] ) , we make use of the fact that the correlators @xmath124 and @xmath104 are sharp functions of @xmath121 , i.e. the major contribution to the integral comes from the domain @xmath125 .",
    "this allows to put @xmath126 in all other factors and to extend the integration over @xmath127 to @xmath128 . noting that the integral of @xmath129 is equal to @xmath130",

    "however , this divergency is compensated by the frequency dependence of the mean free time , which at small @xmath137 behaves as @xmath136 .",

    "this function determines the coordinate dependence of the correlator ( [ nucor ] ) and , consequently , the coordinate dependence of the correlator of the fluctuations of the tunnel conductance @xmath148 the function @xmath141 is ploted in fig.1 . with increasing distance , it falls off and oscillates .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath149 at @xmath150 is as follows @xmath151 the spatial period of the oscillations of @xmath141 is @xmath152 and it decreases with increasing voltage .",
    "it is to be emphasized that such a behavior of the correlator of @xmath7 ( slow decay and oscillations ) is entirely due to interactions . in the absence of the interactions ,",
    "the correlator ( [ tcf ] ) would simply reproduce the correlator ( [ dc ] ) of the fluctuations of @xmath22 , i.e. it would decay monotonously at distance @xmath153 which is much smaller than @xmath154 .    at @xmath147 , the formula ( [ nucor ] ) defines the variance of @xmath97 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite it for the relative magnitude of the fluctuations of @xmath7 @xmath155 naturally , the variance @xmath156 is proportional to the magnitude of the fluctuations of the density .",
    "less trivial is that ( [ tcv ] ) contains two additional factors : @xmath157 which is proportional to @xmath133 at small @xmath27 , and a small factor @xmath158 ( note that ( [ tcv ] ) is written in the limit @xmath159 ) . this factor determines the voltage dependence : @xmath160 .",
    "qualitatively , this dependence can be interpreted as follows .",
    "formula ( [ fddos ] ) shows that all plasmon modes with frequencies smaller than @xmath1 contribute to @xmath161 .",
    "obviously , the major contribution comes from plasmons for which the center of localization lies within the localization radius from the point @xmath69 .",
    "let us consider some frequency strip @xmath162 centered at @xmath163 and with the width @xmath164 .",
    "then , the localization radius for all modes within this strip is approximately @xmath165 . for a spatial interval of length @xmath0 ,",
    "the typical frequency spacing between modes is @xmath166 .",
    "correspondingly , the average number of modes within the strip is @xmath167 and , hence , the relative fluctuation of this number is @xmath168 .",
    "the final estimate for the fluctuation of @xmath94 emergies if we set @xmath169",
    ". then , one gets @xmath170 . substituting ( [ mfg ] ) for @xmath171",
    ", we reproduce the voltage dependence in ( [ tcv ] ) .",
    "however , the estimate and the result of the calculation still differ by a factor @xmath172 .",
    "this factor originates from the specific details of the strucure of the eigenfunctions ( see the comment after eq .",
    "( [ int_e ] ) ) , and we can not interpret it qualitatively .",
    "note in conclusion of the section , that since all frequencies from @xmath173 to @xmath1 give , roughly , comparable contributions to @xmath161 , it will change significantly only when the frequency doubles .",
    "this means that at fixed @xmath69 the characteristic period of fluctuations in @xmath7 as a function of voltage is of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that the randomness in the concentration of electrons in the luttinger liquid causes a random component in the tunnel conductance which changes semiperiodically along the liquid , with the period depending on the applied bias .",
    "this behavior results from the fact that at a fixed bias , v , the frequencies of plasmons , responsible for the correction to the density of states , are strictly limited by @xmath174 .",
    "correspondingly , the oscillating behavior of the correlator of the fluctuations reflects the distribution of density in a plasmon with maximal frequency .",
    "if the conductance is studied as a function of bias , the disorder would cause fluctuations with characteristic period of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the fluctuations disappear as the wavelength of the plasmon with frequency @xmath174 becomes smaller than the spatial scale of the change of the concentration , @xmath57 .",
    "there is also a limitation from low voltages , imposed by the finite length of the liquid , @xmath38 .",
    "namely , our calculation applies when the mean free path of a plasmon , @xmath0 , is smaller than @xmath38 . at low enough frequencies",
    "@xmath0 exceeds @xmath38 and the disorder does not play any role . for such frequencies the oscillations of the tunnel conductance with voltage have their origin in the size quantization of plasmons , the period of oscillations being @xmath175 . these oscillations were studied in ref . .",
    "note finally , that the approach developed in the present paper can be extended to the case of the multichannel luttinger liquid @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the scattering of plasmons between the channels , caused by a disorder , should be taken into account .",
