    "the qcd - like theories with variable number of colors @xmath1 and ( light ) flavors @xmath2 have very rich phase structure , which only now starts emerging from theory and lattice simulations .",
    "it shows how naive are many textbook - style explanations , considering `` overlapping hadrons '' and `` percolating quarks '' .",
    "however , in all cases transitions happen at rather dilute stage of the hadronic phase the density of glueballs is negligible since even the lightest one has a mass of about 1.7 gev ! ] .",
    "naive geometric ideas can not explain why light fermions play such an important role .",
    "in particular , the critical temperature @xmath3 for pure gauge simulations ( @xmath4 ) and those with dynamical quarks ( @xmath5 ) differ by almost factor 2 , being @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . furthermore , at @xmath8 many physical quantities are very sensitive to such little details as the mass value of the strange quark .",
    "( that is why lattice results are still not quite definite about the @xmath9 of the transition in the real world . ) furthermore , on the phase diagram as a function of quark masses there are 2 distinct region of the 1-st order transitions : the one at large masses is referred to as `` deconfinement '' and the one at low masses `` chiral restoration '' .",
    "an important aspects of the chiral restoration is the role of the u(1 ) chiral symmetry , see @xcite .",
    "the standard arguments suggest that the @xmath10 meson ( the @xmath11 chiral partner of the pion ) becomes massless at @xmath12 .",
    "the question is what happens with their u(1 ) chiral partners , @xmath13 and isovector scalar ( with the old name @xmath14 and new one @xmath15 ) do .",
    "it remains unknown what happens with thir masses , and some lattice data suggest those become very light as well .",
    "apart of ( i ) increasing the temperature t , there are other things one can do to a qcd vacuum , and see when ( if at all ) the quark condensate disappear and chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "for example , one can ( ii ) increase the baryon density @xmath16 , ( iii ) increase the number of quarks @xmath2 in the theory , or ( iv ) apply the magnetic field .",
    "there are indications that the mechanism i am going to discuss work in all cases ( i - iii ) .",
    "however , in contrast to superconductivity , magnetic field does not destroy the quark condensate at all ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    by now",
    "there is large amount of evidence that in vacuum the chiral breaking and other phenomena related with hadrons made of light quarks are dominated by instantons , see recent review @xcite .",
    "the instanton - based models explain multiple correlation functions and hadronic spectroscopy , and are also directly supported by lattice studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the mechanism underlying chiral restoration .",
    "it is structural @xmath17 of ensemble of instantons , from relatively random liquid at low t to a gas of instanton anti - instanton `` molecules '' . in the case of high - t transition",
    "one can explain what happens at @xmath8 rather simply happen at about the same place .",
    "] recall that finite t field theory can be described in euclidean space - time by simply imposing finite periodic box in time , with the matsubara period @xmath18 .",
    "a rising t means shrinking box size , and it turns out the transition happens exactly when one @xmath19 molecule fits into the box . in a series of recent numerical simulations of the instanton ensembles ( see review @xcite ) this phenomenon is very clearly observed .",
    "not only we get chiral restoration at the right temperature , the order of the phase transition and its dependence on quark masses agrees with lattice data .",
    "transition looks like the @xmath20 order for @xmath21 massless flavors , but turns to a _ weak first order _ one for qcd with physical masses .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamic parameters , the spectra of the dirac operator , the t - dependence of the quark condensate and various susceptibilities , the screening masses and even the critical indices are consistent with available lattice data .",
    "phase diagram ( temperature - quark mass plane ) of the instanton liquid for different numbers of quark flavors , @xmath2=2,3 and 5 .",
    "the open squares indicate non - zero chiral condensate , while solid one indicate that it is zero .",
    "the dashed lines show the approximate location of the discontinuity line . ]",
    "few words about qcd with larger @xmath2 .",
    "fig.[myphases ] show that at @xmath22 instantons can no longer break the chiral symmetry case is missing , because the condensate is small and comparable to finite - size effects .",
    "amusingly , recent results from columbia group for @xmath23 have found exactly this : a dramatic drop in chiral symmetry breaking effects ( e.g. @xmath24 splittings . ]",
    "even at t=0 ( provided quarks are light enough ) . .",
    "on the other hand , if instantons can not break chiral symmetry , other effects like confinement or even one gluon exchange can do it , and according to @xcite this happens for @xmath25 .",
    "existing estimates @xcite show that the quark condensate in the domain @xmath26 is small , with a value from about 1/10 of the qcd value to the exponentially vanishing one a t the upper end .",
    "lattice measurements in this domain so far does not see it , and report chirally symmetric ground state at 8,12 and 16 flavors .",
    "the last topic is hadron modification near the phase transition line .",
    "their masses are expected to change as quark condensate decreases , and the most radical idea is the brown - rho scaling , suggesting that @xmath27 hadronic masses get their scale from the quark condensate , and therefore vanish at @xmath12 .",
    "however in a vacuum containing instanton molecules it is not so , because these objects generate new non - perturbative inter - quark interactions .",
    "the lagrangian describing those is discussed in @xcite : in some channels like @xmath28 it leads to attractive forces which ( if strong enough ) may creat bound states even @xmath29 the transition line .",
    "so far it is unclear whether it happens , but existence of these forces can be checked using the so called `` screening masses '' .",
    "their t - dependence for a number of hadronic channels was calculated in the interacting instanton model , and those show good agreement with lattice ones . especially important is strong attraction in scalar - pseudoscalar channels , shifting these masses down from their high - t asymptotic , @xmath30 .",
    "recent data obtained with heavy ion beams ( au at brookhaven and pb at cern ) have displayed very strong collective flow effects ( see other talks and my summary ) .",
    "these data can be used in order to obtain information about properties of the equation of state ( eos ) of hot / dense hadronic matter .    in order to do so",
    ", it is useful to return back from a ( very complicated ) cascade event generators to basic hydro description and can easily incorporate different scenarios ( e.g. , with or without the qcd phase transition ) .",
    "in contrast to longitudinal flow , for @xmath31 direction we know the initial conditions rather well , and therefore quantitative relation between the magnitude of the radial flow in central collisions and eos can be made .",
    "let me show some results from ( still unfinished ) work by m.hung and myself , which is aiming at developing a new model for ags / sps energy domain , called _ hydro - kinetic model _ ,",
    "the basic equation of state ( eos ) of hadronic matter used is that of a _ resonance gas _ , while for qgp one usually uses a simple bag - type eos , with a constant fitted to @xmath32 . in fig.[fig_eos](a ) we show that phase boundary and the paths on the phase diagram .",
    "as both baryon number and entropy is conserved , the lines are marked by their ratio .",
    "those for @xmath33 correspond approximately to sps ( 160 gev a ) and ags ( 11 gev a ) heavy ion collisions , respectively .",
    "note that the trajectory has a non - trivial zigzag shape , with re - heating in the mixed phase .",
    "the endpoint of the qgp branch is known as the `` softest point '' @xcite , while the beginning of the hadronic one we will call the `` hottest point '' .",
    "experimentally observable particle composition is related to the stage of the collision known as a @xmath34 freeze - out .",
    "multiple works ( e.g. @xcite ) have applied thermal description and determined where those points are on the @xmath35 phase diagram : for both ags and sps those ( inside error bars ) coincide with the  hottest points \" on our zigzag .",
    "the next step is to define the effective eos in the form @xmath36 ( needed for hydro ) _ on these lines _ : that is shown in fig.[fig_eos](b ) .",
    "note that the qcd resonance gas in fact has a very simple eos @xmath37 , while the  mixed phase \" is very soft indeed .",
    "the contrast between  softness \" of matter at dense stages and relative  stiffness \" at the dilute ones is strongly enhanced for the sps case .",
    "the final velocity of the observed collective `` flow '' is time integral of the acceleration , which is proportional to @xmath38 ratio plotted in fig.[fig_eos](b ) .",
    "although the observed velocity is not very different for both energies , this is kind of a coincidence since both the eos and the time development of the collisions are rather different . in short , it was found that this basic eos is too soft for ags data on flow , but describe well the sps case .",
    "most interesting , if one assume that there is @xmath39 phase transition at all , and @xmath40 like in the resonance gas , the flow obtained is way too strong .",
    "the most difficult puzzle related to radial flow is provided by experimental data showing that it has very strong a - dependence ( see e.g. talk by gaardhoje in this proceedings ) : the larger the nuclei , the stronger is the flow . to resolve this ( and other ) puzzle",
    "one should correctly include the kinetics of the freeze - out . in most hydro papers",
    ", expansion was cut off at fixed t , usually about 140 mev . in other words",
    ", it was assumed that the hadronic matter dries out very quickly , and its large pressure can not lead to any significant motion .",
    "the situation is different if one apply correct kinetic condition : the ( relevant ) collision rate approach the expansion rate .",
    "then one finds that with new high energy heavy ion beams ( pb at cern and au at bnl ) we now have access to @xmath41 hadronic gas , compared to medium ion collisions studied few years ago .",
    "the temperature of @xmath42 freeze - out i d only slightly smaller , 110 - 120 mev , but in terms of space - time evolution this difference imply a very significant change .",
    "for sufficiently heavy ion collisions the matter gets the  extra push \" from stiff pion gas at the end , which explains large flow velocity .    one interesting effect which follows from this observation : at the expansion stage without chemical but in thermal equilibrium the chemical potentials of all species change .",
    "the chemical potentials of the pions with the same sign . ] created in central pbpb it should reach @xmath43 .",
    "na44 data indeed support extra low-@xmath44 enhancement in pbpb relative to s - induced reaction .",
    "all phenomena discussed are predicted to be very much enhanced at rhic .",
    "larger multiplicity lead to ( paradoxically ) smaller final temperatures , and softness of the eos due to the qcd phase transition change the lifetime of matter by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
