    "since the work of benamou and brenier @xcite which showed that the squared @xmath0-wasserstein distance between two probability measures @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath3 can be expressed as the infimum of the kinetic energy @xmath4 among solutions of the continuity equation with prescribed endpoints @xmath5 it is natural to view optimal transport theory from a dynamical perspective and to look for geodesics rather than just for transport maps .",
    "similarly , probability measure valued curves governed by the continuity equation ( with specific dependence of the velocity field @xmath6 on the mass @xmath7 ) play a crucial role in the theory of gradient flows in the wassertsein space ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    in the recent paper @xcite ,",
    "dolbeault , nazaret and savar , introduced a new class of distances between probability measures through the introduction of some concave increasing nonnegative nonlinear mobility function @xmath8 . assuming that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the corresponding squared distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is ( formally ) given by the infimum of @xmath11 subject to @xmath12 from a riemannian - like metric viewpoint , the formal interpretation of this mobility function is a conformal deformation factor of the riemannian tensor on the tangent space of the space of probability measures at a given point @xmath7 . from a modelling viewpoint ,",
    "the concavity of @xmath8 is well suited to capture some congestion effects i.e. the fact that crowded zones of high densities result in higher values of the metric .",
    "since mccann s pioneering work on displacement convexity @xcite , it is well known that displacement convex functionals play a distinguished role in the theory of gradient flows on the space of probability measures equipped with the @xmath0-wasserstein distance . in @xcite , carrillo , lisini , slepcev and savar identified structural assumptions that guarantee the convexity of internal energy functionals along geodesics for the dolbeault , nazaret and savar distances with a general mobility function @xmath8 and this analysis will actually show useful for certain estimates in the present paper .",
    "let us mention that the monotonicity assumption on the mobility @xmath8 can be replaced by assuming that @xmath8 is compactly supported in an interval @xmath13 , corresponding to a hard congestion effect , since here the density can not assume values larger than @xmath14 .",
    "such a case has been treated in @xcite and also considered in @xcite .",
    "the main example that enters into this setting is @xmath15 , and a study of geodesics for the associated distance can be found in the article of brenier and puel @xcite , in the context of optimal multiphase transportation with a momentum constraint .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the case of a concave power mobility , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and to avoid both compactness and boundary conditions issues , instead of working on a domain or @xmath3 , we will consider the case of the flat torus @xmath18 . our goal is to characterize minimizing geodesics i.e. minimizers of @xmath19 subject to the constraint @xmath20 it is worth noting as in @xcite that @xmath21 naturally interpolates between the @xmath22 and the @xmath0-wasserstein distance when @xmath23 varies between @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "just as in @xcite taking @xmath26 as new variables , it is easy to see that this problem is a convex minimization problem , that is dual to some variational problem posed over some set of potentials @xmath27 ( which naturally play the role of lagrange multipliers associated to the constraint @xmath28 ) . formally , the optimality conditions for @xmath7 , @xmath27 obtained by convex duality read as the system @xmath29 let us remark that this system presents some similarities with the mean - field - games system of lasry and lions @xcite , @xcite . however , in the dual formulation the energy to be minimized is of the form @xmath30 for some positive constant @xmath31 .",
    "since this somehow nonstandard functional is not obviously coercive on some sobolev space , the existence of a potential by the direct method of the calculus of variations is not immediate at all . in order to obtain estimates on minimizing sequences ,",
    "a key ingredient is an estimate for some geodesic distances on @xmath32 given by lemma [ lem : estica ] . in particular",
    ", we have to assume here that @xmath33 , an assumption that recurrently appears in previous works on this distances .",
    "secondly , the potential we obtain is merely @xmath34 in time so some extra work has to be done to derive and justify rigorously the system of optimality conditions .",
    "this result and its proof suggest a different approach to the problem , by somehow lifting the geodesics problem to a variational problem at the level of measures on curves , which is reminiscent to the work of carlier - jimenez - santambrogio @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath35 a periodic measure supported by a suitable set @xmath36 of curves and which connects @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( in the sense that the image of @xmath35 by the evalution maps at initial and terminal time are respectively @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , define the measure @xmath37 on @xmath38\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d$ ] through @xmath39 for any continuous and periodic in space function @xmath40 .",
    "we will investigate the precise links between the geodesics problem above and the minimization of @xmath41    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ existadj ] ,",
    "when @xmath33 , we establish the existence and uniqueness of a potential function ( or adjoint state ) and give necessary and sufficient optimality conditions characterizing geodesics in section [ optimalcondi ] .",
    "section [ sec : pbdualcourbe ] is devoted to the equivalent reformulation as a variational problem posed on the set of probability measures over curves .",
    "in this section , we introduce ( a suitably relaxed version of ) the minimization problem , dual to the problem defining the distance between two probability densities .",
    "the existence of a solution strongly relies of the existence of a minimizing sequence satisfying some a priori estimates , the proof of which is postponed to subsection  [ aprioriest ] .",

    "we shall see that in some sense to be made more precise , the variational problem ( [ primal ] ) admits as dual the dolbeault - nazaret - savar problem in @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 stands for the absolutely continuous part of the measure @xmath7 with respect to the lebesgue measure and the supremum is performed among pairs of measures @xmath58\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d)\\times { { \\cal m}}([0,1]\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d)^d$ ] such that @xmath59 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure and @xmath60 is a weak solution of the continuity equation @xmath61 i.e. satisfies @xmath62 for every @xmath63\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d)$ ] .",
    "the fact that ( [ dns ] ) coincides with the problem studied in @xcite has to be a little bit further explained : first remark that if @xmath58\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d)\\times { { \\cal m}}([0,1]\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d)^d$ ] solves ( [ contweak ] ) then the time marginal of @xmath7 is the lebesgue measure . by disintegration",
    "we can thus write @xmath64 .",
    "note now that @xmath65 , which implies ( see for instance lemma 4.1 in @xcite ) that @xmath66 is continuous for the weak @xmath67 topology of @xmath68 .",
    "finally @xmath69 so that the functional in ( [ dns ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath70 which is exactly the functional to be minimized in @xcite .",

    "since elements of @xmath76 are bounded and monotone nonincreasing with respect to time , the second and third term in @xmath77 are well - defined by monotone convergence i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath79 are intended as @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . for further use ,",
