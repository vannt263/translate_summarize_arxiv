    "we have imaged the close environment of grs1915 + 105 with isocam at two epochs , on 1996 april 28 and on 1997 october 24 .",
    "the binary system appears in mid - infrared wavelengths as a faint point source , globally brighter in our 1997 observations than in the 1996 ones .",
    "no elongated structure was observed with 1.5@xmath1 pixel field of view , the best isocam resolution .",
    "we obtained the photometry with several large - band filters between 4 and 18@xmath0 m , and have compared it to simultaneous observations at near - infrared , radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "on 1996 april 28 grs1915 + 105 was in a high / soft state , with nearly constant rxte / asm flux ( @xmath2 90counts / s ) , no significant batse flux , and @xmath23mjy at 15ghz ( ryle telescope ) few days before and after .",
    "on 1997 october 24 , 5 days before a major radio and x - ray flare , the compact source was in a plateau state with @xmath2 50mjy at 2.25 & 8ghz ( gbi ) giving a radio spectral index @xmath3 , with low constant rxte / asm flux ( @xmath2 20counts / s ) and baste photon flux @xmath2 0.06 .",
    "the ir data have been de - reddened according to the law from lutz et al.(1996 ) .",
    "we used very simple models combining a hot black body emission or a hot synchrotron one to fit the near infrared data , with a cold black body emission ( for a dust envelope heated by the binary ) and a synchrotron emission extrapolated from radio wavelengths .",
    "we conclude that synchrotron emission alone is not sufficient to explain the mid - infrared flux of grs1915 + 105 , and that an additional contribution , which could be dust emission around the binary , is needed .",
    "ss433 is a high mass x - ray binary surrounded by the supernova remnant w50 , a bright radio nebula with a @xmath21@xmath4 unusual ellipsoidal morphology .",
    "ss433 produces relativistic jets at subarcsec scales and large scale lobes ( @xmath2 90pc at a distance of 5kpc ) .",
    "we have imaged the large scale west radio lobe with the isocam 14 - 16@xmath0 m filter and a @xmath5 pixel field of view resolution in september - october 1997 .",
