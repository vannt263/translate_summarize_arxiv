    "as is well known , the galactic halo chiefly consists of dark matter .",
    "a natural possibility - repeatedly considered in the past ( silk @xcite , carr @xcite ) - is that baryonic dark matter makes a substantial contribution .",
    "a few years ago , we recognized that the fall & rees theory for the formation of globular clusters ( fall & rees @xcite , kang et al .",
    "@xcite , vietri & pesce @xcite ) also leads to the existence of dark clusters - made of brown dwarfs and cold self - gravitating clouds - at galactocentric distances @xmath2 kpc ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the inner halo is populated by globular clusters whereas the outer halo is dominated by dark clusters .",
    "contrary to the case of globular clusters , a large amount of residual gas should remain clumped into the dark clusters , as brown dwarfs fail to generate the strong stellar winds which expel the leftover gas from globular clusters .",
    "moreover , although the clouds under consideration are mainly made of @xmath1 , we expect them to be surrounded by an atomic layer and a photo - ionized `` skin '' ( de paolis et al .",
    "we stress that the presence of cold self - gravitating clouds in the halo is a characteristic feature of the model in question . remarkably enough , quite recently it has been pointed out ( walker & wardle @xcite ) that cold self - gravitating clouds of the considered kind naturally explain the `` extreme scattering events '' associated with compact radio quasars ( fiedler et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our proposal was also motivated by the discovery of microlensing events towards the lmc ( alcock et al .",
    "@xcite , aubourg et al .",
    "the first - year data were manifestly consistent with the assumption that machos are brown dwarfs even within the standard ( isothermal ) galactic model .",
    "unfortunately , the present situation is much less clear .",
    "an option is that the halo resembles more closely a maximal disk rather than an isothermal sphere , in which case machos can still be brown dwarfs in mass ) can be binary systems , thereby counting as twice more massive objects ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "( see also binney @xcite ) . a more intriguing possibility has recently been suggested by kerins & evans ( @xcite ) and naturally fits within our model . as the initial mass function evidently changes with the galactic distance @xmath3",
    ", it can well happen that brown dwarfs dominate the halo mass density without however dominating the optical depth for microlensing .",
    "a few months ago , dixon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have re - analyzed the egret data concerning the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux with a wavelet - based technique .",
    "after subtraction of the isotropic extragalactic component and of the expected contribution from the milky way , they find a statistically significant diffuse emission from the galactic halo . at high - galactic latitude ,",
    "the integrated halo flux above 1 gev turns out to be @xmath4 @xmath0 @xmath5 s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 , which is slightly less than the diffuse extragalactic flux ( sreekumar et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    our aim is to show that the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic halo discovered by dixon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) can naturally be explained within the considered model .",
    "basically , the idea is that cosmic - ray ( cr ) protons in the galactic halo scatter on halo clouds , thereby producing the observed @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "unfortunately , neither theory nor observation allow nowadays to make sharp statements about the propagation of crs in the galactic halo .",
    "10 kpc . ] therefore , the only possibility to get some insight into this issue rests upon the extrapolation from the knowledge of cr propagation in the disk . actually , this strategy looks sensible , since the leading effect is cr scattering on inhomogeneities of the magnetic field over scales from @xmath7 pc down to less than @xmath8 pc ( berezinsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) and - according to our model - inhomogeneities of this kind are expected to be present in the halo , because of the existence of gas clouds - with a photo - ionized `` skin '' - clumped into dark clusters .",
    "pc , whereas typical values of the cloud radius are @xmath9 pc ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "as is well known , crs up to energies of @xmath10 gev are confined in the galactic disk for @xmath11 yr .",
    "crs escaping from the disk will further diffuse in the galactic halo , where they can be retained for a long time , owing to the scattering on the above - mentioned small inhomogeneities of the halo magnetic field .",
    "indirect evidence that crs are in fact trapped in a low - density halo has recently been reported .",
    "for example , simpson and connell ( @xcite ) argue that , based on measurements of isotopic abundances of the cosmic ratio @xmath12al/@xmath13al , the cr lifetimes are perhaps a factor of four larger than previously thought , thereby implying that crs traverse an average density smaller than that of the galactic disk .    a straightforward extension of the diffusion model ( berezinsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) implies that the cr escape time @xmath14 from the halo ( of size @xmath15 much larger than the disk half - thickness ) is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we recall that - for cr propagation in the disk - the diffusion coefficient is @xmath18 @xmath19 s@xmath6 in the ultra - relativistic regime , whereas it reads @xmath20 @xmath19 s@xmath6 in the non - relativistic regime ( see berezinsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "radio observations in clusters of galaxies yield for the corresponding diffusion constant @xmath21 a value similar to that found in the galactic disk ( schlickeiser , sievers & thiemann @xcite).g ( hillas @xcite ) .",
    "] so , it looks plausible that a similar value for @xmath21 also holds on intermediate scale lengths , namely within the galactic halo . in the lack of any further information on the energy - dependence of @xmath17",
    ", we assume the same dependence as that established for the disk .",
    "hence , from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) - with @xmath22 kpc - we find that for energies @xmath23 gev the escape time of crs from the halo is greater than the age of the galaxy @xmath24 yr ( notice that below the ultra - relativistic regime @xmath14 gets even longer ) . as a consequence - since the cr flux scales like @xmath25 ( see next section ) - protons with @xmath23 gev turn out to give the leading contribution to the cr flux .",
    "we are now in position to evaluate the cr energy density in the halo , getting @xmath26 where @xmath27 erg s@xmath6 is the galactic cr luminosity .",
    "notice , for comparison , that @xmath28 turns out to be about one tenth of the disk value ( gaisser @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that we have taken specific realistic values for the various parameters entering the above equations , in order to make a quantitative estimate .",
    "however , somewhat different values can be used .",
    "for instance , @xmath15 may range up to @xmath29 kpc ( bahcall , lubin & dorman @xcite ) , whereas @xmath21 might be as large as @xmath30 @xmath19 s@xmath6 consistently with our assumptions .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 can be as large as @xmath32 erg s@xmath6 ( vlk , aharonian & breitschwerdt @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see that these variations do not substantially affect our previous conclusions .",
    "we proceed to estimate the total @xmath0-ray flux produced by halo clouds clumped into the dark clusters through the interaction with high - energy cr protons . cr protons scatter on cloud protons giving rise ( in particular ) to pions , which subsequently decay into photons . we expect negligible high - energy ( @xmath33 100 mev ) @xmath0-ray photon absorption outside the clouds , since the mean free path is orders of magnitudes larger than the halo size .",
    "an essential ingredient is the knowledge of both @xmath34 and the cr spectrum @xmath35 in the galactic halo . according to the discussion in the previous section , we take @xmath36 ev @xmath37 .",
    "as far as @xmath35 is concerned , we adopt the following power - law @xmath38 where the constant @xmath39 is fixed by the requirement that the integrated energy flux ( in the range @xmath40 ) agrees with the above value of @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of @xmath41 is nontrivial . as an orientation",
    ", the observed spectrum of primary crs on earth entails @xmath42 .",
    "however , this conclusion can not be extrapolated to an arbitrary region in the halo ( and in the disk ) , since @xmath41 crucially depends on the diffusion processes undergone by crs .",
    "for instance , the best fit to egret data in the disk towards the galactic centre yields @xmath43 ( mori @xcite ) , thereby showing that @xmath41 increases as a consequence of diffusion . in the lack of any direct information , we conservatively take @xmath42 even in the halo , but in the table we report for comparison some results for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "as can be seen , the flux does not vary substantially .",
    "let us next turn our attention to the evaluation of the @xmath0-ray flux produced in halo clouds through the reactions @xmath44 .",
    "the source function @xmath45 - yielding the photon number density at distance @xmath46 from earth in the direction @xmath47 with energy @xmath48 - is @xmath49 where the lower integration limit @xmath50 is the minimal proton energy necessary to produce a photon with energy @xmath48 , @xmath51 is the inelastic pion production cross - section , @xmath52 is the photon multiplicity we employ the parameterization given by dermer ( @xcite ) . ] and @xmath53 is the halo gas density profile ,- ray detectors would not permit to distinguish between the two situations . ] which reads , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 kpc is our galactocentric distance . ]",
    "@xmath57 for @xmath58 , otherwise it vanishes . here",
    "@xmath59 kpc is the minimal galactocentric distance of the dark clusters in the galactic halo , @xmath60 denotes the fraction of halo dark matter in the form of gas , @xmath61 is the local dark matter density , @xmath62 kpc is the core radius and @xmath63 parametrizes the halo flattening . for the standard spherical halo model @xmath64 gev @xmath37 , whereas it turns out that e.g. @xmath65 gev @xmath37 .    because @xmath66 , it follows that the @xmath0-ray flux per unit solid angle produced in halo clouds and observed on earth from the direction @xmath47 is @xmath67 where typical values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are 10 kpc and 100 kpc , respectively .",
    "our main result - which follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ eqno:51 ] ) - are maps for the intensity distribution of the @xmath0-ray emission from baryonic dark matter in the halo . in order to make the discussion definite , we take @xmath70 .    in figure 1",
    "we show the contour plots in the first quadrant of the sky ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) for the @xmath0-ray flux at energy @xmath73 gev @xmath74 .",
    "corresponding contour plots for @xmath75 gev are identical , up to an overall constant factor equal to 8.74 ( again , this follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqno:51 ] ) ) .",
    "figure 1a refers to a spherical halo , whereas figure 1b pertains to a @xmath76 flattened halo .",
    "we see that - regardless of the adopted value for @xmath63 - at high - galactic latitude @xmath77 lies in the range @xmath78 @xmath0 @xmath5 s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 . however , the shape of the contour lines strongly depends on the flatness parameter .",
    "indeed , for @xmath79 there are two contour lines ( for each flux value ) approximately symmetric with respect to @xmath80 ( see figure 1a ) . on the other hand , for @xmath81",
    "there is a single contour line ( for each value of the flux ) which varies much less with the longitude ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "as we can see from the table and the figures , the predicted value for the @xmath0-ray flux at high - galactic latitude is very close to that found by dixon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion holds almost irrespectively of the flatness parameter .",
    "moreover , the comparison of the overall shape of the contour lines in our figures 1a and 1b with the corresponding ones in figure 3 of dixon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) entails that models with flatness parameter @xmath82 are in better agreement with data , thereby implying that most likely the halo dark matter is not spherically distributed .",
    "we remark that eq .",
    "( [ eqno:51 ] ) yields @xmath83 @xmath84 s@xmath6 @xmath5 sr@xmath6 at high - galactic latitude ( for a spherical halo ) .",
    "this value is roughly 40% of the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray emission of @xmath85 @xmath84 s@xmath6 @xmath5 sr@xmath6 found by the egret team ( sreekumar et al .",
    "so , our result supports the conclusion of dixon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that the halo @xmath0-ray emission is a relevant fraction of the isotropic diffuse flux also for @xmath86    before closing this letter , we would like to briefly address the crucial question whether the newly discovered @xmath0-ray halo emission really calls for a dark matter source .",
    "for , one might suspect that a nonstandard inverse - compton @xmath0-ray production mechanism could explain the data ( owing to the large uncertainties both in the electron hight scale and in the electron injection spectral index ) .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case .",
    "basically , the inverse - compton contour lines decrease much more rapidly than the observed ones .",
    "hence , it would be impossible to explain in this manner the @xmath0-ray flux found by dixon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) while still correctly accounting for the observed disk emission ( sreekumar et al .",
    "@xcite ) . a more detailed account of this topic will be presented elsewhere .    in conclusion",
    ", we feel that - in spite of the various uncertainties - the remarkably good agreement between theory and experiment makes our model for halo dark matter worth further consideration .",
    "in particular , the next generation of @xmath0-ray satellites like agile and glast can test our prediction , thanks to the higher sensitivity and the better angular resolution . in this respect",
    ", it might be interesting to measure whether there is an enhancement in the @xmath0-ray flux towards the nearby m31 galaxy , since we expect a similar mechanism for the @xmath0-ray production to hold in its halo as well .",
