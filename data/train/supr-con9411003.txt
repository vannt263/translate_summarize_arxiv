    "one of the most interesting developments in the study of high  temperature ( h@xmath0 ) superconductors has been the idea that the gap is not isotropic within the copper  oxide planes .",
    "there is considerable experimental evidence that this is the case ; angle resolved photoemission experiments @xcite , for example , have directly observed an anisotropic gap in the _ ab_plane spectrum of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , there have been a number of recent experiments @xcite in which the behaviour of the system can be explained by gaps which have at least one node on the fermi surface .",
    "there have also been a number of controversial tunneling experiments ( for example wollman _ et al _ @xcite ) in which the sign of the gap has been shown to change across the nodes .",
    "these experimental results have been taken as strong support for a gap with d  wave symmetry within the copper  oxide planes .",
    "the d  wave symmetry of the gap is an integral part of a number of theories of superconductivity , such as rvb @xcite and spin ",
    "fluctuation @xcite models .",
    "there are also a large number of bcs  like calculations @xcite ( of which we have only mentioned a few ) in which the ansatz is made that the gap has a d  wave structure .",
    "the one feature which is common to all of these calculations is that they are 2dimensional , and it is assumed that the effects of the third dimension will be weakly perturbative .",
    "this assumption reflects the belief that the superconductivity of the h@xmath0 materials occurs within the copper  oxide planes .",
    "the goal of this work is to consider the effect that the third dimension will have on the properties of an otherwise d  wave system . in particular",
    ", we will calculate the superconducting density of states ( dos ) of a layered s / n system . in this model , there are two layers in the unit cell .",
    "one of the layers ( s ) contains a d  wave pairing interaction which drives the superconducting transition . the second layer ( n )",
    "is intrinsically normal in the sense that it contains no pairing interaction , although it still becomes superconducting because of its proximity to the s layer . of the h@xmath0 materials , this model has the most in common with yba@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , where it is considered that the copper  oxygen planes contain a superconducting pairing mechanism and the copper  oxygen chains are intrinsically normal .",
    "our particular version of the layered s / n model is based on one studied previously @xcite , although the focus of these authors was somewhat different than here . in all cases ,",
    "the authors considered the gap of the isolated superconducting plane to be isotropic , and the discussion focussed on the anisotropy introduced by the interplane coupling .",
    "abrikosov and klemm @xcite were interested in how the interplane coupling affects the density of states , the isotropy of the raman spectrum and the behaviour of @xmath0 and the gap .",
    "et al _ @xcite calculated the density of states , while bulaevskii @xcite considered various properties of a layered s / n model in the limits of very weak and very strong interlayer coupling .",
    "et al . _ have calculated a number of observable quantities ( tunneling conductance , optical conductivity , knight shift and nuclear magnetic relaxation rate ) for a more complicated model in which there are five layers per unit cell . in this paper , the pairing in the s layer is chosen to have a d@xmath5 symmetry and we are interested in how the interplane coupling will change the density of states from the 2dimensional case @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec - dosi ] we introduce a model for a layered s / n superconductor and derive a formula for the density of states . in section [ sec - dosii ]",
    "we calculate the dos for different choices of model parameters .",
    "the discussion is broken up into two physically different limits . in one case ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of the two bands ( which result from the two layer types ) are far apart in the brillouin zone , while in the second case they coincide .",
    "the difference between these two limits is that , in the second case , there are important ( non  perturbative ) interference effects between the mean field and the interplane coupling . in section [ sec - conc ]",
    "we present a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section we introduce a model for a layered superconductor , which is based on one proposed by abrikosov @xcite . in this model we consider two types of metallic layers , stacked alternately one above the other in the z direction .",
    "these layers form two sublattices which we will assume are weakly coupled to each other .",
    "there is a bcs  like pairing potential localized about the layers of the first sublattice which is responsible for the superconductivity of the sample .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system can be written @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field operator of spin @xmath8 .",
    "the operator @xmath9 is the free particle hamiltonian , @xmath10 , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the potentials associated with each of the sublattices .",
    "the bcs  like pairing potential is @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the @xmath15values of the planes in the first sublattice .",
    "if the electrons are tightly bound to their planes , then the eigenstates of @xmath16 are well approximated by eigenstates of the sublattice hamiltonians @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( which are assumed known ) .",
    "eigenstates of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not orthogonal to each other , but may be orthogonalised to form a new set of states , @xmath19 , which are no longer eigenstates of the sublattice hamiltonians but which satisfy @xmath20",

    "the hamiltonian now becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the quasiparticle annihilation operator associated with the @xmath53 energy band .",

    "equation ( [ 10 ] ) is a self  consistent equation which can be solved numerically for the gap as a function of temperature .",

    "it is therefore possible to write the dos as the sum of the two sublattice densities of states @xmath78 we will evaluate both the dos and the gap equation , ( [ 10 ] ) , in the following section .",
    "the goal of this section is to discuss the density of states of our model .",
    "we will do this by examining the features of our quasiparticle energy dispersions . to begin with however",

    "the brillouin zone is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the lattice constant in the @xmath15direction .",
    "since @xmath82 describes the energy of an electron in a bloch state of one of the sublattices , it will have a weak @xmath31 dependence .",
    "however , a much larger @xmath31 dependence will come from @xmath83 , which describes the nearest neighbour hopping of electrons between layers of different types .",
    "the two chemical potentials in ( [ 4 ] ) allow the two bands to be offset from each other .",
    "the most significant feature of this choice of @xmath82 is that there are saddle points at @xmath84 ( at which @xmath85 ) and other symmetry related points .",
    "a great deal has been written about model systems in which the saddle points lie at the fermi surface where they play an important role in the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "we wish to avoid this case since the aim of this paper is to understand the role of the interlayer coupling . for all of the results presented in this paper , then",
    ", we have taken @xmath86 .",
    "the form of the interlattice coupling follows from the assumption that that the electrons are tightly bound to the planes : @xmath87 here @xmath88 and @xmath89 are complex constants , and the planes are alternately a distance @xmath90 and @xmath91 apart so that @xmath92 . the condition @xmath38 will be satisfied if @xmath88 and @xmath89 have the same phase . for our numerical calculations",
    "we reduce the number of free parameters by setting @xmath93 , @xmath94 so that @xmath95 one of the things which will become apparent is that , although the fine structure of certain features of the dos depend on the specific form we choose for @xmath83 , the existence and important properties of these features are independent of this choice .",
    "the pairing potential is taken to be separable so that @xmath96 , with @xmath97 for s  wave superconductors and @xmath98 for d  wave superconductors . in this case",
    "we can define @xmath99 by @xmath100 and equation ( [ 10 ] ) will simplify to @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "we solve equation ( [ 10a ] ) for @xmath0 and graph the results in fig .",
    "we can see that the critical temperature decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath103 which suggests that a weak coupling of the planes is necessary for any reasonable description of a h@xmath0 superconductor .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite , however , that the inclusion of phonon mediated interlayer coupling may actually lead to an increase in @xmath0 with coupling strength .",
    "we also calculate @xmath104 from equation ( [ 10a ] ) and plot @xmath105 in fig .",
    "we can see that @xmath105 increases rapidly for @xmath103 larger than @xmath106 . for ybco",
    "the value of @xmath107 depends on the experiment from which it is determined , but it is generally @xcite found to be less than 8 .",
    "it is important to remember that the experimentally measured value of the gap is typically the lowest energy peak in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum , which is not necessarily related in any simple fashion to the order parameter .",
    "however , as a rough estimate , we can limit @xmath108 so that , from fig .  [ tc ] , @xmath109 .    once @xmath104 is determined , we can proceed to calculate the dos for our hamiltonian .",
    "our discussion of the dos will be aided by two observations .",
    "the first is that equation ( [ 4 ] ) implies that @xmath110 and the second is that the brillouin zone boundary , @xmath111 maps into the diamond shaped boundary @xmath112\\ ] ] with @xmath113 and @xmath114 or @xmath69 .",
    "equations ( [ 10bb ] ) and ( [ 10cc ] ) allow us to discuss the system using @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 for that matter ) and @xmath63 , rather than @xmath117 and @xmath118 , as independent variables .    we will consider two limiting cases of eqn .",
    "( [ 10bb ] ) . in the first case",
    "@xmath119 so that @xmath120 everywhere in the brillouin zone . in the second case ,",
    "we take the fermi surfaces of the sublattices to coincide , so that @xmath121 .",
    "the fundamental difference between the two cases is that it is possible to distinguish band structure effects from superconductivity effects in the first case , while in the second case the interplane coupling plays an important role at the fermi surface .",
    "we begin by discussing the quasiparticle energy dispersions .",
    "first of all , for most regions of the brillouin zone @xmath122 and we see from eqn.([7 ] ) that @xmath123 approaches the limiting form @xmath124 in fig .",
    "[ energy ] we plot @xmath123 along the line @xmath125 , @xmath126 and compare it with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we have chosen an s  wave gap for illustrative purposes in the figure , since a d  wave gap would vanishe along this line . in regions of the brillouin zone where ( [ 10b ] ) is approximately true , the effect of the matrix elements @xmath129 will be to associate @xmath130 with the first sublattice and @xmath127 with the second sublattice , so that the integrands in equation ( [ 11 ] ) will become @xmath131 \\delta(\\omega - \\sqrt{\\xi_1 ^ 2 + \\delta_{\\bf k}^2 } ) &    \\nonumber \\\\    & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\xi_1}{\\sqrt{\\xi_1 ^ 2 + \\delta_{\\bf k}^2 } }    \\right ] \\delta(\\omega + \\sqrt{\\xi_1 ^ 2 + \\delta_{\\bf k}^2})&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 . for most energies ,",
    "then , the dos will simply look like the dos of the decoupled @xcite ( small @xmath33 ) limit , which we show in fig .",
    "[ d1 ]    it is the regions where the interlayer coupling has an important effect which we will discuss in the most detail . in figs .",
    "[ d3a ] , [ d3 ] and [ d2 ] we show the densities of states for nonzero interlayer coupling .",
    "these have a number of features that are absent in the uncoupled case , and we will discuss these features in turn .",
    "the first thing which is clear is that , as @xmath103 is increased and the system goes from being 2dimensional to 3dimensional , the logarithmic divergences associated with the van hove singularities ( both the superconducting one and those intrinsic to @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) become broadened peaks @xcite .",
    "this process is particularly clear in figs .",
    "[ d3a ] and [ d3 ] where the intrinsic singularities at @xmath135 in @xmath132 and @xmath136 in @xmath134 are broadened considerably by @xmath103 .",
    "the interlayer coupling is also important in regions of the brillouin zone where @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath137 .",
    "the effect of the coupling is to create avoided band crossings wherever @xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ energy ] , for example , we can see that there are two avoided crossings , one at @xmath139 , and one at @xmath140 .    at one of the avoided crossings ( @xmath139 in fig .",
    "[ energy ] ) , @xmath115 and @xmath116 have the same sign and ( expanding @xmath123 in powers of @xmath99 ) @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the solution to eqns .",
    "( [ 10c ] ) and ( [ 10bb ] ) for which @xmath115 and @xmath116 have the same sign .",
    "the energy difference of the bands at the avoided crossing is @xmath143 .",
    "we can see from fig .  [",
    "energy ] that this avoided crossing does not introduce a van hove singularity and , as a result , we do not find any feature in the dos of figs .",
    "[ d3a ] and [ d3 ] at this energy . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ d2 ] , we find that , because we have let @xmath144 , the avoided crossing occurs at the intrinsic van hove singularities of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the result of this is that the logarithmic peaks evident in fig .",
    "[ d1 ] at @xmath145 are reduced far more than in fig .",
    "[ d3 ] , where the avoided crossing is far from the singularities .",
    "this is an important result because it shows that models in which the van hove singularity plays an important role ( ie .",
    "it is near the fermi surface ) can not also have a band crossing near the fermi surface .",
    "for the second avoided band crossing ( at @xmath140 in fig.([energy ] ) ) , @xmath115 and @xmath116 have opposite sign .",
    "again we can expand @xmath123 in powers of @xmath99 , and we find that the avoided crossing occurs at @xmath146 ( @xmath147 is the solution to ( [ 10c ] ) and ( [ 10bb ] ) for which @xmath115 and @xmath116 have opposite sign ) .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ energy ] that there is actually a band gap of width @xmath148 at this point .",
    "what is interesting about this gap is that it only exists in the superconducting state ( since it is proportional to @xmath63 ) and that it forms _ away _ from the fermi surface .",
    "this is unusual since the effects of superconductivity normally manifest themselves near the fermi surface . in fig .",
    "[ d3a ] , these structures are clearly visible at @xmath149 in the first sublattice and @xmath150 in the second sublattice . in fig .",
    "[ d3 ] , the larger value of @xmath103 shifts the location of the minima slightly to @xmath151 . in fig .",
    "[ d2 ] , the structures are clearly visible at @xmath152 .",
    "the widths of the gap  like structures are given approximately by @xmath153\\ ] ] since the maximum value of @xmath63 allowed for @xmath147 is given by eqn .",
    "( [ 10cc ] ) .",
    "the source of this gap is not immediately obvious , but the proportionality of eqn .",
    "( [ 11b ] ) to @xmath154 suggests that it results from an interference of interlayer coupling and the mean field . in section [ sec - gap ] we will show that this is in fact the case , and we will discuss why these gaps appear on opposite sides of the fermi surface in each of the sublattices .    the final place where the interlayer coupling is important is near the fermi surface , where it influences the superconducting properties of the system . in fig .",
    "[ energy ] we see that @xmath50 has two local minima which are related to the superconducting gaps of the two sublattices .",
    "we expand @xmath50 ( eqn .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) ) in @xmath155 and @xmath47 to get @xmath156 equation ( [ 12 ] ) will vanish whenever @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this happens for two values of @xmath82 , which we denote by @xmath159 with @xmath160 . from eqn .",
    "( [ 10bb ] ) it is straightforward to show that    [ 12aa ] @xmath161    we then estimate the sizes of the superconducting gaps by substituting the equations ( [ 10cc ] ) , @xmath162 and @xmath163 into eqn.([12 ] ) : @xmath164\\ ] ] in the limit that @xmath103 becomes small , the gap sizes become @xmath165 \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\frac{\\delta_0 t({\\bf k})^2}{2(\\mu_2\\sigma_1-\\mu_1\\sigma_2 ) } \\left [    \\mbox{sgn}(\\mu_1 ) - \\frac{\\sigma_1(4\\sigma_1-|\\mu_1|)}{\\mu_2\\sigma_1 -    \\mu_1\\sigma_2 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath166 ^ 2 \\left[1-\\frac{|\\mu_2|}{4\\sigma_2}\\right].\\ ] ] equation ( [ 12cc ] ) shows how a weak interlattice coupling affects the gap in the intrinsically superconducting sublattice .",
    "one interesting point is that whether @xmath103 increases or decreases the gap size depends on the details of the band structure .",
    "when @xmath167 we have an approximate expression for the location of a logarithmic singularity in a two  dimensional d  wave superconductor .",
    "the exact expression @xcite is @xmath168 .",
    "equation ( [ 12dd ] ) shows the size of the induced gap in the intrinsically normal sublattice .",

    "in other words , features associated with one sublattice are reflected in the other sublattice with a strength proportional to @xmath176 .",
    "we can see quite clearly in fig .",

    "the important features of these expressions can be summarised simply .",

    "similarly , eqns .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 27aa ] ) give @xmath134 inside and outside the induced gap respectively .",
    "one of the most important features of the induced gap is that , since both @xmath180 and @xmath63 have nodes , there are a large number of low energy excitations .",
    "the density of states still vanishes inside the induced gap but instead of vanishing linearly , it vanishes with a divergent slope .",
    "we can see this in fig .",
    "[ d5 ] where we compare the low @xmath181 dos , calculated numerically from eqn .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , with the approximate expressions derived in the appendix",
    ".      we will now consider the case where the fermi surfaces of the two sublattices coincide , which requires that @xmath182 so that eqn .",
    "( [ 10bb ] ) becomes @xmath183 away from the fermi surface , the structure of the dos is that of the uncoupled ( @xmath167 ) limit for exactly the same reasons as in the previous case .",
    "near the fermi surface , however , the dos behaves quite differently and is somewhat more complicated to describe , though a partially quantitative understanding is still possible . in fig .",
    "[ energy2 ] we can see that @xmath50 still has a double minimum structure throughout much of the brillouin zone but that it is no longer possible to associate either of the minima with a particular sublattice . in figs .",
    "[ d4 ] and [ d4a ] , we show the dos for two different strengths of interlayer coupling . in fig .",
    "[ d4 ] , the density of states exhibits a nested gap structure at the fermi surface . for larger values of @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ d4a ] ) , the outer structure is no longer identifiable as a gap and the dos is similar in appearance to that of a 2dimensional d  wave material .",
    "however , as we shall see , the dependence of the gap width on the order parameter , @xmath99 , is vastly different than in the 2dimensional case .",
    "the complicated structure of figs.[d4 ] and [ d4a ] is due to the mixing of band structure and superconductivity effects at the fermi surface .",
    "because of this , it is not possible to replicate the analysis of the last section where we were able to identify gap  like structures in the dos with features of the energy spectrum .",
    "instead , it is necessary to resort to the brute  force method of identifying saddle point singularities in @xmath123 , and determining which features in the figures they are responsible for .",

    "the fermi surfaces of the s and n sublattices were far enough apart in the brillouin zone that the interlayer coupling did not cause them to interfere with each other . in this limit",

    "since the mean field can be viewed as an interaction between holes and electrons within the superconducting sublattice , and the interplane coupling is an interaction between electrons in the two sublattices , the interference of the terms results in an interaction of holes and electrons in different sublattices .",

    "as the coupling was increased , however ( fig.[d4a ] ) , the outer gap became unrecognizable and the total dos became very similar to that for a single layer system in which there is only one gap .",
    "perhaps the most important generalization which follows from this paper , then , is that the interference of the interlayer coupling and the superconducting mean field can produce surprising behaviour .",
    "one implication of this is that for a system like yba@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , where gap  like features have been observed in tunneling and raman scattering experiments , it could be very wrong to simply associate these features directly with the order parameter .",
