    "the extension of the theory of persistent homology to the case of persistent homology groups with torsion is an important open problem .",
    "indeed , the lack of a complete representation similar to the one given by persistent diagrams is a relevant obstacle to this development .",
    "however , this fact does not prevent us from using persistent homology groups with torsion for shape comparison . in order to show this ,",
    "we introduce here a new pseudo - distance @xmath0 between persistent homology groups with coefficients in an abelian group ( hence possibly having torsion ) , proving that @xmath0 is stable with respect to changes of the filtering functions , measured by the max - norm .",
    "we also express this stability as a lower bound for the natural pseudo - distance between topological spaces endowed with @xmath1-valued filtering functions .",
    "this approach opens the way to the use of persistent homology groups in concrete applications , extending some ideas developed in @xcite for size homotopy groups to persistent homology .",
    "now , let us illustrate how persistent homology groups with torsion can appear in applications .",
    "as an example , let us imagine to have to study all the possible ways of grasping an object by a robotic hand endowed with @xmath3 fingers .",
    "obviously , not all grasps can be considered equivalent .",
    "for example , some of them can be difficult to realize in practice , due to the position of the object and the technical capability of the hand .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to associate each grasp with a `` cost '' , represented by a real number . in one of the simplest cases , we can consider two fingers grasping an object whose surface @xmath4 is diffeomorphic to a spherical surface , in presence of friction . each grasp can be seen as an unordered pair @xmath5 of points on @xmath4 , and we can consider the set @xmath6 of all possible grasps ( endowed with the hausdorff distance between unordered pairs ) . if the cost of the grasp is given by a value @xmath7 , we are naturally led to the problem of comparing the similarity of the grasps possible for two different objects with surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath8 , with respect to the cost functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "this can be done by computing the ( singular ) persistent homology groups of each topological space @xmath6 with respect to the filtering function @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , we can consider the persistent homology groups @xmath12 given by the equivalence classes of cycles in @xmath13 that contain at least one cycle in @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents the set of points of @xmath6 at which @xmath16 takes a value not greater than @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in general , this procedure leads to groups with torsion , when the homology coefficients are the integer numbers .    to understand this ,",
    "let us consider a particularly simple example .",
    "let us assume that the cost of the grasp is given by the value @xmath18 , so relating the cost of a grasp to the level of closure of the robotic hand .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us examine the case @xmath19 . in this case , the group @xmath20 has torsion , when @xmath21 and @xmath22 is close enough to zero .",
    "indeed , we can consider the continuous function @xmath23 taking each unordered pair @xmath24 to the direction of the line @xmath25 through @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( note that @xmath24 implies @xmath28 , so that @xmath25 is well - defined ) .",
    "this direction can be seen as a point in the real projective plane @xmath29 .",
    "let us observe that , for @xmath30 close enough to zero , the function @xmath31 is a homotopy equivalence ( the homotopy inverse of @xmath23 is the function @xmath32 that takes each direction @xmath33 to the unordered pair @xmath5 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the points at which the line through @xmath34 , having direction @xmath33 , meets @xmath35 ) .",
    "hence @xmath23 induces an isomorphism between the singular homology groups of @xmath36 and @xmath29 . as a consequence ,",
    "since @xmath37 has torsion , the persistent homology group @xmath20 has torsion , too , when @xmath22 is close enough to zero . for an introduction to topological robotics",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "persistent homology has turned out to be a key mathematical method for studying the topology of data , with applications in an increasing number of fields , ranging from shape description ( e.g. , @xcite ) to data simplification @xcite and hole detection in sensor networks @xcite .",
    "recent surveys on the topic include @xcite .",
    "persistent homology describes topological events occurring through the filtration of a topological space @xmath38 ( e.g. , creation , merging , cancellation of connected components , tunnels , voids ) .",
    "filtrations are usually expressed by real functions @xmath39 called _ filtering functions_. the main idea underlying this approach is that the most important piece of information enclosed in geometrical data is usually the one that is `` _ _ persistent _ _ '' with respect to the defining parameters .",
    "until recently , research on persistence has mainly focused on the use of scalar functions for describing filtrations . the extent to which this theory can be generalized to a situation in which two or more functions characterize the data is currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "this generalization to vector - valued functions is usually known as the _ multidimensional persistence theory _",
    ", where the adjective multidimensional refers to the fact that filtering functions are vector - valued , and has no connections with the dimensionality of the space under study .",
    "the use of vector - valued filtering functions in this context enables the analysis of richer data structures .",
    "an important topic in current research about multidimensional persistent homology is the _ stability problem_. in plain words , we need to determine how the computation of invariants in this theory is affected by the unavoidable presence of noise and approximation errors . indeed",
    ", it is clear that any data acquisition is subject to perturbations and , if persistent homology were not stable , then distinct computational investigations of the same object could produce completely different results . obviously , this would make it impossible to use such a mathematical theory in real applications .",
    "up to our knowledge , no theoretical result is available for the metric comparison of persistent homology groups in presence of torsion , at the time we are writing .",
    "the problem of stability in persistent homology has been studied by cohen - steiner , edelsbrunner and harer in @xcite for scalar filtering functions . by using a descriptor called a _ persistence diagram _ , they prove that persistent betti numbers are stable under perturbations of filtering functions with respect to the max - norm , provided that the considered filtering functions are _ tame_. the same problem is studied in @xcite for tame lipschitz functions .",
    "in @xcite , chazal _ et al . _",
    "use the concept of _ persistence module _ and prove stability under the assumption that it is finite - dimensional .",
    "the problem of stability for scalar filtering functions is also approached in @xcite , where it is solved by assuming that the considered filtering functions are no more than continuous , but only for the 0th homology .",
    "multidimensional persistence was firstly investigated in @xcite as regards homotopy groups , and by carlsson and zomorodian in @xcite as regards homology modules . in this context , the first stability result has been obtained for the 0th homology in @xcite : a distance between the 0th persistent betti numbers , also called _ size functions _",
    ", has been introduced and proven to be stable under perturbations of continuous vector - valued filtering functions .",
    "such a result has been partially extended in @xcite for all homology degrees , under the restrictive assumption that the vector - valued filtering functions are _ max - tame_.      in this paper we introduce a new pseudo - distance @xmath0 between persistent homology groups , applicable also in the case that these groups have torsion ( theorem  [ isapseudodistance ] ) .",
    "moreover , we prove that @xmath0 is stable with respect to perturbation of the filtering function , measured by the max - norm ( corollary  [ cor2 ] ) .",
    "this result is a consequence of a new lower bound for the natural pseudo - distance @xmath40 ( theorem  [ bound ] ) , which also implies an easily computable lower bound for @xmath40 ( corollary  [ cor1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the link between @xmath0 and the matching distance @xmath41 between persistent diagrams , in the particular case that the filtering functions take values in @xmath42 and the coefficients are taken in a field , so that also @xmath41 can be applied ( theorem  [ dtlessthandelta ] ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ basics ]",
    "we recall the definition of persistent homology group and show some examples . in section  [ results ] the definition of @xmath0",
    "is given and our results are proven .",
