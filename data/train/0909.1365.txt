    "the nonlinear electrodynamics models have been proved to be excellent laboratories in order to circumvent some problems that occur in the standard maxwell theory .",
    "indeed , the interest for nonlinear electrodynamics has started with the precursor work of born and infeld , whose main motivation was to modify the standard maxwell theory in order to eliminate the problem of infinite energy of the electron @xcite . however , due to the fact that the born - infeld model did not fulfill all the hope , nonlinear electrodynamics theories become less popular .",
    "the recent renewal interest on the nonlinear electrodynamics theories is essentially due to their emergence in the context of low - energy limit of heterotic string theory , where a gauss - bonnet term coupled to quartic contractions of maxwell field strength appear , and black hole solutions can be obtained @xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention that nonlinear electrodynamics theories are a powerful tool for the construction of regular black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics properties of nonlinear electrodynamics theories is also an active research area in the current literature , see e.g. @xcite in the case of the born - infeld model .",
    "a very appealing property which is common to all the nonlinear electrodynamic models lie in the fact that these theories satisfy the zeroth and first law of black hole mechanics @xcite .",
    "this property renders more attractive the studies of nonlinear electrodynamics models .",
    "however , in contrast with the standard maxwell theory , the formula of the total mass , the so - called smarr formula @xcite , does not hold _ a priori _ for nonlinear electrodynamic theories @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of the einstein - maxwell system , the smarr formula and the first law of black holes mechanics are closely related and each of them can be derived from the other .",
    "this correspondence between both formulas is due to the homogeneity of the mass in terms of the area of the horizon and the electric charge @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of nonlinear electrodynamic theories , this homogeneity property is not longer present and there is _ a priori _ no good reason to obtain a smarr formula .",
    "some attempts to generalize the smarr formula in order to be in accordance with the variations expressed by the first law of black holes mechanics have shown to be possible for some particular magnetic solutions in four dimensions @xcite . for completeness , we stress that the derivation of the smarr formula as well as of the first law of thermodynamics are usually performed successfully for asymptotically flat spacetime through the komar integrals @xcite . however , their extension to rotating asymptotically anti - de sitter black hole solutions is not a simple task as it can be seen by reading the current literature on the topic @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider higher - dimensional gravity coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamic source given by a rational power @xmath0 of the maxwell invariant .",
    "this theory exhibits electrically charged black hole solutions as long as the exponent @xmath0 belongs to the set of rational number with odd denominator @xcite .",
    "similar considerations and motivations were previously analyzed in three dimensions in @xcite .",
    "recently , this nonlinear model has attracted attention , and it has been used for obtaining lovelock black holes @xcite , ricci flat rotating black branes @xcite , magnetic strings @xcite and topological black holes in gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this model for the non abelian case was considered in @xcite .",
    "the black hole solutions derived in @xcite are divided in four ranges for the exponent @xmath0 , and each of them correspond to a different spacelike asymptotic behavior of the metric . among these different classes , there exist black hole solutions with unusual asymptotic properties as those that go asymptotically to the minkowski spacetime slower than the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "there also exists a range for @xmath0 for which the solutions are not asymptotically flat and , their asymptotic behavior is shown to grow slower that the schwarzschild de sitter spacetime .",
    "extremal black hole solutions generalizing the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution are also known for this model @xcite .",
    "the main objective here is to provide a detailed analysis of the thermodynamical properties of these black hole solutions . in particular",
    ", we would like to explore the relation between the thermodynamical properties and the different asymptotic behaviors of the solutions .",
    "the thermodynamics of the electrically charged black hole solutions will be performed through the regge - teitelboim approach @xcite , in which an appropriate boundary term is added to the euclidean action such that the total action presents an extremum .",
    "on the other hand , owing to the fact that the euclidean action is related to the gibbs free energy , the identification of the mass and the charge , as well as the study of the global stability of the black holes will be considerably facilitated .",
    "we will derive a generalized smarr formula by using the explicit expressions of the temperature and the entropy .",
    "interesting enough , we will show that the different asymptotic behaviors of the black hole solutions are reflected through this smarr formula .",
    "in addition , we will present two other different ways of obtaining of the smarr formula . the first derivation is operated through the komar integrals for all the class of solutions even those that are not asymptotically flat .",
    "the same formula will also be obtained with the use of a noether conserved current which is associated to a scale symmetry of the reduced action .",
    "the local stability of the black holes are analyzed by computing the heat capacity and the electrical permittivity . for a certain range of the exponent @xmath0 , small black hole solutions with positive and negative mass",
    "will be shown to be locally stable .",
    "finally , the global stability is studied through the gibbs free energy in order to determine whether the electrically charged black hole solutions are most likely than the minkowski background . as a result",
    ", we will establish that there exists a phase transition for a certain range of the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the plan of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the nonlinear electrodynamics model and its general black hole solutions @xcite . in sec .",

    "the mass @xmath1 and the charge @xmath2 are explicitly identified and a generalized smarr formula is derived . in sec .",
    "iv the local and global stability of these black holes is analyzed , while the last section is devoted to the conclusions and further prospects .",
    "finally , two appendices are devoted to the different derivations of the smarr formula .",
    "in @xcite , a nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to gravity in @xmath3 spacetime dimensions . ] was considered .",
    "this model is described by the action @xmath4=\\int d^{d}x\\sqrt{-g}\\left ( \\frac{r}{2\\kappa } -\\alpha \\left ( f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu } \\right ) ^{p}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the gravitational constant , @xmath6 the coupling constant for the electrodynamical action , @xmath7 is the field strength and @xmath0 is a rational number whose range will be fixed later .",

    "the black hole solutions are not asymptotically flat , and their asymptotic behavior is shown to grow slower that the schwarzschild de sitter spacetime .",
    "finally , the critical value @xmath21 , which can only occur for odd dimensions @xmath22 , corresponds to the limit between the solutions which resemble to the standard reissner - nordstrm solution ( type i ) and those for which the asymptotic decaying to minkowski spacetime are slower than the schwarzschild spacetime ( type ii ) .",

    "interesting enough , we shall see that in both cases , the apparently divergent contributions at the infinity will cancel yielding to a finite and same expression in these two distinct cases .    for @xmath57 , the variations of the fields at infinity ( @xmath58 )",

    "indeed , the variations of the fields at infinity read @xmath65 and hence , @xmath66.\\label{l3}\\ ] ] as in the previous case , since the following equality @xmath67 holds for @xmath64 , the logarithmic dependance disappears yielding to the same variation ( [ kinfty ] ) .",
    "we conclude that in both cases , the integration of the variation ( [ kinfty ] ) leads to a finite expression given by @xmath68    in order to evaluate the variation of the metric function @xmath55 at the horizon @xmath69 , we use the fact that the solution satisfies @xmath70 together with the condition that ensure the absence of conical singularities at the horizon , that is @xmath71 .",
    "this condition fixes the temperature of the ensemble while the electric potential @xmath72 and the variation of @xmath40 are evaluated directly , @xmath73 the variation of the boundary term is easily integrated at the horizon yielding @xmath74 finally , the on - shell euclidean action , which reduces to the boundary term @xmath75 , reads in the case of flat spacetime . ] @xmath76 as it will be shown below , this expression is useful in order to identify the thermodynamical quantities and in the study of the global stability of the black hole solutions .",

    "we first observe that for @xmath84 , the relation ( [ smarrf ] ) reduces to the well - known smarr formula for the @xmath85dimensional einstein - maxwell black holes @xcite .",
    "another interesting value of the exponent is given by @xmath86 for which the contribution of the charge in the formula ( [ smarrf ] ) disappears and the formula is similar to the smarr formula for the schwarzschild solution .",
    "this is not surprising since in this case , the charge contribution in the metric ( see ( [ f ] ) and ( [ b ] ) ) becomes constant and hence , the solution resembles to the schwarzschild metric but with a deficit solid angle .",
    "in fact , this critical value of @xmath0 corresponds to the transition between the solutions which asymptote the minkowski spacetime ( type ii ) and those that go slowly than the schwarzschild de - sitter solutions , i. e. @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( type iii ) .",
    "this peculiar transition is also reflected in the total mass formula ( [ smarrf ] ) by the fact that the term proportional to the charge changes its sign .",
    "more precisely , the sign of the term proportional to the charge in the case of solutions of type ii is opposite to the sign relative of those of type iii , and the transition is precisely operated at the critical value @xmath86 .",
    "another value to consider is @xmath89 because of the apparent singularity of the formula ( [ smarrf ] ) .",
    "however , a detailed analysis shows that for @xmath89 the formula reduces to the standard smarr formula for the schwarzschild-(anti ) de sitter metric have been studied in @xcite . ] ( with a cosmological constant @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 where the expression of the horizon radius ( [ outerh ] ) is evaluated at @xmath89 .",
    "this is not surprising since at the level of the action , the value @xmath89 turns to be equivalent of having the einstein action with a cosmological constant . within this detailed study of the expression ( [ smarrf ] ) , we have pointed out that the smarr formula by its own reflects the different asymptotic behaviors of the black hole solutions .",
    "finally , we mention that the smarr law can also be derived in two different other manners : by using the komar integral even in the cases of the non asymptotic flat solutions , ( see appendix a1 ) or by constructing a noether conserved current which is associated to a scaling symmetry of the reduced action ( [ reducedaction ] ) , see appendix a2 .    for latter convenience ,",
    "we now express the mass and the temperature in terms of the horizon @xmath69 .",
    "since we are working in the grand canonical ensemble , these expressions must be written in terms of the fixed state variables , namely the potential @xmath92 and the temperature @xmath93 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that the mass @xmath1 expressed as a function of @xmath94 reads @xmath95.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation is useful to analyze the behavior of the mass with respect to the event horizon radius for the different classes of solutions , cf .",

    "the last graphs are respectively for @xmath110 and @xmath111 . for the exponent @xmath0 ranging over the set @xmath112 ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the solution is similar to the reissner - nordstrm black hole , and the analogy is also valid concerning the thermodynamics . in particular , for large value of the horizon , the temperature goes to zero while it reaches its maximum @xmath113 for a finite value of the horizon radius @xmath114 .",
    "in addition , there exists a value @xmath115 for which the temperature vanishes , which corresponds to an extremal black hole . for @xmath100 , the main difference with the previous case lies in the fact that there exist black holes with positive and negative mass , and the extremal solution",
    "is possible only for negative mass . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the temperature behavior is quite different since it is a decreasing function of the event horizon , and as before , the extremal solution is possible only with a negative mass .",
    "finally , for @xmath116 , the temperature is similar to the previous case , with the exceptions that the mass is always positive , and the value for which the temperature vanishes does not correspond to an extremal black hole . ]",
    "the thermodynamic stability of a system can be considered from many different point of views depending on which thermodynamical variables or state functions one is considering .",
    "usually , in order to study the stability of a system , it is common to consider small fluctuations of the state functions around the equilibrium , and since the first order terms vanish , the stability is only a statement about the second order variations",
    ". an equivalent manner of studying the local stability can be done by analyzing the sign of the heat capacity @xmath117 at constant potential @xmath118 as well as , the sign of the electrical permittivity @xmath119 at constant temperature @xmath120 from these definitions , it is clear that the heat capacity ( resp .",
    "the electrical permittivity ) gives information about the thermal stability with respect to the temperature fluctuations ( resp . to the electrical fluctuations ) .",
    "the positivity of the heat capacity , @xmath121 , is a necessary condition for the system to be locally stable and , this is a direct consequence of the definition ( [ cp ] ) and the fact that the entropy is proportional to the size of the black hole @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the black holes will be electrically unstable under electrical fluctuations if the electrical permittivity is negative .",
    "the physical interpretation of this instability is explained by the fact that in this case the potential decreases while the system acquires more charge , and hence the system may leave easily the equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "the local stability of a system will be ensured only if there exists a range of the horizon radius for which the quantities @xmath117 and @xmath119 are both positives .    in order to express the heat capacity ( [ cp ] ) as well as the electrical permittivity ( [ et ] ) in terms of the horizon radius ,",
    "we rewrite them as @xmath122 and @xmath123 however , since we have only the dependence of the charge @xmath2 in terms of the potential at constant horizon , we have to rewrite each factor of the above formula as @xmath124 combining these last expressions , the permittivity is found to be @xmath125 from the above formulas ( [ cphi ] ) and ( [ epsilont ] ) , it is clear that there is a strong influence of the exponent @xmath0 on the sign of these two expressions .",
    "moreover , for a positive exponent @xmath0 , both expressions will diverge at certain value of horizon radius @xmath114 , reflecting a radical change in the thermodynamical local stability of the system .",

    "i.e. @xmath84 , the singularity disappears and the heat capacity is always negative reflecting the instability of the solution . for the electrical permittivity ( cf .",
    "4 ) , the analysis is divided in two parts . for @xmath133 and for the region @xmath134 ,",
    "the permittivity is positive and hence we conclude that the system is locally stable . in contrast , for @xmath135 the system is unstable since there are no common regions where the heat capacity and the permittivity are both positive . for @xmath100 , only small black hole with @xmath136 and with negative mass are locally stable . finally for @xmath98 , independently of the sign of the mass , the solution is always unstable since the heat capacity is negative and hence the system is locally unstable .",

    "a first - order phase transition can be observed only in the first graph at the temperature @xmath138 . ]    in our case ( cf .",
    "fig 5 ) and for @xmath98 , since the temperature is a monotonous function of the event horizon radius , the free energy is a positive decreasing function and hence the minkowski background is more likely than the black hole configurations . for @xmath100 and for a fixed temperature two black hole configurations with",

    "we have studied the thermodynamical properties of black hole arising as solutions of higher - dimensional gravity coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics theory given as a power @xmath0 of the maxwell invariant .",
    "these solutions have the peculiarity of having different asymptotic behaviors depending mainly on the range of the exponent @xmath0 , including non asymptotically flat spacetimes .",

    "<S> we study the thermodynamical properties of electrically charged black hole solutions of a nonlinear electrodynamics theory defined by a power @xmath0 of the maxwell invariant , which is coupled to einstein gravity in four and higher spacetime dimensions . depending on the range of the parameter @xmath0 , these solutions present different asymptotic behaviors . </S>",

    "<S> the thermodynamical quantities are identified and in particular , the mass and the charge are shown to be finite for all classes of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a generalized smarr formula is derived and it is shown that this latter encodes perfectly the different asymptotic behaviors of the black hole solutions . </S>",
