    "light localization , one of the two central themes of this meeting , has its roots in electron localization .",
    "much of the theory was developed first for electrical conduction in metals at low temperatures , and then adapted to propagation of electromagnetic radiation through disordered dielectric media @xcite .",
    "low - temperature conduction translates into propagation that is monochromatic in the frequency domain , hence static in the time domain .",
    "this historical reason may explain in part why much of the literature on localization of light deals exclusively with static properties .",
    "of course one can think of other reasons , such as that a laser is a highly monochromatic light source .",
    "it is not accidental that one of the earliest papers on wave localization in the time domain @xcite appeared in the context of seismology , where the natural wave source ( an earthquake or explosion ) is more appropriately described by a delta function in time than a delta function in frequency .",
    "our own interest in the dynamics of localization came from its potential as a diagnostic tool .",
    "the signature of static localization , an exponential decay of the transmitted intensity with distance , is not unique , since absorption gives an exponential decay as well @xcite .",
    "this is at the origin of the difficulties surrounding an unambiguous demonstration of three - dimensional localization of light @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of localization and absorption are , however , entirely different .",
    "one such dynamical signature of localization @xcite is reviewed in this lecture .",
    "localization is a non - perturbative phenomenon and this severely complicates the theoretical problem . in two- and three - dimensional geometries ( thin films or bulk materials )",
    "not even the static case has been solved completely @xcite .",
    "the situation is more favorable in a one - dimensional waveguide geometry , where a complete solution of static localization exists @xcite .",
    "the introduction of dynamical aspects into the problem is a further complication , and we will therefore restrict ourselves to the waveguide geometry ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the number @xmath0 of propagating modes in the waveguide may be arbitrarily large , so that the geometry is more appropriately called _ quasi_-one - dimensional .",
    "( the strictly one - dimensional case @xmath3 is equivalent to a layered material . )",
    "the basic dynamical quantity that we will consider is the auto - correlator of the time - dependent wave amplitude @xmath4 , @xmath5 if the incident wave is a pulse in time , then the transmitted or reflected wave consists of rapid fluctuations with a slowly varying envelope ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the correlator @xmath6 selects the frequency component @xmath7 of the rapid fluctuations .",
    "the remaining @xmath8-dependence is governed by the propagation time through the waveguide .",
    "if the incident wave is not a pulse in time but a narrow band in frequency , then it is more convenient to study the frequency correlator @xmath9 the fourier transformed wave amplitude @xmath10 is complex , containing the real intensity @xmath11 and phase @xmath12 .",
    "most of the dynamical information is contained in the phase factor , which winds around the unit circle at a speed @xmath13 determined by the propagation time ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the correlator @xmath14 depends sensitively on the random locations of the scatterers in the waveguide , that give rise to the localization .",
    "this calls for a statistical treatment , in which we consider the probability distribution of @xmath14 in an ensemble of waveguides with different scatterer configurations .",
    "the method of random - matrix theory has proven to be very effective at obtaining statistical distributions for static scattering properties @xcite .",
    "the extension to dynamical properties reviewed here is equally effective for studies of the reflected wave .",
    "the time dependence of the transmitted wave is more problematic , for reasons that we will discuss .",
    "the low - frequency regime is most relevant for optical and microwave experiments @xcite , where one usually works with an incident beam that has a narrow frequency bandwidth relative to the inverse propagation time through the system .",
    "we assume that the length @xmath15 of the waveguide is long compared to the ( static ) localization length @xmath16 , which is equal to the product of the number of propagating modes @xmath0 and the mean free path @xmath17 .",
    "the reflected wave amplitudes @xmath18 in mode @xmath19 ( for unit incident wave amplitude in mode @xmath20 ) are contained in an @xmath21 reflection matrix @xmath22 .",
    "this matrix is unitary , provided we can disregard absorption in the waveguide .",
    "it is also symmetric , because of reciprocity .",
    "( we do not consider the case that time - reversal symmetry is broken by some magneto - optical effect . )    the correlator @xmath23 is the product of two unitary matrices , so it is also unitary .",
    "its eigenvalues @xmath24 , @xmath25 , contain the phase shifts @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath27 for all @xmath20 if @xmath28 , the relevant dynamical quantity at low frequencies is the limit @xmath29 which has the dimension of a time .",
    "it is known as the wigner - smith delay time , after the authors who first studied it in the context of nuclear scattering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 s may equivalently be defined as the eigenvalues of the hermitian time - delay matrix @xmath31 , @xmath32    experiments typically measure not the product of matrices , as in eq.([comegardef ] ) , but the product of amplitudes , as in eq.([comegadeltaomegadef ] ) .",
    "the amplitude measured within a single speckle ( or coherence area ) corresponds to a single matrix element .",
    "the typical observable is therefore not the wigner - smith delay time but a different dynamical quantity called the single - channel ( or single - mode ) delay time @xcite : @xmath33 if we decompose the complex reflection amplitude into intensity and phase , @xmath34 , then the single - channel delay time is the phase derivative , @xmath35 . since the reflection matrix @xmath36 has for small @xmath37 the expansion @xmath38",

    "mathematically , it is based on the analyticity of the scattering matrix in the upper half of the complex plane .",

    "an imaginary shift in frequency will lead to a spatially fluctuating absorption rate , but this is statistically equivalent to homogeneous absorption with an increased scattering rate . ]",

    "this relationship between reflection eigenvalues and wigner - smith delay times is useful because the effects of absorption have received more attention in the literature than dynamic effects .",
    "in particular , the case of a single - mode disordered waveguide with absorption was solved as early as 1959 , in the course of a radio - engineering problem @xcite .",

    "this is the high - frequency regime .",

    "the @xmath26 s are now distributed according to the laguerre ensemble ( [ pmuwire ] ) .",
    "* diffusive regime , @xmath218 .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath26 s does not belong to any of the known ensembles of random - matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the emphasis in this review has been on the localized regime .",
    "the dynamics is then dominated by resonances that allow the wave to penetrate deep into the waveguide .",
    "such resonances correspond to large delay times @xmath219 .",

    "a subtle and unexpected consequence of the resonances is the appearance of a dynamic coherent backscattering effect in the distribution of the single - mode delay times . unlike the conventional coherent backscattering effect in the static intensity",
    ", the dynamic effect requires localization for its existence .",
    "the recent progress in time - resolved measurements of light scattering from random media , reported at this meeting @xcite , should enable observation of this effect .",
    "extension of the theory to two- and three - dimensional localization remains a challenging problem for future research .",
    "we believe that the dynamic coherent backscattering effect will persist in higher dimensions , provided the localization length remains large compared to the mean free path .",
    "several methods have been proposed to distinguish absorption from localization in the static intensity @xcite .",
    "the effect reviewed here could provide this information from a different , dynamic , perspective .",
