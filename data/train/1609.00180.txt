    "charge transfer ( ct ) in biological molecules attracts recently considerable interest among the physical , chemical , biological and medical communities .",
    "it also attracts a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers .",
    "this is because ct constitutes the basis of many biological processes e.g. in various proteins  @xcite including metalloproteins  @xcite and enzymes  @xcite with medical and bioengineering applications @xcite .",
    "ct plays a central role in dna damage and repair @xcite and it , also , might be an indicator to discriminate between pathogenic and non - pathogenic mutations at an early stage @xcite . at least for twenty years",
    ", there have been many experimental attempts to recognize the electronic properties of dna cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite . today",
    "we know that many factors related to environment ( the aqueous solution , the concentration of counterions ) , extraction process , conducts , purity , base - pair sequence , geometry etc influence ct in dna .",
    "these factors can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic . in this work",
    "we focus on maybe the most important of the intrinsic factors , i.e. the effect of alternating the base ( or base - bair ) sequence , which affects the overlaps across the @xmath1-stack .",
    "additionally , we have to discriminate between the words transport ( usually implying the use of electrodes ) , transfer , migration ( a transfer over rather long distances ) .",
    "the carriers ( electrons or holes ) can be inserted via electrodes , generated by uv irradiation or by reduction and oxidation .",
    "the nature of charge transport , transfer , migration along the dna double helix is important for many scientific fields like physics , chemistry , biology , medicine and engineering .",
    "although unbiased charge transfer in dna nearly vanishes after 10 to 20 nm  @xcite , dna still remains a promising candidate as an electronic component in molecular electronics , e.g. as a short molecular wire  @xcite .",
    "favouring geometries and base sequences have still to be explored e.g. incorporation of sequences serving as molecular rectifiers , using non - natural bases or using the triplet acceptor anthraquinone for hole injection  @xcite .",
    "structural fluctuations could be another important factor which influences quantum transport through dna molecular wires  @xcite .",
    "the contact of dna segments with experimentally involved surfaces and interfaces is another research direction e.g. for bio - sensoric applications .",
    "for example , charge transfer on the contact of dna with gold nanoparticles  @xcite and polyelectrolyte multilayers @xcite has been recently investigated .    during the last decade ,",
    "the scientific literature has been enriched with works studying carrier oscillations within `` molecular '' systems .",
    "real - time time - dependent density functional theory ( rt - tddft )  @xcite simulations predicted oscillations ( @xmath2 0.1 - 10 phz ) within p - nitroaniline and ftc chromophore  @xcite , as well as within zinc porphyrin , green fluorescent protein chromophores and the adenine - thymine base pair  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in a simplified single - stranded helix of 101 bases , a collinear uniform electric field induces thz bloch oscillations  @xcite .",
    "single and multiple charge transfer within a typical dna dimer in connection to a bosonic bath has been studied , too  @xcite .",
    "each base pair was approximated by a single site , as in our tight binding ( tb ) approach at the base - pair level denoted in the present article as tb i [ cf . section  [ sec : general ] and appendix a ] . in the subspace of single charge transfer between base pairs , having initially placed the charge at the donor site and having used a `` typical hopping matrix element '' of 0.2 ev , the authors obtained a period slightly greater than 10 fs .",
    "let us call @xmath3 the period and @xmath4 the frequency . applying our equation  @xcite @xmath5 , with @xmath6 0.2 ev for the `` typical hopping matrix element '' and difference of the on - site energies @xmath7 for identical dimers i.e. as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath8 10.34 fs , which agrees splendidly with the dotted line in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , we studied b - dna dimers , trimers and polymers with tb i  @xcite .",
    "this approach allowed us to readily determine the spatiotemporal evolution of holes or electrons along a @xmath9 base - pair dna segment . with tb",
    "i , we have already shown  @xcite that for all dimers and for trimers made of identical monomers the carrier movement is periodic with frequencies in the mid- and far - infrared i.e. approximately in the thz domain  @xcite .",
    "this part of the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum is significant for biological sciences because it can be used to extract complementary to traditional spectroscopic measurements information e.g. on low - frequency bond vibrations , hydrogen bond stretching , bond torsions in liquids and gases etc and because it is relatively non - invasive compared to higher - frequency regions of the em spectrum  @xcite .",
    "within tb i , we also showed that , generally , increasing the number of monomers above three , periodicity is lost  @xcite .",
    "even for the simplest tetramer , the carrier movement is not periodic  @xcite . for periodic cases , we defined  @xcite the maximum transfer percentage @xmath10 , e.g. the maximum probability to find the carrier at the last monomer having placed it initially at the first monomer and the pure maximum transfer rate @xmath11 .",
    "for all cases , either periodic or not , the pure mean transfer rate @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ meantransferraten(i ) ] in appendix a ) and the speed @xmath13 , where @xmath14 3.4  is the charge transfer distance , can be used to characterize the system . within tb",
    "i , our analytical calculations and numerical results showed that for dimers @xmath15 and for trimers made of identical monomers @xmath16 . using @xmath12 to evaluate the easiness of charge transfer",
    ", we calculated the inverse decay length @xmath17 for exponential fits @xmath18 and the exponent @xmath19 for power law fits @xmath20 . studying b - dna polymers and segments taken from experiments  @xcite , we determined the ranges of values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "our tb i was used  @xcite to reproduce theoretical and experimental findings for various b - dna segments  @xcite . for monomer - polymers and dimer - polymers ,",
    "we studied homo and lumo eigenspectra , mean over time probabilities to find the carrier at a particular monomer and mean transfer rates , we illustrated how increasing the number of different parameters involved in tb i , the fall of @xmath18 or @xmath20 becomes steeper and we circumscribed the range covered by @xmath17 and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "finally , both for the time - independent and the time - dependent problem , we analyzed the _",
    "palindromicity _ and the _ degree of eigenspectrum dependence _ of the probabilities to find the carrier at a particular monomer  @xcite .    as in refs .",
    "@xcite , here we call _ monomer _ a b - dna base pair and study carrier oscillations in _ dimers _ and _ trimers_. moreover , for the first time we study _",
    "monomers_. however , here we employ two tight binding ( tb ) approaches : ( i ) at the base - pair level , using the on - site energies of the base pairs and the hopping parameters between successive base pairs which is _ a wire model _",
    "@xcite ( this was the approach employed in our previous works  @xcite ) and ( ii ) at the single - base level , using the on - site energies of the bases and the hopping parameters between neighbouring bases , specifically between ( a ) two successive bases in the same strand , ( b ) complementary bases that define a base pair , and ( c ) diagonally located bases of successive base pairs , which is _ an extended ladder model _ since it also includes the diagonal hoppings ( c ) .",
    "hence , it is more elaborate than the usual ladder model  @xcite .",
    "extrinsic effects , such as the aqueousness and the presence of counterions can also be taken into account in tb models which then can be renormalized via a decimation procedure to obtain either wire or ladder models , like the ones presented here @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the diagonal hoppings is essential e.g. for dimers made of identical monomers with crosswise purines cf .",
    "section 4 . additionally , tb ii allows us to study charge oscillations within monomers , which is not possible for tb i since there a site is a base pair .",
    "a few preliminary results with tb ii have been included in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "we assume that isolation of a few consecutive b - dna base pairs is possible , e.g. by connecting at the boundaries moieties with very small transfer integrals with the segment of interest .",
    "the tb parameters that we use can be found in refs .",
    "we solve analytically and numerically , with the eigenvalue method , a system of ( i ) @xmath9 or ( ii ) @xmath21 coupled differential equations to determine the spatiotemporal evolution of an extra carrier ( electron or hole ) along a @xmath9 base - pair dna segment .",
    "carriers move either between the homos or between the lumos of the relevant sites [ ( i ) base pairs , ( ii ) bases ]",
    ".    a legitimate critique to our theoretical predictions could be relative to a possible comparison with the experiment .",
    "as far as we know , such experiments in so short dna segments ( monomers , dimers , trimers ) do not exist . however , nowadays a variety of experimental techniques can be used to probe ct in biological molecules including optical , electrochemical and scanning probe techniques such as electrochemical stm and conductive afm @xcite . in our case",
    ", we can imagine the isolation of an oligomer by putting at its end moieties with very small hopping integral with the ends of the oligomer under investigation and subsequent use of one of these techniques .",
    "the techniques must be in the position to probe oscillations with frequency content in the 0.1 to 1000 thz regime i.e. time scales of 10 ps to 1 fs .",
    "additionally , our method tb i has already been used to successfully reproduce experimental results with longer dna segments relative to transfer rates and mean occupation probabilities  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that for monomers tb ii predicts periodic carrier oscillations with frequency @xmath0 50 - 550 thz ( but with very small transfer percentages ) , while tb i predicts periodic carrier oscillations with @xmath0 0.25 - 100 thz for dimers and with @xmath0 0.5 - 33 thz for trimers made of identical monomers .",
    "in other cases , either with tb i or tb ii , oscillations are not strictly periodic , but fourier analysis shows similar frequency content . for dimers and trimers",
    "tb i and tb ii give complementary aspects of the oscillations . for dimers made of identical monomers",
    "we have large carrier transfer and the occupation probability is equally shared between the two monomers which constitute the dimer . for dimers made of identical monomers , if purines are crosswise to purines , interstrand carrier transfer dominates , i.e. we have significant diagonal transfer uncovered by tb ii which includes _ diagonal hoppings _ ; if purines are on the same strand , intrastrand carrier transfer dominates . for dimers",
    "made of different monomers , tb ii basically shows intrastrand carrier transfer ( but in small percentage ) . in this work",
    "we show that thz oscillations in dna monomers , dimers and trimers exist and we study the frequency content , the maximum transfer percentages , the transfer rates between sites and the mean probabilities to find the carrier at a site .",
    "hence , one could imagine the future built of a source or receiver of em radiation in the range 0.1 thz to 1000 thz made of tiny dna segments .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we outline our tb i and tb ii approaches in general terms skipping technical details , which are presented in appendix a. our results for monomers , dimers and trimers are presented in sections  [ sec : resultsmonomers ] , [ sec : resultsdimers ] and [ sec : resultstrimers ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we state our conclusions .",
    "we begin with our notation . by yx we denote two successive base pairs , according to the convention @xmath22 for the dna strands orientation .",
    "we denote by x , x@xmath23 , y , y@xmath23 dna bases , where x@xmath23 ( y@xmath23 ) is the complementary base of x ( y ) . in other words",
    ", the notation yx means that the bases y and x of two successive base pairs are located at the same strand in the direction @xmath24 .",
    "x - x@xmath23 is the one base pair and y - y@xmath23 is the other base pair , separated and twisted by 3.4  and @xmath25 , respectively , relatively to the first base pair , along the growth axis of the nucleotide chain .",
    "for example , the notation gt denotes that one strand contains g and t in the direction @xmath24 and the complementary strand contains c and a in the direction @xmath26 . in the sense explained above , we can talk for equivalent dimers i.e. @xmath27 and expand the notion of equivalency to @xmath9-mers .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that an extra hole or electron inserted in a dna segment travels through homos or lumos , respectively . hence , for each base pair or _ monomer _ , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) play a key role .",
    "we utilize two tight - binding approximations , the main points of which are explained below .",
    "the mathematical details are given in appendix a. here we merely describe them in general terms to make the manuscript more accessible for readers from different areas of the rather wide dna science . in tb",
    "i the carrier is located at a base pair and it can move to the next or to the previous base pair . hence , this is a _ wire model _  @xcite . in tb",
    "ii the carrier is located at a base and it can move ( 1 ) to its complementary base of the same base pair or ( 2 ) to the next or the previous base of the same strand or ( 3 ) to the diagonally located base of the other strand of the next or the previous base pair in the @xmath28 or in the @xmath29 direction , respectively . if we ignore ( 3 ) , this would be a _ ladder model _",
    "@xcite . here , since we also include diagonal hoppings we call it an _ extended ladder model _",
    "it will become evident below that in some cases ( e.g. in dimers when purines are crosswise to purines ) interstrand carrier transfer dominates , in other words we have significant diagonal transfer , which justifies the inclusion of diagonal hoppings in our model tb ii .",

    "[ sec : resultsmonomers ] , [ sec : resultsdimers ] , and [ sec : resultstrimers ] we show that thz oscillations in dna monomers , dimers and trimers exist .",
    "we study the frequency content of these oscillations ; where necessary , we employ fourier analysis . for periodic cases ,",
    "we study the maximum carrier transfer percentage @xmath10 from an initial site to a final site , as well as the relevant maximum transfer rate @xmath30 showing not only how fast the transfer is , but also what the maximum carrier transfer percentage is . for all cases , either periodic or not",
    ", we use the mean transfer rate @xmath31 , which shows not only how fast the transfer from site @xmath32 to site @xmath33 is , but also what the mean carrier transfer percentage from site @xmath32 to site @xmath33 is ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ meantransferraten ] ) .",
    "tb i can not be used for charge transfer in monomers , since it considers a monomer as a single site .",
    "hence , we use tb ii , supposing that initially we place the carrier at one of the bases . we can prove that an extra hole or electron oscillates between the bases of the two possible monomers ( g - c and a - t ) with frequency ( or period ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hopping integral between the complementary bases and @xmath36 is the energy gap between the on - site energies of the complementary bases . our results for a - t and g - c , both for holes and electrons , are shown in fig .",

    "<S> we call _ monomer _ a b - dna base pair and study , analytically and numerically , electron or hole oscillations in _ monomers _ , _ dimers _ and _ trimers_. we employ two tight binding ( tb ) approaches : ( i ) at the base - pair level , using the on - site energies of the base pairs and the hopping parameters between successive base pairs i.e. _ a wire model _ , and ( ii ) at the single - base level , using the on - site energies of the bases and the hopping parameters between neighbouring bases , specifically between ( a ) two successive bases in the same strand , ( b ) complementary bases that define a base pair , and ( c ) diagonally located bases of successive base pairs , i.e. _ an extended ladder model _ since it also includes the diagonal hoppings ( c ) . for _ monomers _ , with tb ii , we predict periodic carrier oscillations with frequency @xmath0 50 - 550 thz . for _ dimers </S>",
    "<S> _ , with tb i , we predict periodic carrier oscillations with @xmath0 0.25 - 100 thz . for _ trimers made of identical monomers _ </S>",
    "<S> , with tb i , we predict periodic carrier oscillations with @xmath0 0.5 - 33 thz . </S>",
    "<S> in other cases , either with tb i or tb ii , the oscillations may be not strictly periodic , but fourier analysis shows similar frequency content . for dimers and trimers , tb </S>",
    "<S> i and tb ii are successfully compared giving complementary aspects of the oscillations .    _ keywords </S>",
