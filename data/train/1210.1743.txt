    "<S> we obtain electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath4 and superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 9.1 k in lao@xmath3f@xmath3bis@xmath0 , indicating that this compound can be explained as a conventional phonon - mediated superconductor , quite different from the fe - based materials  @xcite but somewhat similar to the ni - based compounds .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    we used the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method implemented in the wien2k package  @xcite for the lattice parameter optimization and electronic structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) presented by wu and cohen  @xcite was used for the exchange - correlation energy calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this gga is a nonempirical approximation that gives significant improvements of calculations for lattice constants and crystal structures . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon dispersion and the electron - phonon coupling are calculated using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon dispersions were obtained in linear response via the quantum - espresso program  @xcite and ultrasoft pseudopotentials . </S>",
    "<S> the gga of perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite was adopted for the exchange - correlation potentials with a cutoff of 60 ry for the wave functions and 600 ry for the charge density .    </S>",
    "<S> lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 with @xmath16=0 or 1 is crystallized in the zrcusias type tetragonal structure ( p4/nmm ) with la , bi , s1 in the bi planes , s2 in between bi - s1 and la - o(f ) planes , and o(f ) being at the positions @xmath17(0.5 , 0 , @xmath18 ) , @xmath17(0.5 , 0 , @xmath19 ) , @xmath17(0.5 , 0 , @xmath20 ) , @xmath17(0.5 , 0 , @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22(0 , 0 , 0 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the f substitution at the o sites in lao@xmath3f@xmath3bis@xmath0 reduces the symmetry to a space group of p-4m2 . starting from the lattice parameters ( @xmath23 4.0527 @xmath24 and @xmath25 13.3237 @xmath24 ) reported by mizuguchi @xmath26 @xmath27  @xcite , we have performed the full structural optimization including the lattice parameters and atomic positions , the obtained results being summarized in table [ tab.1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , with doping f from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , the @xmath30 value increases gradually but the @xmath31 value decreases , accompanied with a decrease of primitive cell volume @xmath32 . by making a comparison in the atomic bond length between lao@xmath3f@xmath3bis@xmath0 and laobis@xmath0 </S>",

    "<S> [ fig.2]a , in which there are 30 phonon bands extending up to @xmath14 450 @xmath34 and the point group at the @xmath35 and @xmath36 points is @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 and @xmath36-point modes can be decomposed as @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath40 mode is degenerate , and its frequencies are listed in table [ tab.2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the raman modes at the zone center can be measured directly by experiments in near future . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phonon density of states ( pdos ) , eliashberg spectral function @xmath41 , electron - phonon coupling @xmath42 and projected pdos are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are three distinct peaks centered at @xmath14 70 @xmath34 ( @xmath43 mode at @xmath35 point ) , @xmath14 190 @xmath34 ( @xmath40 mode at @xmath35 point ) , and @xmath14 250 @xmath34 ( @xmath44 mode at @xmath35 point ) , respectively , corresponding to three thick lines from lower to upper in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2]a . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2]b , the @xmath43 mode corresponds to the vertical vibrations with the upper and lower bis@xmath0-layers ( la - layers ) beating against each other . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath40 mode corresponds to the in - plane stretching vibrations with motion along the @xmath45 axis . in the @xmath44 mode , the la , bi , and s1 atoms </S>",
    "<S> vibrate along the same @xmath46 direction , opposite to the vibration direction of the s2 , o , and f atoms . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3 ] , one can see that the bands around 70 @xmath34 comes mainly from the pdos contributions of the bi and la motion , the peak at 190 @xmath34 mainly corresponds to the s character , and that at 250 @xmath34 corresponds to f , o and s character . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated eliashberg spectral function has peaks in consistent with the pdos at the low - frequency regime , and is evidently enhanced in the intermediate frequency regime . in the dfpt calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the eliashberg spectral function depends directly on the electron - phonon matrix element : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the number of k points used in the summation , @xmath49 is the density of states at the fermi level , and @xmath50 are the phonon frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - phonon matrix element @xmath51 is defined by the variation in the self - consistent crystal potential . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the electron - phonon interaction of bi - s1 bond plays an important role in the enhancement of @xmath52 . from the @xmath42 curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3]a , where @xmath53d\\omega$ ] , one finds that @xmath54 has been close to @xmath55 , indicating that the phonon modes in the low and intermediate frequency regimes have the main contribution to the electron - phonon coupling . from the @xmath41 spectra in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3 ] , we get the electron - phonon coupling @xmath56 = 0.8 and the logarithmically averaged frequency @xmath57 = 192 k. using further the allen - dynes formula with the coulomb parameter @xmath58= 0.1 , we finally obtain @xmath8 = 9.1 k , which is found very close to the experimental value @xmath8 = 10.6 k.  @xcite it then follows that the doped lao@xmath3f@xmath3bis@xmath0 is very likely a conventional electron - phonon superconductor .    in summary , the present first - principles calculations indicate that lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 changes from a band insulator at @xmath28 to a band metal upon doping . similar to lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 , electrons in lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> are doped from the lao(f ) redox layer to the superconducting bis@xmath0 layers . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59-orbital states of bi - s1 layers play an important role in the electron transformation due to their domination of the dos at the fermi level . from the phonon calculations for lao@xmath3f@xmath3bis@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a strong electron - phonon coupling of @xmath56 = 0.8 and a superconducting transition temperature of @xmath8 = 9.1 k , the latter being very close to its experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> it then follows that lao@xmath3f@xmath3bis@xmath0 is a conventional electron - phonon superconductor .    for lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the electronic states near the fermi level are dominantly from the hybridized @xmath59 orbital states of the bi and s1 atoms , and the electron - phonon coupling comes mainly from the contribution of the bi and s phonons . </S>",
    "<S> these facts indicate that the bis@xmath0 layers play an important role in the transport and superconducting properties , similar to the cuo@xmath0 layers of the cuprates or fe - as layers of the fe - based superconductors . </S>"
