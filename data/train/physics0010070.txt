    "the propagation of light in random or fluctuating media has long been used as a probe of their statistical properties @xcite .",
    "this holds true also for exotic media like the background of gravitational waves in the space between the earth and some faraway light source @xcite ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "recently several authors have proposed searches for quantum gravity effects in the propagation of light over cosmological distances or in earth - based interferometers ; for instance , according to ellis , mavromatos and nanopoulos @xcite , the vacuum of quantum gravity should be dispersive and this should show up as an energy - dependent spread in the arrival times of energetic photons from distant sources like gamma - ray bursters , active galactic nuclei , and gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "this opens up interesting observational opportunities for experimentalists ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but requires either a violation of lorentz invariance or of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the proposal @xcite is based on the latest developments of @xmath4-brane theory , and it is yet another picture of the `` space - time foam '' first proposed by wheeler in 1957 @xcite , and later considered by other authors such as hawking @xcite .",
    "here we propose a heuristic treatment of these background fluctuations , which is based on the direct use of the uncertainty principle for energy and time , with additional assumptions on the dynamic and statistical behaviour of the resulting quantum fluctuations .",
    "afterwards we use this model to evaluate the spectral properties of the fluctuations of the energy density and of the gravitational potential , and to derive the behaviour of light in a generic two - arm interferometer .        ' '' ''    p.",
    "bergmann @xcite originally suggested to search for low - frequency components of gravitational waves by attempting to detect fluctuations in the intensity of light , but actually most searches for this effect have been carried out looking for fluctuations in the arrival times of pulses from millisecond pulsars and other such sources .",
    "see @xcite for the details of how one such search is performed , and @xcite for a recent review .",
    "we consider now a single quantum fluctuation of the vacuum energy density and assume that it is uniformly spread over a spherical region , then the total energy associated with the fluctuation is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radius of the bubble .",
    "we assume that the bubble expands at the speed of light , so that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the time of creation of the bubble , and that it satisfies the time - energy uncertainty principle at all times , so that @xmath9 , and therefore we find @xmath10 it is also important to note that the expanding bubbles are just a representation of the light cones in @xmath11-space , therefore they are lorentz invariant , i.e. , they would look the same in any other lorentz - boosted reference frame .",
    "a rough form of lorentz invariance is thus present in our model , whose causal structure is compatible with a relativistic model of spacetime , and these fluctuations satisfy the requirement , first discussed by zeldovich @xcite , that the quantum vacuum must indeed be lorentz invariant .",
    "now let @xmath12 be the number density of the fluctuations that occur in spacetime , i.e. , @xmath13 fluctuations are created in a small space - time volume @xmath14 at position @xmath15 and time @xmath8 , and assume that @xmath13 is a poisson variate with average @xmath16 and variance @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) ; then the average density observed at @xmath17 and due to the fluctuations created at a distance _",
    "r _ and at an earlier time @xmath18 is @xmath19        ' '' ''",
    "then the total energy density observed at @xmath17 and due to all the prior fluctuations in the light - cone of the observer is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the age of the universe , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the minimum and the maximum distance from the observer .",
    "furthermore in ( [ eq4 ] ) we have dropped the @xmath15 dependence , because we assume translational invariance .",
    "the maximum distance can be taken to be the present radius of the universe @xmath24 , while the minimum radius corresponds to the smallest bubble that can possibly be observed , that is that bubble that emerges from a `` mini black hole '' stage and turns into a `` normal '' fluctuation , so that @xmath22 is just the schwartzschild radius of the fluctuation : @xmath25 we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and find @xmath26 which is just the planck length . thus eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) gives an average density @xmath27 it is worthwhile to notice that a minimum and a maximum scale show up naturally in the calculations , and that the total energy density ( [ eq7 ] ) is seamlessly related to both the micro and the macrostructure of the universe .",
    "the same formalism can be used to estimate the variance of the energy density fluctuations , and proceeding as before one finds @xmath28 it is also important to notice that the average energy density ( [ eq7 ] ) contributes to the effective cosmological constant @xcite : @xmath29 recent observations favour a nonzero and positive cosmological constant @xcite such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; this means that we can use ( [ eq9 ] ) to estimate the order of magnitude of the free parameter @xmath32 , if we assume that most of the effective cosmological constant is due to the fluctuations considered here : @xmath33",
    "since we assume that fluctuations spread with the speed of light , there can be no gravitational potential outside the bubble , because for an external observer there is no way to know that it exists , while inside the bubble we assume that the gravitational potential is just the ( newtonian ) potential of a sphere of uniform energy density @xmath34 : @xmath35 integrating as in the case of the energy density one finds : @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "a somewhat more complicated integration yields the correlation function of the gravitational potential : @xmath38 where the shorthand notation @xmath39 has been used , @xmath40 and _ s _ is the range of acceptable values of @xmath41  i.e. , values such that @xmath42 .    the expression ( [ eq14 ] ) can be calculated for different special cases , e.g. , the time correlation function at a given space point is @xmath43 and then , using the wiener - kintchine theorem , one finds @xmath44",
    "in the weak field approximation the frequency of light is linearly related to the gravitational potential @xmath45 therefore , using the correlation function ( [ eq14 ] ) , one finds that the time correlation function for the irradiance fluctuations in a two - arm interferometer is @xmath46\\phi \\left [ { \\vec{x}\\left ( { \\frac{{\\ell _ { 2 } } } { { c } } + \\tau }   \\right),\\frac{{\\ell _ { 2 } } } { { c } } + \\tau }   \\right ] } \\right\\rangle , \\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the position along the path @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the frequency of light in a zero - potential region , @xmath50 is the irradiance of light along each path , and @xmath51 is the average phase difference .      99 sheng p ( ed . ) _ scattering and localization of classical waves in random media _ , singapore , world scientific , 1990 bergmann p ( 1971 ) _ phys",
