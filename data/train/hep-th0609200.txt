    "the creation of an electron positron pair in an almost stationary very strong external electromagnetic field ( a potential well ) is often referred to as spontaneous pair creation ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "[ pair ]    this adiabatic phenomenon emerges straightforwardly from the dirac sea interpretation of negative energy states : an adiabatically increasing field ( a potential well of changing deepness ) lifts a particle from the sea to the positive energy subspace ( by the adiabatic theorem ) where it hopefully scatters and when the potential is switched off one has one free electron and one unoccupied state  a hole  in the sea @xcite-@xcite ( see figure [ pair ] )",
    ". a better terminology  and the one we shall use here  is thus adiabatic pair creation ( apc ) .    the figure shows the bound state energy curve of a bound state @xmath0 emerging from the dirac sea ( vacuum ) , changing with time @xmath1 due to the change of the potential well . if the potential reaches a high enough value ( critical value ) the bound state enters the upper continuum and scatters and if it has enough time to escape from the range of the potential , before the potential decreases under its critical value a pair will be created .",
    "the experimental realization of apc has been extensively debated for heavy ion collision .",
    "we note already here that the theoretical descriptions concerning rates and line shapes were false .",
    "the main reason is that no coherent theoretical approach had been found .",
    "we give more details later .",
    "pair creation is also hotly debated in classical laser field technology nowadays @xcite .",
    "but surprisingly the theoretical work on pair creation in classical laser fields which is universally referred to as spontaneous pair creation made no contact with adiabatic theory which in fact it is . indeed most of the theoretical work is questionable and with that the hope for experimental feasibility .",
    "we shall point out where present day arguments are dubious ( reviewing the relevant literature ) and we shall present an argument and a new , well founded experimental possibility for pair creation in a field which is a combination of an ion field and a classical laser field .",
    "we believe that this is in fact the only possible experimental realization feasible in the near future",
    ". we shall give the details after our theoretical treatment of apc which we do next .",
    "what we present here is the heuristic core of a mathematical proof of apc ( c.f .",
    "this proof while being mathematically and technically very involved is helpful to find confidence in the heuristic short argument we shall give .",
    "the mathematical proof changes the quantitative statements only slightly .",
    "consider the one particle dirac equation with external electromagnetic field . on microscopic time- and space - scales",
    "@xmath2 the equation reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the adiabatic parameter , representing the slow time variation of the external potential and @xmath5 gives the potential in the units @xmath6 ( we discuss later physical values for @xmath4 ) .",
    "we consider the dirac equation on the macroscopic time scale @xmath7 : @xmath8 the spectrum of the dirac operator without external field is @xmath9\\cap[1,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "the adiabatic theorem ensures@xcite ( for @xmath4 small ) that the gap can only be crossed by bound states @xmath10 of the dirac operator @xmath11 for which @xmath12 is a curve crossing the gap ( see figure ) .",
    "let us call the curve a gap - bridge .",
    "_ if there is no gap - bridge the probability of pair creation is exponentially small in @xmath13 _ .",
    "it is very important to take note of this : no matter how steep the potential well is , i.e. no matter how strong the `` force '' is , if there is no gap - bridge pairs will only be created with exponentially small rate .",
    "we assume now , that a gap - bridge exists and consider the bound state @xmath14 ( assumed to be non degenerate ) at the crossing .",
    "we expand it in generalized eigenfunctions which of course depend also on the `` parameter '' @xmath1 .",
    "we shall need the eigenfunctions for times @xmath15 close to the critical time @xmath16 .",
    "consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath17 for fixed @xmath18 .",
    "the continuous subspace is spanned by generalized eigenfunctions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with energy @xmath21 .",
    "for ease of notation we will drop the spin index @xmath22 in what follows .",
    "the generalized eigenfunctions also solve the lippmann schwinger equation @xmath23 with @xmath24 , the generalized eigenfunctions of the free dirac operator @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 is the kernel of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "introducing the operator @xmath28 @xmath29 ( [ ls ] ) becomes @xmath30 note that @xmath31    we estimate the propagation of a wave function generated by the _",
    "static _ dirac operator @xmath32 , where @xmath33 should be thought of as near the critical value ( the relevant regime turns out to be of order @xmath34 ) .",
    "since the generalized eigenfunctions for @xmath35 are close to the bound state @xmath14 it is reasonable to write in leading order : @xmath36 since they solve ( [ ls ] ) , the first summand of ( [ ls ] ) must become negligible with respect to @xmath37 , which is part of the second summand . hence @xmath38 must diverge for @xmath39 . for",
    "the outgoing asymptote of the state @xmath14 ( generalized fourier transform ) evolved with @xmath40 near criticality we have with ( [ dieistrichtig ] ) that @xmath41 now , for @xmath42 close to but different from @xmath43 , @xmath44 will be peaked around a value @xmath45 with width @xmath46 ( determined below ) defined by @xmath47 we may use the width for the rough estimate @xmath48 where the right hand side should be multiplied by some appropriate constant which we  since it is not substantial  take to be one . using ( [ dieistrichtig ] ) ,",
    "( [ her ] ) , @xmath49 and partial integration ( observing @xmath50 ) we get    @xmath51    by ( [ ableitung ] ) , ( [ her ] ) and ( [ defdelta ] ) , assuming that @xmath52 @xmath53 hence @xmath54 since @xmath14 is normalized we get for the decay time @xmath55 , defined by @xmath56 @xmath57    the important information we must provide is thus @xmath38 for @xmath58 . in view of ( [ lse ] ) and ( [ dieistrichtig ] ) we have that @xmath59 we can estimate @xmath38 by considering the scalar product of ( [ lse2 ] ) with @xmath60 :",
    "@xmath61 one finds that @xmath62 with an appropriate @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath64 expanding @xmath28 in orders of @xmath65 around @xmath66 until fourth order yields ( the first order term turns out to be zero on general grounds ( @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath67 for @xmath68 the denominator behaves like @xmath69 , otherwise it behaves like @xmath70 .",
    "hence by ( [ her ] ) @xmath71 this result @xcite differs from the results given in the literature ( see e.g. formula ( 7 ) in @xcite ) , we shall discuss more details below .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ lemgeprobe ] ) obviously diverges for @xmath72 . for fixed @xmath73",
    "the divergent behavior is strongest close to the resonance at ( @xmath74 ) @xmath75 in view of ( [ defdelta ] ) @xmath46 can be roughly estimated by setting the right hand side of ( [ lemgeprobe ] ) equal to @xmath76 of its maximal size , i.e @xmath77 hence @xmath78    for a rough estimate of the decay time @xmath55 we set @xmath79 and use ( [ tautime ] ) , ( [ knull ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "this yields in units of @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "( [ tau ] ) ) @xmath81",
    "we turn now to the experimental verifications and prior discussions in the theoretical physics literature .",
    "the experimental verification of apc has been sought in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) ( but without success so far @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "the adiabatic time scale on which the field increases is directly determined by the relative speed with which the heavy ions approach each other and one computes that @xmath4 is of order @xmath82 @xcite",
    ". theoretical work on hic was extensively done @xcite .",
    "while the basic idea , namely to find the shape of @xmath83 ( c.f . [ lemgeprobe ] ) , has been seen before , the correct form and meaning of @xmath83 has not been arrived at .",
    "furthermore the analogue of our formula ( [ lemgeprobe ] ) has been interpreted as breit wigner shape , yet another source for false rates .    using ( [ zeitskala ] )",
    "the rigorous estimate taking into account the time dependence of the external field , yields @xmath85 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence if the field stays overcritical for times much larger than @xmath86 the probability of pair creation is one , in the adiabatic case this is well satisfied .",
    "thus hic - apc is theoretically proven .",
    "an interesting prediction is the shape of the momentum distribution of the created positron",
    ". it would be nice if the shape would be simply the resonance ( [ lemgeprobe ] ) as suggested e.g. in @xcite .",
    "but that requires a somewhat different situation than what one has in hic .",
    "it would require an overcritical static field ( adiabatic is not enough ) of a life time much larger than the decay time @xmath55 .",
    "then in fact the resonance ( [ lemgeprobe ] ) would stay more or less intact ( see also @xcite ) . in an adiabatically changing field the resonance ( [ lemgeprobe ] ) changes however with the field and it is highly unclear how .",
    "another experimental situation with adiabatically changing fields is provided by lasers . for laser fields ( wavelength @xmath87 ) @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the compton wave length of the electron .",
    "it is in fact hoped , that pair creation can be seen in a new generation of lasers which are able to create in focus a very well localized overcritical classical field .",
    "unfortunately this hope is intermingled with misconceptions which we shall try to sort out .",
    "let us review shortly the present status of the discussion on the possibility of creating pairs in laser fields .",
    "an early computation by schwinger @xcite predicted a pair creation rate for a constant strong electric field . in that case",
    "the rate for small fields is exponentially small .",
    "this is because pair creation arises in a similar manner as in the klein paradox tunnelling , where `` negative energy states '' overlap with their exponentially small tails the `` positive energy states '' @xcite .",
    "one can picture the situation by `` tilting '' the spectral gap ( of figure [ pair ] ) under the influence of the electric field ) so that wave functions `` can reach across '' . as a rule of thumb the critical electric field @xmath90",
    "which one needs is estimated by the potential energy the electron acquires over a distance of roughly the compton - wave length : @xmath91 .",
    "the schwinger computation is certainly correct but of course has nothing to do with lasers .",
    "the schwinger - computation has been generalized by brezin and itzykson to time varying but spatially constant electric fields @xcite .",
    "that generalization did not change the rates for pair creation as computed by schwinger .",
    "they are still determined by klein - paradox tunnelling across the `` tilted '' spectral gap . but",
    "brezin and itzykson apply now their results to laser fields .",
    "their argument is , that while laser fields are not of the type of the electric potential field they treat ( a field of a huge capacitor with plates infinitely far apart ) since they have magnetic parts as well , their field strength should be at least a lower bound to the strength of a realistic laser field which would be able to create pairs . that the magnetic part of the laser field can be neglected is not much argued for , except that it is bluntly stated that pure magnetic fields can not create pairs . in @xcite",
    "one finds a perturbation argument from which it is also concluded that pair creation is an `` electric effect '' . as a note aside",
    "it is also folklore wisdom that a single electro magnetic wave can not produce pairs , it is therefore standardly assumed that at least two laser fields are superposed so that in the focal region a standing wave is formed .",
    "the brezin - itzykson reduction of a laser field to an electric potential field became the basis of all further theoretical research on laser pair creation ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "what is wrong with all that ?",
    "firstly we recall that the brezin - itzykson treatment was intended to discourage hopes for seeing pair creation with optical lasers .",
    "they actually say that they would not have trusted their bound if it would have turned out lower than what they got .",
    "the moral which should be drawn is simply : the true lower bound can and will be much higher than what brezin - itzykson found .",
    "in fact we shall argue later that no lower bound exists . in reverse",
    ", it is not a priori clear at all that pair creation is determined by the maximal value of the present @xmath92-field .",
    "what is clear however is that that treatment gives wrong results when applied to a single overcritical laser beam , where no pair creation occurs .",
    "therefore if the brezin - itzykson treatment is thought to be of relevance for superposed laser fields an argument is truly needed , but none has been given .",
    "secondly we wish to emphasize the obvious , namely that the talk about electric fields in the context of quantum mechanics and in particular in the context of pair creation can be misleading : only the four - vector - potential enters in the dirac equation .",
    "descriptions in terms of the _ local _ behavior of the @xmath93 or @xmath94 fields may therefore lead off the track .",
    "( this is similar to the role of the @xmath95 and @xmath96 field in the aharonov bohm effect ) . in particular laser fields",
    "must not be modelled by a constant electric field .",
    "the @xmath95-fields with @xmath97 ( in coulomb gauge ) differs from the @xmath95-field where only @xmath98 ( in coulomb gauge ) in all respects .",
    "in particular it is important to take the full geometry of the laser field into account .",
    "one moral of apc is that pair creation is a `` global '' effect , i.e. the global @xmath99 and @xmath100 dependence of the field plays a role : criticality has to be defined via the bound states of the _",
    "potential_. weather there is a bound state at the edge or not depends on the full @xmath99-dependence on that field , not on the maximal @xmath92-field only . in apc",
    "the pair creation behavior of an ( slightly ) overcritical external potential is qualitatively different from the pair creation behavior of an ( slightly ) undercritical potential , though their `` local '' @xmath92- and @xmath101-fields ( in particular their maximal @xmath92-field ) may be almost the same .",
    "that clearly contradicts the assumption that the pair creation rate is given by the maximal @xmath92-field only .",
    "a related point arising from the global nature of apc is that perturbative treatments are highly questionable @xcite .",
    "let us now return to the crucial question : does there exist a gap - bridge for laser fields ?",
    "the electric part of a laser field is not a gradient of an electric potential and unfit for the job to lift a ground state from the lower to the upper continuum .",
    "what about taking the laser field seriously , considering also the magnetic part of the field ?",
    "the magnetic field , in particular the _ spin - magnetic field interaction _ provides in fact an adiabatically changing potential as apc requires .",
    "unfortunately that does not work either . for constant @xmath101- fields",
    "it is already known that no gap - bridge exists ( see @xcite and @xcite for a rigorous statement ) .",
    "we give the simple argument now for the more general case of fields with varying magnitude but fixed direction .",
    "the argument shows that typically a gap - bridge does not exist for the dirac equation _ without electric potential ( @xmath97 in coulomb gauge ) _ ,",
    "i.e. that they do not exist for laser fields .",
    "in fact we argue that there is no bridge crossing the spectral value zero !",
    "starting with the eigenvalue equation for the dirac operator and writing @xmath102 we compute @xmath103 this then yields @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the schrdinger operator with vector potential @xmath106 in coulomb gauge ( @xmath107 ) . by simple @xmath108-algebra",
    "we have that @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath111-unit matrix , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "now we assume that the magnetic field @xmath114 has constant direction ( as it is the case in a standing wave ) , i.e. @xmath115 with constant matrix @xmath116 and real function @xmath117 giving the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "using this and @xmath97 we have that @xmath118 we go to the eigenspaces of the matrix @xmath119 setting @xmath120 .",
    "note here , that @xmath121 commutes with @xmath122 for @xmath123 and that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath119 are @xmath124 @xmath125 ( note aside that in physical units @xmath126 is the magnetic moment . ) from this we see that the energy curve of the schrdinger operator @xmath127 must be quadratically zero if there is a gap bridge of the corresponding dirac operator crossing zero .",
    "this however is a very special behavior of eigenvalues and thus unlikely .",
    "( see @xcite where a famous special case is actually discussed . )",
    "one may conclude that gap bridges do not occur at all for laser fields . on the other hand if @xmath128 this argument breaks down and a gap bridge may exist .",
    "our first conclusion is thus : no matter how tricky laser waves are superposed and how strong the fields may be , no gap - bridge arises and pair creation will at most be exponentially small in @xmath13 .",
    "note however , that we made an external field approximation in our treatment .",
    "considering self interaction effects , in particular the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , a gap bridge may arise for @xmath101 fields which are more than a few thousand times overcritical @xcite .",
    "our second conclusion is however : since the magnetic field in junction with a coulomb field can produce a gap bridge , a new ( and possibly the only one using lasers ) experimental possibility for apc arises .",
    "we propose to combine laser- and heavy ion fields , i.e. to shoot heavy ions into the focus of the laser .",
    "we model the laser field by an oscillating magnetic field @xmath101 constant in space .",
    "first let us explain , why this model is satisfied for the present situation .",
    "as mentioned above , descriptions in terms of @xmath92 and @xmath101 fields may be misleading , so let us model the vector potential of the laser .",
    "in coulomb - gauge the vector potential has no @xmath129-component .",
    "since the vector potential of an optical laser varies for a given time only slightly over the range of the heavy ion potential the laser - field is in good approximation given by its first order taylor expansion around the center of the nucleus .",
    "note , that in coulomb - gauge the zero - order term of the vector potential is zero .",
    "hence the leading order term of the vector potential is the first order term , which has ( in coulomb gauge ) no gradient and can thus be written in the form @xmath130 for some @xmath114 constant in space , oscillating in time .",
    "thus the vector potential of the laser is in good approximation the potential of a spatially constant magnetic field in the situation at hand .    in @xcite",
    "an estimate ( actually a lower and upper bound ) for the the critical strength of a ( spatially constant ) magnetic field which has a gap bridge in presence of a nucleus with charge @xmath131 is given .",
    "instead of estimating the lower bound on the @xmath132-field needed in junction with the ion field to have apc we translate the corresponding lower bounds to the laser electric field strength @xmath133 .",
    "this enables us to have easy comparison with the results given by the laser community .",
    "we should however warn the reader that we use here the the lower bound of @xcite because it is computable number , while the ( reliable ) upper bound is not sharp defined .",
    ".[tabelle ] the table gives an estimated lower bound on the electric field strength of a laser for a gap bridge , when a nucleus with charge @xmath131 is in the focus of the laser .",
    "the lower bound @xmath134 is given in units of the critical schwinger field strength @xmath90 . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lower bound is @xmath135 , i.e. only if the electric field strength @xmath136 fulfills @xmath137 one can expect that apc takes place . in table",
    "[ tabelle ] we list the values for @xmath133 for three different nuclei in units @xmath90 .",
    "we recall that @xmath138 ( the critical field strength given by schwinger ) is the critical field strength where the respective @xmath96-field in a light wave satisfies @xmath139 . for uranium",
    "this yields that the field has to be two times overcritical ( see table [ tabelle ] ) .",
    "laser fields which are a few times overcritical are expected to be reached by a new generation of lasers , called xfel ( see e.g. @xcite ) . bringing a heavy ion ( like uranium ) into the focus of such a laser apc should be observable .",
    "in fact , the transition from no pairs to periodic ( twice per laser period ) appearance of pairs when the laser field becomes strong enough ( twice overcritical , according to table [ tabelle ] ) is very much like a phase transition ."
