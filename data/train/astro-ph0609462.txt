    "included in the discoveries are dozens of systems with a noticeable emission line of , which is often a signature of a white dwarf with a high magnetic field .",
    "the highest field systems ( polars ) have no accretion disk and the white dwarf spin is synchronized to the orbit . the intermediate polars ( ips )",
    "usually have some outer disk , with magnetic curtains channelling the inner disk material to the magnetic poles of the white dwarf which is spinning faster than the orbital timescale .",
    "polars can be identified by circular polarization , cyclotron harmonics and/or zeeman splitting ( review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while ips are found through the detection of their spin and orbital periods . in addition , there is a class of high accretion rate disk systems with possible low magnetic field white dwarfs @xcite , termed sw sex stars , which can also show strong lines in their optical spectra .    for the last few years",
    ", we have used _ xmm - newton _  to identify the nature of the cvs with and to explore the nature of x - ray heating in these systems .",
    "polars generally exhibit hard x - rays from the accretion shock and soft x - rays from the white dwarf surface heated by the hard x - rays .",
    "the ratio of soft to hard x - rays shows a dramatic change with magnetic field strength and accretion rate .",
    "the ips are generally hard x - ray emitters with large absorption effects from the accretion curtains .",
    "usually the spin period is much more pronounced in the x - ray than the optical .",
    "the sw sex stars usually show no x - ray variation and are hard x - ray emitters with low absorption .",
    "the 3 sources in this study are all about 18th mag in the sdss @xmath2 filter and were all identified as potential magnetic cvs in @xcite .",
    "sdssj144659.95 + 025330.3 ( hereafter sdssj1446 + 02 ) showed no polarization and limited time - resolved spectra could not determine the orbital period .",
    "sdssj205017.85053626.8 ( sdssj205005 ) has the strongest line of the 3 objects , with a peak flux comparable to h@xmath3 and showed evidence of high and low states of mass transfer .",
    "a short span of time - resolved spectroscopy showed an orbital period near 2 hrs .",
    "followup high speed photometry by @xcite revealed brief ( 260s ) , deep ( 1.5 mag ) eclipses and determined a precise period of 1.57 hrs .",
    "the third system , sdssj210131.26 + 105251.5 ( sdssj2101 + 10 ) has very strong balmer lines but did not show any velocity variation during 1.3 hr of time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data obtained on these 3 sources , combined with additional photometry , spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry has allowed us to determine that sdssj1446 + 02  is an ip , sdssj205005  is a likely polar , while sdssj2101 + 10  escapes an easy classification , but appears most likely to be an sw sex star . our observations and results",

    "for all sources the background contributed less than 3% of the flux within the source aperture , hence simpler fitting of background subtracted spectra was deemed acceptable . at the very lowest energies the calibration of the epic detectors remains uncertain ; following the latest guidelines we restricted our fitting to @xmath38kev for the mos and @xmath39kev for the pn . in every case , we performed joint fits to the data from all three x - ray cameras simultaneously , where all model parameters were fixed apart from the relative normalization of the pn relative to the mos ( which were assumed to be identical ) . in the cases where we separated the data into two phase or time bins",
    ", we then had 6 datasets .",
    "starting from the case where all relative normalizations , as well as other model parameters , were kept constant , we then allowed normalizations to vary ( but keeping the mos to pn ratios constant ) , and then other model parameters like temperature , @xmath40-testing to see whether the additional degrees of freedom were statistically warranted each time .",
    "the best fits we present in figures and tables are those where the model has the fewest free parameters ( i.e. leaves the most degrees of freedom ) ; any further freeing of parameters did not then signficantly reduce the ( reduced ) @xmath37 values .",
    "furthermore , in finding the best fit models we always started from the simplest single emission component , solely absorbed by interstellar dust , with an initial value for @xmath41 as predicted by dust maps for the appropriate line of sight through the galaxy . typically , we used a single bremsstrahlung or a version including explicit line emission the xspec model mekal as expected for the optically thin thermally - emitting plasma encountered in cvs . in all cases",
    ", these simplest models failed to provide a good fit , hence we moved onto a variety of more complex combinations , e.g. multi - temperature or two - temperature thermal plasmas , additional soft blackbody components ( as emitted by the heated polar caps in polars ) and the effects of local partial covering absorption ( i.e. due to obscuration by the accretion stream and/or curtain ) .",

    ". because the period is so close to the length of the observation , it is not a robust determination , but useful in showing that the orbital period is not short ( i.e. under 2 hrs ) .    for sdssj1446 + 02",
    "we also possess four optical lightcurves ( two from the ground and two from the om ) , plus those from the epic x - ray cameras . to maximize signal - to - noise we summed the results from the two mos ; however , since these are always of longer duration than the pn , we did not combine pn and mos at this stage .",
    "we performed a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite analysis of each of our lightcurves . in every case ,",
    "a significant peak was found at a period of 49 min , which we identify as the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "in addition , longer term variations were apparent in the optical lightcurves with peaks corresponding to around 4 hrs , close to the signal found in the time - resolved apo spectra . to determine the periods most accurately , we used sinusoidal fitting to the longest 2003 may 7 nofs lightcurve , with a sinusoid plus first harmonic model for the pulse , and a simple sinusoid for the longer period variation .",
    "this yielded a period of @xmath69d ( @xmath0 min ) for the pulse , and @xmath70d ( @xmath71hr ) for the longer period , which we presume to be the orbital period of the system .",
    "once again we caution that the 2003 may curve provides only 1.3 cycles coverage of our tentative orbital period , and it remains poorly constrained .",
    "nevertheless , we then fit the other three optical curves with sinusoids constrained to the pulse and orbital periods , and subtracted the latter . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1446optlcs ] we show the two resulting nofs lightcurves ; the pulse profile is obvious in most cycles in the 2003 may curve , whereas in 2004 jan there is far more scatter , especially away from minimum light .",
    "this may simply be due to varying amounts of flickering , perhaps indicative of small changes in accretion state .",
    "lastly , we phase folded ( and binned ) the light curves on the pulse period to examine its profile in greater detail .",
    "the binned results are shown ( along with the x - ray ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1446bfs ] .",
    "the profile is clearly far from sinusoidal , having a relatively broad and flat - topped peak , and narrower v - shaped minimum .    before",
    "phase - folding the x - ray data , we created five different energy selected lightcurves , in order to investigate any dependence of the pulse profile on energy .",
    "the final binned lightcurves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1446bfs ] were constructed by summing the _ folded _ and binned results for all three x - ray cameras to maximize signal - to - noise . perhaps not too surprising , the profile of the x - ray pulse is very different from the optical , but it is noteworthy that the x - ray and optical are neither in phase nor anti - phased . instead , the peak of the x - ray roughly leads that of the optical by @xmath10.3 in phase .",
    "the x - ray pulse is also energy dependent , with the largest amplitude ( and symmetrical peaked pulse ) in the two lowest energy bins ,",
    "the amplitude then decreases with energy , until above 5 kev there is no significant variation .",
    "the variation in pulse amplitude with energy is exactly that which we would expect if obscuration by a local absorber is responsible . in fitting the x - ray spectra",
    ", we first found a fit to the entire dataset , but then applied this model separately to spectra phase - selected from the maximum ( @xmath72 ) and minimum ( @xmath73 ) flux intervals of the pulse profile .",
    "the details of the fits are given in table  [ tab:1446xfits ] .",
    "the model that has the best fit consists of a two - temperature thermal plasma ( mekal ) , absorbed both by a small galactic column , but also by a much larger variable partial covering absorber .",
    "the fit to the combined spectrum achieved a barely acceptable reduced @xmath74 for 134 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , though it does better than any other model .",
    "this model has a well - constrained cool plasma of @xmath75ev contributing unresolved soft emission line structure plus a very hot component whose temperature pegged at 80 kev , the upper limit for the mekal  model .",
    "furthermore , the values of the galactic and local columns were very poorly constrained .",
    "this is probably an effect of trying to fit a highly phase - variable spectrum with a single model ( even this fairly complex one ) . indeed , after separating the data into `` max '' and `` min '' subsets , a joint fit to these spectra was a significant improvement ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1446xspec ] ) .",
    "there was not a significant change in the reduced @xmath37 , but we were now able to find well - constrained values for the absorbing columns and a physically plausible temperature for the hottest mekal  component of @xmath76kev .",
    "once again the fit required a very cool mekal  to account for line structure in the 0.30.4 kev range , plus emission at 0.56 kev ; indeed this parameter now pegged at its minimum value of 81 ev , indicating that some problems still remain ( but the need for a very cool plasma is less problematic than an unphysically hot one , given the physical conditions in the expected complex multi - temperature accretion column ) . in this fit , the partial covering absorber parameters for the `` max '' tended to zero , hence we fixed them as such ; the `` min '' interval as expected requires a thick column around @xmath77@xmath78 , with 61% covering fraction .",
    "in our joint fit we found no statistical support for varying any of the normalization parameters ; the change between `` max '' and `` min '' is entirely accounted for by the introduction of the thick partial covering absorber . therefore , the fully unabsorbed flux ( 0.0110 kev ) remains constant at @xmath79 , whereas the affect of the absorption leads to clear energy - dependent changes in the observed fluxes : a drop of 60% ( @xmath80 ) in the softest 0.22.0 kev band ; a decrease of only 30% ( @xmath81 ) in the 2.05.0 kev ; and no significant change in the flux above 5 kev .",
    "the eclipses seen in the optical photometry of @xcite are also very apparent in the x - ray lightcurves , and in our @xmath22-band om results .",
    "their ephemeris is sufficiently precise that there is merely a 0.01 cycle uncertainty at the time of our _ xmm - newton _  observations . adding our own eclipse center measurements",
    ", we are able to even further refine the ephemeris to : @xmath82 where the numbers in parenthesis indicate the @xmath83 uncertainty in the last digit .",
    "also , note that the time is given in terrestrial time ( ut = tt+64.184  s at the present epoch ) .    besides the eclipses , the x - ray lightcurves exhibit large amplitude but apparently irregular flaring behaviour .",
    "we divided the x - ray data into two energy bins , above and below 1.6 kev , roughly encompassing the same count rates , then phase - folded the lightcurves and we plot them in fig .  [ fig:2050fds ] , where we also plot each cycle of data with a different symbol ( and color in the electronic edition ) .",
    "although this energy division is not physically motivated , it does roughly separate the energies severely affected by photo - electric absorption from those little affected ( as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2050xspec ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that the soft band does include contributions from physically distinct x - ray emission regions the heated white dwarf surface , and the accretion column which should be borne in mind in any interpretations of the lightcurves .",
    "we see that the flaring does not repeat in each orbit , and that it is far more significant below 1.6 kev .",
    "the over - plotted binned data ( stepped line ) bring out the average orbital modulations more clearly .",
    "at the higher energies , there appears to be a broad peak , cut unevenly by the eclipse , whereas at lower energies , the rise in flux to peak does not occur until phase 0 . as we did for sdssj1446 + 02 , we undertook x - ray spectral fitting to both the complete dataset , and two phase - selected intervals , here dubbed `` peak '' and `` trough '' , excluding the eclipse phase : these regions are also indicated in fig .",

    "[ fig:2101lcs ] ) for periodicities .",
    "unfortunately , the _ xmm - newton _  data span only @xmath11.5 hr , and even the nofs lightcurve is only 3.5 hrs long , limiting our sensitivity to any modulations with periods much in excess of 2 hours . moreover , the variability in both x - ray and optical bands appears extremely complex .",
    "the longest , nofs optical , curve appears to show two distinct humps at around 0.87 and 0.94 ( truncated hjd(tt ) ) , but of course even here only two cycles are present . running a phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) period - folding search on this light curve , we find three signals , but the lowest frequency one is close to the inverse of the data time span , and is therefore unreliable .",
    "this leaves minima at around 13.5 d@xmath7 ( 107 min ) and 26.4d@xmath7 ( 55 min ) , which are close to being harmonically related to each other . in figure  [ fig:2101temp ]",
    "we show the pdm for the nofs lightcurve and the lightcurve folded on the two candidate periodicities .",
    "the fold on the longer period confirms the repeatability of the aforementioned humps : only at phases ( arbitrary ) 0.250.5 do the two cycles agree ; but the fold is also somewhat double - humped , with possibly a second interval of higher flux at around 0.9 , although here there is a large amount of scatter .",
    "folding on 54 min the points line up along an approximately sinusoidal curve , but again there is significant scatter about this mean at all phases .",
    "furthermore , for this shorter period we can usefully interrogate the om and mos light curves : their pdms are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2101temp ] ; no strong signals appear around 54 min .",
    "lllll mekal & 0.82 ( 95 ) & 7.1 ( fixed ) & @xmath113 & + mekal & 0.80 ( 94 ) & @xmath114 & @xmath115 & + 2 @xmath48 mekal & 0.77 ( 92 ) & @xmath116 & @xmath117&@xmath118 + multi-@xmath48 mekal & 0.75 ( 93 ) & @xmath119 & @xmath120&@xmath121 +    returning to fig .  [ fig:2101lcs ] : in order to consider the nofs periods",
    "further we have over - plotted vertical bars to mark phase 0.0 and 0.5 of a 107 min period , arranging the time axes for the _ xmm - newton _  and nofs observations to yield phase agreement ( only 4 cycles elapse between the two sets of observations ) .",
    "we see that the repeatable nofs humps agree in phase and approximate form with a hump in the om lightcurve .",
    "however , at other phases agreement is lost , in particular another peak precedes the major hump in the om , possibly correlated with a similar x - ray peak in fact .",
    "ignoring the high frequency flickering in the x - ray lightcurves , there is possibly a slower variation on the @xmath1100 min timescale , though of course we have no way to test whether this behaviour actually repeats .    in the absence of any decisive periods",
    ", we simply fit models to the complete x - ray spectrum .",
    "these are detailed in table  [ tab:2101xfits ] .",
    "a range of emission components from a single fairly cool mekal  ( @xmath122kev ) , to a multi - temperature version with @xmath123kev provide adequate fits , all with a single absorbing component with @xmath124@xmath78 consistent with the galactic line - of - sight maximum .",
    "an example fit to the spectra is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2101xspec ] ; the resulting unabsorbed 0.0110 kev flux is @xmath125 .",
    "all the observational evidence indicates that sdssj1446 + 02  is a short period ip .",
    "a classic signature of ips is the presence of multiple periodicities in their lightcurves . for sdssj1446 + 02",
    "we find that both its optical and x - ray fluxes are strongly modulated at a short 49 min period , and there is evidence for an additional optical modulation at 4 hrs .",
    "this latter periodicity also appears in the h@xmath64 radial velocity curve .",
    "however , more extensive photometric and spectroscopic runs are needed to confirm these , and hence secure the determination of the orbital period .",
    "the identification of the 49 min modulation with the spin period of an asynchronously rotating white dwarf is much more secure : the characteristic energy dependence of the x - ray flux modulation , and our simple phase - selected spectral fitting confirm that the variation in flux is dominated by changes in the local absorbing column .",
    "this is exactly as seen in many other ips , as a result of the extended accretion curtain intersecting our line - of - site to the x - ray emitting accretion column .",
    "the underlying x - ray emission can be fit with that emitted by a two - temperature optically thin plasma , i.e. bremsstrahlung .",
    "no doubt this simple model only approximates what must be a complex multi - temperature shock region in the accretion column , however the hotter component with @xmath126kev indicates the upper limit to the temperatures therein ; again this value is typical of ips .    assuming that @xmath127hr",
    ", we find a ratio of @xmath128 , placing sdssj1446 + 02  well - within the group of so - called conventional ips , as defined by @xmath129 and @xmath130hr @xcite . in all respects the observed properties of sdssj1446 + 02  are consistent with a garden - variety ip .",
    "the observational evidence favors a polar classification for sdssj205005 .",
    "one spectropolarimetric observation found significant circular polarization that increases to @xmath33 for @xmath131   .",
    "this result suggests that the strongest cyclotron harmonics may lie in the near - ir , and thus that the magnetic field is relatively low , @xmath132  mg , or that the specific accretion rate in the cyclotron - emitting portions of the funnel(s ) is relatively low , @xmath133  g @xmath78 , or both .",
    "no cyclotron harmonics are evident in either the total flux or circular polarization spectra , consistent with a high temperature shock",
    ". therefore , sdss j2050@xmath2805 is probably not a low - accretion rate polar @xcite , where mass - transfer appears to occur not via roche - lobe overflow , but rather by efficient magnetic capture of the secondary star s stellar wind .    in support of the above interpretation , the x - ray spectra of sdss j2050@xmath2805 are well - fit by a two - temperature thermal plasma model ( mekal ) , but in addition the data require a soft blackbody component . in this case , the two mekal  components have temperatures of 1 and 41 kev respectively , once again likely indicating the limits of the range of temperatures present in the optically thin emitting plasma , both quite typical for polars .",
    "the blackbody has a temperature of about 30 ev , again within the observed range for polars . in the `` peak '' region ,",
    "this cool blackbody component , arising from the heated surface of the white dwarf , contributes about 40 percent of the unabsorbed 0.01 - 10 kev flux . in terms of the energy balance , assuming an x - ray albedo for the white dwarf surface of @xmath134 and that the cyclotron contribution to the energy losses is negligible , one finds @xmath135 , which given uncertainties in estimating the unabsorbed soft flux is comparable to recent measures of the energy balance in other actively accreting polars .    as an eclipsing system , the orbital period is very well - established . in the x - ray lightcurves",
    "we again see eclipses , but the remainder of the variability is complex .",
    "it is dominated by aperiodic flickering behavior , which is strongest in the softer x - ray flux ( below 1.6 kev ) . in an attempt to discover any underlying modulation on the orbital period , we created phase - binned light curves averaging over the three cycles of data .",
    "what remains appears quite typical of a polar , in which one accretion pole is always visible ( i.e. no white dwarf self - eclipse ) .",
    "this produces emission modulated on the orbitally - synchronized white dwarf spin period , since the projected area of the emitting region changes with phase .",
    "the fact that only the normalization of the hotter thermal emission component appears to vary between `` peak '' and `` trough '' spectra is probably simply owing to poor statistics for the much smaller contributions from the cooler mekal  and soft blackbody components .",
    "the shape of the average , non - eclipse harder x - ray ( @xmath136kev ) lightcurve is indeed approximately sinusoidal , whereas in the soft band the lightcurve does not rise until after the eclipse , i.e. its flux remains low in the phase range @xmath137 .",
    "the energy - dependence of this feature suggests that photo - electric absorption may be the cause .",
    "indeed , the spectrum for the @xmath138 `` trough '' phase interval does require a fairly high column , which partially covers the x - ray emission .",
    "such pre - eclipse energy - dependent dipping structure is seen in many other eclipsing polars e.g. ep dra , hu aqr and uz for @xcite . in the high - quality soft x - ray lightcurves of hu aqr ,",
    "there is one broad dip centered on phase 0.7 and a narrower feature at around 0.9 .",
    "these are interpreted as arising from the accretion column obscuring the nearby heated photosphere of the white dwarf , while the more distant accretion stream accounts for the sharper dip , indeed the width and azimuth of this dip can be related to the geometry of the region where the stream threads onto the white dwarf s magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , given the quality of our own data ( both lacking the high signal - to - noise and afflicted by the flaring ) we can not identify the dipping components , and hence probe the accretion flow in greater detail ; and of course from our spectral fitting we know that the soft flux arises both from the white dwarf and various parts of the accretion column , which would further complicate a more detailed analysis .",
    "although originally identified as a candidate mcv , given the strength of its high - excitation optical emission lines , the follow - up observations of sdssj2101 + 10  we have presented do not seem to confirm this classification .",
    "we find no strong modulation of its x - ray flux , quite unlike any polar , for instance sdssj205005 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum also does not require any absorption in excess of the estimated galactic column , effectively ruling out a typical ip .",
    "the x - ray emission is describable by a variety of thermal plasma ( mekal ) models , though with a noticeably lower maximum temperature ( @xmath139 or at most 25 kev ) than is found in most mcvs or indeed in our fits to sdssj1446 + 02or sdssj205005 .",
    "this cooler plasma is in fact far more typical of disk - accreting systems .",
    "only the sw sex stars show with strength comparable to the magnetics ; both the lack of absorption in the line profiles and their barely detectable radial velocities could be accounted for by a low inclination to our line - of - sight .",
    "we have reported on observations allowing classification of three new sdss cvs showing prominent : sdssj1446 + 02 , sdssj205005  and sdssj2101 + 10 .",
    "each represents a different class of cv , known to exhibit such high excitation emission lines .",
    "sdssj1446 + 02  is a clear example of an ip .",
    "we find two periodicities at about 4 hr and 49 min , arising respectively from the orbit and asynchronously spinning white dwarf .",
    "the x - ray spectrum comprises a multi - temperature thermal plasma , with a maximum of 60 kev , modulated by phase - dependent local absorption .",
    "this likely originates from obscuration by the accretion curtains formed by the accreting material as it flows between the disrupted disc and the magnetic poles of the white dwarf .",
    "sdssj205005  represents the most highly magnetized of the three , a fully spin - orbit synchronized polar , with an orbital period of 1.57 hr . in this case",
    "no disk forms , and all accretion is channeled along the field lines to a single dominant pole .",
    "owing to its high inclination , there is a phase interval when the accretion stream obscures the x - ray emitting region , but most of the modulation on the spin / orbit appears consistent with simply its changing aspect .",
    "the x - ray emission has two components : the dominant one is characteristic of the post - shock bremsstrahlung - cooled optically thin plasma of the accretion column , here with temperatures ranging from 1 kev to 40 kev ; this also heats the surface of the white dwarf leading to additional soft blackbody ( 30 ev ) emission .    in sdssj2101 + 10 , we suggest that the combination of high accretion rate and lower magnetic field strength allows disk - mediated accretion , but also the formation of emission lines in the optical spectra , i.e. if it were at higher inclination it would appear as a classic sw sex star . its x - ray spectra indicate a rather cool thermal plasma ( @xmath110 kev ) more typical of disk systems , and an unobscured line of sight , inconsistent with an ip . from only weak modulation",
    "( unlike a polar ) of its x - ray and optical lightcurves we suggest an orbital period in the 100 min range .",
