    "one of the most prominent is the scattering approach proposed by brouwer who presented a formula that relates the pumped current to the parametric derivatives of the scattering matrix of the system . driven by adiabatic and weak modulation ( the ac driving amplitude is small compared to the static potential ) , the pumped current was found to vary in a sinusoidal manner as a function of the phase difference between the two oscillating potentials .",
    "it increases linearly with the frequency in line with experimental finding .",
    "although the quantum pump has been extensively discussed in literature , little attention was paid to experimentally observed deviation from the weak - pumping theory with only the first - order parametric derivative of the scattering matrix considered .",
    "we improved the scattering approach by expanding the scattering matrix to higher orders of the time and modulation amplitude , which enables us to go further in investigation of the problem .",
