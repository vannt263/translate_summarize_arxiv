    "the casimir effect has important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear , and has become in recent decades an increasingly popular topic in quantum field theory . since the original work by casimir @xcite many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , a great deal of attention received the investigations of quantum effects for cylindrical boundaries .",
    "in addition to traditional problems of quantum electrodynamics under the presence of material boundaries , the casimir effect for cylindrical geometries can also be important to the flux tube models of confinement @xcite and for determining the structure of the vacuum state in interacting field theories @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the vacuum energy of electromagnetic field with boundary conditions defined on a cylinder turned out to be technically a more involved problem than the analogous one for a sphere .",

    "this geometry is also interesting from the point of view of general analysis for surface divergences in the expectation values of local physical observables for boundaries with discontinuities .",

    "<S> the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor are investigated for a scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions and for the electromagnetic field inside a wedge with a coaxial cylindrical boundary . in the case of the electromagnetic field perfectly conducting boundary conditions are assumed on the bounding surfaces . by using the abel - plana - type formula for the series over the zeros of the bessel function , the vacuum expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of two terms . </S>",
    "<S> the first one corresponds to the geometry without a cylindrical boundary and the second one is induced by the presence of the cylindrical shell . </S>",
    "<S> the additional vacuum forces acting on the wedge sides due the presence of the cylindrical boundary are evaluated and it is shown that these forces are attractive for both scalar and electromagnetic fields .    </S>",
