    "therefore , gcs can be used as powerful test particles for studying the kinematics and chemical evolution of ge halos .    up to now",
    ", there are several kinematic studies of the gc systems in nearby ges : m49 @xcite , m60 @xcite , m87 @xcite , ngc 4636 @xcite , ngc 1399 @xcite , ngc 5128 @xcite , and ngc 1407 @xcite .",
    "the data used for these studies were compiled and reanalyzed in @xcite , who found that the kinematic properties of the gc systems are diverse among the ges , indicating diverse merging and accretion histories of ges ( see also the recent study on the m87 gc system @xcite ) .",
    "there are also several studies focusing on the spectroscopic ages and metallicities of the ge gcs : @xcite for m87 , @xcite and @xcite for m49 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for ngc 5128 , @xcite for m60 , @xcite for ngc 1407 , and @xcite and @xcite for ngc 1399 .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a study of spectroscopic ages and metallicities for the gcs in ngc 4636 .",

    "we have been carrying out a project to investigate the spectroscopic properties of gcs in nearby galaxies to understand the formation of the gc systems in galaxies .",
    "our study on the kinematics of the gc system of the virgo ge m60 was presented in @xcite and @xcite and that on the gc system of the spiral galaxy m31 in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the absence of spectroscopic studies , there have been several studies of the photometric properties of m86 gcs .",

    "the primary results are summarized in the final section .",
    "we selected the spectroscopic targets from a photometric sample of the gc candidates in m86 identified in washington @xmath7 images ( @xmath8 ) taken at the kpno 4 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the gcs in m86 appear as point sources in the ground - based kpno images , and we first selected point sources around m86 with colors of @xmath9 as gc candidates .",
    "this @xmath10 color selection criterion is effective in selecting gc candidates in early - type galaxies : the success rate of the photometric search for gcs is about 90% in the case of m87 @xcite , m49 @xcite , and ngc 4636 @xcite .",
    "we then selected from the bright sources with magnitudes @xmath11 as the spectroscopic targets .",
    "a total of 67 targets were chosen , which included the m86 nucleus and two known faint galaxies ( ngc 4406b , vcc 0833 ) .",
    "we also observed two red , bright point sources with @xmath12 to fill the mask gaps .",
    "we obtained spectra of the 67 targets from observations in the multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode of faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) at the subaru 8.2 m telescope on 2002 april 21 .",

    "the slit width along the dispersion axis was 0.8 , and the resulting spectral resolution was @xmath19 .",
    "we used three 1200 s exposures in mask - c and one 1800 s exposure in mask-1 .",
    "we also obtained the comparison spectra with th - ar lamps before and/or after each exposure .",
    "we used the focas long - slit spectroscopy mode to calibrate the flux , radial velocity , and metallicity .",
    "we observed a standard star , bd+33d2642 , for the flux calibration and five milky way ( mw ) gcs ( m5 , m13 , m92 , m107 , and ngc 6624 ) for the velocity and metallicity calibrations .",
    "we observed the mw gcs with stepping scan mode to sample an area larger than that covered by the slit by moving the slit along the dispersion direction .",
    "we observed these calibration targets during the same run and also used their spectra in the study of the ngc 4636 gcs @xcite .",
    "details of the long - slit mode observation are given in section 2.2 and table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we first applied basic processing techniques ( overscan correction , bias subtraction , and cosmic ray rejection ) to the ccd images using iraf tasks : the ccd images were obtained with a pair of 4k @xmath20 2k ccds .",
    "we used the @xmath21 task in idl @xcite to produce a large single image from a pair of ccd images and correct distortions in the optics .",

    "we could not extract the spectra of seven faint targets because of a low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the th - ar lamp spectra with @xmath2240 useful emission lines in the @xmath23    range . the typical @xmath24 error for this calibration",
    "is @xmath25  .",
    "the flux of the target spectra was calibrated using the flux standard star .",
    "sample flux - calibrated spectra of an m86 gc , a foreground star , and the m86 nucleus are shown in figure [ fig - spec ] .",
    "we classified the target ( i d 81 ) in panel ( b ) as a k2iii star because of the broad ( @xmath22300 ) absorption feature around the mgb index .",
    "this feature is typically seen in the k giant star templates @xcite but not in gc templates .",
    "several absorption lines typically seen in old stellar systems including the g band , h@xmath26 , and mgb are clearly visible in the m86 gc spectrum in panel ( a ) .",
    "absorption features in the spectrum of the m86 nucleus are much broader than those in the gc and star because of its large velocity dispersion .",
    "we measured the radial velocities for the targets using the fourier cross - correlation task , iraf / fxcor @xcite .",
    "a wavelength range of @xmath27    was used for the cross - correlation because of the low s / n at @xmath28    and the strong night sky emission line [ o i ] at 5577  . during the cross - correlation",
    ", we fit the continuum of the spectra using a spline function with a @xmath29 clipping for the low level and a @xmath30 clipping for the high level .",
    "radial velocities were measured for each target using the five mw gc templates ; velocities for m86 gcs derived from the m5 , m13 , m92 , and ngc 6624 templates are consistent within @xmath31 , but those from the m107 template differ by @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , an error - weighted average of the first four measurements was taken to give the final radial velocity for each target . the error in the measured radial velocity",
    "is estimated as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the error in each measurement .",
    "the final number of targets with measured radial velocities is 31 .",
    "the radial velocities for 36 objects among the original 67 could not be determined because of the poor quality of the spectra .",
    "we determined the radial velocity of the m86 nucleus to be @xmath34  = @xmath35 km s@xmath1 , which is consistent with the previous measurement @xmath34  = @xmath36 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we also measured the radial velocities for two faint galaxies : @xmath34  = @xmath37 km s@xmath1 for vcc 0833 and @xmath34  = @xmath38 km s@xmath1 for ngc 4406b .",
    "these values are also consistent with previous measurements ( sloan digital sky survey and @xcite ) .",
    "errors in our velocity measurements range from 20 to 90 km s@xmath1  with a mean error of @xmath39 km s@xmath1 .",
    "to identify genuine m86 gcs among the 31 objects with measured velocities , we used the @xmath40  colors and the radial velocities .",
    "the @xmath40  colors are plotted as a function of the radial velocity in figure [ fig - vpct1 ] ; note that the m86 nucleus and two faint galaxies are not included in the plot .",
    "the velocity distribution in panel ( b ) shows that all objects have velocities of 900 to + 300 km s@xmath1   except for one object with very a large velocity of @xmath34  @xmath41 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we consider the objects with @xmath42 @xmath34  @xmath43 km",
    "s@xmath1   and @xmath44 @xmath40  @xmath45 to be genuine gcs bound to m86 ( the velocity of the m86 nucleus is @xmath46 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath40   color range is equivalent to a metallicity range of @xmath472.24 @xmath48  [ fe / h ]  @xmath48 0.33 dex @xcite . among the 28 objects ( excluding the m86 nucleus and two faint galaxies ) two",
    "do not satisfy the gc selection criteria .",
    "one target ( i d 226 ) is classified as a star because its color is too red , @xmath40  @xmath49 , even though it satisfies the velocity criterion .",
    "the other target ( i d 446 ) satisfies the color criterion but does not satisfy the velocity criterion : @xmath34  @xmath50 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this object seems to be an intracluster gc in the virgo cluster .",
    "because the systemic velocity of m86 is similar to the radial velocities of the mw stars , there could be some mw stars that satisfy our gc selection criteria . to remove these stars",
    ", we performed a careful visual inspection of the target spectra .",
    "we found one object ( i d 81 ) with stellar spectral features ( see section [ datared ] and figure [ fig - spec ] ( b ) ) and rejected it from the m86 gc catalog .",
    "thus , 25 genuine m86 gcs out of 28 targets excluding the m86 nucleus and two faint galaxies were identified .",
    "we note that there may be one or two more stars among the 25 gcs considering the selection efficiency for the gc candidates ( see section [ datasel ] ) .",
    "the reliability of our m86 gcs was further checked against the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ) source catalog @xcite .",
    "this catalog provides the classification probability for gc candidates in 100 virgo early - type galaxies .",
    "we found that eight gcs ( i d = 448 , 284 , 65 , 270 , 316 , 107 , 430 , and 324 ) among the 25 m86 gcs are included in the acsvcs catalog , and all of the eight have a gc probability larger than 90% , which confirms our classification .",
    "we show these eight gcs as open circles in figure [ fig - vpct1 ] .",
    "table [ tab - m86gc ] lists the photometric and spectroscopic data including the metallicities of 16 gcs using the bh method and the ages and metallicities of eight gcs using the grid method ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the first column represents identification number .",
    "the second and third columns give the right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) , respectively . the galactocentric radius and position angle",
    "are given in columns 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the magnitude and color information in columns 6 and 7 are from @xcite .",
    "the eighth column gives the radial velocity and its error measured in this study .",
    "the ninth and tenth columns give the age and metallicity derived from the grid method .",
    "the eleventh column gives the metallicity derived from the bh method .",
    "the final column indicates the corresponding mask from table [ tab - mask ] .",
    "the m86 gcs are listed first , followed by foreground stars , a probable intracluster gc , and the faint galaxies and m86 nucleus .",
    "the m86 gcs in our sample are found in a radial range of 42@xmath47446   ( i.e. , 3.4@xmath4736.1 kpc , see figure [ fig - t1image ] ) .",
    "the mean radial velocity for the 25 gcs determined with the biweight location of @xcite is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which is smaller than the radial velocity for the m86 nucleus ( @xmath2 km s@xmath1 ) . the radial velocity distribution for the m86 gcs is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig - vphist ] ; the distribution appears to be gaussian .",
    "the @xmath51 statistics @xcite gave an @xmath51 value of 1.022 , which is smaller than the critical value for rejecting the gaussian hypothesis at the 90% confidence level , @xmath52 .",
    "this suggests that the velocity distribution of the m86 gcs follows a gaussian distribution . a gaussian fit yields a peak at @xmath53 km",
    "s@xmath1  with a width of @xmath54 km s@xmath1 . the bottom panel of figure [ fig - vphist ] shows the radial velocities as a function of the projected galactocentric radius @xmath17 .",
    "mean velocities of the gcs in the inner ( @xmath55 ) and outer ( @xmath56 ) regions are similar to that of the gcs in the entire region .",
    "the velocity difference between the gc samples and the m86 nucleus is more visible in this panel .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the m86 gcs determined with the biweight scale of @xcite is @xmath3 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gcs in the inner region , @xmath57 km s@xmath1 , is similar to that in the outer region ,",
    "@xmath58 km s@xmath1 .",
    "it is noted that the velocity dispersion determined in this study could be contaminated by the inclusion of possible mw stars because the systemic velocity of m86 , @xmath59 km s@xmath1 , is in the velocity range of the mw stars .",
    "the plot of the radial velocities as a function of the @xmath10 colors , @xmath14 magnitudes , and position angles @xmath60  ( measured from the north to east ) in figure [ fig - vpt1ct1radpa ] shows that the mean values of the radial velocities do not change with either the magnitude or the color .",
    "however , the mean values of the radial velocities seem to depend on the position angle , showing a minimum value at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests a rotation of the m86 gc system ( discussed in detail in the next section ) .      in figure [ fig - radec ]",
    ", we show the spatial distribution of the m86 gcs with measured velocities .",
    "although the spatial coverage is neither uniform nor large , the spatial segregation of the high- and low - velocity gcs relative to the velocity of the m86 nucleus can be seen , which indicates a rotation of the gc system ( see also figure [ fig - vpt1ct1radpa ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the amplitude and axis of rotation for the m86 gc system was measured with the following assumptions : ( a ) the gc system is spherically symmetric , and ( b ) the rotation axis of the gc system lies in the plane of the sky .",
    "if the gcs follow any overall rotation , the radial velocities will depend sinusoidally on the azimuthal angles .",
    "thus , we can then determine the amplitude and axis of rotation by fitting the radial velocities ( @xmath63 ) to the function @xcite ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the rotation amplitude and @xmath66 is the systemic velocity of the gc system .",
    "figure [ fig - thetavp ] plots the radial velocities of the gcs as a function of position angle and an overlay of the best fit rotation curve .",
    "we use an error - weighted , nonlinear fit of equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) with @xmath66 fixed to the value of the m86 nucleus velocity .",
    "this gives a rotation amplitude of @xmath65 @xmath67 km s@xmath1 , which suggests a rotation of the m86 gc system .",
    "however , as this result is based on a small sample size , it will need to be examined again with a larger number of gcs in future studies .",
    "the orientation of the rotation axis ( @xmath68 ) is estimated to be @xmath69 , and this appears to be closer to the photometric major axis of m86 ( @xmath70 ) than to the minor axis .",
    "the rotation of the m86 gc system around the major axis is consistent with the result based on stellar kinematics , although the spatial coverage for the stellar kinematics was much smaller than this study @xcite .",
    "we summarize the kinematic results of the m86 gc system in table [ tab - m86kin ] : the range of galactocentric radius of the gcs in arcsec , mean value of the radial distance in arcsec , number of gcs , mean projected velocity and velocity dispersion about the mean velocity ( @xmath71 ) , position angle of the rotation axis and rotation amplitude estimated using equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) , velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve ( @xmath72 ) , and absolute value of the ratio of the rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve .",
    "the uncertainties of the values represent @xmath73 @xmath74 confidence intervals that were determined from the numerical bootstrap procedure following the method of @xcite .      here",
    ", we investigate the existence of an extended dark matter halo in m86 by a comparison of the observed velocity dispersion profile ( vdp ) of the gcs and the vdp expected from the stellar mass profile @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass profile is derived from the surface brightness profile of m86 , which is then used to compute the vdp .",
    "assuming that the m86 gc system is spherically symmetric in the absence of rotation , we apply the spherical jeans equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) to a dynamical analysis of the gc system .",
    "the spherical jeans equation is    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the three - dimensional radial distance from the galactic center , @xmath77 is the three - dimensional density profile of the gc system , @xmath78 is the radial component of velocity dispersion , @xmath79 is the velocity anisotropy , @xmath80 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath81 is the total gravitating mass contained within a sphere of radius @xmath76 .",

    "if we fix @xmath86 as a constant and assume @xmath84 , we can predict the profile of @xmath78 . a comparison of this with the observed vdp , will provide information about the existence of a dark matter halo . because the observed vdp for the gcs is projected",

    "we also assume @xmath17-band mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath106 ) and velocity anisotropies of the stellar halo ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "for comparison , the predicted vdps for the m86 gcs derived with the same stellar mass profile , the gc number density profiles ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) determined in the previous section , and several velocity anisotropies ( @xmath1140.99 ( radially biased ) , 0.0 ( isotropic ) , and 99 ( tangentially biased ) ) are also shown .",
    "the vdps based on the nfw and dehnen density profiles are not significantly different from each other .",
    "note that none of the models agree with the observed vdps of the gcs at @xmath115 kpc , which suggests that the mass - to - light ratio is not constant over the galactocentric radius but should increase with radius .",
    "this clearly suggests the existence of an extended dark matter halo in the outer region of m86 .",
    "we determined the metallicities and ages of the m86 gcs using two methods : ( 1 ) the bh method , which determines the metallicity through an empirical relation between absorption line index and metallicity developed by @xcite , and ( 2 ) the grid method , which derives the metallicity and age from a comparison of the lick line index of the spectrum with that of a single stellar population ( ssp ) model .",

    "the offsets we derived are @xmath124 for h@xmath26 , @xmath125 for mgb , @xmath126 for fe5270 , and @xmath127 for fe5335 ( see table 1 in @xcite for the offsets of other indices ) .",
    "we determined the lick line indices for eight gcs in m86 , which are listed with errors in table [ tab - lickindexerr ] .",
    "the composite index [ mgfe]@xmath128 , defined by [ mgfe]@xmath128  @xmath129 , is a good metallicity tracer because of its low sensitivity to [ @xmath130/fe ] .",
    "the index h@xmath26  is an age indicator and the least sensitive to [ @xmath130/fe ]  among the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "thus , we determine the metallicity and age of each gc in the h@xmath26  versus [ mgfe]@xmath128  grids provided by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - samplegrid ] shows the observational indices of the m86 gcs in comparison with the ssp model grids for h@xmath26  versus [ mgfe]@xmath128 , which indicate ssp models with [ @xmath130/fe ]  = 0.2 , [ z / h ] = 2.25 , 1.35 , 0.33 , 0.0 , 0.35 , and 0.67 dex , and ages of 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , and 15 gyr .",
    "all gcs seem to have ages larger than @xmath225 gyr and metallicities smaller than the solar abundance . for the gcs inside the envelope of the model grid , we take the [ z / h ] value and age at the nearest model grid interpolated with bins of 0.01 dex for [ z / h ] and 0.1 gyr for age . for the gcs outside the envelope , we take the values of the nearest envelope of the model grid in the direction of the error vector as done in @xcite .",
    "the two outliers with large difference from the model envelope along the h@xmath26  axis might be due to a limit of the low resolution integrated spectroscopy or of the model grids because these objects are also often shown in studies of mw gcs and m31 gcs derived from high s / n spectra @xcite as well as other ge gcs @xcite . to estimate the errors in the age and metallicity",
    ", we calculate the ages and metallicities of four data points composed of h@xmath26  @xmath131 error and [ mgfe]@xmath128  @xmath131 error in the grid .",
    "the difference between the average of these four values and the estimate calculated directly from the @xmath132 is taken as the final error .",
    "the metallicities of eight gcs derived from the grid method are compared with those from the bh method in figure [ fig - compbhgrid ] ( a ) .",
    "the two measurements are broadly consistent within the uncertainty . here , the total metallicity ( [ z / h ] ) derived from the grid method was converted into [ fe / h](grid ) using the relation @xmath122}=\\textrm{[z / h]}-0.94 $ ] [ @xmath130/fe ]   @xcite . for this conversion",
    ", we adopted [ @xmath130/fe ]  = 0.2 , which is the mean [ @xmath130/fe ]  for the gcs in ges @xcite .",
    "we also compared the observational @xmath133 colors of the m86 gcs @xcite with the model colors derived from the [ z / h ] and age using the ssp model in @xcite . among the eight gcs ,",
    "five gcs agree well within their errors as shown in figure [ fig - compbhgrid ] ( b ) .",
    "the metallicities and ages of the m86 gcs are listed in table [ tab - m86gc ] , and figure [ fig - agemetal ] shows ( a ) [ fe / h ] versus @xmath17 , ( b ) age versus @xmath17 , ( c ) [ fe / h ] distribution , and ( d ) age distribution of the m86 gcs .",
    "it is not easy to derive any systematic trend in the data because of small number statistics .",
    "however , several features are noted .",
    "first , the metallicities of the 16 gcs based on the bh method show a wide range of @xmath134 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 with a mean value of @xmath6 , which is similar to that based on the the grid method ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "second , metal - rich gcs ( [ fe / h ] @xmath136 ) are found only in the inner region ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "third , the age of the m86 gcs also shows a wide range from 4 to 15 gyr with a mean of 9.7 @xmath131 4.0 gyr .",
    "this is similar to the gcs in other ges ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig - gesagemetal ] shows the metallicity as a function of age for the m86 gcs .",
    "this figure shows a hint for an age - metallicity relation , meaning that the younger gcs are more metal - rich .",
    "this relationship in ges has also been seen for the gcs in m60 @xcite and in ngc 5128 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite did not strongly conclude its existence due to the large biases in their selected gc sample ( e.g. , extremely bright clusters ) .",
    "a more complete analysis with a more comprehensive data set of ge gcs is necessary to draw a strong conclusion about the age - metallicity relation .",
    "using the subaru spectroscopic data of m86 gcs , we studied the kinematic and chemical properties of the m86 gc system .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    1 .   for the first time , we measured the radial velocities of 31 objects in the m86 field : 25 m86 gcs , two foreground stars , one probable intracluster gc in the virgo cluster , two faint galaxies , and the m86 nucleus .",
    "the mean velocity of the gcs is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which is different from the velocity of the m86 nucleus ( @xmath2 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gcs is @xmath3 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the m86 gc system shows a hint of rotation .",
    "3 .   from a comparison of",
    "the vdps predicted from the stellar mass profile with the observed vdps of the stars and gcs , we found evidence for the existence of an extended dark matter halo in m86 .",
    "4 .   we determined the metallicities for 16 gcs using the bh method , and the ages and metallicities for 8 gcs using the grid method .",
    "the metallicity of the m86 gcs derived from the bh method is in the range @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 with a mean value of @xmath6 .",
    "the grid method results in similar [ fe / h ] values and a mean age of 9.7 @xmath131 4.0 gyr .",
