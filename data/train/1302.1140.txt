    "since its invention@xcite atomic force microscopy ( afm ) has developed into one of the most versatile techniques in surface science . at length scales ranging from micrometers down to the level of single atoms ,",
    "afm - based techniques are used to image@xcite , measure@xcite and manipulate mater@xcite at an interface . as an imaging tool",
    ", the goal of afm development has been increasing spatial resolution and minimizing the back action force from the probe on the sample surface .",
    "a major advancement in this regard was the development of dynamic afm@xcite in which a sharp tip at the free end of the afm cantilever oscillates close to the sample surface as depicted in figure [ fig : exp - setup ] . in order to achieve stable oscillatory motion , an external drive force",
    "is applied to the cantilever which is usually purely sinusoidal in time with a frequency that is close to the resonance frequency of the first flexural eigenmode of the cantilever .",
    "the high quality factor of the resonance ensures that the responding motion of the tip is approximately sinusoidal in time , with the same frequency as the drive signal@xcite .",
    "such periodic motion is best analyzed in the frequency or fourier domain , where the motion is well described by one complex - valued fourier coefficient at the drive frequency .",
    "this motion has a corresponding fourier coefficient of the tip - surface force , which can be expressed in terms of two real - valued components , @xmath1 which is in - phase with the motion and @xmath2 which is quadrature to the motion . at a fixed probe height @xmath3 above the surface ,",
    "the two force quadratures @xmath1 and @xmath2 give only qualitative insight into the interaction between the tip and the surface@xcite and most quantitative force reconstruction methods are based on a measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at different @xmath3 @xcite .    in order to increase the accessible information",
    "while imaging with afm , a variety methods have been put forward where amplitude and phase at more than one frequency is analyzed .",
    "these multifrequency methods can be divided in to two general groups : those using only fourier components with frequencies close to a cantilever resonance , and those which use off - resonance components .",
    "off - resonance techniques typically measure higher harmonics of the tip motion which allows for a reconstruction of time - dependent surface forces acting on the tip . due to the lack of transfer gain off resonance , these off - resonance components have small signal - to - noise ratio and",
    "their measurement requires special cantilevers@xcite , high interaction forces@xcite or highly damped environments@xcite . to increase the number of fourier components with good signal - to - noise ratio , on - resonance techniques utilize multiple eigenmodes of the cantilever@xcite",
    "however , accurate calibration of higher cantilever modes remains complicated since additional knowledge about the cantilever is required .",
    "both on and off - resonance techniques require broad - band detection of the cantilever motion , which implies a sacrifice in the sensitivity and gain of the motion detection system .    to mitigate these problems ,",
    "we have developed narrow - band intermodulation afm ( imafm ) which analyzes the response only near the first flexural eigenmode . in general imafm",
    "utilizes frequency mixing due to the nonlinear tip - surface interaction .",
    "a drive signal that comprises multiple frequency components is used for exciting the cantilever , which will exhibit response not only at the drive frequencies , but also at frequencies that are linear integer combinations of the drive frequencies , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the drive frequencies .",
    "these new frequency components are called intermodulation products ( imps ) and one usually defines an order for each imp which is given by @xmath7 . if all frequencies in a signal are integer multiples of a base frequency @xmath8 the signal is called a frequency comb .",
    "the nonlinear tip - surface interaction maps a drive frequency comb to a response frequency comb , both having the same base frequency @xmath9 .",
    "different drive frequency combs can be used to place many response frequency components close to a resonance of the cantilever where they can be detected with good signal - to - noise ratio . in general the drive and response frequency combs",
    "could encompass more than one eigenmode of the cantilever . for a drive signal consisting of only two frequencies symmetrically placed around the first flexural resonance frequency as illustrated in figure [ fig : exp - setup ]",
    "the response is concentrated in the narrow band around the first resonance for which well accurate calibration methods exist@xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will focus on this particular case which we call narrow - band imafm .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that drive schemes which generate response in more than one frequency band are also possible .",
    "we have previously shown how the individual amplitudes@xcite and phases@xcite of the imps in the narrow band around the first flexural resonance can be used for imaging .",
    "furthermore , a polynomial reconstruction of the tip - surface force@xcite and a numerical fit of the parameters of a force model@xcite are possible by analysis of the data in the frequency domain . here",
    ", we consider the meaning of the narrow - band intermodulation response comb in the time domain , which leads to a physical interpretation of the intermodulation spectrum in terms of the in - phase force component @xmath1 and the quadrature force component @xmath2 .    .",
    "the spectrum of the drive comb consist of two frequency components spaced by @xmath9 and centered at the first flexural resonance frequency @xmath10 of the cantilever which is much higher than the comb base frequency @xmath9 ( here @xmath11 ) .",
    "the driven tip oscillates with amplitude @xmath12 and interacts with the sample surface .",
    "the instantaneous tip position @xmath13 is measured in the rest frame of the sample surface .",
    "the corresponding deflection signal is detected by an optical lever system and is concentrated to a narrow band around @xmath10 , as the drive signal . in this band",
    "new frequency components spaced by @xmath9 are present which are generated by the nonlinear tip - sample interaction @xmath14 . outside the narrow band at @xmath10",
    "there is only little response in bands at integer multiples of @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : exp - setup ] ]",
    "figure [ fig : downshift - sketch](a ) portrays the amplitudes of the components of a narrow band frequency comb .",
    "while we are plotting only the amplitude at each component , it is understood that each component also has a phase .",
    "the frequency comb is characterized by the center frequency @xmath15 of the comb , a base frequency @xmath9 and a finite number @xmath16 of fourier components at discrete frequencies . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath16 to be even .",
    "the center frequency @xmath15 can be described in terms of the ratio @xmath17 and the bandwidth of the comb is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath16 discrete frequencies in the band are represented by an integer frequency index @xmath19 such that @xmath20 where @xmath19 takes consecutive integer values between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the time domain",
    "the corresponding real - valued signal @xmath23 is then given by the fourier series @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the complex fourier components in the narrow frequency band and the star denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the center frequency @xmath15 is usually much bigger than the base frequency @xmath9 , @xmath26 therefore , the time domain signal @xmath23 exhibits two different time scales : a fast time scale @xmath27 and a slow time scale @xmath28 .",
    "to separate these two time scales we factor out a rapidly oscillating term at the frequency @xmath15 from the fourier series in equation ( [ eq : signal - fourier - series ] ) , @xmath29 since @xmath16 is even , @xmath30 is an odd integer number and we can define a new sum index @xmath31 which increase in steps of @xmath32 and the summation limits become @xmath33 since @xmath16 is even and @xmath34 increases only in steps of two , @xmath34 can only take odd values .",
    "additionally , we define new fourier coefficients @xmath35 such that the signal fourier series becomes @xmath36 we identify the terms in parentheses as the fourier series of a complex - valued time - dependent envelope function @xmath37 expanded in the base frequency @xmath38 , @xmath39 and write the original signal @xmath23 as @xmath40 the envelope function @xmath37 was obtained by down - shifting the narrow intermodulation frequency band to a center frequency of zero ( see figure [ fig : downshift - sketch ] ) .",
    "if the maximum frequency in the fourier series of @xmath37 is much smaller than @xmath15 , the envelope function @xmath37 varies slowly compared to the term @xmath41 in equation ( [ eq : signal - with - cx - envelope ] ) .",
    "when we represent @xmath37 by a time - dependent amplitude @xmath42 and a time - dependent phase @xmath43 such that @xmath44 the signal @xmath23 is completely described by a modulated oscillation amplitude and a modulated oscillation phase , @xmath45     in a bandwidth that is given by the integer number @xmath46 . the spectrum of the corresponding time - dependent envelope function(b )",
    "is obtained by down - shifting the original spectrum in frequency space such that the shifted center frequency is zero .",
    "[ fig : downshift - sketch ] ]    we would like to emphasize that the narrow - band frequency comb can also describe amplitude and frequency modulated signals . for frequency modulation we define an instantaneous oscillation phase @xmath47 and an instantaneous oscillation frequency @xmath48 the instantaneous frequency shift @xmath49 compared to @xmath15 is then simply @xmath50 in a small region around the time @xmath51 the signal @xmath23 can be obtained by a taylor expansion to first order of the instantaneous phase @xmath52 @xmath53 thus , a narrow - band frequency comb can describe signals with frequency shifts that are periodic in time .    to illustrate",
    "the complete description of a narrow - band signal by its envelope function , figure [ fig : envelope - example ] shows the spectrum of an artificially constructed signal with sinusoidally modulated amplitude and frequency .",
    "typical parameters from afm experiments have been chosen for the amplitude and frequency modulation .",
    "the spectrum of the signal shown in figure [ fig : envelope - example ] shows significant amplitudes at discrete frequencies in only a narrow band around 300 khz . we down - shift the spectrum to determine the slowly varying envelope function",
    "from which we compute the time - dependent oscillation amplitude and frequency , both of which are in excellent agreement with the actual amplitudes and frequencies used for the signal generation .    ]    to summarize , we have introduced a time domain interpretation of narrow - band frequency combs . if the center frequency of the band is much higher than the base frequency of the comb , we can separate a fast and a slow time scale in the time domain . on the fast time",
    "scale the signal rapidly oscillates at the center frequency .",
    "the slow time scale dynamics is given by the down - shifted intermodulation spectrum which describes a slow amplitude modulation and a slow phase or frequency modulation of the signal in the time domain .",
    "in imafm the measured frequency comb corresponds to a vertical motion @xmath54 of the tip which undergoes rapid oscillations at frequency @xmath15 with slowly varying amplitude and phase , @xmath55 where @xmath3 is the static probe height above the surface and the amplitude @xmath42 and the phase @xmath43 are determined from the complex - valued motion envelope function @xmath56 as @xmath57 the envelope function @xmath56 was obtained directly from the measured motion spectrum using equation ( [ eq : envelope - function ] ) .",
    "the tip motion shows an amplitude modulation . on the fast time scale",
    "@xmath58 the signal rapidly oscillates . during each oscillation cycle",
    "the tip interacts with the surface for the time @xmath59 during which the oscillation amplitude phase are approximately constant.[fig.sketch - motion - decomposition ] ]    knowledge of the cantilever transfer function @xmath60 and the applied drive force allows for converting the measured motion spectrum into the spectrum of the time - dependent tip - surface force acting on the tip .",
    "however , the force spectrum is incomplete since higher frequency components of the force are filtered out from the motion spectrum by the sharply peaked cantilever transfer function .",
    "the time - dependence of the corresponding partial force signal is described by the force envelope function @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath61 is determined by applying equation ( [ eq : envelope - function ] ) to the partial force spectrum .",
    "to understand the physical meaning of the partial force we analyze the signals at the level of single rapid oscillation cycles in the time domain . during each oscillation cycle",
    "the tip interacts with the sample surface .",
    "this interaction is very localized ( a few nanometers above the surface ) compared to the oscillation amplitude ( tens of nanometers ) and thus the interaction time @xmath59 is short compared to the fast oscillation period @xmath58 which itself is much shorter than the period of the beat @xmath63 ( see figure [ fig.sketch-motion-decomposition ] ) , @xmath64 therefore , amplitude @xmath42 , phase @xmath43 and force envelope function @xmath61 can be considered to be constant during each interaction cycle and the motion and the partial force during the @xmath65-th tip oscillation cycle are given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constant and are determined at the time @xmath70 of the ith lower turning point of the tip motion @xmath71 the complete time - dependent tip - surface force during an interaction cycle is a force pulse which can be written as a fourier series in the oscillation frequency @xmath15 as @xmath72 where the complex fourier components @xmath73 fulfill the relation @xmath74 .",
    "comparison of equation ( [ eq : partial - force - fourier ] ) with equation ( [ eq : complete - force - fourier ] ) yields @xmath75 which reveals that the first fourier component @xmath76 of the force pulse during the ith oscillation cycle is given by the force envelope function @xmath77 determined from the partial force spectrum . since each lower motion turning point is associated with a unique amplitude @xmath67 we can consider @xmath78 as a function of the continuous variable @xmath12 , @xmath79 the amplitude - dependence of @xmath80",
    "can then be uncovered by the analysis of all oscillation cycles during the time @xmath63 .",
    "to better relate motion and the force we compute the components of @xmath81 that are in phase with the motion ( @xmath1 ) and quadrature to the motion ( @xmath2 ) . for a tip - surface force that only depends on the instantaneous tip position and velocity , @xmath82 we approximate the tip motion to be purely sinusoidal at frequency @xmath15 with amplitude @xmath12 and without an additional phase . at fixed probe height @xmath3 ,",
    "the components @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by two integral equations @xmath83 with these assumptions @xmath1 becomes the so - called virial of the tip - surface force which is only affected by the conservative part of the tip - surface interaction@xcite whereas @xmath2 is related to the energy dissipated by the tip - surface interaction@xcite .",
    "we note that through their dependence on tip position @xmath13 and velocity @xmath84 , the force components @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of both probe height @xmath3 and oscillation amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "however , usually they are considered as functions of the probe height @xmath3 only .    for an imafm measurement at fixed probe height",
    ", the amplitude - dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can readily be obtained by defining a new force envelope function that is phase - shifted with respect to the motion by the angle @xmath85 , @xmath86 which we evaluate as real and imaginary parts at the times of the lower turning points of the motion @xmath87 with this interpretation of an intermodulation spectrum we are able to reconstruct the amplitude - dependence of the force quadratures @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are independent of details of the tip motion on the slow time scale . due to this independence ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the input quantities for nearly all force spectroscopy methods in dynamic afm and thereby they form the basis of quantitative dynamic afm .      to demonstrate the accuracy of the @xmath1(a ) and @xmath88 reconstruction from imafm data we simulate the tip motion in a model force field .",
    "we excite the tip with two frequencies close to the first flexural resonance frequency of @xmath89 which allows us to model the cantilever as a single eigenmode system for which the tip dynamics are described by an effective harmonic oscillator equation@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the quality factor of the resonance , @xmath92 is the mode stiffness and @xmath93 is the static probe height above the surface .",
    "the drive strengths @xmath94 and @xmath95 at the frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 are chosen such that in the absence of a tip - surface force , the tip oscillation amplitude is sinusoidally modulated between 0 nm and 30 nm .",
    "for the tip - surface force @xmath14 we assume a van - der - waals - derjaguin - muller - toporov ( vdw - dmt ) force with additional exponential damping as which is defined as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the hamaker constant , @xmath100 is the tip radius , @xmath101 is the damping constant , @xmath102 is the damping decay length and @xmath103 is the effective stiffness . for the numerical integration of equation ( [ eq : equation - of - motion ] ) we use the adaptive step - size integrator cvode@xcite with root detection to properly treat the piecewise definition of the tip - surface force in equation ( [ eq : tip - surface - force ] ) . from the simulated tip motion",
    "we determine the motion and the force envelope functions @xmath104 and @xmath77 and reconstruct @xmath1(a ) and @xmath88 according to equations ( [ eq : fi - ef ] ) and ( [ eq : fq - ef ] ) . as shown in figure ( [ fig : f - sim - recon ] ) the reconstructed curves are in excellent agreement with the curves directly computed with equations ( [ eq : fi - int ] ) and ( [ eq : fq - int ] ) from the model force used in the simulations .     and @xmath88 curves reconstructed from simulated tip motion in imafm .",
    "the reconstructed curves are in good agreement with the actual curves directly determined from the model force used in the simulations.[fig : f - sim - recon ] ]      the force quadratures @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the basic input quantities for a variety of force reconstruction techniques@xcite . over the last decade the dominate paradigm was to consider @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of the static probe height _ @xmath3 _ only , and only one oscillation amplitude @xmath12 was considered at each probe height .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are however functions of both @xmath3 and @xmath12 as seen in the two - dimensional color maps shown in figure [ fig : f - model - maps ] for the vdw - dmt force with exponential damping used in the previous section . in order to emphasize the interaction region near the point of contact ,",
    "data in the @xmath3-@xmath12 plane with @xmath105 are masked with white .    in both frequency modulation afm ( fm - afm ) and",
    "amplitude modulation afm ( am - afm ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 are usually probed by a slow variation of the probe height @xmath3 with fixed oscillation amplitude at each height . to measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 in fm - afm the oscillation frequency shift and the drive force",
    "are recorded as the static probe height is slowly varied ( frequency - shift - distance curves ) .",
    "active feedback is used to adjust both the drive power and drive frequency , as to keep the response amplitude and phase constant .",
    "the obtained frequency shifts and drive forces can then be converted into the force quadratures@xcite so that the measurement corresponds to a measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 along a path parallel to the @xmath3-axis in the @xmath3-@xmath12-plane ( see figure [ fig : f - model - maps ] ) .    in am - afm",
    "the oscillation amplitude and phase with respect to the drive force are measured as a function of the static probe height @xmath3 ( amplitude - phase - distance curves ) and are then converted into values of the force quadratures@xcite .",
    "in contrast to fm - afm , the oscillation amplitude is free to change during the measurement and thus the am - afm measurement path in the @xmath3-@xmath12-plane is more complicated .",
    "the path shown in figure [ fig : f - model - maps ] was obtained by simulating the am - afm tip dynamics with cvode . in the simulations we used the same cantilever and force parameters as in the previous section with a drive signal at only one frequency of @xmath106 . as is often the case with am - afm",
    ", the amplitude - phase - distance curve exhibits an abrupt amplitude jump due to the existence of multiple oscillation states@xcite .",
    "this instability is frequently observed in experiments , and it makes the reconstruction of tip - surface forces rather difficult .",
    "in contrast to fm - afm and am - afm , imafm allows for a measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at fixed static probe height , along a straight path parallel to the @xmath12-axis in the @xmath3-@xmath12 plane as shown in figure [ fig : f - model - maps ] for the simulation of the previous section .",
    "each of these three measurement techniques probes the tip - surface interaction along a different path in the @xmath3-@xmath12 plane . with imafm",
    "however , the measurement can be rapidly preformed in each point of an image , while scanning with normal speed @xcite allowing for unprecedented ability to analyse the tip - surface force while imaging .",
    "the imafm spectral data , which is concentrated to a narrow band near resonance , is a complete representation of the measurable tip motion , because there is only noise outside this narrow frequency band .",
    "thus the method optimally extracts the signal for compact storage and further analysis .",
    "we note that the imafm path provides an equivalent amount of information as frequency - shift - distance or amplitude - phase - distance curves .",
    "this implies that for a single scan imafm image information equivalent to a frequency - shift - distance curve or an amplitude - phase - distance curve is available in every image point .",
    "moreover , the imafm measurement does not suffer from amplitude jumps since the stiffness of the cantilever resonance prevents big amplitude changes from one single oscillation cycle to the next single oscillation in the beat tip motion .     and",
    "@xmath107 maps for the vdw - dmt force with exponential damping introduced in equation ( [ eq : tip - surface - force ] ) .",
    "the displayed measurement paths correspond to a frequency - shift - distance curve in fm - afm , an amplitude - phase - distance curve in am - afm and an imafm measurement .",
    "in contrast to fm - afm and am - afm , the static probe height is constant during an imafm measurement and the @xmath3-@xmath12 plane is explored along a path parallel to the @xmath12 axis .",
    "one should also note the amplitude jump along the am - afm path at a probe height of @xmath108.[fig : f - model - maps ] ]      it is possible to acquire maps of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the full @xmath3-@xmath12 plane with a protocol we call imafm approach measurements .",
    "similar to the measurement of frequency - shift or amplitude - phase - curves , the static probe height above the surface is varied by slowly extending the z - piezo toward the surface .",
    "however , in contrast to fm - afm and am - afm measurements , the oscillation amplitude is rapidly modulated as the probe slowly approaches the surface .",
    "because the height variation is much slower ( order of seconds ) than the amplitude modulation ( order of milliseconds ) , the probe height can be considered to be constant during each amplitude modulation . in this case",
    "each amplitude modulation reveals the amplitude dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at a constant probe height . from the different probe heights @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be reconstructed can be reconstructed in the full @xmath3-@xmath12 plane . with fm - afm or am - afm such",
    "a measurement would require much longer measurement time since multiple surface approaches with different amplitudes would be required . with imafm all",
    "the data is acquired during a single surface approach .",
    "we use imafm approach curves to reconstruct @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps on a polystyrene ( ps ) polymer surface .",
    "we perform a slow surface approach and from the acquired data we reconstruct the @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps shown in figure [ fig : f - maps - exp ] . on the @xmath3-axis",
    "we show the piezo extension since the absolute probe height can not be defined unambiguously in an experiment .",
    "the areas in the @xmath3-@xmath12 plane that were not explored are displayed as white areas .     and",
    "@xmath107 maps reconstructed from an imafm approach measurements on a ps surface .",
    "the z - piezo extension corresponds to a relative change of the probe height @xmath3 above the sample surface .",
    "[ fig : f - maps - exp ] ]    the boundary to the white area in the upper part of the plots represents the maximum oscillation achievable for the fixed drive power .",
    "the boundary to the white area in the lower part of the plot corresponds to the minimum oscillation amplitude during one modulation period ( one beat ) .",
    "this lower boundary shows interesting variations with the piezo extension .",
    "further away from the surface at larger piezo extension , only positive values of @xmath1 are achieved , which corresponds to the tip oscillating in a region where the net conservative force is purely attractive . as the surface",
    "is further approached , @xmath1 also takes on negative values , when the net force becomes repulsive . at probe heights between 7 and 13",
    "nm the strongest repulsive force is experienced . around @xmath10913 nm and below ,",
    "the attractive region vanishes , which may be the result of a change in the cantilever dynamics due to relatively long interaction time , or a change in the hydrodynamic damping forces due to the surrounding air close the sample surface .",
    "one should also note that at this piezo extension the minimum oscillation amplitude begins to increase again .",
    "a possible artifact of the measurement method may result in this low amplitude region , if the motion spectrum is no longer confined to a narrow frequency band , as assumed in the analysis .",
    "the map of @xmath2 characterizes the dissipative interaction between tip and sample",
    ". the dissipative tip - surface force can be much more complex than the conservative part of the interaction since dissipative forces do not only depend on the instantaneous tip position as with the conservative force .",
    "the @xmath2 map can provide detailed insight into the nature of the dissipative interaction since the full dependence of @xmath2 on probe height @xmath3 and oscillation amplitude @xmath12 is measured .",
    "the @xmath2 map shows a lower level of force than the @xmath1 map and it therefore appears more noisy , because the tip - surface interaction is predominately conservative .",
    "the small positive values of @xmath2 which occur far from the surface would imply that the tip gained energy from the interaction with the surface .",
    "this may be an artifact , but another possible explanation is some sort of hydrodynamic mode above the surface@xcite . in both the attractive and repulsive region of the in - phase force @xmath1 ,",
    "the quadrature force @xmath2 is predominantly negative and it decreases as the surface is indented , corresponding to a increasingly dissipative tip - surface interaction .",
    "however , the maximum dissipation does not coincide with the maximum repulsive conservative force , and the energy dissipation is largest at peak amplitude for piezo extensions between 2 and 6 nm",
    ". another interesting feature of the @xmath1 map is the fine structure in the contact region , between @xmath109 10 and 20 nm piezo extension .",
    "these small step - like changes of conservative force are not present in the smooth force model function , and could be indication that the dissipative forces are resulting in small , irreversible modifications of the sample surface .",
    "we presented a physical interpretation of tip motion when described by a narrow - band frequency comb in imafm .",
    "we showed by separation of time scales that the time domain signal of a narrow - band frequency comb is completely characterized by a complex - valued envelope function and a rapidly oscillating term .",
    "the application of this time domain picture to imafm allows for the reconstruction of two force quadratures @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of the oscillation amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be considered as two - dimensional functions , depending on the both probe height and the oscillation amplitude . within this framework",
    "we find a connection between frequency - shift - distance curves in fm - afm , amplitude - phase - distance - curves in am - afm , and imafm measurements .",

    "we demonstrated the reconstruction of @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps experimentally on a ps polymer surface .",
    "we hope that the physical interpretation of narrow - band dynamic afm presented here , will inspire new force spectroscopy methods in the future which take advantage of the high signal - to - noise ratio and the high acquisition speed of imafm .",
