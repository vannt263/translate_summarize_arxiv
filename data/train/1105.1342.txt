    "the distributions in both figures exhibit similar shapes and minima at the axes @xmath223 , and are very different from those obtained if only the recollision - excitation prefactor is included ( see fig .",
    "[ homo0deg](f ) ) .",
    "the main effect of the excitation prefactor @xmath224 is to alter the widths of the distributions .",
    "this situation persists for larger angles , such as @xmath225 and @xmath226 as a comparison of figs .",
    "[ li2homolumoall].(b ) and ( c ) , with fig .",
    "[ lumo4590deg].(c ) and ( f ) shows . for @xmath201 , there is a suppression of the yield near the axes @xmath195 , while for @xmath204 the interference patterns are washed out .",
    "another interesting feature is that the overall yield decreases with the alignment angle between the molecular axis and the field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lumo , from which the second electron tunnels , is a @xmath102 orbital .",
    "spatially , @xmath102 orbitals are localized along the internuclear axis , and do not exhibit nodal planes for vanishing alignment angle .",
    "this implies that tunneling ionization is favored when the lumo is parallel to the laser field , and decreases when the difference between the orientation between the field and the lumo increases .",
    "a legitimate question is , however , how the shape of the molecular orbital to which the second electron is excited is imprinted on the electron momentum distribution , if there are nodal planes parallel or perpendicular to the molecular axis .",
    "for that reason , we now present electron momentum distributions under the assumption that the second electron is excited to a @xmath227 orbital .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath0 and its singly ionized counterpart , i.e. , @xmath228 as the molecular species in our resi computation .",
    "the first electron will be ripped off from the homo , which is a @xmath229 orbital . however , upon return , it will excite the second electron to the lumo , which is a @xmath230 orbital .",
    "a @xmath230 orbital exhibits two nodal planes , which will be oriented along the laser - field polarization for parallel and perpendicular - aligned molecules , i.e. , at alignment angles @xmath231 and @xmath204 .",
    "this orbital also exhibits lobes at angles @xmath232 with regard to the internuclear axis .",
    "the results obtained for this molecular species are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ n2homolumo ] . as an overall pattern , we observe that the nsdi signal no longer decreases monotonically with increasing alignment angle .",
    "in fact , the signal increases for alignment angle @xmath233 , is strongest for @xmath201 , and decreases once more for @xmath234 .",
    "this may be easily understood as a consequence of the geometry of the @xmath230 orbital . for @xmath231 ( fig .",
    "[ n2homolumo](a ) ) , the external field is parallel to one of the nodal planes .",
    "hence , tunnel ionization is strongly suppressed .",
    "this reflects itself in the overall yield .",
    "as the alignment angle increases , the field - polarization direction gets further and further away from the direction of this nodal plane , and the yield increases until @xmath201 ( fig .",
    "[ n2homolumo](b ) ) . for this angle ,",
    "the field is parallel to one of the lobes of the @xmath230 orbital , so that tunnel ionization of the second electron is enhanced . as the alignment angle",
    "is further increased , the direction of the field approaches the nodal plane at @xmath235 and ionization is further suppressed ( fig .",
    "[ n2homolumo](c ) ) .",
    "apart from the above - mentioned behavior , we also observe a suppression along the axes @xmath195 , regardless of the alignment angle .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in position space , @xmath112 orbitals vanish at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "consequently , their fourier transform vanish for @xmath195 .",
    "( bound - state energies @xmath236 a.u . , @xmath237 a.u . , and @xmath238 a.u . and equilibrium internuclear distance @xmath239 a.u . ) in a linearly polarized monochromatic field of intensity @xmath240 as functions of the parallel momenta @xmath221 considering all prefactors , for alignment angles @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 degrees(panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively).,width=604 ]",
    "the results presented in the previous sections illustrate the potential of laser - induced nonsequential double ionization for the attosecond imaging of molecules .",
    "this is particularly true if the recollision - excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization ( resi ) pathway is dominant . the computations in this work show that the shapes of the resi electron momentum distributions depend in a dramatic fashion on the geometry of the state to which the second electron has been excited by the first electron , and from which it tunnels .",
    "the state in which the second electron is initially bound , i.e. , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the singly ionized species plays only a secondary role .",
    "thereby , two main issues are important in determining the shapes of the electron momentum distribution : the quantum interference caused by the interference due to the photoelectron emission at spatially separated center , and the geometry of the orbital from which the second electron tunnels .    in order to investigate the first issue , generalized interference conditions for the first and second electron that take into account @xmath2 @xmath3 mixing along the lines of @xcite",
    "have been derived , and led to fringes parallel to the @xmath195 @xmath6 axes in the plane spanned by the electron momentum components parallel to the laser - field polarization .",
    "these fringes agreed well with analytic estimates , but were washed out for relatively small alignment angles .",
    "in contrast , the features caused by the orbital geometry , such as suppression of the probability density near @xmath195 observed for @xmath3 states were present over a wide range of alignment angles .",
    "furthermore , the presence or absence of nodal planes manifests itself as the suppression , or enhancement , of the overall yield with regard to the alignment angle .",
    "we have discussed the differences and similarities between @xmath244 and @xmath227 orbitals in this context , exemplified by the lumos of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these results agree with those reported in the literature for phenomena such as high - order harmonic generation @xcite and above - threshold ionization @xcite .",

    "<S> we address the influence of the molecular orbital geometry and of the molecular alignment with respect to the laser - field polarization on laser - induced nonsequential double ionization of diatomic molecules for different molecular species , namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the recollision excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization ( resi ) mechanism , in which the first electron , upon return , promotes the second electron to an excited state , from where it subsequently tunnels . we show that the electron - momentum distributions exhibit interference maxima and minima due to the electron emission at spatially separated centers . we provide generalized analytical expressions for such maxima or minima , which take into account @xmath2 @xmath3 mixing and the orbital geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns caused by the two - center interference are sharpest for vanishing alignment angle and get washed out as this parameter increases . apart from that , there exist features due to the geometry of the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , which may be observed for a wide range of alignment angles . </S>",
    "<S> such features manifest themselves as the suppression of probability density in specific momentum regions due to the shape of the lumo wavefunction , or as an overall decrease in the resi yield due to the presence of nodal planes .      </S>",
    "<S> strong - field phenomena such as high harmonic generation ( hhg ) or above - threshold ionization ( ati ) have been used as tools for the attosecond imaging of molecular orbitals @xcite , for probing the structural changes in molecules with attosecond precision and for studying quantum interference effects due do photoelectron or high - harmonic emission at spatially separated centers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been made possible due to the fact that both phenomena are caused by the rescattering or recombination of an electron with its parent molecule , which , for typical intense lasers , occur within hundreds of attoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest targets for which this interference can be studied are diatomic molecules , which can be viewed as the microscopic counterpart of a double - slit experiment doubleslit .    </S>",
    "<S> potentially , laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) can also be employed for probing molecular orbitals since laser - induced recollision plays an important role in this case . in ndsi </S>",
    "<S> the returning electron rescatters inelastically with its parent ion , or molecule , giving part of its kinetic energy to a second electron . </S>",
    "<S> this electron can be released in the continuum either through electron - impact ionization a.becker,carla1,carla2,m.lein,x.liu,prauzner,a.staudte,emanouil,bondar or recollision excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization ( resi ) resi1,resi2 . </S>",
    "<S> the former recollision mechanism happens when the first electron , upon return , gives enough energy to the second electron of the target so that it can overcome the second ionization potential and reach the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the latter recollision mechanism happens when the first electron , upon return , gives just enough energy to the second electron so that it can be promoted to an excited bound state , from where it subsequently tunnels .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> , nsdi exhibits several advantages , with regard to ati or hhg . </S>",
    "<S> first , it allows one to extract more dynamic information about the system , as the type of electron - electron interaction can be identified in the electron - momentum distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , different rescattering mechanisms , such as electron - impact ionization or resi , populate different regions in momentum space and hence can also be traced back from such distributions @xcite . apart from that , events happening at different half cycles of the driving field can be mapped into different momentum regions . </S>",
    "<S> concrete examples are nsdi with few - cycle pulses @xcite , which lead to asymmetric electron - momentum distributions , and individual processes in nsdi of diatomic molecules f2009 . finally , electron - electron correlation is at the essence of this phenomenon and can not be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for high - order harmonic generation one may , to first approximation , only consider a single active electron and the highest occupied molecular orbital . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , only very recently have multiple orbitals and electron - electron correlation been incorporated in the modeling of molecular high - order harmonic generation @xcite .    for the above - mentioned reasons , nsdi of molecules </S>",
    "<S> is being increasingly investigated since the past few years . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there has been experimental evidence that the orbital symmetry @xcite and the alignment angle @xcite affect the shapes of the electron momentum distributions . since then </S>",
    "<S> , many theoretical studies have also been performed for molecules , involving , for instance , classical trajectory methods @xcite , the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation in reduced - dimensionality models @xcite , and semi - analytical approaches based on the strong - field approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> semi - analytical models for nsdi in molecules , however , focus on the electron - impact ionization rescattering mechanism .    for instance , in our previous paper @xcite we addressed the influence of the orbital symmetry and the molecular alignment with respect to the laser - field polarization on nsdi of diatomic molecules for the electron - impact ionization mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the electron momentum distribution exhibit interference maxima and minima due to electron emission at spatially separated centers . </S>",
    "<S> such fringes were positioned at @xmath4 , i.e. , parallel to the anti diagonal of the plane spanned by the electron momentum components @xmath5 @xmath6 parallel to the laser - field polarization . </S>",
    "<S> they were sharpest if the molecule was aligned along the direction of the field , i.e. , for vanishing alignment angle . </S>",
    "<S> as this angle increased , the fringes got increasingly blurred until they were completely washed out for perpendicular alignment .    apart from that , </S>",
    "<S> recently , several studies have found that the core dynamics , in particular excitation , is important for high - harmonic generation in molecules @xcite , and in particular for attosecond imaging of matter . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this also to be the case for nonsequential double ionization . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason , in the past few years , we have focused on the resi mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the shape of the electron momentum distributions depends very strongly on the initial and excited bound states of the second electron @xcite , in fact far more critically than for electron - impact ionization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case already for single atoms , one expects this dependence to be even more critical for molecules .    for resi , we expect the electron momentum distributions to be affected very strongly by the geometry of the bound - state wavefunctions , not only because the excitation process strongly depends on them , but also due to the fact that the second electron is reaching the continuum by tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> it is by now well known that this ionization mechanism is strongly influenced by the presence of nodal planes or the directionality of a particular molecular orbital . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for hhg the nodal plane of a @xmath7 state suppresses tunnel ionization when it coincides with the polarization axis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present paper , we perform a systematic analysis of quantum - interference effect in nsdi of diatomic molecules considering the resi mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a semi - analytical model , based on the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) , in which an electron tunnels from the homo of a neutral molecule and rescatters with the homo of its singly ionized counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , we assume that the second electron is excited to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of such orbitals and of the alignment angle on the nsdi electron momentum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we choose species for which these orbitals have different geometries and parities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we address the question of whether well - defined interference patterns such as those observed in ati or hhg computations may also be obtained for nsdi in the context of the resi mechanism , and , if so , under which conditions . </S>",
    "<S> these are complementary studies to those performed in our recent work on resi @xcite , where we show that , for single atoms , the shapes of the electron momentum distributions carry information about the bound state from which the second electron leaves and the state to which it is excited .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ transampl ] we discuss the expression for the resi transition amplitude , including its general expression  ( sec .  [ generalexpr ] ) , the saddle - point equations obtained from it ( sec .  [ saddle ] ) and the specific prefactors for a diatomic molecule using gaussian orbital basis sets ( sec .
