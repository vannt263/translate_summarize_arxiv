    "radiative corrections in the standard model of electroweak interactions ( @xmath5 ) have taken a very prominent position in today s description of experimental results .",
    "perhaps the most compelling reason for this state of affairs is that the experimental results have reached a level of precision which require a comparison with theory beyond the born calculations , which the @xmath5 is able to provide .",
    "if loop calculations are needed for the calculation of physics observables , the measurements show sensitivity to the masses and couplings of the particles propagating in the loops .",
    "the experimental measurements can thus provide information about the particles contributing to the radiative corrections well below the threshold for directly producing them . in this summary",
    "the most recent electroweak results from @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders will be described .",
    "the emphasis will be on electroweak results from data taken on the @xmath6 resonance . within the @xmath5 ,",
    "the description of all processes involving neutral currents is given in terms of the chiral couplings of the fermion @xmath7 to the @xmath6 boson , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , or more commonly in terms of the vector and axial - vector couplings , @xmath10 and @xmath10 : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the weak mixing angle , @xmath13 the weak isospin component of fermion @xmath7 and @xmath14 its charge .",
    "because the left - handed and right - handed coupling of fermions to the @xmath6 boson are not the same , the angular distribution of the outgoing fermion with respect to the incoming fermion in the center of mass frame for the process @xmath15 has a term linear in @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the distribution is thus asymmetric and will exhibit a forward - backward asymmetry , defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cross section for fermion production in the forward hemisphere ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 the cross section for the backward hemisphere ( @xmath21 ) .    around the @xmath6 pole ,",
    "the photon exchange and @xmath22 interference are only small corrections to the resonance cross section . retaining only the resonance cross section , the forward - backward asymmetry on the pole is , at lowest order , given by @xmath23 where the asymmetry of couplings , @xmath24 , are given by @xmath25 these expressions will be modified when including higher order corrections .",
    "weak vertex corrections and self - energy diagrams will introduce fermion dependent form factors which can be absorbed in the definition of the coupling constants  @xcite . by introducing effective coupling constants the born structure of the processes can to a good approximation",
    "be retained . since all asymmetry measurements determine essentially the ratio of couplings @xmath26 it is convenient to define an effective electroweak mixing angle @xmath27 which is well matched with the quantities measured experimentally .",
    "the effective electroweak mixing angle is , coincidentally , very close to the definition in the @xmath28 scheme  @xcite .",
    "the results presented are based on event samples of about @xmath29 leptonic and @xmath30 hadronic @xmath6 decays per lep experiment , complemented with @xmath31 @xmath6 decays recorded at slc with a polarized electron beam .",
    "the experiments cdf and 0 each have approximately 60,000 leptonic @xmath32 and 6000 leptonic @xmath6 decays collected during the 1992 - 1993 run ( run  1a ) and the 1994 - 1995 run ( run  1b ) combined .",
    "a fivefold increase in luminosity was obtained in the latter run .",
    "all results presented are preliminary .    in the next section results from line shape measurements",
    "will be described .",
    "the results on the effective coupling constants from the line shape measurements and the forward - backward asymmetries in the leptonic sector will be summarized in section  [ sec : avg ] .",
    "the section following describes the main developments in the hadronic sector with the emphasis on @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "given the full set of measurements , an overall fit is performed within the framework of the @xmath5 and the consistency of the results verified .",
    "we will conclude with some recent developments .",
    "in and @xmath0 collisions final state lepton pairs are produced through photon and @xmath6 exchange .",
    "the cross section at lowest order is given by @xmath35 consisting of the @xmath6 resonance cross section , the qed annihilation term ( @xmath36 ) and the @xmath22 interference term ( @xmath22 ) . at proton colliders the resonance cross section for @xmath32 and @xmath6 production",
    "is used to indirectly determine the width of the @xmath32 boson through the ratio of the @xmath32 and @xmath6 production cross sections . at @xmath0",
    "colliders the measurement of the resonance line shape is used to extract @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : l3_xsec ] shows the hadronic resonant cross section as measured by the l3 experiment . from the hadronic decays of the @xmath6 boson the hadronic pole cross section , @xmath39 is determined . from the leptonic",
    "decays the ratio of the partial hadronic and leptonic widths , @xmath40 , is derived .",
    "this particular choice of variables , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , is motivated by the desire to minimize the correlation among the variables and to minimize any model dependence .",
    "one of the main challenges of these measurements is to control the systematic uncertainties and keep them at the same level as the statistical uncertainties .",
    "since the measurements of these quantities entail both an absolute cross section measurement and an absolute mass determination , the luminosity and energy calibration are crucial .",
    "the lep experiments all measure the luminosity with small angle silicon based calorimeters with good spatial resolution counting bhabha events . at small scattering angles",
    "@xmath43 , the cross section for bhabha scattering shows a @xmath44 dependence . for the luminosity measurement a very precise knowledge of the edges of the acceptance",
    "is required .",
    "an accuracy of 10  @xmath45 m is currently achieved , resulting in an uncertainty of @xmath46% , surpassing the theoretical uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in the calculation of the bhabha cross section  @xcite have significantly reduced the theoretical uncertainty on the luminosity to the level of  0.11% , with a further reduction of a factor of two anticipated in the near future .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the calibration of the lep beam energy is a remarkable feat .",
    "the beam energy is measured most accurately using the technique of resonant depolarization which has an ultimate accuracy of about 200  kev .",
    "this calibration , however , can not be performed very often since it takes a long time for the transverse beam polarization to build up in the accelerator .",
    "moreover , it can not be done during a physics run and has been performed with separated beams only .",
    "the energy of the beam is generally tracked using nmr probes .",
    "over the course of the years it was discovered that the circumference of the lep tunnel , and thus the beam energy , was sensitive to the water level of lake geneva and the phases of the moon .",
    "the sun and moon tides changed the lep orbit by up to 1  mm  @xcite . in 1995",
    "nmr probes were installed inside two of the lep magnets in the tunnel and a new puzzle arose .",
    "it was observed that there were large fluctuations in the beam energy which magically disappeared at midnight only to show up again shortly after 4 am each day .",
    "this effect was eventually traced to an induction voltage on the lep beam pipe caused by vagabond currents on the tgv train track rails ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tgv ] )  @xcite .",
    "all these effects have been taken into account for the results presented here and propagated back into the previous years with a resulting uncertainty on the @xmath6 mass and width of @xmath47 = 1.5  mev / c@xmath48 and @xmath49 = 1.7  mev .",

    "the contributions from the @xmath51 channel diagrams by themselves violate unitarity .",
    "the measurements of the pair production cross section are therefore a beautiful demonstration of the gauge cancellations in the @xmath5 , as demonstrated already with the study of @xmath32 pairs produced at the @xmath1 colliders  @xcite .",
    "the direct production of @xmath32 bosons now also allows for a direct measurement of its magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moment at lep , two quantities on which stringent limits already exist from the @xmath1 experiments  @xcite .",
    "it has been unprecedented that an anticipated quark was discovered with a mass exactly within the range predicted from loop corrections within a theoretical framework .",
    "this is a remarkable feat for experimentalists and theorists alike and attests to the enormous success of the @xmath5 .",
    "even though many measurements are now being carried out with excruciating precision , the @xmath5 shows no signs of giving up its claim of being the description of the fundamental interactions as we know them .",
    "the large deviations that existed in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 measurements have greatly diminished .",
    "the @xmath5 , though , is incomplete .",
    "given its inherent shortcomings one gets the feeling , looking back at for example fig .  [",
    "fig : gll_seff ] and table  [ tab : summary ] , that in some sense the agreement with the @xmath5 predictions is too good . with the new data from lep  2 , sld and the tevatron , and with the planned upgrades of the accelerators as well as the experiments , the projected uncertainties  @xcite on some fundamental parameters",
    "should provide the tools to take another ever more critical look at the @xmath5 , without any theoretical prejudice .",
