    "@xcite have recently shown that the acoustic oscillations before recombination give rise to streaming velocities between the dark matter ( dm ) and gas . whereas the pressure of the photon - baryon fluid suppressed the growth of baryonic perturbations prior to recombination , the dm aquired streaming velocities of order @xmath4 at @xmath5 for typical @xmath6 fluctuations . during recombination , the sound speed of the gas dropped from roughly @xmath7 to @xmath8 as it transformed from a radiation - dominated plasma to a largely neutral gas . as a result",
    ", the relative streaming velocities between dark matter and gas transitioned from a subsonic into a supersonic regime , with typical mach numbers @xmath9 . after this period ,",
    "the gas remained thermally coupled to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through compton scattering with residual free electrons , so that the sound speed decayed as @xmath10 until @xmath11 . disregarding sourcing , the streaming velocities therefore decayed at most as @xmath12 , so that the mach number dropped to @xmath13 once the gas became fully adiabatic , and remained constant thereafter .    streaming velocities of this magnitude",
    "may alter the abundance of dm halos of mass @xmath14 and lead to an increased bias and clustering on scales between a few and @xmath15 , roughly corresponding to the silk damping length and the sound horizon at recombination @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the 21 cm signal before and during reionization could also be modified substantially .",
    "@xcite exploited the coherence of streaming velocities below scales of about @xmath16 to investigate their influence on the formation of the smallest bound objects .",
    "they found that the abundance of dm halos with virial masses @xmath17 was reduced by a few percent , while the gas fractions of these halos were affected by a somewhat larger amount .",
    "@xcite used smaller box sizes and concentrated on the collapse of gas in minihalos , finding almost no increase in the virial mass and only a mild delay of collapse .    in the present study we also focus on minihalos , where the effect is likely",
    "to be most pronounced .",
    "compared to previous investigations , we employ a higher resolution , which allows us to investigate the influence of streaming velocities in more detail , but limits the number of realizations that we can investigate .",
    "furthermore , we here employ the moving mesh code arepo , which is based on a set of grid points that are advected with the flow @xcite .",
    "this allows a higher efficiency and accuracy compared to sph simulations , while maintaining the natural adaptivity of sph .",
    "compared to amr simulations , the galiliean - invariance of arepo is advantageous when dealing with supersonic bulk velocities .",
    "the structure of our work is as follows : in section  2 , we present the numerical setup of the simulations , followed by our main results ( section  3 ) and a brief discussion of their implications ( section  4 ) .",
    "all distances quoted in this paper are in proper units , unless noted otherwise .     at @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the thick dashed line denotes the cosmological baryon fraction .",

    "is typically increased by a factor of @xmath20 , which delays pop  iii star formation by @xmath3.,width=302 ]    .",
    "the different colors distinguish the individual realizations , while the solid and dashed lines denote cases with no streaming velocity and a @xmath6 streaming velocity of @xmath21 at @xmath18 , respectively .",

    ", the increased virial mass leads to a higher virial temperature .",
    "this difference is reduced at smaller radii ( higher densities ) , since the gas cools very efficiently during runaway collapse .",

    "the factor of @xmath20 increase in minimum virial mass leads to a reduction of the number of star - forming minihalos by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the influence of pop  iii stars on observables such as the @xmath22 background or the reionization of the universe might therefore be substantially reduced.,width=302 ]",
    "we perform three statistically independent simulations in boxes with a side length of @xmath23 , denoted mh1 to mh3 . for each realization of the cosmological density field ,",
    "we first run a coarse dm simulation to identify the lagrangian region of the first minihalo that exceeds a virial mass of @xmath24 . in these simulations",
    ", we employ @xmath25 particles of mass @xmath26 and use a comoving gravitational softening length of @xmath27 .",
    "the initial fluctuation power spectrum is that of a @xmath28 cold dark matter ( @xmath28cdm ) cosmology at a starting redshift of @xmath18 , with matter density @xmath29 , baryon density @xmath30 , hubble parameter @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the present hubble expansion rate ) , and a spectral index of @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters are based on the five - year wmap results @xcite .",
    "the three realizations use different linearly extrapolated present - day normalizations @xmath34 , which we set to @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to altering the redshift of collapse , and allows us to extend the scope of our simulations in light of the limited box sizes employed .",
    "once the location of a minihalo in each realization has been identified , we use the refinement procedure described in @xcite to increase the mass resolution within a sufficiently large region around the target halo .",
    "the final masses of the dm particles and the mesh - generating points that represent the gas particles are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the comoving gravitational softening length of the refined dm component is @xmath40 .",
    "we displace the gas particles relative to the dm particles by half the mean interparticle separation , implicitly assuming that the transfer functions of the gas and dm components are equivalent .",
    "this can substantially affect the filtering mass scale @xcite , but we chose to neglect this caveat since we here investigate the differences between simulations with and without streaming velocities , but otherwise identical parameters .    in simulations mh1rel to mh3rel",
    ", the gas particles obtain an additional velocity of @xmath41 in the @xmath42-direction , which approximately corresponds to a @xmath6 peak .",
    "the high resolution region is extended in the @xmath42-direction to ensure that only refined particles collapse into the minihalos .",
    "simulations without an additional streaming velocity are denoted mh1norel to mh3norel .",
    "the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas is captured with a primordial chemistry network that tracks the abundances and the cooling from h , h@xmath43 , h@xmath44 , h@xmath45 , h@xmath46 , he , he@xmath43 , he@xmath47 , d , d@xmath43 , hd , and free electrons @xcite .",
    "we account for all relevant cooling processes , including h@xmath46 and hd rotational and vibrational line cooling , h@xmath46 collision - induced emission ( cie ) cooling , h@xmath46 collisional dissociation cooling , and heating due to three - body h@xmath46 formation . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to first order , streaming velocities may be considered as an additional source of pressure , which increases the jeans mass of the gas : @xmath48 with @xmath49 . according to this simple argument , the minimum halo mass required for collapse",
    "is increased .",
    "@xcite showed that this picture qualitatively describes their simulation results .",
    "the effect is particularly important in minihalos , since a @xmath6 streaming velocity of @xmath1 at @xmath50 is comparable to the sound speed of virialized gas in halos with @xmath51  a lower limit for pop  iii star formation @xcite .    in figure  1",
    ", we show the temperature of the gas once the central hydrogen density first exceeds @xmath52 .",
    "we define this as the collapse redshift , since at this point in time the central gas cloud has evolved well beyond the initial jeans instability and the density increases exponentially . in cases with a streaming velocity ,",
    "the minihalos are more massive at the point of collapse , implying a higher virial temperature .",
    "the motions accompanying their virialization also appear to be more complex .",
    "for example , the virial shocks in the direction of the incoming streaming flows are more pronounced than on the opposite side .",
    "this effect is particularly evident in simulation mh1 , where a filament was by chance aligned perpendicular to the streaming velocity .    in figure  2",
    ", we show the gas fractions and maximum densities of the three minihalos as a function of time . in cases with an imposed streaming velocity",
    ", the gas fractions are reduced by about @xmath19 .",
    "this agrees well with the analytical predictions of @xcite . at a given point in time , the maximum density of the halo is reduced , so that the halo does not cool until it has accreted enough mass to compensate for this effect .",
    "the resulting shifts in virial mass and redshift are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the virial masses increase from @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 to @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively , corresponding to factors of @xmath59 , @xmath53 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the redshifts of collapse are shifted from @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , resulting in delays of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we note that the factor of @xmath20 increase in virial mass is particularly important since it non - linearly affects the number density of dm halos that can cool and form pop  iii stars ( see section  3.3 ) .",
    "the increased momentum and energy input by streaming velocities also affects the thermal and turbulent evolution of the gas . in figure  4",
    ", we compare the temperature and velocity dispersion within all three minihalos . in cases with a streaming velocity , the gas temperature near",
    "the virial radius is systematically higher .",
    "this is not suprising , since the virial temperature scales with virial mass and redshift as @xmath70 a factor of @xmath20 increase in the virial mass and a comparatively small decrease in redshift therefore result in a factor of @xmath71 higher virial temperature .",
    "once the gas begins to cool efficiently , this difference is quickly reduced , however , and we find no clear difference remaining below @xmath72 .    in the bottom panel of figure  4 , we also show the velocity dispersion of the gas in radial bins after subtracting the bulk velocity of the halo and a spherically averaged radial infall and rotation velocity .",
    "unlike the temperature , the velocity dispersion remains systematically higher by a factor of a few even at very high densities .",
    "evidently , the gas becomes more turbulent in the presence of streaming velocities .",
    "this could affect the mass function of the first stars , since a higher ratio of the velocity dispersion to the sound speed usually results in increased fragmentation at later stages in the collapse @xcite . as a result , the typical mass of a pop  iii star may be reduced .",
    "how common is the above delay considering the minihalo population as a whole ?",
    "since each component of the large - scale streaming velocity is distributed according to a gaussian , the magnitude of the velocity vector obeys a maxwell distribution @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the dispersion of each individual velocity component .",
    "the fraction of the universe with streaming velocities greater than @xmath75 at @xmath18 , which we consider a lower limit for the above delay to be significant , may be found by integrating the above function from @xmath76 to infinity , which yields approximately @xmath77 .",
    "this shows that our results may be considered representative for most of the volume .",
    "the cosmological number density of minihalos hosting pop  iii stars may then be estimated using the sheth - tormen @xcite mass function : @xmath78 where we set @xmath79 for the case of no streaming velocities and @xmath80 for the case of a universal @xmath6 streaming velocity , representing the factor of @xmath20 increase in minimum halo mass .",
    "the resulting number densities should be considered upper limits , since not every halo at the low - mass end forms a pop  iii star .",
    "we set @xmath81 , but note that our results are not sensititive to this parameter , since massive halos are rare . as shown in figure  5 , the number of minihalos that cool and form stars is reduced by up to an order of magnitude in the presence of streaming velocities .",
    "such a large effect implies that streaming velocities should be taken into account when the influence of the first stars on observables is investigated .",
    "we have found that supersonic streaming velocities between the dm and gas substantially delay the onset of gravitational collapse in minihalos . the virial mass required for efficient cooling",
    "is increased by a factor of @xmath20 , which results in an average delay of pop  iii star formation by @xmath67 . streaming velocities",
    "also enhance the build - up of turbulence during runaway collapse , which could affect the fragmentation of the gas and hence the mass function of the first stars .",
    "our results agree well with the simulations presented in @xcite concerning the delay of collapse .",
    "in addition , and in contrast to their result , we find a significant increase in the minimum halo mass required for the gas to cool .",
    "this might be due to the @xmath82 times higher resolution employed in the present study , ensuring that the dm softening length is comparable to the size of the jeans - unstable gas cloud .",
    "if this criterion is not fulfilled , the collapse of the gas might be artificially delayed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have investigated this for the case mh1 .",
    "we increased the initial dm and gas particle masses by factors of @xmath83 and @xmath84 to @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the dm and @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the gas . in these simulations",
    "we also decreased the number of cells enforced per jeans length from @xmath89 to @xmath84 and @xmath90 ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "when decreasing the resolution , the virial mass of the minihalo at the point of collapse is increased from @xmath53 to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the redshift of collapse is shifted from @xmath61 to @xmath93 and @xmath94 . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase of the initial resolution by a factor of eight results only in a marginal decrease of the virial mass to @xmath95 , and shifts the redshift of collapse to @xmath96 .",
    "this shows that insufficient resolution can artificially delay the collapse of the halo , which might be one of the reasons why @xcite find significantly higher halo masses .",
    "due to the large shift in mass in the presence of streaming velocities , the number density of minihalos expected to form pop  iii stars is reduced by up to an order of magnitude , and is further modulated with a spatial coherence length corresponding to many mpc in the present universe .",
    "this could leave a distinct imprint on the 21 cm background and the reionization of the universe @xcite , as well as affect the observability of pop  iii supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ultimately , this modulation might be inherited by the distribution of more massive objects forming at later times , thereby biasing large - scale structure estimates of cosmological parameters such as those related to the properties of dark energy ."
