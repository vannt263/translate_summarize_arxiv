    "the noise driven escape from a deterministically metastable state is a theme that impacts many phenomena in diverse fields of natural sciences @xcite . in particular , as a notable model for a chemical reaction kramers  @xcite pioneered the problem of an escape of a brownian particle of mass @xmath3 moving in a potential @xmath4 with local minima corresponding to an initial reactant and a final product state . in this scenario ,",
    "both states are assumed to be separated by a barrier located at a position @xmath5 . in the spatial - diffusion - limited regime ,",
    "the kramers rate theory is based on a stochastic dynamics that does not involve inertial effects and thus is described by an overdamped langevin dynamics , reading    @xmath6    here , @xmath7 constitutes a white gaussian noise process with correlations @xmath8 , representing thermal fluctuations whose intensity is scaled by the friction @xmath9 .",
    "the escape problem then concerns the surmounting of an energetic barrier for stochastic trajectories that predominantly dwell the neighborhood of separating attractors which in this case are made of two neighboring potential wells .",
    "the imposed quasi - stationarity condition is realized by assuming special boundary conditions with respect to the time evolution equation for the probability density . in the overdamped regime ,",
    "the evolution equation for the probability density @xmath10 follows the smoluchowski dynamics @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the stationarity approximation describes escape events which correspond to a constant , non - vanishing flux of probability @xmath13 .",
    "those stochastic realizations of the process that have surpassed the barrier top are immediately absorbed and re - inserted into the original attractor region . in this way a steady probability flow across the activated barrier state located between the locally stable states of `` reactants '' and `` products '' is established .",
    "escaped trajectories , absorbed at a position larger than the barrier location @xmath14 require that @xmath15 on the whole half - line @xmath16 .",
    "the rate formulation is then based on the `` flux over the population '' method  @xcite , yielding in this case of a smoluchowski dynamics the celebrated result @xcite :    @xmath17 , \\label{rate}\\ ] ]    with @xmath18 denoting the activation energy @xmath19 and @xmath20 representing the frequencies of the particle s motion near the metastable potential minimum @xmath21 and at the top of the crossed barrier , respectively .",
    "this result represents a feasible estimate for the actual reaction rate , if all trajectories ejected by the source properly thermalize before eventual thermal fluctuations drive them out of the initial well and , most importantly , a distinct time - scale separation between escape dynamics and intra - well relaxation holds true .",
    "this latter requirement of a clear - cut time - scale separation is at the basis for the description of the escape dynamics in terms of a ( time - independent ) rate coefficient @xcite .",
    "yet another alternative to the approaches discussed above is rooted in the concept of the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) , i.e. the average time that a random walker starting out from a point @xmath22 inside the initial domain of attraction , assumes in order to leave the attracting domain for the first time @xcite .",
    "put differently , the mfpt is the average time needed to cross the deterministic separatrix - manifold for the first time @xcite . at",
    "weak noise the mfpt becomes essentially independent of the starting point , i.e. @xmath23 for all starting configurations away from the immediate neighborhood of the separatrix .",
    "given the fact that the crossing of the separatrix in either direction equals for _ normal diffusion _ one half , the total escape time @xmath24 equals @xmath25 and thus the rate of escape @xmath26 itself becomes in this case : @xmath27    characterization of the escape rate by use of the mfpt is a rather complex notion for a general class of stochastic processes . in particular ,",
    "the mfpt analysis requires the choice of a correct boundary condition @xcite .",
    "these are well known for one - dimensional stochastic diffusion markov processes @xmath28 which are of the fokker - planck form , eqs .",
    "( [ smol0][smol ] ) or for one dimensional master equations with birth and death kinetics . with",
    "generally non - gaussian white noise the knowledge of the boundary location alone typically can not specify in full the corresponding boundary conditions for , say , absorption or reflection , respectively @xcite .",
    "in particular , the trajectories driven by non - gaussian white noise depict discontinuous jumps . as a consequence",
    ", the location of the boundary itself is not hit by the majority of discontinuous sample trajectories .",
    "this implies that regimes beyond the location of the boundaries must be properly accounted for when setting up the boundary conditions .",
    "most importantly , returns ( i.e. so termed re - crossings of the boundary location ) from excursions beyond the specified state space back into this very finite interval where the process proceeds must be excluded .",
    "following our reasoning in discussing lvy - brownian motion on finite intervals @xcite , we present in this paper the analysis of escape events of a non - inertial , generalized diffusion process which is driven by lvy noise dwelling a symmetric double - well potential . +",
    "the standard definition of the gaussian white noise specifies the latter as a time derivative of the wiener process ( i.e. a derivative of a stationary process with independent and gaussian - distributed increments whose covariance is given by @xmath29 ) .",
    "a classical brownian motion ( the wiener process ) can be therefore represented as a limit in distribution of independent gaussian jumps taken at infinitesimally short time intervals of non - random length @xmath30 .",
    "alternatively ( following e.g. definition of feller @xcite ) , the wiener process can be thought of as a limiting process of random gaussian jumps at random poissonian jump times :    @xmath31}_{k=1}w_k\\left ( \\frac{1}{n } \\right )   = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}w\\left ( \\frac{n(nt)}{n}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\sum^{n(tn)}_{k=1}w_k , \\label{wiener}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the symbol @xmath32 $ ] stands for an integer number of jumps which for a poisson counting process @xmath33 with them mean @xmath34 are assumed to be independent ( decoupled ) of _ i.i.d _ random variables @xmath35 sampled from the gaussian distribution .",

    "such lvy noise is white , i.e. its autocorrelation function is formally a dirac - delta function of time .    for the sake of clarification",
    ", we mention here that there exist different representations of other lvy noises that are non - markovian in nature . as an example , so called fractional gaussian ( or lvy ) noise is sometimes defined in literature as the time derivative of a fractional brownian motion process @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the gaussian ( or our lvy ) white noise , the fractional gaussian noise ( fractional lvy stable motion ) may exhibit slowly decaying time - correlations .",
    "this is however not the case with the type of lvy noise addressed in our paper , where the noise source at the level of the langevin equation _ is a white noise process_.",

    "an asymmetry of the lvy noise perturbing the dynamics is shown to either enhance or also suppress the escape events and corroborates the intuitive influence of the @xmath0 parameter which yields an additional , biasing contribution to the particles motion due to the directionality of stochastic impact pulses .",
