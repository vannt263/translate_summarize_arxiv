    "frequency multiplexing combined with rf reflectometry of the sds was performed using two lc circuits matching a carrier wave of frequency 107.1 mhz for sd1 and 86.4 mhz for sd2 .",
    "the inductors are formed by microfabricated nbtin superconducting spiral inductors with an inductance of 3.2 @xmath24h ( sd1 ) and 4.6 @xmath24h ( sd2 ) .",
    "the power of the carrier wave arriving at the sample was estimated to be -93 dbm .",
    "the reflected signal was amplified using a cryogenic weinreb citlf2 amplifier and subsequently demodulated using homebuilt electronics .",
    "data acquisition was performed using a fpga ( de0-nano terasic ) and digital multimeters ( keithley ) .",
    "voltage pulses to the gates were applied using a tektronix awg5014 .",
    "the software was developed using python  @xcite with scipy  @xcite .",
    "the image processing is performed in pixel coordinates .",
    "we specify the parameters of algorithms in physical units such as mv .",
    "the corresponding parameter in pixel units is then determined by translating the value using the scan parameters . by specifying the parameters in physical units",
    "the algorithms remain valid if we make scans with a different resolution .",
    "of course making scans with a different resolution can lead to differences in rounding of numbers leading to slightly different results .",
    "* determine the lowvalue ( @xmath1 ) and highvalue ( @xmath25 ) of the scan by taking a robust minimum and maximum .",
    "for @xmath1 this is done by taking the 1^th^ percentile of the values .",
    "@xmath25 is determined by first taking the 90^th^ percentile of the scan data @xmath26 and then the 90^th^ percentile of all the values larger then ( @xmath27)/2 . this two - stage process to determine @xmath25 also works well when the pinch - off occurs for very positive gate voltages .",
    "simply taking for example the 99^th^ percentile of the scan data could then result in a too low estimate .",
    "* smoothen the signal and find the first element in the scan larger than @xmath28 .",
    "the position of that value is selected as the transition value .",
    "* perform several additional checks .",
    "the above two steps will always results in a transition value , even though the channel could be completely open or closed .",
    "the checks include amongst others : * * if the transition value is near the left border of the scan we conclude the transition has not been reached .",
    "we then set the transition value to the lowest value of the gate that has been scanned . in principle",
    "the algorithm could continue to search for a transition value for more negative gate voltages .",
    "however , making gate voltages too negative may induce charge noise in the sample so we do not want to apply very negative voltages . choosing the most negative voltage of the scan range then turns out to be a good choice . in the next steps of the algorithm , this transition voltage is just a starting value and the gate voltage will still be varied . due to cross - talk , the neighboring gates in follow - up steps will together with the gate that did not yet close , typically still ensure the formation of single dots . *",
    "* the difference of the mean of the measured values left of the transition value and the mean of the values right of the transition value should be large enough .",
    "large enough means more than 0.3 times the standard deviation of all the values in the scan .",
    "if it is not large enough , we set the transition value to the lowest value of the gate that has been scanned following a similar reasoning as for the previous check . in this scenario",
    "we assume that the scan range started at a voltage around 0  mv , and thus that no significant change in the measured current corresponds to a channel that was always open .",
    "as described in the main text the initial analysis of a 2d scan is performed by fitting a tetragon to the image .",
    "the bottom - left corner point of this tetragon gives a good indication of the position of the area where coulomb peaks are visible .",
    "see the magenta points in figs .",
    "[ fig : quadrilateral_fit](a - d ) .       the important structures in the scan of a double dot are the charging lines and the crossings of two charging lines . to determine the locations of the crossings in the image we create a template for such a crossing .",
    "we then search for crossings using template matching .",
    "the response to the template is thresholded and local maxima are calculated .",
    "the template of the crossing consists of 4 lines at angles @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( radians ) that are separated by a distance of 1.5  mv at 45 degrees that represents the interdot capacitive coupling ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] of the main text ) .",
    "the width of these lines ensures that experimentally measured crossings still overlap with the template despite unavoidable small variations in the interdot capacitive coupling and the lever arms between gate voltage and electrochemical potential , which affect the slope of the transitions .",
    "the final step consists of checking whether extra charging lines are visible in a region of @xmath870@xmath1770  mv@xmath18 to the side of more negative gate voltages .",
    "the size of this region should be larger than the charging energy of each dot in mv .",
    "the topright corner of the 70@xmath1770  mv@xmath18 area is located -10  mv southwest of the most bottom - left cross .",
    "we slightly extend this region on top and on the right to reduce the probability that a charging line is missed .",
    "if the total region falls outside the scan range of the data , the algorithm reduces the size of this region accordingly ( alternatively , one could take data over a larger gate voltage range ) .",
    "the algorithm could then draw the wrong conclusion .",
    "when the region that results from clipping at the border of the scan range is smaller than 40@xmath1740  mv@xmath18 , the algorithm will stop and output that it can not properly determine whether the single - electron regime has been attained . in the typical case",
    "that the region is large enough , we first smoothen the data within this region .",
    "we subtract the smoothed data from the original data and check whether the resulting pixel values fall above a certain threshold that is proportional to the standard deviation of the smoothed dataset .",

    "<S> we again monitor @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of these scans is always similar : for negative gate voltages the channel is closed , so there is no current . for more positive voltages the channel is open , so there is a large current . </S>",

    "<S> . they can then be used for non - invasive charge sensing which does allow one to distinguish single - electron transitions in the dot array through rf - reflectometry . to achieve a high sensitivity </S>",
    "<S> it is important that the sd is tuned to the flank of one of its coulomb peaks . after finding a coulomb peak for the sd in a similar way as described for the qubit dots , we make a 1d scan of the plunger gates , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : refinement](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> each detected coulomb peak is given a score based on its height and slope that allows the algorithm to continue with the most sensitive operating point for the corresponding plunger gate ( see supplementary information  [ section : coulumbtuning ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> + with the sd tuned we create a double dot in the following way : first we set the voltages of the gates for the double dot to the values found for the individual single dots ( black dots in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : refinement](b - e ) ) . for the single gate shared by the two individual dots ( e.g.  gate @xmath14 for the leftmost double dot ) the average of the two values is used . </S>",
    "<S> next , we record a charge stability diagram of the double dot structure by varying the two plunger gate voltages involved . </S>",
    "<S> we use a heuristic formula to determine the correct scan range that takes into account the capacitive coupling of the gates to the dots ( see supplementary information  [ sec : tuning_double_dot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> typical results for such scans are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a - c ) . </S>",
    "<S> scans involving two plungers are measured by applying a triangular voltage ramp to the plungers on the horizontal axis using an arbitrary waveform generator , and by stepping the other plunger gate using dacs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whilst stepping the latter gate we also adjust the sensing dot plunger gate to compensate for cross - capacitive coupling and thereby improve the operating range of the sd . </S>",
    "<S> + to verify that the double dot has reached the single - electron regime , the algorithm first detects how well specific parts of the charge stability diagrams match the shape of a reference cross ( see inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> each match should ideally correspond to the crossing of a charging line from each dot . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the reference cross is derived from the various capacitive couplings , which follow from the gate design and are known approximately from the start . instead of detecting crosses </S>",
    "<S> , one could also try to detect the individual charge - transition lines . </S>",
    "<S> this turned out to be more sensitive to errors for two reasons : ( 1 ) extra features in the charge stability diagrams that do not correspond to charging lines are wrongfully interpreted as dot features . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) not all charging lines are straight across the entire dataset ; this makes it harder to interpret which line belongs to which dot . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - matching algorithm is robust against such anomalies because of the local , instead of global , search across the dataset . in future work </S>",
    "<S> it could actually be useful to still detect these extra and/or curved lines . </S>",
    "<S> they could give information about e.g. unwanted additional dots and aid in determining the electron numbers in regions with higher tunnel couplings . </S>",
    "<S> for the current goal of finding the single - electron regime this extra information is not required . </S>",
    "<S> + next , the algorithm checks whether within a region slightly larger than 70@xmath1770  mv@xmath18 , it finds other charge transitions for more negative gate voltages with respect to the most bottom - left detected cross ( see supplementary information  [ sec : tuning_double_dot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these regions are depicted by the green tetragons in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] . if no extra transitions are detected : the single - electron regime has been found and the result is given a score of 1 for that specific measurement outcome . if extra transitions are found the algorithm outputs the score 0 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> this is where the algorithm stops . at the end of the run </S>",
    "<S> the user can see the measurement results for the various initial choices of @xmath0 and select the best one . </S>",
    "<S> + all combined , the running of this complete algorithm ( for a single value of the @xmath0-gate ) takes @xmath19  minutes . per device </S>",
    "<S> typically 5 @xmath0-values are tested . in practice </S>",
    "<S> we have observed that for some cooldowns of the sample the algorithm could not attain the single - electron regime . </S>",
    "<S> a thermal cycle combined with different bias cooling  @xcite can significantly influence the tuning and solve this issue ; just as for tuning done by hand . </S>",
    "<S> the key difference is that with the computer - aided tuning hardly any user effort is required to explore tuning of double dots to the few - electron regime . in future work </S>",
    "<S> the time required for automated tuning ( as well as for tuning by hand ) can be further reduced by also connecting the tunnel barrier gates of each single dot to a high - frequency line which would allow much faster scans for figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]-[fig : refinement ]  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these scans currently form the bottleneck in the overall tuning process . </S>",
    "<S> future experiments will also address the automated tuning of more than two dots and the tuning of the tunnel couplings in between dots and their reservoirs , which are key parameters for operating dots as qubit devices . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have demonstrated computer - automated tuning of double quantum dot devices into the single - electron regime . </S>",
