    "li - like and he - like oxygen are among the most important atomic species in uv and x - ray plasma diagnostics of astrophysical sources . for example , there is considerable current interest in o  vi and o  vii as a possible reservoir of ` missing baryons ' in the warm / hot intergalactic medium in the present universe ( cen 2001 , fang and canizares 2000 , yoshikawa 2003 ) .",
    "in addition to global ionization balance models that require o  vi / o  vii photoionization and recombination rates , specific spectroscopic diagnostics of both of these ions are related in an interesting but intricate manner .",
    "outflows observed from the ` warm absorber ' in active galactic nuclei exhibit absorption / emission lines in the x - ray from kll resonant photoabsorption in o  vi , and excitation / recombination of o  vii lines .",
    "this phenomenon was investigated theoretically by pradhan ( 2000 ) who pointed out that the observed spectra of the well known agn ngc 5548 shows these features ( kaastra 2000 ) .",
    "recently arav ( 2003 ) have further pursued this suggestion to infer large discrepancies in the uv and x - ray o  vi column densities in the outflow from ngc 5548 .",
    "ionization balance and spectral formation of o  vi and o  vii are crucial factors in all such studies .",
    "the inverse atomic processes of photoionization and electron - ion photorecombination of li - like and he - like ions are also of particular interest in x - ray astronomy to analyze new observations by space based observatories such as the chandra x - ray observatory and and xmm - newton , at photon energies and temperatures prevalent in high - temperature sources such as agb , supernova remnants , hot stellar coronae etc .",

    "calculations of the recombination - cascade contributions for these important lines requires accurate atomic parameters for fine structure levels up to fairly high  levels , as presented in this report .    in the present work we report new results for self - consistent data sets for photoionization and recombination for ( e + o v ) @xmath4 o vi and ( e + o vi ) @xmath4 o vii , using a unified theoretical method that takes account of both radiative and di - electronic recombination processes ( rr and dr ) .",
    "although treated separately in other previous treatments , both recombination processes , rr and dr , are inseparable in nature .",
    "a unified treatment is therefore not only theoretically and computationally more accurate , it is also more practically convenient for applications since a single recombination rate coefficent takes account of both rr and dr in an ab initio manner . for highly charged ions it is important to consider relativistic fine structure explicitly in the theoretical formulation , in addition to the electron correlation effects .",
    "previous results for o  vi ( nahar 1998 , 1999 ) were obtained in a non - relativistic ls coupling approximation ; relativistic effects were partially included for o  vii . to further improve the accuracy , as well as to provide extensive sets of data for astrophysical models",

    "extensive results from relativistic calculations for total and level - specific photoionization and recombination cross sections and rates are presented for o  vi and o  vii .",
    "these are of general interest in uv and x - ray spectroscopy of laboratory and astrophysical sources , especially the formation due to recombination of important lines such as the @xmath142 1032,1038 fine structure doublet in o  vi , and the ` triplet ' x - ray features in o  vii .    a discussion of some of the important atomic effects such as resolution and radiation damping of resonances , interference between non - resonant ( rr ) and resonant ( dr ) recombination , comparison with experimental data and uncertainties , and general features of the unified ( e  +  ion ) recombination rates , has also been given in the first paper on the new bprm calculations",

    "di - electronic satellite rates for the kll , klm , etc , complexes of several ions have earlier been shown to be in very good agreement with experiments and other theoretical calculations ( pradhan and zhang 1997 ; zhang 1999 ) , to about 10 - 20% ; it is therefore expected that the present rates should be definitive , with similar uncertainties .",
    "the present level - specific data can be used to construct recombination - cascade matrices for o  vi and o  vii , to obtain effective recombination rates into specific fine structure levels  ( slj ) with @xmath130 and @xmath143 ( e.g. pradhan 1985 ) .",
    "the present data is more than sufficient for extrapolation to high - n,@xmath144 necessary to account for all cascade contributions .",
    "the available data includes : ( a ) photoionization cross sections , both total and partial , for bound fine structure levels of o  vi and o  vii up to the @xmath82 levels .",
    "( b ) total unified recombination rates for o  vi and o vii , and level - specific recombination rate coefficients for levels up to @xmath82 .",
    "further calculations for other he - like and li - like ions are in progress .",
    "all photoionization and recombination data are available electronically at : nahar@astronomy.ohio-state.edu .",

    "<S> aimed at ionization balance and spectral analysis of uv and x - ray sources , we present self - consistent sets of photoionization cross sections , recombination cross sections , and rate coefficients for li - like o  vi and he - like o  vii . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic fine structure is considered through the breit - pauli r - matrix ( bprm ) method in the close coupling approximation , implementing the unified treatment for total electron - ion recombination subsuming both radiative and di - electronic recombination processes . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistency is ensured by using an identical wavefunction expansion for the inverse processes of photoionization and photo - recombination . </S>",
    "<S> radiation damping of resonances , important for h - like and he - like core ions , is included . </S>",
    "<S> compared to previous ls coupling results without radiative decay of low-  @xmath0 10 ) resonances , the presents results show significant reduction in o vi recombination rates at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the total rates , level - specific photoionization cross sections and recombination rates are presented for all fine structure levels  (  slj ) up to  @xmath1 , to enable accurate computation of recombination - cascade matrices and spectral formation of prominent uv and x - ray lines such as the 1032,1038  doublet of o  vi , and the ` triplet ' forbidden , intercombination , and resonance x - ray lines of o  vii at 22.1 , 21.8 , and 21.6  respectively . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , atomic parameters for 98 levels of o  vi and 116 fine structure levels of o  vii are theoretically computed . </S>",
    "<S> these data should provide a reasonably complete set of photoionization and recombination rates in collisional or radiative equilibrium . </S>"
