    "several diagnostic protocols are usually adopted by dermatologists for analyzing and classifying skin lesions , such as the so - called _ abcd - rule _ of dermoscopy @xcite . due to the subjective nature of examination ,",
    "the accuracy of diagnosis is highly dependent upon human vision and dermatologist s expertise .",
    "computerized dermoscopic image analysis systems , based on a consistent extraction and analysis of image features , do not have the limitation of this subjectivity .",
    "these systems involve the use of a computer as a second independent and objective diagnostic method , which can potentially be used for the pre - screening of patients performed by non - experienced operators .",
    "although computerized analysis techniques can not provide a definitive diagnosis , they can improve biopsy decision - making , which some observers feel is the most important use for dermoscopy @xcite .",
    "recently , numerous researches on this topic propose systems for the automated detection of malignant melanoma in skin lesions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our previous study on dermoscopic images @xcite , the segmentation of the skin area and the lesion area was achieved by a semi - automatic process based on otsu algorithm @xcite , supervised by a human operator . here , we propose a full automatic segmentation method consisting of three main steps : selection of the image roi , selection of the segmentation band , and segmentation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ proposedapproach ]",
    "we describe the proposed algorithm , providing details of its main steps . in section [ expres ]",
    "we provide a thorough analysis of experimental results on the isic 217 dataset @xcite .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusioni ] .",
    "the block diagram of the segmentation algorithm proposed for dermoscopic images , named sdi algorithm , is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : overall ] .",
    "the three main steps are described in the following .          in order to achieve an easier and more accurate segmentation of the skin lesion ,",
    "it is advisable to select the region of interest ( roi ) , i.e. , the subset if image pixels that belong to either the lesion or the skin .",
    "this region excludes image pixels belonging to ( usually dark ) areas of the image border and/or corners , as well as those belonging to hair , that will not be taken into account in the subsequent steps of the sdi algorithm .    in the proposed approach ,",
    "the value band of the image in the hsv color space is chosen in order to select dark image pixels ; these are excluded from the roi if they cover most of the border or the angle regions of the image .    concerning hair ,",
    "many highly accurate methods have been proposed in the literature @xcite . here , we adopted a bottom - hat filter in the red band of the rgb image .",
    "an example of the roi selection process is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : roiselection ] for the isic 2017 test image no . 15544 . here , we observe that the wide dark border on the left of the image , as well as the dark hair over the lesion , have properly been excluded from the roi mask .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we proposed the sdi algorithm for dermoscopic image segmentation , consisting of three main steps : selection of the image roi , selection of the segmentation band , and segmentation .",
    "the reported analysis of experimental results achieved by the sdi algorithm on the isic 2017 dataset allowed us to highlight its pro s and con s .",
    "this leads us to conclude that , although some accurate results can be achieved , there is room for improvements in different directions , that we will go through in future investigations .",
