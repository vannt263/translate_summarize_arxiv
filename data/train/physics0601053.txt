    "in the last several years there has been substantial progress studying the physics of positron binding to atoms . as late as 1997",
    ", there was no rigorous evidence for existence of positron - atom bound states @xcite , although the possibility of positron binding had been often invoked to explain the existence of very large annihilation rates for positrons annihilating in gases @xcite . towards the end of 1997 ,",
    "positron binding to atomic lithium was established in two independent calculations @xcite . following these initial studies ,",
    "positron binding to a further 10 elements of the periodic table was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "one of the features of these positronic atoms is that all the atoms binding a positron have ionization potentials close to 6.80 ev ( the ps binding energy ) and the binding energies are generally larger for the atoms with their ionization energies closest to 6.80 ev .",
    "a related question is whether positrons can form bound states with excited electronic states .",
    "there is one excited atomic state known to bind a positron , namely the metastable he(@xmath1s@xmath4 ) state @xcite .",
    "the stability of @xmath5he(@xmath1s@xmath4 ) state was established with the stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite following an initial inconclusive study by drachman _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the answer to this question is relevant to positron - atom collision physics @xcite , since such states may manifest themselves as feshbach resonances in the elastic or excitation cross sections .",
    "there has been a suggestion that the rich resonant structures prominent in electron - atom scattering @xcite are largely absent from the positron - atom spectrum @xcite .",
    "this work investigates the possibility of positron binding to the low - lying triplet odd state of neutral beryllium , i.e. the be(@xmath0 @xmath1p@xmath2 ) system .",
    "this state has been identified as one of the most likely excited states to bind a positron @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has largely been based upon the fact that its ionization potential ( ip ) of 6.598 ev @xcite is quite close to the ps binding energy .",
    "this ip is between that of magnesium and calcium , both of which bind a positron with a binding energy of @xmath6 0.4 ev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dipole polarisability of be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) is @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite , greater than that of ground state be ( @xmath9 @xmath8 @xcite ) .",
    "this metastable state warrants investigation for another reason ; the parent atom has an angular momentum greater than zero with the loosely bound @xmath10 electron carrying the angular momentum . the quantitative impact that the angular momenta has on the ability to bind a positron is largely unknown .",
    "angular momentum coupling considerations suggests that the existence of a repulsive centrifugal barrier will act to inhibit positron binding by making it less energetically favorable to form a ps - cluster . either",
    ", the electron - positron pair will be in a relative @xmath11-state with a smaller energy gain than the ps(@xmath12 ) state , or the total angular momentum of the ps cluster relative to the nucleus will be greater than zero .",
    "since the ionization energy of the be(@xmath13 @xmath1p@xmath2 ) system is just less than 6.80 ev , the threshold for a stable positron complex is that for the be@xmath3(@xmath14 ) + ps(@xmath12 ) dissociation channel .",
    "this energy was @xmath15 hartree for the present model potential .",
    "an energy level diagram showing the ground and low - lying metastable states of be , and some negative ion and positronic ion energies are shown in figure  [ fig : beenergies ] .",
    "the ci method as applied to positron - atomic systems with two valence electrons and a positron has been discussed previously @xcite , but a short description is worthwhile .",
    "the model hamiltonian is initially based on a hartree - fock ( hf ) wave function for the neutral atom ground state .",
    "one- and two - body semi - empirical polarization potentials are added to the potential field of the hf core and the parameters of the core - polarization potentials defined by reference to the spectrum of be@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "all calculations were done in the frozen - core approximation .",
    "the general effective hamiltonian for the system with @xmath16 valence electrons and a positron was @xmath17 the direct potential ( @xmath18 ) represents the interaction with the hf @xmath19 electron core .",
    "the direct part of the core potential is attractive for electrons and repulsive for the positron .",
    "the exchange potential ( @xmath20 ) between the valence electrons and the hf core was computed without approximation .",
    "the one - body polarization potential ( @xmath21 ) was a semi - empirical polarization potential derived from an analysis of the be@xmath3 spectrum .",
    "it has the functional form @xmath22 the factor @xmath23 is the static dipole polarizability of the core and @xmath24 is a cutoff function designed to make the polarization potential finite at the origin . the same cutoff function has been adopted for both the positron and electrons . in this work ,",
    "@xmath24 was defined to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an adjustable cutoff parameter .",
    "the core dipole polarizability was set to 0.0523 @xmath8 while @xmath26 was set to 0.95 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the two - body polarization potential ( @xmath28 ) is defined as @xmath29 this model potential gives a be(2s2p @xmath1p@xmath2 ) binding energy of 0.91147 hartree with respect to the be@xmath30 threshold .",
    "the experimental binding energy with respect to this threshold is 0.91888 hartree @xcite .",
    "the ci basis was constructed by letting the two electrons and the positron form all the possible total angular momentum @xmath31 configurations , with the two electrons in a spin - triplet state , subject to the selection rules , namely @xmath32 in these rules @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the orbital angular momenta of the positron and the two electrons .",
    "our two - electron - positron calculations with non - zero total angular momentum were first validated against the previous @xmath36 and @xmath37 psh calculations of tachikawa @xcite . using their gaussian - type orbitals we reproduced their reported energy and annihilation rates .",
    "note that the psh states with @xmath36 and @xmath37 are unbound @xcite .    for the @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 )",
    "calculations , the hamiltonian was diagonalized in a ci basis constructed from a very large number of single particle orbitals , including orbitals up to @xmath38 .",
    "there was a minimum of @xmath39 radial basis functions for each @xmath40 .",
    "the largest calculation was performed with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and gave a ci basis dimension of 498750 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian matrix was diagonalized with the davidson algorithm @xcite , and a total of 1376 iterations were required for the largest calculation .",
    "various @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) expectation values , such as energy and mean distance of the electron and positron from the nucleus are given in table [ tab : belmax ] .",
    "the @xmath43 annihilation rate @xcite for annihilation with the core and valence electrons are denoted @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the calculations shown in table [ tab : belmax ] have a minimum of @xmath39 radial basis functions for each @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the largest calculation remains unbound by @xmath46 hartree .    to demonstrate that @xmath42 is sufficient for this system , also shown in table [ tab : belmax ] is the result of a @xmath41 and @xmath47 calculation .",
    "the @xmath48 parameter needs to be large since it determines the extent to which electron - positron correlations are incorporated into the wavefunction .",
    "however , @xmath49 is largely concerned with electron - electron correlations and , for example , setting @xmath42 for the psh and @xmath5be ground states recovered 99.4@xmath50 and 98.5@xmath50 respectively of the ps and positron binding energies for a given @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the main problem afflicting ci calculations of positron - atom interactions is the slow convergence of the expectation values with @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "one way to determine the @xmath51 expectation values is to assume that the successive increments , @xmath52 , to any expectation value @xmath53 scale as @xmath54 as @xmath55 increases @xcite .",
    "however , arguments based on 2nd - order perturbation theory suggests that the energy increments scale asymptotically as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "while existing ci calculations are consistent with this idea @xcite , the actual size of the exponent , @xmath57 is significantly smaller than 4 at @xmath58 .",
    "this can be seen in table [ tab : belmax ] , where the power law factor @xmath57 relating successive @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are tabulated .",
    "applying a simple power law extrapolation with @xmath62 leads to a prediction of binding ( @xmath63 ) , but not much credence should be placed in this since fixing @xmath57 at its @xmath41 value of 2.078 will result in an extrapolation that will overestimate the contribution of the orbitals with @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "an improved method , borrowing from existing work in atomic structure physics @xcite , is to estimate the @xmath51 limit for the energy by assuming that @xmath65 the factors @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are determined from four calculations at successively larger values of @xmath48 . applying eq .",
    "( [ extrap1 ] ) to the data in table [ tab : belmax ] at @xmath69 one finds @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 hartree as our present best energy estimate .",
    "this is @xmath74 hartree higher the threshold for binding at @xmath15 hartree .",
    "usage of an inverse power series restricted to the first two terms of eq .",
    "( [ extrap1 ] ) results in @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and an @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) energy of @xmath77 , which is also unbound .",
    "as has been seen in other ci calculations of positron - atom systems , even when the three - term and the two - term coefficents are significantly different , their extrapolated energies can still lie relatively close together @xcite .",
    "there are two aspects where convergence can be incomplete . besides the size of @xmath48 , the number of ltos for each value of @xmath40 still needs to be further increased .",
    "this is best seen in figure  [ fig : lmax ] which depicts the energies as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "two sets of @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) data are shown , the first shows the @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) energies from table [ tab : belmax ] which used 12 ltos , and their extrapolated estimates using eq .",
    "( [ extrap1 ] ) .",
    "the second set shows the results from initial exploratory calculations also with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but only with a minimum of @xmath78 ltos per @xmath40 .",
    "even a cursory glance at figure  [ fig : lmax ] suggests that the ci prognosis for variationally establishing the existence of a bound state is not promising . also shown in figure",
    "[ fig : lmax ] are the be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) energies using the underlying @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) basis without the positron ( the 12 ltos basis ) .",
    "even though the valence annihilation rate from the largest calculation is only @xmath79 sec@xmath80 , the slow convergence of @xmath45 with @xmath48 suggests the presence of a well defined ps cluster . fitting the four largest @xmath45 calculations in table [ tab : belmax ] to the three - term form",
    "@xmath81 results in an extrapolated annihilation rate of @xmath82 sec@xmath80 .",
    "however , this value should be regarded as only notional . after all , if this system is indeed unbound , @xmath45 should approach @xmath83 sec@xmath80 in the limit of an infinite radial basis @xcite .",
    "it is also noticed that @xmath84 in table [ tab : belmax ] steadily decreases as @xmath48 increases .",
    "this also should not be taken as an indicator of binding since the behavior of @xmath84 with @xmath48 is not straightforward .",
    "for example , the psh @xmath84 decreases when @xmath48 changes from 0 to 3 , but then starts increasing as @xmath48 increases from 3 to 9 @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is a trend noticed in ci calculations of positronic atoms with @xmath85ev ( eg . @xmath5li @xcite , @xmath5ca and @xmath5sr @xcite ) , which have shown an initial @xmath84 decrease to a minimum , which then increases as @xmath86 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath84 with @xmath48 for an unbound system is unknown .",
    "a large - scale ci calculation of the @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) ground state has been performed .",
    "the largest calculation gave an energy that was @xmath87 hartree above the threshold for binding .",
    "using an extrapolation method to estimate the contribution from the higher - partial waves gave an energy that was @xmath88 hartree above threshold . by its very nature",
    "the present calculation is unable to give definitive proof that the @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) system does not have a bound state . while a variational calculation of the present kind can be used to give proof of binding , it can not be used to give proof of non - binding . a converged calculation of low energy be@xmath3-ps(@xmath12 ) scattering in the @xmath89p@xmath2 channel would be needed to establish lack of binding .",
    "what can be inferred from the present calculation is that a @xmath5be(@xmath1p@xmath2 ) bound state ( assuming one existed ) would have a structure similar to positronic lithium , i.e. it would consist of a ps - like object weakly bound to the be@xmath3(@xmath14 ) core .",
    "the size of the ci expansion required to establish binding would be enormous .",
    "for example , it is necessary to include orbitals with @xmath90 to get an energy that is lower than the ps + li@xmath3 threshold @xcite .",
    "another conclusion is that the existence of centrifugal barriers does seem to inhibit the binding of positrons to parent atoms with non - zero angular momentum .",
