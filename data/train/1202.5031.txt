    "we consider six infinite families of special functions which can be derived from the compact simple lie groups of types @xmath6 these are all the simple lie groups with roots of two different lengths .",
    "one of the six families has been described previously @xcite .",
    "the other families are new .    within each of the six family ,",
    "the functions ( i ) depend of @xmath7 real variables , @xmath7 being the rank of the underlying simple lie group ; ( ii ) are periodic in various ways over the entire real euclidean space @xmath8 ; ( iii ) are pairwise orthogonal when integrated over a finite ( ` fundamental ' ) region of @xmath8 ; ( iv ) are pairwise orthogonal when their values , sampled at lattice fragment in the fundamental region , are summed up , the lattice being of any density and of symmetry dictated by the underlying group .",
    "we limit our considerations to the lie groups of rank two , namely the groups @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "their lie algebras are denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "there are neither principal nor technical obstacles to generalize the results of this paper to simple lie groups of type of ranks greater than 2 .    a basic tool for defining the functions are the particular subgroups @xmath12 of the finite reflection group @xmath13 , which is the symmetry group of the root systems of the groups .",
    "these subgroups are called the even subgroups of @xmath13 .",
    "they are of index 2 in @xmath13 and it is seen from the orders of the reflection groups that they are not reflection generated groups .",
    "in addition to the well known and extensively studied @xcite symmetric ( @xmath14-  ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath15-  ) functions of the weyl group orbit , new families of @xmath13-orbit functions for the groups , called @xmath16-   and @xmath17-  , were recently discovered . in @xcite , functions defined using the subgroup @xmath18 , called @xmath0-functions , were studied .",
    "those functions are defined for every compact simple lie group @xcite and they can be written as sums of symmetric and antisymmetric orbit functions ( symbolically written as @xmath19 ) . by considering the sums of pairs of the functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 built using the same weyl group we obtain 6 families of @xmath20functions : we use the following notation for those functions @xmath21 in this paper we use a different approach to construct the @xmath20functions using the sign homomorphisms ( section  [ homo ] ) .",
    "general motivation @xcite for the study of @xmath0-functions of two variables resides in the processing of digitally given data .",
    "the advantage of having a larger choice of families of functions is the fact that they are orthogonal in regions of different shapes , which can be more suitable for the particular data .",
    "combined with the relative simplicity of these functions , one expects that the processing speed could be increased .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review some basic facts from the theory of weyl groups . in section 3",
    "the sign homomorphisms and their kernels are introduced .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present in detail the even orbit function and the mixed even orbit function .",
    "the product of the @xmath20functions is studied in the section 6 .",
    "the ordered set of simple roots @xmath22 of a simple lie algebra of rank @xmath23 is a collection of @xmath23 vectors spanning a real @xmath24dimensional euclidean space @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the simple roots of @xmath26 form a basis of @xmath25 satisfying certain specific conditions .",
    "these roots are specified by their lengths and the angle between them .",
    "equivalently , the root system @xmath26 can be determined either by the coxeter ",

    "it is advantageous to distinguish explicitly the different root lengths in @xmath76 and @xmath11 . instead of the generic set of simple roots of rank @xmath23 of the form @xmath22 , we use the following notation @xmath77 the symbol @xmath78 denotes the short simple root . for @xmath76 we use the standard normalization @xmath79 and for @xmath11 we have @xmath80 .",
