    "the existence of a clear observational distinction between massive star clusters and low - mass galaxies has been substantially strengthened recently , both through detailed studies of more luminous and massive star clusters in a wide range of environments , and through discovery of a large number of extremely low - luminosity satellite galaxies around the milky way ( e.g.  willman et al .",
    "2005 ; belokurov et al .",
    "2007)and around m31 , mostly based on imaging from the sdss , usually with supplementary - and crucial !",
    " subaru studies .",
    "1 shows the current sample in a plot of half - light radius against absolute magnitude in the v - band .",
    "star clusters in all studied environments , with luminosities over the whole range from m@xmath5 ,",
    "l@xmath6  l@xmath7 , up to m@xmath8 , l@xmath9 , and a wide range of ages , invariably have characteristic scale sizes @xmath10 less than about 30pc .",
    "thus the dynamical range over which both star clusters and galaxies exist , and over which there is a distinct size dichotomy , has now been established to cover some six orders of magnitude in stellar luminosity .",
    "figure  1 makes evident that there is a robust maximum radius to star clusters , at all luminosities .",
    "figure  1 also illustrates that the dsph galaxies in both the milky way and in m31 have a minimum characteristic radius , and this minimum is a factor of @xmath11 larger than the largest star clusters . with the exception of the recently discovered object comaber ( belokurov et al .",
    "2007 )  the largest and brightest of the four systems indicated by open stars in fig .  1",
    " there is no known object in the size - gap between @xmath12pc and @xmath13pc .",
    "comaber manifestly merits further study , but is one of the new dsph which lie between the sgr dwarf and the magellanic clouds , and which show significant indications of tidal disruption .",
    "it is more correct to say that , modulo comber , there is no known stable object in the size gap .",
    "fig  1 ( lower panel ) illustrates this further , showing that all possible transition objects are in a tidally - affected region , close to the galactic centre .",
    "this intermediate size can be occupied transiently by a larger object ( a dwarf galaxy ) in the very late stages of disruption by external ( galactic ) tides , or by a small object ( globular cluster ) in the last stages of evaporation . in the first of these cases a low velocity dispersion compact core",
    "can be generated transiently , if outer , hotter , stars are removed by a suitable tide . in the second case the density profile changes systematically from the small scale typical of a compact star cluster to a very large scale , almost constant density , covering all possible radii during that ( short - lived ) process .",
    "segue  1 , will  1 and boo - ii are also newly discovered and interesting tests of the conclusions of this section , with all showing photometric evidence for significant tidal disturbance .",
    "the two largest galactic globular clusters are pal  14 , with size 28  pc , and pal  5 , 24  pc .",
    "pal  5 is in an advanced stage of tidal disruption , with prominent streams of stripped stars ( @xcite ) .    the largest ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) , also with size 25pc ,",
    "are associated with the centre of the virgo cluster , and the galaxy m87 , and were for a long time suspected of being small galaxies severely affected by tides .",
    "our interpretation of their status , based on their position in figure  1 , is that they are simply very massive star clusters , with no associated dark matter , perhaps embedded in a lower surface brightness galaxy which has an associated dark matter halo .",
    "there are two recent detailed dynamical analyses of the masses of ultra compact dwarf galaxies , by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "they show that all these systems are similar , in structure and dynamics , and that the dynamical mass - to - light ratios for the ucds are ( almost ) consistent with simple stellar models : there is no evidence for any dark matter associated with these objects .",
    "they are the ( very ) high - mass / high - luminosity extreme of more typical globular cluster populations .",
    "we note a recent study by @xcite which has 2 ucd and one compact elliptical in or close to the size gap .",
    "the compact elliptical is m32 , which is in tidal interaction with m31 .",
    "the 2 ucds are in fact systems in which there is a small ucd ( radius 10pc ) embedded in an extended ( 200pc ) halo .",
    "the plotted size is the mean of these two , and is not the ucd .",
    "the size gap remains empty of stable objects .",
    "we have apparently really identified a minimum size for a galaxy .",
    "we can know more than just the sizes of the dsph galaxies .",
    "extensive kinematic studies provide the information to determine dark mass profiles in these galaxies . @xcite",
    "describe in detail the current status of a uniform jeans-equation based study .",
    "fig  2 here summarises that information .",
    "we conclude that the jeans analysis demonstrates that the observed velocity dispersion profiles and cored light distributions of dsphs are consistent with their inhabiting dark matter haloes with central cores . where sufficient data exist , more sophisticated distribution function modelling also , in every case studied , produces a small preference for cored dark matter mass distributions at small scales .",
    "we find no evidence in any case to support the cusped profile predicted by standard cdm models .",
    "the implications of this are discussed further by @xcite , and summarised in our abstract .",
    "briefly , it seems that all dsph galaxies have cored mass distributions , with surprisingly low central mass densities .",
    "this mass distribution is associated with an even more surprising large spatial scale length .",
    "the central mass densities seen are of order 10gev / c@xmath3 cm@xmath1 , while we note that the mass scale of the higgs , and its heavier partners , is above 100 gev / c@xmath3 per particle .",
    "the corresponding length scales are of order @xmath14 m , significantly longer than expected for extremely low velocity dispersion ` cold ' particles ."
