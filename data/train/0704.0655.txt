    "variability is an important phenomenon in astrophysical studies of structure and evolution , both stellar and galactic .",
    "some variable stars , such as rr lyrae , are an excellent tool for studying the galaxy .",
    "being nearly standard candles ( thus making distance determination relatively straightforward ) and being intrinsically bright , they are a particularly suitable tracer of galactic structure . in extragalactic astronomy , the optical continuum variability of quasars is utilized as an efficient method for their discovery @xcite , and is also frequently used to constrain the origin of their emission @xcite .    despite the importance of variability ,",
    "the variable optical sky remains largely unexplored and poorly quantified , especially at the faint end . to",
    "what degree different variable populations contribute to the overall variability , how they are distributed in magnitude and color , what the characteristic time - scales and the dominant mechanisms of variability are , are just some of the questions that still remain to be answered .",
    "to address these questions , several contemporary projects aimed at regular monitoring of the optical sky were started .",
    "some of the more prominent surveys in terms of the sky coverage , depth , and cadence are :    * the faint sky variability survey @xcite is a very deep ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 survey of 23 deg@xmath3 of sky , containing about 80,000 sources sampled at timescales ranging from minutes to years . *",
    "the quest survey @xcite monitors 700 deg@xmath3 of sky from @xmath20 to a limit of @xmath21 .",
    "* rotse - i @xcite monitors the entire observable sky twice a night from @xmath22 to a limit of @xmath23 .",
    "the northern sky variability survey @xcite is based on rotse - i data . *",
    "ogle ( most recently ogle iii ; @xcite ) monitors @xmath24 deg@xmath3 towards the galactic bulge from @xmath25 to a limit of @xmath26 . due to the very high stellar density towards the bulge ,",
    "ogle ii has detected about 270,000 variable stars @xcite . *",
    "the macho project monitored the brightness of @xmath27 million stars in @xmath28 deg@xmath3 of sky toward the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge for @xmath29 years to a limit of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of past and ongoing variability surveys can be found in @xcite .    recognizing the outstanding importance of variable objects , the last decadal survey report @xcite highly recommended a major new initiative for studying the variable sky , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lsst will offer an unprecedented view of the faint variable sky : according to the current designs it will scan the entire accessible sky every three nights to a limit of @xmath31 with two observations per night in two different bands ( selected from a set of six )",
    ". one of the lsst science goals will be the exploration of the transient optical sky : the discovery and analysis of rare and exotic objects ( e.g. neutron star and black hole binaries ) , gamma - ray bursts , x - ray flashes , and of new classes of transients , such as binary mergers and stellar disruptions by black holes . the observed volume of space , and the requirement to recognize and monitor these events  in real time  on a `` normally '' variable sky , will present a challenge to the project .    since lsst will utilize band at @xmath32 @xmath33 . for more details",
    "see the lsst science requirement document at ] the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) photometric system ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) , multiple photometric observations obtained by the sdss represent an excellent dataset for a pre - lsst study that characterizes the faint variable sky and quantifies the variable population and its distribution in magnitude - color - variability space . here",
    "we present such a study of unresolved sources in a region that has been imaged multiple times by the sdss .    in section  [ data ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the sdss imaging survey and repeated scans of a @xmath2 deg@xmath3 region called stripe 82 . in section",
    "[ analysis ] , we describe methods used to select candidate variable sources from the sdss stripe 82 data assembled , averaged and recalibrated by @xcite , and present tests that show the robustness of the adopted selection criteria . in the same section , we discuss the distribution of selected variable sources in magnitude - color - variability space . the milky way halo structure traced by selected candidate rr lyrae stars",
    "is discussed in section  [ rrlyr ] , and in section  [ qso ] we estimate the fraction of variable quasars .",
    "implications for surveys such as the lsst are discussed in section  [ lsstsec ] , and our main results are summarized in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the quality of photometry and astrometry , as well as the large area covered by the survey , make the sdss stand out among available optical sky surveys @xcite .",
    "the sdss is providing homogeneous and deep ( @xmath34 ) photometry in five bandpasses ( @xmath35 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , @xcite ) accurate to 0.02 mag ( root - mean - square scatter , hereafter rms ) for unresolved sources not limited by photon statistics @xcite , and with a zeropoint uncertainty of 0.02 mag @xcite .",
    "the survey sky coverage of 10,000 deg@xmath3 in the northern galactic cap , and 300 deg@xmath3 in the southern galactic cap will result in photometric measurements for well over 100 million stars and a similar number of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the recent data release 5 @xcite lists photometric data for 215 million unique objects observed in 8000 deg@xmath3 of sky as part of the `` sdss - i '' phase that ran through june 2005 .",
    "astrometric positions are accurate to better than @xmath38 per coordinate ( rms ) for sources with @xmath39 @xcite , and the morphological information from the images allows reliable star - galaxy separation to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the 5-band sdss photometry can be used for very detailed source classification ; e.g.  separation of quasars and stars @xcite , spectral classification of stars to within 1 - 2 spectral subtypes @xcite , and even remarkably efficient color selection of the horizontal branch and rr lyrae stars @xcite and low - metallicity g and k giants @xcite .",
    "the equatorial stripe 82 region ( 22h 24 m  @xmath0  04h 08 m , @xmath41 , @xmath2 deg@xmath3 ) , observed in the southern galactic cap , presents a valuable data source for variability studies .",
    "the region was repeatedly observed ( 65 imaging runs by july 2005 , but not all cover the entire region ) , and it is the largest source of multi - epoch data in the sdss - i phase .",
    "another source of the large number of scans is the sdss - ii supernova survey @xcite . by averaging the repeated observations of stripe 82 sources , more accurate photometry than the nominal 0.02 mag single - scan accuracy can be achieved .",
    "this motivated @xcite to produce a catalog of recalibrated stripe 82 observations .",
    "the catalog lists 58 million photometric observations for 1.4 million unresolved sources that were observed at least 4 times in each of the @xmath5 bands ( with a median of 10 observations obtained over @xmath42 years ) .",
    "the random photometric errors for psf ( point spread function ) magnitudes are below 0.01 mag for stars brighter than 19.5 , 20.5 , 20.5 , 20 , 18.5 in @xmath4 , respectively ( about twice as accurate for individual sdss runs ) , and the spatial variation of photometric zeropoints is not larger than @xmath60.01 mag ( rms ) .",
    "following @xcite , we use psf magnitudes because they go deeper at a given signal - to - noise ratio than aperture magnitudes , and have more accurate photometric error estimates than model magnitudes .",
    "in addition , various low - order statistics such as root - mean - square scatter ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath7 per degree of freedom ( @xmath7 ) , lightcurve skewness ( @xmath44 ) , minimum and maximum psf magnitude , were computed for each @xmath4 band and each source .",
    "we compute @xmath7 per degree of freedom as @xmath45 and lightcurve skewness @xmath44 as @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of detections , @xmath50 is the magnitude , @xmath51 is the mean magnitude , and @xmath52 is the photometric error .",
    "separation of quasars and stars , as well as efficient color selection of horizontal branch and rr lyrae stars , depend on accurate @xmath35 band photometry . to ensure this",
    ", we select 748,084 unresolved sources from the @xcite catalog with at least 4 detections in the @xmath35 band .",
    "a catalog of variable sources selected from this sample is analyzed in section  [ analysis ] below .",
    "in this section we describe methods for selecting candidate variable sources , and present tests that show the robustness of the adopted selection criteria .",
    "the distribution of selected variable sources in magnitude - color - variability space is also presented .",
    "due to a relatively small number of observations per source and random sampling , we do not perform lightcurve fitting , but instead use low order statistics to select candidate variables and study their properties",
    ". there are four parameters ( median psf magnitude , root - mean - square scatter @xmath43 , @xmath7 , and lightcurve skewness @xmath44 ) measured in five photometric bands ( @xmath35 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) , for a total of 20 parameters . in the analysis presented here",
    ", we utilize eight of them :    * median psf magnitudes in the @xmath53 bands ( corrected for interstellar extinction using the map from @xcite ) because the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram has the most classification power ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . * @xmath43 and @xmath7 in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , and * lightcurve skewness @xmath54 ( the @xmath10 band combines a high signal - to - noise ratio and large variability amplitude for the majority of variable sources ) .",
    "the observed root - mean - square scatter @xmath43 includes both the intrinsic variability @xmath55 and the mean photometric error @xmath56 as a function of magnitude .",
    "the dependence of @xmath43 on magnitude in the @xmath4 bands , is shown in figure  [ phot_acc ] . for sources brighter than 18 , 19.5 , 19.5 , 19 , and 17.5 mag in the @xmath4 , respectively",
    ", the sdss delivers @xmath8 photometry with little or no dependence on magnitude .",
    "we determine @xmath56 by fitting a fourth degree polynomial to median @xmath43 values in 0.5 mag wide bins ( here we assume that the majority of sources are not variable ) . the theoretically expected @xmath56 function @xcite @xmath57 provides equally good fits .",
    "we define the intrinsic variability @xmath55 ( hereafter rms scatter @xmath55 ) as @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 otherwise .    as the first variability selection criterion",
    ", we adopt @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag ( hereafter written as @xmath63 mag ) . at the bright end , this criterion is equivalent to selecting sources with rms scatter greater than @xmath64 , where @xmath65 mag is the measurement noise .",
    "selection cuts are applied simultaneously in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands to reduce the number of `` false positives '' ( intrinsically non - variable sources selected as candidate variable sources due to measurement noise ) . about @xmath66 of sources",
    "pass the @xmath55 cut in each band separately , and @xmath67 of sources pass the cut in both bands simultaneously . by selecting sources with @xmath63 mag",
    ", we also select faint sources that have large @xmath55 due to large photometric errors at the faint end .",
    "to only select faint sources with statistically significant rms scatter , we apply the @xmath7 test as the second selection cut .    in the @xmath7 test , the value of @xmath7 per degree of freedom ( calculated with respect to a weighted mean magnitude and using errors computed by the photometric pipeline ) determines whether the observed lightcurve is consistent with the gaussian distribution of errors .",
    "large @xmath7 values show that the rms scatter is inconsistent with random fluctuations .",
    "@xcite used multi - epoch sdss observations to show that the photometric error distribution in the sdss roughly follows a gaussian distribution . a comparison of @xmath7 distributions in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands with a reference gaussian @xmath7 distribution is shown in figure  [ chi_cum ] . as evident ,",
    "@xmath7 distributions in both bands roughly follow the reference gaussian @xmath7 distribution for @xmath68 , demonstrating that median photometric errors are correctly determined .",
    "the discrepancy for larger @xmath7 is due to variable sources rather than non - gaussian error distributions , as we demonstrate below .",
    "the second selection cut , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( hereafter written as @xmath71 ) , selects @xmath72 of @xmath63 mag sources , as shown in figure  [ chi_cum ] ( middle panels ) .",
    "the effectiveness of the @xmath7 test is demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ chi_cum ] . for magnitudes fainter than @xmath9 ,",
    "the fraction of candidate variables decreases as photometric errors increase .",
    "the selection is relatively uniform for sources brighter than @xmath9 , and we adopt this value as the flux limit for the selected variable sample",
    ".    there are 662,195 sources brighter than @xmath9 in the full sample . using @xmath63 mag and @xmath71 as the selection criteria , we select 13,051 candidate variable sources .",
    "therefore , _ at least @xmath8 of unresolved optical sources",
    "brighter than @xmath9 appear variable at the @xmath73 mag level ( rms ) simultaneously in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands_. the fraction of selected variable sources is not a strong function of the minimum required number of observations , but it does depend on the stellar density because the number of stars increases at lower galactic latitudes ( see fig .  5 in @xcite ) while the quasar count remains the same .      in this section",
    "we estimate the completeness and efficiency of the candidate variable sample , and discuss the dependence of counts , rms scatter , @xmath74 ratio , and the lightcurve skewness @xmath54 on the position in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram .      the selection completeness , defined as the fraction of true variable sources recovered by the algorithm , depends on the lightcurve shape and amplitudes . due to a fairly large number of observations ( median of 10 ) , and small @xmath75 cutoff compared to typical amplitudes of variable sources ( e.g. most rr lyrae stars and quasars have peak - to - peak amplitudes @xmath32 mag ) , we expect the completeness to be fairly high for rr lyrae stars ( @xmath76 , see section  [ rrlyr ] ) and quasars ( @xmath72 , see section  [ qso ] ) . the completeness for other types of variable sources , such as flares and eclipsing binaries , is hard to estimate , but is probably low due to sparse sampling .",
    "the selection efficiency , defined as the fraction of true variable sources in the candidate variable sample , determines the robustness of the selection algorithm .",
    "the main diagnostic for the robustness of the adopted selection criteria is the distribution of selected candidates in the sdss color - magnitude and color - color diagrams .",
    "the position of a source in these diagrams is a good proxy for its spectral classification @xcite .",
    "figure  [ map_counts ] compares the distribution of candidate variable sources to that of all sources in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram . were the selection a random process",
    ", the selected candidates would have the same distribution as the full sample .",
    "the distributions of candidate variables and of the full sample are remarkably different , demonstrating that the candidate variables are _ not _ randomly selected from the parent sample .",
    "the three dominant classes of variable objects are quasars , rr lyrae stars , and stars from the main stellar locus .",
    "the most obvious difference between the variable and the full sample distributions is a much higher fraction of low - redshift quasars ( @xmath77 , recognized by their uv excess , @xmath78 , see @xcite ) and rr lyrae stars ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , see @xcite ) in the variable sample , and vividly shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ map_counts ] .",
    "another interesting feature visible in this panel is a gradient in the fraction of variable main stellar locus stars ( perpendicular to the main stellar locus ) .",
    "we investigate this gradient by first defining principal colors @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are principal axis parallel and perpendicular to the main stellar locus , respectively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath84 color is a measure of metallicity @xcite , and @xmath85 stars are expected to be metal poor @xcite .",
    "sources with @xmath86 and @xmath87 are selected and binned in four @xmath84 bins . for each bin",
    "we calculate the fraction of source with @xmath88 mag , the fraction of variable sources ( selected with @xmath63 mag and @xmath71 ) , median @xmath89 , and the total number of sources in the bin ( see table  [ principal ] )",
    ". a greater fraction of variable sources in the last bin ( @xmath90 ) indicates that , on average , metal - poor main stellar locus stars are more variable than the metal - rich stars .",
    "this could be because this sample of metal - poor stars is expected to have a high fraction of giants .    in order to quantify the differences between the full and the variable sample , we follow @xcite and divide the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram into six characteristic regions ,",
    "each dominated by a particular type of source , as shown in figure  [ rmsg_col ] .",
    "the fractions and counts of variable and all sources in each region are listed in table  [ regions ] for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 flux - limited samples .",
    "notably , in the adopted @xmath92 flux limit , the fraction of region ii sources ( dominated by low - redshift quasars ) in the variable sample is @xmath94 , or @xmath95 times greater than the fraction of region ii sources in the full sample ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the fraction of region iv sources ( which include rr lyrae stars ) in the variable sample is also high when compared to the full sample ( @xmath97 times higher ) .    as shown in table  [ regions ] , in the @xmath9 flux - limited sample , we find that low - redshift quasars and rr lyrae stars ( i.e. regions ii and iv ) make @xmath98 of the variable population , while representing only @xmath99 of all sources .",
    "quasars alone account for @xmath94 of the variable population .",
    "stars from the main stellar locus represent @xmath100 of all sources and @xmath101 of the variable sample : about @xmath14 of the stars from the locus are variable at the @xmath73 mag level .      various lightcurve properties , such as shape and amplitude ,",
    "are expected to be correlated with stellar types . in this section",
    "we study the distribution of the rms scatter in the @xmath35 and @xmath10 bands , and @xmath74 ratio as a function of the @xmath16 and @xmath15 colors .",
    "to emphasize trends , we bin sources and present median values for each bin .    the distribution of the median @xmath102 and @xmath89 values in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram is shown in the top two panels of figure  [ med_rms ] .",
    "rr lyrae stars show larger rms scatter ( @xmath103 mag ) in the @xmath35 and @xmath10 bands , than low - redshift quasars or stars from the main stellar locus .",
    "quasars also show slightly larger rms scatter in the @xmath35 band ( @xmath104 mag ) than in the @xmath10 band ( @xmath105 mag ) , as discussed by @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite .",
    "if we define the degree of variability as the root - mean - square scatter in the @xmath10 band , then on average rr lyrae stars show the greatest variability , followed by quasars and the main stellar locus stars .",
    "another distinctive characteristic of variable sources is the ratio of flux changes in different bandpasses .",
    "this property can be used to select different types of variable sources .",
    "for example , rr lyrae stars are bluer when brighter , a behavior used by @xcite to select rr lyrae using 2-epoch sdss data . here",
    "we define a new parameter , @xmath74 , to express the ratio of flux changes in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , and study its distribution in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram .",
    "in particular , we examine this distribution and its median values for three dominant classes of variable sources : quasars , rr lyrae stars , and stars from the main stellar locus .",
    "the bottom left panel in figure  [ med_rms ] shows the distribution of median @xmath74 values as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 colors . using fig .",
    "[ med_rms ] we note that on average :    * rr lyrae stars have @xmath106 * main stellar locus stars have @xmath107 , and * quasars show a @xmath74 gradient in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram .",
    "the average value of @xmath106 in region iv indicates that rr lyrae stars dominate the variable source count in this region .",
    "the ratio of 1.4 for rr lyrae stars was also previously found by @xcite . while figure  [ med_rms ] only presents median values of the rms scatter , figure  [ plot_bayes ]",
    "shows how the rms scatter in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands correlates with the @xmath16 color for individual sources .",
    "variable sources that follow the @xmath108 relation also correlate with the @xmath16 color , and have @xmath109 , as expected for rr lyrae stars .",
    "the average ratio of @xmath107 ( i.e. gray flux variations ) for stars in the main stellar locus suggests that the variability could be caused by eclipsing systems .",
    "the distribution of @xmath54 for main stellar locus stars further strengthens this possibility , as discussed in section  [ skewness ] below .",
    "the gradient in the @xmath74 ratio observed for low - redshift quasars in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram suggests that the variability correlation between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands is more complex than in the case of rr lyrae or main stellar locus stars .",
    "@xcite show that the photometric color changes for quasars depend on the combined effects of continuum changes , emission - line changes , redshift , and the selection of photometric bandpasses .",
    "they note that due to the lack of variability of the lines , measured photometric color is not always bluer in brighter phases , but depends on redshift and the filters used . to verify the dependence of broad - band photometric variability on redshift , we plot @xmath74 vs.  redshift for all spectroscopically confirmed unresolved quasars from @xcite which are in stripe 82 , as shown in figure  [ qso_redshift ] .",
    "we confirm that the broad - band photometric variability depends on the redshift , and that the @xmath74 gradient in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram can be explained by the increase in @xmath74 from @xmath32 to @xmath110 in the 1.0 to 1.6 redshift range .",
    "this effect is due to the mg ii emission line ( more stable in flux than the continuum ) moving through the @xmath11 band filter over this redshift range .",
    "the implied correlation of the @xmath16 and @xmath15 colors with redshift is consistent with the discussion by @xcite .",
    "the lack of noticeable correlation of @xmath89 with redshift is due to the combined effects of the dependence of @xmath89 on the rest - frame wavelength and time which cancel out ( for a detailed model see @xcite ) .",
    "lightcurve skewness , a measure of the lightcurve asymmetry , provides additional information on the type of variability .",
    "negatively skewed , asymmetric lightcurves indicate variable sources that spend more time fainter than @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are magnitudes at the minimum and maximum .",
    "type @xmath114 rr lyrae stars , for example , have negatively skewed lightcurves ( @xmath115 , @xcite ) .",
    "positively skewed , asymmetric lightcurves indicate variable sources that spend more time brighter than @xmath111 ( e.g. eclipsing systems ) .",
    "sources with symmetric lightcurves will have @xmath116 .",
    "the bottom right panel in figure  [ med_rms ] shows the distribution of the median @xmath54 as a function of the position in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram . on average , quasars and @xmath117 type rr lyrae stars ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 )",
    "have @xmath120 , @xmath114 type rr lyrae ( @xmath118 , @xmath121 ) have negative skewness ( @xmath122 ) , and stars in the main stellar locus have positive skewness .",
    "figure  [ skew_hist ] shows the distribution of the lightcurve skewness in the @xmath123 bands for spectroscopically confirmed unresolved quasars from @xcite which are in stripe 82 , candidate rr lyrae stars ( selection details are discussed in section  [ rrlyr ] below ) , and main stellar locus stars from our variable sample . stars in the main stellar locus show a bimodal @xmath54 distribution .",
    "this distribution suggests at least two , and perhaps more , different populations of variables .",
    "indeed , when spectroscopically confirmed m dwarfs are selected , a third peak appears at @xmath124 , possibly associated with flaring m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the bimodality similar to the one in the @xmath10 band is also discernible in the @xmath11 band , while it is less pronounced in the @xmath36 band and not detected in the @xmath35 and @xmath37 bands ( the @xmath11 and @xmath37 data are not shown ) .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath16 and @xmath15 color distributions for variable main stellar locus stars brighter than @xmath125 and a subset with highly asymmetric lightcurves ( @xmath126 ) is shown in figure  [ skew_loc ] .",
    "the subset with asymmetric lightcurves has an increased fraction of stars with colors @xmath127 and @xmath128 , that correspond to m stars .",
    "this may indicate that m stars have a higher probability of being associated with an eclipsing companion than stars with earlier spectral types .",
    "however , the selection effects are probably important since a companion is easier to detect ( due to the low luminosity of m dwarfs ) .",
    "@xcite examine these issues using lightcurve data on a sample of spectroscopically confirmed m dwarfs .",
    "finally , quasars have symmetric lightcurves ( @xmath116 ) and their distribution of skewness does not change between bands .",
    "studies of substructures in the galactic halo , such as clumps and streams , can constrain the formation history of the milky way .",
    "one of the best tracers to study the outer halo are rr lyrae stars because they are nearly standard candles , are sufficiently bright to be detected at large distances ( @xmath129 kpc for @xmath130 ) , and are sufficiently numerous to trace the halo substructure with a high spatial resolution .",
    "the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs ; @xcite ) lists rr lyrae stars as rr lyrae type @xmath114 ( rrab ) and type @xmath117 ( rrc ) stars .",
    "rrab stars have asymmetric lightcurves , periods from 0.3 to 1.2 days , and amplitudes from @xmath131 to @xmath132 .",
    "rrc stars have nearly symmetric , sometimes sinusoidal , lightcurves , with periods from 0.2 to 0.5 days , and amplitudes not greater than @xmath133 . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath134 as the absolute @xmath135 band magnitude of rrab and rrc stars . a comprehensive review of rr lyrae stars can be found in @xcite .    in this section we fine tune criteria for selecting candidate rr lyrae stars , and estimate the selection completeness and efficiency . using selected candidate rr lyrae stars ,",
    "we recover a known halo clump associated with the sgr dwarf tidal stream , and find several new halo substructures .      figures  [ map_counts ] ,  [ rmsg_col ] , and  [ med_rms ] show that rr lyrae stars occupy a well - defined region ( region iv ) in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram , and figure  [ plot_bayes ] shows how rr lyrae stars follow the @xmath108 relation .",
    "motivated by these results , we introduce color and @xmath74 cuts to specifically select candidate rr lyrae stars from the variable sample , and study their distribution in the rms  scatter - color - lightcurve  skewness parameter space .",
    "rr lyrae stars have distinctive colors and can be selected with the following criteria @xcite : @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142    we apply these cuts to our sample of candidate variables and select 846 sources .",
    "it is implied by @xcite that rr lyrae should always stay within these color boundaries , even though their colors change as a function of phase .",
    "their distribution in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram and rms scatter in the @xmath10 band are shown in figure  [ rrbox ] ( top left panel ) .",
    "the distribution of sources in the rr lyrae region is inhomogeneous .",
    "sources with large rms scatter in the @xmath10 band ( @xmath143 mag ) are centered around @xmath118 , and are separated by @xmath144 into two groups .",
    "a comparison with figure  3 from @xcite suggests that these large rms scatter sources might be rr lyrae type @xmath114 ( rrab , @xmath145 ) and type @xmath117 stars ( rrc , @xmath146 ) .",
    "small rms scatter sources ( @xmath147 mag ) have a fairly uniform distribution , and are slightly bluer with @xmath148 .",
    "the distribution of sources from the rr lyrae region in the @xmath149 vs.  @xmath89 diagram is presented in the top right panel of figure  [ rrbox ] .",
    "the majority of large rms scatter sources follow the @xmath108 relation , as expected for rr lyrae stars . since rr lyrae stars are bluer when brighter , or equivalently , have greater rms scatter in the @xmath10 band than in the @xmath11 band , we require @xmath150 and select 683 candidate rr lyrae stars .    a comparison of @xmath16 color distributions for candidate rr lyrae stars and of sources with rr lyrae colors , but not tagged as rr lyrae stars , presented in the bottom left panel of figure  [ rrbox ] , demonstrates the robustness of the rr lyrae selection .",
    "the two distributions are very different ( the probability that they are the same is @xmath151 , as given by the ks test ) , with the candidate rr lyrae distribution peaking at @xmath118 , as expected for rr lyrae stars .",
    "one property that distinguishes rrab from rrc stars is the shape ( or skewness ) of their lightcurves ( in addition to lightcurve amplitude and period ) .",
    "rrab stars have asymmetric lightcurves , while rrc lightcurves are symmetric . in the top left panel of figure  [ rrbox ]",
    ", we noted that @xmath144 seemingly separates high rms scatter sources into two groups .",
    "if @xmath144 is the boundary between the rrab and rrc stars , then the same boundary should show up in the distribution of lightcurve skewness as a function of the @xmath15 color .",
    "as shown in figure  [ rrbox ] ( bottom left panel ) , this is indeed the case . on average ,",
    "sources with @xmath146 have @xmath120 ( symmetric lightcurves ) , as rrc stars , while @xmath145 sources have @xmath122 ( asymmetric lightcurves ) typical of rrab stars .",
    "we show in section  [ rr_eff ] that candidate rr lyrae stars with @xmath152 are contaminated by eclipsing variables . therefore , to reduce the contamination by eclipsing variables , we also require @xmath153 , and select 634 sources as our final sample of candidate rr lyrae stars",
    ".      the selection completeness , defined as the fraction of recovered rr lyrae stars , will depend on the color cuts , @xmath75 cutoff , and the number of observations .",
    "the color cuts ( eqs .  [ color_cuts1 ] to  [ color_cuts2 ] ) applied in section  [ rr_selection ] were chosen to minimize contamination by sources other than rr lyrae stars while maintaining an almost @xmath154 completeness @xcite . with the @xmath75 cutoff at 0.05 mag (",
    "small compared to the @xmath32 mag typical peak - to - peak amplitudes of rr lyrae stars ) , and a fairly large number of observations per source ( median of 10 ) , we estimate the rr lyrae selection completeness to be @xmath76 ( see appendix in @xcite ) .    to determine the selection efficiency , defined as the fraction of true rr lyrae stars in the rr lyrae candidate sample , we positionally match 683 candidate rr lyrae stars selected by @xmath150 to a sample of rr lyrae sources selected from the sdss light - motion - curve catalog ( lmcc ; @xcite ) .",
    "this catalog covers the same region of the sky as the one discussed here , but includes more recent sdss - ii observations that allow the construction of lightcurves .",
    "we match 613 candidates , while 70 candidate rr lyrae stars from our sample , for some reason , do not have a match in the lmcc ( de lee , private communication ) . following the classification based on phased lightcurves by @xcite , we find that @xmath155 of sources in our candidate rr lyrae sample are classified as rrab and rrc , @xmath156 are classified as variable non - rr lyrae stars , and only @xmath157 are spurious , non - variable sources .",
    "the most significant contamination comes from a population of variable sources bluer than @xmath158 ( dotted line , bottom left panel figure  [ rrlyr_box2 ] ) , possibly population ii @xmath159 scuti stars , also known as sx phoenicis stars @xcite .",
    "the top left and the bottom right panels in figure  [ rrlyr_box2 ] , show that rrab and rrc - dominated regions are separated by @xmath144 , as already hinted in figure  [ rrbox ] . also , variable non - rr lyrae sources with @xmath152 are classified by @xcite as eclipsing variables , justifying our @xmath153 cut .    to summarize , using color criteria and criteria based on @xmath89 , @xmath149 , and @xmath54 rr lyrae stars are selected with @xmath76 completeness and @xmath160 efficiency",
    ".      using the selection criteria from section  [ rr_selection ] we isolate 634 rr lyrae candidates . the magnitude - position diagram for these candidates within @xmath161 from the celestial equator",
    "is shown in figure  [ rareq ] .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , an advantage of the data representation utilized in figure  [ rareq ] ( magnitude  right ascension diagram ) is its simplicity  only `` raw '' data are shown , without any post - processing .",
    "however , the magnitude scale is logarithmic and thus the spatial extent of structures is heavily distorted . in order to avoid these shortcomings ,",
    "we have applied a bayesian method for estimating continuous spatial density distribution developed by @xcite ( see their appendix b ) .",
    "the resulting density map is shown in the right panel in figure  [ rrlyr_polarslice ] .",
    "the advantage of that representation is that it better conveys the significance of various local overdensities .",
    "for comparison , we also show a map of the northern part of the equatorial strip constructed using 2-epoch data discussed by @xcite .",
    "we detect several new halo substructures at @xmath162 significance ( compared to expected poissonian fluctuations ) and present their approximate locations and properties in table  [ halo ] .",
    "the most distant clump is at 100 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the strongest clump in the left wedge belongs to the sgr dwarf tidal stream as does the clump marked by @xmath163 in the right wedge @xcite .",
    "we note that the apparent `` clumpiness '' of the candidate rr lyrae distribution increases with increasing radius , similar to cdm predictions by @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of their models with the data presented here will be discussed elsewhere ( sesar et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the optical continuum variability of quasars has been recognized since their first optical identification @xcite , and it has been proposed and utilized as an efficient method for their discovery @xcite .",
    "the observed characteristics of the variability of quasars are frequently used to constrain the origin of their emission ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) . recently",
    ", significant progress in the description of quasar variability has been made by employing the sdss data @xcite .",
    "here we expand these studies by quantifying the efficiency of quasar discovery using variability .",
    "a preliminary comparison of color and variability based methods for selecting quasars using sdss data was presented by @xcite .",
    "they found that @xmath164 of spectroscopically confirmed unresolved quasars with uv excess have the @xmath10 band magnitude difference between two observations obtained two years apart larger than 0.15 mag .",
    "we can improve on their analysis because now there are significantly more observations obtained over a longer time period .",
    "since quasars vary erratically and the rms scatter of their variability ( the so - called structure function ) increases with time ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the variability selection completeness is expected to be higher than @xmath165 obtained by @xcite .    first , although the adopted variability selection criteria discussed above are fairly conservative , we find that at least @xmath94 of low - redshift quasars are variable at the @xmath73 mag level ( simultaneously in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands over observer s time scales of several years ) in the @xmath92 flux - limited sample .",
    "second , even this estimate is only a lower limit : given the spectroscopic confirmation for a large flux - limited sample of quasars , it is possible to relax the adopted variability selection cutoff without a prohibitive contamination by non - variable sources .",
    "there are 2,492 unresolved quasars in the catalog of spectroscopically confirmed sdss quasars @xcite from stripe 82 .",
    "the fraction of these objects that vary more than @xmath55 in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , as a function of @xmath55 , is shown in figure  [ qso_rms ] .",
    "we also show the analogous fraction for stars from the stellar locus . about @xmath166 of quasars",
    "vary with @xmath167 mag . for a small fraction of these objects",
    "the measured rms scatter is due to photometric noise , and the stellar data limit this fraction to be at most @xmath99 . conservatively assuming that none of these @xmath99 of stars is intrinsically variable",
    ", we estimate that _ at least @xmath13 of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level on time scales up to several years_.",
    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) is a proposed imaging survey that aims to obtain repeated multi - band imaging to faint limiting magnitudes over a large fraction of the sky .",
    "the lsst science requirement document calls for @xmath168 repeated observations of a solid angle of @xmath169 deg@xmath3 distributed over the six @xmath170 photometric bandpasses and over 10 years .",
    "the results presented here can be extrapolated to estimate the lower limit on the number of variable sources that the lsst would discover .",
    "the single - epoch lsst images will have a @xmath171 detection limit at @xmath172 .",
    "hence , @xmath8 accurate photometry , comparable to the subsample with @xmath92 discussed here , will be available for stars with @xmath173 .",
    "the usno - b catalog @xcite shows that there are about @xmath174 stars with @xmath175 across the entire sky .",
    "about half of these stars are in the parts of the sky to be surveyed by the lsst .",
    "the simulations based on contemporary milky way models , such as those developed by @xcite and @xcite , predict that there are about twice as many stars with @xmath176 than with @xmath175 across the whole sky .",
    "hence , it is expected that the lsst will detect about a billion stars with @xmath176 .",
    "this estimate is uncertain to within a factor of two or so due to unknown details in the spatial distribution of dust in the galactic plane and towards the galactic center .",
    "we found that at least @xmath14 of stars from the main stellar locus can be detected as variable with photometry accurate to @xmath96 .",
    "this is only a lower limit because a much larger number of lsst observations obtained over a longer timespan than the sdss data discussed here would increase this fraction .",
    "hence , our results imply that _ the lsst will discover at least 50 million variable stars _ ( without accounting for the fact that stellar counts greatly increase closer to the galactic plane ) . unlike the sdss sample , where rr lyrae stars account for @xmath177 of all variable _ stars _ ,",
    "the number of rr lyrae stars in the lsst sample will be negligible compared to other types of variable stars .",
    "as estimated by @xcite using deeper coadded sdss photometry , there are about 100 deg@xmath178 low - redshift quasars with @xmath176 ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . therefore , with a sky coverage of @xmath169 deg@xmath3 , the lsst will obtain well - sampled accurate multi - color lightcurves for @xmath17 million low - redshift quasars . even at the redshift limit of @xmath17 ,",
    "this sample will be complete to @xmath179 , that is , almost to the formal quasar luminosity cutoff , and will represent an unprecedented sample for studying quasar physics .",
    "we have designed and tested algorithms for selecting candidate variable sources from a catalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations . using a sample of 13,051 selected candidate variable sources in the adopted @xmath92 flux - limited sample",
    ", we find that at least @xmath8 of unresolved optical sources appear variable at the @xmath73 mag level , simultaneously in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands .",
    "a similar fraction of variable sources ( @xmath180 ) was also found by @xcite using recalibrated photometric poss and sdss measurements , and by @xcite using the faint sky variability survey data ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "thanks to the multi - color nature of the sdss photometry , and especially to the @xmath35 band data , we can obtain robust classification of selected variable sources .",
    "the majority ( 2/3 ) of variable sources are low - redshift ( @xmath12 ) quasars , although they represent only @xmath8 of all sources in the adopted @xmath92 flux - limited sample .",
    "we find that about 1/4 of variable stars are rr lyrae stars , and that only @xmath14 of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level .",
    "the distribution of @xmath54 for main stellar locus stars is bimodal , suggesting at least two , and perhaps more , different populations of variables . about",
    "a third of variable stars from the stellar locus show gray flux variations in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands ( @xmath107 ) , and positive lightcurve skewness , suggesting variability caused by eclipsing systems .",
    "this population has an increased fraction of m type stars .",
    "rr lyrae stars show the largest rms scatter in the @xmath35 and @xmath10 bands , followed by low - redshift quasars .",
    "the ratio of rms scatter in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands for rr lyrae is @xmath181 , in agreement with @xcite results based on 2-epoch photometry .",
    "the mean lightcurve skewness for rr lyrae stars is @xmath182 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we selected a sample of 634 candidate rr lyrae stars , with an estimated @xmath76 completeness and @xmath160 efficiency . using these stars",
    ", we detected rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc .",
    "the apparent `` clumpiness '' of the candidate rr lyrae distribution increases with increasing radius , similar to cdm predictions by @xcite .",
    "low - redshift quasars show a dependence of @xmath74 on redshift , consistent with discussions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve skewness distribution for quasars is centered on zero in all photometric bands .",
    "we find that at least @xmath13 of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level ( rms ) on time scales up to several years .",
    "this confirms that variability is as a good a method for finding low - redshift quasars at high ( @xmath183 ) galactic latitudes as is the uv excess color selection .",
    "the fraction of variable quasars at the @xmath184 mag level obtained here ( @xmath185 , see figure  [ qso_rms ] ) is comparable to 36% found by @xcite .",
    "the multiple photometric observations obtained by the sdss represent an excellent dataset for estimating the impact of surveys such as the lsst on studies of the variable sky .",
    "our results indicate that the lsst will obtain well - sampled @xmath8 accurate multi - color lightcurves for @xmath17 million low - redshift quasars , and will discover at least 50 million variable stars .",
    "the number of variable stars discovered by the lsst will be of the same order as the number of _ all _ stars detected by the sdss . with about 1000 data points in six photometric bands",
    ", it will be possible to recognize and classify variable objects using lightcurve moments of higher order than skewness discussed here , including lightcurve folding for periodic variables .",

    "<S> we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a catalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog covers sdss stripe 82 , which lies along the celestial equator in the southern galactic hemisphere ( 22h 24 m  @xmath0  04h 08 m , @xmath1 , @xmath2 deg@xmath3 ) , and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss @xmath4 system for 1.4 million unresolved sources that were observed at least 4 times in each of the @xmath5 bands ( with a median of 10 observations obtained over @xmath65 years ) . in each photometric </S>",
    "<S> bandpass we compute various low - order lightcurve statistics such as root - mean - square scatter ( rms ) , @xmath7 per degree of freedom , skewness , minimum and maximum magnitude , and use them to select and study variable sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath8 of unresolved optical sources brighter than @xmath9 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level ( rms ) simultaneously in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the majority ( 2/3 ) of these variable sources are low - redshift ( @xmath12 ) quasars , although they represent only @xmath8 of all sources in the adopted flux - limited sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at least @xmath13 of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level ( rms ) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low - redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection ( at high galactic latitudes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for quasars and find that is centered on zero . </S>",
    "<S> we find that about 1/4 of the variable stars are rr lyrae stars , and that only @xmath14 of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of lightcurve skewness in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 color - color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal ( with one mode consistent with algol - like behavior ) . </S>",
    "<S> using over six hundred rr lyrae stars , we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate these results to expected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate that it will obtain well - sampled @xmath8 accurate , multi - color lightcurves for @xmath17 million low - redshift quasars , and will discover at least 50 million variable stars . </S>"
