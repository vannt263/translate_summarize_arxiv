    "the experiments in the multi - color non - collinear geometry ( fig.[fig1]b(i , ii ) ) were carried out in a typical cars setup which consists of a commercial ti - sapphire regenerative amplifier ( spitfire , spectra - physics , 1 khz repetition rate , 10 nm spectral bandwidth ( fwhm ) , 2 mj output pulse power ) generating the probe pulses at the central wavelength of 800 nm , and an optical parametric amplifier ( topas , light conversion ) generating the pump and stokes pulses at 1111 nm and 1250 nm , respectively .",
    "all three pulses of @xmath3510 @xmath39j energy each were focused by a lens ( focal length of 500 mm ) into a quartz cuvette ( 5 mm optical path ) with the liquid sample , where they overlapped in time and in space ( boxcars phase - matching geometry ) .",
    "the output anti - stokes beam was collimated with a 150 mm focal - length lens and coupled into the spectrometer ( model 2035 , mcpherson ) equipped with a ccd camera ( idus dv400 , andor ) and providing a spectral resolution of @xmath40 @xmath31 .    in the first configuration ( fig.[fig1]b(i ) ) , we introduced white noise in the probe pulses using the programmable spectral pulse shaper based on a dual - mask 128-pixel liquid - crystal spatial light modulator ( slm-128 , cri ) .",
    "the resolving power of the shaper was @xmath353.5 @xmath31 per pixel , which dictated the smallest frequency correlation length of the applied noise , and therefore determined the resolution of the nascars signal . from studying the effects of the phase and amplitude noise independently ,",
    "we conclude that the phase noise results in superior nascars performance .",
    "in contrast to the amplitude noise , it does not attenuate the available probe pulse energy and results in a much smaller temporal overlap of the probe train with the pump - stokes pulse pair , reducing the non - resonant background and increasing the signal quality .",
    "we also demonstrated one simple way of phase scrambling by replacing the pulse shaper with a 3 meter - long piece of standard multi - mode fibre of 64 @xmath39 m core diameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b(ii ) ) .",
    "a probe pulse , coupled into the multiple fibre modes , breaks apart into an incoherent pulse train due to the intermodal dispersion .",
    "the large number of available modes and the high sensitivity of the dispersion of each mode to local mechanical stresses in the fibre , enables an easy and efficient way of statistical averaging over the realizations of noise .",
    "new realizations of a random probe train are generated by simply moving the fibre between the consecutive data acquisitions .",
    "matching the temporal duration of the output random train to the decay time of the vibrational coherence by choosing an optimal fibre length assures high spectral resolution of the nascars measurement .    for the single - pulse experiments we used ultrashort pulses of higher bandwidth from a different femtosecond ti : sapphire regenerative amplifier system ( spitfire pro , spectra - physics , 1 khz repetition rate , 35 nm spectral bandwidth ( fwhm ) , 3 mj output pulse power ) .",
    "the wavelength of the amplified pulses was centered at 805 nm .",
    "the beam was apertured down to a diameter of 0.5 mm before entering the compressor stage of spitfire pro .",
    "a thin sheet of a light scattering material ( optical cleaning tissue , thorlabs ) was fixed on a rigid frame and mounted on a one - dimensional translation stage inside the compressor ( fig.[fig1]b(iii ) ) .",
    "the scatterer was placed after the second reflection from the diffraction grating , i.e. at the location where all spectral components of the pulse are parallel and spatially separated .",
    "different noise realizations in this single - pulse configuration were achieved by moving the scattering sheet perpendicular to the dispersed beam .",
    "the energy of the output beam was 10 @xmath39j .",
    "the laser beam was focused into a quartz cuvette with a liquid sample ( 5 mm optical path ) by a spherical mirror with 300 mm focal length .",
    "the transmitted laser beam was collimated with a lens ( 150 mm focal length ) and coupled into the spectrometer ( model 2035 , mcpherson ) equipped with a ccd camera ( idus dv400 , andor ) .",
    "the resolving power of the spectrometer in this case was 1.3 @xmath31 .",
    "two frequency filters were employed for enhancing the sensitivity of the detection . a long - wave pass filter ( lp02 - 785ru-25 , semrock )",
    "was used to block the high frequency components of the beam in front of the sample , while a short wave pass filter ( sp01 - 785ru-25 , semrock ) in front of the spectrometer prevented it from being saturated by the strong incident pump pulse .    in all our experiments ,",
    "each measured anti - stokes spectrum corresponded to a different noise realization .",
    "after normalization , each two consecutive spectra were subtracted from one another and an auto - correlation of the differential spectrum represented the result of a single nascars measurement .",
    "the statistical averaging of the auto - correlation was performed over 100 noise realizations ."
