    "<S> an infalling shell in the hard wall model provides a simple holographic model for energy injection in a confining gauge theory . depending on its parameters , a scalar shell either collapses into a large black brane , or scatters between the hard wall and the anti - de sitter boundary . in the scattering regime </S>",
    "<S> , we find numerical solutions that keep oscillating for as long as we have followed their evolution , and we provide an analytic argument that shows that a black brane can never be formed . </S>",
    "<S> this provides examples of states in infinite - volume field theory that never thermalize . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the field theory expectation value of a scalar operator keeps oscillating , with an amplitude that undergoes modulation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ experimental results on ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions suggest a fast transition from an initial far - from - equilibrium state to a quark gluon plasma well - described by near - ideal hydrodynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since small viscosity implies strong coupling , this has motivated the use of gauge / gravity duality to study thermalization ( or the approach to hydrodynamics ) of certain conformal field theories ( cfts ) after a sudden injection of energy @xcite . under the duality , </S>",
    "<S> thermalization in the field theory corresponds to black brane formation in the dual bulk theory . </S>",
    "<S> an encouraging result is that many such `` holographic '' models indeed give rise to thermalization times that , when extrapolated to real heavy ion collisions , are short enough to comfortably accommodate the experimental results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another remarkable feature is that in the simplest holographic models , the short - wavelength modes thermalize first @xcite .    in @xcite , the study of gravitational infall in the simplest _ confining _ holographic model , namely the hard wall model , was initiated . </S>",
    "<S> perturbative techniques adapted from @xcite showed that for sufficiently fast injection of homogeneous energy density , a black brane is formed in the bulk , but that there also exists a regime in which an infalling shell scatters from the hard wall , and then again from the boundary , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the intuition is that a black brane is formed if the black brane that would be formed in ordinary anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime ( without a hard wall ) has its event horizon outside the hard wall . </S>",
    "<S> ( otherwise the infalling shell is scattered back by the hard wall before it reaches its schwarzschild radius . ) </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative techniques used in @xcite did not allow a reliable study of the long - time evolution of the scattering solutions . neither did they enable a quantitative study of the transition between both regimes . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question left unanswered in @xcite is what the scattering solution corresponds to from a field theory perspective . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the scattering solutions never collapse , corresponding to field theory states that never thermalize .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is related to recent studies , initiated in @xcite , of whether a spherical shell in anti - de sitter space will collapse into a small black hole . the picture that has emerged is that depending on the details of the shell , a black hole may be formed ( possibly after scattering from the boundary a number of times ) or the shell may keep scattering for as long as one can compute the evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this matches well with intricate thermalization behavior of finite volume systems ( for solutions that eventually collapse , this was recently discussed in @xcite ) . in our work </S>",
    "<S> , we are dealing with infinite volume systems , whose thermalization behavior is usually expected to be simpler ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    _ </S>",

    "<S> , we will mainly consider two possible boundary conditions on the scalar field : dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath19 , corresponding to @xmath20 , or neumann boundary conditions @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> for the numerical analysis we use the rescaling freedom of the coordinates @xmath23 to set @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore time @xmath12 and the injection time @xmath25 appearing in the plots are given in units of @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> _ the most noteworthy feature of our results is the oscillating behavior of @xmath75 in the scattering phase . </S>",
    "<S> if this behavior persists for all times , it indicates that the out - of - equilibrium state created by the energy injection never thermalizes . </S>",
    "<S> while analogous solutions have been found before for field theories in finite volume ( dual to asymptotically global ads spacetimes ) , to our knowledge this would be the first such example in infinite volume . we have therefore investigated the behavior of @xmath75 in our scattering solutions for much later times than those displayed in figure  [ evol ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ longtime ] shows , for @xmath37 and neumann boundary conditions , that the oscillations continue for as long as we have followed the evolution , but that they are modulated on a larger timescale . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results indicate that this timescale decreases with @xmath27 , roughly like @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this scaling is due to the above - mentioned secular terms in weakly non - linear perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> for other dimensions and for other boundary conditions , for which there are no secular terms in perturbation theory , we find a less pronounced modulation .     </S>",
    "<S> long - time evolution of @xmath75 in the scattering phase for @xmath37 , @xmath32 , @xmath89 and neumann boundary conditions . ]    in fact , a simple analytic argument shows that the scattering solutions can never evolve into a black brane solution . </S>",
    "<S> first , since they do not have enough energy to form a large black brane ( with horizon in the physical part of spacetime ) , the only possibility would be a small black brane ( with would - be horizon behind the hard wall ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , ( [ fd ] ) implies that @xmath30 is constant at the hard wall , so @xmath8 if we start from empty ads . </S>",
    "<S> since small black brane solutions have @xmath90 at the hard wall , they can not be formed . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion would still hold if at the hard wall we allowed more general boundary conditions @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is an arbitrary function </S>",
    "<S> . these boundary conditions can be imposed in agreement with the variational principle if we add to the bulk action a boundary term at the hard wall proportional to @xmath94 . in that case ( [ fd ] ) implies that at the hard wall location , @xmath95 , with constant @xmath46 . again </S>",
    "<S> , if initially we have @xmath8 and @xmath96 , then at late times we can not have @xmath90 and @xmath96 , as would have been the case for a small black brane . </S>",
    "<S> while for these more general boundary conditions we can not exclude that the system might approach another static solution than a black brane , we have seen no hints of this in our numerical solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question is what is the energy density of the final state as a function of the source amplitude @xmath27 and the injection time @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ t_eps ] shows that for fixed @xmath25 , the injected energy increases as a function of @xmath27 . while for small @xmath25 the increase is gradual , for large @xmath25 the injected energy density is very small in the scattering phase ( as can be expected for a source that is turned on and off almost adiabatically ) , but increases very sharply when the threshold for black brane formation is crossed . ( in the latter regime , we have discussed before that the adiabatic approximation breaks down . )     </S>",
    "<S> total injected energy as a function of @xmath27 for @xmath37 and neumann boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the black stars mark the critical value for black hole formation . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering regime is on the left of these markers and the black brane formation regime is on the right . ]    _ possible implications for qcd . </S>",
    "<S> _ while the hard wall model is only a crude model for qcd , it is tempting to speculate on what our results might mean when extrapolated to real qcd . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if we took the scalar field @xmath1 to be the dilaton , the source @xmath61 would couple to the operator @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently fast injection , the system thermalizes into a deconfined plasma , and @xmath98 ( as could be expected based on equipartition between electric and magnetic gluon polarizations ) . for sufficiently slow injection , </S>",
    "<S> the degrees of freedom remain confined . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations in @xmath99 can be interpreted in terms of convertions of a collection of glueballs into another collection ( and back ) .    </S>",
