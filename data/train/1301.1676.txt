    "in a recent paper jentschura et al@xcite discussed the resonances for the anharmonic oscillator @xmath0and their weak- and strong - coupling expansions .",
    "they showed analytical expressions for the coefficients of the former and numerical estimates for those of the latter .",
    "in particular , the leading coefficients of the strong - coupling expansions are the eigenvalues of @xmath1 .    some time earlier bender and boettcher@xcite had discussed the eigenvalues of pt - symmetric oscillators of the form @xmath2 that exhibit a finite number of real positive eigenvalues for @xmath3 and an infinite number when @xmath4 .",
    "alvarez@xcite discussed the analytical properties of the solutions of the hamiltonian operator @xmath5 and showed that it supports real and complex resonances depending on the complex values of the coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "his results suggest that the resonances calculated by jentschura et al@xcite and the real eigenvalues obtained by boettcher and bender@xcite ( see also bender@xcite ) may by related in a simple way by means of the symanzik scaling@xcite already invoked by alvarez is his investigation@xcite . in exactly the same way the strong - coupling expansion obtained by jentschura et al@xcite may be related to",
    "that obtained some time earlier by fernndez et al@xcite for the pt - symmetric oscillator @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the exploration into such relationships as well as into other properties of a class of nonhermitian oscillators .    in section  [ sec : eigenvalues ] we investigate the relationship among some of the earlier results on one - dimensional nonhermitian oscillators . in section  [ sec :",
    "rpm ] we discuss the application of the complex - rotation@xcite and riccati - pad@xcite methods to those oscillators .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results and draw conclusions .",
    "as outlined above , jentschura et al@xcite discussed several properties of the resonances for the anharmonic oscillator @xmath8 as well as their weak - coupling @xmath9 and strong - coupling expansions @xmath10 the coefficients of the former can be obtained exactly by means of perturbation theory and those of the latter in a numerical way . in particular , the leading coefficients of the strong - coupling expansions @xmath11 are the eigenvalues of the pure cubic anharmonic oscillator @xmath12    on the other hand , the closely related pt - symmetric oscillators @xmath13 exhibit an infinite number of real positive eigenvalues when @xmath4@xcite and accurate results for @xmath14 and @xmath15 are available for comparison@xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain a connection between the results outlined above by means of the symanzik scaling @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a well known unitary operator@xcite .",
    "this transformation was already used by alvarez in his investigation of the cubic anharmonic oscillator@xcite .",
    "for example , if we take into account that @xmath18 when @xmath19 then we realize that the complex eigenvalues @xmath11 of @xmath20 calculated by jentschura et al@xcite and the real positive eigenvalues @xmath21 of @xmath22 for @xmath14 calculated by boettcher and bender@xcite and bender@xcite are related by @xmath23    some time ago fernndez et al@xcite obtained the perturbation expansion for the pt - symmetric oscillator @xmath24 in the form @xmath25 arguing as before , we can obtain the coefficients of the strong - coupling expansion ( [ eq : series_strong ] ) from those of the perturbation series ( [ eq : series_lambda ] ) as follows : @xmath26 the first coefficients are shown in table  [ tab : strongser ] as an illustrative example .",
    "for concreteness we consider the family of anharmonic oscillators @xmath27 the complex - rotation method ( crm ) consists of the diagonalization of the rotated hamiltonian operator @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 produces a dilatation or contraction of the scale and @xmath31 a rotation of the coordinate in the complex @xmath32-plane . on tuning @xmath33",
    "we improve the rate of convergence of the diagonalization method as the matrix dimension increases and the value of @xmath34 enables us to uncover the resonances@xcite . for the diagonalization method",
    "we choose the basis set of eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator @xmath35 .    for comparison purposes we also apply the riccati - pad method ( rpm ) for asymmetric potentials@xcite .",
    "it consists of the expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the eigenfunction @xmath36@xmath37 in a taylor series about the origin @xmath38 where the coefficients @xmath39 depend on the two unknowns @xmath40 and @xmath41 . from the coefficients of the even and odd powers of the coordinate @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , respectively , we construct the hankel determinants @xmath45 , @xmath46 and obtain both @xmath40 and @xmath47 from the roots of the system of nonlinear equations @xmath48 .",
    "for every fixed value of @xmath49 we look for convergent sequences of roots @xmath50}$ ] , @xmath51 .",
    "commonly , we obtain reasonable results for @xmath52 but calculations with other values of @xmath53 enable us to test the consistency of the method .    since the rate of convergence of the rpm is considerably greater than the one for the crm we choose the results of the former as exact or reference eigenvalues .",
    "figure  [ fig : loger ] shows @xmath54 as a function of @xmath31 for the first resonances of the cubic oscillator ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "those results suggest that the minimum of the logarithmic deviation appears at @xmath56 ( in all our calculations we have chosen @xmath57 that provides a reasonable rate of convergence ) . in order to understand this empirical result",
    "we resort to the scaling transformation ( [ eq : u+h_ku ] ) for @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath59 $ ] is proportional to the pt - symmetric oscillator @xmath60 when @xmath61}$ ] , @xmath62 . for @xmath55 and @xmath63",
    "we obtain @xmath56 as suggested by figure  [ fig : loger ] .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that the optimal rotation angle converts each of the anharmonic oscillators of this particular class into a pt - symmetric one .",
    "it also follows from equation ( [ eq : u+h_ku ] ) that @xmath64 when @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , instead of just one eigenvalue @xmath66 we expect @xmath67 replicas located at @xmath68 the rpm yields all these eigenvalues simultaneously as limits of different sequences of roots of the same sequence of pairs of hankel determinants . on the other hand ,",
    "the crm uncovers them at different values of @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ fig : loger2 ] shows @xmath69 as a function of @xmath31 for the lowest resonance of the cubic oscillator .",
    "we appreciate that the closest agreement between both methods takes place exactly at the rotation angles @xmath70 derived above .",
    "table  [ tab : e0j ] shows these results more precisely and table  [ tab : e0j_k5 ] a similar calculation for the quintic oscillator .",
    "the case @xmath63 for the cubic oscillator agrees with the resonance calculated by jentschura et al@xcite . these authors claimed to have chosen the rotation angle @xmath71 for all their calculations on the cubic oscillator ( in particular for the strong - coupling expansion ) .",
    "however , we could not obtain acceptable results for this rotation angle .",
    "in fact , our calculations for the cubic oscillator suggest that the multiples of @xmath71 are the worst choices .",
    "figure  [ fig : rr - k3 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the first resonance as functions of @xmath31 .",
    "we appreciate that the regions of stability appear at @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( the boundaries are marked by vertical dashed lines ) .",
    "the optimal rotation angles discussed above ( those that convert the anharmonic oscillator into a pt - symmetric one ) bisect each of these regions and the rotation angle chosen by jentschura et al corresponds to one of the boundaries .",
    "present results agree with those of alvarez@xcite who proposed to integrate the differential equation along the rays @xmath74 in the case of a harmonic oscillator perturbed by the cubic term @xmath75 .",
    "more precisely , he also showed that the left and right boundary conditions for the resonances hold in the common sector @xmath76 so that @xmath77 for @xmath78 in agreement with the first region of stability shown in figure  [ fig : rr - k3 ] .",
    "the appearance of the optimal rotation angle @xmath71 in the paper by jentschura et al@xcite is merely due to a misprint@xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : enk3k5 ] shows the first resonances for the cubic and quintic oscillators calculated by means of the rpm",
    ". they may be useful as benchmark for testing other approximate methods .",
    "for example , the first three of them for @xmath55 agree with those of jentschura et al@xcite .    from the results",
    "just discussed one may be tempted to conclude that the cmr with @xmath79 should yield the eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric oscillators .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the convergence of this method towards the accurate rpm eigenvalues shown in table  [ tab : rr_ixn ] . however , such conclusion is wrong .",
    "although the eigenvalues produced by two quite different methods like the rpm and crm agree accurately for all @xmath80 only in the case @xmath14 they are those of the pt - symmetric oscillators . for @xmath81",
    "both methods yield the resonances discussed above rotated in the complex plane . in fact ,",
    "bender and boettcher@xcite clearly stated that the diagonalization method is useful only for @xmath82 because in the other cases the wedges in which the eigenfunction vanishes as @xmath83 do not contain the real @xmath32 axis .",
    "more precisely , since those wedges are not symmetric about the origin the complex rotation outlined above is insufficient to take into account both the left and right pt boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : compa_ixn ] shows the first eigenvalues for the pt - symmetric oscillators ( [ eq : h_pt ] ) with @xmath84 and @xmath85 calculated by means of the rpm , crm ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) and wkb method .",
    "the first two approaches agree between them but not with the wkb method that provides estimates to the actual eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric oscillators@xcite .",
    "note that the discrepancy increases with the quantum number that makes the wkb increasingly accurate .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian matrix agree with the wkb ones for the @xmath14 case@xcite . as an additional confirmation that the eigenvalues of the crm are not those of the pt - symmetric oscillators compare the results of table  [ tab : compa_ixn ] with the accurate upper and lower bounds derived by yan and handy@xcite .",
    "although the functional form of the operators is the same the boundary conditions are different@xcite . for simplicity , from now we will refer to resonance@xcite and pt - symmetric boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "although the crm takes into account only the former , it is interesting that it yields real positive eigenvalues for the pt - symmetric oscillators ( [ eq : h_pt ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "the reason is discussed below .    in order to understand the results",
    "just outlined we inspect the form of the eigenfunctions provided by the crm for the pt - symmetric oscillators .",
    "we calculated the eigenfunctions @xmath88 , @xmath89 and their absolute squares are shown in figure  [ fig : psi_pt ] for @xmath90 .",
    "we appreciate that they all look similar and satisfy @xmath91as expected from the fact that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "even though the resonance boundary conditions are different from the pt - symmetric ones for @xmath81 there appears to be an unbroken symmetry that produces real eigenvalues . besides , all those eigenfunctions are strongly localized about @xmath94 as expected for a resonance .",
    "it is interesting that both the rpm and the crm yield real and positive eigenvalues with localized eigenfunctions for the pt - symmetric oscillators although they are not the true eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the pt - symmetric oscillators for @xmath95 .    in addition to the resonances just discussed the rpm also yields the true eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric oscillators for all @xmath96 .",
    "for example , for @xmath84 we estimated @xmath97 from determinants of dimension @xmath98 .",
    "note that this eigenvalue is considerably greater than that in table  [ tab : compa_ixn ] obtained from the resonance boundary condition .",
    "we will discuss this issue again below .",
    "the situation is remarkably different for @xmath99 .",
    "the pt - symmetric oscillators require asymmetric boundary conditions@xcite and , consequently , one should apply the rpm for asymmetric potentials outlined above .",
    "however , in the case of resonances the boundary conditions are symmetric ( for example , outgoing waves to the right and left ) and the oscillator exhibits true even parity . in this case",
    "the appropriate logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction is of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 or @xmath102 for even or odd eigenfunctions , respectively . from the coefficients of the taylor expansion @xmath103 we construct the hankel determinants @xmath104 that depend on the only unknown @xmath40 and",
    "obtain the eigenvalues from sequences of roots of @xmath105@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we can apply the crm exactly in the same way discussed above .",
    "in this case the optimal rotation angles are given by @xmath106 , @xmath62 that make @xmath107 proportional to the hermitian operator @xmath108 .",
    "table  [ tab : e0j_k4 ] compares the crm and rpm results for the first resonance of the quartic oscillator ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "there are @xmath110 replicas of every resonance given by @xmath111    in this case the rpm for asymmetric potentials yields the eigenvalues of the corresponding pt - symmetric oscillator .",
    "table  [ tab : en_n4_n5 ] shows the first three eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric oscillators ( [ eq : h_pt ] ) with @xmath15 and @xmath84 .",
    "the results in the first column agree with those obtained earlier by means of numerical integration@xcite and those in the second column lie within the upper and lower bounds derived by yan and handy@xcite .",
    "the rate of convergence of the rpm is considerably greater for @xmath15 ; in addition to it , we experienced considerable numerical difficulties in obtaining the roots of the pair of hankel determinants for @xmath84 by means of the newton - raphson method .",
    "in section  [ sec : eigenvalues ] we have shown that a simple scaling argument enables one to connect the results obtained earlier by several authors for a class of nonhermitian oscillators .",
    "although this relationship is contained in alvarez s work@xcite the actual connection formulas have not been made explicit as far as we know .",
    "for example , the resonances of the cubic oscillator are straightforwardly related to the eigenvalues of the corresponding pt - symmetric oscillator .",
    "such connection is not possible for other oscillators because the boundary conditions that give rise to the resonances and pt - symmetric eigenvalues are different .",
    "the comparison of the rpm and crm results enabled us to obtain the optimal rotation angle for the latter approach .",
    "we have shown that the effect of the optimal coordinate rotation is to convert the nonhermitian oscillators ( [ eq : h_k ] ) into either a pt - symmetric or hermitian one , for @xmath112 odd or even , respectively .",
    "such results are consistent with alvarez s analysis of the harmonic oscillator with a cubic perturbation@xcite .",
    "we have also shown that both the rpm and crm yield real positive eigenvalues for the pt - symmetric oscillators ( [ eq : h_pt ] ) with @xmath113 but those results are not the actual eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric oscillators when @xmath95 because the resonance and pt - symmetric boundary conditions are different .",
    "the crm eigenfunctions are strongly localized and their absolute squares exhibit the symmetry coming from unbroken symmetry .",
    "it is also interesting that the eigenfunctions for the case @xmath14 ( where the crm yields the actual eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric oscillator ) are similar to those of @xmath114 ( where the boundary conditions are those for the resonances ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rpm yields both the real positive resonances mentioned above for odd @xmath115 as well as the actual pt - symmetric eigenvalues obtained by bender and boettcher@xcite and bender@xcite . in the case of @xmath113 all the eigenvalues are limits of sequences of roots of the same hankel determinants given by the rpm for nonsymmetric potentials . in the case of even - parity potentials @xmath116 the rpm for even parity potentials",
    "yields the resonances and the approach for nonsymmetric potentials provides the eigenvalues of the corresponding pt - symmetric oscillators .",
    "the main disadvantage of this approach as a practical tool is that it provides results for so many different problems that it is sometimes difficult to pick up the correct sequence of roots of the system of two hankel determinants necessary for the treatment of nonsymmetric problems . on the other hand , from a mathematical point of view ,",
    "this property of the rpm is most intriguing and interesting .",
