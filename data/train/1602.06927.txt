    "we have explored two methods of overcoming this challenge .",
    "the first method is background subtraction .",
    "the background can be determined from a select number of off - axis detectors or from observations of the same region slightly offset from the target .",
    "the effect of emission from the local background in which cores would be found was recognized in preparing the `` evolution of interstellar dust '' key program under the ism specialist astronomy group ( sag4 , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result the proposal included three observations for each of the starless cores , two of which were pointed slightly away from the source as discussed in section  [ sec : specobs ] and figure  [ fig : spirefootprints ] .",

    "spectra for the other detectors will be discussed in a subsequent paper focused on the spatial variation of dust parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : ext_allcores ] shows that subtracting a background corrects for the differences in slope in the overlap region between slw and ssw spectra .",
    "fitting a grey body function to the resultant sed for l1689b results in a lower temperature than that from fitting the uncorrected sed .",
    "this is a clear indication that spectra measured by the spire fts beam consist of emission from both a hot extended foreground or background and a cold core .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that the centres of these self - gravitating cores are cold while the outer regions , which are heated by an external radiation field , are warmer .",
    "if the emission from the warmer dust in the outer layers is not removed from the measured data , the derived core masses will be biased towards lower values @xcite .",
    "fitting to the l1521e sed  a more extended core  before and after background subtraction results in almost the same temperatures and dust emissivity indices implying that the background is a less important contributor to the measured flux .",
    "the relative importance of background flux can be seen by examining the spectra in figure 5 : for l1521e , the background contributes @xmath010% of the total brightness ( figure 5a vs. 5b ) , whereas the background contribution is @xmath030% for l1689b ( figure 5c vs. 5d )",
    ".    for comparison purposes , figure  [ fig : ext_allcores ] also shows flux densities of the cores derived from extended - source calibrated spire and the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) photometer maps using circular apertures having the same size as the fts beam at the corresponding wavelengths for the on - source and off - source positions .",
    "the photometer data shown in figure  [ fig : ext_allcores ] represent the mean of the colour corrected flux densities of all map pixels in the circular apertures used . as mentioned previously , the error bars include contributions from the statistical analysis and calibration uncertainties . an equivalent background subtraction method as that used for the fts spectra has also been applied to the photometer data and the resultant seds fitted with grey body functions .",
    "it can be seen that the brightnesses measured by the spire and pacs photometers are consistent with those from the fts , yielding consistent temperatures and dust emissivity indices especially for background subtracted seds .",
    "the derived parameters from fitting a grey body to the fts spectra are based upon 45 independent spectral points whereas the fit to the photometer data is based upon four points . as a result fts spectra",
    "provide a better constraint to grey body fitting .",
    "a similar exercise carried out on spectra from l1521f showed that background subtraction alone can not correct for the gap in the overlap region between slw and ssw spectra .",
    "extended source calibration appears to be overcorrecting the spectra for this source and so l1521f is not as extended as the other two cores .",
    "a second method for correcting the gap in the overlap region between slw and ssw spectra is to use the `` semiextendedcorrector '' tool ( sect ) as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the tool corrects sparse sampled point - source calibrated spectra using the measured beam profile @xcite and an image of the source distribution .",
    "the spectrum is corrected to a default reference beam of 40 . in the case of l1521f",
    ", the spectra were corrected to a reference beam equal to the source size derived from sect .",
    "sect applies a correction for the forward coupling efficiency , but does not correct for effects such as the efficiency with which the reconstructed beam shape couples to the source , the deviation of the model from the true source distribution , and the response far from the axis @xcite .",
    "the tool is therefore limited to sources that are not extended .",
    "for this reason , sect was only used to correct spectra for l1521f .",
    "figure  [ fig : point_sect_allcores ] shows the results from applying the sect tool to point - source calibrated and background subtracted spectra for l1521f and fitting grey body functions to extract the dust temperature and emissivity index .",
    "figure  [ fig : point_sect_allcores ] also shows colour corrected flux densities of the core derived from point - source calibrated spire and pacs photometer maps .",
    "we used circular apertures derived by assuming that the measured map for l1521f is a convolution of a gaussian source profile and the instrumental beam profile at the corresponding wavelengths for the on - source and off - source positions .",
    "the error bars are as described above .",
    "the source sizes required to eliminate the gap in the overlap region using sect for the background subtracted spectra are 61 , 29.5  and 39  which corresponds to 0.041 , 0.019 and 0.023 pc for l1521e , l1521f and l1689b , respectively ( the latest sect updates do not allow determination of source sizes for sources larger than 60  since these are considered extended ) .",
    "these source sizes are in remarkable agreement with 0.031 pc derived by @xcite for l1521e and 0.015 and 0.024 pc derived by @xcite for l1521f and l1689b , respectively .",
    "the smallest source sizes for l1521e , l1521f and l1689b estimated from the photometer maps using the 50 % contour are @xmath080 , @xmath035  and @xmath0120  respectively .",
    "it is clear that source sizes for l1521e , l1521f derived from the spire fts spectra and photometer maps are in agreement while those for l1689b are not . l1689b appears larger than the other two cores on the photometer maps most likely due to the more extended foreground / background .",

    "is based on spectra corrected only for background emission ( figure  [ fig : ext_allcores ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) while for l1521f we use the spectrum corrected for background emission and for source extent by sect ( figure  [ fig : point_sect_allcores ] ( b ) ) . since the intermediate positions are closer to the on - source positions the possibility exists for the intermediate position to be contaminated by emission from the core itself .",
    "for this reason we have chosen the off - source position when performing the background subtraction . however , we find that using spectra from either the intermediate or off - source positions for the background subtraction produces consistent results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "once corrected for effects of source spatial extent , the spire fts and spire / pacs photometer seds were separately fitted using equation  [ eqn:1 ] to derive @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in fitting the grey body function to our data we used the mpfit function which employs the levenberg - marquardt technique to solve least square problems @xcite .",
