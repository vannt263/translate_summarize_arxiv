    "of all the environments explored locally , the dense , concentrated cores of rich clusters are highly conspicuous for their lack of star - forming galaxies . thus it came as a surprise when butcher & oemler ( 1978 ; see also butcher & oemler 1984 ) discovered a population of blue , possibly star - forming , galaxies in the cores of rich clusters at @xmath1 .",
    "subsequent low and intermediate resolution spectroscopy of these galaxies has confirmed they are cluster members and also that star formation is the cause of their blue colors ( dressler & gunn 1982 , 1983 , 1992 ; lavery & henry 1986 , 1988 ; couch & sharples 1987 , cs87 ; henry & lavery 1987 ; soucail et al .",
    "1988 ; fabricant et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ; couch et al .  1994 , 1998 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; fisher et al .",
    "1998 ) .    while the variation in the blue population within rich clusters shows evidence for dramatic evolutionary effects , additional signs of change",
    "were also uncovered by the spectroscopic studies .",
    "these included a class of galaxies , first identified by dressler & gunn ( 1983 ) , with no detectable emission lines ( and hence little or no on - going star formation ) but very strong balmer absorption .",
    "dressler & gunn inferred the presence of a substantial population of a stars and concluded that an epoch of strong star formation had abruptly ended in the recent past , leaving the galaxy in a so  called ` post - starburst ' phase . in 1987 couch & sharples",
    "made the first attempt to synthesise a coherent view of the star formation histories of these and the other spectral populations within the clusters , hoping to identify a single evolutionary cycle through a starburst phase to the post - starburst galaxies and from there into the large population of passive galaxies seen in the clusters ( see also barger et al .",
    ". however , the nature of the physical process(es ) responsible for triggering and terminating the episodes of star formation in the distant clusters ( and the lack of such activity today ) has remained elusive .",
    "the next major step came from high resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . using pre- and post - refurbishment imaging , the populations of star - forming and post - starburst galaxies were morphological identified with disk - dominated systems , a fraction",
    "of which are interacting or obviously disturbed ( couch et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; dressler et al .  1994 ;",
    "oemler et al .",
    "this supported the suggestion of galaxy - galaxy interactions as one triggering mechanism for the star formation seen in the distant clusters ( lavery & henry 1988 ) .",
    "however , the expectation that the high - speed encounters within clusters would be ineffective at disturbing galaxies has led to other dynamical mechanisms being suggested , including tidal disruption ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ) and repeated high  speed encounters in the cluster potential ( ` harassment ' , moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "interactions with the intracluster medium ( icm ) have also remained a popular explanation of some of the properties of the butcher - oemler population ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging of distant clusters also turned up evidence for evolution in the passive cluster galaxies .",
    "the population of luminous cluster ellipticals appear to have been in place in the clusters since at least @xmath2 ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ) and the homogeneity of their properties would argue that they underwent the bulk of their star formation prior to @xmath3 ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; van dokkum & franx 1996 ; ellis et al .  1997 ;",
    "barger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , the s0 galaxies which dominate the cores of rich clusters today are noticeably absent from these environments at @xmath4 ( dressler et al .",
    "the recent formation or transformation of the cluster s0 galaxies and the connections to the evolutionary history of the butcher - oemler population are of considerable interest for understanding the extent of environmental influences on galaxy morphology and stellar populations .    to elucidate the physical processes which are driving the star formation activity and the morphological transformations in these distant clusters , we have been conducting a large space- and ground - based study of 10 rich clusters in the range @xmath5 .",
    "one of the main aims of this study  known as the ` morphs ' collaboration  has been to obtain detailed morphologies of magnitude - limited samples of galaxies in these clusters from high resolution images taken with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) onboard the _",
    "hst_. these data have already been presented and discussed in a series of papers ( smail et al .",
    "1997a , b ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; dressler et al .  1997 ; barger et al .",
    "1998 ) .    another important component of our program has been to obtain extensive ground - based spectroscopy within the fields of these clusters in order to better quantify the star formation activity of the cluster galaxies , particularly those for which _ hst _ morphologies are available . in dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter d99 ) , we presented spectra for 657 galaxies observed across the fields of our 10 clusters , 424 of which were confirmed to be cluster members .",
    "detailed morphological and photometric information from the _ hst _ images ( smail et al .",
    "1997b , s97 ) is available for 204 cluster members and 71 field galaxies and has been included in the d99 tables .",
    "this dataset is suitable to study simultaneously the spectral and the morphological properties of galaxies in distant clusters and it allows a direct comparison between the high redshift field and cluster populations .",
    "the main results of d99 can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) the ` post - starburst ' ( k+a / a+k ) galaxies are a significant fraction , @xmath6% , of the cluster population , while their incidence in the field at similar redshifts is considerably lower . moreover ,",
    "the frequency of k+a / a+k s in clusters is much higher at @xmath00.5 than at low redshift , and apparently evolves more strongly with redshift than in the field population .",
    "while the galaxies in this class include examples of all hubble types , the majority of them show disk dominated morphologies .",
    "\\2 ) at a given hubble type , the cluster galaxies show a higher frequency of spectra with low or no detectable [ oii ] emission compared to the surrounding field ( including examples of late - type spirals with no current star formation ) .",
    "this indicates a general reduction in the star formation activity of galaxies in the clusters , as measured by the ew([oii ] ) , compared to the field .",
    "\\3 ) those galaxies which are currently forming stars ( all the spectral classes with emission lines ) have both a more extended spatial distribution and a higher velocity dispersion than the galaxies with passive ( k  type ) spectra . the recently star forming k+a / a+k galaxies exhibit spatial and kinematic distributions intermediate between the passive and active populations .",
    "dressler et al .  ( 1999 ) interpret the kinematic and evolutionary behaviour of the post - starburst galaxies as clear evidence for the environment being responsible for the formation or visibility of the k+a / a+k classes .",
    "d99 gave a qualitative discussion of the properties of the cluster galaxies and laid the ground - work for the quantitative analysis undertaken in this work .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to model and interpret the different spectroscopic classes in d99 in order to identify the star formation patterns that are present in cluster galaxies at these earlier epochs and thus predict their likely subsequent ( and also previous ) spectrophotometric evolution .",
    "this information is vital to detailing and therefore understanding the physical processes responsible for the changes in luminosity , color and morphology that underlie the ` butcher  oemler ' effect .",
    "it is worth stressing that , although the existence of a strong evolution between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is well established , a dataset equivalent to the one presented in d99 does not exist for low redshift clusters and this of course limits the comparison with the present epoch .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 we describe the different spectroscopic classes found in the distant clusters and examine the possible selection effects that influenced their inclusion in the spectroscopic sample . in  3 , we model and interpret each spectroscopic class separately ; in this section we also examine whether analogous systems exist in the local universe and what these can tell us about the effects of dust extinction on the spectral properties of starburst galaxies . in ",
    "4 we analyse the predicted range of spectrophotometric paths of each class and investigate the possible evolutionary connections among the classes .",
    "we then use our sample of spectra for similarly distant ` field ' galaxies to compare the star formation activity in and out of clusters at this epoch , and we combine what has been learned on the star formation activity of the different classes with their _ hst _ morphologies , looking for connections between the two . in  5",
    "we also examine whether star formation activity in distant clusters is correlated with global cluster properties and we then summarize our main conclusions in  6 . unless otherwise stated we assume @xmath9 and take @xmath10kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the spectral classification scheme adopted in d99 and we analyse the possible selection effects in this sample .",
    "our classification scheme is based primarily on two lines , [ oii]@xmath123727 and @xmath13(@xmath14  ) , which are good indicators of ( respectively ) current and recent star formation ( sf ) in distant galaxy spectra .",
    "all the equivalent widths in this paper are given in   in the rest frame and with a negative value when in emission .",
    "the spectral classification scheme is presented in table  1 , taken from d99 .",
    "a full explanation of the notation denoting the various spectral classes can be found in d99 .",
    "only 62 out of the 657 spectra were too poor to be assigned a spectral class , and in 38 of these at least one emission line could be identified .",
    "thus we have spectral classifications for around 95% of our sample .    for the purposes of this paper we have also divided the balmer - strong galaxies with no emission ( k+a / a+k type ) into ` blue ' and ` red ' galaxies ( as was done in cs87 for the psg and hds classes respectively ) ; in this case the color threshold has been chosen to be @xmath15 ( in the observed frame at @xmath0 ) , equivalent to the one adopted in cs87 ( @xmath16 at @xmath17 ) , and it corresponds to the separation between the expected color of the early - type galaxies ( sa or earlier ) from the later - type spirals and irregulars ( sb and later ) .",
    "the galactic extinction in the direction of the clusters in our sample is negligible ( s97 ) , except in the case of cl0303@xmath1817 ( @xmath19 ) , and no reddening correction has been applied in this paper .",

    "1 between the cluster and the field diagrams is striking , and we will discuss it in  5.1 ; the field is missing the large population of k+a / a+k galaxies , while a large number of e(a ) spectra are still present ( d99 ) .",

    "the selection of the spectroscopic targets was influenced by galaxy morphology within the core region covered by the wfpc2 , while outside this area the catalog is essentially a magnitude - limited sample to @xmath34 mag ( d99 ) .",
    "the comparison between d99 and the morphological catalog ( s97 ) allows us to quantify this effect and apply the appropriate corrections . for each cluster",
    "we compared the fraction of a given morphological type in the spectroscopic catalog ( including both cluster members and field galaxies in each cluster field ) to the proportion observed in the _ hst _ catalog ( s97 ) down to the limiting magnitude in d99 .",
    "the ratio of these two fractions gives the total ( cluster + field ) morphological correction factors .",
    "these have been subsequently partitioned between cluster and field galaxies to find the final morphological corrections we have applied to the distributions in d99 .",

    "such a bias is not present in our sample and after having corrected for the morphological bias in the central fields , the whole spectral dataset represents an essentially magnitude - limited sample .",
    "all the results presented in this work have been corrected for these selection effects .",
    "we note that the spectroscopic sample analysed here is roughly limited at an absolute magnitude of @xmath42 or @xmath43 ( d99 ) while the morphological catalog on which our sample is based reaches down to @xmath44 ; this itself is 3 magnitudes brighter than the 5@xmath45 detection limit of the _ wfpc2 _ imaging data at the median cluster redshift ( s97 ) .",
    "the continuity in the sample properties for the galaxies in the full ( deeper ) morphological catalog compared to the spectroscopic sub - sample suggests that the latter is not missing large classes of galaxies due to surface - brightness selection limits , although we can not rule out a subtle bias resulting from the original object selection .",
    "in this section we model and interpret each spectroscopic class in isolation , before attempting to establish possible evolutionary relations between the various classes (  4 ) . in some cases",
    "we will also examine the properties of low redshift galaxies with similar spectra to provide further insights into the physical processes which are signposted by particular combinations of spectral features . in all of this",
    "our aim is to constrain , on the basis of the observed spectra , the past , present ( and future ) star formation history of these galaxies .",
    "all the models employed in this paper have been generated with the spectrophotometric code of barbaro & poggianti ( 1997 ) .",
    "this code has a number of advantages for the purpose of our study , in particular it includes both the contribution of the stellar component and the thermal emission of the ionized gas in hii regions .",
    "the stellar component is computed by an evolutionary synthesis model which takes into account the main evolutionary phases up to the agb and post - agb .",
    "the stellar model allows us to compute the integrated spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at low resolution over a wide wavelength range ( 20 , 100025000 ) and at higher resolution across a shorter interval ( 4 , 35007500 ) .",
    "the first version , based on kurucz stellar atmosphere models ( kurucz 1993 ) , is suitable for computing colors and studying low - resolution features ( such as the 4000  break ) with a wide wavelength coverage and including stellar populations of different metallicities . the second version , based on the stellar spectral library observed by jacoby et al .  ( 1984 ) ( mostly of solar metallicity ) , has enough resolution to study absorption features , such as the stellar lines of the balmer series .    in studying star - forming galaxies",
    "it is particularly useful to reproduce the nebular emission lines , which are the most prominent features of the integrated spectrum and which are directly related to the current star formation rate .",
    "the kurucz  based version of the stellar model computes the ionizing flux ( below 912 ) which is used to derive the luminosities of the nebular balmer lines assuming case b recombination ( optically thick , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the luminosities of a number of metallic lines , including [ oii]@xmath123727 , are computed using the grid of hii region models given by stasinska ( 1990 ) .",
    "the emission line spectrum is obtained assuming solar metallicity gas , and all the model equivalent widths have been measured using the same software that was used on the data .",
    "figure 2 shows the various types of star formation histories we have considered , which include spiral  like models ( panel a ) , truncated models ( panel b ) , truncated models with a burst ( panel c ) and spiral  like models with a burst ( panel d ) .",
    "the sfrs and properties of the spiral  like models have been published in barbaro & poggianti ( 1997 ) and resemble the set of sf histories described by sandage ( 1986 ) , where the ratio of present to past average sf increases towards later types .",
    "they correspond to the bruzual & charlot @xmath46 models with a wide range of sf timescales ( @xmath47 ) ; in particular , we have investigated a set of models with @xmath47 between 0.5 gyr and @xmath48 ( constant sfr ) , including also a model whose sfr constantly increases with time .      a large amount of theoretical work has been devoted to the interpretation of k+a / a+k spectra ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; cs87 ; henry & lavery 1987 ; newberry et al .  1990 ; belloni et al .  1995 ; barger et al .",

    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\a ) a spectrum with strong balmer lines in absorption ( ew@xmath49 ) and negligible emission lines belongs to a galaxy which has no significant current sf , but which was forming stars in the recent past ( @xmath50 gyr ) .",
    "strong @xmath51 equivalent widths ( @xmath5245 ) can only be reproduced by models seen in a quiescent phase soon after a starburst ; for this reason k+a",
    "/ a+k spectra are often identified with ` post - starburst galaxies ' .",
    "moderately strong balmer lines ( @xmath5345 ) can also be obtained by simply halting the star formation in a galaxy which was forming stars in a regular , continuous manner ( truncated models ) , but the exact threshold between these two regimes is not well defined , since it is affected by the uncertainties in the measurement of the ew , both in the data and in the models .",
    "newberry et al .  (",
    "1990 ) showed that truncated , as well as burst models , could reproduce the properties of passive , balmer - strong galaxies seen in the first spectroscopic surveys , which gave much looser constraints than subsequent data .",
    "more recently , truncated models without a starburst are advocated by morris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , although their definition of a truncated model is different from the one generally adopted .",

    "the galaxy did not form any star before the 1 gyr constant sf ( 13 gyr before the @xmath55 strong phase ) and using the definitions commonly employed in the literature , this is a post  starburst model where the burst involves 100% of the galactic mass .",

    "this range of timescales is determined by the lifetime of the stars responsible for the strong balmer lines ( poggianti & barbaro 1997 ) ;    \\c ) spectral models using a standard salpeter imf show that a significant fraction of the galactic mass needs to be involved ( @xmath5620% ) in the recent star formation episode in order to explain the highest ew(@xmath13 ) typically observed .",
    "in fact , the most extreme cases ( @xmath57 ) can hardly be reproduced with a standard imf at all ( poggianti & barbaro 1996 ; zabludoff , priv .",

    "prior _ to any burst can not be determined from a post - starburst spectrum ( unless ultraviolet data sampling around 1500  in the rest frame is available ) .",
    "however , the high mass fractions implied for the burst have always suggested that later - type galaxies are more likely progenitors owing to their higher gas fractions ( poggianti 1994 ) .",
    "this suggestion has received support from the _ hst_-based morphological studies ( couch et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; dressler et al .",

    "these low ew([oii])/ew(@xmath81 + [ nii ] ) ratios can be explained as an effect of dust : the line emission comes from the hii regions , where the young stars are still embedded in large amounts of interstellar matter . in a very dusty environment , both lines suffer strong extinction , [ oii ] being more affected than the @xmath82 .",

    "the net result is a lower ratio of the equivalent widths of the two lines .",

    "in contrast , the spectral properties and [ oii]/@xmath81 ratios of the e(c ) and the e(b ) spectra do nt show evidence for a high dust extinction and the dust  free models discussed in  3.2 and  3.3 can be considered appropriate .    in a dusty starburst",
    "a high fraction of the bolometric luminosity is emitted at fir wavelengths and since this is an optically  selected sample , one might worry about biases in the selection of the e(a ) sample relative to the other ( less reddened ) spectral classes .",
    "the competing effects of dust and starbursts on the luminosities of the e(a ) are complicated to investigate .",
    "the net effect depends upon the details of the mixing of the dust with the young and old stars within the galaxy . for likely burst strengths we would expect a brightening during the peak of the burst phase of 12 magnitudes in the restframe @xmath85-band ( fig .",
    "however , the observed ratio of h@xmath86 to [ oii ] equivalent widths suggests that the visual extinction to the emission line regions is in the range 1.22.5 magnitudes .",
    "as the majority of the blue and visual luminosity resulting from the starburst is also likely to reside in these regions we expect that the two effects will roughly cancel .",
    "only after the stars have diffused out of these high extinction regions will the dust become less effective , but the burst population will also have evolved and faded by this time .",
    "this cancellation suggests that there will be a relatively modest variation in optical luminosity for different burst strengths . using the far - infrared luminosity as a tracer of the strength of the starburst",
    "we see exactly this behaviour at low-@xmath87 .",
    "in fact , a range of over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath88 for infrared  selected galaxies at low  redshift is accompanied by less than a factor of 34 change in the optical luminosity ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . as an extreme case ,",
    "the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath89 ) have optical luminosities comparable to present  day @xmath90 ( sanders & mirabel 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the fir properties of our e(a ) galaxies are probably less extreme , but even so their optical luminosities are not expected to be less than 1/21/3 of @xmath91 .",
    "the d99 spectral catalog provides a representative luminosity distribution of cluster members at @xmath92 , 1.2 magnitudes below the @xmath93 of spiral galaxies at the cluster redshift ( s97 ) .",
    "we conclude that in general we expect the optical luminosities of the e(a ) population to be crudely comparable to that expected for a non - bursting system .",
    "this suggests that there is no strong bias in our characterisation of this population due to its dusty nature .",
    "it is clear that galaxies with e(a ) spectra appear in the low ",

    "at low-@xmath87 as estimated from the las campanas redshift survey ( 8% , hashimoto 1998 ) appears lower than in the distant field and clusters , although this comparison is an uncertain one because of the difference in the samples and the classification criteria .    at redshifts comparable to the d99 catalog , a population of balmer strong galaxies with emission is present in the field sample of the canada - france redshift survey ( see fig .  15 in hammer et al .",
    "1997 and hammer & flores 1998 ) .",
    "although a direct comparison can not be made , their balmer index versus d4000 plot is equivalent to our fig .  1 and the e(a ) population is evident both at @xmath94 and at @xmath95 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the field sample in d99 ( see  5.2 and fig .  1 ) .",
    "we will now try to identify the possible evolutionary paths among the spectral classes and hence discuss how the interpretation of e(a ) spectra as dusty starbursts suggests they are good candidates for precursors of the k+a / a+k population .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the high proportion of k+a / a+k spectra observed in distant clusters indicates that a moderate fraction of cluster members were forming stars in the recent past but that this activity terminated at an epoch close to the time at which they are observed . in this sense",
    "their spectral properties indicate a sharp decrease in star formation activity . at the same time , in many cases the strong @xmath13 observed requires a burst of star formation prior to the sharp decline .",
    "given that the post ",
    "starburst models spend the second half of their k+a / a+k lifetime having more moderate @xmath55 strengths which progressively decline towards the 3  threshold ( poggianti & barbaro 1996 ) , at least some of the k+a / a+k spectra in the range @xmath96 are expected to be the remnants of much stronger cases . therefore , on the basis of standard ",
    "imf models , we find that a large fraction , possibly all , of the k+a / a+k galaxies in our sample are likely to have experienced a recent starburst .",
    "although this fraction is surely significant , a quantitative estimate is problematic , given the uncertainty in the exact threshold between post  starburst and truncated models and the modest incompleteness of the sample for ew(@xmath13 ) between 3 and 5  ( d99 ) .",
    "the post - starburst interpretation of the k+a / a+k spectra necessarily poses the question of where are the starbursts , i.e.  what is the progenitor population of the post - starburst galaxies ?",
    "our modeling shows that if no dust extinction is involved and a standard imf is assumed , then the combination of a high sfr ( required from the balmer lines of the post - starburst galaxies ) and short timescales ( typical of starbursts ) inevitably leads to emission lines with high equivalent widths . about 5% of our spectra show such strong emission lines ( e(b ) class ) , and therefore at face value these",
    "would be the most obvious candidate progenitors of the strong post - starburst k+a / a+k population .",
    "we now show that the evolutionary scenario from e(b ) to k+a / a+k spectra fails to account for the relative luminosity distributions observed for these two classes in the distant clusters . as discussed in d99 , galaxies with e(b ) spectra are conspicuously fainter than all the other spectral classes .",

    "this timescale , @xmath110 , is about 1.5gyr and corresponds to the average time elapsed between the moment these galaxies ` enter ' the cluster ( i.e.  would be classified cluster members according to our criteria ) and the moment they stop forming stars and therefore lose their emission lines .",

    "the prevalence of k and k+a / a+k spirals in clusters points to an environmental process capable of stopping star formation ( remove the gas reservoir ) on a sufficiently short timescale to allow strong balmer features to be visible for quite a long period .",
