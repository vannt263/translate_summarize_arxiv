    "pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) is a fundamental technique for background rejection in scintillator detectors .",
    "it relies on the different time profiles of the emitted scintillator light to solicitations from particles with different energy losses . for this reason , it is particularly effective for discriminating heavy particles ( ions , alphas or protons ) from light particles ( electrons , positrons ) .",
    "even so , electrons and positrons generate similar light pulses and therefore psd fails in discriminating them .",
    "psd discrimination between electrons and positrons can be recovered exploiting the deformation of the positron induced light pulse shape caused by the formation of positronium , a meta - stable positron - electron bound state .",
    "depending on the system total spin , the positronium can be formed in the singlet state , called para - positronium ( p - ps , b.r .",
    "25@xmath0 ) , or in the triplet state , called ortho - positronium ( o - ps , b.r .",
    "75@xmath0 ) . due to the charge - conjugation invariance",
    ", p - ps decays into two 511 kev gammas , with a mean life in vacuum of 125 ps , where o - ps decays into three gammas of total energy equal to 2@xmath1 , with a mean life in vacuum of 142 ns .",
    "nevertheless , in matter the o - ps mean life is strongly reduced by the interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "chemical reactions ( oxidation , compound compositions ) , magnetic effects ( spin flip ) or pick - off ( positron annihilation with an anti - parallel spin electron of the medium ) cause the o - ps to decay into two gammas with a mean life of a few ns .",
    "the decay into three gammas is usually reduced to a negligible fraction .",
    "an o - ps mean life of a few ns is not enough for separating the positron energy deposition from the annihilation gammas in scintillator detectors , but it can still induce a positron pulse shape deformation strong enough to enhance electron - positron discrimination . this enhancement could be exploited in reactor neutrino experiments @xcite , in which anti - neutrino detection is performed via inverse beta decay @xmath2 the positron energy deposition and its following annihilation provide the prompt event and the neutron absorption the delayed event .",
    "an o - ps enhanced psd could allow to suppress the accidental background and to reject the residual correlated background , given by the cosmogenic @xmath3n emitters @xmath4li and @xmath5he .",
    "the same technique can be also exploited for background rejection in underground low background experiments , like borexino @xcite and sno+ @xcite , in which several @xmath6 emitters ( @xmath5b , @xmath4be , @xmath7c ) produced by cosmic muon spallation , constitute an unavoidable source of background .",
    "it has already been successfully applied in borexino for the detection of solar _ pep _ neutrinos , where the rejection of cosmogenic @xmath8c is essential for the signal extraction .",
    "the characterization of o - ps properties , i.e. the measurement of its formation probability and lifetime , has been performed for the most commonly used liquid scintillators , namely pc , lab , pxe and oil , and for the mixture pc + ppo @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of scintillator doping on the o - ps properties has been studied for different dopants : gd , commonly used in reactor neutrino experiments to enhance the neutrino signal identification , and nd , originally considered as neutrinoless double beta decay signal source in the sno+ experiment .",
    "forthcoming measures will characterize also li - loaded and tl - loaded liquid scintillators , the latter being chosen as new dopant for the sno+ scintillator .",
    "the o - ps properties ( lifetime and formation probability ) in scintillator are measured by means of a 0.8 mbq @xmath9na source in a fast coincidence system .",
    "the radio - isotope @xmath9na decays @xmath6 to @xmath9ne with a b.r . of 89.2@xmath0 ( q - value = 2.842 mev ) . in 99.944@xmath0 of cases ,",
    "the decay is to an excited state of @xmath9ne , which de - excites emitting a 1.274 mev gamma .",
    "the o - ps properties are extrapolated from the measurement of the time distance between the de - excitation gamma ( prompt signal ) and the positron annihilation gammas ( dealyed signal ) .",
    "a droplet of inert solvent containing the source is deposited between two identical supports , 1 cm in radius , each composed by two 7.5 @xmath10 m thick kapton foils .",
    "kapton is an aromatic polyimide material where positrons are known not to form positronium @xcite .",
    "the source sandwich is placed into a vial containing the scintillator sample .",
    "the vial is in turn positioned between two plastic scintillator detectors , each coupled to a pmt .",
    "the threshold on the first detector is set to 900 kev to isolate the @xmath9ne de - excitation gamma , while the second detector selects gammas between 350 kev and 500 kev , in order to accept the annihilation gammas but reject the de - excitation gamma backscattering .",
    "a constant fraction discriminator generates a fast timing signal at each trigger from the two detectors . a time to amplitude converter generates a signal linearly increasing with time , starting at the prompt signal and stopping at the delayed signal .",
    "the output is digitized by a 4096 channels adc .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] shows an example of resulting time spectrum .",
    "the system is calibrated using a @xmath11co source , and each adc channel is found to corresponds to 10.6 ps .",
    "the resolution is measured with the fast coincidence ( 182 ps ) gammas from @xmath12bi and found to be 0.28 ns at fwhm .",
    "positronium has been characterized in common liquid scintillators ( pc , pxe , lab , oil , pc + ppo ) at room temperature .",
    "each sample has been flushed with nitrogen and then measured with a @xmath13 event statistics , repeatedly from 3 to 5 times , in order to account for possible variations in the experimental conditions ( temperature , oxygen concentration ) .",
    "the obtained time distributions are fitted using the roofit toolkit @xcite , embedded in the root package and based on minuit .",
    "the fit function is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the step function and a@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the amplitude and mean life of the _ i_-th component : the first accounts for the effective contribution of direct annihilation and p - ps , while the second accounts for the o - ps .",
    "the constant term accounts for accidentals .",
    "the function @xmath18 is convoluted with the detector resolution function , the sum of two gaussians with the same mean value , but different sigmas ( @xmath19 = 110 ps and @xmath20 = 160 ps ) and relative weights ( g@xmath21 = 0.8 and g@xmath22 = 0.2 ) . the obtained normalized @xmath23 are in the range between 0.85 and 0.94 and the statistical errors are at the per mil level .    the o - ps mean life",
    "is given directly by the fit parameter @xmath24 , while the formation probability @xmath25 is computed as the fraction of o - ps relative to the annihilations in the scintillator @xmath26 the fraction of direct annihilations in kapton , a@xmath27 , has been extrapolated from dedicated measurements with different number of kapton layers and estimated to be ( 20.6 @xmath28 0.2)@xmath0 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is evaluated from the dispersion of the measured mean lives from the weighted average of the corresponding scintillator sample .",
    "the distribution of all the dispersions is fitted to a gaussian , whose standard deviation is taken as the systematic error .",
    "the same procedure is followed for the formation probability .",
    "the resulting systematic errors are 0.03 ns and 0.5@xmath0 .",
    "table [ tab : a ] reports the results for the gd - loaded and nd - loaded liquid scintillators at the different concentrations . both of the dopants show the same effect on the o - ps properties : the mean life remains stable under dopant concentration variations , while the formation probability decreases from @xmath2950@xmath0 at concentrations of the order of few tenths per mil to @xmath2940@xmath0 at concentrations around 0.5@xmath0 .",
