    "this paper considers the stability of toroidal magnetic fields in rotating radiation zones of stars and focuses on the destabilizing effect of finite thermal diffusion and the stabilizing effect of differential rotation .",
    "the equations for the linear stability of toroidal magnetic fields under the influences of basic rotation and gravitational buoyancy are solved for two different latitudinal profiles of the toroidal field , i.e. with the two possible symmetries with respect to the equator .",
    "our equations are global in both horizontal dimensions but they are local in radius , i.e. the short - wave approximation @xmath6 is used ( @xmath7 is the radial wave number ) .    we know that a toroidal magnetic field @xmath8 which fulfills the condition @xmath9 is unstable against nonaxisymmetric disturbances in an ideal and incompressible medium ( tayler 1957 , 1973 , vandakurov 1972 , acheson 1978 ) . here @xmath10 is the distance from the axis where @xmath11 .",
    "this ` tayler instability ' ( ti ) is suppressed by rigid rotation unless the magnetic field is strong enough to fulfill the condition @xmath12 ( pitts and tayler 1985 ) with the magnetic frequency @xmath13 and the rotational frequency @xmath14 of the star . for a simple spherical model with @xmath15 const ( one magnetic belt with maximum in the equatorial plane ) the dashed line in figure  [ f0 ]",
    "demonstrates this situation where the solar value of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath16 of @xmath17 was used . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the microscopic values of the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the growth rate @xmath20 at the vertical axis of the plot is normalized with the basic rotation so that the result of the calculation is @xmath21 the instability thus exists only for subalfvnic rotation and it is obviously very fast , i.e. @xmath22 .    due to the assumed isothermal state of the medium no buoyancy - term exists in this calculation .",
    "generally , in stably - stratified plasma the real buoyancy is ` negative ' and should stabilize the magnetic instability .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ f0 ] results from a model with adiabatic density fluctuations in boussinesq approximation , i.e. for vanishing thermal diffusivity @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting field strength for onset of instability slightly exceeds its value without buoyancy .",
    "surprisingly , the stabilization of the ti by ` negative buoyancy ' is a small effect .",
    "the opposite case with @xmath24 provides results identical with those for the incompressible model ( dashed line ) .",
    "no temperature fluctuations can develop for @xmath25 so that the stabilizing effect of buoyancy does not apply .",
    "after inspection of the extremes @xmath26 and @xmath27 one could believe that the inclusion of the thermal equation into the instability theory is not significant .",
    "we know , however , that the heat conductivity in the stellar radiation zones is the most effective dissipation process , far from the adiabatic limit , i.e. @xmath28 the prandtl number of the gas is of order @xmath29 which yields a roberts number @xmath30 of @xmath31 .",
    "note that liquid metals of mhd laboratory experiments have @xmath32 .",
    "the nonadiabatic models with small prandtl number ( see equation ( [ eq5 ] ) ) will lead to a surprising result .",
    "the buoyancy does _ not _ suppress the instability any longer but it creates another instability which exists for much weaker magnetic fields .",
    "acheson ( 1978 ) found that the roberts number q enters the stability equations in a rather complicated manner so that one term acts stabilizing while another one acts destabilizing .",
    "`` it is natural , therefore , to expect quite complicated changes in the stability properties of the system ... '' .",
    "all terms , however , vanish when @xmath33",
    ". we shall find that indeed finite thermal conductivities lead to a destabilization of magnetic fields with @xmath1 much smaller than @xmath2 ; the growth rates of this doubly - diffusive instability , however , are small .",
    "neither time stepping codes nor technical experiments can find such slow instabilities with growth rates of order @xmath34 .",
    "of course , such timescales are still very short compared to stellar evolutionary times but the physical relevance of such instabilities is still in question ( cally 2003 ) .",
    "critical for the astrophysical meaning of nonaxisymmetric magnetic instabilities is also the differential rotation .",
    "one expects that the nonuniform rotation acts against the excitation of nonaxisymmetric modes if they are already excited for rigid rotation . in the solar tachocline the rotation law is  per definition  nonuniform .",
    "the differential rotation itself is needed for the production of the strong toroidal fields leading to the tachocline phenomenon .",
    "a possible magnetic instability of these toroidal fields ( `` tayler - spruit dynamo '' ) should basically be stabilized by the nonuniformity of the rotation .",
    "one has thus to check how important the differential rotation is to stabilize / destabilize the toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "there are indications that the influence of the differential rotation strongly depends on the symmetry type of the toroidal field patterns with respect to the equator . in the present paper only fields with antisymmetry with respect to the equator are considered as subject to differential rotation .",
    "the equations for small disturbances ( @xmath35 ) of background magnetic ( @xmath36 ) and velocity ( @xmath37 ) fields are @xmath38 for the velocity fluctuations @xmath39 , @xmath40 for the magnetic fluctuations @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the entropy fluctuations",
    "@xmath43 related to the density fluctuations by @xmath44 .",
    "the basic flow is a rotation with uniform angular velocity @xmath2 and the mean magnetic field @xmath45 has only a toroidal component @xmath8 .",
    "the mathematical method for solving the equation system ( [ 5])([7 ] ) has been described earlier ( kitchatinov and rdiger 2008 ) . in this previous paper",
    "the instability has been considered for the case of rigid rotation and for given heat conductivity . in the present paper the _",
    "destabilizing _ role of the heat conductivity is demonstrated and first results for the _ stabilizing _ role of differential rotation are given .",
    "the equations are global in horizontal dimensions but local in radius .",
    "the radial scale of disturbances is assumed as short and their dependence on radius @xmath46 is taken in the form of fourier modes @xmath47 .",
    "there are only symmetry conditions along the polar axes which will be fulfilled by the series expansions after legendre polynomials .",
    "only the modes with @xmath0 are considered . then at the axes",
    "the radial components of flow and field must vanish and also the @xmath48-derivatives of the horizontal components ( see elstner _",
    "_ 1990 , gilman and fox 1997 ) . for given radial wave number and for given field amplitude ( in units of the basic rotation velocity ) the resulting eigenfrequency is computed including growth rate ( imaginary part of @xmath49 ) of the instability and drift rate of the eigensolutions ( real part of @xmath49 ) .",
    "the key parameter for the effect of the stable stratification is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the buoyancy frequency @xmath52 in stellar radiation zones it is @xmath53 .",
    "for the most unstable modes we find @xmath54 so that the radial scale of the modes is indeed small , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "our equations include finite diffusion via @xmath55 with @xmath19 and @xmath18 as the magnetic resistivity and the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath23 enters the equations in the normalized form @xmath56 which is the free parameter in the following discussion .",
    "the present article focuses on the effect of thermal diffusivity from the following reason .",
    "the current - driven tayler instability requires radial displacements .",
    "the instability does not exist in the 2d case of purely horizontal disturbances ( see dicke 1979 ) . in a stably stratified radiation zone",
    "the radial displacements are opposed by buoyancy .",
    "finite thermal diffusivity reduces the buoyancy and thus supports the instability .",
    "the relevant parameter is the ratio @xmath57 @xmath58 of the frequency @xmath59 , with which the thermal diffusion destroys the buoyancy , to the characteristic frequency @xmath60 of gravity waves .",
    "when @xmath61 and @xmath62 are simultaneously varied for constant @xmath57-parameter ( [ 3 ] ) the results change little .",
    "the toroidal field profile of the model is parameterized as @xmath63 where now @xmath64 is the _ amplitude _ of the magnetic alfvn frequency .",
    "computations were made for @xmath65 so that the toroidal field is symmetric ( or quadrupolar ) with respect to the equator .",
    "the other model with @xmath66 represents a ( dipolar ) background field antisymmetric relative to the equator or  in other words  with two belts of opposite signs .",
    "the diffusion parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 characteristic for the upper radiation zone of the sun are kept fixed and @xmath61 is varied to study the effect of thermal diffusion .    the normalized wavelengths ( [ 1 ] )",
    "were also kept constant .",
    "the constant values were @xmath69 for quadrupolar background field ( @xmath65)and @xmath70 for dipolar fields ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the choice is motivated by the finding that for this values of @xmath62 the marginal field strengths for onset of the instability are minimized .",
    "the values of @xmath62 corresponding to maximum growth rates of supercritical excitations change with the external parameters but only slightly . some results of this paper were obtained for the instability modes of symmetry type s1 , the equatorially symmetric excitations with azimuthal wave number @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath71 and for the given prandtl number ( [ eq5 ] ) one finds @xmath72 as the solar value .",
    "computing the critical magnetic frequencies under the presence of differential rotation the wave numbers have been varied as long as the minimum eigenvalues have been found ( see below ) .",
    "the linear code is able to calculate the eigenfrequencies for the realistic small magnetic prandtl number @xmath73 so far the best nonlinear mhd codes reach values down to 0.001 @xcite .",
    "in the following the stability of the magnetic background field ( [ 4 ] ) is probed for nonaxisymmetric disturbances with the azimuthal wave number @xmath0 and with a fixed radial scale . by use of the method described by kitchatinov and rdiger ( 2008 ) the complex equation system ( [ 5])([7 ] )",
    "is numerically solved to find the growth rate of a possible instability .",
    "generally , the results do not change if @xmath74 is replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , for purely toroidal magnetic fields there is no handedness in the system .",
    "the addition of even a weak poloidal field would break the symmetry between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we start with @xmath65 as the most simple case .",
    "as the fields are symmetric with respect to the equator this model resembles stellar models with toroidal fields of quadrupolar parity .",
    "the growth rates of the instability for various values of the thermal diffusivity parameter @xmath57 are shown in figure .",
    "all the lines converge for sufficiently strong fields , @xmath76 , showing that then the instability is insensitive to diffusion .",
    "the growth rates @xmath20 for strong fields can be estimated as @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic instability in adiabatic fluids , i.e. with @xmath78 , is suppressed by the rotation , @xcite .",
    "but for finite thermal diffusion also weak fields under the presence of superalfvnic rotation , @xmath79 , are unstable though with small growth rates .",
    "the growth rates initially increase with increasing @xmath57 to saturate for about @xmath80 ( figure [ f1 ] , left ) . due to its very small growth rates",
    "the instability of weak fields ( @xmath81 ) for both small and very large @xmath57 can not be detected with time stepping codes ( see braithwaite 2006 ) .    in the wide range @xmath82",
    "also a weak - field instability is faintly sensitive to thermal diffusivity .",
    "the growth rate runs as @xmath83 only for very large @xmath57 when the buoyancy is totally suppressed the results for unstratified fluids with their strong rotational suppression of the instability are reproduced ( figure [ f1 ] , right ) .",
    "the case of one magnetic belt , @xmath84 , is exceptional @xcite .",
    "when the ratio of rotational velocity to alfvn velocity is uniform then there is no preferred latitude for the instability to start .",
    "finite thermal diffusion promotes the instability as the effect of diffusion depends on the latitudinal scale of the disturbances .",
    "the isothermal limit @xmath85 represents also the case of unstratified fluid and the instability is totally suppressed for fast rotation .",
    "we find a different situation for dipolar background fields ( @xmath66 ) with two belts of opposite polarity as resulting from the interaction of differential rotation and dipolar poloidal fields .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the results . in the above model of quadrupolar fields ,",
    "the vertical lines of figure  [ f0 ] for adiabatic ( @xmath86 ) and isothermal ( @xmath27 ) disturbances are rather parallel and close together .",
    "now the ( dashed ) line for @xmath87 ( or , what is the same , for unstratified fluids ) and the vertical line for @xmath86 differ completely .",
    "the dashed line is close below the line for @xmath57= 1000 for which the maximum growth rates appear .",
    "it also shows the typical behavior ( [ 42 ] ) for subequipartition fields ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "consequently , one finds the relation ( [ 42 ] ) true for all nonadiabatic disturbances in fluids with @xmath88 .",
    "hence , if the very small growth rates are acceptable , then already toroidal fields with @xmath89 become unstable if the @xmath57 is not too small .",
    "for the sun the maximum strength of stable fields is about 500 gauss ( cf .",
    "spruit 1999 ) .",
    "note that the growth rates for the solar value of @xmath90 differ slightly from the growth rates for isothermal case .",
    "for the stellar magnetic fields with dipolar parity , @xmath91 already represents the situation for @xmath27 .",
    "the inclusion of the buoyancy is thus not even necessary .",
    "this statement does not hold for the above model of quadrupolar field geometry .",
    "a very new feature of the considered two - belts geometry are resonances .",
    "the lines with fixed but small @xmath57 show two peaks at magnetic field amplitudes slightly below the equipartition level of @xmath92 .",
    "the resonant eigenmodes do not appear in the one - belt model and they show a more detailed fine - structure than the nonresonant ones ( figure  [ f3 ] ) . as a doubling of the resolution does not change the results the numerically detected resonances seem to be real .",
    "note that all the unstable modes are global in horizontal dimensions .",
    "the resonant nature of the peaks in figure  [ f2 ] is illustrated by figure  [ f4 ] showing the drift velocities for a small @xmath93 .",
    "generally , the unstable modes drift against the direction of the global rotation . note that the drift rates of the resonant modes are zero .",
    "these modes corotate with the fluid .    for strong fields with @xmath94 the instability pattern does not follow the basic rotation .",
    "the normalized drift rates approach the value of -1 which means that the modes are resting in the inertial frame of reference .",
    "test calculations showed that this result also holds for @xmath95 which for the interior of hot stars is not unrealistic due to the large radiative viscosity .",
    "the nonaxisymmetric field pattern produced by instability of a strong field seems to rest in the laboratory system .",
    "if only such a magnetic pattern is observed on a star then it seems to rest or to exhibit an extremely slow rotation .",
    "the steepness of the drift rate profile of figure  [ f4 ] suggests that the transition between the nondrifting solution ( where the difference between the rotation of the star and the rotation of the magnetic field is very small ) and the drifting solution ( where the magnetic pattern rotation disappear ) is very sharp .",
    "if ap stars are assumed as stars with unstable toroidal background fields ( which themselves are invisible ) then two groups among them should exist depending on the ratio of @xmath64 to @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic field pattern of the group with @xmath81 rotates slightly slower than the star but the magnetic field pattern of the group with @xmath96 should rotate extremely slow .",
    "the instability for strong fields is very fast .",
    "the growth times for this case after the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) are shorter than the rotation period . on the other hand , after ( [ 42 ] ) the instability of so weak fields that @xmath81 is much slower .",
    "it is , however , hardly controlled by the thermal diffusion .",
    "the instability of weak fields in stellar radiation zones should thus not be too sensitive to the chemical details .",
    "sofar we have assumed the stellar rotation as rigid .",
    "this is only true if the star is old enough .",
    "a possible differential rotation produces a strong toroidal field from the original fossil poloidal field .",
    "the resulting maxwell stress suppresses the differential rotation producing an almost rigid rotation after the alfvn travel time estimated for the poloidal field which for hot stars with fields of order mgauss lasts longer than 10 myr .",
    "hence , for young stars the instability of the field pattern must be considered under the presence of differential rotation .",
    "as the current - driven instability is basically nonaxisymmetric one must expect the action of the differential rotation as stabilizing so that a possible instability might occur only after the alfvn travel time .",
    "we have worked with the simple rotation law @xmath97 which in its simplified local formulation reads as @xmath98 .",
    "equation ( [ 45 ] ) describes a rotation law with cylindric isolines . for negative @xmath99",
    "the rotation rate decreases outwards and v.v .",
    "the stabilizing effect of the differential rotation should _ not _ depend on the sign of @xmath99 .    here",
    "we only consider the magnetic field geometry ( [ 4 ] ) for dipolar field structures , i.e. with antisymmetry of the fields with respect to the equator .",
    "figure [ f7 ] gives the results for @xmath72 .",
    "the critical magnetic frequencies are optimized by choice of the wave numbers .",
    "we find the stabilization by differential rotation as highly effective .",
    "already very small shear values lead to an increase of the critical magnetic field by a factor of ( say ) five .",
    "the influences of both the sign and the real value of @xmath99 are small .",
    "the figure [ f7 ] suggests a very efficient stabilization of the toroidal fields by any kind of differential rotation if the field is antisymmetric with respect to the equator .",
    "the same might _ not _ be true for other field geometries ( see rdiger and schultz 2010 ) .",
    "hence , we find the toroidal magnetic fields in stellar tachoclines with their strong differential rotation ( if due to a fossil poloidal dipolar field ) much more stable than they are in the rigidly rotating cores of stars .",
    "the stabilizing action of differential rotation does hardly depend on the form of the rotation law .",
    "if the star rotates nonhomogeneously then higher amplitudes of the induced toroidal fields remain stable .",
    "the results of this section suggest the importance of further studies of the interaction of magnetic fields and differential rotation .",
    "if the fields are produced by a dynamo mechanism then the magnetic field geometry can easily differ ( like in galaxies ) from that considered in the present paper .",
    "we have shown that for realistic values of the heat diffusivity the growth rates of the kink - type instability in stellar radiation zones do hardly differ from the growth rates obtained for fully incompressible models without buoyancy .",
    "there are , however , strong differences for other types of the magnetic geometry .",
    "cylindric models with uniform alfvn frequency do not completely cover the situation for spherical models with toroidal fields of dipolar parity .",
    "for stellar applications the main results for the instability of such fields are given in figure  [ f6 ] .",
    "note how well the approximation without gravity @xmath100 and/or @xmath24 ( dashed line ) works in comparison to the ` exact ' profile for @xmath101 ( solid line ) .    after the figure  [ f6 ] ( left )",
    "three groups of hot stars can be distinguished in dependence on the amplitude of their toroidal fields .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field of the first group fulfills the relation @xmath102 so that it remains stable .",
    "if the field amplitude exceeds the lower limit ( or the rotation is slow enough ) then there are two possibilities .",
    "if it is not too strong , i.e. @xmath81 , then it becomes unstable with very small rates of growth and azimuthal drift .",
    "if strong enough , the poloidal component of the resulting nonaxisymmetric field should be observable .",
    "the critical alfvn velocity for a typical hot star is about 10 km / s corresponding to a magnetic field of order 10@xmath103 gauss .",
    "if only 1% of the magnetic energy move to the poloidal perturbation , the amplitude of poloidal field is about 10@xmath104 gauss ( see gellert _",
    "this value is even larger than the observed fields of ap stars .",
    "the third group of stars fulfills the condition @xmath96 .",
    "they are unstable with very short growth times .",
    "their drift rates , however , approach the value of -1 so that the magnetic patterns may only show a very slow global rotation .",
    "there are indeed examples among the group of the ap stars with rotation periods of several years .",
    "the bright star @xmath20 equ has a rotation period longer than 70 yr .    in the light of the presented theory the basic fact that the ap stars are slow rotators compared with the normal",
    "a stars mainly means that slow rotation is less stabilizing for the toroidal magnetic fields . with other words ,",
    "the condition @xmath105 for instability is more easily fulfilled for slow rotators .",
    "it is thus understandable with our results that for slow rotation weaker toroidal fields become unstable and also the resulting amplitude of the @xmath0 mode is smaller for slow rotation than for fast rotation  which indeed is observed @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath105 for instability could easily be the counterpart of the lower limit of about 300 gauss found by aurire _",
    "( 2007 ) for magnetic fields of ap stars .",
    "the existence of rather strong toroidal magnetic fields within stellar radiation zones can be thought of as the outcome of the differential rotation and a weak fossil poloidal field . for the above calculations we have assumed that the differential rotation only exists before the magnetic instability develops .",
    "the reason is that ( any form of ) differential rotation stabilizes the instability of fields with equatorial antisymmetry .",
    "from this point of view all the ap stars are considered as ( slow ) rigid rotators .",
    "a complete explanation of the ap star magnetism still meets open questions .",
    "so the axis of the magnetic field pattern is obviously _ not _ orthogonal to the axis of rotation ( oetken 1977 ) .",
    "the obliquity of the field , i.e. the ratio of nonaxisymmetric and axisymmetric field parts , depends on the rotation rate : it is maximum for large @xmath2 ( landstreet and mathys 2000 ) .",
    "the instability of a single @xmath0 mode can not explain this finding .",
    "it is also known that the magnetic ap stars do _ not _ exist close to the zams , they are concentrated toward the center of the main - sequence .",
    "the earliest observed evolution time across the main - sequence of a magnetic ap and bp star is about 20 myr , no one younger magnetic star has been observed ( hubrig _ et al . _ 2000 ) .",
