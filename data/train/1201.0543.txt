    "in 1879 , edward h. hall discovered that when an electric field flows through a conductor in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , charge carriers subjected to the lorentz force are pushed to one side of the conductor . at equilibrium ,",
    "the carrier accumulation generates a transverse bias to balance the lorentz force .",
    "this is the famous `` hall effect '' . in two - dimensional electron systems ,",
    "the quantized version of hall effect was observed due to landau quantization ,  @xcite which is characterized by a precisely quantized hall conductance , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is known as the tknn number or chern number .",
    "@xcite    to produce a hall effect , breaking time - reversal symmetry is an essential condition .",
    "in addition to magnetic field , an internal magnetization coupled with spin - orbit coupling could also give rise to the hall effect . to distinguish from the ordinary hall effect",
    ", this magnetization - induced one was called `` anomalous '' hall effect . although it has been experimentally observed for over one century ,",
    "the physical origin of anomalous hall effect is still unclear . in general , the mechanism of anomalous hall effect is classified as extrinsic or intrinsic according to its origins .",
    "the extrinsic one arises from the spin - dependent scattering impurities , while the latter one can be expressed in terms of berry - phase curvatures in the crystal momentum space .",
    "@xcite    similar to the quantization of the ordinary hall effect , the anomalous hall effect was also predicted to be quantized by haldane in a honey - comb lattice toy model with vanishing magnetic field .",

    "5d _ transition metal atoms on the hollow sites of graphene . the final realization of qah effect will not only enable the application of novel quantum devices due to the dissipationless nature , but also mark the ultimate achievement of a clear understanding of the intrinsic mechanism of the anomalous hall effect .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we demonstrate a microscopic theory to study the physical origins of the qah effect in graphene due to the presence of both rashba spin - orbit coupling and exchange using a low - energy continuum model . in the limit of strong exchange field and weak rashba spin - orbit coupling , the quantization of the hall conductance should be attributed to the real spin texture - induced skyrmions and _ ab _ sublattice pseudo - spin texture - induced merons .",
