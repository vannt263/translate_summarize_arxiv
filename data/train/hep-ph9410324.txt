    "we have recently developed a fully relativistic model of hadrons containing one heavy quark @xcite .",
    "hadronic matrix elements are represented by quark loop graphs with momentum dependent interaction vertices between hadron , heavy quark and light quark .",
    "the only parameters in the model are the quark masses .",
    "we previously applied the model to @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the model does not rely on any expansion in inverse powers of heavy - quark masses @xmath12 .",
    "however , qcd imposes severe constraints on the form of the heavy - quark expansion , and not all models automatically satisfy these constraints @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the heavy - quark expansion of our model does satisfy these constraints .",
    "confinement is modeled in a simple way ; we simply drop the imaginary parts of our loop graphs .",
    "this prescription preserves the symmetry structure of the theory , and our hypothesis is that it may give reasonable results as long as external momenta of a diagram are such as to be far removed from whatever unphysical singularites the diagram possesses .",
    "( a discussion of the singularity structure of our three - point functions , including anomalous thresholds , may be found in @xcite . )",
    "we are finding that this simple , most naive model of confinement is yielding some very encouraging results .",
    "it also acts as a useful preview to the general bethe - salpeter approach .    although our results are based only on a model , they suggest that some caution is required in the use of more systematic attempts to extract information from qcd",
    ". in particular , some important results in the literature depend on an expansion in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "we question whether this expansion is sufficiently understood and under control at present .",
    "our model provides an explicit example of how far from the heavy quark limit the charm mass could , in fact , be .",
    "we will later discuss an example of a quantity receiving large @xmath3 corrections , and which also contributes to a measured branching ratio .",
    "one of the prime applications of the heavy quark expansion is in the extraction of @xmath13 from the processes @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the heavy - quark limit @xmath16 ,",
    "these processes are normalized in a model - independent way at zero hadronic recoil .",
    "but for any realistic @xmath17 in our model there are always large positive deviations in at least one of @xmath18 or @xmath19 @xcite , concurrently with rather small deviations in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the large deviations are a sensitive function of the quark masses , and their origin lies in the hyperfine interaction which splits the ground - state pseudoscalar and vector @xmath4 mesons .",
    "this would lead to a discrepancy between the values of @xmath13 extracted from these various processes under the assumption that the deviations from the heavy - quark limit are negligible .    in fig .",
    "1 we show that our model s prediction for the _ shape _ of the decay spectrum of @xmath20 agrees well with the most recent cleo data @xcite .",
    "if we ignored our correction to the overall normalization and forced the heavy - quark limit normalization at zero recoil we would obtain @xmath21 .",
    "our correction to the normalization implies that the actual @xmath13 could be 10% or 15% smaller .",
    "this paper is divided into three parts . in parts",
    "i and ii we describe two major extensions of the model . in part",
    "i we incorporate chiral and gauge symmetries to deal with various processes involving pions and photons .",
    "in particular the ratio @xmath22 is well measured experimentally and provides a sensitive probe to the physics of the light degrees of freedom in the @xmath4 mesons .",
    "this will help constrain the only parameters appearing in our model , the quark masses .",
    "our model reproduces this branching ratio for a choice of quark masses very close to what we have previously used , and in particular it contrains our model @xmath17 to be close to 1.45 gev .",
    "we have observed before that @xmath23 was much more constrained by our model than @xmath24 ; the constraint reads @xmath25 gev ( see the wedge - shaped region in fig",
    ". 6 of @xcite ) . with our new constraint on @xmath17 ,",
    "our model @xmath26 must be close to our previously - used value of 4.8 gev .",
    "one ingredient in our calculation of @xmath27 is the heavy - quark contribution to the @xmath28 coupling .",
    "we find large @xmath3 corrections to this quantity , which are analogous to the large corrections we find in semileptonic @xmath5 decays .",
    "for the @xmath29 and @xmath28 couplings we find values which are one - third as large as the nonrelativistic quark model predictions .",
    "the small @xmath29 coupling has implications for calculations in heavy - quark chiral perturbation theory , and in particular the quantity @xmath30 .",
    "we also include a discussion of charge radii .",
    "we then consider the nonresonant contributions to the processes @xmath31 in the context of the problem of the missing exclusive semileptonic @xmath32 decay modes .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath33 is @xmath34 , while those for the dominant exclusive modes @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the model indicates that the nonresonant contributions play an important role in accounting for the discrepancy .    in part",
    "ii we extend the model to include seven excited charmed mesons .",
    "from the masses ( or estimates of the masses ) of these mesons we are able to determine appropriate model vertex functions .",
    "we calculate and display the various amplitudes for semileptonic @xmath5 meson decays into these excited states .",
    "our results for the various decay widths and electron energy spectra are in qualitative agreement with those of other authors .",
    "we confirm in particular that the decay rates to excited @xmath4 s are too small to account for the above mentioned discrepancy in semileptonic @xmath5 decays .",
    "in part iii we present some details of the heavy - quark limit of the model as it applies to the excited @xmath4 s .",
    "the full - model form factors deviate considerably from their values in the heavy - quark limit , as expected since the masses of these states are significantly greater than the charm - quark mass .",
    "we include the heavy - quark - limit results primarily for comparison with other models .    also in part iii we study two modifications of the model .",
    "we first study the possible modification necessary to describe strange mesons , and in particular the process @xmath39 .",
    "we address the question of whether the @xmath40 should be treated as heavy or light .",
    "and second , we investigate the effect of modifying the form of the momentum damping at the basic quark - antiquark - meson vertex of the model .",
    "we consider an exponential damping factor , and we recover our previous conclusion that there is always a large positive deviation from the heavy - quark limit in one of @xmath41 or @xmath19 .",

    ", our results in other sections do not display such a large sensitivity to quark masses .    in this section",

    "our result is about a factor of three smaller , which mirrors the situation with the pion coupling . in both cases ,",
    "the relevant diagram involves either a vector or axial coupling to the light quark line . the suppression associated with the relativistic nature of the diagram seems to apply to both cases equally .",

    "( @xmath99 is negligible in our model @xcite . )",
    "the deviations from the heavy - quark expansion are much more significant here than they are for the pion and photon couplings to the light quark .",
    "as we have said , these large corrections are analogous to the large @xmath3 corrections we find for @xmath100 .",
    "we now use the above results to extract the @xmath101 and @xmath102 decay widths of the @xmath103 .",

    "for the radiative decay branching fractions we also display the effect of the leading su(3 ) breaking corrections calculated in @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath106 the agreement in the first two columns is a reflection of the quark masses we have chosen .",
    "we consider briefly the implications for the @xmath107-violating quantities @xmath108 it was stressed in @xcite that the measured values , @xmath109 mev and @xmath110 mev , are much smaller than expected from the leading su(3)-breaking one - loop contribution .",

    ", one option is to model the @xmath254 exactly like we model the @xmath103 and @xmath257 mesons .",
    "this would be making the rather suspect assumption that the @xmath40 quark acts like a heavy quark .",
    "the other option , perhaps equally suspect , is to treat the @xmath40 quark as light , on the same footing as the @xmath258 and @xmath259 quarks .",
    "this would entail modifying the vertex damping factor in ( [ damping ] ) in order to treat the @xmath260 and @xmath40 symmetrically .",
    "the damping factor then becomes @xmath261 we will give the results for these two options .    with a strange quark mass of @xmath262 mev",
    ", we find @xmath263 mev and @xmath264 mev .",
    "the relevant observables can be compared to the measured values as follows.@xcite @xmath265 we see that only the branching fraction is very sensitive to how the @xmath40 quark is treated , and interestingly enough , the experimental branching fraction lies between the two extreme ways of treating the @xmath40 .",
    "we may also extract the form factors @xmath266 , @xmath267 and @xmath268 for @xmath131=0 , which may then be compared to nonrelativistic quark model and to sum rule results . for additional models see @xcite .",
    "@xmath269 note that the experimental values here @xcite have been extracted by assuming specific pole expressions for the form factors",
    ". we may compare those form factors to our model form factors by fitting our form factors in the physical region to the pole form @xmath270 .",
    "the values for @xmath271 in gev are the following .",
    "the model relies on a vertex damping factor to suppress the flow of large euclidean momenta through light - quark propagators , and a specific pole form has been chosen.@xmath273 this introduces singularities into our quark loop amplitudes for momenta outside the physical region @xcite .",
    "viewing our amplitudes as functions of the quark masses while keeping the meson masses fixed , there are also cusp - like singularities for special ( presumably unphysical ) values of the quark masses @xcite .",
    "we wish to explore here how our conclusions depend on our choice of the damping factor , and on the singularity structure of the model in particular . to do this we will substitute an exponential form for the damping factor , @xmath274 this may be less realistic for large @xmath275 , but it is free from unphysical singularities at finite @xmath275 .",
    "the parameters @xmath276 and @xmath277 will be determined for each meson from the self - energy graphs , as was done for the quantities @xmath166 and @xmath167 of ( [ ee ] ) .",
    "our standard quark masses imply @xmath278=3.81 , @xmath279=620 mev , @xmath280=2.37 , @xmath281=518 mev , @xmath282=2.96 and @xmath283=785 mev .",
    "the shape of the exponential damping factor is compared to the original damping factor for the @xmath5 meson in fig .",
    "we give the values of the two form factors for @xmath284 which at @xmath238=1 are protected from first order corrections in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "@xmath285 as we have explained elsewhere @xcite , the unphysical procedure of changing the quark masses while holding the meson masses fixed can lead to clearly unphysical values for amplitudes .",
    "the interesting result in the exponential case is the very large corrections to @xmath286 for any reasonable value of @xmath17 .",
    "thus our conclusion regarding the existence of large corrections to the heavy - quark limit in at least one of @xmath287 or @xmath288 @xcite remains unchanged .",
    "we have thoroughly explored a relativistic quark model for hadrons containing one heavy quark .",
    "it is extremely economical in its description of nonperturbative qcd , its only parameters being the quark masses , yet it is consistent with the symmetries of qcd . it displays overall agreement , across a broad range of different processes , with the data when it exists and with more complicated models such as qcd sum rules in the absence of data .",
    "the main difference with other models is the suggestion that large nonperturbative departures from the heavy quark limit occur in certain quantities , most notably in the processes @xmath289 and in the heavy - quark contribution to the @xmath290 coupling . at the same time , it is consistent with data for the shape of the spectrum for @xmath291 and for the branching ratios for @xmath74 . to test the pattern of deviations from the heavy - quark limit in our model and others , we especially encourage efforts to extract and compare @xmath100 from each of @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
