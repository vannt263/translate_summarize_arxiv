    "in a simple quark spectator model , the lifetimes of all @xmath1 hadrons are equal , independent of the flavor of the light quark(s ) bound to the @xmath7 quark .",
    "however , significant non - spectator effects enter in the third order , @xmath8 , and higher order terms in the heavy quark expansion ( hqe )  @xcite of the decay width , leading to the predicted lifetime hierarchy : @xmath9 .",
    "especially , pauli interference terms increase @xmath10 by 5% and @xmath11 by 3% and weak annihilation and exchange reduce @xmath11 by 7% .",
    "recent theoretical calculations predict @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the experimental world averages for these ratios are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath18 and @xmath19 lifetimes are measured precisely at the @xmath1-factories , the experimental uncertainty on @xmath2 lifetime is far higher than the theory uncertainty .",
    "prior to 2006 world average of @xmath20 was small compared to the 3rd order hqe prediction , while the value measured by cdf in 2006  @xcite is precise but larger than previous results .",
    "the doubly heavy @xmath3 meson decay is an interesting laboratory to probe heavy quark dynamics , where both @xmath7 and @xmath21 quarks can decay weakly as well as annihilate . due to significant contributions from @xmath21 quark decay and annihilation process",
    ", the @xmath3 lifetime is expected to be shorter than the light @xmath1 mesons .",
    "current theory predictions for @xmath22 range from 0.47 to 0.59 ps  @xcite .    in this",
    "proceeding we present world best measurements of @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 lifetimes by cdf which will help constrain the theories .",
    "in addition , we present a measurement of @xmath18 lifetime in a decay time biased data sample using a monte carlo independent method .",
    "it significantly reduces systematic uncertainty on lifetime compared to the traditional monte carlo based method and can provide improvements on future measurements of other @xmath1 hadrons .",
    "the @xmath3 lifetime is measured in @xmath23 , @xmath24 semileptonic decay channels  @xcite collected by di - muon trigger in 1.0 fb@xmath0 data . due to the missing neutrino momentum , the observed decay time ( @xmath25 )",
    "is corrected by a @xmath26-factor as follows : @xmath27 where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , extracted from monte carlo .",
    "about 5.6 million signal @xmath30 events were reconstructed .",
    "the main challenge in the analysis comes from various backgrounds which enter due to using a broad partially reconstructed mass shape .",
    "these include real @xmath30 plus misidentified lepton , random track pair consistent to be @xmath30 plus real lepton , real @xmath30 plus real lepton coming from different @xmath7 quarks , prompt @xmath30 plus lepton and residual conversion in @xmath31 decays .",
    "the decay time distribution shape of all backgrounds are modeled and calibrated carefully both from data and monte carlo .",
    "the lifetime is extracted from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit where the signal and background normalizations are fixed and @xmath22 is the only free parameter .",
    "the measured lifetimes from the electron and muon channels are @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the combined result is @xmath34 which is the world best measurement to date .",
    "figure  [ fig : bcctau ] ( left ) shows the combined likelihood as a function of the @xmath35 . combining with the d   measurements  @xcite",
    "the tevatron weighted average is @xmath36 a comparison of our @xmath3 lifetime result with run i cdf and dresults is shown in figure  [ fig : bcctau ] ( right ) .",
    "a good agreement is seen between all the measurements .",
    "the @xmath2 lifetime is measured in the flavor - specific @xmath37 decays  @xcite , with @xmath38 collected using cdf displaced vertex trigger in a 1.3 fb@xmath0 data sample .",
    "in addition to about 1100 fully reconstructed @xmath39 events this analysis uses about 2000 partially reconstructed @xmath40 and @xmath41 events to increase the statistics significantly .",
    "the latter type events involve missing particles ( e.g. a @xmath42 in the @xmath43 mode ) which result in mis - reconstructed mass and transverse momentum .",
    "a @xmath26-factor is introduced to correct the lifetime : @xmath44    the @xmath2 lifetime is determined from two sequential fits .",
    "the first is a binned maximum likelihood fit of the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath39 candidates to determine the signal and background composition .",
    "the second is a unbinned maximum likelihood fit of @xmath45 to extract the @xmath2 lifetime where all the other parameters are fixed .",
    "decay time bias due to trigger acceptance is modeled in the final fit by an efficiency curve , extracted from monte carlo .",
    "extensive tests of the fit procedure have been performed on @xmath18 and @xmath19 control samples which yield lifetime results in good agreement with the corresponding world average values .",

    "a good overall agreement with the pdg 2007  @xcite result is seen .",
    "the @xmath5 lifetime is measured in @xmath47 fully reconstructed decays  @xcite obtained from the cdf displaced vertex trigger where @xmath48 is reconstructed from its decay to a proton , kaon and a pion .",
    "about 2900 signal events are reconstructed from a data sample of 1.1 fb@xmath0 .",
    "a blind analysis is performed where all analysis procedures are finalized with the signal region ( @xmath49 } \\rm{gev}/c^2 $ ] in data blinded . as in section  [ bslife ]",
    "a two - step fit of invariant mass and lifetime is performed to extract the @xmath5 lifetime .",
    "as before , the trigger efficiency curve , obtained from monte carlo , is introduced in the lifetime fit to model decay time bias .",
    "the fit procedure is validated using input lifetime ( @xmath50 ) values in monte carlo between 325 and 500 @xmath51 m .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbctau ] ( left ) shows the lifetime fit projection .",
    "we measure the @xmath5 lifetime @xmath52 this is the current world best measurement . using world average @xmath19 lifetime  @xcite",
    "we obtain @xmath53 the leading sources of systematic error to this measurement come from modeling of the displaced vertex trigger , @xmath54 dalitz structure and decay time distribution of combinatorial background .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbctau ] ( right ) compares this result with the current world average and all measurements contributing to it , where a good agreement is seen .",
    "this result is also compatible with the hqe prediction of the lifetime ratio , @xmath20 .",
    "the cdf displaced vertex trigger provides heavy - flavor enriched data sample crucial for many @xmath1 physics analyses , two of which are presented in sections  [ bslife ] and [ lblife ] .",
    "the decay time distributions from this sample are biased which @xmath2 and @xmath5 lifetime analyses correct for , employing monte carlo based efficiency functions .",
    "this method , however , serves as the dominant source of systematic error in both these analyses .",
    "a monte carlo independent method has been developed which exploits the decay kinematics in data to correct for the trigger bias on a per event basis .",
    "it completely avoids monte carlo modeling of the trigger effect and thus promises to improve uncertainty involved in future lifetime measurements in trigger biased samples .    as a proof of principle",
    ", we present a measurement of @xmath18 lifetime measured in the fully reconstructed @xmath55 decays  @xcite .",
    "about 24200 signal events are reconstructed in 1 fb@xmath0 data .",
    "the cdf displaced vertex trigger requires a pair of tracks with large impact parameters .",

    "a fisher discriminant analysis is performed to transform the acceptance into a variable which is easier to handle .",
    "the following three step method is adopted to extract the @xmath18 lifetime .",
    "firstly the mass distribution is fitted which defines the signal and sideband regions and provides the sample composition .",
    "secondly , using the signal and sideband regions the fisher variable is computed from the trigger acceptance .",
    "finally a maximum likelihood fit is performed on the lifetime and the signal dependent fisher variable to extract the lifetime .",

    "we measure the @xmath18 lifetime @xmath56 this is in good agreement with the current world average of @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the small systematic error of this measurement makes the monte carlo independent method promising for future lifetime measurements of , e.g. @xmath2 and @xmath5 hadrons .",
    "the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties are impact parameter and transverse momentum dependence of track finding efficiency and correlation betwen mass and decay time in the background .",
    "using data samples in excess of 1 fb@xmath0 collected by the cdf detector we present world best measurements of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 hadron lifetimes .",
    "they are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental world averages and hqe predictions .",
    "a monte carlo independent method is used to measure the @xmath18 lifetime in a trigger biased data sample which agrees with the current world average and is expected to be used in future measurements of other @xmath1 hadron lifetimes .",
    "it is to be noted that all the measurements presented in this proceeding are from about 1/4@xmath58 of the current cdf dataset .",
    "we expect significant improvements to these results in the near future as more data are analyzed ."
