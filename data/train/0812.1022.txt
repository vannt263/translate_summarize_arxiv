    "in the current era of observational astronomy the size of galaxy datasets means that number statistics starts to lose its spot as number one source of uncertainty in galaxy evolution studies . with the availability of large wide field galaxy surveys as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ? * ) or 2df galaxy redshift survey , and the deep , space based high resolution projects like the hubble ultra deep field , goods , gems and stages projects and the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) with their @xmath9 to @xmath10 galaxies , other error sources become vital to understand .",
    "if we want to understand the buildup of galaxies with their intricately linked evolution in stellar and black hole mass , luminosities , colors , morphological types , and the alternations between interaction and relaxation , we have to understand what the tools we apply really measure .",
    "any given galaxy will look different when viewed with different instruments or when located at different redshifts , due to cosmological dimming and changes in rest - frame bandpass .",
    "this makes the qualitative or quantitative classification of e.g.  galaxy morphology non - trivial to compare for different redshifts or filters .",
    "as one example faint disks visible at one redshift will fade from the observer s view at larger distances , not only affecting eyeball - classifications of morphology but also automatic classifier software .",
    "moreover , low surface brightness signs of interaction and structures , such as bars which are not prominent in the rest - frame ultraviolet , will not be visible at higher redshfits .    if the evolution of galaxies is to be studied via merger statistics , morphology - segregated evolution , star formation histories , and type - specific luminosity functions , all morphological classifiers have to be calibrated to deliver comparisons of similar quantities at all redshifts , taking into account bandpass - dependent properties and changes in signal - to - noise ratio .    from the analysis of hst survey data",
    "we know that the average surface brightness of the disc galaxy population fades with time ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the change is approximately 1 - 1.5mag depending on rest - frame bandpass over the redshift interval @xmath11 . to some degree",
    "this surface brightness evolution counters the cosmological dimming and helps detecting low surface brightness features .",
    "thus , if this effect is not taken into account , predictions about the recoverability of structural parameters or classifications are overly pessimistic .",
    "for a few projects in the past , codes were created that would include some of these effects for specific applications or datasets ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ". however , to our knowledge no codes or datasets that include geometrical and cosmological bandpass shifting effects are currently publicly available . in the present article",
    "we describe the creation of artificial image data sets in the range @xmath0 , computed from low-@xmath8 sdss galaxies by artificial `` redshifting '' .",
    "since we refrain from adding any evolutionary models but purely apply cosmological changes in angular size , surface brightness and filter bandpass , this dataset shows exactly how such galaxies will appear when observed from cosmological distances , at which redshift certain features become undetectable , and any quantitative classifier procedure can be tested for dependency on redshift effects .",
    "our code ferengi , `` full and efficient redshifting of ensembles of nearby galaxy images '' , and the present datasets were originally created for the morphological classification of active and inactive galaxies in the gems @xcite , stages @xcite , and cosmos @xcite projects .",
    "the datasets for the hst acs image characteristics of the gems and cosmos project are freely available from our website . as many studies might benefit from such data we also make the ferengi  code available on the same webpage for others to use with different input samples , redshifts , and instrument characteristics .    in the following",
    "we describe the input data in section  [ sec : input ] , the redshifting procedure including the basic cosmological formulae that enter , and the bandpass shift in section  [ sec : redshifting ] , and the creation of realistic images from this information in section  [ sec : noise ] including example results ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "next , we present a series of tests characterising the robustness and accuracy of the code ( section  [ sec : tests ] ) . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss limitations of this procedure .    all examples and cosmology - dependent numbers given here are computed assuming a flat universe with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the basic idea is to convert images of well resolved , low - redshift galaxies to images simulating the same galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "input and output images can differ in assumed redshift , pixel size , point spread function ( psf ) and noise properties .",
    "we explicitely compute two versions , with and without luminosity / surface brightness evolution terms .",
    "when purely considering instrumental and cosmological effects , users of such datasets can apply his or her tools to the exactly same galaxies , only located at different redshifts for calibration purposes . when including evolution , more realistic galaxies are created . for the current study",
    "we have implemented a linear scaling with redshift to make sources brighter at high redshift .",
    "for this project we require input galaxy data with two main properties : i ) sufficient sampling : the combination of distance to the galaxy , pixel size and width of the psf must be sufficient for the target pixel size and psf width at the lowest target redshift ( e.g.  @xmath14 ) .",
    "ii ) information about the spectral energy distribution : the task needs homogeneous multiband imaging used for interpolation between filters to compute fluxes in the target filter band at the desired redshift without extrapolation .",
    "the best source for such data are nearby galaxies from the sdss .",
    "this survey provides imaging data in its own @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 filters with 0396/pixel sampling .",
    "we compute the maximum distance for input galaxies from the two requirement to i ) simulate images with 005 and 003 pixel size at a minimum redshift of @xmath15 , and ii ) to have an output psf not already broader than the @xmath16 ( fwhm ) psf of the acs wfc drizzled images in the f606w or f814w filters .",
    "figure  [ fig : sampleselection ] shows the resulting limit in @xmath17 and the limit from the width of the psf for a sample of sdss galaxies and their psf conditions .",
    "both criteria select a similar set of galaxies , corresponding to limiting recession velocities of @xmath18 and @xmath19  kms@xmath3 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , and @xmath22 output pixel size . for pixel size 005 the limits change to @xmath23 and @xmath24  kms@xmath3 .",
    "these technical aspects define the boundary conditions of our sample selection .",
    "we emphasise that at this point we do not aim to select a sample that is complete or representative for the general population of galaxies in a statistical sense .",
    "the sample selection only intends to span a large range of morphological types and common features , targeting large , rather luminous galaxies that could still be observed at larger @xmath8 .    with this intention",
    "we make a selection of galaxies from the sdss survey area , via the hyperleda @xcite catalogue facility , with the following parameters : recession velocity @xmath25 corrected for virgo infall ( 208 kms@xmath3 ) , apparent isophotal diameter @xmath26 arcmin , and apparent magnitude @xmath27 , and added a total @xmath28-band magnitude cut at @xmath29",
    ".    images were taken from the data release 4 ( dr4 ) of the sdss @xcite .",
    "as the sdss imaging data is not targeted on individual galaxies , a fraction of about 40% of the selected galaxies extends beyond the borders of the 680@xmath30590 arcsec@xmath31 sdss field of view .",
    "we excluded such galaxies as input after visual inspection .    in total we selected a sample of 96  galaxies with @xmath32 km  s@xmath3 and very heterogeneous morphologies .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample ] shows the hubble diagram of the input sample . in the same figure and in table  [ tab : sample ] we give the distribution of morphological classification according to the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _",
    "( rc3 , * ? ? ? * ) to illustrate the sample composition .",
    "note , that the class `` peculiar '' was manually selected for showing signs of ongoing mergers , or close or overlapping galaxies .",
    "lc class&number of galaxies + e & 5 + s0 & 8 + early s & 16 + late s & 40 + irr & 5 + pec & 22 +    as in the local universe few galaxies show strong signs of interactions or even mergers , we gradually extended our selection range from @xmath33 out to @xmath32 .",
    "at larger distances we only included `` peculiar''-looking sources like strong interactions or mergers .",
    "however , we also included some unrelated objects that have small projected radii or even overlap .",
    "our intention here was to demonstrate the increasing difficulty at high redshift to morphologically discern interaction from projection effects .",
    "the ferengi  redshifting procedure has two components , cosmological angular size and surface brightness changes on one side and bandpass shifting on the other .",
    "after computation of these cosmological effects we correct for psf effects and add noise .      when converting from an input image with pixel size @xmath34 of a galaxy at redshift @xmath35 to an output redshift @xmath36 and desired pixel size @xmath37 both angular sizes and surface brightnesses have to be modified for distance and cosmological effects . using @xmath38 for small angles , the angular size @xmath39 of a given linear dimension changes as @xmath40 with the luminosity distance @xmath41 .",
    "since the input image will be rebinned to the output pixel size , angular sizes in units of pixels @xmath42 , and thus image rebinning factors , are @xmath43    the flux in each pixel is subject to surface brightness dimming .",
    "if we require the galaxy absolute magnitude to be conserved @xmath44 we find a relation for the ratio of observed fluxes @xmath45 of the in- and output images @xmath46 which gives the standard bolometric surface brightness dependence of @xmath47 .",
    "the finite filter width is taken care of in the next component .",
    "note , that in order to account for the bandpass shift it is imperative to match object positions in the input images .",
    "this matching is a complex process , which potentially includes shifting , rotation and scaling of the input data .",
    "moreover , the psfs of the data should match . in the case of strongly varying psfs colour terms",
    "may be introduced in the bandpass shifting .",
    "when combining e.g.  galex and sdss data , to extend the wavelength baseline to the uv , the users would have to prepare the input image accordingly .",
    "they have to shift all images to a common position , scale the galex image to the sdss pixel scale , possibly rotate the galex image to match the sdss frame and smooth all sdss images to the galex fwhm .",
    "the so - processed images are then input to ferengi .",
    "thus , preparing the input appropriately , ferengi  is not limited in the combination of telescopes , filters , or instruments .",
    "while the above rebinning and flux rescaling takes care of all geometrical effects , bandpass shifting and stretching still has to be added .",
    "the cosmological redshift will ( by definition ) shift the observed restframe bandpass for a given observing filter as a function of redshift as well as change the size of a given filter .",
    "in addition we want to have the option to produce images for a range of optical observed filters .    for this task we input spectral information in the form of multiband imaging .",
    "a combination of observers filter and redshift defines the desired rest - frame filter curve . for each pixel of the input frame",
    "we calculate the expected flux for this rest - frame filter , by interpolating between multiband information on this pixel .",
    "this task is facilitated by the routine k_correct(v4.14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* available for idl and c ) that was written to fit spectral templates to a set of multiband images .",
    "we use k_correct  to determine a best template for individual pixels in an image , and from this the flux in each pixel for a given filter .",
    "we so construct a rest - frame filter image . this bandpass shift and the above size - rebinning are interchangeable in order . to minimize the computational effort and to reduce noise we first recomputed the ( coarser ) redshifted images and then applied the bandpass shift .",
    "also , only pixels with flux exceeding 2 times the rms of the background are input to k_correct  ( optional feature ) .",
    "the remaining pixels receive a flux - weighted @xmath48-correction computed from the bright pixels . while this could become more important at low s / n levels , it showed not to have a significant effect for the currently chosen bright sample of galaxies .",
    "note , the template set incorporated in k_correct  stems from @xcite models .",
    "these model templates cover the rest - frame wavelength range from uv to ir ( 600  to 320@xmath49 m ) . as long as the input filters together with the targeted output redshift fall within this range any combination is possible .",
    "two essential ingredients for realistic images are i ) to mimic the resolution of the real data by convolution with an appropriate psf and ii ) to generate realistic noise levels for galaxy and background .",
    "the input sdss galaxies were observed under varying seeing conditions with an average psf width of 14 fwhm corresponding to @xmath13.5 sdss camera pixel .",
    "after application of the redshifting procedure the intrinsic psf is of finite width and non - negligible . while for point- or composite sources as type  i agn the detailed knowledge about the psf is essential , the requirements are not so stringent for extended galaxies",
    "however , as the simulated dataset is meant to calibrate quantitative morphological analysis methods and programs , it is important to create a psf that is sufficiently similar to the real psf for the task in question .    in light of this",
    "we attempt to reach a final psf as close as possible in shape and width to the acs psf in the desired band .",
    "this involves the creation of a convolution kernel that will produce the acs psf shape from the input psf shape .",
    "as the width and geometric shrinking of the psf depends both on input and target redshift , and the input psf varies , this kernel needs to be recomputed for each input galaxy and output redshift .",
    "this is done by a transformation into fourier space , suppression of noise by wiener filtering , and subsequent division of the spectra of the two psfs .",
    "after transformation of this quotient back into the spatial domain we receive the function that is needed to convolve the input image to reach a psf close to the acs psf .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to a deconvolution of the output psf with the desired input psf . for the comparably high s / n psf in these data",
    "this works fairly well .",
    "note , that the filter of the input psf is chosen from the set of sdss filters minimising the wavelength difference to the desired rest - frame band , thus also minimising colour gradients in the reconstructed psf .",
    "however the seeing is wavelength dependent and can also vary on the short timescales between the integration in the different sdss filter bands .",
    "this can still result in small differences between the actual psf present for a reconstructed galaxy image and the reconstructed psf image . in order to remove this wavelength dependency",
    "we choose a well sampled , not saturated star in each sdss filter as psf .",
    "we convolve the sdss images with a kernel ( as described above ) that generates a round gaussian psf with a fwhm for all filters of 1.1@xmath30 the largest extent of the input psfs .",
    "thus , psf resolution effects and colour gradients are kept at an absolute minimum .",
    "a comparison of the reconstructed and target acs psf shows a difference of less than 0.1% in each individual pixel .",
    "this procedure is limited to cases where the widths of in- and output psf are sufficiently different . if not",
    ", noise will introduce artifacts as ringing patterns or mathematical ghost images near bright sources , which is clearly not desirable .",
    "this occurs primarily when the input psf resolution becomes comparable to the output psf width ",
    "so the convolution function becomes very narrow ",
    "i.e.  at the low redshift end .",
    "in order to facilitate proper modelling of the redshifted galaxy images we discourage the use of the publicly available gems or cosmos psf , but suggest to prefer the reconstructed psf instead .",
    "although this might not be crucial for determining two - dimensional galaxy light profiles , it might make a significant difference in the case of agns and their host galaxies .",
    "likewise , we recommend using scaled versions of the reconstructed psf to be put on top of redshifted galaxy images in order to create artificial agns .",
    "noise in the output images has two main sources , sky background and the galaxy flux itself . for one - orbit exposures as for cosmos and gems the sky background noise dominates over the readout noise ( @xmath15.2  @xmath50 for the acs wide - field camera ) after a few 100 seconds of integration , in the case of broad band filters .",
    "thus the latter is negligible .",
    "also , at 0.0022  @xmath50  @xmath51 the acs / wfc dark current does not play a significant role .",
    "the background noise in our simulations is not created from random numbers , but the noise - added galaxy images are added onto blank sky taken from the observed data itself ( for acs data reduction for gems and cosmos see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this way reduction signatures like correlated noise and intrinsic small variations in the otherwise empty regions of the sky are also present in the simulated data .",
    "we extract several 60@xmath52 square fields from the data . while we choose comparably empty regions of the sky , the acs camera is so efficient over one orbit for both the cosmos and gems filters that there exists no `` empty '' sky over more than 1020@xmath52 regions .",
    "to remove prominent remaining objects we replace the corresponding pixel regions with unique other small patches of blank sky .",
    "this process does not involve any filtering , only replacing . in this way the resulting empty sky fields are very good random representations of empty sky regions .",
    "if for an application the sensitivity of a measurement to small residual back-/foreground objects is to be tested , the user can add his / her favorite contamination or even use random patches of uncleaned sky as background .",
    "noise has to be added also to the redshifted galaxy images themselves .",
    "the s / n per pixel of the input galaxies is high by definition of the sample .",
    "after redshifting and psf adaptation their photon noise is negligible compared to the noise expected from a single orbit hst acs exposure .",
    "the resulting images are scaled in flux corresponding to e.g.  2028 seconds ( cosmos ) integration time , in the respective output filter . the galaxy image  in units of electrons per pixel  then has random poisson noise added , with a @xmath53 corresponding to the galaxy flux per pixel .",
    "subsequently , the galaxy is added on top of the empty background images . in a statistical sense",
    "this procedure is not strictly correct , as the photon noise addition should be applied to the sum of sky and galaxy , but can not be avoided if real sky images are to be used .",
    "however , the resulting higher noise only appears in regions of the final image where sky background and galaxy contribute equally in noise , so in the faint isophote regime of the galaxy .",

    "as the performed calculations are virtually identical any differences in the output must result from irregularities in the real data , such as tidal features , spiral arms , dust lanes , etc .",
    "the example galaxy was chosen to be rather featureless . therefore , a perfect match is obtained . yet , in the majority of cases we find systematic differences : either redshift dependent deviations ( originating from irregularities ) or global shifts towards higher or lower values . at the highest redshift ( @xmath69 )",
    "the impact of morphology might decrease again as virtually all features are smeared out .",
    "yet , the reason for global offsets is of technical nature : the drastic change in resolution and depth when transforming a low redshift image ( @xmath17 of a few thousand km / h ) to high redshift ( @xmath70 ) results in the rebinned psf not being nyquist sampled any more .",
    "this causes shifts when performing fourier transformations .",
    "the effect is more pronounced at low ( @xmath70 ) than at high ( @xmath69 ) redshift , because eventually the psf becomes pointlike .",
    "we applied ferengi  to all 96  sample galaxies .",
    "this allows us to quantify systematic biases of the redshifting code in some detail . in figure",
    "[ fig : mean01 ] we show the average deviation from the input values for simulations of high redshift galaxies and downscaled versions of simulated galaxies ( no .  2 & 3 from table  [ tab : tests ] ) .",
    "the errors and systematic offsets are not significantly different . for the given observational setup ( redshifting of sdss images to cosmos and gems ) roughly at @xmath71 larger deviations in particular in @xmath4-band occur .",
    "note , that these depatures from the expected mean are seen in the simulated images as well .",
    "therefore , they must originate from the specific galfit  setup , but not ferengi  itself .    in order to compare the results of the high redshift simulations and the downscaling - only simulations ( no .  2 & 3 from table  [ tab : tests ] ) with the @xmath48-corrections - enabled setup ( no .",
    "4 ) , we plot as a function of redshift the measurements in the sdss filters closest to the rest - frame acs filter ( figure  [ fig : mean02 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the error bars in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mean02 ] ( no .  4 ) at the highest two redshift bins are _ smaller _ than without @xmath48-corrections ( no .",
    "3 ) or even in the pure simulations ( no .  2 ) .",
    "the reason for this is , that the sed fitting uses all five sdss bands and therefore introduces some information extrapolated from @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the closer bands being weighted more strongly than the redder bands ) to improve the low s / n @xmath4-band data .",
    "however , this implies also that template mismatches might change the morphological appearance of the object to some extent . as the sed - fitting code",
    "is deeply embedded in k_correct  we do not attempt to characterise the impact any further .",
    "moreover , we find , that the @xmath48-correction code on average introduces stronger fluctuations and increases the error bars slightly at lower redshifts . systematic deviations to lower brightnesses , radii or srsic  indices are not statistically significant .",
    "we take from figures  [ fig : mean01 ] and [ fig : mean02 ] that ferengi  has no unwanted systematic effects on measured morphological and photometrical parameters of simulated galaxies . the deviations from theoretical values",
    "are well within the uncertainties expected from , in this case , galfit , also in absolute terms .",
    "both linear scales as well as magnitudes are well reproduced .",
    "this includes the bandpass shifts induced by redshifting and different filters , as is demonstrated in the right panels in figures  [ fig : mean02 ] : the k_correct  module correctly interpolates between input filter images .",
    "we can not exclude issues when _ extrapolating _",
    "k_correct  templates , but we explicitly restrict the output range of redshifts to only use template _ interpolation _ , between bands .",
    "we make ferengi  publically available from our webpage , as are redshifted sets of images for redshifts @xmath72 and different hst acs filters .",
    "primarily these are created for the gems ( f606w and f850lp at 003/pixel ) and cosmos ( f814w at 005/pixel ) projects , but the code can be modified and used for other filters .",
    "the user can extend the input sample of images ( also provided on the webpage ) , to other objects , filter curves , and output redshifts , and in principle also to other data sources .",
    "we leave it up to the user to update ferengi  with respect to the @xmath48-correction module when including other input filter bands .",
    "as stated , templates are used for interpolation between input filters .",
    "they can theoretically also be extrapolated beyond the input wavelength interval , if one has faith in the templates .",
    "however , we strongly advise against this for a different reason : due to the limited s / n available for the pixel - by - pixel @xmath48-correction that is computed , a mild extrapolation might be acceptable , but the noise of the output pixels and systematic deviations will obviously increase with distance to the last supported wavelength . as various templates might be degenerate when interpolating , there might be striking differences on extrapolation , resulting in large errors in the output flux .    as a second caveat we note that stars in the input images are not treated separately in ferengi  or in the provided datasets .",
    "_ any _ flux in the input images , be it stars or back-/foreground galaxies , will be treated as if it were at the distance of the target and thus be redshifted .",
    "while distant background galaxies usually disappear , stars will be represented with the output psf , resembling a faint dense star field ( the density of stars is enhanced quadratically with decreasing linear scales as the simulation redshift increases ) .",
    "of even greater concern are foreground ( or closer background ) galaxies . in the output , their physical properties",
    "are calculated falsely as their assumed distance is not correct . whether the resulting images will in the end be reliable representations of reality , strongly depends on the quality of input images , the type of galaxies , and their correspondence with the templates used .",
