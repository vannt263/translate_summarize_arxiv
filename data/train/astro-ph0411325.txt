    "wide - area x - ray surveys have played a key role in understanding the nature of the sources that populate the x - ray universe .",
    "early surveys like the @xmath10 medium sensitivity survey @xcite , rosat ( roentgen satellite ) international x - ray / optical survey @xcite and the asca ( advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ) large sky survey @xcite showed that the vast majority of the x - ray sources were agn .",
    "in particular , in shallow wide area surveys in the soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) x - ray band , most of the sources detected are unobscured , broad line agn , which are characterized by a soft x - ray spectrum with a photon index as the exponent giving a photon flux density x - ray spectrum @xmath11 in photons @xmath9  s@xmath2  kev@xmath2 ] @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "more recent , deeper observations , mostly by rosat @xcite , xmm - newton and @xmath0 @xcite , that resolved between 70% and 90% of the x - ray background ( xrb ) showed that the vast majority of this background radiation can be attributed to agn .",
    "however , the spectrum of the xrb is well characterized up to @xmath14  kev by a power law with photon index @xmath15 @xcite , harder than the typical unobscured agn spectrum @xcite .",
    "given that photoelectric extinction preferentially absorbs soft x - ray photons @xcite , the x - ray spectra of obscured agn look harder and therefore more compatible with the observed spectral shape of the xrb .",
    "therefore , population synthesis models @xcite that can explain the spectral shape and normalization of the xrb use a combination of obscured and unobscured agn as the major contributor . in these models ,",
    "the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn is about 4:1 @xcite with a redshift peak at @xmath16 .",
    "however , recent deep optical spectroscopic follow up in the @xmath0 deep fields ( cdf ) north @xcite and south @xcite revealed a much lower redshift peak at @xmath17 and an obscured to unobscured agn ratio of @xmath18 2:1 .",
    "while large observational efforts have been concentrated in the chandra deep fields , which provide the deepest view of the x - ray universe ( e.g. , a flux limit of @xmath19  ergs  @xmath9s@xmath2 on the cdf - n ) , the small area covered ( @xmath20 deg@xmath21 each ) does not allow them to obtain a statistically significant number of sources in the intermediate x - ray flux range ( @xmath1 ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 ) that contributes @xmath18 60 - 70% of the xrb .",
    "therefore , we obtained identifications and studied the multiwavelength properties of x - ray sources in this flux range over a much larger area .    specifically , in 2001 we started the caln - yale deep extragalactic research ( cyder ) survey , a multiwavelength study of serendipitous x - ray sources in existing , archived , moderately deep @xmath0 fields .",
    "initial results from the first two fields studied were presented by @xcite .",
    "also , two high - redshift ( @xmath22 ) x - ray selected quasars discovered in this survey , a significant fraction of the total sample known today ( @xmath1810 ) , were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "near infrared images in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands were obtained for these fields up to @xmath25 and @xmath26 mags ( vega ) .",
    "the results of combining x - ray / optical and near infrared observations for our sample of serendipitous x - ray sources will be presented in a following paper ( f. castander et al , in prep ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present optical photometry for 267 x - ray sources selected in the @xmath0 total band ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) in the five fields studied by the cyder survey .",
    "also , spectroscopic identifications and redshifts for 106 x - ray sources are presented .",
    "the sample presented here is comparable in multiwavelength follow - up to deeper , more famous , surveys like the cdfs and the lockman hole .",
    "spectroscopic identifications were obtained for sources with relatively faint optical fluxes ( @xmath27 mag ) , allowing for a more unbiased study of the x - ray population and showing that the statistical properties of the sample depends significantly on the depth of the spectroscopic follow - up . also , the use of five different fields spread over the sky allows to reduce the effects of cosmic variance , that affected the results of single - field studies , e.g. , the presence of clusters in the cdf - s @xcite .    in   [ xray_data ]",
    "we explain the criteria used to select the x - ray fields studied and the procedures followed to reduce the x - ray data and to extract sources lists . in   [ opt_data ] we describe the optical imaging and spectroscopy observations and the data reduction methods used . in   [ source_prop ] we present source properties in each wavelength range .",
    "our results are discussed in   [ disc ] and the conclusions outlined in   [ conc ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath28  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , consistent with the cosmological parameters reported by @xcite .",
    "fields in the cyder survey were selected based on existing deep @xmath0 observations available in the public archive before the optical imaging campaign started in late 2000 .",
    "the fields are observable from the southern hemisphere , are at high galactic latitude ( @xmath31 ) in order to minimize dust extinction , avoiding targeting known clusters given the difficulties in dealing with a diffuse non - uniform background . only observations with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) were used . in the case of acis - i observations",
    "all four ccds were used while for observations in the acis - s mode only the s3 and s4 chips were used in order to keep the off - axis angle small and therefore only use zones with good sensitivity .",
    "fields selected for this study are presented in table [ fields ] . in two of these fields ,",
    "c2 and d2 , the original target of the observation was a galaxy group . in these cases ,",
    "the galaxy group diffuse emission reduces the sensitivity in the centers of the regions , but not dramatically .",
    "roughly the central @xmath32 radius region for hcg 62 has substantial gas emission , while the @xmath33 central region was affected by the presence of hcg 90 .",
    "this accounts for about 2% of the hcg 62 region and a slightly smaller fraction of the hcg 90 region , since the latter was observed with acis - i .",
    "the effective area of field c5 was set to 0 since the chandra images of that field were read in subraster mode to include only the central source , and therefore serendipitous sources detected on that field were ignored to compute the @xmath3 relation .",
    "some of our fields were also studied by other similar surveys . in particular , the q2345 and sbs 0335 fields were analyzed by the chandra multiwavelength project ( champ ; @xcite ) while the hcg 62 and q2345 fields were studied by the serendipitous extragalactic x - ray source identification program ( sexsi ; @xcite ) .",
    "reduction of the data included the removal of bad columns and pixels using the guidelines specified on the `` acis recipes : clean the data '' web page and the removal of flaring pixels using the flagflare routine .",
    "we used the full set of standard event grades ( 0,2,3,4,6 ) and created two images , one from 0.5 to 2.0 kev and one from 2.0 to 8.0 kev .",
    "then , we used the wavdetect routine from the ciao package to identify the point sources within these images , checking wavelet scales 1,2,4,8 and 16 .",
    "sources were extracted independently in the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and hard ( 2.0 - 8.0 kev ) band images . the false source detection probability is set to @xmath34 for acis - s observations and @xmath35 for acis - i observations .",
    "this gives a likelihood of @xmath36 false source detection per field observed .",
    "given the low density of x - ray sources and the good spatial resolution of chandra , matching sources in the soft and hard bands was straightforward .",
    "where the x - ray spectrum had at least 60 counts , the photons were binned in groups of 20 , and the spectrum was fit in xspec 11.0 , using a model consisting of a power law with the appropriate galactic absorption value for each field .",
    "where the number of counts was smaller than 60 , the same procedure was used , except that the spectral index was fixed to @xmath371.7 , consistent with the hardening of the x - ray spectrum with decreasing flux @xcite .",
    "optical images were obtained using the ctio 4-m blanco telescope in chile with the mosaic - ii camera @xcite , which has a field of view of @xmath38 .",
    "details of the optical observations are presented in table [ opt_sum ] .",
    "all the fields have optical coverage in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 filters in the optical , and were also imaged in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands in the near infrared , observations that will be reported in a following publication .",
    "reduction of the data was performed using standard procedures included in iraf v 2.12 , in particular in the mscred package .",
    "the data reduction scheme followed was based on the recipe used by the noao deep wide survey .",
    "standard calibration images ( bias and dome flats ) were obtained each night for every filter used .",
    "super - sky flats were constructed based on several ( @xmath18 20 ) unregistered frames in each filter , masking real objects in order to obtain a secondary flat field image . once basic calibrations were performed , individual frames were registered and co - added to obtain the final image in each filter .",
    "astrometric solutions for each final image were calculated based on the usno catalog .",
    "typical astrometric uncertainties are @xmath39  , smaller than the on - axis psf size of @xmath0 images , therefore allowing for an accurate match between optical and x - ray data .",
    "objects in the final images were extracted using sextractor @xcite . to detect objects we used a threshold of 1.5@xmath40 above the background per pixel and a minimum area of 15 pixels ( @xmath41  arcsec@xmath42 ) above that threshold . in several experiments ,",
    "this combination of parameters gave a good balance between completeness and false detections , the latter being lower than @xmath18 5% , for the range of fwhm of our images .",
    "zero points for each image were obtained independently for each night based on observations of landolt standard fields @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed using a diameter of 1.4 times the fwhm .",
    "magnitudes were later corrected for the ( small ) effects of galactic extinction in our high - galactic latitude fields . limiting magnitude for each image",
    "was calculated based on global rms measurements of the background and reported in table [ opt_sum ] .",
    "objects in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 images were matched by position allowing a maximum distance of 1@xmath43 between objects in different filters .",
    "the typical difference between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 counterparts is @xmath44 , consistent with the previously reported astrometric uncertainties and typical centroid errors , so the choice of 1@xmath43 as a threshold provides a good balance in order to avoid spurious matches .",
    "if more than one match was found inside that area then the closest match was used , however this only happened in a few cases given the typical sky density of our optical images .",
    "@xmath45 color was calculated for sources detected in both bands .",
    "given that one of the goals of cyder is the study of the optically faint x - ray population , only 8-m class telescopes were used for the spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "multi - object spectrographs were used in order to improve the efficiency of the observations , including fors2 at the vlt in mxu mode and the ldss-2 instrument on the magellan i ( baade ) telescope .",
    "details of these observations are given in table [ spec_sum ] .",
    "given the space density of x - ray sources at our flux limit and the field of view of the instruments used , typically @xmath188 x - ray sources were observed per mask . for the observations with fors2 at the vlt ,",
    "the 300v-20 grism was used , which gives a resolution @xmath46 ( 10.5 ) for our 1  slits , with a typical wavelength coverage from @xmath47  depending on the position of the source in the mask .",
    "observations with ldss-2 used the med / blue grism , giving a dispersion of 5.3  pixel@xmath2 at a central wavelength of 5500  and resolution of @xmath48350 with our 1.0  wide slits .",
    "the typical wavelength coverage with this configuration was @xmath49  .",
    "spectral reduction was performed using standard iraf tasks called by a customized version of the bogus codestern / homepage / bogus.html ] .",
    "we calibrated the wavelength of the spectrum using he - ar comparison lamps and the night - sky lines . in",
    "order to flux - calibrate our spectra , @xmath50 spectrophotometric standards were observed every night .",
    "the full catalog of x - ray sources in the cyder field is presented in the on - line version of the journal , while for clarity a fraction of the catalog is presented in table  [ catalog ] .",
    "the full catalog is also available on - line at http://www.astro.yale.edu / treister / cyder/. coordinates are given as measured in the x - ray image , while the offset is calculated with respect to the closest optical counterpart and only reported when this offset is smaller than 2.5  and thus that counterpart was used in the analysis .",
    "when a counterpart was not detected in the optical images , the @xmath51 upper limit in that band is reported . in order to convert count rates into fluxes , the procedure described in section ",
    "2.2 was followed .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity was computed only for sources with spectroscopic identification and measured redshift .",
    "this luminosity was calculated in the observed frame without accounting for k - corrections or correcting for absorption .",
    "therefore , the simple formula @xmath52 was used .",
    "a total of 37 x - ray sources were detected in the c2 field , with a total ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) x - ray flux ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 . in the c5 field",
    "only 5 x - ray sources were detected above @xmath55  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) since only the s3 ccd was read and in subraster mode . in the d1 , d2 and d3 fields 93 , 47 and 85 x - ray sources were detected respectively , with a total ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) x - ray flux ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 .",
    "the area covered as a function of limiting flux in the hard x - ray flux band was first estimated individually for each field using the portable , interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the complexities associated with the modeling of the varying psf as a function of off - axis angle and the presence of diffuse emission in most of these fields that makes the problem of estimating the completeness levels even harder a constant , higher , flux limit was used for each field .",
    "specifically , for each field we used a fixed value of 2.5 times the flux of the faintest source included in the catalog for each field , in order to be sure that the sample is complete up to that flux .",
    "this roughly corresponds to 20 counts detected in the hard band for acis - s observations and 10 counts for fields observed with the acis - i ccds .",
    "the flux limit in the hard band assumed for each field is shown on table [ fields ] .",
    "the resulting total area of the survey is @xmath58deg@xmath59 , with a minimum flux limit of @xmath60  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 ( 2 - 8 kev ) .",
    "figure  [ area ] shows the resulting area versus flux limit curve , in comparison to other surveys like the great observatories origin deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) and sexsi @xcite .",
    "the cumulative flux distribution was calculated using @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the observed hard x - ray flux of the @xmath63-th source and @xmath64 is the maximum area over which that source could be detected . the resulting @xmath3 relation for the cyder sample",
    "is shown in figure  [ logn_cum ] .",
    "this curve is consistent with the relation computed by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the lower panel of fig  [ logn_cum ]",
    "we show the residuals after comparing with the relation computed by @xcite using a combination of observational data in both shallow wide - field and deep pencil beam x - ray surveys , showing that the agreement is good .",
    "one significant problem with the cumulative @xmath3 relation is that the errors in each bin are not independent .",
    "the differential flux distribution can be used to avoid this problem .",
    "this relation can be expressed as : @xmath65 where in this case the sample was binned with a bin size of @xmath66  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath67 is the number of sources in the i - th bin , @xmath68 is the size of the bin and @xmath64 is the the total area over which sources in this bin could be detected . in figure  [ logn ]",
    "the resulting differential @xmath3 is shown .",
    "these results were compared to the relation reported by @xcite , which fitted the sexsi data with a broken power - law given by @xmath69 for @xmath70  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 and @xmath71 for fainter sources . as it is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ logn ] , this parametrization provides a good fit to the cyder data , even though some scatter is present .",
    "a @xmath72 test to this fit compared to the observed data gave a reduced @xmath72 of 1.37 .",
    "207 of the total 267 x - ray sources ( 77% ) were detected in our optical @xmath4-band images , searching in a radius of 2.5@xmath43 ( @xmath18 4 times the typical seeing ) around the centroid of the x - ray emission .",
    "the average offset between an x - ray source and the nearest optical counterpart is @xmath73 with a standard deviation of @xmath74 . in our optical images we detected typically @xmath75 sources in @xmath76",
    "so the chance of having a random source in a 2.5@xmath43 radius is @xmath77% and therefore our choice of 2.5@xmath43 as the maximum allowed offset is reasonable to avoid spurious associations . in cases where",
    "more than one counterpart was found inside this radius the closest optical source to the x - ray centroid was assumed to be the right counterpart .",
    "the @xmath4 magnitude distribution for the x - ray sources with detected optical counterparts in the cyder fields is shown on figure [ v_dist ] .",
    "x - ray sources cover the range from @xmath78 to 26 mags and higher ( fainter than our optical magnitude limit ) .",
    "the hatched histogram in figure  [ v_dist ] shows the magnitude distribution of sources targeted for spectroscopy , while the cross - hatched histogram shows the distribution for sources with spectroscopic identifications .",
    "a k - s test performed comparing the total @xmath4 magnitude distribution to the magnitude distribution for sources targeted for spectroscopy revealed that the hypothesis that both distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution ( the null hypothesis ) is accepted at the 98.7% confidence level .",
    "however , the effect of the optical flux in the efficiency of spectroscopic identifications can be seen by comparing the magnitude distribution for sources successfully identified and the total sample , namely the incompleteness of the sample with spectroscopic identification at the faint optical flux end is evident in this figure , even though the target selection was independent of the optical properties of the source .",
    "this effect is also observed in the @xmath5-band ( figure  [ i_dist ] ) , where 181 x - ray sources counterparts were detected ( 68% ) , a lower number than in the deeper @xmath4-band images . in this case , the decrease in the efficiency of spectroscopic identifications with decreasing optical flux is also evident in figure  [ i_dist ] .",
    "the average @xmath45 color for x - ray sources with optical counterparts is @xmath79 ; its distribution , shown in figure  [ vi_dist ] , shows that the efficiency of the spectroscopic identifications is independent of the @xmath45 color of the optical counterpart .",
    "a k - s test performed comparing the sample with spectroscopic identification to the total sample show that both distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution with a confidence level of 99.89% .",
    "53 out of 267 ( @xmath80% ) sources were not detected in any of the two optical bands .",
    "the vast majority of these sources are also very faint in x - rays , so that many of them were only detected in the soft band , that is more sensitive in chandra .",
    "this does not imply that they have an intrinsically soft spectrum .",
    "in fact , given the known relation between hardness ratio and x - ray flux @xcite , it is plausible that these sources are hard and therefore good candidates to be obscured agn . 5 of these sources were only detected in the hard band , and therefore should have a very hard spectrum in x - rays , that combined with the fact that are very faint in the optical bands makes them good candidates to be obscured agn at relatively high redshifts .",
    "this lack of detection of x - ray faint sources in optical images acts as a selection effect against the study of obscured agn .",
    "however , this bias can be overcome by studying these sources in the near infrared @xcite , where the effects of dust obscuration are much smaller . in a following paper ( f. castander , in prep ) properties of these sources in the near infrared bands",
    "will be presented .",
    "the @xmath4-band magnitude versus redshift plot ( figure  [ v_z ] ) reveals how the source composition changes with redshift , and how it is potentially affected by the implicit optical flux cut for spectroscopy .",
    "while at low redshift ( @xmath81 ) we find mostly obscured agn and normal galaxies , characterized by an absolute optical magnitude @xmath82 , at higher redshift they become too faint in the optical bands and therefore only unobscured agn ( that have mostly @xmath83 ) can be found .",
    "this implies that our survey may be biased against detecting obscured agn at high redshift .",
    "this effect is investigated in more detail in ",
    "[ disc ] .",
    "sources with spectroscopic identification were classified using a combination of optical and x - ray criteria .",
    "x - ray sources showing stellar spectra were classified as stars . for extragalactic sources ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity was computed from the observed x - ray flux using the relation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the luminosity distance calculated for the assumed cosmology .",
    "this luminosity is therefore the uncorrected , observed frame x - ray luminosity .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for dust obscuration or k - corrections given that for most sources the number of observed counts was too small to perform spectral fitting and therefore to calculate the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath7 or the intrinsic spectral shape .    in order to separate x - ray emission generated by agn activity from the emission coming from x - ray binaries and star formation in galaxies we used a simple x - ray luminosity threshold criterion .",
    "locally , the most x - ray luminous star forming galaxy known ( ngc 3256 ) has a total x - ray luminosity @xmath86  ergs  s@xmath2 in the ( 0.5 - 10 ) kev band @xcite .",
    "another source of luminous x - ray emission is the presence of hot gas in elliptical galaxies , which at low redshift is extended and therefore easily separated from agn emission ; at high redshift it is not resolved and thus harder to separate from agn activity . however , according to the @xcite catalog of elliptical galaxies with detected x - ray emission , only a few normal galaxies have @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we adopted @xmath88  ergs  s@xmath2 in the total ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) band as the threshold separating sources dominated by agn activity from those dominated by star formation or other processes in a galaxy .",
    "given the relatively low number of galaxies found in the survey , we expect this classification method to have a small effect on the total numbers of agn reported .    objects with a total x - ray luminosity @xmath89  ergs  s@xmath2 and narrow emission or absorption lines ( velocity dispersion less than 1000  km  s@xmath2 ) were classified as normal galaxies , while sources with @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 were classified as unobscured ( type 1 ) or obscured ( type 2 ) agn depending on whether they show broad or narrow lines on their optical spectrum .",
    "furthermore , sources with @xmath90  ergs  s@xmath2 are called qso-1 , or simply qso , if they have broad lines or qso-2 if the lines are narrow , but they are still considered agn .    for sources with spectroscopic identification ,",
    "figure  [ vi_z ] shows the @xmath45 color as a function of redshift .",
    "x - ray sources identified as type 1 agn ( broad emission lines ) fall near the position expected for qsos , calculated convolving the optical filters with the sloan digital survey composite quasar spectrum @xcite .",
    "galaxies / type 2 agn , which are only detected up to @xmath91 , are located in the region expected for galaxies ranging from elliptical to sb types and have redder colors than type 1 agn .",
    "the expected colors for each type of galaxy at a given redshift were calculated using the galaxy spectrum models of @xcite assuming that there is no evolution in the spectrum with redshift . from figure  [ vi_z ]",
    "it is clear that objects classified as obscured agn have redder colors , consistent with those of the host - galaxies .",
    "in fact , obscured agn have an average @xmath45 color of 1.46 with a standard deviation of 0.58 , while unobscured agn have an average color of 0.56 and standard deviation of 0.46    the redshift distribution for sources with spectroscopic identification is shown in figure  [ red_dist ] .",
    "when the whole sample of x - ray sources is considered , this distribution has a maximum at very low redshift , @xmath92 .",
    "however , when only sources with @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 ( i.e. , those dominated by agn activity ) are included the peak is displaced to higher redshifts , namely @xmath93 . as it is shown by the hatched distribution in figure [ red_dist ] , the high redshift population ( @xmath94 ) is completely dominated by broad line agn ( most of them quasars with @xmath90  ergs  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this is explained by the high optical luminosity of these objects , which makes them easier to identify , even at large distances and by the lack of near infrared information at this point , that is very useful to detect obscured agn , in particular at high redshift @xcite .    in order to investigate possible relations between x - ray and optical emission for different classes of sources , in figure  [ fx_v ] we plot hard x - ray flux versus @xmath4-band magnitude .",
    "most of the sources are located in the region bounded by @xmath95 .",
    "starburst galaxies detected in x - rays are typically bright in the optical bands and faint in x - rays , and are therefore characterized by @xmath96 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unobscured ( type 1 ) agn / quasars are located around the @xmath97 @xcite position although the scatter is large , while obscured ( type 2 ) agn / quasars have in general @xmath98 since most of the optical light from the central engine is blocked from our view but low - luminosity examples of obscured agn can be found also with @xmath99 as it will be discussed in  5 .",
    "unidentified sources at high @xmath6 are unlikely to be unobscured agn because their broad emission lines would have been easy to see in the optical spectra , so they are probably obscured agn .",
    "figure [ l_z ] shows the observed - frame hard x - ray ( 2 - 8 kev ) luminosity versus redshift diagram for sources with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "if we assume a flux limit of @xmath100  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 ( which would yield a total of 5 counts in the 0.5 - 8 kev band in a @xmath0 acis - i 60 ks observation for @xmath101 ) , the solid line in figure [ l_z ] shows the detection limit for x - ray sources in our survey . if an optical magnitude of @xmath102 mag is taken as the approximate flux limit for spectroscopy ( there are fainter sources for which spectroscopy is possible , but the identification relies in the presence of strong emission lines ) and a ratio of x - ray to optical emission of @xmath103 is assumed , then the dashed line in figure [ l_z ] shows our limiting magnitude as a function of redshift for sources with spectroscopy . this explains why incompleteness of the spectroscopic sample is particularly important at high redshift , where the fraction of x - ray sources with spectroscopic identification declines .",
    "if the same material that is causing the absorption of x - rays is responsible for the extinction in the optical bands , then a relation between these two quantities can be expected , namely the reddest sources in the optical ( higher value of @xmath45 ) should also be the x - ray hardest sources .",
    "a typical way to quantify the steepness of the x - ray spectrum is using the hardness ratio ( hr ) defined as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the count rates in the hard and soft x - ray bands respectively .    in figure  [ hr_vi ]",
    "the hr versus @xmath45 optical color is presented . in this diagram ,",
    "no clear relation between hr and optical color is observed .",
    "the absence of a correlation can be explained by the differences in the intrinsic optical and x - ray spectrum for different types of sources detected in the x - ray bands , independent of the amount of obscuration present .",
    "note , however , that in general sources optically classified as obscured agn are redder ( larger @xmath45 colors ) than unobscured agn as was previously observed on figure  [ vi_z ] and also tend to have higher values of hr .",
    "this lack of a strong relationship between hr and optical color even for sources classified as agn - dominated can be explained in part by the effects of k - corrections caused by the different redshifts of the sources and by changes in the intrinsic spectrum with parameters other than obscuration , e.g. luminosity @xcite .",
    "sources without spectroscopic identification ( crosses on figure [ hr_vi ] ) have in general redder colors than unobscured agn , that are similar to the colors of spectroscopically confirmed obscured agn and therefore are consistent with being moderately obscured agn at relatively high redshift ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "most of these sources however present a soft x - ray spectrum , that can be explained if these sources are at moderately high redshift so that the observed frame chandra bands traces higher energy emission , that is less affected by absorption .",
    "however , this is highly speculative , and the final answer about the nature of these optically faint x - ray sources will come from either deeper optical spectroscopy or from the near infrared data .      of the 267 x - ray sources detected in the cyder fields ,",
    "106 were identified using optical spectroscopy . while the fraction of sources identified is biased toward higher optical fluxes ( see figures [ v_dist ] and [ i_dist ] ) , figure  [ vi_dist ] shows that the optical colors of the sources in the sample both targeted and identified by optical spectroscopy follow a similar distribution as those of the total sample .",
    "the redshift distribution of the sample with spectroscopic identification is presented in figure  [ red_dist ] .",
    "x - ray sources in this sample span a wide range in redshift , @xmath108 .",
    "the mean redshift for our extragalactic sample with spectroscopic identification is @xmath109 and the peak is located at a low redshift , @xmath110 .",
    "when only the sources dominated by agn activity ( i.e. , @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 ) are considered , the mean redshift is @xmath111 while the peak is at @xmath112 . for sources optically classified as unobscured agn ,",
    "the average redshift is @xmath113 and the peak is at @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the nature of the _ identified _ x - ray sources changes as a function of redshift . at @xmath115 ,",
    "the sample is dominated by normal galaxies ( @xmath116% ) and obscured agn . in the @xmath117 region ,",
    "just a few normal galaxies are found and the population is dominated by obscured agn ( 77% ) , while at @xmath118 the vast majority of the sources found are unobscured agn .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosity distribution for the sample of sources with spectroscopic redshift can be seen in figure  [ l_dist ] . in terms of luminosity ,",
    "the few sources optically classified as galaxies detected in the x - ray sample dominate the low luminosity bins . in the intermediate x - ray luminosity bins ( @xmath119  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 ) , most of the sources are optically classified as obscured agn , while in the higher luminosity bins ( @xmath90  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 ) the vast majority of the sources are optically identified as unobscured agn .",
    "this change of the source type as a function of x - ray luminosity is further investigated in   [ disc ] .    in our sample",
    "there is only one source classified as qso-2 based on its observed x - ray luminosity and optical spectrum : cxocy - j125315.2 - 091424 at @xmath120 , located in the c2 field .",
    "52 counts were detected in the hard x - ray band , while no emission was detected in the soft x - ray band and therefore the hardness ratio is -1 .",
    "the optical spectrum of this source is presented in figure  [ qso2_spec ] .",
    "narrow emission lines like ciii , mgii and oii are clearly visible in this spectrum and were used to calculate the redshift of the source .",
    "the total ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) observed x - ray luminosity of this source is @xmath121  ergs  s@xmath2 making this the brightest obscured agn in our sample .",
    "given the observed hardness ratio and redshift of this source , the expected neutral hydrogen column density in the line of sight is @xmath122@xmath9 assuming either an intrinsic power law with exponent 1.9 or 1.7 , consistent with the optical classification of very obscured agn .",
    "in the total sample with spectroscopic identification 7 sources are classified as stars ( 6.6% ) , 11 as normal galaxies ( 10.4% ) , 38 are identified as obscured agn ( 35.8% ) , and 50 as unobscured agn ( 47.2% ) .",
    "these fractions are similar to the findings of other x - ray surveys , as shown in table  [ others ] .    the champ survey @xcite covers a total of 14 deg@xmath21 . in their first spectroscopy report",
    ", 6 @xmath0 fields were covered to a depth of @xmath123 mag @xcite . in order",
    "the compare with their results , we applied our classification scheme to their data .",
    "namely , narrow - line and absorption - line galaxies with @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 were classified as obscured agn , sources with broad lines as unobscured agn , while the remaining extragalactic sources were classified as galaxies .",
    "the main reason for the discrepancies between their source mix and ours ( table  [ others ] ) is the optical magnitude cut for spectroscopy , @xmath50 magnitudes brighter than cyder , which explains why their sample is clearly dominated by unobscured agn , the optically brighter x - ray emitting sources .    in table",
    "[ others ] , our sample is also compared to both the chandra deep fields north @xcite and south @xcite , each covering @xmath124 deg@xmath59 . in the first case",
    ", we use the spectroscopic follow - up of x - ray sources by @xcite , which is 87% complete for sources with @xmath125 mag . here",
    ", our classification scheme was applied directly to their data , finding that a low number of unobscured agn was found , which can be explained by the optical nature of the sources selected for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "also , a larger number of galaxies relative to other surveys can be seen .",
    "this can be explained by the very deep x - ray coverage in the cdf - n , which allows for the detection of a large number of sources with low @xmath126 and high spatial density , like non - active galaxies .    in the cdf - s ,",
    "our results were compared with the spectroscopic identifications of x - ray sources from @xcite . in this case , spectra were obtained for 168 x - ray sources and identifications are 60% complete for sources with @xmath125 mag . compared to the cyder survey , the source composition is similar , even though a larger number of x - ray normal galaxies is found in the cdf - s , as expected given its fainter x - ray sensitivity .",
    "however , the fractions of obscured to unobscured agn are similar ( within @xmath127% ) which can be explained by the similarities in the spectroscopic follow - up programs , since both cyder and cdf - s are @xmath128% complete for x - ray sources with @xmath125 mag .",
    "the cyder survey is located in an intermediate regime in terms of area coverage and sensitivity .",
    "a critical step in understanding the properties of the x - ray population is the existence of extensive follow - up at other wavelengths .",
    "in particular , optical spectroscopy plays a key role , allowing us to determine redshifts and to identify the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , most x - ray surveys are limited by their ability to obtain spectroscopic identifications for a large fraction of the sources , hopefully without biasing the sample . in the case of the cyder survey , we used 8 m class telescopes in order to extend the spectroscopic coverage to fainter optical magnitudes , namely to @xmath129 mag .    from table  [ others ] , it is clear that the kind of x - ray sources identified in surveys depends directly on the depth of the optical spectroscopy follow - up .",
    "for example , unobscured agn are bright in the optical bands , therefore in surveys with shallow optical follow - up mostly unobscured agn are detected ( e.g.,champ ) . on the other hand , deep x - ray coverage , together with an extensive spectroscopy campaign based mostly on the keck 10-m telescopes ,",
    "allows the cdf - n to detect more faint optical counterparts .",
    "therefore , the population in very deep surveys is dominated by normal galaxies to the cdf - n depths and obscured agn in the cdf - s range .    in our survey ,",
    "a total of 50 ( 47.2% ) broad - line agn were detected .",
    "while all of them have a hard x - ray luminosity @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 , two thirds of them have @xmath90  ergs  s@xmath2 and therefore are classified as quasars .",
    "the average redshift for the broad line sample is @xmath130 , which is much higher than the value found for the remaining x - ray sources .",
    "this is clearly explained by the greater optical brightness of unobscured agn relative to other x - ray emitters .",
    "using a combination of hr and x - ray luminosity together with optical spectroscopy is very useful for classifying x - ray sources @xcite . in figure",
    "[ hr_lx ] , the hr versus hard x - ray luminosity diagram is presented . in this case",
    "we used a hr=-0.2 in agn - dominated sources rather than the optical spectra to separate obscured and unobscured agn , which is equivalent to an effective column density @xmath131  @xmath9 for spectral index @xmath13 or @xmath132  @xmath9 for @xmath101 , so this is a conservative cut to the number of obscured agn . also , quasar - like sources are distinguished from other x - ray sources using @xmath90  ergs  s@xmath2 as a dividing line . except for one source",
    "described in   4.4 ,",
    "all the quasars have broad emission lines in their optical spectrum .",
    "most sources that show broad emission lines have hr@xmath133 , meaning that they have little or no absorption in x - rays , consistent with their unabsorbed agn optical spectrum . for non - agn",
    "dominated x - ray emission , no correlation is found between hr and x - ray luminosity .",
    "also , these sources do not have a characteristic hr value and very hard or soft sources can be found .",
    "this x - ray emission is expected to be mostly from high - mass x - ray binaries and type - ii supernova remnants in spiral galaxies while for elliptical galaxies the x - ray emission is most likely dominated by hot gas with some contribution from low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "therefore , given the wide range of different x - ray emitter classes together with the lower luminosity , which leads to lower fluxes and therefore larger errors in the hr measurements , can explain why there is no clear correlation between hr and x - ray luminosity and there is no characteristic hr value for low - luminosity , non - agn x - ray emitters .    for agn - dominated sources ,",
    "the relation between the @xmath6 ratio and hard x - ray luminosity ( @xmath134 ) is investigated in figure  [ fxopt_lx ] . for sources classified optically as unobscured agn",
    "there is no correlation between @xmath6 and x - ray luminosity , while for obscured agn there is a clear correlation in the sense that obscured sources with lower x - ray luminosity have lower @xmath6 while the hard x - ray sources with large x - ray luminosity also have systematically larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "this effect can be explained if the optical light detected in obscured agn is dominated by the emission from the host galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that is nearly independent from the agn luminosity .",
    "therefore , for obscured sources that are luminous in x - rays , we can expect a larger @xmath6 ratio , as observed in our sample . performing a linear fit to the observed sample of sources optically classified as obscured agn",
    "we obtain a correlation at @xmath135 significance using the minimum @xmath72 test , with best - fit parameters given by @xmath136 this correlation is shown by the solid line in figure  [ fxopt_lx ] .",
    "this trend can also be observed at the same significance level if the @xmath5-band optical flux is used instead .",
    "this can be explained since the @xmath4 band is bluer and therefore it is more affected by dust obscuration , while in the @xmath5 band the host galaxy is more luminous , and therefore in both cases the host galaxy emission dominates over the agn optical radiation .",
    "a similar relation between @xmath6 and x - ray luminosity for obscured agn was found by @xcite in the high energy large area survey ( hellas2xmm ) . even though they used the @xmath137 band to calculate the optical luminosity , the correlations are similar .",
    "given the difficulties in finding obscured agn at @xmath118 , we are not able to disentangle a dependence of the obscured to unobscured agn numbers ratio with redshift from the strong selection effects on the sample .",
    "however , from figure  [ l_dist ] there is some indication that this ratio can depend on the observed x - ray luminosity . in order to investigate this effect in more detail , in figure  [ frac_lx ]",
    "the fraction of obscured to all agn is shown as a function of hard x - ray luminosity combining the hard x - ray sources detected in the cyder survey with 77 agn with @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 located in the goods - s field with identifications and redshifts reported by @xcite in order to increase the number of x - ray sources in each bin .",
    "this figure clearly shows that a dependence of the fraction of obscured agn with x - ray luminosity can be observed .",
    "a similar trend was first observed by @xcite and is consistent with the relation reported by @xcite and @xcite .    in other to further investigate this observed correlation , and to determine if it can be explained by selection effects , we used the agn population models of @xcite .",
    "originally used to predict the agn number counts in any wavelength from far infrared to x - rays , the @xcite model is based on the @xcite luminosity function and its luminosity - dependent density evolution in which the intrinsic @xmath7 distribution comes from a very simple unified model in which the intrinsic obscured to unobscured agn ratio is set to be 3:1 . the agn spectral energy distribution is modeled based on three parameters , namely the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the central engine , the neutral hydrogen column density in the line - of - sight and the redshift of the source in order to compare fluxes in one wavelength to another . even though this model was applied to the goods survey ,",
    "it can be applied to any other x - ray survey if the proper flux limit and area coverage are used .",
    "given that the luminosity function and agn sed library in this model are fixed , there is no free parameter to adjust .",
    "in figure  [ frac_lx ] we show the predicted correlation between the fraction of obscured to all agn and hard x - ray luminosity for sources with @xmath138 mag ( i.e. , the optical flux limit for spectroscopy ) both for intrinsic ( dot - dashed line ) and observed ( i.e. , adding the effects of obscuration and k - correction ; solid line ) x - ray luminosity . in both cases , a decrease in the fraction of obscured to all agn is observed with increasing luminosity , even when the intrinsic ratio is fixed and set to 3:4 .",
    "therefore , this observed correlation can be explained as a selection effect since for obscured agn their lower optical flux makes them harder to detect in spectroscopic surveys , in particular at higher redshifts where most of the more luminous agn are located .    a crude way to estimate the intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density ( @xmath7 ) in the line of sight",
    "is based on the measured hr . in order to estimate @xmath7",
    ", we assumed that the intrinsic x - ray spectrum of an agn can be described by a power law with photon index @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then generated a conversion table using xspec @xcite to calculate the expected hr for @xmath7 in the range @xmath139  @xmath9 and redshifts from @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "the spectral response of the acis camera was considered in this calculation .",
    "also , the amount of galactic absorption in each field as calculated based on the observations by @xcite was added , since all the x - ray emission from extragalactic sources passes through the intergalactic medium of our galaxy .",
    "then , using this conversion table , the observed hr can be translated into a @xmath7 value , taking into account the redshift of the source . even though for individual sources this method to estimate @xmath7 may not be very accurate , given the uncertainties associated to perform spectral fitting based on only two bins , these individual uncertainties average out in the distribution .    given that the acis camera is more sensitive in the soft x - ray band , we decided to exclude sources not detected in the hard band , in order to use only the sources for which the hr can give a reasonable idea of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "for agn - dominated sources ( i.e. @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath2 ) , this choice eliminates 34% of the sources . by cutting the sample to the sources detected in the hard band ,",
    "a similar fraction of objects optically classified as obscured and unobscured agn are removed from the sample and therefore we do not expect a significant bias introduced by this choice that on the other hand , allows a more precise statistical analysis , since a definite flux limit can be used . also , sources dominated by agn emission in x - ray have hard spectrum so if only sources detected in the hard band are considered , the contamination by non - agn x - ray emitters is reduced .",
    "therefore even sources detected with high significance in the soft band and not detected in the hard band are removed from the following analysis .",
    "the @xmath7 distribution for the sources in the reduced sample is presented in figure  [ nh_dist ] .",
    "while a significant number of sources , 23% , have @xmath7 values consistent with no absorption ( plotted at @xmath142  @xmath9 ) , some sources present moderate to high levels of absorption , with @xmath143  @xmath9 ( @xmath144% ) .",
    "the @xmath7 distribution for the x - ray sources in the goods survey @xcite , which overlaps with the chandra deep fields north and south , was calculated previously following a similar procedure by @xcite .",
    "the results of this calculation are also presented in figure  [ nh_dist ] scaled to the number of sources in the cyder survey . comparing the results from these two surveys with the predictions for the intrinsic @xmath7 distribution based on a simple agn unified model and the @xcite luminosity function made by @xcite",
    ", we found that the obscuration bias is more important for cyder than for goods , meaning that sources with @xmath145  @xmath9 are preferentially missed in the cyder survey , since obscuration makes them fainter even in the hard x - ray bands .    using the agn number counts predictions by @xcite adapted to the cyder flux limits and area coverage ,",
    "the observed hard x - ray flux distribution is compared to the predictions by this model ( figure  [ dist_h ] ) .",
    "when this sample is compared to the predictions by the @xcite model the results are very encouraging , showing a very good agreement characterized by a k - s confidence level to accept the null hypothesis of @xmath146% . using this model , in figure  [ dist_h ] the predicted contribution by unobscured ( type 1 ; _ dashed line _ ) and obscured ( type 2 ; _ dotted line _ ) agn are shown .    while in the @xcite model the intrinsic ratio of obscured to unobscured agn is 3:1 ( using @xmath147  @xmath9 as the dividing point ) , the prediction for the cyder x - ray sample is a ratio of 2.35:1 when the survey flux limit in the x - ray bands is considered .",
    "this is consistent with the claim that sources with @xmath145  @xmath9 are preferentially missed in the cyder x - ray sample .",
    "however , this ratio should be compared to the value of 0.76:1 obtained previously using optical spectroscopy to separate obscured and unobscured agn .",
    "this significant reduction in the relative number of sources classified as obscured agn can be explained by the optical magnitude cut introduced when optical spectroscopy is used . in the case of the cyder multiwavelength follow - up , only sources with @xmath148 mag have optical spectroscopy , and",
    "the completeness level decreases strongly with decreasing optical flux ( figure  [ v_dist ] ) .",
    "since obscured agn are in general faint optical sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , they are harder to identify using spectroscopy , which cause their relative number to decrease when compared to other x - ray sources that are brighter in the optical bands , like unobscured agn .",
    "we presented here the first results from the multiwavelength study of the x - ray sources in the cyder survey . in this work",
    ", we studied the optical and x - ray properties of 267 sources detected in 5 fields observed by @xmath0 and available in the archive , covering a total of @xmath149  deg@xmath59 and spanning a flux range of @xmath150  ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath2 .",
    "the x - ray flux distribution of cyder sources follows a @xmath151 relation , both cumulative and differential , that is consistent with the observations in existing x - ray survey .",
    "the cumulative @xmath3 distribution is consistent with the observations of @xcite , while the differential @xmath3 is in good agreement with the distribution derived by the sexsi survey @xcite .",
    "this implies that there are not significant variations in this sample compared to other existing surveys , and therefore that the results can be directly compared .    in general ,",
    "sources optically classified as obscured agn have redder optical colors than unobscured agn and are closer to the colors of normal galaxies , as expected from the unification model of agn .",
    "also , a correlation between @xmath6 and hard x - ray luminosity is observed in the sample of sources optically classified as obscured agn .",
    "the ratio of obscured agn seems to be changing as a function of x - ray luminosity , in the sense that for more luminous sources the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn is lower than for less luminous objects .",
    "however , this relation can be explained as a selection effect since obscured agn are fainter in the optical bands and therefore harder to identify for spectroscopic surveys .",
    "in fact , the observed correlation can be reproduced using the @xcite models that have a fixed intrinsic ratio of 3:4 if an optical cut of @xmath138 mag ( i.e. , the magnitude limit for spectroscopy ) is used .",
    "the @xmath7 distribution for sources in the cyder survey is consistent with the predicted distribution by @xcite assuming a torus geometry for the obscuring material once selection effects are accounted .",
    "this implies that x - ray surveys are subject to significant incompleteness for sources with large amounts of absorption . in the particular case of the cyder survey",
    "this incompleteness is important for sources with @xmath152  @xmath9 .",
    "however , once these selection effects are accounted for , the observed hard x - ray flux distribution is consistent with the predictions of the models of @xcite .",
