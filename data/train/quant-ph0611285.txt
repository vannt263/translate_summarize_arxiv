    "the question of generating and measuring entanglement in multipartite quantum systems has become of greater interest with the development of the field of quantum information .",
    "entanglement generation is an important aspect of several quantum information processes , such as superdense coding @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , or quantum data hiding @xcite .",
    "various methods have been proposed in order to generate highly entangled quantum states , based on pseudo - random unitary operators @xcite or on the entangling power of chaotic quantum maps @xcite or intermediate quantum maps @xcite .",
    "entanglement generation by means of pseudo - random unitary operators or chaotic quantum maps relies upon the fact that unitary evolution of any initial state leads to states whose entanglement properties are close to those of random states , in particular to highly entangled states . + in order to quantify the entanglement of a state , or the entangling power of an operator , a number of entanglement measures have been proposed , based either on quantum information theory or on thermodynamical considerations : entanglement of formation and distillable entanglement @xcite , relative entropy @xcite , @xmath0-tangle @xcite , concurrence @xcite . for bipartite entanglement of pure states ,",
    "these measures all reduce to the entropy of entanglement @xcite , which can be proved to be a unique entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "the entropy of entanglement corresponds to the von neumann entropy of the partial density matrix obtained by tracing over one subsystem . rather than the von neumann entropy itself ,",
    "one often prefers to consider the purity @xmath1 , which corresponds ( up to constants ) to the so - called linear entropy , that is the first - order term in the expansion of the von neumann entropy around its maximum . to quantify the degree of entanglement of multipartite pure states , one measure",
    "commonly used , based on purity , is the measure proposed by meyer and wallach in @xcite .",
    "it consists in taking the average of the bipartite entanglement of one qubit with all others , measured by the purity ( see equation ( [ mwent ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "meyer - wallach entanglement was used e.g. to quantify entanglement generation for pseudo - random operators @xcite or intermediate or chaotic quantum maps @xcite .",
    "+ the study of purity or meyer - wallach entanglement is of particular interest for random quantum states .",
    "random pure states as column vectors of random unitary matrices distributed according to the invariant haar measure can be shown to be entangled with high probability .",
    "various analytical calculations have been carried out to characterize entanglement properties of random states .",
    "expressions for the first moment of the purity have been obtained by lubkin @xcite ; the second and third moments have been derived in @xcite , following earlier work @xcite .",
    "the average entropy has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of entanglement measures for random density matrices were obtained in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the average value for each schmidt coefficient of a random pure state has been calculated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the average entropy of a subsystem was obtained from the average tsallis entropy @xcite . + to further characterize entanglement of random pure states , our aim here is to give an exact expression for all moments of the probability density distribution @xmath2 of the purity for a bipartite random pure state .",
    "since the probability distribution @xmath2 is defined over a bounded interval ( @xmath1 is bounded ) , the knowledge of all moments determines uniquely the probability distribution @xcite .",
    "there are various techniques to obtain a function approximating the exact probability density distribution in a controlled way ( that is , by an expansion where the error can be bounded ) from the knowledge of its moments . in @xcite",
    "an algorithm was given to construct polynomials converging to the probability distribution .",
    "we will rather follow @xcite , where the asymptotic expansion for nearly gaussian distributions is calculated at all orders . in section [ bipartite ] the moments @xmath3 for the distribution @xmath2 are calculated , and the construction of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath2 at all orders from its moments is recalled . in section [ multipartite ] the approximate moments @xmath4 for the distribution @xmath5 are derived . for both distributions , the moments are expressed as sums involving a finite number of combinatorial terms and can be easily calculated effectively . as an illustration",
    ", we give the first values of the cumulants and calculate the probability density distribution expansion for meyer - wallach entanglement .",
    "let @xmath6 be a pure state belonging to a hilbert space @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are spanned respectively by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the schmidt coefficients for @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the state @xmath6 has a schmidt decomposition ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath14 the bipartite entanglement measure for @xmath6 can be expressed throught schmidt coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "the entropy of entanglement is the shannon entropy of the @xmath13 s : @xmath15 .",
    "the purity @xmath16 of the state @xmath6 can be expressed as @xmath17 for random states the schmidt coefficients are distributed according to the density @xmath18 for @xmath19 $ ] , with some normalisation factor @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-th moment of the purity is then given by @xmath21 the calculation of @xmath3 requires the evaluation of integrals of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath26 + all permutations of the @xmath27 is a symmetric function of the @xmath13 , and @xmath28 is the vandermonde determinant @xmath29 the integral @xmath30 is evaluated in the appendix and yields @xmath31 where ",

    "this leads to @xmath38 replacing @xmath39 by its value @xmath40 and correspondingly changing all indices @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( and @xmath33 to @xmath43 ) , one finally obtains @xmath44 note that one can cast into an expression more symmetric in @xmath45 and @xmath46 by noting that @xmath47,\\ ] ] yielding @xmath48.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation is a closed expression , involving only a finite sum over partitions of @xmath0 into numbers greater or equal to 0 .",
    "note that the order of the @xmath33 matters : for instance for @xmath49 and @xmath50 the sum will involve three terms @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these partitions can be easily generated for any @xmath0 by some suitable algorithm ( see e.g. @xcite for such an algorithm generating the partitions required ) . from equation one can get the expressions for the cumulants of the distribution @xmath2 . indeed , given the moments @xmath54 of a distribution the @xmath0-th cumulant @xmath55 reads ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and the sum runs over all @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",

    "as expected , @xmath65 corresponds to lubkin s expression @xcite for the average purity . for @xmath66",
    "one recovers the expressions derived in @xcite . for larger @xmath0",

    "the asymptotic expansion of the distribution can be obtained ( see @xcite and references therein ) by edgeworth expansion as a function of the normal distribution @xmath72 , the mean @xmath73 , the variance @xmath74 , and rescaled cumulants @xmath75 : @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each @xmath77 the sum runs over @xmath78 such that @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is defined by @xmath81 .",

    "the meyer - wallach entanglement of a pure @xmath87-dimensional state @xmath6 coded on @xmath88 qubits ( with @xmath89 ) can be defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the purity of the @xmath92-th qubit @xcite . in order to calculate @xmath93 for bipartite random pure states we need to calculate the average purity of a bipartite system belonging to a hilbert space @xmath7 , where @xmath8 has dimension @xmath49 and @xmath9 has dimension @xmath94 .",
