    "the _ graph embedding _ of a guest graph into a host graph is to map ( typically one - to - one ) nodes and edges of the guest graph onto nodes and paths of the host graph , respectively , so that an edge of the guest graph is mapped onto a path connecting the images of end - nodes of the edge .",
    "the graph embedding problem is to embed a guest graph into a host graph with certain constraints and/or optimization criteria .",
    "this problem has applications such as efficient vlsi layout and parallel computation .",
    "i.e. , the problem of efficiently laying out vlsi can be formulated as the graph embedding problem with modeling a design rule on wafers and a circuit to be laid out as host and guest graphs , respectively .",
    "also , the problem of efficiently implementing a parallel algorithm on a message passing parallel computer system consisting of processing elements connected by an interconnection network can be formulated as the graph embedding problem with modeling the interconnection network and interprocess communication in the parallel algorithm as host and guest graphs , respectively .",
    "see for a survey , e.g. , @xcite . the major criteria to measure the efficiency of an embedding are dilation , node - congestion , and edge - congestion . in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of embedding a guest graph with the minimum edge - congestion into a @xmath15-dimensional grid with @xmath4 and the same size as that of the guest graph .",
    "embeddings into grids with the minimum edge - congestion are important for both vlsi layout and parallel computation . actually , design rules on wafers in vlsi are usually modeled as @xmath16-dimensional grids , and an edge - congestion provides a lower bound on the number of layers needed to lay out a given circuit . as for parallel computation , multidimensional grid networks , including hypercubes , are popular for interconnection networks . on interconnection networks adopting circuit switching or wormhole routing , in particular , embeddings with the edge - congestion of @xmath17 are essential to minimize the communication latency @xcite . in addition , the setting that host and guest graphs have the same number of nodes is important for parallel computation because the processing elements are expensive resource and idling some of them is wasteful .",
    "graph embedding into grids with small edge - congestion has extensively been studied .",
    "table  [ tb : summary ] summarizes previous results of graph embeddings minimizing edge - congestion ( and other criteria as well in some results ) for various combinations of guest graphs and host grids .",
    ".previous results of graph embeddings minimizing edge - congestion .

    "leiserson @xcite and valiant @xcite independently proposed such embeddings based on graph separators .",
    "in particular , it was proved in @xcite that any @xmath0-node graph with maximum node degree at most @xmath23 and an edge - separator of size @xmath2 can be laid out in an area of @xmath24 if @xmath25 , @xmath26 if @xmath27 , and @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "a separator of a graph @xmath30 is a set @xmath31 of either nodes or edges whose removal partitions the node set @xmath32 of @xmath30 into two subsets of roughly the same size with no edge between the subsets .",
    "the graph @xmath30 is said to have a ( recursive ) separator of size @xmath33 if @xmath34 and the subgraphs partitioned by @xmath31 recursively have separators of size @xmath33 .",
    "separators are important tools to design divide - and - conquer algorithms and have been extensively studied .",
    "bhatt and leighton @xcite achieved a better layout with several nice properties including reduced dilation as well as the same or better area as that of @xcite by introducing a special type of edge - separators called _ bifurcators_. an approximation algorithm for vlsi layout was proposed in @xcite .",
    "separator - based graph embeddings on hypercubes were presented in @xcite . in particular , heun and mayr @xcite proved that any @xmath0-node graph with maximum node degree @xmath1 and an extended edge - bisector of polylogarithmic size can be embedded into a @xmath35-dimensional cube with a dilation of @xmath36 and an edge - congestion of @xmath37 .",
    "a quite general embedding based on the multicommodity flow was presented by leighton and rao  @xcite , who proved that any @xmath0-node bounded degree graph @xmath30 can be embedded into an @xmath0-node bounded degree graph @xmath38 with both dilation and edge - congestion of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the _ flux _ of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that @xmath30 can be embedded into an @xmath0-node @xmath15-dimensional grid with both dilation and edge - congestion of @xmath42 for any fixed @xmath15 .      in this paper , we improve previous graph embeddings into grids and hypercubes in terms of edge - congestion , arbitrary dimension , and minimum size of host grids .",
    "in particular , we claim that if a guest graph has a small separator , then we do not need grids with large dimension , such as hypercubes , to suppress the edge - congestion .",
    "first , we present an embedding algorithm based on the permutation routing . the permutation routing is to construct paths connecting given pairs of source and destination nodes such that no two pairs have the same sources or the same destinations .",
    "this embedding algorithm achieves an edge - congestion as stated in the following theorem :    [ th : permutationembedding ] any graph with @xmath0 nodes and maximum node degree @xmath1 can be embedded into a @xmath15-dimensional @xmath43-grid ( @xmath44 ) with a dilation at most @xmath45 and an edge - congestion at most @xmath46 .",
    "we prove this theorem in sect .",
    "[ ssc : permutationroutingembedding ] by observing that for any one - to - one mapping of nodes of a guest graph @xmath30 to nodes of a host graph @xmath38 , routing edges of @xmath30 on @xmath38 can be reduced to at most @xmath47 instances of permutation routing , and that the permutation routing algorithm proposed in @xcite has an edge - congestion at most @xmath48 .",
    "theorem  [ th : permutationembedding ] achieves an edge - congestion of @xmath49 if @xmath50 for each @xmath51 .",
    "it is worth noting that this edge - congestion can slightly be improved if the host grid @xmath38 is a @xmath15-dimensional cube .",
    "it is well - known that any one - to - one mapping of @xmath52 inputs to @xmath52 outputs on a @xmath15-dimensional bene network can be routed with the edge - congestion @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we can easily observe that mapping the nodes in each row of the bene network to each node of @xmath38 induces a ( many - to - one ) embedding with the edge - congestion @xmath23 .",
    "because each node of @xmath38 has exactly two inputs and two outputs in a row of the bene network , any pair of instances of permutation routing on @xmath38 can be routed with an edge - congestion at most @xmath23 . at most @xmath47 instances of permutation routing , obtained from any one - to - one mapping of nodes of @xmath30 to nodes of @xmath38 and from edges of @xmath30 , can be grouped into @xmath53 pairs of instances of permutation routing .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 can be embedded into a @xmath35-dimensional cube with an edge - congestion at most @xmath54 .",
    "second , we present an embedding algorithm based on separators that achieves an edge - congestion as stated in the following theorem :    [ th : embedgeneral ] suppose that @xmath30 is a graph with @xmath0 nodes , maximum node degree @xmath1 , and with a node - separator of size @xmath2 ( @xmath55 ) , and that @xmath56 is a grid with a fixed dimension @xmath4 , at least @xmath0 nodes , and with constant aspect ratio . then , @xmath30 can be embedded into @xmath56 with a dilation of @xmath57 , and with an edge - congestion of @xmath5 if @xmath6 , @xmath7 if @xmath8 , and @xmath9 if @xmath58 .",
    "the basic idea of theorem  [ th : embedgeneral ] is to partition the guest graph and the host grid using their edge - separators , embed the partitioned guest graphs into the partitioned host grids recursively , and to route cut edges of the guest graph on the host grid .",
    "we use theorem  [ th : permutationembedding ] to route cut edges with a nearly minimum edge - congestion in each recursive step .",
    "however , just doing this is not sufficient for our goal .",
    "in fact , we need further techniques to suppress the total edge - congestion incurred by whole recursive steps from upper to lower levels .",
    "there are two reasons of the insufficiency .",
    "the first reason is that recursive steps from upper to lower levels may use the same edge of the grid , which yields an edge - congestion of @xmath59 if we minimize the edge - congestion only in each individual recursive step .",
    "this is a crucial barrier to achieve an edge - congestion of @xmath5 for @xmath60 . to solve this",
    ", we divide the edge set of the grid into @xmath61 subsets of appropriate size and use each subset only in a constant number of recursive steps .",
    "the second and more significant reason is that a small subgraph of the guest graph to be embedded in a lower recursive step may have nodes incident to quite a large number of edges that have been cut in upper levels , which yields a large edge - congestion . specifically , if such a subgraph has @xmath62 nodes and @xmath63 outgoing edges to the other part of the guest graph , then because a subgrid into which the subgraph is embedded has @xmath64 outgoing edges , the edge - congestion is lower bounded by @xmath65 .",
    "a standard edge - separator aims to minimize the number of edges to be cut to partition a graph .",
    "thus , if we recursively use such edge - separators to partition a graph into small pieces , then although the number of cut edges in each recursive step is bounded , the number of outgoing edges from a subgraph to be embedded in a lower recursive step may become extremely large compared to the number of nodes of the subgraph . therefore , we introduce edge - separators bounding _ expansion _ ,",
    "i.e. , the number of outgoing edges from a subgraph in each recursive step , and present an algorithm to construct an edge - separator with expansion of @xmath14 from a node - separator of size @xmath2 .",
    "we describe the algorithm for edge - separators with bounded expansion in sect .",
    "[ sc : separators ] and prove theorem  [ th : embedgeneral ] in sect .",
    "[ ssc : separatorbasedembedding ] .    theorem  [ th : embedgeneral ] achieves constant ratio approximation for a fixed @xmath6 because any embedding has an edge - congestion at least @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath11 , then the edge - congestion of theorem  [ th : embedgeneral ] matches an existential lower bound within a constant factor .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath59 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 is derived from the following fact : there exists an @xmath0-node guest graph with constant degree and a node - separator of size @xmath69 whose any embedding into a @xmath16-dimensional grid with the edge - congestion  @xmath17 requires @xmath70 nodes of the grid @xcite .",
    "this implies that any embedding of the guest graph into a @xmath16-dimensional grid with @xmath0 nodes requires an edge - congestion of @xmath59 .",
    "this is because we can easily transform an embedding into an @xmath0-node grid with an edge - congestion @xmath71 into another embedding into an @xmath72-node grid with the edge - congestion @xmath17 by replacing each row and each column of the @xmath0-node grid with @xmath73 rows and @xmath73 columns , respectively .",
    "a similar transformation for vlsi layout is described in @xcite .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath74 for @xmath58 can be obtained as follows : we consider a guest graph @xmath30 with @xmath0 nodes and a node - separator of size @xmath75 such that each node in a cut set @xmath76 with @xmath77 is adjacent to every other node in @xmath30 .",
    "the graph @xmath30 obviously has @xmath78",
    ". suppose that we arbitrarily divide @xmath32 into two subsets of the same size .",
    "then , at least @xmath79 edges join nodes in one of the subsets and nodes in the other subset because at least half nodes of @xmath80 are contained in one of the subsets and adjacent to all nodes in the other subset . on the other hand",
    ", we can divide a @xmath15-dimensional @xmath0-node grid into two subgrids of the same size by removing @xmath81 edges .",
    "thus , any embedding of @xmath30 into the grid has an edge - congestion at least @xmath82 .",
    "theorem  [ th : embedgeneral ] has the following applications .",
    "it is well - known that any planar graph has a node - separator of size @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this was generalized in @xcite so that any graph with an excluded minor of a fixed size has a node - separator of size @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the following corollary :    [ cr : embedplanar ] any graph with @xmath0 nodes , maximum node degree @xmath1 , and with an excluded minor of a fixed size can be embedded into a grid of a fixed dimension @xmath15 with at least @xmath0 nodes and constant aspect ratio , with an edge - congestion of @xmath7 for @xmath12 and @xmath5 for @xmath13 .",
    "graphs with a fixed treewidth , such as trees , outerplanar graphs , and series - parallel graphs have a node - separator of a fixed size @xcite .",
    "therefore , we obtain the following corollary :    [ cr : embedseriesparallel ] any graph with @xmath0 nodes , maximum node degree @xmath1 , and with a fixed treewidth can be embedded into a grid of a fixed dimension at least @xmath16 with at least @xmath0 nodes and constant aspect ratio , with an edge - congestion of @xmath5 .",
    "our separator - based embedding algorithm performs in a polynomial time on the condition that a separator of the guest graph is given .",
    "although finding a separator of minimum size is generally np - hard  @xcite , approximation algorithms presented in @xcite can be applied to our algorithm .",
    "all our embedding algorithms yield a dilation of order of the diameter of the host grid .",
    "although such a dilation is trivial when only the dilation is minimized , this is not the case when edge - congestion is minimized . as we will demonstrate in sect .",
    "[ sc : dilation ] , in fact , there exists an @xmath0-node guest graph whose any embedding with the edge - congestion @xmath17 into an @xmath0-node @xmath16-dimensional grid requires a dilation of @xmath84 , far from the diameter @xmath85 .",
    "we do not know whether or not we can always achieve both a dilation of the host grid s diameter ( even with a multiplicative constant factor ) and constant ratio approximation for edge - congestion .",
    "this is negative if the host graph is general .",
    "as an example , suppose that @xmath38 is the host graph obtained from a complete binary tree with @xmath0 leaves by adding edges so that the leaves induce a @xmath86-grid .",
    "to be precise , the @xmath87 leaves of a subtree rooted by a node at an even distance @xmath51 to the root induce a @xmath88-subgrid .",
    "if the guest graph @xmath30 is an @xmath0-node complete graph , then any embedding of @xmath30 into @xmath38 with a dilation of the diameter @xmath89 of @xmath38 has an edge - congestion of @xmath90 because @xmath90 edges of @xmath30 must be routed through a single node of the tree part in @xmath38 to achieve such a dilation , while @xmath30 can be embedded into the grid part in @xmath38 with a dilation of @xmath91 and an edge - congestion of @xmath92 using a simple row - column routing .",
    "for a graph @xmath30 , @xmath32 and @xmath93 are the node set and edge set of @xmath30 , respectively .",
