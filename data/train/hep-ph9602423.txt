    "the most appealing explanation of the excessive production rates of prompt @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 observed at the fermilab tevatron @xcite is given by the combination of the ideas of gluon fragmentation into quarkonium @xcite and the color - octet mechanism @xcite , in which a gluon fragments into a color - octet @xmath8 @xmath4 pair which subsequently evolves nonperturbatively into the physical charmonium states by qcd dynamics .",
    "while the nonperturbative parameters associated with the color - octet mechanism must be extracted phenomenologically from the rates of prompt charmonium production , the prediction of the shape of the transverse momentum spectrum agrees well with the data @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of these two theoretical developments and their implications at the tevatron and lep can be found in ref.@xcite . if this mechanism is correct , it may give rise to many testable predictions for charmonium production in @xmath9 decay @xcite , low energy @xmath10 annihilation @xcite , photoproduction at fixed target and hera experiments @xcite , hadroproduction at fixed target experiments @xcite and at lhc @xcite , and @xmath11-meson decays @xcite .",
    "double prompt quarkonium production from the color - octet mechanism has also been studied at the tevatron @xcite . in this paper , we show that the color - octet mechanism can also provide the dominant contribution to @xmath0 production in @xmath1 decay .",
    "the available experimental data on charmonium production in @xmath1 decay are listed as follows , @xmath12 in which the cleo and the crystal ball results show a slight inconsistency .",
    "but it is interesting to note that these experiments can reach the branching fraction for @xmath13 at the level of @xmath14 .",
    "trottier @xcite studied the indirect @xmath0 production in @xmath1 decay via the production of intermediate physical @xmath15 states , which decay radiatively into @xmath0 .",
    "however , this indirect production of @xmath0 contributes to a branching ratio less than @xmath16 in @xmath1 decay .",
    "since the experimental branching fraction is already at the level of @xmath14 , we definitely need a new production mechanism to explain the data .",
    "we also hope that the slight discrepancy in the above experiments can be resolved in the near future .",
    "conventional wisdom tells us that hadronically @xmath1 decays predominantly through @xmath17 annihilation into three gluons .",
    "the rich gluon content in the final state makes it rather easy for the gluon to split into a @xmath18 pair in the color - octet @xmath8 configuration .",
    "if @xmath0 can be formed from this color - octet configuration at a significant level as predicted by braaten and fleming @xcite at the tevatron @xcite , charmonium states should be abundantly produced in @xmath1 decay .",
    "a previous theoretical study @xcite of the process @xmath19 was based on the color - evaporation model @xcite , with which the color - octet mechanism shares some common spirit , but the model fails to be systematic .",
    "another qualitative estimate for @xmath19 can be found in ref.@xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we will briefly review the description of the inclusive decay and production of quarkonium based on the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism given by bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite . in section 3 , we will discuss in detail several new color - octet processes relevant to @xmath0 production in @xmath1 decay allowed by the general factorization formula . in section 4 , we compare the production rates of different processes and discuss the energy spectrum of @xmath0 in @xmath1 decay .",
    "the factorization formalism @xcite for the inclusive decay and production of heavy quarkonium allows us to probe the complete quarkonium fock space in a systematic and consistent manner based upon nrqcd .",
    "it can be straightforwardly applied to the case of inclusive charmonium production from bottomonium decay @xcite . for the case of @xmath20 , we have the following factorization formula , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the short - distance factors for a @xmath17 pair in the state @xmath23 to decay into a @xmath24 pair in the state @xmath25 plus anything , where @xmath26 denote collectively the color , total spin , and orbital angular - momentum of the heavy quark pairs .",
    "@xmath22 can be calculated in perturbation theory as a series expansion in @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 .",
    "contributions to @xmath22 that are sensitive to the quarkonium scales ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 or smaller , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the relative velocities of the heavy quarks inside the bound states ) and to @xmath33 can be absorbed into the nrqcd matrix elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath35 to denote the vacuum expectation value @xmath36 of the operator @xmath37 .",
    "the nonperturbative factor @xmath34 is proportional to the probability for the @xmath17 pair to be in the state @xmath23 inside the physical bound state @xmath1 , while @xmath35 is proportional to the probability for a point - like @xmath24 pair in the state @xmath25 to form the bound state @xmath0 .",
    "the relative importance of the various terms in the above double factorization formula ( [ double_fact ] ) can be determined by the order of @xmath38 or @xmath32 in the nrqcd matrix elements and the order of @xmath39 in the short - distance factors @xmath22 .    in the color - singlet model @xcite , the nrqcd matrix elements involved in the process @xmath20 are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "according to the velocity scaling rules @xcite , they are scaled as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , and can be related to the quarkonium wavefunctions as follows : @xmath44 with @xmath45 denotes the number of colors .",
    "therefore , these color - singlet matrix elements can be determined from the leptonic widths of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the short - distance factor in the color - singlet model for this direct process includes @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the two possible color configurations of the heavy quark pair are denoted by @xmath48 for singlet and @xmath49 for octet . the leading order feynman diagrams for these processes are of order @xmath50 . due to such a high order in the strong coupling constant ,",
    "it is unlikely that these color - singlet processes can be the dominant production mechanism .",
    "the first example of the double factorization formula such as ( [ double_fact ] ) is the indirect @xmath0 production in the decay @xmath51 with @xmath52 considered by trottier @xcite .",
    "the short - distance factor @xmath53 is of order @xmath54 , which is enhanced by a factor of @xmath55 compared with the direct color - singlet processes mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , the infrared divergence in the leading order calculation of the short - distance factor indicates that the results are sensitive to the scale @xmath30 or smaller .",
    "therefore , in addition to the color - singlet matrix element @xmath56 ( scales like @xmath57 ) , one also needs to include the color - octet matrix element @xmath58 ( scales like @xmath59 ) to absorb the infrared divergence .",
    "the short - distance process associated with the color - octet matrix element is @xmath60 , which is of order @xmath61 . in this case , the introduction of the color - octet matrix element is required by perturbative consistency , since the infrared divergence would otherwise spoil the one - term factorization formula .    in the next section",
    ", we will consider the direct and indirect @xmath0 production in @xmath1 decay with short - distance factors of order @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "these are possible only if higher fock states of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 are considered .",
    "we will also consider processes with short - distance factors of order @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 that are suppressed by electromagnetic coupling but may or may not require higher fock states of the quarkonia . in the following , we will first consider the produced @xmath24 pair in the color - octet @xmath66 , @xmath8 , or @xmath67 configuration , which subsequently evolves into physical @xmath0 described by the matrix elements @xmath68 , @xmath69 , or @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "these color - octet matrix elements are suppressed by @xmath71 relative to the color - singlet matrix element @xmath72 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath69 has been extracted from the cdf data @xcite , while two different combinations of the other color - octet matrix elements have been extracted from the cdf data @xcite and from the photoproduction data by amundson _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "though of much smaller effects , we also consider the contributions by the higher fock state of the color - octet @xmath17 pair inside the @xmath1 associated with the matrix element @xmath73 , whose value has not yet been determined .",
    "an order of magnitude of this matrix element can , in principle , be estimated by considering the ratio @xmath74 which implies that its value should be highly suppressed .",
    "the ratio in ( [ ratio1 ] ) tells us that processes associated with a color - octet @xmath24 pair inside the produced @xmath0 and a color - singlet @xmath17 pair inside the decaying @xmath1 are much more important than those with a color - octet @xmath17 pair inside the @xmath1 and a color - singlet @xmath24 pair inside the @xmath0 .",

    "however , such a large value for this matrix element would substantially increase the hadronic width of @xmath1 , which would diminish the leptonic branching ratio to an unacceptable level .",
    "obviously , this matrix element enters into the hadronic width of the @xmath1 via the short - distance process @xmath83 . in order not to spoil the experimental value for the leptonic branching ratio and the total hadronic width of @xmath1 , it is necessary to put a bound on the value of the matrix element @xmath84",
    "the hadronic width of the @xmath1 has the factored form @xmath85 with the following short - distance factors calculated to leading order in @xmath86 and @xmath39 , @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 in eq .",

    "( [ qqbar1 ] ) and ( [ qqbar2 ] ) for simplicity . using the following expression for muonic",

    "alternatively , we can obtain another bound by using the total width of @xmath1 , but the result is not as good as the one given by eq.([bound ] ) . therefore , in the rest of the paper we will use the value @xmath101 gev@xmath78 . with this value for @xmath84 , we obtain the ratio @xmath102 which is now sufficiently small posing no threat to the experimental value of the leptonic width in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the input parameters used in our later numerical calculations are summarized in table  [ table1 ] for convenience .",
    "since all our new calculations are at tree - level only , we , to be consistent , extract the color - singlet matrix elements from the leptonic widths of @xmath103 , and @xmath1 using tree - level formulas .",
