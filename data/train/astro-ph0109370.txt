    "companion searches around nearby stars discovered first two ultracool dwarfs which belong to spectral types later than m. in 1988 , a brown dwarf candidate , gd 165b , was found as a companion to a white dwarf ( @xcite ) , and finally in 1995 , the first cool brown dwarf , gl 229b , was found as a companion to a young m dwarf ( @xcite ) .",
    "starting from 1997 , the number of ultracool dwarfs was significantly increased by the discoveries by sky surveys , denis ( @xcite ) , 2mass ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and sdss ( @xcite ) and now ultracool dwarfs form two distinct spectral types l and t ( @xcite ) .",
    "l dwarfs which are cooler than m dwarfs are selected by red color in the visible or near infrared ( @xmath2 1.3 ) and their subclasses are defined by optical red spectra .",
    "t dwarfs which are even cooler than l dwarfs are selected by very red color in the visible or very red visible to infrared color and defined by the presence of methane in the near - infrared spectra .",
    "t dwarfs are blue in the near infrared ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) . as of writing of this letter , more than one - hundred l dwarfs and more than twenty t dwarfs",
    "are known in the literature , including l / t transition objects ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the l / t transition objects or early t dwarfs show both methane and carbon monoxide in their @xmath1 band spectra and have @xmath3 colors intermediate between l and t dwarfs .    from the point of view of observations ,",
    "the sequence from l to early t to t dwarfs appears natural and there are a certain number of sample objects in each subclass of l dwarfs , early t dwarfs , and later t dwarfs .",
    "however , there are issues related to the l / t transition that need to be resolved before we fully understand these ultracool dwarfs .",
    "first of all , we need a theoretical explanation of the l / t transition process in which the behavior of colors and spectra must be understood . in this paper , we compare the observed l dwarf spectra with the unified models by tsuji ( 2001 ) .",
    "the models explain the behavior of the infrared colors through the sequence and approximately reproduce the spectra of l and t dwarfs .",
    "another issue is the presence of methane in l dwarfs . in the discovery paper of the first denis l dwarfs ,",
    "delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported an apparent detection of methane in denis 0205 - 11ab ( l7v ) in the @xmath1 band .",
    "however , tokunaga and kobayashi ( 1999 ) obtained a spectrum of this object and concluded that the 2 @xmath5 m feature was due to h@xmath6 collision induced absorption ( h@xmath6 cia ) . since then no researchers have claimed the presence of methane in late l dwarfs in the @xmath1 band ( @xcite,@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of methane in l dwarfs was confirmed by l band spectroscopy of a l5v and l8v by noll et al .",
    "so methane exists in l dwarfs and it is worth revisiting the features in late l dwarfs in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands taking into account the possible presence of methane absorption .",
    "observations were carried out at the subaru telescope on 2001 march 3 and 4 ut using the grism mode of the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the slit width of @xmath7 was sampled at @xmath8 per pixel and the resolution was about 330 at @xmath9 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the targets were nodded along the slit and observations taken in abba sequence where a and b stand for the first and second positions on the slit .",
    "2massw j1146345 + 223053 ( henceforth 2m1146 ) was observed on march 3 ut . at each of the four nod positions ,",
    "120 s exposures were acquired and the abba sequence was repeated three times at @xmath9 , with 120 s exposures , the sequence was repeated twice at @xmath0 and one cycle of 300 s exposures was obtained at @xmath1 . immediately after the observations of 2m1146 , @xmath10 spectra of sao81983 ( g5v )",
    "were obtained for the calibration of telluric transmission .",
    "2massw j0920122 + 351742 ( 2m0920 ) was observed on march 4 ut .",
    "the abba sequence was repeated twice at @xmath9 and @xmath0 with 120 s exposures and one cycle of 300 s exposures was obtained at @xmath1 . immediately after the observations of 2m0920 , @xmath10 spectra of sao61451 ( g0v )",
    "were obtained for transmission calibration .",
    "2massw j1507476 - 162738 ( 2m1507 ) was observed on march 4 ut .",
    "the abba sequence was obtained once at @xmath9 and @xmath0 with 120 s exposures , and at @xmath1 with 150 s exposures . before the observations of 2m1507 , @xmath10 spectra of sao159054 ( g2v )",
    "were obtained for transmission calibration .",
    "data reduction was carried out using iraf .",
    "argon lines were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "telluric absorption was removed by dividing each object spectrum with the corresponding g star spectrum after stellar absorption features had been removed .",
    "the result was multiplied by a blackbody spectrum whose temperature is that of the effective temperature of the g star . for flux calibration 2mass magnitudes",
    "were used to normalize the spectra .",
    "boxcar smoothing of 11 pixel wide ( slit width ) was applied before obtaining the final spectra .",
    "ircs is designed so that optical throughput of the wavelength regions where atmospheric transmission is poor is low .",
    "usable wavelength regions are 1.18 - 1.35 @xmath5 m , 1.49 - 1.81 @xmath5 m , and 1.95 - 2.4 @xmath5 m respectively at @xmath9 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "final spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "in figures 2 and 3 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 band spectra are normalized so that the portions of the spectra which are least affected by molecular absorption features overlap . to emphasize the locations of h@xmath6o and ch@xmath11 absorption features ,",
    "the spectra of gl 229b ( @xcite ) are also shown .    in figure 2 ,",
    "flux depression of 2m0920 ( solid line ) is conspicuous compared to the other two objects and the absorption maxima at 1.63 and 1.67 @xmath5 m due to ch@xmath11 2@xmath12 and @xmath13 bands are seen .",
    "these absorption features are also found in gl 229b and in the early t dwarf , sdss 1254 - 0122 ( @xcite ) . in figure 3 ,",
    "flux depression of 2m0920 due to methane extending from 2.15 @xmath5 m to longer wavelengths is obvious as is the 2.20 @xmath5 m absorption maximum of the @xmath12 band .",
    "since we have seen the methane features in an l6.5 dwarf , it is natural to revisit spectra of other l dwarfs .",
    "denis 0205 - 11ab ( l7v ) was the first l dwarf for which methane detection was suggested ( @xcite ) .",
    "denis 0205 - 11ab is the coolest of the first three l dwarfs discovered by denis .",
    "tokunaga and kobayashi ( 1999 ) obtained a @xmath1 band spectrum of this object , confirmed the flux depression longward of 2.2 @xmath5 m , but interpreted the feature as due to h@xmath6 cia .",
    "this object was also observed by leggett et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but none of the authors mention the methane detection . instead reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) comment on the influence of h@xmath6 cia on late l dwarfs referring to tokunaga and kobayashi ( 1999 ) .",
    "now we question the interpretation of the 2.2 @xmath5 m feature based on h@xmath6 cia .",
    "wavelength dependence of absorption produced by h@xmath6 cia was calculated by borysow and frommhold ( 1990 ) .",
    "one of the characteristics of this absorption is that it is spectrally broad .",
    "the absorption feature is not apparent within a narrow spectral coverage unlike the 2.2 @xmath5 m feature . if present",
    ", it should produce a large flux ratio between for example @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , but should not cause an abrupt change within the @xmath1 band .",
    "here we conclude that the interpretation of the 2.2 @xmath5 m feature as methane by delfosse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was correct .",
    "reid et al . ( 2001 ) present the @xmath10 spectra of 2mass 0310 + 16 ( l8v ) ( figure 8 of their paper ) . in the @xmath1 band spectrum of this object ,",
    "the 2.3 @xmath5 m co bandhead is very weak while the 2.2 @xmath5 m feature is strong .",
    "the weakness of co indicates that much of carbon is in ch@xmath11 .",
    "reid et al .",
    "interpret the 2.2 @xmath5 m feature as due to h@xmath6 cia , but we argue that the feature is naturally explained by methane .",
    "kirkpatrick et al . ( 1999 ) present the @xmath1 band spectra of 2mass 0850 + 10 ( l6v ) and 2mass 1632 + 19 ( l8v ) ( figure 5 of their paper ) .",
    "the 2.2 @xmath5 m feature is apparent especially in 2mass 0850 + 10 , but they deny the presence of methane .",
    "we again argue that the natural interpretation of this feature is methane absorption .",
    "the detection of methane in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands of 2m0920 complicates the definition of the l / t transition .",
    "2m0920 was classified as l6.5v by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2000 ) based on red optical spectroscopy . on the other hand , leggett et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that l / t transition objects which show methane in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands should be classified as early t dwarfs .",
    "the difficulty may be arising from the fact that while l dwarfs are defined in the optical wavelengths , t dwarfs are defined in the near infrared .",
    "methane can be formed at low temperatures near 1000k under high densities , and detection of methane in gl 229b was deemed as evidence for very low @xmath14 of this object ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was somewhat unexpected that methane was detected in l dwarfs by noll et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , even if the methane bands detected was the strong @xmath15 fundamental .",
    "it may appear to be more surprising that the weaker combination bands of methane at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath5 m are now detected in an l dwarf as shown in  3 .",
    "such new observations , however , may imply that our understanding of the photospheric structure of l dwarfs should radically be reconsidered .",
    "it was generally thought that the photospheres of l dwarfs are dusty .",
    "however , simple dusty models of case b ( @xcite ) , in which dust grains exist throughout the photosphere so long as the thermodynamical condition of condensation is fulfilled , can not explain the formation of the methane bands at all as shown in fig.4a .",
    "in fact , no trace of methane bands appears in any models of @xmath14 between 1500 and 1800k .",
    "the reason for this is that the strong extinction by dust masks the molecular bands on one hand and also the backwarming effect of dust grains makes the photosphere too warm for methane to form . on the other hand , dust segregated models ( case c ) , in which dust once formed has precipitated below the photosphere and volatile molecules",
    "dominate the observable photosphere , easily show methane bands at 2.2 @xmath5 m as shown in fig.4b . in this case",
    ", weak methane absorption appears already at @xmath16k and turns to be quite strong at the lower @xmath17 s ( note that the solid and dotted lines in fig.4 represent the cases with and without methane opacity , respectively ) .",
    "however , it is known that the infrared colors of such models are rather blue and incompatible with the observed red colors of l dwarfs .",
    "it is clear that none of these models of cases b and c offers an explanation for the presence of methane bands in l dwarfs .",
    "a new model was developed based on the idea that warm dust should exist deep in the photosphere ( @xcite ) , and the observed infrared colors of l dwarfs can reasonably be reproduced by the unified models with a thin dust layer deep in the photosphere ( tsuji 2001 ) . in these models , both dust formation and segregation processes",
    "are taken into account and the thin dust layer is generated naturally .",
    "the unified models are successful because the thin dust cloud is situated in the observable photosphere of l dwarfs and this fact explains why the infrared colors of l dwarfs are so red compared with those of t dwarfs in which the dust layer is situated too deep in the photosphere to give observable effects . at the same time , volatile molecules can reside in the upper photosphere above the dust cloud in l dwarfs and this opens a possibility for methane bands to be formed .",
    "we confirm that the methane bands near 2.2 @xmath5 m appear and can be predicted to be reasonably strong for models of @xmath17 below about 1600k as shown in fig.4c .",
    "thus only the unified model with @xmath17 between 1500 and 1600k offers a reasonable account for the presence of methane and , at the same time , for the red colors due to dust extinction .",
    "methane absorption features are present in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band spectra of 2m0920 ( l6.5 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 band methane feature is also seen in some other l dwarfs found in the literature .",
    "we have shown that objects that are optically classified as l can have methane absorption at 1@xmath182.5 @xmath5 m .",
    "the presence of methane in l dwarfs is consistent with the prediction of the unified models of tsuji ( 2001 ) in which the presence of a thin dust layer deep in the atmosphere is considered .",
