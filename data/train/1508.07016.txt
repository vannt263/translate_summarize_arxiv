    "the electroweak - scale right - handed neutrino ( ew - scale @xmath3 ) model was proposed by one of us ( pqh ) @xcite with the following main motivations in mind : 1 ) to provide a model for the see - saw mechanism which can be realized at the electroweak scale instead of a typical grand unification theory ( gut ) scale ; 2 ) to be able to test the seesaw mechanism through the discovery of right - handed neutrinos whose majorana masses are now bounded by the electroweak scale @xmath4 ; 3 ) to be able to probe at high energies ( e.g. at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ) lepton - number violating processes such as like - sign dilepton events coming from the majorana nature of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the electroweak - scale right - handed neutrinos belong to doublets of the standard model ( sm ) @xmath5 whose partners are right - handed ",
    "heavy \" mirror charged leptons .",
    "the requirement of the absence of anomaly dictates the addition of right - handed doublets of mirror quarks to the particle spectrum .",
    "furthermore , left - handed @xmath5-singlet mirror quarks and mirror charged leptons will be the counterparts of their sm right - handed @xmath5-singlet quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the ew - scale @xmath3 model entails extra @xmath5 chiral doublets ( the mirror fermions ) which have many consequences .",
    "these mirror fermions enter loop corrections to various quantities and processes such as the electroweak precision parameters , rare processes , etc .",
    "the first type of effects that needs to be examined is the contributions of these extra chiral doublets to the electroweak precision parameters .",
    "these calculations have been performed in @xcite and it was found that there is a large parameter space where the ew - scale @xmath3 model satisfies the ew precision constraints . in a nutshell ,",
    "the contributions from the mirror fermions are partially cancelled by those of the scalar sector , in particular the @xmath5 triplet scalar .",
    "the next place where mirror fermions enter through loop corrections is rare processes such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in @xcite ,",
    "such processes have been discussed in a generic fashion , with an emphasis on the possible correlation between the observability of the aforementioned rare processes and the decay lengths of the mirror charged leptons , both of which are of phenomenological interests . in this article , we will present an update of the process @xmath6 taking into account recent developments of the model , including experimental inputs from the recently - discovered 125 gev sm - like scalar @xcite .",
    "they are summarized below .",
    "the scalar sector of the original model @xcite contains one sm - like higgs doublet and two higgs triplets , one with @xmath8 containing doubly - charged scalars and one with @xmath9 .",
    "( the rationale for this sector will be explained in the summary section . )",
    "the discovery of the 125 gev sm - like scalar has opened up a whole new chapter on any model beyond the sm , in particular those models which have more than one higgs doublet . in light of this discovery , a close examination of the scalar sector of the ew - scale @xmath3 model",
    "@xcite revealed that its original higgs content is insufficient to accommodate the 125 gev sm - like scalar .",
    "it turns out that a simple introduction of an extra higgs doublet , now totaling two : one of which couples to the sm fermions and the other one to the mirror quarks and charged leptons .",
    "this yields two 125-gev candidates with one being sm - like ( dubbed _ dr .",
    "jekyll _ ) and the other being very different ( _ mr .",
    "hyde _ ) , both of which giving comparable signal strengths in agreement with atlas and cms data .",
    "most importantly for the present manuscript is the recent work @xcite concerning neutrino and sm charged lepton masses and mixings .",
    "the fact that the sm lepton mixing matrix @xmath10 ( the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix ) is so different from the quark counterpart , @xmath11 ( the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix ) , has given rise to many models , many of which invoke the presence of some kind of discrete symmetry . among these different proposals for the discrete symmetry",
    "is the popular @xmath1 symmetry which has been used to reproduce the tribimaximal form of @xmath10 .",
    "this symmetry is usually applied to the charged lepton sector @xcite and involves four or more higgs doublets .",
    "( such a large number of higgs doublets might be hard to accommodate the 125 gev sm - like scalar with the desired observed properties . )",
    "the new twist of @xcite is to exhibit the @xmath1 symmetry in the neutrino dirac mass sector and the scalar sector involved is composed of @xmath12-singlet scalars which are not constrained by lhc data .",
    "these singlet scalars are composed of a singlet and a triplet of @xmath1 .",
    "this model reproduces the desired pmns matrix and makes predictions on the charged lepton mass matrix in the form of @xmath13 .",
    "the singlet scalars play a crucial role in the process @xmath6 in the ew - scale @xmath3 model as shown in @xcite and updated below in light the aforementioned developments .",
    "the results presented in this paper contain a deep correlation between the branching ratio @xmath14 and the neutrino sector in the form of the pmns matrix for both normal and inverted hierarchies , as well as the form of the mirror lepton mixing matrix .",
    "it will be shown that the exclusion zones in the plots of the branching ratio of @xmath14 versus the yukawa coupling strengths to the singlets depend a bit on how strong the @xmath1-triplet scalars couple to the leptons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section ii , we summarize the essence of the ew - scale @xmath3 model ( original @xcite and extended @xcite ) .",
    "next , in section iii , we briefly review constraints from electroweak precision measurements for the original model and from higgs physics for the extended model . in section iv",

    "we then proceed with the actual calculations of the process @xmath15 , the anomalous magnetic dipole moment @xmath16 and the electric dipole moment @xmath17 for the lepton @xmath18 in section v. detailed numerical analysis will be presented in section vi .",
    "implications of our results concerning the possible detection of mirror leptons at the lhc and the ilc are discussed in section vii .",
    "we finally summarize and conclude in section viii .",
    "a few useful formulas are collected in an appendix .",

    "in this review section , we will discuss two sets of results for the ew - scale @xmath3 model obtained in @xcite ( the electroweak precision constraints ) and @xcite ( constraints from the 125-gev sm - like scalar ) .",
    "the presence of mirror quark and lepton @xmath5-doublets can , by themselves , seriously affect the constraints coming from electroweak precision data .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , the positive contribution to the s - parameter coming from the extra right - handed mirror quark and lepton doublets could be partially cancelled by the negative contribution coming from the triplet higgs fields .",
    "@xcite has carried out a detailed analysis of the electroweak precision parameters s and t and found that there is a large parameter space in the model which satisfies the present constraints and that there is _ no fine tuning _ due to the large size of the allowed parameter space .",

    "( [ fig4 ] ) ) to @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) ) , the red contours of @xmath111 of scenario 1 in the left and right panels in all these plots remain the same , while the blue contours of scenario 2 in the right panels move toward to the left .",
    "this indicates that noticeable differences in the contours of @xmath111 between the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies can be seen in these cases . in general",
    "the couplings are about an order of magnitude more sensitive in the inverted mass hierarchy than the normal one for scenario 2 .",
    "however , for @xmath135 , these differences diminish .",
    "* there are no discernible differences between the two mass hierarchies for the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment in both scenarios for all 6 cases of couplings .",
    "the constraints on the yukawa couplings coming from @xmath45 has several implications among which two are particularly relevant .",
    "* the size allowed for the yukawa couplings by present limits on @xmath123 has an important implication on the decay lengths of the mirror leptons .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this in detail here but a few remarks are in order . in the search for mirror leptons , one would like to look for characteristic signatures which can be distinguished from sm background .",
    "one of such signatures could be events with displaced vertices , in particular events with decay lengths which are macroscopic ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "how this type of events can be correlated to @xmath45 is a topic which was already mentioned in @xcite . with the present update which includes a more detailed analysis taking into account mixings in the lepton sector , one can have a better idea of the correlation between the feasibility to observe @xmath45 and the detection of mirror leptons . + a mirror lepton can decay directly into sm leptons with an accompanying higgs singlet .",
    "for example , one can have @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the decay length will depend on the magnitude of the yukawa couplings as well as on the various mixing parameters contained in eq .",
    "( [ totalls ] ) . we just take one example here for the sake of discussion .",

    "for instance , if one focuses on @xmath142 , and if @xmath143 , the constraint on @xmath144 ( see the above figures ) implies that @xmath145 would have a macroscopic decay length .",
    "there are many such cases but it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this issue at length .",
    "we merely point out the relationship between the constraints coming from @xmath45 and the implication on the search for mirror leptons . *",
    "the other implication concerns the vev of the singlet higgs fields .",
    "since the seesaw mechanism implies the masses of the light neutrinos are given by @xmath146 and with @xmath147 , it was stated in @xcite that @xmath148 and that the singlet vev @xmath149 if @xmath150 .",
    "however , constraints from @xmath45 imply @xmath144 which now brings the singlet vev up to @xmath151 .",
    "in fact it can even be of the order @xmath152 . from this observation , it is safe to say that there does not appear to be much of a hierarchy problem in the ew - scale @xmath3 model .",
    "in this work , we present an update on a previous analysis @xcite for the process @xmath2 performed in the original ew - scale @xmath3 model @xcite to an extended model @xcite .",
    "mixings effects of neutrinos and charged leptons constructed with a @xmath1 symmetry as recently studied in @xcite are also taken into account . in this context , the rare process @xmath2 is link to interesting new physics beyond the sm in the lepton sector , like neutrino and charged lepton mass mixings , neutrino mass hierarchies , mirror leptons as well as singlet and triplet scalars of @xmath1 , etc .",
    "the related muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment is also studied in detail for the model .    to summarize",
    ", we find that    * one can deduce more stringent constraints on the parameter space of the ew - scale @xmath3 model by using the lfv process @xmath2 than the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment . *",
    "the branching ratio @xmath123 shows some sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchies in scenario 2 but not scenario 1 , depending on the @xmath1 triplet coupling constants .",
    "however we are not advocating the use of the process @xmath2 to settle the issue of neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "after all , this is a rare process .",
    "* more stringent constraints can be deduced in scenario 1 than scenario 2 using @xmath123 . * future data from meg experiment with the projected sensitivity will impose further constraints on the parameter space of the model . *",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment is sensitive neither to the neutrino mass hierarchies nor the scenarios for all 6 cases of the couplings studied here for the model .",
    "searching for new physics via rare processes is complementary to direct production of new particles at colliders . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the relevant new particles in the model are the mirror leptons and scalar singlets running inside the loop diagram .",
    "as shown in our analysis , the yukawa couplings of the higgs singlets to the leptons in the ew - scale @xmath3 model are constrained to be small in order to be consistent with the current experimental limit on @xmath123 .",
    "thus searching for mirror particles of this model at the lhc would be quite interesting since , due to small couplings , they might decay outside the beam pipe and inside the silicon vertex detectors . the @xmath1 singlet and triplet",
    "scalars are likely to escape detection as missing energies .    as an outlook",
    ", one would like to generalize this work to @xmath153 conversion .",
    "this work is now in progress and will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for the general case of retaining the external fermion masses @xmath154 , the integrals @xmath155 and @xmath156 in eqs .",
    "( [ cl])-([cr ] ) have to be replaced by @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively , where @xmath159",
