    "the classical picture of the evolution of the velocity structure in the galactic disk is that stars are born within low - dispersion clusters from cool gas on near - circular orbits .",
    "these clusters evaporate and the stellar orbit distribution is heated through gravitational perturbations to the smooth disk potential . over time",
    "a stellar population s velocity dispersion grows and its mean motion lags behind that of pure circular orbits at the same galactocentric radius .",
    "thus , the velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood has been characterized as an ellipsoid whose centroid , size and orientation varies systematically with the lifetimes ( and hence colors ) of the stars under investigation ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "this field has undergone a recent renaissance with the release of the _ hipparcos _  data set of proper motions and parallaxes , measured with accuracies of a few milliarcseconds .",
    "studies using these data to analyze the local velocity distribution of stars can be broadly split into two categories :    first , there are determinations of the moments of the velocity distribution as a function of color assuming ( as above ) that it can be described by a mean velocity and a single velocity dispersion tensor @xcite .",
    "these have led to more stringent limits on the solar motion relative to a ( hypothetical ) zero - dispersion population ( the local standard of rest ) , the age of the galactic disk and rate of heating of stellar populations @xcite .",
    "secondly , there are non - parametric derivations of the full three dimensional velocity distribution function @xcite .",
    "these have revealed that the velocity distribution is poorly described by a single ellipsoid ; in fact it contains significant structures on smaller velocity scales .",
    "importantly , the structures do not seem to be dominated by short - lived stars .",
    "these structures can be variously interpreted as trails from evaporating clusters @xcite , or overdensities induced by resonances in the disk associated with the bar @xcite and/or spiral arms @xcite .",
    "our long - term goal is to pursue the latter category of project ; _ i.e. _ , to develop algorithms to locate , understand the significance of , and characterize , nontrivial structures in the velocity distribution , not just in the local galaxy but in the galaxy halo .",
    "these projects will require new space - based astrometry data ( _ e.g. _ , what we expect from the upcoming gaia mission ) in combination with large ground - based surveys ( _ e.g. _ , sloan digital sky survey , @xcite ; two - micron all - sky survey , @xcite ; grid giant star survey , @xcite ) .",
    "in the short term , we have begun by analyzing the _ hipparcos _  data set with a very general algorithm for fitting distribution functions to data measured with nontrivial error covariances and missing information .    from a computer science or nonlinear statistics perspective ,",
    "these problems fall into the category of `` missing data '' problems , in which one constructs a model of an object ( here the velocity distribution function ) using data points ( here tangential velocities ) every one of which is incomplete ( because , in this case , it has no radial information ) .",
    "we present a framework for a large set of algorithms for solving such problems , and the details of the specific restriction to the velocity distribution function as measured with velocities projected onto the sphere .    in this paper",
    "we further restrict our attention on the trial problem of re - deriving the properties of the velocity ellipsoid near the sun . in what follows",
    ", it is assumed that any color - selected , kinematically unbiased sample of stars has a velocity distribution function which can be modeled ( for the purposes of measuring its velocity variance ) by a sum of two gaussan ellipsoids , one for `` halo stars '' and one for `` disk stars '' , and later , by a sum or mixture of @xmath1 gaussian ellipsoids .",
    "model parameters are chosen to maximize the total likelihood of the _ hipparcos _  measurements ( which , in this case , are two - dimensional tangential velocity vectors ) , given their uncertainties ( which are two - dimensional covariance tensors ) ; _ i.e. _ , the results presented here represent the optimization of an explicit , justified , scalar objective function .",
    "our work differs from previous work in several respects : we have the scalar objective function , we present tests of the algorithm with relatively realistic artificial data , and we relax the gaussian assumption ( _ i.e. _ , expand the space of allowed distribution functions ) .",
    "in later papers in this series , we intend to generalize our parameterization ( to multi - modal disk distributions ) , locate velocity - space structures , measure their statistical significance , and characterize their properties .",
    "this phenomenology will be essential for distinguishing the various pictures for the origin of the velocity sub - structure in the galaxy disk .",
    "in what follows the standard galactic velocity coordinate system is used , with directions @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( and associated unit vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) pointing towards the galactic center , pointing in the direction of circular orbital motion , and pointing towards the north galactic pole , respectively .",
    "vectors will be implicitly defined to be column matrices , so @xmath8 is the scalar product and @xmath9 is a rank-2 tensor .",
    "the components @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 of a velocity @xmath13 are conventionally named `` @xmath14 '' , `` @xmath15 '' , and `` @xmath16 '' .",
    "we treat any color - selected population of stars from _ hipparcos _  as being composed of two kinematically distinct populations of stars , a `` halo '' population with velocity distribution described by a gaussian ellipsoid in velocity space with a mean velocity @xmath17 with respect to the sun and velocity dispersion ( variance ) tensor @xmath18 , with these parameters fixed at @xmath19\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}}}\\nonumber \\\\ { { { \\mathbf{v}}}_\\mathrm{\\!halo}}&= & [ 100~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]^2\\ ,              [ { { \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}}}\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle \\top}}+{{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}}}\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle \\top}}+{{\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}}}\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle \\top } } ] \\label{eq : haloparameters}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite , plus a `` disk '' population described by another gaussian ellipsoid with mean @xmath20 and dispersion tensor @xmath21 , both of which are allowed to vary arbitrarily . the relative amplitude @xmath22 of the halo gaussian ( _ i.e. _ , the fraction of stars in the halo ) is also allowed to vary arbitrarily .",
    "sensitivity of the results to the assumed halo velocity dispersion of @xmath23 is discussed below .    the vast majority ( @xmath24  percent ) of the sample is expected to be members of the disk population .",
    "however , the inclusion of a halo gaussian prevents halo stars from distorting the measurement of the disk velocity variance . in effect , the halo gaussian `` clips out '' velocity outliers in a responsible way .",
    "almost all the difficulty in inferring the parameters of this model , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 ( three parameters ) , @xmath21 ( six parameters ) , and the relative responsibility of the halo gaussian ( one parameter ) , comes from the fact that _ hipparcos _  does not measure the total three - space velocity @xmath13 of each star , but only its two - dimensional tangential projection .",
    "the approach developed here is extremely general and can be applied to many different density estimation tasks in the presence of partially observed data .",
    "the assumption is that there are low - dimension observations @xmath25 , which are noisy projections of higher - dimension `` true values '' @xmath26 : @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are known , non - square ( or zero - determinant ) projection matrices , and the noise is drawn from a gaussian with zero mean and known ( low - dimension ) covariance tensor @xmath29 .",
    "it is also assumed that the @xmath26 are drawn independently and identically distributed from a probability distribution function @xmath30 in the higher - dimension space .",
    "the goal is to fit a model for @xmath30 using only the incomplete observations @xmath31 , their covariances @xmath32 and the projection matrices @xmath33 .",
    "note that there is no assumption that all data points have similar non - square projection matrices ; in fact the projection matrices ( and thus the observations ) may have different dimensionalities .",
    "the density model @xmath30 is parameterized as a mixture of @xmath34 gaussians :    @xmath35    where the amplitudes or `` rates '' @xmath36 sum to unity and the function @xmath37 is the normal ( gaussian ) distribution with mean @xmath38 and variance tensor @xmath39 .    for a known projection matrix @xmath28 and noise covariance @xmath29 in @xmath40 space ( the lower - dimensional space of the observations ) each component of the mixture",
    "marginalizes to a lower - dimensional gaussian , and so the induced density is a conditional mixture of gaussians on @xmath40 : @xmath41 where functions like @xmath42 are joint probability distribution functions of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , and functions like @xmath43 are probability distribution functions of @xmath2 given ( or at a specific value of ) @xmath3 .",
    "all other symbols are described above , except @xmath44 , which is the combined variance for each measurement @xmath45 under the assumption that it is drawn from gaussian @xmath46 , with part of the variance coming from the ( projected ) variance @xmath47 of the gaussian , and part coming from the measurement uncertainty variance @xmath29 .",
    "this model will be called the `` projected mixture of gaussians '' model hereafter .",
    "the objective of the fitting procedure is to maximize the conditional likelihood of the entire set of low - dimensional projected observations given the nonsquare matrices and the error covariances .",
    "in particular , we are fitting for the means @xmath48 , variance tensors @xmath49 and amplitudes @xmath50 of the mixture of gaussians in the high - dimensional ( unobserved ) space . assuming the noise on each observation is independent of other observation noises this ( log ) likelihood is @xmath51    the model parameters can be optimized in several ways .",
    "one approach is to directly compute gradients and use a generic optmizer to ascend the objective ; this is complicated by restrictions on the parameters ( e.g. the variances must be symmetric and positive - definite , the amplitudes must be non - negative and sum to unity ) .",
    "another approach is to view the high - dimensional quantities as hidden variables and use the expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm @xcite to iteratively maximize the likelihood function .",
    "we take the latter approach ; for details see the appendix .",
    "the sample used in this study is a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 nearby main - sequence stars @xcite from the _ hipparcos _  catalog @xcite , all chosen to have parallaxes measured at @xmath52 .",
    "we made no corrections for galactic rotation ( since this study is simply of stellar velocities relative to the sun ) ; indeed we did no processing or correction of the _ hipparcos _  data beyond making the sample cut .",
    "the `` low dimension '' data @xmath25 referred to above are the measured tangential components of each star s `` high dimension '' true three - dimensional velocity @xmath26 , with @xmath53 \\;\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath28 are non - square or zero - determinant matrices , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the tangential unit vectors pointing in the galactic latitude and longitude directions for each star .",

    "this calculation ignores the lutz - kelker bias @xcite , but this is small for the sample used here . since the _ hipparcos _  catalog reports proper motions in equatorial rather than galactic coordinates , the above requires a rotation depending on each star s angular position on the sky and the epoch ( 1991.25 ) of the catalog positions .",
    "the _ hipparcos _  catalog entries , which can be represented by some vector @xmath62 for each star , come with single - star uncertainty covariance matrices @xmath63 .",
    "if we can represent the derivative of the @xmath25 with respect to the catalog entries @xmath62 by a matrix @xmath64 @xmath65 then the measurement uncertainty covariances @xmath29 for the @xmath25 are given by @xmath66 this is accurate only in the limit of small parallax errors , which is fine for this sample .",
    "in addition , this whole procedure ignores star - to - star covariances , which could be significant , but which are not reported in the _ hipparcos _  catalog .",
    "following the general approach of @xcite , 20 color - selected subsamples of stars ( @xmath67 stars each ) were made by cutting the color - sorted star list into equal - sized pieces ( as closely as possible ) , and , for each subsample , the 10 parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 were found by the optimization described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsr_1_parameters ] shows the 10 parameters for each of the 20 subsamples .",
    "the vertical error - bars on the points indicate uncertainties computed with 20 independent bootstrap resamplings of the data in each of the subsamples .",

    ". the points in figure  [ fig : lsr_1_lsr ] have significant uncertainties in both dimensions , so fitting a line responsibly is not trivial . for this purpose",
    "we use again the projected mixtures of gaussians procedure described above , but now there are 19 2-dimensional data points @xmath25 , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the same ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath28 are the identity matrices ) , and we only fit a single gaussian ellipsoid . the straight line shown in the @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) panel of figure  [ fig : lsr_1_lsr ] is the principal eigenvector of the best - fit gaussian .",

    "i.e. _ , for artificial subsamples with mean color @xmath83 , the variance tensor was made to vary quadratically with color , so as to approximate the appearance of the true observations ( and span the range of observed variance tensors .",

    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : lsr_1fake_parameters ] and [ fig : lsr_1fake_lsr ] , along with the input values used to make the artificial data .",
    "the best - fit parameters are , except for a couple of samples , within one standard deviation of the input paramters .",
    "more importantly for present purposes , the lsr is very well determined ; the algorithm returns the correct lsr velocity to well within one standard deviation .",
    "we conclude that the algorithm is not significantly biased .",
    "perhaps the biggest limitation of lsr measurements like this one is that the disk velocity distribution function is far from gaussian ; it is not even unimodal @xcite ; one of the primary goals of our future work is to explore the complexities of disk star velocities . as a baby step towards checking the influence of disk velocity non - gaussianity on the lsr determination ,",
    "the model was generalized to allow for not just one gaussian ellipsoid to fit the each color subsample s disk velocity distribution function but @xmath84 gaussians , all constrained to have the same mean . models with @xmath84 have the freedom to have larger `` tails '' to the velocity distribution , and for those tails to be rotated or twisted in velocity space relative to the core of the velocity distribution",

    ", the data will be `` overfit '' . to determine the optimal value of @xmath87 for each of the 20 stellar subsamples ( the optimal @xmath87 will , in general , be different for different subsamples , of course ) , a `` jackknife likelihood '' was computed : for each of 5  iterations , a randomly selected 10  percent of each subsample was removed and put aside as a `` test set . ''",
    "fitting ( _ i.e. _ , parameter determination by maximum likelihood ) was performed on the remaining 90  percent , and the likelihood of the test set was tested within the context of the best - fit model .",
    "the logarithms of the jackknife likelihoods for the five iterations were averaged and the @xmath87 with the best jackknife likelihood was chosen for each subsample .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsr_bestngauss_lsr ] shows the lsr determination when the generalized model is used and each sample is fit with the optimal jackknife likelihood value of @xmath87 .",
    "the velocity of the sun relative to the lsr we find when using the optimal @xmath87 values is @xmath88\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}}}+ [ 4.0\\pm0.8~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}}}+ [ 6.7\\pm0.2~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}}}\\;\\;\\;.\\ ] ] this is extremely similar to ( much closer than 1 standard deviation away from ) that found using @xmath85 ( figure  [ fig : lsr_1_lsr ] ) .",
    "this suggests that that the assumption of gaussianity is not strongly affecting the results .",
    "in the above , we developed and used a novel algorithm to infer the three - dimensional velocity distribution from a kinematically unbiased sample of _ hipparcos _  stars .",
    "the local velocity dispersion is a strong function of stellar color , and the mean velocity of a color - selected stellar population is a linear function of its velocity variance ; this confirms previous results ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "the extrapolation of this relation to zero velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , which is found to be @xmath77\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}}}+ [ 4.0\\pm0.8~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}}}+ [ 6.7\\pm0.2~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}}}\\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are unit vectors pointing in the directions of the standard galactic velocity components @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "this result is similar to previouw lsr determinations ; we compare this result to one previous study below .",
    "our answer did not change much when we relaxed the assumption that the disk star velocity distributions can be modeled as gaussians .",
    "we also showed that it is possible to robustly and reliably solve a missing data problem in astrophysics : the reconstruction of aspects of the three - dimensional velocity distribution function from individual velocity measurements every one of which is missing data in the radial direction .",
    "@xcite , using the same subsample of the same data set , find a somewhat different solar velocity relative to the lsr ; they find @xmath89\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}}}+ [ 5.25\\pm0.62~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}}}+ [ 7.17\\pm0.38~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}]\\,{{\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}}}\\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] they also find a lower mean velocity variance for the long - lived disk stars .",
    "these two differences are probably related , since the lsr is determined by fitting the relationship between velocity and velocity variance .",
    "although the studies agree to within about one standard deviation , better agreement might be expected since both studies are using identical data subsets of the same data set .",
    "both studies have made the incorrect assumption that the stellar velocity distribution is gaussian ; @xcite did so in subtracting a measurement uncertainty variance from the measured velocity variance .",
    "the method presented here has been shown ( using the generalized multi - gaussian disk model ) to be insensitive to the gaussianity of the velocity distribution .",
    "the incorrect assumption of gaussianity , entering differently in the @xcite investigation , may account for the difference between the results . because our method involves the optimization of a well - defined objective , because we have tested our method successfully with artificial data , and because we have been able to relax the gaussian assumption , we prefer our result .",
    "certainly the differences show that stellar velocity studies have become precise enough that algorithms matter .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that the true velocity distribution is far from a unimodal gaussian @xcite , so it is not clear that it is possible to make a `` correct '' lsr determination at all .",
