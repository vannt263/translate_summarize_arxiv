    "the vortex phase diagram in type ii superconductors has been extensively studied in relation to the high @xmath0 cuprates in magnetic fields which is a typical three dimensional ( 3d ) system with strong fluctuation .",
    "the vortex lattice melting transition in 3d systems in clean limit has been examined as a first step for understanding phenomena in real superconductors with quenched disorder and is now believed to be of first order in any magnetic field . in contrast , understanding of the phase diagram in 2d case in nonzero magnetic fields have not progressed sufficiently .",
    "this is partly because the resulting vortex lattice itself is nonsuperconducting .",
    "no state with zero resistance is reached @xcite in clean limit .",
    "further , a weak but nonvanishing disorder destroys the quasi long range order of vortex positions , and a vortex glass , i.e , a superconducting vortex phase , is never realized at finite temperatures , implying that there will be no phase transition in _ real _ 2d superconductors with disorder in finite fields and finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , the field - temperature vortex phase diagram in a 2d superconductor remains unresolved even theoretically .",
    "based on the elastic theory , there are at least two possibilities , a direct first order melting and the defect - unbinding melting composed of two consecutive continuous transitions and a hexatic liquid crystal phase intervening between them @xcite . in high fields",
    "where the pair - field @xmath1 is limited to the modes in the lowest landau level ( ll ) , however , the 2d melting transition is of first order according to the direct monte carlo simulation of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model @xcite .",
    "then , it will be valuable to clarify whether this first order transition is changed to the consecutive continuous melting scenario in lower fields or not .",
    "in fact , the character of the melting transition has been assumed in previous studies to be independent of the strength @xmath2 of the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , when considering the real disordered case , clarifying this issue on the field dependence of the melting mechanism would improve understanding of the 2d vortex states in the following sense : in _ real _ superconducting thin films with _",
    "weak _ quenched disorder , a first order melting in clean limit is not suggested in thermodynamic and resistive data .",
    "note that such experiments are usually performed in much lower fields than @xmath3 where roles of quenched disorder are believed to be weaker @xcite .",
    "the fact that no first order melting has been suggested so far in physical quantities in real 2d thin films might be understood if the melting transition in clean limit is continuous or a highly weak first order one in such lower fields .",
    "based on such a background on the 2d vortex states , in the present work , the previous numerical analysis limited to the lll modes of @xmath1 is extended to the case with several higher ll modes to address the nature of the vortex lattice melting in the gl model in lower fields .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    returning to fig.1 , one can see that the magnitude of the hysteresis in the simulations including higher lls has a different field dependence from that in the lll approximation .",
    "the hysteresis curves following only from lll indicate that , as is seen from the upper figures in figs.1 and 3 , the hysteresis accompanying the transition increases with decreasing @xmath75 .",
    "once the higher lls are incorporated , however , the hysteresis peak at the transition rather decreases with decreasing @xmath75 , implying a reduction of the first order character of the melting transition in lower fields .",
    "of course , this field dependence correlates with the corresponding @xmath75-dependence of the difference in the @xmath73-value between the lll curve ( dashed curve ) and the solid one .",
    "however , this trend that the first order transition is weakened by decreasing the field is interesting in that it suggests the possibility that , in lower fields , the first order melting might be transmuted to the two - step continuous melting scenairio @xcite . to clarify this possibility within our gl study ,",
    "the corresponding hysteresis curves in lower fields are shown in fig.3 together with the @xmath75-dependence of the peak height of hysteresis at @xmath73 ( fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "although the hysteresis reduces with decreasing field even for lower @xmath75 ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , the data suggest that the reduction of hysteresis saturates with vanishing @xmath75 .",
    "this saturation of the peak height does not seem to be an artifact due to the limitation to the lls with @xmath72 : an additional ( dashed ) hysteresis curve for @xmath61 obtained by including the @xmath109 ll further is presented in fig.3 ( a ) . although the transition point has been slightly shifted to a lower temperasture by the @xmath103 ll which , as mentioned earlier , affects the elastic energy of the mean field vortex lattice , the hysteresis at @xmath73 is slightly bigger by including the @xmath103 ll .",
    "therefore , based on the present simulation , we argue that the melting transition remains of first order even in low field limit , although its first order character is significantly weakened with decreasing the field .",

    "the bottom figure is the zoom of the region specified by a square in the middle one at @xmath110 and shows the presence of one antivortex ( circle ) with a clock - wise circular current in contrast to others with a counterclock - wise circular current .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    next , we explain the vortex states at various @xmath76-values seen in our simulation using the lls @xmath59 . in fig.4 , we have shown snapshots of the distributions of the order parameter amplitude @xmath111 ( upper figures ) and the gauge - invariant gradient @xmath112 of the phase @xmath113 of @xmath22 ( middle and lower ones ) . before discussing what the figures imply , the relation between @xmath22 and the vortices in the lll approximation will be reviewed .",
    "as is well known , the order parameter within the lll satisfies @xcite @xmath114 in the present gauge @xmath115 , where the function @xmath116 is any @xmath117-th order polynomial of @xmath118 .",
    "thus , @xmath119 has @xmath15 zero points @xmath120 and takes the product form @xmath121 $ ] then , it is staightforward to show that the phase @xmath113 of @xmath119 satisfies the topological condition @xmath122 implying each zero point of @xmath123 is a vortex coordinate .",
    "equation ( [ topo ] ) implies that , in @xmath119 , all of the @xmath15 zero points of @xmath123 corresponds to the field - induced vortices and thus that no antivortices can appear .",
    "that is , the thermally - induced vortex pairs are described not by the lll modes but only by the higher ll modes of @xmath22 @xcite . bearing this role of the higher lls in mind ,",
    "one finds in fig.4 where @xmath61 that , below @xmath124 , the antivortices do not appear . as is seen in the bottom figure , appearance of an antivortex and thus , of one vortex pair induced by the thermal fluctuation is verified just above @xmath124 . by similarly defining the temperature ,",
    "at which the thermal vortex - pairs begin to appear , at different @xmath75-values , we obtain the crossover line , shown in fig.2 as the thick dotted line , which separates the vortex liquid composed only of the field - induced vortices from the state with the thermally - induced antivortices .",
    "this result is consistent with the picture argued elsewhere @xcite that the higher lls with antivortices included become more important at higher temperatures and push the melting transition curve down to lower temperatures ( see fig.2 ( a ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that , as is seen at the top of fig.4 , the snapshot taken just at @xmath125 does not include any dislocation .",
    "this is strange at least within the conventional picture based on the elastic theory that the melting transition is driven , more or less , by thermally - induced dislocations @xcite . from the figure",
    ", we feel that spatial variations of the amplitude @xmath111 of the pair - field assist the nearly harmonic shear elastic modes and that their cooperative roles result in the melting of the vortex lattice .",
    "this view arguing the necessity of the amplitude fluctuation does not contradict the conventional wisdom that goldstone modes in an ordered phase can not become critical modes for driving a thermal disordering . nevertheless , we have to mention that it is beyond the scope of the present work to judge whether such a role of the fluctuation of the amplitude @xmath111 is essential or an artifact of the use of the gl model which is usually valid when @xmath111 is small .",
    "in the present work , numerical simulations of the gl model with not only the order parameter modes in lll but also those in five or six higher lls have been performed .",
    "it has been found that the nearly vertical melting curve , which has been identified so far with the result following from the elastic model in the london limit , is obtained simply by incorporating the lower five higher lls which do _ not _ contribute to the elastic model , and that the first order character of the melting transition diminishes with decreasing the field , although the melting picture with two continuous transitions @xcite is not reached even in the low field limit .",
    "the weaker first order transition in lower fields suggests that the discontinuous nature of the transition in clean limit is easily lost by a weak pinning effect in real systems with quenched disorder and thus , explains why the first order melting transition has not been reflected , e.g. , in transport data in real superconducting films in nonzero field @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the present result in the gl model showing a small but nonzero hysteresis at the melting transition in any magnetic field , a simulation work @xcite has recently been reported indicating a continuous melting transition . there , the authors have discretized the relation @xmath126 , justified @xcite within the _ linear _ elastic theory , between the shear displacement @xmath127 and the phase fluctuation @xmath128 to invoke a starting lattice model for their numerical studies .",
    "however , their starting model includes phase slips in the @xmath129-direction and the direction perpendicular to this on the same footing , suggesting that thermally - induced vortex pairs coexist with the thermally - induced dislocation pairs .",
    "that is , the model in ref.@xcite is not compatible with the gl model in which the vortex pairs never appear close to the melting transition ( see fig.2 ) , and thus , it is not surprising that the present results are not consistent with the continuous transition @xcite found in a model which , in our opinion , is incompatible with the original gl model .",
    "on the other hand , we do not definitely conclude at this stage the absence of the low field regime in which the melting transition is continuous @xcite with no thermally - induced vortex pairs .",
    "more or less , the main drawback of the present work is the use of the gl model in addressing the low field regime . in such low fields and low temperatures ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath111 is rigid enough to justify the phase - only model ( with no thermally - induced vortex pairs ) . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the nearly vertical melting curve in low fields expected from theoretical arguments is obtained simply by taking account of five or six higher lls modes suggests that the results are not significantly affected by the truncation of the number of incorporated lls .",
    "nevertheless , further theoretical progress will be necessary to resolve this issue on the character of the transition .",
