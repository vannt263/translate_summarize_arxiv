    "spin valve type magnetic junctions are of very interest for investigations and subsequent applications .",
    "a number of significant effects were predicted and experimentally revealed in the junctions last years .",
    "magnetization instability was predicted in refs .  .",
    "the instability is driven by the current perpendicular to plane ( cpp regime ) due to near interface transformation of a transverse part of mobile electron spin flux to the lattice magnetization flux .",
    "this mechanism is usually referred to as a surface _ transverse spin transfer _ ( tst ) torque .",
    "another mechanism was proposed and theory elaborated in refs .  .",
    "this second mechanism is due to nonequilibrium _ longitudinal spin injection _ ( lsi ) by current into the bulk of a ferromagnetic layer .",
    "the injected spins create current dependent _ sd _ exchange in nature effective field , which acts on the lattice magnetization and may stimulate reorientation phase transition .",
    "theory of the joint action of the two mechanisms mentioned was developed recently  @xcite ( see also preprints  @xcite and ref .  ) .",
    "current driven instability was revealed experimentally , being manifested in resistance jumps  @xcite and in microwave emission .",
    "@xcite many interesting subsequent experiments confirmed the first observations in principle and gave a lot of additional significant information ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . the most of experiments considered trilayers co / cu / co as a constitutive working part of the junction",
    "the first co layer has usually pinned lattice due to large its own thickness or existence of additional pinning layers .",
    "the second co layer is taken thin enough to have free lattice magnetization , which may be controlled by external field or current .",
    "it is significant to remark that thickness @xmath6 of the second free layer can not be done less than @xmath7 to prevent a non - continuous structure appearing .",
    "@xcite typically , the thicknesses in experiments were chosen within the range @xmath810 nm .",
    "success in experimental study and in applications stimulated an activity to achieve more detailed understanding of the fundamental idea of tst process introduced in refs .  .",
    "contrary to this , in the present paper we accept this idea without any additional proof : an abrupt transformation appears of transverse mobile electron spin flux to the lattice magnetization flux at the interface between the layers .",
    "great attention was paid already to justify this idea more rigorously starting from the microscopy theory approach ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . however , the phenomenological approach is necessary also because of its more wide sight .",
    "exactly such an approach we laid in the basis of the present paper .",
    "in other words , we accept the mobile electrons can not perform long time and long distance precession around the lattice magnetization because of phase mismatch of individual electrons due to their statistical velocity spread.@xcite as a result , the transverse component of the mobile electron magnetization vector decays rapidly and transfers to the lattice of ferromagnet .",
    "this picture is taken as the base of our consideration and then all the phenomenology is built up .",
    "such an approach allows us to integrate in the theory the second mechanism of current action that is lsi .",
    "therefore the lsi effective field and tst torque are treated simultaneously as the two manifestations of the only _ sd _ exchange interaction .",
    "additionally , we shall show such significant effects as the backward current switching and the hysteretic resistance versus current dependence may be understood as a fine interplay of the two mechanisms mentioned .",
    "as far as we know , similar unified description including the both mechanisms , tst and lsi , could not developed yet in the frame of a microscopic theory .",
    "moreover , we calculate in the present paper not only the threshold current ( that was done in many papers ) but the property of the various magnetic configurations : what configurations remain stable and what ones become unstable depending on the current .",
    "similar experimental data were presented in the literature before and we have now a possibility to compare some of them with the theory .",
    "we show ( similar to refs .  )",
    "the spin wave spectrum of the junction layer should soften to zero under the current is growing and tends to the instability threshold .",
    "that is decisive manifestation of the lsi mechanism , which specifies it in comparison with the tst one .",
    "we estimate also the rise time for the unstable fluctuations",
    ". the minimal rise time may be less than @xmath9 but only if the lsi mechanism of instability is dominated .",
    "let us make some more preliminary remarks .",
    "the first remark concerns to the model of the system under consideration . according to the original estimations  @xcite and subsequent theory calculations ,  @xcite",
    "the depth of transverse spin flux penetration into the free layer is of the order of electron quantum wavelength at the fermi surface @xmath103 nm and is strongly nonuniform within this interval .",
    "the spin transfer torque acts , as it is well known ,  @xcite in that interval only .",
    "therefore the uniform approximation of the torque throughout the whole thickness @xmath6 seems to be very approximate at least for large enough @xmath1110 nm . because of the model of the torque , which is uniformly spread in the free layer , is traditional one , it needs , at least , to be justified . recently  @xcite we proposed another model for the calculations , namely , to consider spin transfer torque as a boundary condition at the pinned / free layer interface .",
    "in essence , this model is an opposite limiting case with respect to the uniform torque model .",
    "the obvious advantage of our model is in its complete non - sensitivity to details of the processes inside the sublayer adjusted to the interface and having thickness @xmath12 .",
    "more detailed comparison of these two models will be discussed in appendix .",
    "the second remark concerns to the external magnetic field influence .",
    "we assume the junction may be placed in some external magnetic field @xmath13 , which lies in the plane of junction interfaces . but",
    "this field is supposed to be less in magnitude in comparison with the layer magnetic anisotropy field @xmath14 , that is @xmath15 .",
    "such a supposition is accepted for simplicity because we want focus our attention here to current ( not to field ) driven magnetization reversal processes .",
    "recent papers  @xcite show at large enough fields @xmath16 the situation may become much more complicated .",
    "we will use further the most elementary model of a ferromagnetic metal based on the well known concept of free _",
    "s_-electron ( quasiparticle ) ideal gas interacting with the lattice bound _ d_-electron magnetization due to the so called _ sd _ exchange interaction .  @xcite some more advanced ( and more complicated ! ) models may be used , of course . however , on our opinion , the most actual problem now is to explain a number of experimental facts concerning to switching of ferromagnetic nanojunctions .",
    "we believe it may be done in the frame of the simple model .",
    "we assume the junction consists of two ferromagnetic metal layers and one very thin nonmagnetic spacer in between ( shown as a heavy line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to close the electric circuit , a nonmagnetic metal layer *",
    "3 * is necessary .",
    "the ferromagnetic metal layer * 1 * has pinned orientation of the lattice magnetization @xmath17 , but the mobile electron magnetization @xmath18 is , in general , non - pinned .",
    "another ferromagnetic metal layer * 2 * has free lattice magnetization @xmath19 and mobile electron magnetization @xmath20 , so that the magnetizations direction can be changed by an external magnetic field @xmath21 or spin - polarized current density @xmath22 .",
    "plane @xmath23 is the interface between the layers * 1 * and * 2 * and lattice magnetization @xmath17 lies within the plane .",
    "vectors @xmath17 and @xmath19 make an angle @xmath24 of an arbitrary value under the current is absent , that is under @xmath25 . after the current is turned on , the electrons flow from the layer * 1 * into the layer * 2 * or vise versa and then appear in a non - stationary quantum state and `` walk '' between the spin energy subbands of the corresponding layer . for forward",
    "current , when the inequality @xmath26 is valid , vectors @xmath20 and @xmath19 perform a precession ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . as it was shown first in refs .  ,",
    "angle of the precession decreases with coordinate @xmath27 increasing and tends to zero at @xmath28 , where @xmath12 is an electron quantum wavelength at the fermi surface .",
    "this is because of electron velocity statistical spread and no relaxation processes are needed to provide such a behavior .",
    "more detailed discussion may be found also in the recent preprint .",
    "@xcite analogous `` precession '' region appears , of course , near the interface @xmath23 for backward electron current , that is for @xmath29 .",
    "however , the region will be localized not in the layer * 1 * but again in the region @xmath30 of the layer * 2*. it appears due to the complete pinning of the lattice in the layer * 1*. this feature is better to discuss a little below in the paper .",
    "the region @xmath30 was introduced firstly by slonczewski  @xcite and berger  @xcite and further we will refer to it as `` sb layer '' .",
    "their considerations of the layer were based on the assumption that a ballistic transport occurs inside .",
    "an opposite limiting case , when diffusion transport dominates , was considered in refs .  .",
    "we follow , in this point , the approach of the original works .",
    "@xcite the validity criterion for this assumption may be written as @xmath31 , where momentum mean free pass length @xmath32 may be estimated as @xmath3310 nm for metals at room temperature .",
    "as for the region @xmath34 in the layer * 2 * , the length @xmath32 appears indeed very small one . based on this reason , we will consider further the electron transport outside the sb layer ( in the depth of the layer * 2 * ) using the diffusion  drift limit .",
    "quantities that have no number indexes ( 1 , 2 or 3 ) we refer further to any of the junction layers .",
    "motion of vector @xmath35 will be described by means of the landau ",
    "gilbert ( llg ) continuity equation : @xmath36-\\frac{\\kappa } { m}\\left[\\mathbf{m},\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{m } } { \\partial t}\\right]=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is time , @xmath38 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath1 is dimensionless lattice damping constant ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 is effective field , @xmath41 is anisotropy field , @xmath42 being dimensionless anisotropy constant ( typically , @xmath43 for our magnets ) and @xmath44 being a unit vector along the anisotropy axis direction , @xmath45 is the intralattice inhomogeneous exchange constant ( magnetic `` stiffness '' of the lattice ) , @xmath46 is demagnetization field , @xmath47 is _ sd _ exchange effective field .",
    "the latter takes the form  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a variational derivative , and @xmath50 is _ sd _ exchange energy , @xmath51 parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 being dimensionless _",
    "sd _ exchange constants ( typical estimations are @xmath54@xmath55 ) . due to the last term in eq .  , the motion of vectors @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 appears to be coupled .",
    "remember , vector @xmath17 is pinned completely in our model and can not be moved .",
    "we describe the motion of vector @xmath56 by means of continuity equation @xmath57+\\frac{\\mathbf{m}-\\bar{\\mathbf{m}}}{\\tau}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a time of relaxation to the local equilibrium value @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the unit vector , @xmath61 is a mobile electron magnetization flux density .",
    "we do not consider here the almost ballistic quantum mechanical motion of the mobile electrons inside the sb layer .",
    "instead , we consider the influence of this small thickness layer on the motion outside it by means of an appropriate boundary condition ( see below ) . diffusion ",
    "drift approximation is applicable in the regions outside sb layer , that is for @xmath34 .",
    "the equation   may be simplified significantly in this region .",
    "first , only longitudinal part @xmath62 may be taken into account .",
    "therefore an effective frequency @xmath63 of the motion is determined by the precession in relatively small fields @xmath64 .",
    "we assume the condition @xmath65 is valid , which allows us to neglect time derivative in eq .",
    "[ 5 ] in comparison with the relaxation term .",
    "the remaining equation   may be solved then with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "let us take the typical parameter estimations : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 to justify the following simplifying condition : @xmath70 then eq .   acquires the form @xmath71    second , spin flux @xmath61 can be found explicitly in the region @xmath34 to substitute it into eq .  .",
    "electrons in the region occupy energy subbands having their own spin magnetic moments parallel to @xmath72 and antiparallel to @xmath73 .",
    "magnetization of the mobile electrons @xmath56 contains contributions from the both subbands and therefore may be presented as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is bohr magneton , @xmath76 are partial electron densities in the spin subbands .",
    "the total electron density @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath27 and @xmath37 because of local neutrality conditions in metal .",
    "the magnetization flux density @xmath61 in eq .   also can be related with partial electric current densities in each subbands , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the relation has the following form : @xmath80 the total current density @xmath81 does not depend on @xmath27 too , because of one - dimensional geometry of our model .",
    "we use standard diffusion  drift formula for partial currents : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are partial mobilities , @xmath84 are partial diffusion coefficients and @xmath85 is an electric field strength inside the layer .",
    "now , we should substitute formula   in eq .   and express @xmath61 via @xmath86 , using eq .  .",
    "the calculations are direct and were done completely in ref .  .",
    "the result may be written as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath88 may be understood as an equilibrium conductivity spin polarization parameter with @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the effective spin diffusion constant . to obtain eq .",
    ", an additional assumption should be made ,  @xcite namely @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a characteristic current density in the layer * 2*. with typical parameter values , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , we get @xmath96 .",
    "the condition means the current disturbs the subband populations rather slightly , so that only a low injection level is realized . as it was mentioned above",
    ", we are interesting in currents @xmath97@xmath98 , which have an order of instability thresholds .",
    "therefore , the condition   should be well satisfied in our calculations .    after substituting expression   into eq .",
    "we obtain finally the following equation for @xmath99 : @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "since the _ sd _ exchange gap is fixed in our model , @xmath102 value does not depend on @xmath27 and @xmath37 .",
    "the spin diffusion length is @xmath103 .",
    "as it was mentioned at the beginning of this section , our above presented derivation may be referred to any junction layer .",
    "therefore , eq",
    ".   is valid to describe any definite layer if we perform the replacements : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and so on .",
    "moreover , we should take @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 for nonmagnetic layer * 3 * ( see ref .   for more details ) .    to solve eq .",
    ", we should derive the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we accept two sorts of the conditions : 1 ) the continuity condition of the mobile electron longitudinal spin fluxes , penetrating through the interfaces and 2 ) the continuity condition for difference between the chemical potentials of electrons in the spin subbands .",
    "it means the following equalities are to be valid for current flowing in forward direction ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath112 and @xmath113 , as well the following equalities are to be valid for backward direction of current ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "it may be written in an explicit form using the definition : @xmath116 for @xmath26 and @xmath117 for @xmath29 .",
    "the continuity condition for chemical potential differences was considered before us but , apparently , only for collinear orientations of magnetizations on the two opposite sides of the boundary ( spacer  @xcite or domain wall  @xcite ) .",
    "we have written the condition for oblique magnetization orientations in ref .  .",
    "now , we should return to the situation of oblique magnetizations because : 1 ) the idealization of pinned mobile electrons is removed and 2 ) vectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 may appear noncollinear .",
    "after calculations analogous to ref .  , we obtain @xmath120 + for @xmath26 and @xmath121 for @xmath29 . here",
    "the following definitions are introduced : @xmath122 $ ] , the quantities @xmath123 are densities of states for spin up and spin down electrons , @xmath124 is equilibrium chemical potential , which is constant across each junction layer .",
    "the equation   may be directly solved with the following result : @xmath125 where four constants @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 should be found from the boundary conditions  . moreover , we take @xmath130 , @xmath131 far from the interfaces , that is for @xmath132 . then we obtain the distribution of mobile electron magnetization across the junction considered . after some direct calculations ,",
    "we obtain the following results for the forward current @xmath26 :    @xmath133\\left(\\cosh\\lambda+\\nu_2\\sinh\\lambda\\right)\\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\sinh\\lambda+\\nu_2\\cosh\\lambda+ \\frac{1}{\\nu_1}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_1\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\lambda_f)\\right)^2\\left(\\cosh\\lambda + \\nu_2\\sinh\\lambda\\right)\\right]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath134,\\ ] ]    @xmath135    here we introduce dimensionless thickness @xmath136 and matching parameters for different interfaces @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "matching parameters are , in essence , the ratios of corresponding spin contact resistances .",
    "for small parameters ( @xmath139 ) spin flux penetrates slowly through the corresponding interface , that is the injection weakens greatly .",
    "similar situation is typical for metal  semiconductor boundary ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "opposite case of large enough parameter ( @xmath140 ) corresponds to ready flux penetration through the interface , and the moderate penetration corresponds to @xmath141 .",
    "as it is seen clearly from formulae   , the current disturbs spin equilibrium deeply inside the junction layers at distances of the order of diffusion lengths @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the nonequilibrium spin injection by current is indeed a bulk effect .",
    "moreover , the spin injection depends on the angle between the vectors @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "it shows explicitly the mobile electron magnetization does depend on the lattice magnetization vector @xmath145 direction . in principal ,",
    "such dependence arises because the mobile electrons represent much more rapid system than the magnetic lattice .",
    "therefore the electrons `` see '' at any time the instantaneous lattice configuration and are adapted to it .",
    "formally , it is seen from our transformation   of the basic equation   for electrons .",
    "the transformation is based on the condition  .",
    "the latter condition allows neglecting any inertia in the electron following the lattice .",
    "note finally according to boundary conditions   , we may simply make a replacement @xmath146 to go from the forward to backward current direction .",
    "therefore , formulae   and   remain valid for backward current ( @xmath29 ) after the replacement   is done .",
    "we should calculate variational derivative   to find the field @xmath147 .",
    "first , we calculate the _ sd _ exchange energy substituting formulae   into expression   and performing the integration over coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "then , we obtain for the forward current ( @xmath26 )    @xmath148^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\    & & \\times\\biggl\\{\\frac{q_2}{q_1}\\left[\\sinh\\lambda+\\frac{1}{\\nu_1}(\\cosh\\lambda-1 )    \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_1\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\lambda_f)\\right)^2\\right]+\\left[\\sinh\\lambda    + \\nu_2(\\cosh\\lambda-1)\\right]\\left[\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_1\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\lambda_f)\\right )    -\\frac{q_2}{q_1}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\frac{b}{\\nu_1}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_1\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\lambda_f)\\right )    \\left[\\frac{q_2}{q_1}+\\left[\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_1\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\lambda_f)\\right )    -\\frac{q_2}{q_1}\\right](\\cosh\\lambda+\\nu_2\\sinh\\lambda)\\right]\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath149 is an equilibrium part of the energy , which depends only on modulus @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "parameter @xmath152 describes the contribution of the layer * 1 * into the energy  .",
    "note , that the exchange energy for backward current ( @xmath29 ) may be easily got from expression   by means of the replacement  .    after differentiating   in accordance with  ,",
    "the equilibrium part of the effective field is collinear with @xmath35 and does not contribute to llg equation  .",
    "nonequilibrium part of the field may be written as @xmath153 where explicit expressions for the field @xmath154 depend on results of differentiation of the energy being different for forward and backward currents .",

    "it means the field vanishes everywhere except the sb layer near the interface @xmath23 taken from the side of the layer * 2*. therefore the magnitude of the effective field is a bulk quantity depending on such bulk parameters as @xmath161 . but this field is applied near to interface only , namely , to the point @xmath162 .",
    "this feature has a significant consequence .",
    "the action of the field may be described by two equivalent ways .",
    "one of them is to consider field   as a singular term in the bulk equations of motion llg for the lattice magnetization .",
    "exactly such a way was chosen in our previous preprint  @xcite and article .  @xcite but much more simple way is to include the field into the boundary condition for the lattice magnetization at the boundary point @xmath162 .",
    "this last way was proposed in ref .",
    "and we develop it here in the next section .",
    "we suggest a model , which is opposite to the model of uniformly spread spin transfer torque in the layer * 2*. in our model , the spin transfer torque is localized inside the sb layer @xmath30 and may be described as a boundary condition .",
    "such a model corresponds to the real situation if only the thickness of sb layer @xmath12 occurs the smallest length among the other lengths in the system ( i.e. , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 ) .    the total magnetization flux in the layers * 1 * and * 3 * consists only of mobile electron fluxes because magnetic lattice in the layer * 1 * is pinned , while the lattice in the layer * 3 * is nonmagnetic one .",
    "therefore , fluxes in these layers may be described by means of expressions of the type  .",
    "the situation with the layer * 2 * occurs significantly more complicated : mobile electrons and lattice both contribute to the flux .",
    "mobile electrons contribute to longitudinal part of the flux , which coincides with eq .",
    ", while the lattice creates a transverse part of the flux .    to derive all the spin fluxes , which may flow in our junction , it is convenient to return to initial equations   and  , sum them and rewrite in the form @xmath166+\\gamma\\left[\\mathbf",

    "the summation of the initial eqs .   and   is necessary to do in our case because the mobile electron flux may transfer to the lattice one and these fluxes together determine dynamics of the system .",
    "the second summand in the left hand side of eq .   may be rewritten as follows : @xmath168    = a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[\\hat{\\mathbf m},\\,\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf m}{\\partial x}\\right ]    \\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{j}_m}{\\partial x},\\ ] ] where @xmath169\\ ] ] may be considered as a lattice magnetization flux with parameter @xmath170 having the sense of a lattice magnetization diffusion constant ( see refs .   for more details ) .",
    "the next ( third ) summand in eq .   may be transformed using formula   for @xmath47 to the following form : @xmath171=\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{j}_{sd}}{\\partial    x},\\ ] ] where @xmath172\\theta(x-\\lambda_f)\\ ] ] represents a very interesting new quantity that may be called as an `` effective field transverse flux '' and @xmath173 is a well known step function : @xmath174 for @xmath175 and @xmath176 for @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , two lattice magnetization fluxes exist : and  , the last appearing due to _ sd _ effective field .",
    "all the lattice fluxes are perpendicular to the vector @xmath119 .",
    "the fourth summand in eq .   originates from mobile electron spin flux @xmath61 , which is given by eq .  . as it is seen , the flux @xmath61 is directed along vector @xmath35",
    "let us introduce the integration over the near - interface regions @xmath178 and @xmath179 with infinitesimal parameter @xmath180 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] for illustration ) : @xmath181 and apply these operations to eq .  .",
    "we should now introduce the conditions , which say explicitly that our nonmagnetic spacer layer appears nontransparent for the lattice magnetization excitations and fluxes .",
    "these conditions may be written as @xmath182 the latter condition being satisfied automatically because of the definition  .",
    "moreover , we accept the condition that our spacer is completely transparent for mobile electron spin flux that is no spin scattering processes occurs inside .",
    "this last condition may be written as @xmath183        after the operations   are applied , a number of simplifications become possible .",
    "in particular , two last summands in the left hand side of eq .   may be considered as a very small in comparison with the first summand ( since @xmath184 ) .",
    "these relaxation summands should be omitted if we want the flux continuity equations may be valid approximately .",
    "further , there exist a number of `` volume '' summands , which are proportional to the small length @xmath12 .",
    "it is desirable these summands to be sufficiently small too , namely , @xmath185+\\gamma\\alpha[\\mathbf",

    "formally , conditions   and   are satisfied well in the limit @xmath187 .",
    "then , we apply   to   using eqs .  , and making all the simplifications .",
    "we obtain as a result @xmath188 @xmath189 we put @xmath190 in eq .   because of",

    "the condition of instability that follows from   may be written in the form @xmath370    as it is seen , forward current ( @xmath371 ) leads to instability of * ap * states only ( because of to satisfy   we should take @xmath372 ) and , vise versa , backward current ( @xmath373 ) leads to instability of * p * states ( we should take @xmath374 ) .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with our localized torque theory ( see section  [ section10 ] of this paper ) .",
    "numerical estimation gives @xmath375 .",
    "however , we should stress here the correct understanding of the problem can not be possible without including both the mechanisms ( tst and lsi ) acting simultaneously .",
    "first , the lsi was included implicitly in the condition   for backward current switching . really , the existence of _ sd _ exchange effective field @xmath376 ( see eq .  ) is necessary to understand the backward transverse spin flux appearing in the layer * 2 * and transformation of this flux into the lattice flux .",
    "the relation   describes such a transformation and allows calculate the tst parameter @xmath213  .",
    "moreover , the results of the paper show the lsi mechanism manifests itself significantly and in different ways .",
    "for example , the instability threshold does not rise with increasing the gilbert damping constant @xmath1 but reaches some limiting value due to lsi mechanism ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "increment of instability may be more than order of magnitude larger due to lsi ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "interplay of tst and lsi mechanisms makes it possible to provide the instability simultaneously of * p * and * ap * states ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it means , no switching but rather new time dependent final nonlinear state may appear as a result of the instability development .",
