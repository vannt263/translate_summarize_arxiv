    "the fact that quantum systems can exhibit correlations that have no classical analog is at the core of quantum theory . in the last decades",
    "it has been realized that these quantum correlations are not only of fundamental interest ; they can moreover be manipulated to achieve tasks that are impossible with classical devices .",
    "these applications include quantum communication , quantum computation and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "hence , a lot of effort has been devoted to reach a better understanding of quantum correlations and to find new ways to detect , quantify and manipulate them .",
    "while the theory of bipartite quantum correlations is well developed , the multipartite case still holds many open problems @xcite .",
    "the drastic difference between the bipartite and multipartite case is particularly clear in the case of quantum entanglement , which is fundamental to many applications in quantum information theory . for bipartite quantum systems there exists ( up to local unitary operations )",
    "one single most entangled state , the maximally entangled state .",
    "its name is justified by the fact that spatially separated parties can deterministically obtain any other bipartite state from the maximally entangled state by manipulating it via local operations assisted by classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "the maximally entangled state is hence the optimal bipartite entanglement resource .",
    "it maximizes any measure of entanglement and serves as a standard with which the resourcefulness of other entangled bipartite quantum states can be compared .",
    "this situation changes drastically if one enters the multipartite realm .",
    "multipartite quantum systems can be entangled in many inequivalent ways @xcite and generally there does not exist a unique maximally entangled state that can serve as a standard to assess the resourcefulness of other quantum states @xcite . in the last years , several classes of multipartite entangled quantum states with interesting properties have been identified and some of these have motivated novel multipartite applications , such as one - way quantum computing @xcite , secret sharing @xcite or applications in quantum metrology @xcite . but the correlations these states contain are nevertheless often only partially understood . a better understanding of their properties seems however crucial if one wants to find new truly multipartite applications of the quantum correlations they exhibit .    to this end , different approaches are being pursued .",
    "one approach is to qualify and quantify quantum correlations in terms of their transformation properties .",
    "as entanglement is a resource under locc , it is natural to study locc transformations of multipartite quantum states @xcite .",
    "moreover , more general transformations have been considered , such as separable transformations @xcite or @xmath0-nonentangling operations @xcite , despite the fact that they lack a clear physical meaning .",
    "another approach is to find measures to quantify the quantum correlations contained in multipartite states .",
    "these include approaches based on , e.g. quantum entropic quantities , concurrences and polynomial invariants @xcite .    in recent work @xcite",
    ", the concept of complementarity , another distinctive feature of quantum theory , has been used to quantify quantum correlations of bipartite quantum systems . in the present work ,",
    "we generalize these results to the multipartite setting .",
    "two observables are called complementary if certainty about the measurement outcome of one observable implies complete uncertainty about the outcome of the other observable . for complementary observables",
    "the absolute value of the overlap between any eigenstate of the first observable with any eigenstate of the second observable is constant @xcite and their eigenbases are called mutually unbiased .",
    "mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) have many applications ranging from quantum state tomography , quantum error correction , and quantum cryptography to the detection of entanglement @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use the notion of complementary observables to study quantum correlations .",
    "the central idea is that only quantum correlated states can exhibit strong classical correlations in the measurement outcomes of local complementary observables .",
    "we use mutually unbiased bases to define a novel set of measures of quantum correlations , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 has a clear operational meaning as it measures multipartite quantum correlations in terms of the maximal classical mutual information that a single party can share with the other parties by measuring the state in @xmath3 mutually unbiased bases .",
    "this generalizes the bipartite measure of `` complementary correlations '' introduced in @xcite to the multipartite case .",
    "we investigate which states are maximally correlated with respect to @xmath2 and present some necessary and some sufficient conditions for this to be the case , thereby providing new physical insight into the quantum correlations they contain .",
    "moreover , we present several other applications of @xmath2 for pure and mixed quantum states .",
    "one application is entanglement detection .",
    "while the effort required to certify entanglement generally increases rapidly with the system size @xcite , we show how @xmath2 can be used to detect even high - dimensional genuine tripartite entanglement employing only a few local measurement settings .",

    "moreover , for a state @xmath16 of a composite system of @xmath17 subsystems we measure the mutual dependence of the outcomes of measurements on different sets of subsystems via their mutual information .",

    "the mutual information between the measurement outcomes in @xmath24 and @xmath25 is then @xmath26 here , we used the conditional entropy of the outcomes obtained at @xmath24 conditioned on the outcomes of @xmath25 , @xmath27 note here that @xmath22 and @xmath28 are allowed to be different for @xmath29 .",
    "if the global system is partitioned into one subsystem , @xmath30 , and the rest , @xmath31 , we often use the notation @xmath32 for the sake of readability and analogous abbreviations for other quantities .",
    "that is , @xmath32 denotes the mutual information between subsystem @xmath30 and the rest when the bases @xmath33 are measured .",
    "let us denote the dimensions of the subsystems @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",

    "the bound is reached iff the outcomes of the measurements by one subset of parties @xmath35 with @xmath37 are completely uncertain , but as soon as the measurement results of the other subsystems are known , one can predict them with certainty .",
    "let us now review some definitions and results concerning mutually unbiased bases ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",

    "the eigenvectors of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , fulfill @xmath59 .",
    "notice also that the eigenbasis of @xmath60 is the computational basis and the mutually unbiased fourier basis is the eigenbasis of @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the eigenbases of @xmath64 constitute a set of two mubs for any @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that the method of entanglement detection via mubs proposed in @xcite can be generalized for bipartite systems to mums and that this increases the detection strength if no complete set of mubs is known @xcite .",
    "as we show here , the results derived in the previous sections can be generalized to the case where mums are measured on the subsystems instead of mubs .",
    "two generalized measurements in @xmath8 , @xmath375 and @xmath376 , are called mutually unbiased if @xcite @xmath377 for all @xmath378 and for all @xmath379 , where @xmath380 and @xmath381 holds iff all povm elements are rank one projectors and the mums are therefore also mubs .",
    "a set of @xmath49 generalized measurements that are mutually unbiased with the same @xmath382 is called a complete set of mums .",
    "in @xcite it has also been shown how a complete set of mums can be constructed for any @xmath38 from any orthogonal basis of the space of hermitian , traceless operators that map @xmath8 to itself .",
    "due to the operational character of @xmath2 , its generalization to mums is obvious . instead of measuring the classical correlations obtained by measuring in mubs ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : c1]-[eq : c2 ] ) for the definition of @xmath2 ) , we use the same entropic quantities to quantify the classical correlations obtained by measuring in mums .",
    "the thresholds for entanglement detection in lemma [ lem : fsep ] and lemma [ lem : bisep ] can also be easily generalized to mums . in order to see this , note first that a complete set of mums @xmath383 fulfills the uncertainty relation @xcite @xmath384 the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : entmum ] ) appears to be stronger for smaller @xmath382 .",
    "however , the uncertainty of each measurement itself has to be included in any judgement about the mutual unbiasedness of the mums .",
    "this can be easily seen by looking at a measurement with the minimum value of @xmath385 , whose measurement operators are completely mixed and therefore do not yield any information about the state of the system . in @xcite it has been shown how one can account for this uncertainty inherent to non - projective measurements in order to get improved uncertainty relations .",
    "( [ eq : entmum ] ) one can , similar to lemma [ lem : fsep ] for mubs , show that a state @xmath16 that is measured in a set of mums with efficiency parameter @xmath382 that yields the correlations @xmath386 is entangled if @xmath387 and genuinely tripartite entangled if @xmath388 in future research it would be interesting to investigate whether mums can increase the detection efficiency of the presented method for some systems .",
    "we have presented a set of new measures of multipartite quantum correlations , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 measures multipartite quantum correlations in terms of classical correlations contained in the measurement results of local measurements in @xmath3 mutually unbiased bases .",
    "this generalizes the approach presented in @xcite to the multipartite realm .",
    "we have derived some necessary and some sufficient conditions for a multipartite state to maximize @xmath2 .",
    "these allowed us to show that many interesting multipartite quantum states maximize these measures .",
    "examples are states that have been identified as being particularily important in the context of locc transformations in earlier works ; other examples are certain graph states and generalized ghz states .",
    "we have moreover shown that the set of correlations @xmath1 can be used to detect genuine tripartite entanglement using only a few local measurement settings in mutually unbiased bases .",
    "this allows to detect even high - dimensional tripartite entanglement using only two local measurement settings whose phase relation does not need to be known .    as @xmath2 is a correlation measure with a clear operational meaning , it would be interesting to see in future research if it can reveal new applications for states that maximize @xmath2",
    ". moreover , it would be interesting to study the generalization of @xmath2 to mums in more detail and investigate whether this leads to an increased efficiency in entanglement detection . finally , it would be appealing to investigate how the correlation measures @xmath1 could be used to detect genuine multipartite entanglement of systems comprised of more than three subsystems .",
