    "in the standard model , the charged leptons are identical in all respects except for their masses and their distinct and conserved lepton numbers .",
    "there is , however , no experimentally verified explanation for why there are three generations of leptons nor why their masses are so different .",
    "new insight might be forthcoming if the leptons were observed to have substructure , which could be manifest as an anomalous magnetic or electric dipole moment .",
    "the anomalous moments for the electron and muon are already measured to be in extremely good agreement with the predictions of qed@xcite .",
    "anomalous moments of the tau are relatively poorly measured and are of particular interest since , as the heaviest lepton , the tau may exhibit the most sensitivity to new physics .    in general a photon may couple to a tau through its electric charge , magnetic dipole moment , or electric dipole moment ( neglecting possible anapole moments ) .",
    "we may parametrise this coupling with the following matrix element : @xmath2 @xmath3 represents the most general lorentz - invariant form of the coupling of a tau to a photon : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the @xmath6 lepton , and @xmath7 is the momentum transfer . as can be verified using the gordon decomposition , the @xmath8-dependent form - factors , @xmath9 , have familiar interpretations for @xmath10 and with the @xmath6 on mass - shell : @xmath11 is the electric charge of the tau , @xmath12 is the static anomalous magnetic moment of the tau ( where @xmath13 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) , and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the static electric dipole moment of the tau and @xmath16 is its charge .",

    "several limits on @xmath24 and @xmath25 at various values of @xmath8 have been reported @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of these form factors depends strongly on the hypothetical mechanism giving rise to anomalous values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is commonly assumed that @xmath28 corresponds to the static anomalous magnetic moment and @xmath29 the static electric dipole moment , since the radiated photon has zero @xmath8 .",
    "this condition is necessary but not sufficient ; the tau must also be on - shell on both sides of the @xmath1 vertex which is only valid in the limit of vanishing photon energy .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the precession measurements of electrons and muons  @xcite .",
    "none of the measurements of tau anomalous moments published thus far satisfies both of these conditions , so we urge caution in the interpretation of the limits obtained on the form factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of the static tau properties , @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",

    "the corresponding matrix element is then evaluated using the symbolic manipulation package form  @xcite without making any simplifying assumptions . in particular , no interference terms are neglected and no fermion masses are assumed to be zero . the inclusion of a non - zero tau mass is essential , as the ( significant ) interference terms between the standard model and the anomalous amplitudes vanish in the limit of vanishing tau mass .",

    "infrared divergences for collinear or low energy photons may be naturally avoided by applying cuts on minimum photon energy and/or opening angle between the photon and tau .",
    "this method eliminates potential concerns about the consistency of cancelling divergences against vertex corrections which are calculated in qed assuming that the anomalous couplings vanish .",
    "moreover , this procedure matches well the experimental reality , since electromagnetic calorimeters have a minimum energy cutoff and isolation cuts are required to distinguish tau decay products from radiated photons .",
    "it is illustrative to isolate the anomalous contribution to the cross section from the purely standard model contribution .",
    "the anomalous contribution is given by those terms in the matrix element which contain a factor of @xmath28 or @xmath29 : @xmath35 terms linear in @xmath28 and @xmath29 arise from interference between standard model and anomalous amplitudes , whereas the quadratic terms are purely anomalous .",

    "evidently the interference does vanish in the case of an electric dipole moment .",
    "in addition to affecting the total cross section , anomalous couplings also affect the shapes of energy and angular distributions of the final state particles . because of their experimental accessibility , we choose to study the photon energy , the three - dimensional opening angle between the photon and the closest tau , and the photon polar angle with respect to the electron direction . figure  [ fig : e_a_t]a shows the anomalous contribution to the photon energy spectrum for various values used in plots in this paper were chosen to be in the neighborhood of the expected lep sensitivity to @xmath28 .",

    "as a technical crosscheck , we create a sample of events weighted using our matrix element calculation , henceforth referred to as `` ttg , '' with @xmath41 and compare the total cross section and energy and angular distributions with the predictions of the koralz  @xcite monte carlo .",
    "since ttg provides an @xmath42 calculation , koralz is also used in a mode in which only single photon radiation is considered . in order to prevent infrared divergences in ttg",
    ", cuts are placed on the photon energy and opening angles , as discussed in section  [ sec : calculation ] . in particular",
    ", we require the photon energy to be greater than 1  gev , the cosine of the opening angle between the photon and the nearest @xmath6 to be less than 0.995 , and the cosine of the polar angle of the photon with respect to the electron direction to be less than 0.9 .",
    "the total cross sections calculated by koralz and ttg for these cuts agree to better than @xmath43 .",

    "an analytical calculation for the process @xmath0 was carried out  @xcite .",
    "this calculation makes some approximations , but importantly does not assume zero tau mass and does not neglect interference between standard model and anomalous final states . as a mutual cross check , we compare our results with the total cross section and photon energy spectrum predicted by this calculation .",
    "the analytical calculation neglects anomalous contributions from initial - final state interference , from @xmath44 interference , and from @xmath45 exchange , so for purposes of comparison we remove these terms from our calculations as well .",
    "figure  [ fig : ttg_vs_riemann_e ] shows    a comparison of anomalous cross sections as a function of @xmath28 as determined by our simplified version of ttg and the analytical calculation , indicating agreement at the 1% level . figure  [ fig : ttg_vs_riemann_e2 ] gives a comparison of the photon energy spectra for the two calculations , showing good agreement between the spectrum shapes over a large range of @xmath28 and the full range of photon energies accessible near the z resonance .    at this point",
    ", one may ask whether all the possible anomalous contributions are important , or whether one need only consider the simplified case just discussed . to check this",
    ", we use our calculation to determine the full anomalous contribution to the cross section , including all the terms neglected in the analytical calculation , and compare with the simplified result .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_vs_simple ] shows the difference between the cross sections as a function of @xmath28 for the two cases .",
    "the discrepancy is roughly 1% of the total anomalous cross section , showing that one can safely neglect anomalous contributions from initial - final state interference , @xmath44 interference , and @xmath45 exchange .",
    "previous experimental limits on @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite have assumed that the interference between the standard model and anomalous contributions to the cross section can be neglected . as we have shown in figure  [ fig : x_edm_mdm ] , this is not generally true for the anomalous magnetic dipole moment .",
    "if we take @xmath46 , for example , then failure to account for interference leads to an underestimate of the anomalous contribution to the total cross section by about 25% if @xmath28 is positive , and an overestimate of almost 50% if @xmath28 is negative .",
    "these discrepancies become even more pronounced for smaller @xmath47 .",
    "we have shown that the photon energy , the opening angle between the photon and the nearest tau , and the photon polar angle each contains independent information about @xmath28 and @xmath29 , including the sign of @xmath28 ( figures  [ fig : e_a_t ] and  [ fig : e_vs_a ] ) .",
    "one should note , however , that the distributions presented in these figures include no cuts on photon energies or angles . in practice",
    ", detector geometry imposes a cut on the photon polar angle with respect to the electron direction , and further cuts must be applied on the photon energy and minimum opening angle between the photon and tau in order to suppress background from tau decay products . in particular ,",
    "the unavoidable cut on the opening angle must be placed in exactly the region where sensitivity to the sign of the anomalous coupling is highest .",
    "other theoretical treatments  @xcite have provided cross sections or differential distributions , which are generally not sufficient for meaningful analysis of the data .",
    "for example , we have just seen that the anomalous contribution to the cross section depends strongly on the various experimental cuts applied , an effect which is difficult if not impossible to assess without a full monte carlo simulation .",
    "the calculation described here provides just such a tool .",
    "it may be employed to yield samples of 4-vectors for the final state particles in @xmath0 , which can be passed to the tauola  @xcite program to perform the tau decays .",
    "the resulting final state particles can then be passed through the detector simulation program , which will account for such effects as energy loss and interactions in the detector , geometrical acceptance , and energy and spatial resolutions , together with obscure correlations which are not easily handled on a statistical basis .",
    "alternatively , the matrix element calculation may be used to compute event - by - event weights for a given value of @xmath28 or @xmath29 using 4-vectors from previously simulated @xmath0 events .",
    "this makes it possible to reweight existing samples for which detector effects have already been simulated , thus saving considerable computing time .    in order to estimate the sensitivity to anomalous moments expected for the lep experiments running at @xmath48",
    ", we have performed a study of simulated @xmath49 events as they would appear in the l3 detector  @xcite .",
    "the simulated sample corresponds to roughly the integrated luminosity collected by l3 at the z peak ( about 100  @xmath50 ) and an anomalous magnetic moment @xmath38 and electric dipole moment @xmath51 .",
    "we estimate @xmath52 efficiency for selecting @xmath49 events , which is dominated by the requirement that at least one jet be in the barrel region @xmath53 of the detector .",
    "events with good quality photons are selected and background from tau decay products is rejected by asking that the transverse energy of the photon to the nearest jet be larger than 2  gev .",
    "we then perform a binned maximum likelihood fit of the selected photon energy spectrum to an independent collection of simulated samples which have been weighted , using the method outlined above , such that they correspond to many different values of @xmath28 .",
    "the fit results show that if the true value of @xmath38 , one can expect to set a @xmath54 confidence level limit of roughly @xmath55 , the sensitivity improves . of course",
    ", the exact value of the limit will depend on the details of the experiment , selection applied , and the variables used in the fit .",
    "we have carried out a calculation of the squared matrix element for the process @xmath0 , allowing for possible anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments at the @xmath56 vertex .",
    "no interferences are neglected and no fermion masses are set to zero .",
    "the calculation shows that the total cross section as well as the shapes of the photon energy and angular distributions are sensitive to anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "we also find that interference between anomalous and standard model contributions is significant for the case of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment , and increases in importance for smaller values @xmath28 .",
    "the bulk of the contribution from terms linear in @xmath28 arises from interference between anomalous and standard model final states .",
