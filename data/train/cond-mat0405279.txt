    "adsorbate - induced changes in the substrate morphology is a quite common phenomenon in nature .",
    "this concerns with in - plane and out - of - plane surface modifications , such as reconstruction or roughening ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    for simple crystalline surfaces ( single crystals )",
    "there are well - developed hamiltonian models dealing theoretically with the adsorbate - induced restructuring effects@xcite .",
    "focusing on the roughness , the solid - on - solid models@xcite are appropriate for the description of the surface morphology under the influence of adsorption .",
    "nevertheless , even in this `` traditional '' domain there are certain unsolved problems with the surface structure determination@xcite .",
    "therefore , one has to work under conditions of incomplete information .",
    "moreover , many adsorbents do not fall into this class because of their intrinsic complexity .",
    "the latter appears as a consequence of the surface disorder , heterogeneity@xcite or polydispersity .",
    "glassy@xcite , granular , amorphous@xcite , or porous materials , like aerogels@xcite , could serve as examples .",
    "the morphology of such materials is conventionally specified by a probability distribution ( e.g. site energies , pore or grain sizes ) . in many cases",
    "the distribution itself is unknown . for randomly heterogeneous surfaces the information comes from scattering experiments or stm images . in the case of three - dimensional structures",
    "one has to rely upon results of indirect measurements ( such as nitrogen adsorption , mercury porosimetry , thermoporometry , etc ) .",
    "these techniques give a quite limited information from which the probability distribution should be determined .",
    "this problem is beyond the scope of the standard statistical mechanics , which starts from a microscopic model .    actually , the situation is complicated by the fact that the surface morphology@xcite and/or energetics@xcite change in the course of adsorption .",
    "this is quite common phenomenon , occurring , for instance , during the aerogel characterization@xcite or in the course of various insertion processes@xcite . in this respect",
    "the problem is essentially as follows .",
    "one has to describe the surface evolution from a poorly characterized initial ( e. g. clean surface ) to a final ( adsorbate - induced ) state .",
    "in addition , the adsorbate thermodynamics , coupled to the surface morphology , should be calculated .",
    "the inverse problem , that is , restoring the clean surface characteristics from its morphology in the covered state , is also important .    in this paper",
    "we make an attempt to deal with such problems combining the information theory approach@xcite and the standard statistical thermodynamics .",
    "the adsorbate - substrate system can be split into subsystems with different levels of description .",
    "one is a dynamic subsystem ( the adsorbate ) , which evolves according to a hamiltonian , containing unknown parameters ( local roughness of the surface ) .",
    "the surface is considered as a stochastic system .",
    "its morphology ( e.g. step configuration ) is specified by a probability distribution .",
    "this combined scheme looks quite similar to the so - called superstatistics@xcite , that describes the statistics in systems with fluctuating intensive quantities .",
    "the key difference is that in our case the probability distribution is unknown .",
    "it has to be inferred from a limited number of constraints .",
    "recently such a maximum - entropy procedure has been applied to a description of velocity fluctuations in turbulent fluids@xcite and the strain fluctuations in heterogeneous intercalation systems@xcite . in our case",
    "the adsorbate can influence the surface roughness and their coupling determines both the thermodynamic behavior and the shape of the probability distribution .",
    "it is essential that one necessarily deals with two entropic impacts@xcite : the thermodynamic entropy ( due to the adsorbate ) and the information entropy ( due to the probability distribution ) . constructing from these two terms a suitable entropy measure",
    ", we investigate the evolution of the surface morphology and the adsorbate thermodynamics .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to find a relation between the surface structure and the adsorbate thermodynamic response to these structural modifications .",
    "this would allow one to gain an information on the surface following the adsorbate behavior .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how the maximum entropy formalism can be applied to inferring a distribution based on a limited information . for concreteness we consider a solid - like semi - infinite substrate ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the surface ( substrate ) morphology is represented by a collection of steps @xmath0 growing on discrete sites @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , describing a deviation from the flat geometry .",
    "a sketch of the surface profile is given in figure  1 .",
    "it is assumed that , because of its complex nature , the surface can not be described deterministically , i.e. in terms of a hamiltonian governing the substrate evolution .",
    "thus we have to accept a probabilistic description , focusing on a distribution @xmath3 of the step configurations .",
    "however , the distribution is unknown .",
    "the only available information concerns with a set of experimental tests determining@xcite , for instance , the average roughness @xmath4    for simplicity the steps are taken as spatially non - correlated @xmath5 . then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of steps . therefore , @xmath8 is a probability to find a step of magnitude @xmath9 at a randomly chosen surface site @xmath10 .",
    "having such a restricted information on the substrate , one can infer its statistics within the information theory approach @xcite .",
    "the inference procedure is based on a given entropy measure @xmath11 , which is taken here in the shannon form @xmath12 this entropy is a measure of our uncertainty on the system , in the sense that @xmath11 increases with broadening @xmath8 .",
    "the least biased normalized distribution , compatible with the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) is obtained by extremizing the lagrangian @xmath13 -\\\\\\nonumber \\lambda_0\\left[\\sum_k\\int dh_k p(h_k)h_k^2-h_0 \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this leads to a gaussian distribution @xmath14 the lagrange multiplier @xmath15 can be determined from the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) @xmath16 .",
    "we do not discuss here how precise is this description .",
    "having more information , e.g. @xmath17 , we can follow the same scheme in order to obtain a refined distribution .",
    "being exposed to a fluid , the surface can adsorb the fluid particles on the sites ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "having information@xcite on the roughness @xmath18 in the presence of adsorption , one can infer the step distribution maximizing @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , the distribution is also gaussian @xmath19 but with a different width @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath18 is close to @xmath21 , then one would conclude that @xmath22 and the adsorbate - induced effects are negligible",
    ". this can be the case if the surface is quenched .",
    "as is discussed above , the surface may change its morphology even if the average roughness remains unchanged .",
    "in other words , we do not have new _ a priori _ information if @xmath23 . then , starting with the same entropy measure @xmath11 , we arrive at a trivial ( but misleading ) result : @xmath22 .",
    "this defect can be avoided in ( at least ) two ways .",
    "one might need to compare higher moments ( for instance , the average of @xmath24 ) .",
    "this would require additional tests@xcite .",
    "alternatively , we may refine the entropy measure , taking into account the adsorbate - induced effects .",
    "this requires to make a link between the surface structure and the adsorbate properties .",
    "the adsorbate is considered as a dynamic subsystem , whose coupling to the surface is given by a hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the surface evolves in time much slower than the adsorbate , that reaches the equilibrium while the surface is practically unchanged .",
    "tracing over the set of occupation numbers @xmath26 at a given step configuration we can calculate the partition function @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath29 is a thermodynamic variable ( e. g. , chemical potential or coverage , see below )",
    ". then the adsorbate thermodynamics , for instance , the conditional entropy @xmath30 , can also be calculated .    in what follows",
    "this quantity will play an essential role .",
    "therefore , it is important to clarify its meaning . as a function of @xmath29",
    "the entropy is the conventional thermodynamic state function .",
    "it is a measure of the adsorbate disorder for a given surface structure @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath29 is fixed ( e. g. fixed adsorbate pressure ) , then @xmath32 as a function of @xmath31 should be considered as an effective potential , selecting a preferable step configuration ",
    "the one which maximizes @xmath32 .",
    "since we are dealing with adsorbate - induced effects , then @xmath30 should be relevant to the surface structure evolution .",
    "therefore we refine the entropy measure @xmath33 which takes into account the fact that some part of our uncertainty on the surface state is due to the adsorbate thermodynamic state @xmath30 . in what follows",
    "we assume that the steps do not correlate through the adsorbate @xmath34 .",
    "imlicitly this means a restriction on the hamiltonian @xmath35 ( see below ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is a measure of the adsorbate influence on the step distribution . in other words",
    ", @xmath36 is a degree of the surface quenching , such that @xmath37 as @xmath38 and we return to the clean surface problem .",
    "determination of @xmath36 is a separate problem that might require additional tests .",
    "for instance , comparing the surface step creation energy @xmath39 and the adsorbate binding energy excess @xmath40 , we may estimate @xmath41 .",
    "however , in this study @xmath36 is taken as a parameter .    therefore , we consider the lagrangian @xmath42 that must be extremized .",
    "this procedure leads to @xmath43 the multiplier @xmath44 should be determined from the constraint on the roughness @xmath18 .",
    "the term @xmath45 partially keeps traces of the surface preparation ( a given roughness @xmath18 ) .",
    "the second term @xmath46 corresponds to the adsorbate - induced effects .",
    "if @xmath32 is an analytic function , then we may expand@xcite @xmath47 therefore , even without resorting to any specific model , it is clear that @xmath48 is potentially more informative than @xmath49 as the former contains higher order terms ( in @xmath50 ) .",
    "as is noted above , in order to obtain a similar result staring from @xmath11 , one needs additional information .",
    "therefore , refining the entropy measure , we restore ( at least partially ) this information .",
    "in particular , we can calculate a global change of the surface structure in comparison to the clean surface case .",
    "this can be done using the symmetric kullback - leibler information measure @xmath51 \\ln \\left [ \\frac{p_{\\kappa}(h_i)}{p_0(h_i ) } \\right]\\ ] ] which tells us how much these two distributions are different .",
    "@xmath52 is found to be @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angular brackets @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the averages taken with the distributions @xmath56 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "therefore , even if @xmath23 , the global variation of the surface structure , induced by adsorption is proportional to the change of the adsorbate thermodynamic state .",
    "the state @xmath54 does not necessarily correspond to the clean surface , it could be any suitable reference state . in the same way one can estimate the information gain due to the refinement of the distribution ( replacement @xmath49 by @xmath48 ) .",
    "this result is quite general , it does not depend on the microscopic details underlying @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , in order to study the distribution itself we need to consider a microscopic model .",
    "in order to demonstrate what kind of local changes are induced by adsorption , as an illustration we choose one of the simplest adsorption models  the non - interacting lattice gas with a height - dependent binding energy @xcite ) @xmath58 we are aware that the model itself is quite `` rough '' in application to real adsorbates .",
    "it neglects the lateral interactions and , therefore , is inadequate for the description of the adsorbate critical behavior ( such as liquid - gas or order - disorder transitions ) . nevertheless above the critical temperature",
    "this model is qualitatively correct .",
    "in addition it is exactly solvable such that one can be sure that our implementations are not artifacts of approximations ( e.g. mean field ) .",
    "moreover , we do not take into account that the roughness increases the surface area , allowing for more than a monolayer coverage@xcite .",
    "thus @xmath59 or @xmath60 independently of @xmath50 .",
    "the entropy of this simplified model is given by ( the role of @xmath29 is played by the chemical potential @xmath61 ) @xmath62-[1-\\theta(h_i)]\\ln[1-\\theta(h_i)]\\ ] ] here the coverage is langmuirian @xmath63 the adsorbate activity @xmath64 is related to the chemical potential @xmath61 via @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the height - dependent adsorbate binding energy . @xmath67 a step can be viewed as a loosely coordinated site with the binding energy larger@xcite than that for the flat surface . here",
    "@xmath40 is the binding energy excess due to the local deviation from the flat geometry .",
    "the binding to the flat surface @xmath68 is an irrelevant constant that can be absorbed into the definition of @xmath64 .    in figure",
    "2 @xmath69 is analyzed as a function of @xmath50 and dimensionless activity @xmath70 .",
    "the entropy ( as a function of @xmath71 ) behaves in the usual way , exhibiting a single maximum at some @xmath72 which depends on the magnitude of @xmath50 and @xmath40 . at relatively high adsorbate activities",
    "( @xmath73 ) @xmath69 is also single - peaked as a function of @xmath50 , with the maximum located at @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests a tendency towards random deviations from @xmath74 .",
    "this maximum transforms into a minimum when the activity changes its sign ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "then the entropy develops two symmetric peaks at some @xmath76 that depends on the magnitude of @xmath71 and @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the position @xmath74 becomes unfavorable and the surface would tend to exhibit a random zig - zagging with the steps distributed near @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , considering @xmath69 as an effective potential for the step variables @xmath50 , one expects qualitative changes in the surface morphology with changing adsorbate activity @xmath71 . in order to analyze ( qualitatively ) what this implies for the distribution @xmath48 , we take @xmath44 as a parameter and set the normalization constant ( the denominator in ( [ pnew ] ) ) equal @xmath60",
    ". then we can not calculate averages , but these simplifications do not change the shape of the distribution .",
    "such a reduced @xmath78 is plotted schematically in figure  3 .",
    "it is seen that with increasing @xmath36 the distribution changes from a gaussian ( @xmath79 ) to a tri - modal .",
    "this results from an interplay between the adsorbate - induced effects and the tendency to keep a given roughness .",
    "the curves coincide in the large-@xmath9 region because the distribution is not normalized . for quantitative purposes",
    "this defect can be removed by numerical integration in eq .",
    "( [ pnew ] ) .",
    "it is clear ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that the adsorbed species occupy the space of the corrugated surface layer@xcite . therefore the adsorbate is confined to a non - planar slit , whose average thickness @xmath80 is determined by the surface roughness @xmath18 ( see figure  1 ) . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath50 gives a length scale , then the surface roughness @xmath18 ( the average of @xmath81 ) is at the same time the surface area excess in comparison to a flat surface .",
    "thus @xmath48 can be considered as a surface area distribution . within this analogy",
    "we make a qualitative comparison to monte carlo results@xcite for the surface area fraction in pores with rough walls ( see the insets in figure .  2 ) .",
    "the right inset exhibits a peaked ( nearly gaussian ) distribution that corresponds to an empty pore .",
    "the left inset depicts the adsorbate - induced surface structure .",
    "it is seen that our approach describes quite well this physics ( recall that @xmath36 is a measure of adsorbate - induced effects ) .",
    "we did not try to fit , because the models are not strictly identical .",
    "it is remarkable that our scheme is capable of inferring the surface structure even without entering the microscopic details concerning the surface .",
    "moreover the simulation results@xcite are not much sensitive to the type of adsorbate - wall interaction ( hydrophilic or hydrophobic , see fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the adsorbate - induced surface rearrangement is mainly an entropic effect .",
    "this is coherent with our implications .",
    "the evolution of coupled adsorbate - substrate system is investigated in terms of a new approach combining the information theory and the standard statistical mechanics .",
    "the approach is suitable for complex systems , where , for a number of reasons , not all the microscopic details ( e. g. a hamiltonian ) are available .",
    "the approach establishes a clear correlation between the substrate morphology ( e. g. roughness ) and the adsorbate thermodynamic state .",
    "this implies a statistical scheme for surface characterization in the course of the adsorbate - substrate coupling , and allows one to estimate the surface morphology based on the information concerning the adsorbate thermodynamic response .",
    "one can also predict the clean surface properties based on its morphology under adsorption and vice versa .",
    "thus , our scheme is , in some sense , complimentary to the recent ( mainly simulational ) surface characterization techniques @xcite .",
    "it can also be applied to analyzing the experimental data on porous adsorbents @xcite .",
    "we would like to underline that the simple model considered here serves just as an illustration . to be more realistic in further applications we have to consider the adsorbate - adsorbate interactions and a correlation between the steps .",
    "also , the experimentally available information ( @xmath21 or @xmath18 ) is supposed to be quite crude . in many cases of real surfaces",
    "a more detailed statistics can be extracted ( for instance , from stm images ) , for example,- pair correlation @xmath82 .",
    "nevertheless , for three - dimensional matrices ( like aerogels ) in the majority of cases only indirect measurements are available .",
    "all these features can be easily incorporated into our approach .",
    "apart from the practical applications , our approach seems promising in analyzing a class of coupled dynamic - stochastic systems , where the stochastic subsystem is not perfectly quenched .",
    "particularly interesting is to study the adsorbate critical behavior under conditions when a porous matrix responds to the adsorbate thermodynamics ( e.g. helium absorption in aerogels ) .",
