    "auroral intensification has been vigorously studied with narrow field of view or high resolution optical measurements [ e.g. , donovan et al .",
    ", 2007 ; mende et al . , 2009 ] .",
    "it is known that the time scale of intensification is 12 min , and fading of auroral arcs appears just before the onset .",
    "furthermore , vortex street structures called as `` beads '' emerged on the auroral arc , probably due to a development of strong flow shears .",
    "it has been considered that , on the basis of the above facts , shear alfv@xmath0n waves propagating along the magnetic field line are involved in auroral intensification .",
    "three - dimensional simulations that treated amplification of shear alfv@xmath0n waves , driven by a coupling between the ionospheric and magnetospheric plasmas with field - aligned currents , were performed [ jia and streltsov , 2014 ; hiraki , 2015a , b ] .",
    "hiraki [ 2015b ] presented that a threshold exists for the instability of alfv@xmath0n waves due to an enhancement of plasma convection ; the threshold electric field was @xmath1 mv / m in their situation .",
    "these studies did not explicitly treat the electron acceleration by field - aligned electric fields and the ionization of neutral atmosphere , which are the essence of discrete auroras .",
    "they assumed that the upward field - aligned current carried by waves is identical to the auroral luminosity .",
    "measurements of electron density by eiscat radar [ kirkwood et al . , 1990 ; olsson et al . , 1996 ] and of particles by dmsp and fast satellites [ yago et al . , 2005 ; mende et al . ,",
    "2003 ] revealed that the field - aligned electric field originates from inverted - v type potential drops at a height of @xmath2 km or inertial alfv@xmath0n waves excited at @xmath3 km .",
    "energies of electrons accelerated by each electric field are 210 kev or @xmath4 kev , respectively . although previous simulations treated inertial alfv@xmath0n waves [ lysak and song , 2008 ; jia and streltsov , 2014 ] , evolution of waves with a realistic field - aligned electric field is not still resolved .",
    "this study examined the other topic , i.e. , the effect of ionization by inverted - v type non - thermal electrons on the instability of shear alfv@xmath0n waves .",
    "these electrons with an energy of 210 kev strongly increase the conductivities in a height of 100120 km where horizontal currents that can couple with shear alfv@xmath0n waves maximize [ fang et al .",
    ", 2008 ] .",
    "the ionization rate by the non - thermal electrons was formulated as @xmath5 , @xmath6 : electron yielding coefficient , @xmath7 : field - aligned current by alfv@xmath0n waves [ lysak and song , 2002 ] .",
    "however , its effect on the growth of shear alfv@xmath0n waves was not clarified .",
    "this study analyzed the linear instability of shear alfv@xmath0n waves , including effects of ionization , in the magnetosphere - ionosphere ( m - i ) coupling system .",
    "we especially focused on the possibility that the threshold field value ( @xmath1 mv / m ) presented in our previous study is reduced to be a popular level in observations , e.g. , 1020 mv / m [ provan et al .",
    ", 2004 ; bristow and jensen , 2007 ] .",
    "the target region of our analysis is a magnetic flux tube that involves an auroral arc with a width of @xmath8 km .",
    "shear alfv@xmath0n waves , propagating along the magnetic field right above the arc , flow the field - aligned current @xmath7 into the ionosphere .",
    "it connects with horizontal currents caused by plasma convection .",
    "a situation is considered where the coupling of currents destabilizes shear alfv@xmath0n waves , implying the initial brightening of aurora .",
    "the field line position @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 at the ionosphere and @xmath11 at the magnetic equator .",
    "we consider a latitude of @xmath12 in the southern hemisphere , with the dipole @xmath13 value of @xmath14 and @xmath15 km .",
    "we take coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 orthogonal to each @xmath18 : @xmath19 points southward ( poleward ) and @xmath20 points eastward at @xmath10 .",
    "we set a local flux tube , e.g. , a square of ( @xmath21 ) at @xmath10 and a rectangle of ( @xmath22 km @xmath23 @xmath24 km ) at @xmath11 using @xmath25 km and dipole metrics ; see hiraki and watanabe [ 2011 ] for details .",
    "the dipole magnetic field is written as @xmath26 .",
    "the system has a convective electric field @xmath27 that is applied poleward ( @xmath28 ) and is uniform in every @xmath29-@xmath30 planes . with perturbed electric and magnetic fields of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",

    "@xmath38 is set to be constant as @xmath39 km / s along the field line .",
    "the alfv@xmath0n transit time is thus @xmath40 s.    by integrating the continuity equations of ions and electrons , the linearized equations @xmath41 are obtained for plasma motion at the ionosphere @xmath10 . here",

    "these equations couple with eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of shear alfv@xmath0n waves through field - aligned current @xmath7 .",
    "the electron yielding rate was set to be @xmath47 in hiraki [ 2015b ] by assuming continuity of the thermal electron flux . in this study , @xmath48 is given on the supposition that ionization of neutral particles occurs due to the non - thermal electron precipitation .    in order to solve eqs .",
    "( 1)(4 ) , field variables @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath42 are expanded such as @xmath51 with complex frequency @xmath52 and perpendicular wave number @xmath53 .",
    "the boundary condition at the magnetic equator is set to be @xmath54 , or @xmath55 ( zero current ) , and shapes of eigenfunctions @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath10@xmath58 are calculated .",
    "we can redefine the frequency @xmath59 in the frame of @xmath60 to be @xmath52 without loss of generality . from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we get the dispersion relation as @xmath61 here , two parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are introduced .",
    "the former means the convective drift frequency , while the latter corresponds to the pedersen / alfv@xmath0n impedance ratio @xmath64 .",
    "the ionospheric parameters used for the solution of eq .",
    "( 5 ) are set to be @xmath44/@xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67",
    "s@xmath68 , and @xmath69 m@xmath70/s . it is also noted that the ambient density and magnetic field are set to be @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 t.     of finite @xmath74 and @xmath75 modes , normalized by @xmath76 , in the nominal case of the electron yielding coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "the convection electric field is changed to be @xmath77 ( red ) , 15 , 20 , 25 ( purple ) , 30 , 35 , 40 , and 45 ( black ) mv / m . ]    -@xmath6 diagram of the growth rate @xmath78 of @xmath79 mode ; open circles show the cases of @xmath80 and crosses show the cases of @xmath81 .",

    "the simplest case is that there are an auroral arc in the ionosphere and alfv@xmath0n waves right above it .",
    "the @xmath84 mode is distinguished in the arc if its spatial scale is approximated to the gaussian distribution ; hereafter , wave number is normalized by @xmath85 .",
    "the arc without east - westward structures , i.e. , @xmath75 , is considered for simplicity .",
    "figure 1 shows the linear growth rates @xmath86 of ( @xmath87 , @xmath75 ) modes that were obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 5 ) under the conditions in sec .  [ sec : 2 ] . here , the electron yielding rate being @xmath47 , the response of @xmath78 to changes in the poleward electric field @xmath88 was found .",
    "we readily found the value of the critical field for @xmath89 to be @xmath90 mv / m .",
    "hiraki [ 2015b ] demonstrated that an arc quickly splits into two arcs due to a density perturbation produced by the poleward pedersen current .",
    "for the higher mode @xmath91 , we also evaluated the critical field for @xmath92 to be @xmath93 mv / m ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is , however , noted that a lower electric field , e.g.  10 mv / m , just before auroral intensification was estimated with superdarn radars [ provan et al . , 2004 ] .",
    "we investigate how the critical field for this ( 2 , 0 ) mode responds when @xmath6 ( @xmath94 ) is changed .",
    "figure 2 shows a diagram of @xmath95 in ( @xmath88 , @xmath6 ) space : open circle stands for the case of @xmath92 , while cross for the case of @xmath96 .",
    "it is clearly found that the critical value of @xmath88 for @xmath92 can be reduced if @xmath6 is increased .",
    "note that the term proportional to @xmath97 appears in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 5 ) in case of @xmath98 .",
    "it means that a mode is unstable for any set of @xmath6 and @xmath88 that satisfies @xmath99 ; the diffusion term ( @xmath46 ) slightly changes the relation to a fitting function @xmath100 for the open circle - cross boundary in fig .  2 .",
    "because the @xmath6 value has an upper limit in the real situation just before a faint arc starts to intensify , the critical @xmath88 necessarily has a lower limit .",
    "we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : 4 ] on the way to estimate the realistic range of @xmath6 values and the reason why we remove the possibility of higher modes @xmath101 .    at the end of this section",
    ", we describe the characteristics of eigenmodes in the moderate case of electric field @xmath77 mv / m .",
    "figure 3 shows the responses of real frequency @xmath102 , growth rate @xmath103 , and eigenfunction @xmath83 of the @xmath91 mode to a change in @xmath6 .",
    "the gradient of @xmath104 steepens in the lower @xmath74 side , owing to @xmath105 in eq .",
    "related to this change as @xmath6 increases , a sharp peak in @xmath78 appears and moves to the lower @xmath74 side .",
    "a high @xmath78 in the case of high @xmath6 is supported by the fact that the amplitude of eigenfunction @xmath83 at @xmath10 increases .",
    "let us first mention why the @xmath79 mode is chosen when the critical field @xmath106 for auroral intensification is proposed at the part of fig .",
    "2 . as pointed in secs .",
    "[ sec : 1 ] and [ sec : 3 ] , the critical value @xmath107 mv / m for the @xmath108 mode in case of @xmath47 is likely to be much higher than the typical value in observations [ bristow and jensen , 2007 ] .",
    "the growth rate increases with the mode number , and the critical field for @xmath109 is @xmath110 mv / m ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , we should start a speculation that @xmath91 , @xmath111 modes are produced through successive splits of an arc .",
    "it may require a very long time for the @xmath109 mode to emerge to cause an instability involving alfv@xmath0n waves .",
    "we suppose that an arc with a width of @xmath112 ( @xmath8 km ) , splitting into two arcs , requires to move at least a distance of @xmath112 by a drift in the critical field @xmath113 . producing @xmath114-arcs requires a distance of @xmath115 .",
    "the condition for this @xmath116-splitting is that the time scale @xmath117 is shorter than the time scale @xmath118 representing field changes .",
    "this relation is expressed as @xmath119 here , @xmath120 s and we determined @xmath121 and 17 mv / m ( @xmath122 and 0.34 km / s ) for @xmath91 and @xmath123 modes . substituting these values into eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we calculated @xmath124 and 58 s , respectively , and the latter does not satisfy the above inequality .",
    "thus , we are compelled to remove the possibility of the instability with higher modes @xmath101 .",
    "it is , however , noted that the @xmath123 mode can be preferable rather than the @xmath91 mode in the other specific case of eq .",
    "( 6 ) with a stretched magnetic field .    for motivations of future observations of electron energy spectrum just before auroral intensification , we illustrated the way to estimate a realistic @xmath6 value . equating it ,",
    "@xmath125 which meets @xmath126 . here ,",
    "@xmath127 stands for injected electron energy ( ev ) , @xmath128 the mean energy loss per ion pair production , and @xmath129 the ratio of the injected ( non - thermal ) electron flux to the thermal electron flux carrying alfv@xmath0nic @xmath7 . the typical value of @xmath128 was estimated to be 35 ev [ fang et al . , 2008 ; and references therein ] .",
    "generally , @xmath130 since we assumed the ionization term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) as a product @xmath5 of @xmath6 and @xmath7 proportional to the thermal electron flux .",
    "referring to the precipitating electron model by fang et al .  [",
    "2008 ] , we pick energies of @xmath131 or 10 kev that produce peaks in the ionization rate at our target region of 100120 km . for these energies , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively . we assume measured energy distributions with eiscat radars [ kirkwood et al . , 1990 ; olsson et al . , 1996 ] and",
    "dmsp satellite [ yago et al . , 2005 ] as a 1 kev maxwellian distribution , and roughly estimate the energy ratio @xmath129 to be up to @xmath134 . in this case , @xmath135 and 2.8 are obtained for 5 and 10 kev electrons , respectively .",
    "the above estimation of @xmath6 values is supported by the assumption that an inverted - v potential right above the arc keeps a robust energy spectrum including accelerated electrons .",
    "however , it has a possibility to change the @xmath6 value ( even a slight change ) if the inertial alfv@xmath0n wave supplies @xmath4 kev accelerated electrons ; here , we refer to the stopping height of 1 kev electrons being @xmath136 km [ fang et al . ,",
    "although we did not consider any dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 , @xmath6 could correlate with @xmath7 of shear alfv@xmath0n waves through @xmath137 of inertial alfv@xmath0n waves .",
    "the linear form of @xmath5 may be corrected in our future studies that treat both waves .",
    "our prime suggestion for future observations is that an increase in the ionization rate by non - thermal electrons can reduce the threshold field , to a great extent , of instabilities of alfv@xmath0n waves related to auroral intensification .",
    "however , compared to the average energy component carrying @xmath7 , the amount of the non - thermal component is limited .",
    "the @xmath6 value has an upper limit , and thus @xmath106 value has a lower limit .",
    "superdarn radar observations revealed that the convection speed in the vicinity of arcs exceeds @xmath138 m / s over @xmath139 min before onsets of auroral intensification [ bristow and jensen , 2007 ] ; the time scale ( @xmath140 ) is reasonable for shear alfv@xmath0n waves to be amplified [ see hiraki , 2015b ] . with the magnetic field of @xmath73 t",
    ", the speed corresponds to the electric field of @xmath141 mv / m .",
    "the rate @xmath1424 is sufficient for instabilities of the waves , if this field value is regarded as the threshold .",
    "however , we need the higher rate @xmath1436 , if future precise and statistical observations will present a lower value , e.g. , @xmath144 mv / m . we urge fascinating field / particle observations to determine both the lower limit of threshold fields and the upper limit of @xmath6 values .",
    "this study investigated changes in the threshold electric field @xmath106 of plasma convection , causing a linear instability of alfv@xmath0n waves , due to the ionization ( @xmath6 ) by precipitating auroral electrons .",
    "we clarified that the value of @xmath106 is reduced in the cases of @xmath145 .",
    "a realistic value of @xmath146 , sufficient for a fast growth of waves , was obtained from observed electron energy spectra . in future ,",
    "our results motivate the thorough search for the @xmath6 value with electron energy spectra at auroral breakup and precise measurements of convection electric fields by radars .",
