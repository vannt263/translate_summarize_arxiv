    "[ fig : e0 ] , strongly suggests that the sfe approach is not appropriate for estimating results for the integer - spin haldane systems .",
    "we recall that a nel state is chosen as the unperturbed state when performing the sfe , and the vbs character of the haldane phase is ignored .",
    "we expect physical results to be obtainable from a different expansion assuming the aklt model [ @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aklt ] ) ] as the unperturbed hamiltonian and starting from the exact vbs ground - state@xcite at @xmath17 , treating @xmath133 as the expansion parameter",
    ". such an expansion would require the application of the linked - cluster formalism to valence - bond states , something that , to the best of our knowledge , has not yet been tried and that would constitute an interesting topic for future work .",
    "summarizing , we have investigated the one - dimensional @xmath0 antiferromagnet with single - ion anisotropy , described by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , by means of linked - cluster series expansions and qmc simulations .",
    "our estimates for the zero - temperature phase transitions in this model are more precise than previous ones and could be used as benchmarks in future explorations of the applicability of quantum information tools to the study of quantum critical phenomena .    our best estimate for the dh critical point [ @xmath134 has been obtained from a scaling analysis of the spin - stiffness @xmath48 from qmc simulations .",
    "the spin - stiffness remains finite at the transition in the thermodynamic limit [ @xmath80 ] and vanishes elsewhere , implying a  peaked behavior \" for finite systems .",
    "our result for @xmath136 agrees with the estimate@xcite obtained by tzeng et al.@xcite [ @xmath137 , the same being true for the estimate for the correlation length critical exponent : @xmath54 ( present work ) and @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( ref .  ) .",
    "we have further obtained results for the dispersion relation and gap for excitations in the large-@xmath3 region that may be of direct experimental relevance given , for instance , the current interest on the large-@xmath3 compound dtn.@xcite our series for the excited states in the large-@xmath3 phase have a considerably more extended range of applicability compared to the strong coupling results of papanicolaou and spathis,@xcite and are available on request .    precise results for the hn phase transition have been obtained from a linked - cluster expansion ( ne ) for holon - like excitations . by analyzing the gap for these excited states we have arrived at the estimates @xmath103 and @xmath138 .",
    "the former compares well with the result@xcite @xmath139 from ref .   while the latter confirms that the hn transition belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model , with the exact exponent @xmath140 .    finally",
    ", we have shown evidence that the sfe expansion of singh@xcite does not converge to the haldane gap at @xmath15 . instead",
    ", we propose an expansion around the aklt state [ the exact ground - state for the hamiltonian eq .",
