    "soon after the attractor mechanism was first discovered in supersymmetric ( bps ) black holes @xcite , it was reformulated in terms of motion on an effective potential for the moduli @xcite .",
    "ferrara et al demonstrated that the critical points of this potential correspond to the attractor values of the moduli .",
    "more recently , several groups used the effective potential to show that non - supersymmetric ( non - bps ) extremal black holes can also exhibit the attractor mechanism , thereby creating a new and exciting field of research @xcite .",
    "many connections between non - bps attractors and other active areas of string theory soon revealed themselves .",
    "andrianopoli et al found that both bps and non - bps black holes embedded in a supergravity with a symmetric moduli space can be studied using the same formalism , and they uncovered many intricate relations between the two @xcite .",
    "dabholkar , sen and trivedi proposed a microstate counting for non - bps black holes ( albeit subject to certain constraints @xcite ) .",
    "saraikin and vafa suggested that a new extension of topological string theory generalizes the ooguri - strominger - vafa ( osv ) formula such that it is also valid for non - supersymmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "studying non - bps attractors could also give insight into non - supersymmetric flux vacua .",
    "given all these possible applications , it is important to characterize non - bps black holes as fully as possible .",
    "there has been a great deal of progress in understanding the near - horizon region of these non - bps attractors .",
    "the second derivative of the effective potential at the critical point determines whether the black hole is an attractor , and the location of the critical point yields the values of the moduli at the horizon ; in this way , one can compute the stability and attractor moduli for all models with cubic prepotential @xcite .",
    "however , the effective potential has only been formulated for the leading - order terms in the supergravity lagrangian .",
    "if one wants to include higher - derivative corrections , one can instead use sen s entropy formalism , which incorporates wald s formula , to characterize the near - horizon geometry in greater generality @xcite .",
    "sen s method has led to many new results @xcite .",
    "the tradeoff is that this method can not be used to determine any properties of the solution away from the horizon .",
    "the bps attractor flow is constructed from the attractor value @xmath1 by simply replacing the d - brane charges with the corresponding harmonic functions : @xmath2 where the harmonic functions are @xmath3 moreover , this procedure can be applied to construct the multi - centered bps attractor flow that describes the supersymmetric black hole bound state @xcite , where the harmonic functions are generalized to have multiple centers : @xmath4 it is conjectured in @xcite that the non - bps flow can be generated in the same fashion , namely , by replacing the charges in the attractor value with the corresponding harmonic functions . however , as will be proven in this paper , this procedure does not work for systems with generic charge and asymptotic moduli .    in principle",
    ", one could construct the full non - bps flow ( the black hole metric , together with the attractor flow of the moduli ) by solving the equation of motion derived from the lagrangian .",
    "however , this is a second - order differential equation and only reduces to a first - order equation upon demanding the preservation of supersymmetry .",
    "ceresole et al have written down an equivalent first - order equation in terms of a `` fake superpotential '' , but so far , the fake superpotential can only be explicitly constructed for special charges and asymptotic moduli @xcite .",
    "the most generic non - bps equation of motion is complicated enough that it has not yet been solved .",
    "similarly , multi - centered non - bps black holes have not been studied .",
    "our goal is to construct the full flow for non - bps stationary black holes in four dimensions . instead of directly solving the equation of motion ,",
    "we reduce the action on the timelike isometry and dualize all 4d vectors to scalars . the new moduli space",
    "@xmath5 contains isometries corresponding to all the charges of the black hole , and the black hole solutions are simply geodesics on @xmath5 .",
    "this method was introduced in @xcite and has been used to construct static and rotating black holes in heterotic string theory @xcite and to study the classical bps single - centered flow and its radial quantization @xcite .    in this paper , we work in two specific theories of gravity , but we expect that this method can be used for any model whose @xmath6 is symmetric .",
    "the basic technique is reviewed in more detail in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we show how this method works in a simple case : the toroidal compactification of @xmath7-dimensional pure gravity .",
    "section 4 serves as an introduction to single - centered attractor flow in @xmath0 supergravity coupled to one vector multiplet , and sections 5 and 6 are dedicated to constructing the full flows for both bps and non - bps single - centered black holes with generic charges .",
    "we find that they are generated by the action of different classes of nilpotent elements in the coset algebra .",
    "both types of flows are shown to reach the correct attractor values at the horizon . in section 7 , the procedure is generalized straightforwardly to construct both bps and non - bps multi - centered solutions .",
    "we use a metric ansatz with a flat spatial slice and we are able to recover the bps bound states described by bates and denef . using the same ansatz , we are able to build non - bps multi - centered solutions .",
    "unfortunately , solutions generated this way turn out to always have charges at each center which are mutually local .",
    "the last section reviews our conclusions and suggests possibilities for future work .",
    "here we outline the method we will use to construct black hole solutions .",
    "this method was first described in @xcite .",
    "we first reduce a general gravity action from four dimensions down to three , and derive the equation of motion .",
    "we then specialize to certain theories which have a 3d description in terms of a symmetric coset space . in such situations",
    ", we can easily find solutions to the equation of motion .",
    "the solutions are geodesics ( or generalizations thereof ) on the 3d moduli space and they are generated by elements of the coset algebra .",
    "we will study stationary solutions in a theory with gravity coupled to scalar and vector matter .",
    "let the scalars be @xmath8 and the vectors be @xmath9 .",
    "then the most general ansatz for a stationary solution in four dimensions is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 label the spatial directions and bold font denotes three - dimensional fields and operators .",
    "since none of the fields are time - dependent , we can compactify on the time isometry and reduce to three - dimensional space @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure is called the @xmath13-map . in three dimensions ,",
    "a vector is hodge - dual to a scalar .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath14 and the gauge fields allow us to define the dual scalars @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we then obtain the 3d lagrangian in terms of only scalars @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the moduli fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the space time metric and @xmath21 is the metric of a manifold @xmath12 .",
    "the system is @xmath22 gravity minimally coupled to a nonlinear sigma model with moduli space @xmath12 .",
    "next , we will find the equation of motion in this theory .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath22 gravity is einstein s equation : @xmath23 and the equation of motion of the moduli is : @xmath24 for simplicity , we consider only the case where the @xmath22 spatial slice is flat ( it is guaranteed to be flat only for extremal single - centered black holes ) .",
    "then the dynamics of the moduli are decoupled from that of the @xmath22 gravity : @xmath25 in the multi - centered case , we need to solve the full equations for the moduli as functions of the 3d coordinates @xmath26 . for single - centered solutions ,",
    "the moduli only depend on @xmath27 ; to satisfy the above equations , the motion of the moduli must follow null geodesics inside @xmath12 .",
    "a generic null geodesic flows to the boundary of the moduli space @xmath12 .",
    "a single - centered attractor flow is defined as a null geodesic that terminates at a point on the @xmath28 boundary and in the interior region with respect to all other coordinates .",
    "this is guaranteed for the bps attractor by the constraints imposed by the supersymmetry . to find the single - centered non - supersymmetric attractor flow",
    ", one needs to find a way to construct null geodesics and a constraint that pick out the ones that stop at this specific component of the boundary . in the next section",
    ", we will show that we can do this for models with special properties , and the method can be easily generalized to find the multi - centered attractor solution .",
    "the problem of finding such a constraint in a generic model is not easy . to simplify ,",
    "we study any model whose moduli space is a symmetric homogeneous space : @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath12 is a homogeneous space , the isometry group @xmath30 acts transitively on @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath31 denotes the isotropy group , which is the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath30 when one compactifies on a spatial isometry down to @xmath32 space , or the analytical continuation of the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath30 when one compactifies on the time isometry down to @xmath33 space .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath34 has the cartan decomposition : @xmath35 where @xmath36=\\mathbf{h } \\qquad [ \\mathbf{h},\\mathbf{k}]=\\mathbf{k}\\ ] ] when @xmath30 is semi - simple , the homogeneous space is symmetric , and @xmath37=\\mathbf{h}\\ ] ]    the models with symmetric moduli space includes : @xmath7-dimensional gravity toroidally compactified to four dimensions , certain models of 4d @xmath38 supergravity coupled to vector - multiplet , and all 4d @xmath39 extended supergravity .",
    "the entropy of the last two classes is u - duality invariant . in the present paper",
    ", we will only consider the first two classes , namely , the @xmath7-dimensional gravity toroidally compactified to four dimensions , and the 4d @xmath38 supergravity coupled to @xmath40 vector - multiplet .",
    "the left - invariant current is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coset representative , and @xmath43 is the projection of @xmath44 onto the coset algebra @xmath45 .",
    "the lagrangian density of the sigma - model with target space @xmath46 is given by @xmath43 as : @xmath47    the geodesic of the homogeneous space written in terms of the coset representative is simply @xmath48 where @xmath49 parameterizes the initial point , and the @xmath50 is for later convenience .",
    "a null geodesic has zero length : @xmath51 therefore , in a homogeneous space , we can find the null geodesics that end at an attractor point by imposing the appropriate constraint on the null elements of the coset algebra .",
    "since @xmath42 is defined up to the action of the isotropy group @xmath31 , in order to read off the moduli fields from @xmath42 in an @xmath31-independent way , we construct the symmetric matrix using the metric signature matrix @xmath52 : @xmath53 in all systems considered in the present paper , @xmath31 is the maximal orthogonal subgroup of @xmath30 with the correct signature : @xmath54 that is , the isotropy group @xmath31 preserves the symmetric metric matrix @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 is invariant under @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , as the isotropy group @xmath31 acts transitively on the space of of matrices with a given signature , the space of possible @xmath55 is the same as the symmetric space @xmath46 .",
    "that is , the moduli of @xmath46 can be combined into the symmetric matrix @xmath55 . and the current of @xmath55 is @xmath58    it is easy to perform the projection onto the coset algebra @xmath45 .",
    "the ( generalized ) orthogonality condition of the isotropy group @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of the subalgebra element @xmath59 which is in @xmath60 as @xmath61 in other words , @xmath62 is anti - symmetric : @xmath63 .",
    "thus the coset algebra , being the compliment of @xmath64 , can be defined as the @xmath45 with @xmath65 being symmetric : @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 therefore , the projection of an element @xmath68 in @xmath34 onto the coset algebra @xmath45 is : @xmath69 for the left - invariant current @xmath70 , the projection onto @xmath45 is : @xmath71    it is straightforward to show that the current constructed from @xmath55 is related to the projected left - invariant current @xmath43 by : @xmath72 the lagrangian in terms of @xmath55 is thus @xmath73 .",
    "that is , the lagrangian density is @xmath74 which is invariant under the action of the isometry group @xmath30 : @xmath75 and whose conserved current is : @xmath76 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath55 in @xmath77 , since we will only be dealing with this current from now on .",
    "the equation of motion is the conservation of the current : @xmath78    we now specialize to the single - centered solutions : they correspond to geodesics in the coset manifold .",
    "the spherical symmetry allows the @xmath79 metric to be parameterized as @xmath80 then the equations of motion involve the operator @xmath81 , and reduce to geodesic equations in terms of a parameter @xmath82 such that @xmath83 the function @xmath84 is then determined from the equations of motion of @xmath79 gravity .",
    "the equations of motion can be written as @xmath85 in the extremal limit the geodesics become null , the @xmath79 metric is flat and @xmath86    in the search for multi - centered extremal solutions , where the spherical symmetry is absent , it is very convenient to restrict to solutions with a flat 3d metric .",
    "this is consistent with the equations of motion as long as the @xmath79 energy momentum tensor is zero everywhere : @xmath87 the coupled problem with generic non - flat @xmath79 metric is much harder , and exact solutions are hard to find unless a second killing vector is present .",
    "since different values of the scalars at infinity are easily obtained by a @xmath30 transformation , to start with , we will consider the flow starting from @xmath88 , and generalize to generic asymptotic moduli later .",
    "for a single - centered solution , the flow of @xmath42 is @xmath89 . since all the coset representatives can be brought into the form @xmath90 with some @xmath91 by an @xmath31-action , we can write @xmath92 , so @xmath93 .",
    "and the flow of @xmath55 is @xmath94 the charges of the solution are read from the conserved currents @xmath95",
    "now we use the method introduced in the previous section to analyze pure gravity toroidally compactified down to four dimensions .",
    "we explain why the attractor flow generator , @xmath96 , needs to be nilpotent , and we find the jordan forms of @xmath97 and @xmath96 . using this information , we construct single - centered attractor flows .",
    "we then generalize to multicentered black holes in pure gravity and show that these solutions have mutually local charges and no intrinsic angular momentum .",
    "the simplest example of a system that admits a @xmath79 description in terms of a sigma model on a symmetric space is pure gravity in @xmath7 dimensions , compactified on a @xmath98 torus .",
    "the kk reduction to @xmath99 parameterizes the metric as @xmath100 here @xmath101 are the torus coordinates , @xmath102 the coordinates on @xmath103 , and @xmath104 the metric of the torus .",
    "a @xmath99 metric with one timelike killing spinor is then parameterized as @xmath105 where @xmath106 , to connect with the parametrization in the later part of the paper ; and @xmath107 denote the @xmath79 space coordinates .",
    "the two expressions combine as @xmath108 here @xmath109 are the torus coordinates plus time , @xmath110 coordinates on @xmath111 and @xmath112 and @xmath113 is : @xmath114    if the forms @xmath115 are dualized to scalars @xmath116 as @xmath117 the various scalars can be combined into a symmetric unimodular @xmath118 matrix @xmath119 in terms of the @xmath99 fields that is @xmath120    the equations of motion derive from the lagrangian density @xmath121 , invariant under @xmath122 for any @xmath123 in @xmath124 .",
    "as this @xmath124 action is transitive on the space of matrices with a given signature , the space of possible @xmath55 is the same as the symmetric space @xmath125 .",
    "notice that the signature of the stabilizer @xmath126 is appropriate for the reduction from @xmath127 to @xmath128 signature .",
    "the usual reduction from @xmath127 to @xmath129 would give a @xmath130 , while the euclidean reduction from @xmath131 to @xmath128 gives @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the coset representative under the left @xmath126 action can be described in terms of a set of vielbeins @xmath133 as @xmath134 then the symmetric @xmath126 invariant matrix @xmath135 can be used to read off the solution more easily . without loss of generality ,",
    "we can take @xmath52 to be the signature matrix : @xmath136    the equations of motion are equivalent to the conservation of the @xmath124 currents @xmath137 .",
    "some of those currents correspond to the usual gauge currents in 4d : the first @xmath98 elements of the last column @xmath138 are the kk monopole currents , the first @xmath98 elements of the row before the last @xmath139 are the kk momentum currents and the element @xmath140 is the current for the @xmath79 gauge field @xmath14 .",
    "regular @xmath99 solutions must have zero sources for this current , otherwise @xmath14 will not be single valued .",
    "we now show that all the attractor flows are generated by the nilpotent generators in the coset algebra . to get extremal black hole solutions with a near horizon @xmath141 , the function @xmath142 must scale as @xmath143 as @xmath27 goes to zero while the scalars go to a constant .",
    "this makes @xmath55 diverge as @xmath144 .",
    "the most natural way for @xmath55 to diverge as @xmath145 for large @xmath82 is that @xmath96 is nilpotent , with @xmath146 this will be the crucial condition through the whole paper .",
    "not every null geodesic corresponds to extremal black hole solutions .",
    "let s consider a simple example : hyperkhler euclidean metrics in @xmath99 .    although this example is not about a black hole , it is still quite instructive .",
    "the @xmath79 sigma model is @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath148 . the coset representative is written as @xmath149 and the symmetric invariant @xmath150    a geodesic is the exponential of a lie algebra element in the orthogonal to the stabilizer .",
    "the stabilizer @xmath151 is generated by @xmath152 .",
    "a null geodesic is hence the exponential of @xmath153 .",
    "this is a nilpotent matrix , @xmath154 , hence @xmath155 .",
    "take : @xmath156 then @xmath157 and we can read off the geodesic solution from the invariant @xmath158 hence @xmath159 dualizing @xmath160 , we get @xmath161    the 4d euclidean metric is just the taub - nut metric .",
    "notice that the multi - centered taub - nut generalization of the metric is obtained by replacing @xmath82 above with some harmonic function @xmath162 .",
    "the sigma model equations of motion are equivalent to the conservation of the current @xmath163 , and if @xmath55 is given as above with @xmath164 then the equation of motion are @xmath165        now we look in detail at the single - centered black holes in pure gravity . notice that as @xmath142 goes to zero @xmath55 tends asymptotically to a rank one matrix @xmath166 hence the matrix @xmath97 should also have rank @xmath167",
    ". by inspection of @xmath55 it is clear that a @xmath97 of rank higher than one gives a geodesic for which the matrix elements of @xmath168 also diverge as @xmath145 so that the scalar fields do not converge to fixed attractor values .",
    "notice that if @xmath96 is nilpotent , then @xmath55 is a polynomial in @xmath169 , and the various scalars in the solution will all be simple functions of @xmath27 for such extremal solutions !",
    "the explicit form for @xmath96 in terms of the charges is then straightforward to write .",
    "consider the jordan form of @xmath97 : as it is nilpotent , the eigenvalues are all zero .",
    "as it is rank one , it has one single indecomposable block of size two : @xmath170 .",
    "it is written as @xmath171with @xmath172 null in the metric @xmath173 , and @xmath174 any degree - two homogeneous function of the charge @xmath175 .",
    "this form is chosen so that @xmath172 does not scale with the charge @xmath175 .",
    "then @xmath96 must have a jordan form with all eigenvalues zero , one block of size @xmath176 : @xmath177 and possibly some other extra blocks of size two .",
    "alternatively , there is a subspace @xmath178 annihilated by @xmath96 , a subspace @xmath179 whose image under @xmath96 sits in @xmath178 and has the same dimension as @xmath179 , and a single vector @xmath180 such that @xmath181 and is non - zero .",
    "@xmath182 from the symmetry of @xmath183 , it follows that the space @xmath184 is made of null vectors only , and that @xmath185 is orthogonal to it . because @xmath186 , @xmath187 is negative .",
    "because of the signature of @xmath173 it is straightforward to see that @xmath179 can be of dimension at most one ; hence there are no blocks of size @xmath188 in the jordan form of @xmath96 .    taking this into account ,",
    "the final form of @xmath96 is simply @xmath189 where @xmath172 and @xmath180 are two orthogonal @xmath190-dimensional vectors with @xmath172 being null and @xmath180 having norm @xmath191 : @xmath192 using the fact that in @xmath96 , the first @xmath98 elements of the last column @xmath193 are the magnetic charges , and the first @xmath98 elements of the row before the last @xmath194 are the electric charges , and the element @xmath195 is the taub - nut charge , which has to vanish , we have @xmath196 conditions . together with the three constraints coming from the norms and orthogonality condition ( [ vwnorm ] ) ,",

    "we will see later that it instead imposes a stringent constraint on the allowed d - brane charges in the multi - centered non - bps solution .",
    "secondly , unlike the bps flow , replacing @xmath639 in the attractor moduli by the harmonic function @xmath660 is not equivalent to replacing the charges @xmath213 with @xmath623 as in ( [ qharmonincprocedure ] ) .",
    "the twistor @xmath434 here is no longer free , but is determined in terms of the charges as a root of the degree - six equation ( [ zfromqnb ] ) , so replacing @xmath213 by @xmath661 , for generic @xmath213 and @xmath59 , would not leave @xmath434 invariant .",
    "therefore , the generic non - bps flow can not be given by the naive harmonic function procedure , as proposed by kallosh et al @xcite .",
    "next , we will define the subset of the nonbps single - centered flow that can be constructed by the harmonic function procedure .    when the attractor has only @xmath662 charges , namely , @xmath663 , ( [ zfromqnb ] ) has a root @xmath664 , which is independent of the value of charges .",
    "if the asymptotic moduli @xmath59 is also of the form of @xmath665 , replacing @xmath666 by @xmath667 would leave the solution @xmath664 invariant .",

    "in constrast to the bps case , @xmath68 does not enter the equation .",

    "we conclude that , in total , there will be @xmath749 constraints on the allowed charges .",
    "now we will show in detail the derivation of the constraints .",

    "a related fact is that the the angular momentum is zero .    like the non - bps single - centered case ,",

    "the reason is again due to the fact that the twistor @xmath434 , being a function of charges , does not remain invariant under this substitution of charges by harmonic functions .",
    "the multi - centered non - bps solutions that can be generated by the harmonic function procedure are those with @xmath759 being the image of a single @xmath675 on the @xmath760 of a pure @xmath662 system : @xmath761 it appears that the existence of a simple linear ansatz for  superimposing \" single center solutions exists in general only for mutually local extremal black holes , and only in the supersymmetric case does it extend to mutually non - local centers .    to summarize , the non - bps multi - centered solution is different from the bps case because it imposes no constraints on the position of the centers , but instead on the allowed charges @xmath709 : the choice of charges at each center are restricted to a three - dimensional subspace , and they are mutually local .",
    "the result is that the centers can move freely , and there is no angular momentum in the system .",

    "we have also generalized the geodesics to find solutions for non - bps and bps multi - centered black holes .",
    "the bps multi - centered solution reproduces the known solution of bates and denef .",
