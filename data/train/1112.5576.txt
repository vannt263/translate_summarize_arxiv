    "neutrinos give the unique opportunity to probe axial structure of nucleons , that is why clear theoretical interpretation of experimental data on axial nucleon ffs is of great importance .",
    "moreover , precise knowledge of weak nucleon ffs is vital for present and future accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments .    in this work",
    "we suggest phenomenological baryon - meson gauge theory of @xmath1-decay and charged current quasi elastic ( ccqe ) @xmath2 scattering .",
    "in particular , we introduce multipole expansions of ccqe form factors and compare the results with available experimental data .",
    "we studied only free nucleon processes , nuclear effects were not taken into account .",
    "ccqe processes are parameterized by four functions of @xmath3 : two vector @xmath4 and two axial @xmath5 form factors .",
    "however vector ffs are not independent , they can be expressed in terms of ones from elastic electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "this relation originates from conserved vector current hypotheses ( cvc ) @xcite : @xmath6 so far as this work is just a generalization of the theory of @xmath7 elastic scattering presented in @xcite to the neutrino processes we consider vector weak ffs as well determined .",
    "besides , contribution of @xmath8 to the cross section is proportional to lepton mass , so in case of light leptons ( non @xmath9-lepton processes ) it is usually neglected .",
    "thus , in this paper we will focus on only @xmath10 .",
    "the main assumption of the model is the vector and axial vector * meson dominance*. in case of charged current @xmath2 interaction it claims that intermediate vector @xmath11 bosons hadronize to the sets of vector and axial mesons , so interaction between neutrino and nucleon occurs via meson exchange .    in order to account the sets of mesons with different masses we use * multigauge approach*. use of multigauge groups allows to introduce a set of gauge fields with their own coupling parameters , for example in dirac terms of lagrangian it means : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a coupling constant , @xmath14 is any fermionic field , @xmath15 is generation ( family ) index , @xmath16 is a total number of generations ( will be discussed later ) , @xmath17 are multigauge fields and @xmath18 - are actual parameters of the theory . following relation is required to save gauge invariance : @xmath19 this is the first sum rule ( sr ) imposed on parameters . moreover , to account anomalous magnetic dipole moment of nucleon pauli terms are necessary : @xmath20 however there is no similar relation for @xmath21 motivated by gauge symmetries .",
    "thus we have two types of parameters : dirac @xmath22 and pauli @xmath23 .",
    "full theory of both neutral and charged current @xmath24 interactions involves at least four sets of mesons which could be classified by @xmath25 isotopic chiral groups . in case of charged currents , only sets of isovector mesons @xmath26 and @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath28 have to be taking into consideration , while isoscalar @xmath29 which are formed by @xmath30 gauge fields act only in elastic @xmath2 and @xmath7 scattering .",
    "finally , * chiral symmetry * of strong interactions requires coupling constants of left and right fields to be equal and this way reduces number of parameters .",
    "moreover , it leads to equality of @xmath31 and @xmath32 coupling .",
    "consequently , parameters of vector and axial form factors will be the same .    by adding nucleon - meson terms to the standard model lepton doublets we receive fermionic sector of lagrangian . in order to construct effective",
    "lepton - meson vertexes one has to introduce higgs fields as a representation of both mesonic and electro - weak gauge groups . to generate meson masses",
    "additional higgs fields are required .",
    "summary of the objects of the theory is given in the table :    @xmath33 u^{ew}(1 ) \\times u^{i}_r(1 ) \\times su^{i}_r(2 )                                \\\\[5pt ] u^{i}_l(1 ) \\times su^{i}_l(2 ) \\times u^{i}_r(1 ) \\times su^{i}_r(2 )        \\\\[5pt ] u^{i}_l(1 )   \\times u^{i}_r(1 )                                             \\\\[5pt ] u^{ew}(1 ) \\times su_l^{ew}(2 ) \\end{array }   & \\begin{array}{c } \\sim   m_\\rho^2                            \\\\[5pt ] \\sim   m_\\rho^2                               \\\\[5pt ] \\sim   m_{a_1}^2 - m_\\rho^2       \\\\[5pt ] \\sim   m^2_f- m_\\omega^2           \\\\[5pt ] \\sim   m_w^2 \\end{array } \\\\",
    "\\hline \\end{array}\\ ] ]    assuming chiral symmetry of the vacuum we put vacuum shifts of left and right ( 1st and 2nd in the table ) higgs fields equal .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking generates quadratic form of boson fields .",
    "its diagonalization leads to the small mixing ( only charged bosons considered ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "this way lepton - meson vertex is introduced .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom have to be mixed with the standard model higgs boson and then identified with additional meson sets .",
    "however lepton - higgs vertex is suppressed by enormous ( 245 gev ) value of vacuum shift , so contribution of these mesons is expected to be small and it has been neglected .",
    "after lagrangian had been constructed one could study real physical processes .",
    "standard expression for squared @xmath1-decay amplitude which originates from fermi theory of weak interactions is following : @xmath36 is the fermi constant , where @xmath37 is the coupling constant of @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the cabibbo mixing angle , @xmath40 @xcite is a dimensionless phenomenological parameter , precisely determined by experiments .    squared amplitude has been calculated within the framework of the theory as well and parameters of the theory has been identified with ones from the fermi theory .",
    "thus , @xmath41 is formed by mixing parameters , coupling constants of gauge groups and meson propagators at @xmath42 ; @xmath43 must be inserted due to hadronization via non - perturbative @xmath44 twist , and finally we have got the following expression for @xmath45 : @xmath46    taking into account this relation and the fact that parameters @xmath18 are the same for both electron and cc neutrino parts of the theory one had to refit data on electron scattering . this has been done and no any significant changes occurred , parameters have not changed a lot .",
    "as we have already mentioned the main purpose of studying ccqe scatterng was fitting of @xmath10 . at low @xmath47 region",
    "the conventional dipole form of axial form factor reveals satisfactory fit of the experimental data : @xmath48 it is parameterized by the @xmath1-decay constant @xmath45 and the phenomenological parameter @xmath49 , the so - called axial - vector dipole mass .    within the framework of presented model we have obtained the following multipole expressions of form factors : @xmath50     \\widetilde{g}_1(q^2)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{w_i \\ m^2_{a_{1i } } } { m^2_{\\rho_{i}}+q^2 }            \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] to reproduce the correct asymptotic behavior of the form factors at infinity",
    "the additional sum rules are required : @xmath51     f_2(q^2 ) \\sim \\dfrac{1}{q^6 }   \\qquad & \\to \\qquad     &     \\begin{array}{c }      \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\varkappa_i \\",
    "m^2_{\\rho_{i } } = 0\\\\[10pt ]      \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\varkappa_i \\ m^4_{\\rho_{i } } = 0     \\end{array }               \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    besides , from ( [ relff ] ) and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are magnetic moments of proton and neutron correspondingly we get : @xmath55    now let us discuss the number of meson generations @xmath16 .",
    "we have obtained six sum rules ( [ sr1 ] ) , ( [ alpha ] ) , ( [ sr2 ] ) , ( [ sr3 ] ) which have to be imposed on parameters . to satisfy them at least three generations must be taken into account .",
    "the first reason to use only three families is that there is no precise data on heavy axial mesons .",
    "another one is that contribution of @xmath56 mesons is suppressed by increasing mass . and finally , three generations fit of electron data was accurate enough . in the case of @xmath57 both sets of parameters @xmath18 and @xmath58 @xmath59 are determined from six sum rules .",
    "thus , we consider only three generations , however in the theory there is no any restrictions on number @xmath16 .",
    "these mesons are following : @xmath60    to account pqcd asymptotes in high @xmath47 region one has to multiply form factors ( [ ffs ] ) on logarithmic functions @xmath61 of @xmath47 calculated for dirac @xmath62 and pauli @xmath63 ffs in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the general expression is following : @xmath64 where all the parameters @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 are the same with ones used in electron part of theory .",
    "so , they have been already determined from electron data .",
    "thus we obtain final expressions of ffs : @xmath68    we emphasize that _ there is no free fit parameters _ in final ffs .",
    "so , we present just a of @xmath2 form factors based on @xmath7 data but not fit . as we have already mentioned nuclear effects",
    "was out of consideration .",
    "the comparison of @xmath10 from ( [ ffs_final ] ) with available deuterium experiments @xcite,@xcite,@xcite is presented in the fig .",
    "we are planning to apply this multigauge scheme based on chiral symmetry and meson dominance to the neutral current as well and thus to complete the full theory of ( quasi)elastic lepton - nucleon interactions which consists of three parts :    1 .",
    "elastic electron - nucleon scattering ( presented in @xcite ) 2 .   charged current quasi elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering ( shortly described here ) 3 .",
    "neutral current elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering ( under investigation at the moment )    the third part is more complicated then previous ones because of mixing of five boson fields ( @xmath69,@xmath70 , @xmath71 - mesons , @xmath72-boson and photon ) .",
    "moreover , in order to introduce effective @xmath71-lepton vertex an additional mixing mechanism is required .",
    "it is based on the fact that stress tensor of @xmath73 groups is gauge invariant , so cross term in the kinematic sector of the lagrangian is not forbidden : @xmath74 here @xmath75 field corresponds to @xmath76 group , @xmath77 .",
    "diagonalization of both kinematic and higgs sectors leads to the required mixing .",
