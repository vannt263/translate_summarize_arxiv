    "ecosystems have become paradigmatic examples of complex systems , showing organization and collective dynamics across very different time and spatial scales @xcite .",
    "these features are captured by non trivial relationships among measurable quantities , which take forms familiar to statistical physics .",
    "well known examples include the species - area scaling relationship @xcite , allometric relations @xcite , and the occurrence of power laws in the distributions of species lifetime and size of extinction events @xcite .",
    "these statistical laws have been measured over many orders of magnitude and exhibit similar patterns across very different living ecosystems and also in different quantitative studies of fossil records @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of these patterns @xcite suggests that they may be amenable to be studied in a general and a - specific framework .    in this article",
    ", we will address the issue of species ( or more general taxa ) lifetime distribution .",
    "although the analysis of fossil records has recently highlighted several patterns in the evolution of biodiversity , and motivated the proposition of different mechanisms that may have caused these patterns , the functional form of the species lifetime distribution remains a debated issue . according to several studies @xcite",
    ", species lifetime seems to be exponentially distributed .",
    "others have found evidences of power law behavior with exponent close to -2 if genera , and therefore longer time scales , are considered ( @xcite , see also @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "keitt and stanley @xcite analyzed data sets from the _ north american breeding bird survey _ ( http://www.mbr.nbs.gov ) finding a power law distribution for species lifetime ( in their study defined as the time between colonization and local extinction ) with an exponent close to @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , the detailed analysis of newman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite of the data by raup @xcite has shown how both these hypothesis consistently fit the data and , when a power law fit is applied , an exponent between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is estimated .    on the theoretical side , these different , not to say contrasting ,",
    "findings have been invoked to support different macro - ecological theories .",
    "the power law behavior with exponent @xmath11 is to be expected when species dynamics can be regarded as a critical branching process @xcite where two or more species species can originate at a random moment from a common ancestor and , also randomly , get extinct .",
    "an exponential behavior in the lifetime distribution is often referred to as van valen s law @xcite .",
    "the mechanism proposed by van valen in support of this view is commonly known as the red queen effect : there may be no time enough for a species to gain evolutionary advantage over competing species before the rapidly changing environment completely re - draws the fitness landscape . as a consequence ,",
    "the extinction probability of any species does not depend on time and an exponential behavior for lifetimes distribution easily follows .",
    "several data sets support these conclusions @xcite ( see also @xcite for further analysis of the same data ) .",
    "more recently , the occurrence of power law distributions with non trivial exponents has attracted particular attention , because of an ongoing debate on whether the observed patterns are caused by a self - organized critical dynamics @xcite that would naturally lead to the notion of punctuated equilibrium @xcite . in this framework",
    "an ecosystem is depicted as a system of interacting species whose dynamics converges spontaneously close to a critical point @xcite : the extinction of a given species may trigger a cascade of extinction events starting from the species that depend upon , or directly interact with , the species just extinct and leading to fluctuations of any size in the number of extinction occurrences that may contiguously take place .    the aim of the present paper is to show that all the behaviors mentioned above for the lifetime distribution are captured by a simple model of non - interacting species .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that it may be problematic , if not inappropriate to discriminate between existing macroecological theories on the basis of existent datasets .",
    "the framework we adopt here is inspired by the ecological neutral theory proposed by hubbell @xcite and thereafter extended and analytically studied in @xcite .",
    "this class of models assumes that individuals in an ecological community are fully equivalent and the population of a species is essentially subject to a birth and death process .",
    "then , each species undergoes the same dynamics : the reproductive success of each individuals depends only on the species population size , and not on the particular species considered .",
    "competition among species is taken into account explicitly only via a constraint on the total population of the community and implicitly through averages birth and death rates .    from the point of view of evolutionary theory ,",
    "the hypothesis of species equivalence may be still justified by a red queen effect @xcite , which is able to forbid the acquisition of a large evolutionary advantage ( i.e. a significantly higher fitness level ) of a species over its competitors . in the framework of population dynamics , this hypothesis implies that demographic stochasticity is the main driving force for the assembly of ecological communities , meaning that its effect is overwhelmingly strong compared to that of fitness differences among species , which , although present , may be neglected .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that , in principle , complex ecological mechanism acting on long timescales are not ruled out by these stochastic models , as far as they can be included in effective birth and death rates .",
    "this consideration opens the issue of determining whether these theories are able to assess realistic predictions on large time and geographical scales , such as those relevant for the fossils observations .",
    "it is widely believed @xcite that statistical physics may provide the tools to bridge these very different scales . in this perspective , it is encouraging that conette _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite basing on the studies of the biodiversity time series compiled by sepkosky and coworkers @xcite , recently concluded that a random walk - like model is not inconsistent with the observed biodiversity time - patterns .",
    "the model we consider here is amenable to be analytically solved and is introduced in the next section .",
    "the resulting lifetime distribution interpolates , through a scaling function , between the behaviors of two well known stochastic processes : exit time problem for the one dimensional random walk @xcite and the critical galton - watson branching process @xcite . our results show that , even in a simple model in which interactions among species are included only in an averaged way , a variety of different behaviors for the distribution of extinction time is possible . in particular ,",
    "depending on the relevant time - scales , we find an exponential , or a power law behavior .",
    "the latter can either occur with exponent @xmath11 , typical of branching processes @xcite , or , for shorter time - scales , with a random walk like exponent @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , if we assume that the abundance of species is distributed according to a fisher log - series @xcite , in the galton - watson case , we find a power law distribution of extinction times with exponent @xmath12 .",
    "as we will discuss in the conclusion , these results stress the importance of time - scales and sampling effects in the analysis of lifetime distributions .",
    "this theory , also , can easily accommodate the contrasting empirical observations of refs .",
    "@xcite by assuming that , while species lifetimes probe the exponential regime of the theory , genera lifetimes fall in the power law range .",
    "the fact that power laws arise in an  effective  single - species theory , combined with the sparseness of available empirical data , suggests that it may not be possible to validate ( or discard ) ecological or evolutionary mechanisms like self - organized critical dynamics @xcite on the basis of an observed non - exponential behavior in the lifetime distributions .",
    "according to the assumption of neutrality @xcite , the dynamics of our model is uniquely specified by the effective birth and death rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 that depend exclusively on the population size @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 as `` effective '' because they may embody , in a cumulative way , a variety of ecological causes that may , in principle , influence the increase / decrease over time of the number of individuals in a species , or , more generally , in a given taxon .",
    "the framework is therefore ample enough to describe a population dynamics that is not simply dominated by demographic stochasticity , but also , for example , by immigration , emigration or niches assembly .",
    "we can safely assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the birth and death rates per individuals , can be expanded in a power series in @xmath18 around their asymptotic values @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21    the non - zero coefficient in this taylor series can be generally related to various kind of ecological effects giving advantages ( or disadvantages ) to a less abundant species with respect to a more abundant one . in hubbell s theory @xcite the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 maybe interpreted as the result of an immigration / emigration mechanism which couples the community to a meta - community living on a larger geographical scale .",
    "the mechanisms described by higher power in @xmath18 in eq.([bdexp ] ) are relevant only for small population sizes and they are unable , reasonably , to affect properties observed on large spatial scales and long timescales . in the following ,",
    "therefore , we will study the dynamics described only by the first two terms in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ bdexp ] ) : @xmath24 for all @xmath25 . despite the simple form of the birth and death rates , and the simplicity of the assumptions ,",
    "this class of models is able to provide very good fits of species abundance relation @xcite which can be related to the probability @xmath26 of having species with population @xmath15 .",
    "this probability , @xmath26 , evolves with time according to a birth and death master equation :    @xmath27    we impose @xmath28 , ensuring that the average number of individuals is finite and there is no `` demographic explosion '' .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 fixes , in - fact the average population per species @xcite .    in order to study the lifetime distribution",
    ", we consider an absorbing barrier at @xmath30 , imposing @xmath31 .",
    "the initial condition is that the new species at time @xmath32 has just one individual : @xmath33 making these assumptions , @xmath34 represents the probability of being already extinct at time @xmath35 and the lifetime probability distribution function ( or exit time distribution ) , @xmath36 , is just the time derivative of @xmath34 : @xmath37 we will first examine the two limit cases @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and then move to the general case .",
    "when @xmath38 the number of individuals belonging to a given species undergoes a random walk in @xmath15 space where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the probability per unit time to jump one step to the right ( left ) .",
    "a species lifetime would therefore correspond to the time it takes to the random walk to reach @xmath30 , i.e. to exit the positive axis .",
    "the problem of exit time distribution for a random walk process has been widely studied in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is well known that in the critical case @xmath40 the lifetime follow a distribution of the form @xmath41 .",
    "indeed it is easy to verify that the solution of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , in the present case , is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are modified bessel functions of integer order and the unit of time has been chosen such that @xmath44 . since for large @xmath45 , @xmath46 from eqs .",

    "this limiting case is interesting from an ecological point of view because the @xmath23 and @xmath22 terms happen to be small when one looks on a very large scale ( like on continental scale ) .",
    "the dynamics is equivalent to a galton - watson process in continuous time @xcite : the asymptotic behavior of the lifetime distribution is a classic result of the theory of critical branching processes @xcite .",
    "also in this case , the birth and death equation can be analytically solved : defining the characteristic function @xmath48 the birth and death equation can be transformed in a first - order p.d.e .",

    "the exact solution is : @xmath52    this distribution has an exponential - like shape when @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) is not too small . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath19 approaches @xmath20 , the distribution has a power law behavior with exponent @xmath11 and a characteristic timescale @xmath55 .",
    "the distribution @xmath36 can be casted in a more appealing form by using the language of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics . for large t and @xmath56 fixed , it follows , from eq .",

    "when dealing with observational data , an estimate of @xmath60 can be obtained by the ratio of two consecutive moments , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , of lifetime p.d.f . .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the role of the initial condition on the lifetime p.d.f .. taking into account an effective speciation rate , one can show , for the particular case at hand , that the resulting stationary distribution@xcite is the celebrated fisher log series @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a normalization constant . using the result above it is therefore possible to calculate the expected extinction time of a species that is chosen at random in the ecosystem . setting as initial conditions the characteristic function associated to the distribution ( [ fisherlog ] ) , @xmath66 ,",

    "heuristically , long - living species have typically a large number of individuals . for such species the @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms can be reasonably neglected .",

    "as sketched in the introduction , the fact that species lifetimes are usually exponentially distributed is often referred to as van valen s law @xcite : under the assumption that the fitness level is correlated in some way to the extinction probability , van valen states that an observed exponential lifetime distribution is the fingerprint of an acting red queen mechanism . later , more detailed analysis ( and datasets )",
    "@xcite brought to the observation of power - law behaviors in genera lifetimes , while species exponential lifetime distribution have been generally confirmed .",
    "this difference is , to a certain degree , counterintuitive as one would expect to see a deviation from criticality as a finite size effect when looking at long time scales .",
    "a possible explanation proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite is that at longer timescales , like those relevant for genera extinction , collective events like mass extinctions play a more important role .",
    "the interdependence of generic taxa in an ecosystem generates stronger correlations in their probability to survive , and these correlations , in turn , may originate a power - law behavior in the lifetime distribution @xcite .",
    "we have shown that also in a simple model , in which every species undergoes an effective _ independent _ dynamics , a critical behavior for the lifetimes may occur , with an exponent which is compatible with the observed value .",
    "this critical behavior is generated only by demographic stochasticity , which is known to be a very important factor in causing species extinction @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the hypothesis underlying this model are not so different to that bringing van valen to the explanation of the exponential species lifetime : our results clearly indicate that the presence of a red queen effect , i.e. the fitness equivalence of all species , do not ensure an exponential lifetime distribution , as far as one takes into account the population sizes in an explicit way . in some sense , in these models the population size acts as a simple `` memory '' of the evolutionary history of the species .",
    "it is worthwhile to connect our approach with a model proposed by raup @xcite as a null model for the survivorship curves of phanerozoic genera ( the lifetime distribution can be thought as the derivative of the survivorship curve ) .",
    "this model , fitting rather well the fossils data , assumes that species constituting the genera have a constant speciation and extinction rate .",
    "obviously , the resulting lifetimes distribution is the same that we recover as a limiting case of our model in eq.([gwet ] ) : the only difference is that , in raup s case , the branching - like dynamics is applied at the level of species ( not at the level of individuals ) .",
    "this implies that our model is well compatible with the data from the fossils record , with the advantage of being grounded on more realistic ( and testable ) hypothesis than the assumption of constant species immigration and speciation rates .    in our framework",
    ", it is also possible to explain why the critical behavior in the lifetimes is generally observed when studying higher taxonomic levels .",
    "let us assume that we can neglect the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as far as we are interested in the tail of the lifetime distribution . by taking the mean value of the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ fisherlog ] ) , the typical population size can be expressed as : @xmath103 the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ popsize ] ) diverges when @xmath104 : thus , a choice of the parameters closer to criticality implies a larger population size . since genera lump the individuals of may species ,",
    "the effective value of @xmath105 for a genera should be closer to @xmath106 than it is for species .",
    "therefore , it may not be possible to observe the power - law in the species lifetime due to the experimental error bars and the presence of the exponential cutoff occurring at @xmath107 according to eq.([gwet ] ) which , depending on its value , might mask both scaling regimes , i.e. @xmath0 and @xmath1 or only the latter .    finally , we demonstrated that , while local birth and death terms , i.e. terms that are negligible in the large population size limit , are known to modify the mean species extinction time @xcite , they are unable to affect the long timescale behavior of the lifetime distribution : the critical behavior of the distribution , in this class of models , is uniquely determined by the galton - watson part of the dynamics .",
    "given the robustness of this criticality with respect to modification of the dynamics on small scale , we suggest the hypothesis that the observed power law could be simply a consequence of the branching - like structure of single population dynamics , rather than an effect of the interactions among different species .",
    "in these notes we outline the main steps of the derivation of the results .",
    "let us firstly focus on the limit @xmath39 when the process reduces to a galton - watson branching process . without loss of generality , we can set @xmath50 and @xmath108 in what follows . introducing the characteristic function @xmath109 the birth and death equation can be transformed in a first - order p.d.e . for @xmath110 @xmath111",
