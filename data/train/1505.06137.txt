    "yield stress materials denote assemblies of mesoscopic constituents such as colloids , droplets or bubbles that display macroscopic properties intermediate between those of fluid and solid @xcite . at rest , or under low stresses ,",
    "yield stress materials display a solid - like behaviour whereas they flow like liquids above a certain threshold referred to as the yield stress @xcite .",
    "their solid - like behaviour at rest originates either from a densely packed microstructure composed of soft objects @xcite such as in dense emulsions @xcite , jammed microgels @xcite , etc . , or from the existence of weak attractive interactions that bind the constituents together and result in the formation of a sample - spanning network @xcite .",
    "in the latter case , solid - like properties emerge even at low packing fractions .",
    "this defines a category referred to as _ attractive gels _",
    "@xcite which encompasses various systems such as clay suspensions @xcite , carbon black gels @xcite and colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "all sorts of colloids and larger particles of different shapes and attraction potential also comply with this definition @xcite .    over the past ten years",
    ", the rheological behaviour of attractive gels has proved to be by far one of the most challenging to understand among non - newtonian fluids . in particular , their mechanical properties at rest",
    "are strongly time - dependent : attractive gels display a reversible aging dynamics driven by the weak attractive forces between its constituents @xcite and that can be reversed by shear . as a result , the gel elastic properties display a slow logarithmic or weak power - law increase with time @xcite , up to complete demixing of the system , which is historically referred to as syneresis @xcite .",
    "to make matter worse , particles are often denser than the surrounding fluid which fosters syneresis and may trigger the collapse of the gel @xcite .",
    "such density mismatch is further suspected to influence the behaviour of these systems under flow , although clear experimental evidence is still lacking @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is now well established that the behaviour of attractive gels under external shear involves heterogeneous flows that are highly sensitive to preshear history , boundary conditions , and/or finite size effects .",
    "for instance , one can emphasize the case of laponite suspensions which steady - state flow properties were shown to be influenced by the nature of the boundaries : under external shear , smooth walls lead to the complete fluidization of the gel and to linear velocity profiles , while rough boundary conditions allow the growth of a steady shear band @xcite .",
    "moreover , as an illustration of the impact of confinement on flows of attractive gels , one can mention the spectacular shear - induced structuration observed at moderate shear rates and reported in silica suspensions @xcite , gels of anisotropic particles @xcite , attractive emulsions @xcite and carbon black gels @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the gel rearranges to form a striped pattern of logrolling flocs aligned along the vorticity direction , which origin and formation mechanism are still highly debated @xcite .    beyond the effects of bounding walls and confinement , attractive interactions alone are also responsible for long - lasting transients under external shear .",
    "on the one hand , experiments performed under constant @xcite and oscillatory @xcite stress reveal that the fluidization process of attractive gels initially at rest , may take up to tens of hours .",
    "experiments coupled to velocimetry have revealed that such a process is mostly activated , as evidenced by the arrhenius - like dependence of the fluidization time with the applied shear stress @xcite , and that it is strongly heterogeneous in both the vorticity and the flow directions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "attractive gels show an overshoot in the stress response to shear startup experiments .",
    "such behaviour , which strongly depends on the preshear history , corresponds to the orientation and subsequent rupture of the gel microstructure into clusters @xcite . beyond the yield point ,",
    "attractive gels either display homogeneous or shear - banded flows depending on the applied shear rate and on the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "however , only a handful of studies have investigated the influence of the sample age , i.e. the duration separating preshear from the start of the experiment , on such shear - rate - induced fluidization scenario @xcite .",
    "recently , martin and hu have shown on laponite suspensions @xcite that aged - enough samples tend to exhibit long - lasting though transient shear - banding , and that shear - banding may also be trapped by the rapid aging of the non - flowing band and become permanent .",
    "the latter scenario is remarkable as it strongly differs from the classic shear - banding scheme which relies on the mechanical instability of the sample under scrutiny @xcite .",
    "this study highlights the interplay between the sample age and the shear and strongly urges to investigate the impact of sample age on the shear - induced fluidization scenario in other attractive gels .    to summarize , attractive gels neither entirely behave as solids nor as fluids over a wide range of timescales . in the landscape of non - newtonian fluids",
    ", they define a rather singular category of materials rightfully referred to as the  twilight zone \" in the early classification established by l.  bilmes @xcite , that was recently adapted to complex fluids by g.h .",
    "mckinley @xcite .",
    "we barely start to understand the ( transient ) rheology of attractive gels and more experiments are obviously needed to shed some light on the heterogeneous flows of such highly time - dependent materials .    in the present manuscript",
    "we report spatially resolved data on the fluidization dynamics of an attractive gel composed of weakly attractive non - brownian particles .",
    "velocimetry performed in a concentric cylinder geometry simultaneously to shear startup experiments reveals that the steady - state behaviour is a subtle function of both the time @xmath0 during which the system was left to age before the beginning of the experiment , and of the value @xmath1 of the applied shear rate .",
    "extensive experiments allow us to build a state diagram of steady - state flows in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) plane .",
    "two distinct regions roughly emerge : ( @xmath3 )  homogeneous flows for shear rates larger than a critical value @xmath2 that weakly increases with the aging time , and ( @xmath4 )  steady - state shear banding elsewhere . as a key result of this work , the complete fluidization observed in the upper region of the state diagram involves a transient shear band that is progressively eroded through a series of dramatic fluidization events .",
    "these avalanche - like processes show as large peaks in the temporal evolution of both the global shear stress and the slip velocity measured at the moving wall of the shear cell .",
    "as further confirmed by two - dimensional ultrasonic imaging , this fluidization process is spatially heterogeneous and may occur at different locations along the vorticity direction . finally , for a range of parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) in the vicinity of the boundary between the two main regions of the state diagram , we observe large fluctuations in the stress and slip velocity signals ,",
    "although the system does not reach complete fluidization .",
    "such avalanche - like events are strongly coupled to variations in both the width of the shear band and the slip velocity . the present work offers to our knowledge among the first experimental evidence of local avalanche - like fluidization events in a weak attractive gel under shear .",
    "it also provides an extensive data set to test the relevance of the flow stability criteria for shear banding @xcite and stands as a new challenge for spatially resolved models @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup allows us to perform time - resolved velocimetry simultaneously to standard rheometry .",
    "the rheological measurements are performed in a polished taylor - couette ( concentric cylinder ) cell made of plexiglas ( gap @xmath5  mm ) in which the inner mooney - couette cylinder of angle @xmath6 , height 60  mm and radius 23  mm is connected to a stress - controlled rheometer ( arg2 , ta instruments ) and positioned at @xmath7 m from the bottom of the outer cylinder . a solvent trap located at the top of the rotor and a homemade lid",
    "are used to prevent evaporation efficiently up to about 9  hours .",
    "the taylor - couette cell is embedded in a water tank connected to a thermal bath which allows us to keep the sample at a constant temperature @xmath8c .",
    "local velocity profiles across the gap of the taylor - couette cell are recorded simultaneously to the global rheology by means of two different ultrasonic probes immersed in the water tank , which also ensures acoustic coupling to the shear cell .",
    "the first ultrasonic probe is a single high - frequency focused transducer that allows us to record the azimuthal velocity @xmath9 as a function of the radial position @xmath10 across the gap at the middle height of the shear cell i.e. at 30  mm from the bottom .",
    "full technical details on this one - dimensional ultrasonic velocimetry ( 1d - usv ) technique can be found in a previous publication @xcite .",
    "the second ultrasonic probe consists of a linear array of 128 transducers placed vertically at about 15  mm from the cell bottom .",
    "this transducer array is 32  mm high and gives access to images of the azimuthal velocity as a function of the radial position @xmath10 and vertical position @xmath11 over about 50% of the cell height .",
    "this two - dimensional ultrasonic velocimetry ( 2d - usv ) technique is thoroughly described in ref .",
    "both devices can be used simultaneously and roughly face each other in the water tank , i.e. they are separated by an azimuthal angle of about @xmath12 . while the 1d - usv setup has the advantage of a better spatial resolution ( about 40  @xmath13 m against 100  @xmath13 m ) , only the 2d - usv setup allows us to detect and monitor the presence of flow heterogeneities along the vorticity direction .",
    "both velocimetry techniques require that the ultrasonic beam crossing the gap of the shear cell is backscattered either by the fluid microstructure itself or by acoustic tracers added during sample preparation when the system is acoustically transparent @xcite . here",

    "here , we add a much larger amount of salt ( 1.2  m ) to the colloidal suspension , which leads to an ion exchange where protons are replaced by sodium ions @xcite .",
    "the loss of hydrogen bonding between the colloids and the solvent triggers the fast and irreversible aggregation of the silica colloids through the formation of interparticle siloxane bonds @xcite , resulting in the formation of the non - brownian particles described above .",

    "a strong preshear of @xmath15  s@xmath16 applied during 2  min fully fluidizes the system , which quickly rebuilds once the preshear is stopped and subsequently shows pronounced aging .",
    "indeed , small amplitude oscillatory shear reveals that the elastic modulus @xmath26 becomes larger than the viscous modulus @xmath27 within about 20  s [ see fig .  1 in the esi ] and that @xmath26 further increases logarithmically over more than 2  h [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "such aging dynamics are reproducible for a given preshear protocol and lead to the formation of a solid - like gel .",
    "the latter shows an elastic modulus that is nearly frequency independent and a critical yield strain of about 7% that weakly depends on the sample age [ see figs .  2 and 3 in the esi ] .",

    "the fluid velocity is color coded in mm.s@xmath16.,width=325 ]    to get better insight on the avalanche - like fluidization scenario , we now focus on the single stress drop shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) .",
    "this event is extracted from a shear startup experiments performed at @xmath70  s@xmath16 for @xmath53  min and the steady - state flow corresponds to a fully fluidized sample [ inset of fig .  [ fig7](a ) ] .",
    "the velocity profiles recorded simultaneously with 1d - usv are plotted as a spatiotemporal diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) .",
    "quite surprisingly the one - dimensional flow profiles before and after the stress drop are very similar as they all show shear localization over about half the gap . by the time the stress reaches its maximum value , about 80% of the gap",
    "is sheared .",
    "then shear abruptly localizes again over about 1  mm close to the rotor at the beginning of the stress relaxation . therefore , although the strong fluctuations of @xmath64 observed before the stress peak appear to be correlated to those of @xmath71 , the drop of about 15% in the stress value can not be explained by these one - dimensional data in a straightforward manner .",
    "we emphasize that the 1d - usv measurements are performed at a given height of the taylor - couette cell so that they may reflect the evolution of global rheology only if the flow is homogeneous along the vorticity direction . as a matter of fact ,",
    "velocity profiles @xmath72 recorded simultaneously over the whole height of the taylor - couette cell through 2d - usv demonstrate that the flow is strongly heterogeneous in the vertical direction @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig7](c ) shows a spatiotemporal plot of the fluid velocity along the vertical axis @xmath11 at a fixed radial position @xmath66  mm close to the rotor ( see also movie  3 in the esi )",
    ". depending on the position along the @xmath11-axis , the material can simultaneously be either solid - like as evidenced by areas of very low velocities in fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) ( see for instance at the top of the region of interest for @xmath73  mm ) or fluid - like and flow at high velocities as observed for @xmath74 and @xmath75  mm . note that the 1d - usv measurements are performed at @xmath76  mm and are fully consistent with the 2d - usv data .",
    "our measurements further reveal that the particular avalanche - like event analyzed here only corresponds to partial fluidization : at the end of the stress drop , the flow is still heterogeneous , even though arrested regions for @xmath77  s has given way to flowing regions arranged in a vertically banded structure for @xmath78  s. in fact , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) shows that several subsequent stress drop events still have to take place before complete fluidization of the sample .    to test the existence of a local fluidization scenario that would be generic to all avalanche - like events , we analyze additional experiments in the full fluidization region of the state diagram at @xmath79 and 200  s@xmath16 .",
    "the temporal evolution of the shear stress is reported respectively in figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and [ fig9](a ) and the corresponding 2d - usv measurements @xmath65 are displayed as spatiotemporal diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig8](b ) and [ fig9](b ) for a radial position @xmath68  mm ( see also movies  4 and 5 in the esi ) . here again , the temporal evolution of the velocity field is strongly heterogeneous along the vertical direction in both experiments .",
    "furthermore , despite these two experiments are performed at comparable shear rates , the local fluidization scenario is strikingly different . in the shear startup experiment reported in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the lower part of the region of interest is fully fluidized after the first stress relaxation while the upper part of the sample necessitates two supplemental avalanches to in turn fully fluidize . on the other hand , the fluidization process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] starts from the upper part of the region of interest before extending to the lower part of the taylor - couette cell .",
    "here , each avalanche - like event involves large pieces of the sample with a typical vertical extension of about 5  mm [ see events marked by white dotted lines in fig .  [",
    "fig9](a ) ] . some of these events only show up in the stress response as very small peaks while their local signature is much more impressive ( see , e.g. , the event at @xmath80  s ) . for @xmath81 to 500  s , the sample even appears to fluidize , or at least to be set into motion , through regular steps occuring from top to bottom with a characteristic time of 1020  s. the experiments shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] allow us to conclude that the peaks in the stress signal may encompass very different local scenarios .",
    "since both experiments were performed with the same aging time @xmath46  min , these results illustrate the high sensitivity to `` initial conditions , '' i.e. to the possibly different arrangement of the heterogeneous microstructure after the aging process , and the subtle interplay between aging and shear banding with no systematic failure scenario along the cell height .",
    "on the one hand , we conclude from section  [ sampleprep ] that the gel under scrutiny displays a discontinuous yielding transition that is very similar to the one reported in other attractive gels @xcite .",
    "indeed , one observes that , when the initial condition is a completely fluidized state , applying a series of shear rates of decreasing values leads to the growth of a steady - state arrested band below a critical shear rate @xmath33 . the value of @xmath33 is inherent to the sample and results from the flow instability at low shear rates",
    "this is fully consistent with previous results on ludox gels .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the shear startup experiments reported in section  [ results ] and performed on the sample prepared in the solid state allow us to identify a second critical shear rate @xmath82 . for applied shear rates such as @xmath83 , the sample gets only partially fluidized and exhibits steady - state shear banding , while long - lasting yet transient shear banding",
    "is observed for @xmath84 .",
    "such a behaviour can be interpreted in the framework recently described by martin and hu on laponite samples @xcite . under an external shear ,",
    "the sample in the vicinity of the rotor that is in initially at rest gets fluidized , while the sample close to the stator remains at rest and keeps aging .",
    "depending on the intensity of the shear rate , such heterogeneous velocity profile may either be trapped by the sample aging and become permanent as observed below @xmath85 , or become homogeneous after a transient shear - banding regime which duration decreases for increasing values of @xmath1 .",
    "such an argument allows us to understand that @xmath85 will be sensitive to the gap size and to the cell geometry , which we have verified by performing identical shear startup experiments with different gap widths .",
    "these experiments show that @xmath2 decreases as the gap size is reduced [ see fig .  6 in the esi ] . therefore ,",
    "steady - state shear banding trapped by aging should be distinguished from shear banding resulting from intrinsic flow instability which should not depend on the geometry .",
    "finally , we have shown in section  [ pd ] that @xmath85 is a nonlinear function of the sample age @xmath0 , again in contrast with @xmath33 .    regarding the transient fluidization dynamics , our work unravels the existence of very characteristic peaks in the global rheological data .",
    "these peaks correspond to local avalanches associated with the abrupt fluidization of shear - banded velocity profiles .",
    "an avalanche proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , the sample ages as evidenced by the slow increase of the stress indicative of progressive consolidation , while the shear band remains roughly fixed .",
    "second , the sample suddenly fluidizes before localizing again , at least partially , while the stress drops and the shear rate increases .",
    "this scenario strikingly recalls the transient shear banding reported in laponite clay suspensions @xcite and fits well with the stability criterion recently proposed by fielding _",
    "_ @xcite . in practice",
    "though , the physical origin of the avalanche - like and successive stress relaxation events remains to be determined .",
    "aging is more pronounced in our system than in the attractive gels that have been studied previously @xcite as evidenced from the large values of @xmath86 after preshear [ see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] . therefore",
    ", syneresis driven by the aggregation and/or sedimentation of the colloidal flocs due to their density mismatch with the surrounding fluid could also play a role and interfere with the traditional picture of a competition between aging and shear rejuvenation @xcite .",
    "as syneresis is negligible in most of the colloidal gels that have been the topic of rheophysical studies so far , it could also explain why such stress oscillations have , to our knowledge , never been reported in the literature .",
    "an alternative explanation for the stress oscillations could be related to confinement .",
    "indeed , as the size distribution of the fused silica aggregates is wide and extends up to 100  @xmath13 m , the sample mesostructure most likely involves aggregates which size becomes comparable to that of the gap , at least for long enough rest durations @xmath0 . in this framework",
    ", stress oscillations would result from a competition between shear - induced structuration as described in the introduction and the strong aging of the sample .",
    "such an interpretation would also account for the stick - slip like motion of the fluidized band at the moving wall .",
    "nonetheless , despite systematic monitoring of the sample during shear startup experiments , no structuration or spatial pattern could be observed .",
    "moreover , supplemental shear startup experiments in narrower gaps show that for a given shear rate , stronger confinement leads to the disappearance of the stress oscillations and to homogeneous velocity profiles [ see fig .",
    "6 in the esi ] .",
    "this last result strongly suggests that confinement alone can not account for stress oscillations .",
    "finally , the present study has focused on experiments performed under smooth boundary conditions , revealing the presence of strong wall slip associated with heterogeneous , shear - banded flows while fully fluidized states show negligible wall slip . yet",
    "the roughness and/or chemical nature of the walls are known to have a crucial influence not only on rheological measurements but also on local flow both close to the walls and in the bulk @xcite .",
    "therefore the influence of boundary conditions on the complex fluidization scenario reported here appears as the next key question to address in future work . as a first step ,",
    "we report preliminary tests on the role of boundary conditions on the above results in the esi .",
    "the flow curve measured under `` rough '' boundary conditions in a sand - blasted plexiglas taylor - couette cell with typical roughness of 1  @xmath13 m ( to be compared to a few tens of nanometers for the `` smooth '' cell used so far ) shows a smaller , yet significant hysteresis [ see fig .  1(b ) in the esi ] as well as wall slip at low shear rates ( see fig .  5 in the esi ) .",
    "furthermore , one can see a strong difference between the velocity profiles recorded simultaneously to the flow curve respectively with the rough and smooth boundary conditions ( compare fig .  4 and 5 in the esi )",
    "although the surface roughness of the rough boundary does not match exactly the size of the microstructure .",
    "in particular the transient fluidization episode reported around 7  s@xmath16 with smooth boundary conditions [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and fig .  4 in the esi ]",
    "is absent with rough walls ( see fig .  5 in the esi ) .",
    "these preliminary results illustrate the strong impact of the boundary conditions and urge for systematic experiments so as to quantify the impact of the boundary conditions especially on the state diagram reported in fig .",
    "we have investigated the local scenario associated with the shear - induced fluidization of an attractive gel made of non - brownian particles . we have identified a critical shear rate @xmath2 that separates steady shear - banded flows from full fluidization and that exhibits a nonlinear dependence with sample age @xmath0 .",
    "this critical shear rate @xmath2 is much larger that the one signaling flow instability in experiments starting from fluidized states and depends on the shear cell geometry as well as possibly on the preshear intensity imposed prior to the shear startup experiment . as a key result",
    ", we have shown that for shear rates larger than @xmath2 , the fluidization of the sample involves successive local avalanche - like events that are heterogeneously distributed along the cell height and which dynamics is strongly coupled to both the slip behaviour at the wall and the width of the shear band .",
    "such avalanches appear in the stress signal as peaks , which individual properties are strongly reminiscent of stick - slip phenomena .",
    "future work will focus on the early stage of shear startup experiments , and in particular on the stress overshoot that occurs before the stress relaxation , as well as on the influence of the boundaries and confinement on the fluidization scenario .",

    "<S> extensive rheology coupled to ultrasonic velocimetry allows us to characterize the global stress response together with the local dynamics of the gel during shear startup experiments . in practice , after being rejuvenated by a preshear , the gel is left to age during a time @xmath0 before being submitted to a constant shear rate @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in detail the effects of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the fluidization dynamics and build a detailed state diagram of the gel response to shear startup flows . </S>",
    "<S> the gel may either display transient shear banding towards complete fluidization , or steady - state shear banding . in the former case , we unravel that the progressive fluidization occurs by successive steps that appear as peaks on the global stress relaxation signal . </S>",
    "<S> flow imaging reveals that the shear band grows up to complete fluidization of the material by sudden avalanche - like events which are distributed heterogeneously along the vorticity direction and correlated to large peaks in the slip velocity at the moving wall . </S>",
    "<S> these features are robust over a wide range of values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , although the very details of the fluidization scenario vary with @xmath1 . finally , the critical shear rate @xmath2 that separates steady - state shear - banding from steady - state homogeneous flow depends on the width on the shear cell and exhibits a nonlinear dependence with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our work brings about valuable experimental data on transient flows of attractive dispersions , highlighting the subtle interplay between shear , wall slip and aging which modeling constitutes a major challenge that has not been met yet . </S>"
