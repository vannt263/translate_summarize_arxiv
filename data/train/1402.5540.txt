    "information about the magnetic field direction is extracted from the relative amplitudes of the transient oscillation at the atomic ground state larmor frequency and its first harmonic .",
    "the proposed magnetometer setup ( fig.[figsetup ] ) is similar to the one used for our previous scalar magnetometer @xcite .",
    "the principle of operation of the magnetometer is based on the use of a sequence of two consecutive atom - light interaction intervals . during the first interval",
    "the total magnetic field component along the light propagation direction is canceled through the application of an additional magnetic field produced with a solenoid . during this interval",
    "the atomic sample becomes aligned by optical pumping .    in a second interval ,",
    "the applied field is turned off and the previously prepared atomic alignment evolves in the presence of the magnetic field to be measured .",
    "this evolution can be understood as a precession of the atomic alignment @xcite around the magnetic field vector .",

    "the coherent atomic evolution results in oscillations of the light transmission at the ground state larmor frequency @xmath2 and the first harmonic @xmath3 .",
    "the larmor frequency is related to the magnetic field modulus @xmath4 through the expression : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bohr magneton and @xmath7 is the ground - state hyperfine level land factor which is known with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the relative amplitude of the transient oscillations at @xmath2 and @xmath8 depends on the magnetic field vector direction and can be used to measure the magnetic field vector components as it is theoretically analyzed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we present a simplified theoretical treatment based on a model transition from a ground level with total angular momentum @xmath9 to an excited level with @xmath10 ( see inset in fig .",

    "we use the notation @xmath11 for the involved states where @xmath12 is the atomic level angular momentum and @xmath13 the magnetic quantum number .",

    "the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the atomic hamiltonian and @xmath16 is the energy difference between the excited and ground levels , @xmath17 is the magnetic hamiltonian where @xmath18 is the magnetic field and @xmath19 is the total angular momentum operator .",
    "the atom - light interaction is described by the term @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the light electric field and @xmath22 is the dipole moment operator .",
    "+ we assume that the system evolves due to the presence of a magnetic field and consider the interaction with the light field as a perturbation .",
    "the density matrix @xmath23 that describes the atomic state is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the atomic state at @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the evolution operator .",
    "we consider a laser beam propagating along the @xmath28 axis and polarized along the @xmath29 ( see fig.[figtheory]a ) . during the preparation interval the total magnetic field",
    "is canceled ( through the application of an auxiliary field ) and the atomic system is optically pumped to dark states . using @xmath29 as the quantization axis , the light field only couples the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in consequence",
    "the system is pumped into the initial state given by the density matrix @xmath32 representing the alignment of the system .",
    "after the preparation interval , the auxiliary magnetic field is turned off and the atoms evolve in the presence of the magnetic field to be measured ( fig.[figtheory]a ) . to simplify the calculation of the atomic system evolution it is convenient to describe the state of the system using a reference frame where the magnetic field direction corresponds to the quantization axis .",
    "this is achieved by two consecutive rotations around the @xmath29 and @xmath33 axis ( @xmath34 is obtained after rotation of the @xmath35 axis an angle @xmath36 around axis @xmath29 . see fig.[figtheory]a ) . in the rotated frame , the initial density matrix is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the product of the rotation operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "the ratio of the amplitude of the two oscillating terms directly relates to the angle @xmath45 :    @xmath46    the proposed magnetometer is based on the use of eq.[eq6 ] for the determination of the angle between the magnetic field vector and the light polarization direction . in the derivation of eq.[eq5",
    "] we have ignored the system relaxation due to ground state decoherence .",
    "it is assumed that the decoherence characteristic time is much longer than the larmor period . in consequence ,",
    "the magnetometer operation is limited to magnetic fields that are large enough to verify this assumption . +",
    "as expected , eq.[eq5 ] predicts that the transient response is zero for a magnetic field parallel to the light polarization direction ( @xmath47 ) since no precession occurs for an atomic alignment that is created parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "another singular configuration corresponds to the magnetic field perpendicular to the light polarization ( @xmath48 ) , in which case only the precession at @xmath49 is observed without the component at @xmath2 in consistency with eq.[eq6 ] .",
    "+ in order to apply eq.[eq6 ] to actual experiments it is convenient to use the alternative angular coordinates shown at fig.[figtheory].b best suited to experimental control ( @xmath50 measures the light polarization angle with the plane containing the magnetic field and the light wave vector , @xmath51 is the angle between the magnetic field and the light wave vector ) .",
    "eq.[eq6 ] can then be written as :    @xmath52     + the derivation of eqs.[eq6 ] and [ eq7 ] was done under the assumption that the initial state is a statistical mixture of coherent dark states @xmath53 and @xmath54 with no population in the @xmath30 state . in order to ensure the preparation of this initial atomic state ,",
    "a measurement procedure is described in the next section .    strictly speaking , eqs.[eq6 ] and [ eq7 ]",
    "were only derived for a @xmath55 transition . in the next section",
    "we describe a numerical simulation showing that it can also be applied to different transitions including the @xmath56 transition used in the experiment .",
    "+      the initially prepared atomic state is in principle dependent on the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , a specific procedure needs to be followed to ensure that the prepared state corresponds to the sate @xmath57 assumed in the theory .",
    "+ first , the light polarization must be rotated to a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath58 ) . in practice",
    "this can be done by rotating the light polarization to the direction that cancels the transient oscillation at the larmor frequency @xmath2 , only preserving the transient oscillation at @xmath8 .",
    "some information about the magnetic field direction is thus obtained since the plane containing the magnetic field vector and the light wave vector is identified .",
    "also , the modulus of the magnetic field can be measured using the procedure described in @xcite . at this stage , a perfect cancelation of the magnetic field during the state preparation interval via optical pumping is not essential . as discussed in @xcite , is sufficient to roughly cancel the magnetic field component along the light propagation to observe a large enough amplitude of the atomic signal .",
    "+ next , the light polarization is rotated an angle @xmath59 to the plane containing @xmath18 and @xmath60 . in this stage",
    "the magnetic field component along the light propagation direction @xmath1 must be canceled during the preparation interval using the external coil .",
    "to optimize this field cancelation the maximization of the transient signal amplitude is used as a criterium .",
    "once this cancelation is achieved , the total magnetic field during the preparation interval is parallel to the light polarization . in consequence",
    ", the laser light only induces @xmath61 transitions ( taking the light polarization as quantization axis , see fig .",
    "[ figtheory ] ) and the atomic system is pumped to a statistical mixture of the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 as was assumed in the derivation of eq.[eq6 ] .",
    "after the preparation interval , the current in the coil is turned off and the oscillatory transient observed . the magnetic field direction given by @xmath51",
    "is then determined with the help of eq.[eq7 ] using @xmath62 .",
    "+ equation [ eq7 ] does not allow the determination of the sign of the angle @xmath51 .",
    "the orientation of the field component @xmath63 perpendicular to the direction @xmath60 is not determined by this equation .",
    "however , the orientation of the field component @xmath1 is known since it is determined by the sign of the external field required to compensate such component during the preparation interval .",
    "if a priori knowledge of the sign of @xmath51 is not available , an additional measurement in the presence of an additional magnetic field perpendicular to light propagation ( produced by another coil ) can be used to determine this sign .",
