    "we observe a similar behavior in the slg sample , therefore , this effect has a generic nature and was also observed by others.@xcite note that these overshoots in the hall resistance only appears at high temperatures and is therefore not due to the ( partial ) splitting of the lowest landau level as observed in e.g.   ref .  .",

    "according to eq .",
    "( [ slope ] ) , an increase in the slope with increasing temperature corresponds to a decrease of the charge carrier concentration , which appears to be counter - intuitive .",
    "however , the plateaus remain visible up to the highest temperature measured , i.e. , the system remains quantized and the number of electrons and holes within one landau level is fixed . in the quantized regime ,",
    "the slope of the hall resistivity depends not only on the number of charge carriers at the cnp , but also the strength of localization , i.e.  the width of the plateaus closest to the cnp .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ slope ] ) can not be used to relate the slope to the number of charge carriers .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ 2carb ] ) , which predicts a @xmath49-behavior of the slope around the cnp when @xmath50 , anticipates such an overshoot .",
    "a similarly unexpected behavior for high temperature is observed in the resistance at high magnetic fields .",
    "[ figallr](c ) shows the resistivity of blg in the quantized regime as a function of the total charge carrier concentration for various temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the non - quantized regime , the resistivity exhibits a metal - like increase with temperature .",
    "as we will show in the following subsection , this peculiar transport properties in the quantized regime can be described in a simple dos model with localized and extended states where the temperature dependence of the resistivity is governed by a redistribution of charge carriers due to the thermal activation .",
    "the model used for our calculation starts with the quantized dos for graphene in magnetic field consists of separate gaussian - shaped landau levels ( lls ) as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ figdos ] .",
    "states in the middle of each ll are extended , and states are localized in the tails . for our simulations of the dos in blg",
    "shown below , we have used a constant width @xmath51  k for the higher landau levels and @xmath52  k for the zero - energy ll.@xcite landau levels above ( below ) the cnp , populated by electrons ( holes ) , have a degeneracy of @xmath53 .",
    "the zeroth ll with a degeneracy of @xmath53 for slg and @xmath54 for blg is populated by electrons and holes simultaneously , such that electron and hole conduction can be found both above and below the cnp .",
    "we can then calculate the conductivity , using the kubo - greenwood formalism,@xcite : @xmath55\\,\\mathrm{d}e\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the fermi distribution and @xmath57 is an energy dependent function containing the density of the extended states , the particle velocity and the scattering time .",

    "modeling @xmath59 by a superposition of gaussians with the above mentioned widths , the kubo - greenwood formula reproduces qualitatively the behavior of the experimental conductivity in graphene , but does not give a universal value of minimal conductivity.@xcite therefore , we normalized the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaxx ] ) such that , at zero temperature , @xmath60 at the cnp has the universal value of @xmath61 in accordance with the experimentally observed value .    similarly , we can determine the hall conductivity by summing up all extended states below the fermi level , smeared out by temperature : @xmath62\\,\\mathrm{d}e\\ ] ]    when introducing a localized dos , the calculated conductivity @xmath63 develops plateaus which are not at multiples of @xmath64,@xcite because the number of extended states within a ll is less than the total level degeneracy . in order to reproduce the correct number of occupied lls in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaxy ] ) , we have normalized the extended dos for each ll to the total number of extended states within it .    after calculating the conductivities",

    "they can be compared to the experimental curves , plotted as panels ( a ) and ( c ) of the figures .",
    "the calculated curves reproduce qualitatively the experimental results , and display a similar temperature dependence .",
