    "glassy systems of extremely diverse types exist in nature .",
    "they all share several common features like a very slow , non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the development of a full theoretical description of the glassy phase is one of the most important challenges in condensed matter physics .",
    "a variety of techniques , that range from scaling arguments to mean - field approaches have been , and are still used , with the aim of attempting a satisfactory description of the glassy properties .",
    "one of these techniques is due to thouless , anderson and palmer ( tap ) @xcite , who introduced an approach to classical disordered systems based on the study of a free - energy landscape .",
    "the key object is the legendre transform of the free - energy @xmath1 with respect to a number of order parameters that are sufficient to describe the transition and the different phases in the system .",
    "this function behaves as an effective potential whose minima represent different possible phases . in a classical fully - connected ising model only one order parameter",
    "is needed , the global magnetization @xmath2 .",
    "the two possible minima of @xmath3 correspond to the two possible states of positive and negative magnetization , @xmath4 .",
    "focusing on the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) mean - field model for spin - glasses , tap showed that _ all _ the local magnetizations @xmath5 , @xmath6 , have to be included in order to derive the relevant free - energy landscape .",
    "the extremization condition of the tap free - energy on the @xmath7s leads to the tap equations .",
    "it was soon after realized by bray and moore @xcite that the number of solutions to the tap equations for the sk model is exponential in the number of spins in the system , for temperatures below the spin - glass transition @xcite .",
    "a very useful alternative derivation of the tap equations was given by plefka @xcite who showed that these equations can also be obtained from a power expansion of the gibbs potential up to second order in the exchange couplings .",
    "the advantage of this derivation is twofold : it allows to show convergence of the power expansion for all temperatures and it is easily applicable to other mean - field glassy models .",
    "moreover , georges and yedidia @xcite showed that the high temperature series , at fixed order parameter , of the free - energy can be used to derive tap - like equations , and its corrections , for models in finite dimensions or , equivalently , with finite range interactions .",
    "the connection between the tap approach and the more standard analysis of the partition function of a disordered model has been exhibited by de dominicis and young @xcite who showed that , for the sk model , one recovers the equilibrium results of the replica or the cavity method @xcite via weighted boltzmann averages over solutions of the tap equations .",
    "more recently , the tap approach has been applied to other classical disordered models . in particular , two models that we shall discuss in the following , the spherical and ising @xmath0 spin - glass models @xcite and",
    "the ghatak - sherrington ( gs ) model @xcite have been analyzed with this method @xcite .",
    "glassy systems , and in particular disordered ones , are characterized by having a very slow dynamics with non equilibrium effects at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "mean - field models , like the the spherical @xmath0 spin - glass model @xcite or the sk spin - glass @xcite , capture this phenomenology . the dynamic solution for the evolution starting from random initial conditions , that represent a quench from high temperatures analytically , is intimately connected to the structure and organization of tap solutions .",
    "one of the most striking results of the dynamic analysis of @xmath0 spin - glass - like models is that the energy density ( and other one time - quantities ) converges asymptotically to the energy density of high lying solutions of the tap equations . this level has been called _",
    "threshold_. the energy - density in equilibrium is different .",
    "this and other related results suggest that an interpretation of the dynamics in terms of a motion in a tap free - energy landscape can be given @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the tap approach to dynamics that has been developed in @xcite allows one to make this statement precise : the evolution is determined by a gradient - descent in the tap free - energy landscape with the most important addition of non - markovian terms .",
    "usually , glasses can be analyzed with a fully classical approach since their transition temperatures are rather high .",
    "nevertheless , in many cases of great interest the critical temperature can be lowered by tuning another external parameter and quantum fluctuations become very important .",
    "this is the case for the insulating magnetic compound liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 , that is an experimental realization of a quantum spin - glass , and presently receives much attention @xcite .",
    "other examples where glassy properties in the presence of quantum fluctuations have been observed are mixed hydrogen bonded ferro - antiferro electric crystals @xcite , interacting electron systems @xcite , cuprates like la@xmath11sr@xmath8cuo@xmath10 @xcite , amorphous insulators @xcite , etc .    the quantum fluctuations in liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 can be controlled by tuning the strength of an external field that is transverse to the preferred direction of the randomly located magnetic impurities . after a series of experiments presented in @xcite the authors conclusions are : ( 1 )",
    "the samples undergo a paramagnetic to spin - glass transition in the @xmath12 plane , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the strength of the transverse field .",
    "( 2 ) the transition is of second order ( in the thermodynamic sense ) close to the classical critical point @xmath15 but crosses over to first order close to the quantum critical point @xmath16 .",
    "( 3 ) the system undergoes out of equilibrium dynamics in the glassy phase as demonstrated by the fact that the dynamics strongly depends on the preparation of the sample for all subsequent times explored experimentally .",
    "the theoretical study of quantum spin - glasses started with bray and moore s analysis of the equilibrium properties of the fully connected heisenberg model @xcite . in this article ,",
    "bray and moore introduced a path - integral representation in imaginary time of the partition function that they analyzed with the replica trick .",
    "many articles on the equilibrium of this , and related , mean - field models have been published since @xcite .",
    "the static properties of low dimensional models have been studied and it has been shown that , in finite dimensions , griffiths - mccoy singularities are very important close to the quantum critical point @xcite . in all these models ,",
    "the transition from the paramagnetic to the spin - glass phase has been reported to be of second order throughout .    in most classical disordered models studied so far the transition from the disordered to the ordered phase",
    "is of second order in the thermodynamic sense . in the exact solution of the sk model ,",
    "the spin - glass order parameter @xmath17 is continuous at the transition which is of second order in the thermodynamic sense @xcite . in other classical glassy models like the potts glass @xcite or the spherical @xcite and ising @xcite @xmath0 spin - glasses ,",
    "the order parameter jumps at the transition which , however , is still of second - order in the thermodynamic sense since there is neither a jump in the susceptibility nor a latent heat .",
    "a classical model that exhibits a first - order transition is the anisotropic @xmath0 spin - glass , @xmath18 , in which the spins take integer values between @xmath19 and @xmath20 and there is an extra term in the hamiltonian @xmath21 , proportional to a coupling constant @xmath22 , that controls the crystalline tendency . in this case , a crossover from a second - order to a first - order thermodynamic transition in the plane @xmath23 has been exhibited in the exact solution @xcite .",
    "the classical ghatak - sherrington ( gs ) model @xcite is another candidate to exhibit a second to first order crossover in the thermodynamic transition .",
    "it is the anisotropic extension of the sk model , or the @xmath24 limit of the previous model . in this case ,",
    "a crossover from a second order to a first order transition in the plane @xmath23 has been exhibited in an _ approximate _ solution ( one step replica symmetry breaking ) @xcite .",
    "the exact solution has not been derived yet and it is then not well established if it has a true first - order thermodynamic transition .    in quantum problems ,",
    "first order transitions have been reported in three models .",
    "the first one is the so - called `` fermionic ising spin - glass '' analyzed by oppermann and collaborators @xcite .",
    "this model , however , is thermodynamically equivalent to the classical gs model discussed above @xcite .",
    "the other two models are very similar indeed and they are different ways of extending the classical spherical @xmath0 spin - glass model @xcite to include quantum fluctuations . in one case ,",
    "the continuous spins are generalized to @xmath25 component vectors and a global spherical constraint as well as commutation relations are imposed @xcite .",
    "the other one uses the fact that the spherical @xmath0 spin - glass model can be interpreted as a particle moving in an infinite dimensional hyper - sphere with a random potential .",
    "quantization is then done by imposing commutation relations between coordinates and momenta @xcite .",
    "the latter can also be interpreted as an extension of the a quantum rotor model @xcite that includes @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the relation between the critical properties of the quantum versions of @xmath0 spin - glass models and the experiments in @xcite has been put forward in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the connection between the static calculation supplemented by the marginality condition and the analysis of the out of equilibrium dynamics in contact with an environment developed in @xcite was also discussed in @xcite . however , the reason why the transition changes from second to first order close to the quantum critical point was not clear from this analysis .",
    "it is one of the aims of this article to clarify this point , and study to what extent one can claim it to be general , with the use of the tap approach .",
    "quantum tap equations for the sk model in a transverse field have been presented by ishii and yamamoto @xcite and cesare _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the former use a perturbative expansion of the free - energy in the strength of the transverse field , and then follow closely tap s techniques ; the latter implement a cavity method .",
    "the tap equations derived by rehker and oppermann @xcite for the fermionic spin - glass model coincide with the ones presented by yokota @xcite for the classical gs model since these two models are thermodynamically equivalent @xcite .    hence , our aim is twofold . on the one hand",
    "we want to present a quantum extension of the tap approach to the statistical properties of disordered systems .",
    "thus , after a short revision of the classical tap approach in section [ introtap ] , we discuss in section [ sec1:formalism ] the derivation of the quantum tap free - energy and tap equations using a general approach that extends the ones developed by plefka @xcite and georges and yedidia @xcite .",
    "the advantage with respect to previous derivations of quantum tap equations is that this method can be applied to any quantum disordered model and it allows to obtain the tap equations as well as the tap free energy . in section  [ p - spin ]",
    "we present , as an example , the tap free - energy and tap - equations for the quantum extension of the @xmath0 spin spherical spin - glass model studied in @xcite .",
    "we show that the tap equations can be easily related to the equations for the order parameter in the matsubara replica approach and also to some of the equations appearing in the real - time dynamic approach .",
    "the tap analysis of this model furnishes a benchmark to study the generalization to the quantum case of the methods and interpretations developed for classical systems .",
    "section  [ transition ] is devoted to the second aim of this article . via the tap approach",
    "we show that the same type of phase diagram naturally emerges for all systems having a discontinuous phase transition in their classical limit ( these are models solved by a one - step replica symmetry breaking ansatz within the replica analysis ) .",
    "in particular we relate the first - order transition close to the quantum critical point to the structure of metastable states .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "in this section we present a short revision of the classical tap approach to mean - field disordered spin models .",
    "the classical tap free - energy @xcite is the legendre transform of the free - energy with respect to local magnetic fields , @xmath26 where @xmath27 are lagrange parameters enforcing the condition @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is an effective potential that depends on the local magnetizations .",
    "the lagrange conditions @xmath30 , called tap equations , fix the local magnetizations as functions of the local magnetic fields .",
    "the solutions @xmath31 of the tap equations are stationary points of @xmath32 .",
    "if they are also stable ( all the corresponding eigenvalues of the free - energy hessian are positive ) , they are identified @xcite with pure states , also called tap states .",
    "this interpretation was put forward by de dominicis and young @xcite who showed that the partition function in the classical sk model can be written as a weighted sum over the stable solutions of the tap equations : @xmath33 where the index @xmath34 labels different tap states , @xmath35 is an @xmath36-vector encoding the local magnetization in the solution @xmath34 , @xmath37 is the extensive tap free - energy of such solution and the sum runs over all tap solutions .",
    "consequently , the static average of any observable can be computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : weighted ] ) . at low temperatures the tap free - energy has a large number of minima .",
    "if one groups different tap states with the same free - energy in sets @xmath38 then the partition function can be written as @xmath39 where the factor @xmath40 is the number of solutions with tap free - energy density @xmath41 .",
    "one can now replace the sum by an integral and exponentiate the factor @xmath40 ; this yields @xmath42 where we have taken the continuous limit and introduced the _ complexity _",
    "@xmath43 the configurations that dominate the sum are those having a free - energy density such that it minimizes @xmath44 .",
    "the identity between the partition function and the weighted sum over tap solutions has been demonstrated for many others models @xcite and it is generally believed to hold for any mean - field disordered system .    in the following we focus on `` discontinuous glassy systems '' @xcite that are characterized by having a discontinuous transition ( the edwards - anderson order parameter , @xmath45 , jumps ) that is still of second order thermodynamically . within the replica analysis of the partition function these models are characterized by a one - step replica symmetry breaking solution below a static transition temperature @xmath46 and a replica symmetric ( rs ) solution , that corresponds to the paramagnetic phase , at @xmath47 .",
    "however , for intermediate temperatures @xmath48 there are an exponential in @xmath36 number of non - trivial tap solutions that combine themselves in such a way that the sum ( [ eq : weighted3 ] ) is identical to the rs result .    the relationship between metastable states and replicas has been put forward in @xcite . indeed , consider @xmath49 different identical systems ( `` clones '' ) coupled by an attractive , infinitesimal ( but extensive ) interaction .",
    "when there exist many pure states all the clones fall into the same state and the free energy for the system of @xmath49 clones reads : @xmath50 on the other hand the computation of the left hand - side of ( [ reltaprep0 ] ) can be performed within the replica formalism : @xmath51 where the overline represents the average over disorder .",
    "since the attractive coupling between the @xmath49 clones is infinitesimal , the computation of the right - hand side of ( [ reltaprep1 ] ) reduces simply to the calculation of @xmath52 , where the replica symmetry between the @xmath53 groups of @xmath49-replicas ( @xmath54 ) is _ explicitly _ broken .",
    "when the system is in the replica symmetric phase ( @xmath55 ) , this reduces to study one - step solutions non - optimized with respect to @xmath49 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the free - energy computed by using replicas , @xmath45 is the edwards - anderson parameter and @xmath49 is the breakpoint ( or the size of the blocks in the replica matrix ) . for simplicity",
    "we consider that the inter - state overlap @xmath58 equals zero .",
    "the definitions of these parameters are standard in the replica approach @xcite and they will appear in the analysis of the quantum @xmath0 spin - glass model in section  3 . since the integral on the left - hand - side of ( [ reltaprep ] ) is dominated by a saddle point contribution , one finds that , for a given temperature , fixing the value of @xmath49 is equivalent to summing over states with a given energy density @xmath59 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath59 and @xmath49 reads @xmath60 note that within this framework one does not have to optimize with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "instead , @xmath49 is a free parameter and , by changing the value of @xmath49 , one can consider different groups of metastable states .",
    "the analysis of the tap equations reveals three temperature regimes for discontinuous glassy systems :    * _ high temperatures _",
    "the system is in the paramagnetic phase , the paramagnetic tap solution @xmath62 , for all @xmath63 , dominates the sum and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is the dynamic critical temperature .",
    "above @xmath65 the dynamics starting from a random initial condition converges asymptotically to the paramagnetic solution . * _ intermediate temperatures _",
    "the replica analysis of the partition function indicates that the system is still in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "however , the study of the tap equations and the dynamics show that at @xmath65 the paramagnetic solution is fractured in an exponentially large in @xmath36 number of minima of the tap free - energy @xcite .",
    "indeed one can recover these results also by the replica method .",
    "a careful replica analysis shows that there exist one - step solutions in these temperature regime other than the paramagnetic one .",
    "these solutions are in one to one correspondence with groups of states with a given free - energy density ( through the relationship ( [ rela : xf ] ) ) . for instance",
    ", one can follow the evolution of the threshold states ( the states with highest free - energy ) by tuning the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "for these states , @xmath67 when @xmath68 and decreases at lower temperatures . moreover , the dominant contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : weighted3 ] ) is given by the states characterized by @xmath67 , _",

    "hence , between @xmath71 saddle - point solutions ( corresponding to @xmath67 ) that are not absolute minima of @xmath37 dominate the integral since their number scales exponentially with @xmath36 .",
    "the final result for the free - energy density in this temperature range coincides with the one of the prolongation of the paramagnetic solution ( that actually does not exist ! ) .",
    "a naive replica computation fails to signal the difference between a true paramagnetic solution and the ensemble of non trivial tap solutions with @xmath72 .",
    "the dynamic approach detects the change in free - energy landscape at @xmath65 since the system can not reach equilibrium for any temperature below @xmath65 @xcite . *",
    "_ low temperatures _ @xmath73 . at the static transition temperature the complexity of the tap solutions , which dominates the sum ( [ eq : weighted3 ] ) , vanishes",
    "the static transition appears as an _ entropy crisis _ since the part of the total entropy that is related to the large number of states disappears . for @xmath74 the tap states which dominate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weighted3 ] ) correspond to the equilibrium glassy phase .",
    "dynamically , @xmath46 does not play any role .",
    "the out of equilibrium dynamics is dominated by the threshold states , which are the highest ones in free - energy and that are characterized by flat directions in the free - energy landscape .",
    "note that via the tap approach one can obtain a reasonable justification of the marginality condition @xcite often used to obtain information about the out of equilibrium dynamics starting from a pure equilibrium computation  @xcite .",
    "indeed the value of @xmath49 fixed by the marginality condition corresponds to the tap states which are marginally stable ( the threshold states ) : the flatness of the free - energy landscape around these states is responsible for aging @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a simple procedure to derive tap equations for generic completely connected quantum systems .",
    "we also expose the physical meaning of quantum tap equations by the cavity method @xcite .",
    "we are aware of two publications where tap equations for quantum systems have been already presented @xcite . with respect to these",

    "the transition is of second order even if the order parameter jumps discontinuously .",
    "this peculiar behavior is due to the fact that near the transition the paramagnetic state is fractured into an exponential number of states which continuously become the ones responsible for the glassy phase at low temperature .",
    "this is not possible at zero temperature ( the quantum paramagnet is not formed by a collection of glassy states ) and therefore it is reasonable to expect a quantum first order phase transition between the glass phase and the quantum paramagnet . increases and vanish exactly at @xmath261 . in this case",

    "moreover , since for @xmath281 the right hand side of ( [ eqq1final ] ) is positive then we obtain that @xmath282 and @xmath283 are positive and using that @xmath284 and imposing that ( [ c(0)-stab ] ) has to be negative , we obtain : @xmath285 but this is impossible for @xmath278 , i.e. it is not possible to have a consistent stable @xmath286 solution .      in this appendix",
    "we give an argument in favor of the relation @xmath287 in eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) .",
    "let us start by assuming that it does hold and see that it leads to the equation linking @xmath49 , @xmath45 and @xmath187 in the matsubara approach .",
    "first of all we write the derivative of @xmath248 with respect to @xmath59 as a derivative with respect to @xmath246 .",
    "this can be easily done by noticing that differentiating @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) with respect to @xmath246 at @xmath288 and @xmath149 fixed is equivalent to differentiating @xmath59 with respect to @xmath246 at @xmath289 and @xmath290 fixed because @xmath59 is stationary in @xmath291 and @xmath290 . as a consequence we find @xmath292 the derivative @xmath293 can be easily computed from eq .",
    "( [ complexity ] ) .",
    "one arrives at @xmath294 in summary , starting from the tap approach at fixed @xmath158 we obtain @xmath45 and @xmath187 . assuming then that eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) holds we obtain the equation linking @xmath45 and @xmath49 in the matsubara approach .",
    "the equations for @xmath187 in the tap and matsubara approaches , once @xmath45 is fixed , are identical .",
    "hence we have proven that eq .",
