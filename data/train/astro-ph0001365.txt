    "stresses in the crust of a neutron star could produce starquakes that affect the star s spin evolution and generate high - energy emission .",
    "as the star s spin rate increases or decreases , changes in the equilibrium shape of the star and the differential rotation between the crust and the interior neutron superfluid generate stress @xcite . in `` magnetars '' , decay of the superstrong field ( @xmath0 g ) could break the crust and drive episodes of intense gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "recent studies showed that starquakes can change the magnetic spin - down torque acting on the star @xcite .",
    "starquakes in slowing neutron stars drive matter toward the magnetic poles , distort the star s shape , and excite precession .",
    "as the precession damps , the star relaxes to a new rotational state with the magnetic poles closer to the equator .",
    "the new magnetic orientation enhances the braking torque on the star and may provide an explanation for the observed increases in the spin - down torque following glitches in the crab pulsar , psr1830 - 08 and psr0355 + 54 .    here",
    "we investigate the physical processes that allow the star to relax to its post - starquake equilibrium .",
    "the most important processes are the coupling between the liquid core and solid crust and the creep of neutron superfluid vortices in the inner crust of the star .",
    "we find that the changes produced by large starquakes can trigger catastrophic unpinning of neutron superfluid vortex lines in the star s inner crust @xcite .",
    "as vortices move , the inner crust superfluid rapidly settles to a state of lower angular momentum , while exerting a spin - up torque on the crust .",
    "our estimates show that starquake - triggered events may explain giant pulsar glitches as well as the persistent spin - down offsets .",
    "the next section summarizes earlier work on starquakes and spin - down offsets , and the following one describes the post - starquake spin relaxation and glitches .",
    "the crust of a spinning neutron star is oblate with an equatorial bulge .",
    "the moment of inertia of the bulge is @xmath1 where @xmath2 cm is the stellar radius , @xmath3 rad s@xmath4 is the star s spin frequency , and @xmath5 is the characteristic moment of inertia of the crust .",
    "the crust contains about 1% of the star s total moment of inertia @xmath6 . as the star spins down , the equatorial circumference shrinks and the polar radius grows .",
    "because the crust is solid , strain develops as the star s shape changes . as sketched in figure 1 , the strain in the crust is relieved along starquake faults that form at an angle to the star s equator @xcite .",
    "matter slides along these faults to higher latitudes , and magnetic stresses favor those faults that direct matter along field lines toward the magnetic poles .",
    "an important result of the earlier studies is that starquakes shift the stellar matter asymmetrically , creating excess moment of inertia @xmath7 about an axis different from any of the pre - starquake principal axes .",
    "this distortion changes the orientation of the principal inertial axis by an angle @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the _ distortion parameter _",
    "@xmath10 characterizes the size of the starquake .    when the principal axis of inertia of the crust is not aligned with the star s angular momentum , the star precesses and wobbles .",
    "eventually the star relaxes to a new equilibrium in which the axis and angular momentum are again realigned , and the magnetic pole is shifted by the angle @xmath11 closer to the rotational equator . in some mechanisms for pulsar spin down , such as the magnetic dipole braking model , this angular shift increases the torque on the star , producing a long - lasting increase in the spin - down rate .",
    "the persistent spin - down offsets observed in the crab pulsar can be explained by this mechanism if @xmath12 @xcite corresponding to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 for the crab pulsar ) .",
    "starquake - induced asymmetry in the stellar crust excites precession .",
    "if the neutron star crust behaved as an isolated rigid body , it would precess or wobble at a frequency @xmath15 and the angle between the angular velocity and the angular momentum would be @xmath16 . the spin behavior of a realistic neutron star is more complicated than this for several reasons .",
    "first , the pinning of superfluid vortices in the inner crust acts to stabilize the spin of the crust .",
    "second , the crust and core of the star are not strongly coupled on the precession time scale .",
    "third , the tilting of the crust accelerates vortex creep .    * pinned superfluid . * in the inner crust of the star the neutron superfluid vortex lines may pin to the nuclei in the solid crust .",
    "the rotation of the superfluid is determined by the location of the vortex lines , and , as long as the vortex lines remained pinned , the superfluid velocity field can not change . the gyroscopic action of the pinned superfluid works with the equatorial bulge to further stabilize the star @xcite .",
    "the moment of inertia @xmath17 of the pinned superfluid is comparable to that of the crust and much larger than the moment of inertia of the equatorial bulge ; @xmath18 .",
    "the pinned superfluid decreases the equilibrium tilt of the star by a factor @xmath19 to an angle @xmath20 .",
    "this is the tilt angle of the star with completely pinned superfluid _ after the precession has damped _",
    "( the tilt immediately after the starquake is @xmath21}^2 \\sim 10^{-10 } \\delta_{-7}^2 $ ] ) .",
    "the precession frequency is proportional to @xmath22 and inversely proportional to moment of inertia coupled to the crust .",
    "if the spin of the core and the crust are tightly coupled , the star s precession frequency is @xmath23 rad s@xmath4 .",
    "* coupling between the crust and the core . *",
    "changes in the crust s motion are communicated to the core by mhd - like waves .",
    "if the protons in the neutron star core form a type ii superconductor , as expected , the magnetic field is confined to thin tubes of flux @xmath24 g @xmath25 , with characteristic dimensions @xmath26 fm and field strengths @xmath27 g. signals travel from the crust to the core on an alfvn time @xmath28 s , for an average field of @xmath29 g and a density of @xmath30 g @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "because of the imperfect coupling between the crust and the core , the precession is damped on a time scale @xcite @xmath32 the energy of the regular motion of precession is converted into irregular fluid motions in the core .",
    "the irregular motions of the superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons are then converted into thermal energy by processes such as electron scattering from vortex lines @xcite or flux tube - vortex line interactions @xcite .",
    "since the core and crust are not strongly coupled on the precession time scale , the effective moment of inertia of the precessing material is less , and the precession frequency may be higher than we have used . the damping time scale would be correspondingly reduced .",
    "after the precession has damped , the star s crust has tilted by @xmath33 . as the pinned vortex lines move to align with the crust s rotation vector , the tilt angle grows until it equals @xmath34 we now examine the processes by which the vortex lines move and the effects of this motion on the star s spin behavior .",
    "* motion of vortex lines . * in a steady state , the angular velocity of the superfluid closely follows that of the solid crust . as the superfluid rotation slows , the vortex lines move radially with a steady velocity @xmath35 , where the spin - down age of the pulsar is @xmath36 @xcite . for the crab pulsar @xmath37 cm s@xmath4 and for the vela pulsar @xmath38 cm s@xmath4 .",
    "if the vortex lines move at @xmath39 following a starquake , they would align with the new direction of the crust s principal axis in a time @xmath40 , years for the crab pulsar and decades for the vela pulsar .",
    "the vortex velocity can be greatly enhanced by the perturbations produced by the tilt of the spin axis .",
    "after the star s spin axis tilts relative to the pre - starquake orientation , some parts of the star are further from the new spin axis ; this shift can be as large as @xmath41 . for these regions , the linear velocity from the star s spin increases by @xmath42 .",
    "the superfluid velocity , on the other hand , changes much less .",
    "if the neutron vortex lines in the star vortex were completely pinned , the superfluid velocity in the star s frame would remain unchanged .",
    "even though the superfluid in the core is not pinned , the vortex lines can not move through the crust , so the crust superfluid velocity remains fixed .",
    "the velocity lag @xmath43 between the superfluid and the solid crust thus changes by as much as @xmath44 in parts of the star ; see figure 2 .",
    "velocity differences of this magnitude may have dramatic effects on the vortex velocity , large enough to produce the crustal spin - ups associated with glitches",
    ".    pinned vortex lines in the inner crust can creep outward through thermal activation of vortex segments from their pinning barrier ; a line segment unpins from one configuration and migrates to new sites where it repins @xcite .",
    "the general form of the creep velocity is @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the minimum activation energy for a segment of the vortex line to unpin @xcite .",
    "the activation energy depends sensitively on the lag velocity @xmath43 .",
    "if the vortex lines are moving at their steady state rate @xmath39 and the lag velocity suddenly jumps by @xmath47 , the new creep rate is @xmath48 .\\ ] ] the activation energy of a vortex line is characterized by the maximum pinning force @xmath49 between a nucleus and a vortex line , the range of the pinning force @xmath50 and the distance between pinning sites @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum lag velocity between the superfluid and the crust that the pinning forces can support is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 @xmath54 s@xmath4 and @xmath55 is the mass density of the neutron superfluid ; @xmath56 g @xmath31 is the characteristic density of much of the inner crust superfluid .",
    "the activation energy required for a vortex line to unpin depends on the stiffness of the vortex line ; if the line is flexible , it can unpin from one nucleus at a time , whereas if it is stiff , the line must unpin from many nuclei simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 characterizes the vortex line s stiffness @xcite ; for the conditions in much of the crusts of the crab and vela pulsars @xmath58 and vortex lines move by unpinning from many sites simultaneously . in this limit",
    "the appropriate expression for the activation energy is @xmath59 and it s derivative is @xmath60 in obtaining this equation we set @xmath61 , which is a characteristic value for a variety of stellar models @xcite .",
    "we can use the observations of the vela pulsar to estimate @xmath62 .",
    "this pulsar exhibited a string of 12 nearly evenly spaced glitches separated with an average interval of @xmath63 years @xcite .",
    "the regularity of these glitches suggests that the inner crust superfluid remains pinned between glitches until the velocity lag between the solid crust and the superfluid approaches @xmath64 . with this interpretation , a lower limit to the critical lag velocity",
    "is @xmath65 cm s@xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath62 exceeds this limit because the inner crust superfluid might not relax to zero lag velocity at each glitch . for our estimates",
    "we use @xmath66 cm s@xmath4 . for @xmath67",
    "the pinning force is @xmath68 kev fm@xmath4 at a superfluid density of @xmath70 g @xmath31 .",
    "this pinning force is much smaller than that obtained by recent microscopic calculations of vortex - nuclear interactions @xcite assuming a perfect crystal , but it is larger than the average pining force estimated for an amorphous crust @xcite .    taking @xmath70 g @xmath31 and interaction distance",
    "@xmath71 fm @xcite , the change in the activation energy in parts of the crust after a starquake is @xmath72    the time scale for the post - starquake relaxation of the vortex lines is @xmath73 ; for @xmath74 in kev , this gives @xmath75 .\\ ] ] the vortex relaxation time is very sensitive to the magnitude of the quake - induced shape change .",
    "for example , taking @xmath76 , we find that for the crab pulsar ( @xmath77 kev , @xmath78 yr , @xmath79 ) the relaxation time is less than the damping time if the distortion parameter is @xmath80 , but it is more than @xmath81 if @xmath82 . the corresponding values for the distortion parameter for the vela pulsar ( @xmath83 kev , @xmath84",
    "yr , @xmath85 ) are @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for each pulsar",
    ", there is a critical value for the distortion parameter @xmath10 .",
    "starquakes that produce distortions above this threshold trigger rapid vortex motions while smaller events generate only gradual changes .",
    "* spin jumps .",
    "* in the large events , the rapid outward motion of the vortex lines produces a slowing of the superfluid and a corresponding spin up of the crust . in the regions of the inner crust where @xmath47 is positive the vortex lines rapidly creep a distance @xmath88 .",
    "the superfluid in the affected regions of the inner crust will now spin more slowly by corresponding amount : @xmath89 .",
    "the angular momentum lost by superfluid is imparted to the crust and the core which is strongly coupled to it @xcite , giving @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the moment of inertia of the region of rapid vortex creep . since only 1/2 of the crust has @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 and @xmath94    the rapid creep of vortex lines following a large starquake could explain the giant glitches with @xmath95 observed in the vela and other pulsars .    in the above estimate",
    "we assume that the lag between the superfluid and the crust is large enough to supply the needed angular momentum to the crust . as the vortex lines creep through a distance @xmath96 the local superfluid slows by @xmath97 .",
    "if the pre - starquake lag velocity @xmath43 were less than this value , the vortex creep would stop before the vortex lines move the full distance @xmath96 . a necessary condition for the above estimate to be valid is that @xmath98 .",
    "since @xmath99 we have @xmath100 .",
    "the limiting factor in the size of a starquake - induced pulsar glitch may be the pre - glitch lag velocity .",
    "the reason for the large difference between the size of the crab glitches and the giant glitches of the vela pulsar may be that in the crab pulsar , with its higher internal temperature , vortex creep between glitches limits the build up of a sufficiently large @xmath43 .",
    "starquakes tilt the principal axis of inertia of a neutron star . as the star relaxes to its new equilibrium orientation , neutron superfluid vortex lines migrate outward , spinning up the rest of the star .",
    "the spin ups from large quakes may explain the giant glitches observed in isolated pulsars .",
    "the change in the direction of the magnetic axis may increase the spin - down torque , as observed in the crab and other pulsars .",
    "detailed calculations of the post - starquake relaxation for both large and smaller events may yield distinctive timing signatures to compare with observations .",
