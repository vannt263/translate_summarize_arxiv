    "there is a well - known analogy between black hole physics and thermodynamics .",
    "this fact is called the black hole thermodynamics  @xcite . in particular , as first pointed out by bekenstein  @xcite , we can think of the area of the black hole horizon as the entropy ( up to a proportional constant ) by using the area theorem  @xcite which states that the area of the black hole horizon does not decrease . since the black hole emits thermal radiation of matter , which is called the hawking radiation  @xcite , we can decide the temperature of the black hole .",
    "thus , the entropy of the black hole is calculated as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the area of the horizon and @xmath2 is the planck length .",
    "this is the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "there have been many attempts to understand the origin of this black hole entropy : for example , those considerations on the basis of the value of the euclidean action  @xcite , the rate of the pair creation of black holes  @xcite , the noether charge of the bifurcate killing horizon  @xcite or the central charge of the virasoro algebra  @xcite . among past considerations ,",
    "we consider the entanglement entropy   as the most attractive candidate for the black hole entropy .",
    "the entanglement entropy is the measure of the information loss due to a division of the system ; this direct connection of the entropy with the information loss is not clear in some other approaches to the black hole entropy .",
    "if we divide the system into two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and ignore the information about @xmath3 and observe only @xmath1 , we can view the pure state of the total system as an effective mixed state for the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "the entanglement entropy is the von neumann entropy of this effective mixed state .",
    "if the original pure state is an entangled state , the entanglement entropy is non - zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if the original pure state is not an entangled state , the entanglement entropy is zero .",
    "that is , if the original pure state is not entangled , there is no information loss when we ignore @xmath3 .",
    "note that the entangled state and the entanglement entropy is a purely quantum mechanical notion and there is no counterpart in classical physics .",
    "when the concept of the entanglement entropy is applied to the black hole , it measures the information loss due to a spatial separation .",
    "most previous works on the entanglement entropy were concentrated on the entanglement between the bulk regions outside and inside of the black hole horizon . in this paper , we instead discuss the entanglement between the outside and a thin region ( of the order of the planck length ) inside of the horizon . for this reason , we call this as the entanglement entropy of the black hole `` horizon '' .",
    "we consider that this approach is justified physically by the following discussion : for simplicity , we consider a quantum field on the extended schwarzschild spacetime rather than a dynamical spacetime which describes the gravitational collapse to the black hole .",
    "since we want to calculate the entropy of the black hole itself , the quantum state of the field must be a `` vacuum '' .",
    "we thus consider the killing vacuum , which is defined by using the killing time .",
    "( note that the kruskal vacuum , which is defined by using the kruskal time , contains the thermal radiation of the killing particles , namely , the hawking radiation .",
    "therefore , if we chose the kruskal vacuum , the resultant entropy would be considered as the entropy of the black hole and its correction by the matter field . ) since the killing vacuum is expressed as the tensor product of the states in one asymptotically flat region ( outside ) and the other asymptotically flat region ( inside ) , the entanglement entropy between the inside and outside of the horizon becomes zero .    however , if we consider the effect of the quantum gravity , this vanishing entanglement entropy is not true any more since we can not divide the system sharply due to the quantum fluctuation of the horizon . by this correction ,",
    "the killing vacuum is deformed to some entangled states between the inside and outside of the ( classical ) horizon .",
    "the depth of the entanglement is of the order of the planck length because this is the effect of the quantum gravity . of course , it is difficult to achieve such a calculation . to estimate this entanglement entropy , we first assume that the thin regions of the order of the planck length outside and inside the horizon are completely entangled by quantum effects .",
    "namely , the main features of the states in the thin region inside the horizon are smoothly extrapolated from those of the outside the horizon .",
    "the major ansatz of our calculation is that the entanglement entropy between the thin region inside the horizon and all the states outside the horizon is approximated by the entanglement entropy of the killing vacuum between the thin region of the order of the planck length _ outside _ the horizon and the rest of the states outside the horizon .",
    "that is , we consider that the effect of the quantum gravity is approximated by the shift of the ( classical ) division of the system rather than the deformation of the state .",
    "the shift is of the order of the planck length because this is induced by the quantum fluctuation of the horizon .",
    "the present ansatz is analogous to the setting which has been considered in ref.@xcite in a different context .",
    "they have considered a thin spherical shell infalling toward a schwarzschild black hole and the entanglement entropy of the killing vacuum associated with the division by a timelike surface which becomes the horizon _",
    "after _ the passage of the shell , but it is in the schwarzschild spacetime _ before _ the passage of the shell .",
    "our case is different since we analyze the entanglement entropy generated by quantum effects after the formation of the classical horizon .",
    "also , the calculation becomes much simpler in this paper .",
    "the key point is that the entanglement entropy is symmetric under an interchange of the role of the subsystems a and b. our setting and this symmetric property make the calculation very simple and substantially reduce the needed numerical calculation .",
    "moreover , since the calculation in this paper is based on the bombelli - koul - lee - sorkin type calculation  @xcite rather than the srednicki type calculation  @xcite , we can find directly that the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area without plotting the entanglement entropy to the area .",
    "there are some comments on the above setting of the calculation in this paper : as is well known , euclidean geometry plays an important role in the gibbons - hawking method  @xcite or some other euclidean approaches to the black hole entropy .",
    "especially , the temperature of the black hole can be well understood as the period of the euclidean time in euclidean geometry  @xcite .",
    "since the entropy is the conjugate variable to the temperature , we want to understand it within euclidean geometry . however , the euclidean black hole does not have the `` inside '' of the horizon  @xcite . on the other hand , in euclidean gravity ,",
    "the horizon is the fixed point of the euclidean time translation , called the bolt  @xcite , and an obstruction to the foliation by the euclidean time .",
    "therefore , to achieve the hamiltonian formulation , we want to eliminate the degrees of freedom near the horizon  @xcite . for this reason , the above setting of our calculation appears to be reasonable if we persist on the euclidean picture .",
    "then , we notice that the energy , temperature and entropy could be understood in relation to the euclidean time translation : that is , we regard that the energy is its charge , the temperature is its period and the entropy is concerned with its fixed point .",
    "moreover , to reach the horizon , we need an infinite time if the `` time '' is measured by the asymptotically minkowski time ( not the proper time ) .",
    "thus , we can consider that the horizon is a `` boundary '' , at least , for the observer at infinity .",
    "however , we do not impose any boundary condition at the horizon since we do not make any measurement there .",
    "consequently , it is natural to take the summation over the state at the horizon  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec.[formula ] , we briefly review the notion and basic properties of the entanglement entropy , and then derive a basic formula to calculate it . in sec.[model ] , we construct two models and calculate the entanglement entropy explicitly . in sec.[conclude ] , we conclude and discuss the results of this paper .",
    "we review the notion and properties of the entanglement entropy and then derive a basic formula  @xcite to calculate it .",
    "let us consider the case where the total system can be divided into two subsystems .",
    "then , the hilbert space of the total system @xmath4 can be written by the tensor product , @xmath5 a state @xmath6 is called entangled if the state can _ not _ be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is an entangled state and @xmath13 is not an entangled state .",
    "moreover , we assume that we are going to ignore the degrees of freedom of @xmath14 . to achieve this ,",
    "we define a reduced density matrix @xmath15 for @xmath16 from the ( pure ) state of the total system @xmath17 , whose matrix elements are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the arbitrary states of @xmath16 and @xmath20 are the orthonormal basis of @xmath14 .",
    "then , the expectation value of an operator @xmath21 which acts only on @xmath16 becomes @xmath22 where the trace is taken over the states of @xmath16 . by this way ,",
    "as far as the subsystem @xmath16 is concerned , the pure state of the total system @xmath17 can be viewed as the mixed state @xmath15 .",
    "now , the entanglement entropy is defined by the von neumann entropy of this reduced density matrix , @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of @xmath15 .",
    "note that the range of the entanglement entropy is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dimension of @xmath16 .",
    "if the original state @xmath17 is not entangled , @xmath15 remains pure and , thus , @xmath27 becomes zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath17 is entangled , @xmath15 becomes a mixed state and @xmath27 is nonzero .",
    "thus , the entanglement entropy is a measure of the entangled nature ( or epr correlation ) of the original state .",
    "for example , let us consider the system which consists of two spin-1/2 particles :    if a state of the system is an epr state , @xmath28 then the reduced density matrix becomes @xmath29 and the entanglement entropy is @xmath30 .",
    "this state has the maximum entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "note that , since there is a perfect epr correlation between these particles , we can get full information about one particle by an observation of the other particle .",
    "thus , these particles are maximally entangled .    on the other hand ,",
    "if a state of the system is not an entangled state , @xmath31 then the reduced density matrix becomes @xmath32 and the entanglement entropy is @xmath33 .",
    "this state does not have the entanglement entropy .",
    "note that , since there is no epr correlation between these particles , we can not get any information about one particle by an observation of the other particle .",
    "thus , these particles are not entangled .",
    "note that one of the important properties of the entanglement entropy is that it is symmetric under an interchange of the role of @xmath16 and @xmath14 , @xmath34 this is because the entanglement entropy measures the epr `` correlation '' between two subsystems , which is symmetric by definition . as for more detailed analysis ,",

    "the _ proper _ length of this fluctuation becomes @xmath186 note that @xmath183 is proportional to @xmath26 , since the rate of spontaneous quantum emission or absorption of particles is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the fluctuation of the horizon is proportional to @xmath181 in the proper length .",

    "therefore , if the species of matter fields becomes @xmath26 , the entanglement entropy of the horizon becomes @xmath189 which is independent of @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we thus consider this entanglement entropy of the horizon as the entropy of the `` black hole '' itself rather than the `` matter field '' .",
    "the result of our analysis suggests that we can consider that the information on the collapsed star is stored as the epr correlation between the outside and neighborhood ( of the order of the planck length ) of the horizon .",
    "since the horizon remains stable to the planck scale , we can encode the enormous information on the collapsed star .",
    "if we used an ordinary wall , we could not do so because it begins to fluctuate far below the planck scale .",
    "the information available outside the horizon is the probability distribution of the effective states ( the effective density matrix ) when we ignore the field near the horizon . note that this consideration does not contradict with the no - hair theorem .",
    "moreover , this picture appears to be consistent with the euclidean path - integral approach by gibbons and hawking  @xcite .",
    "the entropy in that approach arises from the fixed point of the euclidean time translation or non - trivial topology of @xmath190 section . in our analysis",
    ", we find that the quantities which appear in the first law of the black hole thermodynamics can be understood in relation to the euclidean time translation : that is , the energy is its charge , the temperature is its period and the entropy is concerned with its fixed point .",
    "finally , to be more realistic , we have to consider the case where the shape of the horizon is @xmath127 , like eq.([black ] ) .",
    "we then have to expand the field by the spherical harmonics @xmath191 .",
    "however , we expect that this would not change the result drastically and would turn out to be consistent with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath192 this is because as long as the radius of the sphere is much larger than the planck length @xmath193 ( which is equivalent to the near - horizon limit ) , we can approximate the horizon as a plane . of course , by using the method developed in this paper which is based on the bombelli - koul - lee - sorkin type calculation  @xcite rather than the srednicki type calculation  @xcite , we will be able to obtain the result in a much simpler and more direct way .",
    "this is left for a future work .",
