    "inspired on feynman s ratchet and pawl device @xcite , such phenomenon has been named after the ratchet effect .",
    "moreover , when the environment is thermally fluctuating , brownian transport is crucially affected and controlled by noise ( for a broad review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "its relevance to molecular engines , such as motors , pumps and channels , has been proposed from the foundation idea of the so - called brownian motors @xcite .",
    "brownian pumping is then an active nonequilibrium transport process in which fluctuations play a very important role . regarding experiments , na , k  atpase pumps",
    "have been perturbed by an oscillating electric field @xcite , driving ions whose net flux was measured as a function of the amplitude and frequency of the field .",
    "the flux of particles created by pumping machines has been studied theoretically in @xcite .",
    "a typical ratchet mechanism is often assumed in the modeling and so normalization of the probability distribution and periodic boundary conditions are imposed . in this work",
    ", the scope is different .",
    "while the ratchet mechanism is still the responsible for the transport of particles , we focus on the nonequilibrium concentration gradient created and maintained by the pump at both sides of the membrane . the system is considered finite and not infinitely periodic .",
    "then , our main observable is not only the flux @xmath0 of particles but the density profile @xmath1 in the membrane and the ratio of concentrations @xmath2 created at the particle reservoirs .",
    "see figure [ pot ] .",
    "the structure of paper is the following .",
    "first we introduce the model for the brownian pump by means of a langevin equation , which can be mapped into a seebeck ratchet @xcite . in the steady state , a standard theoretical analysis is carried out to obtain the non - equilibrium density of particles @xmath1 that is generated at zero and finite flux .",
    "the flux @xmath0 itself is also determined .",
    "then we present a simple numerical scheme from which the densities and fluxes can be measured and satisfactorily compared to the predictions . for a piece ",
    "linear saw  tooth potential we calculate explicitly the expressions derived in the analysis and explore them as a function of the main parameters of the system .",
    "we end with some conclusions and comments for future work .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      we can recall expression ( [ jteoo ] ) for the total flux of particles and rewrite it as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the concentration in the right reservoir when @xmath7 , which is calculated in ( [ rho102 ] ) . for the linear saw ",
    "tooth potential , the above formal expression can be explicitly expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 expression ( [ newj ] ) fulfills the symmetry @xmath11 when @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which means that if we take the mirror image of the set up , we should see the same flux going to the opposite direction .",
    "note that when @xmath7 only the ratio of densities is relevant , while for @xmath14 , both values are needed separately .",
    "there is a decreasing linear behavior of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath15 , as it is clear from simple inspection of ( [ jone ] ) and ( [ newj ] ) .",
    "if @xmath16 the flux is reversed because entropic forces surmount the pumping driving .    in fig .",
    "[ jrho ] the normalized flux @xmath3 is plotted as a function of the density ratio @xmath17 .",
    "the simulation points are successfully obtained from the method explained in the numerical scheme section . increasing the length @xmath18 of the left and right reservoirs the value of the flux @xmath0 decreases .",
    "we can measure it from the slope of the linear profile of the density in such regions and also extract @xmath19 and @xmath15 . despite some small deviations due to the errors in the process of data obtention because of finite statistics and non zero @xmath20",
    ", we can say that theory and simulations are in agreement .",
    "this confirms the validity of the numerical scheme proposed , which allows to measure fluxes and concentrations from simple numerical simulations which have a clear physical interpretation .",

    "the system parameters are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "solid line corresponds to theory , equation ( [ newj ] ) , and circles to simulation data ]",
    "brownian pumps , unlike typical brownian motors , do not aim to create a net flux of particles in periodic boundary conditions , but instead to achieve and actively keep a density gradient between two reservoirs .",
    "we have studied a simple model in which the ratchet effect together with appropriate boundary conditions leads to such mechanism .",
    "it has been thoroughly characterized from the theoretical point of view with analytical exact results . moreover , a new and simple numerical scheme has been proposed to measure concentrations and fluxes , faithfully reproducing all the theoretical predictions .",
    "the efficiency of such devices is not easy to investigate since one should analyze how much energy the fluctuating potential is inserting into de pump and what is the energetic profit taken out from such input .",
    "this issue together with the use of physical parameters in the biological scale is under study .",
    "the present work is then a starting point for modeling nanometric bio - machines , such as channels and pumps , which control the flux of particles across the cell membrane .",
