    "the general topic of our study is the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of @xmath9 non - symmetric random matrices with real entries .",
    "such matrices will , in general , have both real and complex eigenvalues . in the case that the entries of the matrix are independently chosen as standard gaussians  referred to as the real ginibre ensemble after @xcite",
    " a result of edelman _",
    "et al _ @xcite tells us that the expected number of real eigenvalues is asymptotically equal to @xmath10 .",
    "numerical evidence presented in the same paper indicates that this asymptotic value persists with the standard gaussian replaced by any distribution of zero mean and unit standard deviation .",
    "similar properties hold true of the generalised eigenvalues of a pair of @xmath0 random matrices @xmath1 with standard gaussian entries .",
    "the generalised eigenvalues @xmath11 are specified as the solutions of @xmath12 , or equivalently , as the eigenvalues of @xmath4 .",
    "the statistical properties of the @xmath11 are the specific concern of this paper",
    ". our starting point will be to first establish the joint matrix distribution of @xmath13 , which we show in proposition [ prop : elementjpdf ] to be the matrix cauchy distribution @xmath14    studies into the statistical properties of the @xmath11 were initiated in @xcite using a different logic .",
    "it was shown , for example , that the expected number @xmath15 of real ( generalised ) eigenvalues has the exact evaluation @xmath16 to derive ( [ eqn : eks_result ] ) , the generalised eigenvalue problem in the case of @xmath5 having standard gaussian elements was placed in the context of integral geometry .",
    "first the pair of matrices @xmath1 can be regarded as two vectors in @xmath17 and the corresponding plane spanned by these vectors intersects the sphere @xmath18 to give a great circle .",
    "the real generalised eigenvalues correspond to the intersection of this great circle with the set @xmath19 of all @xmath9 singular matrices @xmath20 such that @xmath21 ( thus choose @xmath22 for suitable @xmath23 ) . with @xmath5 having standard gaussian entries , the great circle has uniform measure , so the expected number of real eigenvalues is equal to the expected number of intersections of @xmath19 with a random great circle .",
    "another feature of the random generalised eigenvalue problem studied in @xcite is the density @xmath24 of real generalised eigenvalues . by writing @xmath25",
    "the generalised eigenvalue equation reads @xmath26 .",
    "using the fact that a pair of standard gaussians @xmath27 is , as a distribution in the plane , invariant under rotation , it was noted that @xmath28 must be distributed uniformly on the unit circle , and so @xmath29    the transformation @xmath25 is the stereographic projection of the real line on to a great circle of the sphere . from the famous circle theorem @xcite relating to eigenvalue densities of large @xmath9 matrices with general iid entries drawn from any distribution with mean zero and fixed @xmath30",
    ", one might similarly expect uniform asymptotic density on the sphere for @xmath31 where @xmath32 also have iid entries from any distribution with zero mean and fixed @xmath30  a kind of spherical law .",
    "certainly , in the case of complex gaussian entries , this is true for every value of @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , with @xmath34 where @xmath35 such that @xmath36 , one has that @xmath37 has the same distribution as @xmath38 , implying that the corresponding joint eigenvalue distribution is invariant under rotation of the sphere @xcite . in the traditions of random matrix theory",
    " for example the circular ensembles of dyson  the present real gaussian matrices @xmath31 may be said to form the real spherical ensemble . in @xcite",
    "the complex gaussian matrices @xmath31 were referred to as the ( complex ) spherical ensemble .    from ( [ eqn : rho ] ) and the fact that with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , we see that as a distribution on the sphere , the density of real eigenvalues is uniform",
    ". one can also stereographically project the complex eigenvalues on to the sphere ; it will turn out ( eq .  ( [ df ] ) below ) that in the large @xmath33 limit the total eigenvalue distribution is uniform .",
    "thus , to leading order , the concentration of real eigenvalues on a great circle of the sphere does not affect the overall eigenvalue distribution .",
    "this is analogous to the situation for the real ginibre ensemble , for which the expected number of real eigenvalues is asymptotically @xmath41 , yet the eigenvalue density is to leading order uniform @xcite .",
    "also , we remark that there is an analogy with the random polynomials @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when stereographically projected onto the sphere there is of order @xmath43 zeros on a great circle corresponding to the real axis @xcite , but for @xmath33 large the density is asymptotically uniform on the sphere @xcite",
    ".     matrices with the eigenvalues stereographically projected . the great circle of real eigenvalues can be clearly seen . ]",
    "so in summary , from the pioneering study of the gaussian real generalised eigenvalue problem of @xcite , we know the expected number of real eigenvalues and the density of real eigenvalues . beginning with ( [ eqn : elementjpdf ] ) , this statistical knowledge will be greatly extended .",
    "an essential ingredient in our analysis is to conformally map from the real line and upper half - plane ( _ i.e. _ the domain of the independent eigenvalues of @xmath44 ) to the boundary of the unit disk by the fractional linear transformation @xmath45 for @xmath11 a real eigenvalue , and with @xmath46 , ( [ 7 ] ) reads @xmath47 a key feature is that the corresponding real eigenvalue density is uniform in @xmath48 @xmath49 as follows from ( [ eqn : rho ] ) . in terms of ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 14.2 ] )",
    "we show that the explicit form of the joint eigenvalue probability density function ( jpdf ) for @xmath7 real eigenvalues is @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath53 which is the content of proposition [ thm : ainvb_jpdf ] .",
    "we use ( [ eqn : q(y ) ] ) to deduce exact statistical properties . as an example , let @xmath6 denote the probability that there are exactly @xmath7 real eigenvalues , and set @xmath54 where the asterisk indicates that the sum over @xmath7 is restricted to values with the same parity as @xmath33 . in proposition [ prop : gen_fn ] , with @xmath33 even , we show @xmath55 where @xmath56 the product form ( [ 3a ] ) for @xmath57 should be contrasted with the simplest known forms in the case of the real ginibre ensemble @xcite , which are determinants of size @xmath58 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eqn : z_n ] ) that @xmath59 where we have used the fact that @xmath60 . substituting ( [ 3a ] )",
    "then reclaims ( [ eqn : eks_result ] ) with @xmath33 even . in corollary [ prop : odd_en_var ]",
    "we give the odd analogue of ( [ 3.1 ] ) and with ( [ 3a ] ) we again reclaim ( [ eqn : eks_result ] ) .",
    "the variance in the distribution of the number of real eigenvalues is , by definition , given by @xmath61 , which , in terms of the generating function , reads @xmath62 substituting ( [ eqn : z_n ] ) and ( [ 3.1 ] ) , we then obtain the explicit evaluation @xmath63 this has large @xmath33 form @xmath64 , which is the same as for the real ginibre ensemble @xcite .    recalling ( [ 3 ] ) we can read off the explicit value of @xmath6 . for @xmath65 odd it is a rational number , while for @xmath65 even it is of the form @xmath66 with @xmath67 rational ( proposition [ p310 ] ) . in particular , for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and for @xmath70 , @xmath71 as decimals ( [ 2.2 ] ) reads @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "these values , further approximated to @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , have been reported in a simulation of the @xmath76 case @xcite .",
    "the latter study was motivated by the question of determining the typical rank of a @xmath77 array ( tensor ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the meaning of a tensor in this setting relates to structures @xmath78 represented as the column vector @xmath79 . as reviewed in @xcite , a point of interest",
    "is to find matrices @xmath80",
    "\\in \\mathbb r^{p \\times r}$ ] , @xmath81 \\in \\mathbb r^{p \\times r}$ ] and @xmath82 \\in \\mathbb r^{2 \\times r}$ ] such that @xmath83 for @xmath84 as small as possible .",
    "the positive integer @xmath84 is referred to the rank . with both @xmath85 and @xmath86 random matrices , entries chosen from a continuous distribution , one has that @xmath87 if all the eigenvalues of @xmath88 are real , and @xmath89 otherwise .",
    "the simple structure of ( [ eqn : z_n ] ) also allows for the computation of the large @xmath33 form of the distribution of the number @xmath7 of real eigenvalues . in proposition [ pab ]",
    "we prove that it is a standard gaussian in the scaled variable @xmath90 .",
    "further , our method of derivation of ( [ eqn : z_n ] ) , which involves first computing the exact functional form of the eigenvalue jpdf ( [ eqn : q(y ) ] ) , allows for the result ( [ eqn : rho ] ) to be generalised .",
    "thus , in theorem [ thm : correlns ] we give a @xmath91 pfaffian formula for the exact @xmath92-point correlation function between @xmath93 real eigenvalues and @xmath94 complex eigenvalues .",
    "the simplest case beyond ( [ eqn : rho ] ) is the density of the complex eigenvalues in terms of the coordinates ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "with @xmath95 we find that the complex density @xmath96 depends only on @xmath97 , and is given by @xmath98 the densities ( [ eqn : rhoc ] ) and ( [ eqn : rhor ] ) are related by the sum rule for the total number of eigenvalues @xmath99 where the factor of 2 is required since @xmath100 only refers to one of each complex conjugate pair .",
    "section 4 continues with the evaluation of the average of two characteristic polynomials in terms of elements of the correlation kernel .",
    "we also compute the scaled limit of the @xmath92-point correlation function , and demonstrate that it agrees with the recently obtained @xcite scaled correlation function for the bulk eigenvalues in the real ginibre ensemble . an analogy with a coulomb gas allows for the formulation of sum rules relating to the screening of the effective charge of a fixed number of eigenvalues , and also allows us to isolate a certain combination of one- and two - point correlations for which the complex moments vanish .",
    "for @xmath32 matrices of size @xmath0 taken from ginibre s real ensemble so that @xmath101 we wish to express the probability density function @xmath102 of the elements of the matrix @xmath103 in terms of the elements of @xmath44 .",
    "this we read off from the calculation of @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the wedge product of the independent elements of the matrix @xmath106 .",
    "[ prop : elementjpdf ] let @xmath32 be @xmath0 matrices drawn from the real ginibre ensemble , and let @xmath103 .",
    "the density function for the distribution of the elements of @xmath44 is then given by ( [ eqn : elementjpdf ] ) .",
    "we delay the proof of this result until appendix [ app : py ] .",
    "for a general @xmath9 non - symmetric real matrix , we will have @xmath107 real eigenvalues , where @xmath33 has the same parity as @xmath7 . from knowledge of ( [ eqn : elementjpdf ] )",
    "we can extract the eigenvalue distribution for each allowed @xmath7 . in this task",
    "we are motivated by the work of hough _ et al _ @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we work with the real schur decomposition @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is real orthogonal ( each column is an eigenvector of @xmath44 , with the restriction that the entry in the first row is positive ) and @xmath110,\\hspace{12pt}m=(n+k)/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath111 is block upper triangular : on the diagonal we have the real eigenvalues @xmath112 and the @xmath113 blocks @xmath114,\\hspace{18pt}b_j , c_j>0,\\end{aligned}\\]]which relates to the complex eigenvalues @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",

    "we need the eigenvalues to be ordered and we choose @xmath124    since we are looking to change variables from the elements of @xmath44 to the eigenvalues of @xmath44 , as implied by the real schur decomposition , before proceeding we first need knowledge of the corresponding jacobian . from @xcite we know that @xmath125where @xmath126 for @xmath127 , while @xmath128 for @xmath129 , and @xmath130 is the strictly upper triangular part of @xmath111 .",
    "our interest is only in the eigenvalue dependent portion so we can immediately dispense with the dependence on @xmath109 by integrating out @xmath131 according to @xmath132 ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1.15 ) , with the modification of omitting the factor of @xmath133 since we have specified the columns of @xmath109 to have positive first entry ) .    for our goal of computing the eigenvalue jpdf the objective now is to integrate over all the @xmath134 ; this procedure is similar to that in @xcite where that author was concerned with the analogous complex ensemble .",
    "the details in the present setting are contained in appendix [ app:2 ] . according to this",
    "working ( [ eqn : elementjpdf ] ) has been reduced to the distribution of @xmath135 , @xmath136 where use has been made of the simplification @xmath137    by writing @xmath138 and @xmath139 we see that @xmath140 . also , from @xcite , we know that @xmath141",
    "although we require @xmath142 rather than @xmath143 as claimed by edelman .",
    "so now we integrate over @xmath144 @xmath145 substituting ( [ eqn : delta_integ ] ) in ( [ eqn : reduced_dist ] ) as appropriate gives the reduced jpdf , but ( [ eqn : delta_integ ] ) as written appears intractable for further analysis . on the other hand it follows from the analysis relating to ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath146 that when projected on to the sphere the eigenvalue density is unchanged by rotation in the @xmath147 plane , where @xmath148 are the co - ordinates after stereographic projection .",
    "this suggests that simplifications can be achieved by an appropriate mapping of the half - plane that contains the rotational symmetry of the half sphere .",
    "we therefore introduce the fractional linear transformation ( [ 7 ] ) mapping the upper half - plane to the interior of the unit disk , and ( [ 14.2 ] ) mapping the real line to the unit circle .",

    "firstly , for each @xmath611 , we let @xmath612 and apply lemma [ lem : tilde_const_covarbs ] to get @xmath613 and @xmath614 and so , with @xmath615 , @xmath616 where use was made of lemma [ lem : beta=1jacobian ] for the second equality , and the change of variables @xmath617 for the third .",
    "a ratio of selberg integrals has again appeared in ( [ eqn : compx_selberg ] ) , and using results from @xcite we find @xmath618 the case @xmath33 odd , @xmath619 , corresponding to @xmath620 is special since then @xmath611 consists of 1 row and 2 columns , and thus is the only case in which the number of rows is less than the number of columns .",
    "we must then write @xmath621 using ( [ eqn:1+ab ] ) . however , it turns out that the change this implies to ( [ eqn : compx_selberg ] ) does not effect the evaluation ( [ 12 ] ) , even though ( [ 11 ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "so in all cases , after having integrated over the @xmath134 for @xmath622 in the columns corresponding to complex eigenvalues we are left with @xmath623        we see that we are left with a function of @xmath624 , which is the upper - left sub - block of @xmath111 and we isolate the last row and column @xmath625,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath626 is of size @xmath627 and @xmath599 is of size @xmath628 .",
    "following the same procedure as for the complex eigenvalue columns , we find @xmath629 setting @xmath630 and again making use of lemma [ lem : alpha_tensor_beta ] we have @xmath631 iterating over the remaining columns of @xmath624 gives @xmath632 ( cf .",
    "( [ eqn : with_subs ] ) ) . to evaluate the integrals",
    ", we use the same method as for the integrals in ( [ eqn : with_subs ] ) ( involving lemma [ lem : tilde_const_covarbs ] and now one - dimensional case of the selberg integral , which is the beta integral ) .",
    "this gives @xmath633 and so @xmath634      the work of pjf was supported by the australian research council , and am was supported by an australian postgraduate award .",
