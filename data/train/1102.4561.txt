    "according to our current understanding of stellar evolution , all stars with main sequence mass in the range 1 - 8 m@xmath0 evolve via the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase to the planetary nebula stage ( pn ) . as they ascend the agb , their mass - loss rate increases from solar - like values ( @xmath1 m@xmath0/yr@xmath2 ) up to @xmath3 m@xmath0/yr@xmath2 .",
    "this mass loss is an essential component of galactic evolution , as these are the main sources of s - process elements in the universe ( gustafsson & ryde , 1996 ) and are the main productors of carbon .",
    "agb stars are also the main contributors to the dust phase of the interstellar medium , which is important for the energy balance in galaxies . during the last stages of the agb ,",
    "the remains of the convective hydrogen envelope are ejected during final violent and sporadic mass - loss events .",
    "dust grains and molecules , predominantly co , condense in their winds , forming substantial circumstellar envelopes detectable in the infrared and millimetric domains .    a departure from spherically symmetric mass - loss",
    "is observed in a substantial fraction of suspected transition objects .",
    "in particular , multipolar structures are often associated with proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) sources ( sahai , 2002 ) .",
    "the observed morphology of these objects are projected on the sky , making it difficult to know what is the intrinsic morphology of ppne and pne .",
    "but it is estimated that around 80% of all pne show aspherical morphologies ( e.g. manchado 1997 ) .",
    "hubble space telescope observations of pne , for example , shows a large range of morphologies , including elliptical , bipolar , multipolar or round nebulae ( e.g. sahai & trauger , 1998 ) .",
    "hydrodynamical models explain many of the observed structures from a structure - magnification mechanism , where a fast wind from the central star of the pn ploughs into the earlier slow asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) wind ( kwok et al .",
    "1978 ) , amplifying any density asymmetry already present ( balick , preston & icke 1987 ; frank & mellema 1994 ) : the generalized interacting stellar wind model or gisw .",
    "another model has also been proposed by sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) to explain the shaping of pne . in their model",
    "the shaping of the pne occurs at the end of the agb phase when fast collimated jets are triggered and shape a bipolar nebula . if the direction of the jets changes with time , then multipolar nebulae can be formed .",
    "such jets could be formed through interaction with a companion , e.g. in an accretion disc ( for a review see balick & franck , 2002 ) .",
    "much of pn and ppn shaping theory relies on the presence of circumstellar material in either a dusty torus or disc .",
    "our team has discovered some discs / tori in the heart of pne ( lagadec et al .",
    "2006 , chesneau et al .",
    "2006 , matsuura et al .",
    "2006 , chesneau et al .",
    "2007 ) using adaptive optics on the very large telescope ( vlt ) and mid - infrared interferometry at the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) . but",
    "the role of these discs / tori for the shaping of the nebula is still unclear as we do not know which fraction of the total dusty mass is present in these central cores , nor the fraction of objects exhibiting such a disc / torus .",
    "these equatorial structures are likely due to the interaction of the central star with a binary companion . but observation wise , there are yet no strong direct observational evidences for this neither in the ppn phase ( hrivnak et al.,2010 ) .",
    "miszalski et al.(2009 , 2010 ) discovered some central binary systems in pne , but no clear connection between the binaries and morphological class .",
    "some binary post - agb stars are known and they have very compact discs , not resolveable with direct imaging but only with interferrometry .",
    "these discs are lickely keplerian and the binary orbits revealed so far indicate that strong interaction must have taken place on the agb or even rgb .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these objects are specific and rv tauri stars with dust are mainly found in this category ( see e.g. deroo et al.,(2006 ) for the interferometry ; de ruyter et al . , ( 2006 ) for the sed ; van winckel et al . , ( 2009 ) for the binarity ;",
    "de ruyter et al . , ( 2005 ) and gielen et al .",
    "2009 for the rv tauri stars ) .    to observe the inner part of post - agb stars , we need mid - infrared observations , as the dust optical depth is smaller at longer wavelengths . mid - infrared is indeed the only wavelengths range at which we can observe the inner morphology of stars from the agb to the ppn phase .",
    "furthermore , the main source of radiation for these sources in the mid - infrared is direct emission from dust , while at shorter wavelengths this is scattered light .",
    "mid - infrared imaging is thus the best way to study the dusty structures inside these evolved stars .",
    "many mid - infrared imaging observations of agb and ppne have been made in the past .",
    "but the only mid - infrared imaging survey has been made with 3-m class telescopes ( meixner et al .",
    "1999 ) and present a lack of angular resolution for the morphological study of the observed objects , a selection bias as they observed known bipolar nebulae and consists of only 17 resolved sources .",
    "some work has been done using 8-m class telescopes , but always focusing on particular individual bright well - known objects ( e.g. miyata et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we observed 86 evolved stars ( 2 observed twice , using different modes ) using visir at the vlt , 5 using t - recs ( 2 also observed with visir ) on gemini south and 5 using michelle ( 1 also observed with visir ) on gemini north . taking into account that some objects were observed twice with different instrument , our total list of targets includes 93 objects .",
    "here we present this mid - infrared n - band imaging survey of a large number of post - agb stars .",
    "we aim at a systematic survey to probe the inner dusty regions of post - agb stars .",
    "the large sample of observations presented here comes from five distinct observing runs ( 3 visir / vlt runs:380.d-0630 ( normal mode ) , 081.d-0130 ( burst mode ) , 081.d-0616 ( normal mode ) ; 1 michelle / gemini north : gn-2005b - q-16 and 1 t - recs / gemini south run : gs-2005a - q-34 ) ) and the targets selection were done in a slightly different way for the different programs .",
    "the targets of the visir normal mode programs were selected from the previous mid - infrared catalogue by meixner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the millimetre observations compiled by bujarrabal et al .",
    "we removed the agb stars and young pne and observed all the stars observable with the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "most of the stars observed in burst mode were selected from the torun post - agb stars catalogue ( szczerba et al .",
    "2007 ) , that list 326 known post - agb stars .",
    "we selected all the post - agb stars observable in july from the eso cerro paranal observatory with an iras 12 @xmath4 m flux larger than 10 jy ( the burst mode works only for bright stars ) .",
    "these post - agb stars includes ppne , r crb stars and rv tauri stars .",
    "r crb are hydrogen deficient post - agb stars with known obscuration events ( clayton , 1996 ) .",
    "rv tauri are pulsating post - agb stars , located in the high luminosity end of the population ii cepheid instability strip ( wallerstein , 2002 ) .",
    "these rv tauri stars are likely to harbour compact dusty discs ( van winckel et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "in addition to that , we observed the brightest water fountains , and agb stars observable during this period .",
    "water fountains are oxygen - rich ppne characterized by the presence of blue and red - shifted oh and h@xmath5o masers ( likkel & morris , 1988 ) .",
    "the stars observed with gemini were selected from their infrared spectral properties .",
    "we selected star with double chemistry ( characterized by the presence of pahs and crystalline silicates in their infrared spectra ) , the unidentified 21-micron features or hints of the presence of an equatorial dusty disc / torus .",
    "we observed 93 targets : 52 ppne , 10 water fountains , 11 agb stars , 8 rv tauri stars , 4 pne , 4 massive evolved stars , 2 r crb stars , 1 be and 1 hii regions .",
    "most of the observations presented here were obtained with the mid - infrared instrument visir on the vlt ( lagage et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "all the stars were observed with 3 filters : pah1 ( 8.59@xmath4 m , half band width 0.42@xmath4 m ) , sic ( 11.85@xmath4 m , 2.34@xmath4 m ) and neii ( 12.81@xmath4 m , 0.21@xmath4 m ) .",
    "the pah1 and neii filters were chosen for their good sensitivities and their location at the blue and red edge of the mid - infrared n band .",
    "they also avoid the large opacities of the sic or silicates features and provide information on the dust continuum for both oxygen and carbon - rich stars .",
    "the broad sic filter was chosen to provide a general n band view .",
    "images obtained with the sic filter generally have a higher signal to noise ratio due to the better sensitivity of this broad band filter .",
    "as all our selected targets are bright , we used the minimum integration time of 30s for all the filters in all our observations .",
    "we used the imager in normal and burst mode , using a pixel scale of 0.075 arcsec and a field of view of 19.2 @xmath6 19.2 arcsec .",
    "we used the standard chopping / nodding technique to remove the noise from the sky . with the burst mode ,",
    "all the single chopping and nodding images are recorded , allowing the reconstruction of quality - enhanced images using shift and add techniques and lucky imaging .",
    "we used the standard chopping / nodding technique to remove the background , with a perpendicular chop throw , a chopping frequency of 0.25 hz and an amplitude of 8 arcsec .",
    "we shifted and added the images using a maximum of correlation algorithm , after removing the bad images , selected as the one for which the measured flux was smaller than the mean flux of all the images minus one sigma .",
    "the great observing conditions during our run ( 0.43 mm of water in the atmosphere ) allowed us to obtain great quality diffraction - limited images .",
    "the normal mode data were reduced using the visir eso pipeline .",
    "the pipeline first detect the bad pixels , and clean them using an interpolation with neighbouring pixels .",
    "nodding images are then created by averaging the images in the two positions of the chopper .",
    "the nodded images are then shifted and added to form the final combined image .",
    "images were obtained using t - recs / gemini south and filters centred at 11.3@xmath4 m ( pah , @xmath7@xmath8=0.61@xmath4 m ) and 18.3@xmath4 m ( qa , @xmath7@xmath8=1.51@xmath4 m ) .",
    "the chop throw was set to 15 arcseconds .",
    "the iraf midir data reduction package mireduce command was used to combine the different nod images .",
    "the resulting registered images were averaged together using the iraf mistack routine .",
    "the pixel scale of the obtained images is 0.09 arcseconds and the field of view of is 28.8``@xmath621.6 ''      the observations were made with the mid - infrared camera michelle on the 8-m gemini north telescope ( hawaii , usa ) in queue mode in different nights spread between the 26th of august 2005 and the 8th of january 2006 .",
    "we observed bd+30 3639 , iras21282 + 5050 , oh231.8 and the red rectangle with three n - band filters ( centred at 7.9 ( @xmath7@xmath8=0.7@xmath4 m ) 8.8 ( @xmath7@xmath8=0.9@xmath4 m ) , 9.7(@xmath7@xmath8=1.0@xmath4 m ) and 11.6 @xmath4 m ( @xmath7@xmath8=1.1@xmath4 m ) ) and the qa filter ( centred at 18.5 @xmath4 m , @xmath7@xmath8=1.9@xmath4 m ) .",
    "hd 56126 was observed with the same filters and the n - band 7.9@xmath4 m filter .",
    "the n and q band observations were made at different dates due to the more stringent weather requirements at q band .",
    "the standard chopping - nodding technique was used to remove the sky , with a chop throw of 15 arcsec .",
    "the spatial resolution measured from standard stars was typically @xmath90.4 arcsec at 10@xmath4 m and @xmath90.6 arcsec at 18.5@xmath4 m .",
    "the field of view was 32@xmath624  and the pixel scale 0.099  .",
    "michelle data files contains planes consisting of the difference for each chopped pair for each nod - set . using the gemini iraf package ,",
    "these difference images were combined to create a single frame .",
    "we thus observed in a quasi uniform way 93 evolved stars in the mid - infrared .",
    "the names , coordinates , observing modes used and generally accepted type classification of all the stars are presented in table[infostars ] .",
    "table[photostars ] presents photometric measurements from the stars from two microns all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) .",
    "the visir mid - infrared detector used for most of the observations suffers from striping and the appearance of ghosts for bright stars .",
    "the stripes are horizontal and repeated every 16 pixels , while the ghosts are distributed vertically every 16 columns .",
    "this produces artefacts that could bring confusion for the image morphology classification .",
    "for all the targets , we observed standard stars just after or before the observations .",
    "these standards stars were selected to have a similar airmass to our targets .",
    "these observations were reduced in a similar way as the science targets .",
    "they were used as a measurement of the point - spread function ( psf ) and for flux calibration purposes .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using standard aperture photometry methods , applied to the program and reference stars .",
    "all the resolved targets were deconvolved using a richardson - lucy algorithm and @xmath930 iterations , depending on the quality of the images .",
    "for each star and each filter observation , we estimated the ellipticity of the obtained image using an ellipse fitting procedure to all the signal larger than 3 times the standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "this gives us an orientation of the object , as well as its dimensions along its major axis and the axis perpendicular to this axis . to estimate",
    "whether the objects were resolved or not , we fitted a gaussian to the observed radial profiles for the objects ( on the non - deconvolved images ) and their associated psf standard for the different filters . given the seeing stability due to the exceptionally good weather condition for the visir burst mode run , it is straightforward to estimate whether an object is extended or not for objects observed in burst mode . for objects observed in service mode , we estimated that the objects were extended when the object was 50% more extended than its associated psf . for some dubious cases , where there were hints of an extension in a given direction , we also checked the literature for similar structures observed at different wavelengths .",
    "we observed 93 objects , and according to our measurements , 59 are point sources .",
    "a brief description of the properties of the resolved targets is presented in table [ resolved ] . among these extended targets , we resolved a wealth of different structures , such as resolved central cores , dark central lanes , detached shells , s - shaped outflows .",
    "the asymmetrical object ( iras 12405@xmath106219 ) was misclassified as a post - agb star and is in fact an h  ii region ( suarez et al . ,",
    "one object ( iras 18184@xmath101302 ) appears square - shaped object and is also a misclassified post - agb . it is a be star ( tuthill & lloyd , 2007 ) .    if we consider only the ppne from our sample , we end up with a sample of 52 detected objects .",
    "29 of this objects are not resolved and 6 are marginally resolved . among the 17 clearly resolved objects ,",
    "we find 3 ellipticals , 10 bipolars and 4 multipolars .",
    "all 11 agb stars that we observed are unresolved , as well as the 8 rv tau stars .",
    "this seems to indicate that no dust shell is present around these stars or at least no large and bright shells .",
    "half of the 10 water fountains we observed are resolved .",
    "none of the resolved ones are spherical .",
    "we observed 4 bipolar water fountains , most of them with a dark equatorial lane , and one multipolar .",
    "for the rcrb stars , one ( iras 14316@xmath103920 ) appears unresolved , and the other ( iras 19132@xmath103336 ) appears to be an unresolved central source with a more or less spherical dust shell around ( very weak ) .",

    "the sed of the objects with detached shells are characterized by the presence of a clear double - peaked distribution ( fig.[sed_detached ] ) , with a first peak shorter than 1 micron due to the central star , and a second peak due to the cool dust in the shell .",
    "the flux is much lower in the near - ir due to the absence of dust close to the central star .",
    "the shape of the sed can be affected by the orientation of the nebula too .",
    "the orientation of the nebula affects the ratio between the photospheric and the dust peaks of the sed ( su et al . , 2001 ) , and only if the optic depth is significant .",
    "the presence / absence of infrared excess observed in our sources is different and thus not related to orientation effects .",
    "this infrared excess due to hot dust is an indication that the dense cores play a role in the shaping of the nebulae .",
    "two main classes of models have been proposed to explain the shaping of nebulae . the first class of models is based on the generalized interacting winds models described by balick ( 1987 ) . in these models , a fast wind from the central star of a ppn or pn interacts with a slower wind , remnant of the agb phase , assumed to be toroidal .",
    "in the second class of models , the primary shaping agents are high speed collimated outflows or jets that are created at the end of the agb phase or at the beginning of the ppn phase ( sahai & trauger , 1998 ) .",
    "the interaction of these jets with a spherical agb wind will create lobes that are in fact cavities .",
    "if the direction of the jets changes with time , multipolar nebulae can be shaped .",
    "both models require the presence of a central torus / disc in the core of the nebulae .",
    "our observations clearly indicate that the bipolar and multipolar nebulae have such a central structure in their core .",
    "we resolved 25 ppne in our survey .",
    "all these nebula show a clear departure from circular symmetry .",
    "some circular shells are resolved in our survey , but only around massive evolved stars such as iras 17163 and iras 19114 . a dramatic change in the the distribution of the circumstellar material",
    "is often observed when a star evolves from the agb phase to the pn phase ( frank & balick , 2002 ) .",
    "most agb stars have a large scale cicularly symmetric morphology ( mauron & huggin , 2006 ) , while pne display a variety of morphologies from elliptical to bipolar or multipolar .",
    "parker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , from a large optical imaging survey of pne , found that 80% of the pne show a clear sign of departure from circular symmetry , and thus that @xmath920% of the pne are spherical .",
    "the shaping of the pne is thought to occur at the very end of the agb phase or the beginning of the ppn phase .",
    "it is thus surprising that in our sample of 25 resolved ppn we do not find any circular ones .",
    "the fact that we do not observe any circular ppne could be a sample selection effect .",
    "we selected our targets as bright iras 12@xmath4 m sources . to be a bright emitter at these wavelengths ,",
    "an object needs to have some dust hot enough ( @xmath9300k ) , and thus not far from the central star .",
    "this is the case for the stars with a central core , which are aspherical , as mentioned before .",
    "the spherical ppne are fainter than the non spherical ones in the mid - infrared , due to the lack of central torus / disc emitting in this wavelength range . at the end of the agb phase , the envelope of the agb progenitors of circular ppne",
    "are ejected and rapidly cool down while expanding .",
    "there are thus very few spherical ppne that are bright in the mid - infrared .",
    "furthermore those bright ppne are compact and thus difficult to spatially resolve .",
    "the best way to detect such spherical envelopes is thus at longer wavelengths .",
    "such detached shells are actually observed in the far infrared with the herschel space observatory ( kerschbaum et al . , 2010 ) .      as we mentioned in section [ 17441 ] , for iras 17441 a tilt",
    "is observed between the orientation of the central dusty torus we resolved and the tips of the observed s - shaped structure .",
    "such a tilt was observed by volk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and measured to be almost 90 degrees .",
    "they suggested that a precession of the dusty torus could explain the observed s - shaped structure of the nebula .",
    "they estimated the dynamical age of the envelope , assuming a distance of 1kpc and an expansion velocity of 100km / s , to be @xmath9100 yr .",
    "according to this , the torus should thus precess with a rate of @xmath91/yr . as our observations were made 4 years after the observations presented by volk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we should see a tilt of the torus of 4between the two observations .",
    "the images provided by these authors show that the orientation of the torus they observed is exactly the same as the one we observed .",
    "the torus in the core of iras 17441 is thus not precessing at such a high rate .",
    "when we compare the images we obtained of iras 17441 and iras 10197 , one can see some very striking similarities .",
    "both images reveal the presence of an s - shaped envelope with a resolved central dusty torus .",
    "the central torus of iras 10197 is also tilted with respect to the tips of the s - shaped structure , as noted by ueta et al .",
    "these authors estimated the tilt to be @xmath946 .",
    "some images of iras 10197 were obtained with visir in december 2005 , two and a half years prior to our observations .",
    "we retrieved and reduced these data to analyse them .",
    "the orientation of the torus appears to be exactly the same as the one we observed .",
    "assuming a distance to iras 10197 of 2kpc , an angular extension of the s - shaped structure of @xmath92.5  and an expansion of 30km / s ( sahai et al . , 1999 ) , the dynamical age of this structure is @xmath9800 yr .",
    "the torus would thus need to precess with a rate of @xmath90.06/yr to explain the s - shaped structure .",
    "such a precession rate is almost impossible to detect with the observations we have .",
    "it thus appears that we can not explain the observed s - shaped structures with a precession of the central tori .",
    "this could be due either to the fact that we underestimated the dynamical age of the nebula or that another mechanism is responsible for the s - shaped structure .",
    "a more plausible explanation is that the s - shaped structure is not due to the precession of the torus itself , but to precessing outflows inside this torus .",
    "the presence of such outflows has been observed in the pn ngc 6302 ( meaburn et al . , 2008 ) , which has a morphology very similar to those of iras 10197 and iras 17441 .",
    "these outflows are hubble - type , which means that their velocity is proportional to the distance from the source .",
    "a torus similar to the ones observed in the core of these objects is also seen in the core of ngc 6302 ( peretto et al .",
    "the properties of such outflows can be theoretically described by a sudden ejection of material , a `` bullet '' as described by dennis et al .",
    "such bullets naturally account for mulitpolar flows , that could arise naturally from the fragmentation of an explosively driven polar directed shell .",
    "it is thus likely that the s - shaped observed in iras 17441 and iras 10197 is due to high speed outflows triggered at the end of the agb phase or the beginning of the ppn phase , likely during an explosive event .      amongst the ppne and water fountains clearly resolved in our survey , 18 have a known dust chemistry : oxygen , carbon - rich or a dual dust chemistry with both carbonaceous and oxygeneous dust grains in their envelopes . for the oxygen - rich sources ,",
    "we find that 10 out of 11 are bipolar or multipolar , while the remaining one is elliptical . for the carbon - rich sources",
    ", we find that 2 are bipolar or multipolar and 2 elliptical .",
    "the three objects with a dual dust chemistry are multipolar or bipolar .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent work by guzman - ramirez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which shows a strong correlation between dual dust chemistry and the presence of an equatorial overdensity .",
    "the dual dust chemistry could be due either to the formation of pahs in an oxygen - rich torus after co photodissociation , or to the presence of a long - lived o - rich disc formed before the star turned carbon - rich due to the third dredge - up .    in their mid - infrared catalogue ,",
    "meixner et al . ( 1999 ) used a different morphological classification and found that most of the elliptical source they resolved are o - rich , while the toroidal ones tend to be c - rich .",
    "stanghellini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also studied the correlation between dust composition and morphologies .",
    "they determined , from a study of 41 magellanic clouds pne , that all pne with o - rich dust are bipolar or highly asymmetric .",
    "our study agrees with this last finding , and it seems that o - rich ppne appears to be bipolar or multipolar . as discussed by de marco ( 2009 ) , the low c / o ratio of these bipolar nebulae could be due to the interaction with a binary companion during a common envelope phase , or in the case of single star evolution , result from conversion of carbon to nitrogen .",
    "the common phase interaction will lead to the ejection of the envelope earlier than in the single star evolution scenario , leading to a less efficient dredge - up of carbon , and thus a lower c / o ratio ( izzard et al . ,",
    "the conversion of carbon to nitrogen occurs for massive agb stars with the hot bottom burning process .",
    "it is thus likely that the bipolar ppne have progenitor with larger masses than the ellitpical ones .",
    "this is in agreement with the work by corradi & schwartz ( 1995 ) , who showed that bipolar pne tend to have a higher progenitor mass .",
    "soker ( 1998 ) proposed that this could be explained in the paradigm of binary system progenitors , as primaries that undergoes a common envelope phase , and thus become bipolar , tend to have a higher mass .",
    "we imaged 93 evolved stars and nebulae in the mid - infrared using visir / vlt , t - recs / gemini south and michelle / gemini north .",
    "our observed sample contains all the post - agb stars observable from paranal with an iras 12 @xmath4 m flux density larger than 10 jy , including ppne , rcrb , rv tauri stars and water fountains .",
    "the sample also includes some 10 agb stars , 4 pne , 4 massive evolved stars , 1 h  ii region and a be star .",
    "these observations allowed us to resolve 34 objects , displaying a wealth of different structures , such as resolved central cores , dark central lanes , detached shells , s - shaped outflows .",
    "none of the agb and rv tauri stars appears to be resolved , indicating that no bright mid - infrared extended dust shells are present around these objects .",
    "circular detached shells are resolved around 2 massive evolved stars .",
    "we observed two kind of ppne :    * ppne with a dense central core , in the form of a bright central source or a dark lane , resolved or not .",
    "all these objects are bipolar or multipolar and their seds display a near - infrared excess due to hot dust from a dense structure in the core of the object * ppne with a detached shell or a visible central star .",
    "these objects are all elliptical and have a two peaked sed .",
    "none of the ppne appears to be circular , while a significant fraction of pne , the evolutionary phase after the ppn phase , are known to be spherical .",
    "this is certainly a sample bias , as we selected bright mid - infrared stars .",
    "spherical ppne have no central torus / disc emitting in this wavelength range . at the end of the agb phase",
    ", their envelope is ejected and rapidly cools down while expanding , and thus starts emitting at longer wavelengths and become brighter at longer wavelengths .",
    "such detached shells are actually observed in the far infrared with the herschel space observatory .",
    "precession of the central torii has been proposed to explain the s - shaped morphology of two of the objects we observed , iras 10197 and iras 17441 . using observations from different epochs",
    ", we do not see any sign of such a precession .",
    "we propose that the multipolar structures observed in the envelopes of these objects are due to outflows inside the torii , in a scenario similar to the one proposed by sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the dust in galaxies may be produced during the late stages of the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "this dust is ejected to the ism during the ppn phase .",
    "our observations show the existence of two paths for this dust ejection , via a detached shell or an expanding torus . to better understand the importance of ppne for the life cycle of dust",
    ", it would be interesting to study how the dust production by these objects is affected by these different paths .",
    "spatially resolved mid - infrared spectra of these sources will allow us to study the dust composition at different locations in these ppne and thus to better understand the dust evolution during the ppne phase .",

    "<S> post - agb stars are key objects for the study of the dramatic morphological changes of low- to intermediate - mass stars on their evolution from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) towards the planetary nebula stage . </S>",

    "<S> we aim at a systematic study of the dust distribution around a large sample of post - agb stars as a probe of the symmetry breaking in the nebulae around these systems . </S>",
    "<S> we used imaging in the mid - infrared to study the inner part of these evolved stars to probe direct emission from dusty structures in the core of post - agb stars in order to better understand their shaping mechanisms . </S>",

    "<S> the resolved targets can be divided in two categories . </S>",
    "<S> the nebulae with a dense central core , that are either bipolar and multipolar . </S>",
    "<S> the nebulae with no central core have an elliptical morphology . </S>",
    "<S> the dense central torus observed likely host binary systems which triggered fast outflows that shaped the nebulae .    </S>",
