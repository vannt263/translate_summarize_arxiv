    "the background spectrum is usually much harder than that of the cluster , leading to even lower surface brightness contrast at higher energies .",

    "both corrections are available in the ciao  3.1 .",
    "the new gain maps are required for analyzing s1 data ; improvements are very small for other chips .",
    "the final step is to examine background light curves during each observation in order to detect and remove the flaring episodes .",
    "the flare detection was performed following the recommendations given in markevitch et al .",

    ", our analysis uses several important recent calibration advances outlined below .",
    "acis optical blocking filters have been contaminated in - flight by a substance containing c , o , and f. photoelectric absorption in the contaminant strongly reduces the low - energy effective area .",
    "thanks to a number of calibration analyses , the properties of the contaminant are now known sufficiently accurately .",
    "the absorption spectrum of the contaminant has been measured using grating observations of bright agns with continuum spectra @xcite .",
    "time dependence of its thickness in acis - s was determined from the flux ratios of the calibration source lines .",
    "these corrections are built into ciao since v3.0 .",
    "new to our analysis is the inclusion of the spatial distribution of the contaminant .",
    "the center - to - edge difference of its optical depth is @xmath32 around 0.7  kev in both acis - i and acis - s arrays .",
    "such variations , if unaccounted for , may have a major impact on the derived icm temperatures .",
    "recently , the spatial distribution of the contaminant has been measured accurately , so that the residual variations of the effective area are less than 3% at energies above 0.6  kev @xcite .",
    "this correction was released to the _ chandra _ users in october , 2004 .",
    "an additional non - uniformity of the ccd quantum efficiency arises because for a certain fraction of photons , the trailing charge produced by cti makes them appear as charged particle - induced events , and they are screened out .",
    "earlier calibration of this effect was based on a limited dataset and lacked an accurate model for its energy dependence .",
    "the resulting quantum efficiency residuals are @xmath33 near @xmath34kev , marginally significant for the icm temperature measurements .",
    "the new calibration released with ciao  3.1 eliminates these residuals @xcite .",
    "the same ciao release corrected an error in the ccd average quantum efficiency ( qe ) for the backside illuminated chips ( s3 and s1 ) both at low and high energies @xcite .",
    "this error , if neglected , results in a @xmath35 mismatch in the temperature values determined from the back- ( bi ) and frontside illuminated ( fi ) chips .",
    "temperature profiles spanning both types of chips would be affected .",
    "finally , the released calibration underestimates the effective area of the _ chandra _ mirror by @xmath36 just above the ir m edge , probably because the mirror surface is contaminated by a thin hydro - carbon layer @xcite .",
    "we find that the corresponding effective area correction can be approximated by a `` positive absorption edge '' , @xmath37 where @xmath38  kev .",
    "this correction reduces the best - fit temperatures by 5% .",
    "the expected effect of mirror contamination on the vignetting is negligible ( d.  jerius , private communication ) .",
    "corrections of the mirror area and updates to the qe of bi chips supersede the fudge factor of 0.93 that was suggested for the fi qe @xcite .",
    "with all these recent calibration updates applied , the variations of the effective area within the _ chandra _ field of view are modeled accurately to within 3% .",
    "this is verified directly by comparison of the a1795 spectra observed at different locations @xcite , and indirectly by the agreement of the temperature profiles derived in different ccd chips .",
    "as was discussed above , correct background subtraction is crucial for temperature measurements at large radii .",
    "the acis detector background can be modeled very accurately , to within 2% _ rms _ , which is one of the major advantages of _ chandra _ over _ xmm - newton _ for studying cluster outskirts .",
    "the baseline background model can be obtained by using a compilation of the blank - field observations , processed identically to the cluster data , and `` re - projected '' onto the sky using the aspect information from the cluster pointing ( see markevitch et al .",
    "2000 for a detailed description ) .",
    "this procedure results in background residuals of @xmath39 outside the obvious flaring periods .",
    "the accuracy can be significantly improved by small adjustments to the baseline model .",
    "acis background above 2 kev is dominated by events from the charged particles .",
    "there are secular and short - term variations of the intensity of this component by as much as 30% , but its spectrum is very stable .",
    "therefore , these trends can be accounted for by simply changing the background normalization .",
    "the renormalization factor can be derived for each observation using the data in the 9.512  kev band where the _ chandra _ effective area is nearly zero and so all the observed flux is due to the background .",
    "such a renormalization reduces the uncertainties in the modeling of the quiescent background to 2% _ rms _ , provided that flaring periods were screened out properly ( markevitch et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we extract and fit cluster spectra separately in the bi and fi chips , and flare filtering is also specific for each ccd type .",
    "therefore , the background renormalizations were determined independently for these chip sets .",
    "a 2% scatter in the overall normalization per set per pointing was included in the overall temperature uncertainty budget .",
    "the accuracy of the quiescent background subtraction was verified using the spectra in the regions far from the cluster centers .",
    "in addition to the particle - induced background , the blank - field datasets contain the diffuse x - ray background .",
    "this component makes a large contribution to the total background below @xmath40  kev .",
    "the soft x - ray background was studied with _",
    "chandra _ by markevitch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and _ xmm - newton _ by lumb et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . for most of the sky above the galactic plane , the background spectrum is well represented by the mekal model with the solar metallicity and @xmath41  kev .",
    "a second component with @xmath42  kev appears in locations where the diffuse flux is high .",
    "a fraction of the soft background is geocoronal in origin and variable in time ( wargelin et al .  2004 ) .",
    "this component is dominated by the o  vii and o  viii lines and its spectrum also can be approximated with sufficient accuracy by a thermal plasma model .",
    "the blank - field datasets contain a typical mixture of the galactic and geocoronal backgrounds .",
    "since these components vary with location or time , the soft background in individual pointings is usually slightly different .",
    "therefore , appropriate adjustments are needed , even though they rarely lead to qualitative changes in the derived temperature profile .",
    "a certain fraction of the detector area in most of our observations was essentially free from the cluster emission and so we were able to determine the soft background adjustments _ in situ_. we extracted spectra in those regions , subtracted the adjusted blank - field background (  [ sec : bg : adj ] ) , and fit the residuals with an unabsorbed mekal model , whose normalization was allowed to be negative .",
    "the fit was performed in the 0.41  kev band because the soft background is usually dominated by the oxygen lines near 0.6  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a133:soft : spec ] ) .",
    "the derived adjustment is the real sky x - ray emission and is subject to the spatial variations in the effective area .",
    "therefore , it must be included as an additional component in the spectral fits , with its normalization scaled by the region area .",
    "this approach was used before by , e.g. , @xcite , and a similar method is used for _ xmm - newton _",

    "the only exceptions are a1991 and a2029 which are projected on the north polar spur . the soft background ,",
    "if neglected , would have a serious impact on the derived temperature profiles in these cases . the statistical uncertainty in the normalization of this component is included in the uncertainties for the cluster temperatures from the nominal value .",
    "the changes in the best - fit cluster @xmath7 were treated as the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "they were added to the statistical uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "identical technique was used to estimate the uncertainties related to normalization of the quiescent background . ] .",
    "our adjustment procedure implicitly assumes that there are no significant fluctuations of the soft background on @xmath43 scales .",
    "we can not test this assumption internally in each observation because cluster emission fills large fraction of the field of view .",
    "this is a limitation which can be addressed only by accurate mapping of the soft background in the vicinity of each cluster .",
    "however , we do not expect this to be a serious problem because the adjustments are usually small . in those cases with the high galactic foreground flux",
    ", we have used the _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey maps to verify the absence of surface brightness gradients on relevant spatial scales .",
    "acis ccds are exposed to the source during the readout cycle , which takes 41  ms or 1.3% of the nominal exposure time ( 3.2  s ) .",
    "this results in 1.3% of the source flux being uniformly re - distributed into a strip spanning the entire ccd along the readout direction , creating a `` readout artifact '' .",
    "this effect must be accounted when the readout artifact from the bright , central region contaminates the low surface brightness cluster outskirts .",
    "fortunately , the readout artifact for sources without pile - up can be subtracted almost precisely , using a technique proposed by @xcite .",
    "a new dataset is generated with the ` chipy`-coordinate of all the photons in the original observation randomized , and their sky coordinates and energies recalculated as if it were a normal observation .",
    "the obtained dataset is normalized by the ratio @xmath44 and treated as an additional background observation .",
    "the normalization of the blank - field background is reduced by the same 1.3% to account for this subtraction .",
    "this correction was applied for all our clusters .",
    "the cluster spectra were extracted in annuli centered on the x - ray surface brightness peak , separately for each pointing and for fi and bi ccds .",
    "the radial boundaries were chosen so that @xmath45 except for a262 where the statistical accuracy was sufficient to measure temperatures in narrower annuli , @xmath46 .",

    "typical scatter of the background normalization is included in our temperature uncertainties .",
    "the accuracy of the background subtraction can be verified directly for several clusters with small angular size that we observed in acis - i , such as a383 and a907 , because a sufficient fraction of the acis field of view is free from cluster emission in these cases .",

    "<S> we present _ chandra _ gas temperature profiles at large radii for a sample of 13 nearby , relaxed galaxy clusters and groups , which includes a133 , a262 , a383 , a478 , a907 , a1413 , a1795 , a1991 , a2029 , a2390 , mkw4 , rxj1159 + 5531 , and usgc s152 . the sample covers a range of average temperatures from 1 to 10 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters are selected from the archive or observed by us to have sufficient exposures and off - center area coverage to enable accurate background subtraction and reach the temperature accuracy of better than 2030% at least to @xmath0 , and for the three best clusters , to @xmath1 . for all clusters , </S>",
    "<S> we find cool gas in the cores , outside of which the temperature reaches a peak at @xmath2 and then declines to @xmath3 of its peak value at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when the profiles are scaled by the cluster average temperature ( excluding cool cores ) and the estimated virial radius , they show large scatter at small radii , but remarkable similarity at @xmath5 for all but one cluster ( a2390 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with previous measurements from _ asca _ by markevitch et al .  and from _ beppo - sax _ by degrandi & molendi . </S>",
    "<S> four clusters have recent _ xmm - newton _ temperature profiles , two of which agree with our results , and we discuss reasons for disagreement for the other two . </S>",
    "<S> the overall shape of temperature profiles at large radii is reproduced in recent cosmological simulations . </S>"
