    "direct measurement of the mass of a supermassive black hole ( bh ) in the center of a galaxy generally requires spatially resolved observations of tracer particles close enough to the bh that their orbits are dominated , or at least heavily influenced , by the gravitational potential of the bh .",
    "the `` gold standards '' of bh mass determinations are measurements for the milky way s bh based on resolved stellar orbits @xcite and for the bh in ngc 4258 based on motions of h@xmath5o megamasers resolved by very long - baseline interferometry @xcite .",
    "there are two primary factors that make these the best measurements of bh masses .",
    "first , the observations are able to resolve kinematics at such small scales that the gravitational potential is overwhelmingly dominated by the bh itself .",
    "second , the observations are able to measure the kinematics of individual test particles in orbit about the bh , rather than the combined and blended kinematics of a population of tracers having different orbital trajectories .    aside from the special cases of the milky way , ngc 4258 , and a small number of other megamaser disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of the @xmath6 dynamical detections of bhs come from observations and modeling of spatially resolved stellar or gas kinematics , mostly from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) or large ground - based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics ; for a review of methods and results see @xcite . due to the limitations of angular resolution , these observations do not isolate individual test particles ; rather , they rely on the combined line - of sight kinematics of stars in the galaxy s bulge , or of gas clouds in a rotating disk , in both cases modified by the blurring effect of the instrumental point - spread function .",
    "the stellar - dynamical method is most widely applicable , in that stars are always present as dynamical tracers in galaxy nuclei , but the construction of orbit - based dynamical models is a formidable challenge .",
    "models have recently evolved toward greater complexity due to a growing recognition that the derived bh masses can be sensitive to the treatment of the dark matter halo @xcite , triaxial structure @xcite , and stellar mass - to - light ratio gradients in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "measurements of bh mass from ionized gas kinematics are conceptually and technically simpler since the method relies on modeling circular rotation of a thin disk rather than modeling the full stellar orbital structure of an entire galaxy , and early measurements done with _",
    "spectroscopy demonstrated the potential of this technique @xcite .",
    "in contrast to stellar dynamics , the dynamics of a thin circular disk at small radii are relatively insensitive to the galaxy s dark matter halo or to stellar mass - to - light gradients . however , ionized gas - dynamical measurements suffer from a separate and significant set of systematic uncertainties",
    ". ionized gas disks often have a substantial turbulent velocity dispersion ( @xmath7 ) , sometimes up to hundreds of km  s@xmath2  @xcite , which must be accounted for in modeling the disk dynamics . in some cases",
    ", the dynamical effect of this turbulence can affect the estimated bh mass at the factor of @xmath8 level compared with masses inferred from thin disk modeling if turbulent pressure support is neglected .",
    "incorporating turbulent pressure support has been done using approximations based on point - particle dynamics , either by applying the formalism of asymmetric drift @xcite or by applying the jeans equation to model a kinematically hot , vertically extended rotating disk @xcite .",
    "these methods are not intrinsically well - suited to gas - dynamical systems , but more rigorous approaches are still lacking .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainty is the extended mass distribution of stars : when the bh s gravitational radius of influence ( @xmath9 ; the radius within which @xmath10 ) is not highly resolved , errors in determination of the stellar mass profile can strongly impact the accuracy of @xmath11  measurements . in many gas - dynamical measurements done with _",
    ", @xmath9  has been just marginally resolved , and only in the very best cases such as m87 @xcite is @xmath9  so highly resolved that the bh dominates the mass profile at the smallest observed scales .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the very optically thick dust present in most gas - dynamical targets , which impedes the measurement of the intrinsic stellar luminosity profile . despite much early enthusiasm and a large number of _ hst _  orbits invested in the method , ionized gas dynamics",
    "has not produced a very large number of robust bh masses , in part due to the fact that many galaxies targeted for _ hst _  observations did not exhibit clean rotational kinematics in the circumnuclear gas @xcite .    in some galaxies ,",
    "near - infrared ro - vibrational h@xmath5 emission lines from circumnuclear disks of warm molecular gas can be detected . with adaptive optics ,",
    "it is possible to map the kinematics of h@xmath5 disks at high resolution and constrain bh masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the warm molecular gas in active galactic nuclei often appears to be somewhat kinematically disturbed or irregular , even when the gas is in overall rotation about the bh @xcite , and it has not generally been possible to derive highly precise constraints on bh masses using it as a tracer .",
    "cold molecular gas has the potential to emerge as an important new dynamical tracer for bh mass measurement , enabled largely by the recent construction of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "the basic principles of bh mass measurement via molecular gas dynamics are essentially identical to those used for ionized gas - dynamical measurements , but cold molecular gas offers several key advantages in terms of the physical structure of circumnuclear disks and the practical aspects of carrying out a dynamical measurement .",
    "similar to ionized gas disks , the dynamics of rotating molecular disks close to and within @xmath9  are essentially unaffected by the host galaxy s large - scale dark matter halo or possible triaxial structure , thus avoiding two of the most significant uncertainties associated with stellar - dynamical bh detection in early - type galaxies ( etgs ) .",
    "crucially , cold molecular gas tends to have a smaller turbulent velocity dispersion than the ionized gas in the same galaxy , making it a better tracer of the circular velocity @xcite and more amenable to accurate dynamical modeling .",
    "about 10% of etgs contain well - defined , regular , flat , and round circumnuclear dust disks that can be seen easily in _ hst",
    "_  images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in cases where",
    "these disks have associated ionized components , they have been targets for gas - dynamical bh mass measurements with _ hst _ , but some dust disks have very weak or undetectable optical line emission .",
    "the optical morphology can provide a clear indication of dense gas in rotation about the galaxy center , and such disks are potentially the best and most promising targets for measurement of bh masses with alma .",
    "pre - alma co observations of molecular gas disks in etgs illustrated that well - defined , round dust disks are generally associated with regular , circular rotation in the molecular gas , although interferometric observations were not generally able to probe angular scales as small as @xmath9  in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first proof of concept for bh mass measurement via co kinematics was presented by @xcite , who used the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) to observe ngc 4526 at 025 resolution , just sufficient to resolve @xmath9 .",
    "alma now offers the possibility of routinely carrying out molecular - line observations that resolve @xmath9 , opening up a major new avenue for determination of bh masses in galaxy nuclei .    while it has long been anticipated that alma will enable bh mass measurements based on spatially resolved molecular - line kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not yet clear how widely applicable this new method will prove to be .",
    "the potential of the method depends crucially on the ability to identify targets having cleanly rotating gas within @xmath9 , with a high enough surface brightness for molecular line emission on these scales to be detected and mapped in reasonable exposure times . in alma cycle 2 , we began a program of observations of etgs in order to pursue the goal of obtaining bh mass measurements .",
    "the first stage of this program involves observations of the co(21 ) line at @xmath12 resolution to search for evidence of rapid rotation within the bh sphere of influence .",
    "targets were selected based on the presence of well - defined , round circumnuclear dust disks as seen in _ hst _",
    "images . for galaxies showing regularly rotating disks with high - velocity co emission from within @xmath9 , deeper and higher - resolution observations can then be proposed in order to obtain highly precise measurements of @xmath11 .",
    "a total of seven etgs were observed in our cycle 2 programs , and observations for the full sample will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "here , we present the first results from this project , an examination of the circumnuclear disk kinematics in ngc 1332 .",
    "ngc 1332 is an s0 or e galaxy with a bulge stellar velocity dispersion of 328 km  s@xmath2  ( for a detailed description of its morphology and classification see * ? ? ?",
    "it contains a highly inclined and opaque circumnuclear dust disk that is visible in _ hst _  images .",
    "the bh mass in ngc 1332 has previously been measured using two different techniques .",
    "@xcite found @xmath13 @xmath4  ( at 68% confidence ) from stellar - dynamical modeling of vlt adaptive - optics data .",
    "@xcite modeled the hydrostatic equilibrium of the x - ray emitting gas in ngc 1332 using data from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and derived a smaller central mass of @xmath14 @xmath4  ( at 90% confidence ) .",
    "the discrepancy between these two measurements provides additional motivation to attempt to measure @xmath11  via molecular gas dynamics .",
    "while the nearly edge - on disk inclination makes ngc 1332 a challenging target for gas - dynamical studies , it is a rare example of a galaxy that can serve as a test case for comparison of three independent methods to measure its bh mass , making it a compelling target for alma observations . following the detection of co emission from within @xmath9  in these cycle 2 data , higher - resolution ( 004 ) observations of ngc 1332",
    "have been approved for alma s cycle 3 .",

    "this resolution is sufficient to resolve the bh s radius of influence if @xmath15 @xmath4 .",

    "we adopt a distance of 22.3 mpc for consistency with @xcite , while @xcite used a slightly smaller distance of 21.3 mpc .",
    "as part of program 2013.1.0229.s , alma observed ngc 1332 on 2014 september 1 in a frequency band centered on the redshifted @xmath17co(2 - 1 ) 230.538 ghz line at @xmath18 ghz ( in alma band 6 ) .",
    "the minimum and maximum baselines of the array were 33.7 m and 1.1 km , respectively , and the on - source integration time was 22.7 min .",

    "use of briggs weighting with robustness parameter 0.5 yields a synthesized beam with major and minor axis fwhm sizes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 and major axis position angle 784 , giving a geometric mean resolution of 027 corresponding to 29.2 pc in ngc 1332 .",
    "the data cube contains 60 frequency channels with spacing 15.4 mhz , or velocity spacing 20.1 km  s@xmath2  relative to the frequency of the co(21 ) line at the ngc 1332 systemic velocity .",
    "the rms noise level as measured in line - free regions of the data cube is 0.4 mjy beam@xmath2  per channel .",
    "the overall flux scale for the data was set by an observation of the quasar j0334@xmath224008 , for which we adopt a 10% uncertainty ( see , e.g. , the appendix of * ? ? ?",

    "line emission is visible in 52 channels in the data cube , spanning a full velocity width of 1040 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "figure [ hstalmafig ] shows the alma co image of ngc 1332 , summed over all frequency channels of the data cube .",
    "co emission originates from a region corresponding closely to the optically thick dust disk with 22 angular radius , as seen in an archival _ hst _",

    "the continuum image reveals a marginally resolved source at the disk center with flux density @xmath25 mjy ; we assume an additional 10% uncertainty in this value based on the uncertainty in the overall flux calibration .",
    "figure [ lineprofilefig ] illustrates the integrated co emission profile over this region , which exhibits a symmetric double - horned shape with peaks separated by 840 km  s@xmath2 . to examine the spatially resolved kinematics , we fit the line profile at each spatial pixel using a sixth - order gauss - hermite function @xcite .",
    "the s / n was sufficient to obtain successful fits at each pixel over an elliptical region having major and minor axis lengths of 43 and 07 . outside this region ,",
    "the co flux drops rapidly to below the level of the noise .",
    "figure [ momentmaps ] shows the spatially resolved kinematic moment maps for the line - of - sight velocity centroid ( @xmath26 , measured relative to the systemic velocity ) , the dispersion @xmath27 , and the higher - order gauss - hermite moments @xmath28 through @xmath29 .",
    "the odd - numbered moments @xmath28 and @xmath30 describe asymmetric departures from a gaussian profile , while the even - numbered moments @xmath31 and @xmath29 quantify symmetric deviations from a gaussian shape .",
    "the @xmath26  map illustrates the fact that the ngc 1332 disk is in orderly rotation overall .",
    "beam smearing of the disk s velocity field is particularly severe given the disk s nearly edge - on inclination . at 03 resolution ,",
    "the disk s projected semi - minor axis is essentially unresolved , and low - velocity emission `` piles up '' into the line profiles along the disk major axis .",
    "consequently , high - velocity emission from gas in rotation near the disk center is spatially blended with a substantial amount of low - velocity emission from foreground and background regions along the disk surface .",
    "the @xmath26  map for ngc 1332 shows a relatively steep velocity gradient across the nucleus from the southeastern ( redshifted ) to northwestern ( blueshifted ) side of the disk , but without central high - velocity emission .",
    "high - velocity emission is present near the disk center , but as a sub - dominant contribution to the line profiles .",
    "the primary signature of the disk s central rise in rotation speed is in the @xmath28 map , which shows very strong blueward and redward asymmetries on opposite sides of the disk center .",
    "the @xmath27  map has an `` x '' shape typical of inclined rotating disks , with peak line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath32 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this `` x '' shape comes from rotational broadening and beam smearing in regions of the disk exhibiting a steep gradient in line - of - sight velocity .",
    "it is also possible that a portion of the spatial variation in observed line width could be due to a radial gradient in the disk s intrinsic turbulent velocity dispersion , but dynamical modeling is required to distinguish the separate contributions of beam smearing and turbulent velocity gradients .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath29 maps are noisy but still contain coherent structure tracing the same features as @xmath28 and @xmath31 .",
    "to examine the kinematic position angle ( pa ) as a function of radius in the disk , we used the kinemetry method of @xcite , applying kinemetry to the measured @xmath26  map .",
    "the kinemetry routine fits a harmonic expansion to @xmath26  along elliptical annuli .",
    "its output includes , at each semi - major axis distance @xmath33 , the kinematic position angle @xmath34 , the axis ratio @xmath35 of the kinematic ellipse , the first harmonic coefficient @xmath36 ( equivalent to the major axis line - of - sight velocity amplitude ) , and the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 coefficient quantifies deviations from pure rotation , and the presence of strong features in the @xmath37 map can indicate the existence of multiple kinematic components .",
    "the kinematic pa @xmath34 refers to the kinematic major axis and is defined here such that pa=0  would correspond to a north - south orientation for the disk major axis with the northern side of the disk redshifted .",
    "we use the term kinematic major axis to refer to the locus of points of maximum line - of - sight velocity amplitude on each elliptical annulus , which is equivalent to the line of nodes for an inclined , flat circular disk seen in projection .",
    "the kinematic minor axis refers to the locus of points at which @xmath26  is equal to the systemic velocity @xmath39 . in a flat circular disk ,",
    "the kinematic major and minor axes will be seen as orthogonal straight lines on the sky , but in the presence of warping , radial flows , or elliptical orbits , this is in general no longer the case .",
    "( see wong , blitz , & bosma 2004 for a detailed discussion of the observable signatures of noncircular or warped kinematics in gaseous disks . )    as described by @xcite , galaxies having multiple kinematic components are typically characterized by either abrupt changes in @xmath35 or @xmath34 ( with @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) , or a double - peaked @xmath36 profile , or the presence of a distinct peak in the @xmath38 profile at which @xmath37 > 0.02 .",
    "a kinematic twist is identified if @xmath34 varies smoothly with radius with a rotation of @xmath42 .",
    "the kinemetry results are shown in figure [ fig : kinemetry ] .",
    "the kinematic pa @xmath34 ranges from 128  at @xmath43 ( within one resolution element of the galaxy nucleus ) to 117  at the outer edge of the disk , which can be characterized as a mild kinematic twist .",
    "the @xmath37 ratio is below 0.02 at all radii and does not contain any strong features .",
    "overall , the modest radial variation in @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the flat @xmath37 profile with magnitude of @xmath44 , indicate that the ngc 1332 disk kinematics are consistent with coherent disk rotation as the dominant kinematic structure .",
    "if @xmath9  were well resolved , @xmath36 would exhibit a central quasi - keplerian ( @xmath45 ) decline with increasing distance from the nucleus , but instead we see a smooth monotonic rise in @xmath36 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "this is an indication that @xmath26  does not in itself provide direct evidence for a compact central mass ; beam smearing hides the central high - velocity emission in the higher - order velocity moment maps .",
    "we also extract a position - velocity diagram ( pvd ) as another method to visualize the kinematics .",
    "we constructed the pvd by rotating each frequency slice of the data cube clockwise by 27  so that the kinematic pa at the largest measured radius was oriented horizontally , and then extracting a four - pixel wide swath through the data cube ( corresponding to one resolution element ) along the disk major axis .",
    "figure [ pvdfig ] shows the pvd , which illustrates a smooth and continuous distribution of emission across the full range of velocities present in the disk .",
    "the central high - velocity emission is clearly seen in the form of a slight upturn in the locus of maximum line - of - sight speed on either side of the nucleus .",
    "this central velocity upturn is relatively faint and only seen within @xmath46 of the nucleus , it only spans 34 velocity channels above the level of the flat outer envelope in rotation velocity , and it is spatially blended with a much larger amount of emission spanning the entire velocity range present in the disk .",
    "this pvd structure may be contrasted with the case of an observation in which @xmath9  is well resolved : in that situation , the central velocity upturn would be seen as a narrow locus of emission , rather than as the outer envelope of a broad distribution of velocities extending down to zero . nevertheless , the velocity rise seen within the innermost @xmath47 is the expected signature of a compact central massive object that dominates the gravitational potential at small radii .",
    "although the co surface brightness map shows a central dip in brightness within the innermost @xmath48 , the observed velocity structure provides evidence that the intrinsic co - emitting region extends to scales within the black hole s sphere of influence .    from the pvd",
    ", we can extract an estimate of the enclosed gravitating mass within one resolution element of the galaxy nucleus . at a distance of four pixels ( 028 ) from the galaxy center , corresponding to @xmath49 pc , the maximum velocity seen in the pvd is @xmath50 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if this maximum velocity is equated with the circular speed at @xmath49 pc , the implied enclosed mass is @xmath51 @xmath4 , which can then be taken as an upper limit to @xmath11  since it includes both the bh and the stellar mass enclosed within this radius .",
    "a caveat to this simple estimate is that the co line profiles may be broadened by turbulence in the molecular gas disk , in which case the outermost velocity envelope seen in the pvd would give an upper limit to the line - of - sight circular velocity .",
    "the pvd structure also helps to clarify why the integrated co line profile in figure [ lineprofilefig ] is so strongly double peaked .",
    "the flat outer velocity envelope to the pvd at @xmath52 indicates that the galaxy s rotation curve is fairly flat over this range of radii . as a result",
    ", there is a large amount of co emission at line - of - sight velocities in a narrow range around @xmath53 km  s@xmath2  from gas along the disk s major axis .",
    "the total co(2 - 1 ) flux of the disk is @xmath54 jy km  s@xmath2 , with an additional 10% uncertainty in the flux scale .",
    "we can use this flux value to obtain an estimate of the total molecular gas mass of the disk by applying a co - to - h@xmath5 conversion factor @xmath55 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , we convert from observed flux to luminosity to obtain @xmath56 k km  s@xmath2  pc@xmath57 .",
    "the co - to - h@xmath5 conversion is most reliably calibrated in terms of the luminosity of the co(10 ) emission line , which we do not have for ngc 1332 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume an intensity ratio @xmath58 .",
    "for the sample of 18 etgs studied by @xcite , the median co intensity ratio is @xmath59 with standard deviation of 0.23 , consistent with our adopted value of 0.7 .",
    "then , a standard value of @xmath60 @xmath4  pc@xmath61  ( k km  s@xmath2)@xmath2  derived for nearby galaxies and including a factor of 1.36 correction for helium @xcite leads to an estimated molecular gas mass of @xmath62 @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite find that within the central kpc of galaxies , @xmath63  is typically a factor of @xmath8 below this adopted standard value , however , and in some cases the value of @xmath63  in galaxy centers is an order of magnitude lower than the average .",
    "if this trend applies to etgs as well , then the actual gas mass in the disk could be several times lower than this simple estimate .",
    "the circumnuclear disk of ngc 1332 may have physical conditions very different from the environments in which @xmath63  has been calibrated , and in regions of high density and high optical depth the standard assumptions of the co - to - h@xmath5 conversion method may be invalid @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the gas mass derived above as merely a rough estimate .",
    "we modeled the kinematics of a flat circular disk following the same approach used for ionized gas disks observed with _",
    "hst _  @xcite .",
    "the calculation begins with a mass model consisting of the central point mass @xmath11  and the extended mass profile of stars in the host galaxy @xmath64 , representing the mass enclosed within radius @xmath65 .",
    "the mass profile @xmath64 is determined from an empirically measured and deprojected luminosity profile , with the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath66  as a free parameter .",
    "we neglect the possible contribution of dark matter , which is expected to be extremely small relative to stellar mass on scales comparable to the circumnuclear disk radius .",
    "the mass model of ngc 1332 from @xcite indicates a total enclosed dark matter mass of @xmath67 @xmath4  within @xmath68 pc , two orders of magnitude lower than the stellar mass enclosed at this scale . our model does not include the mass of the gas disk itself , since our estimate of the total molecular gas mass is @xmath69 @xmath4  within @xmath68 pc .",
    "a circular , flat disk in rotation about the galaxy center has rotation speed given by @xmath70^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath71 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity at each point in the model disk is then determined for a given inclination angle @xmath72 and a major axis orientation angle @xmath34 ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model is constructed on a spatial grid that is highly oversampled relative to the alma spatial pixel size , because a given pixel near the disk center can contain gas spanning a substantial velocity range . in the models ,",
    "each alma pixel is subdivided into an @xmath73 grid of sub - pixel elements . at each sub - pixel element in the grid , we model the emergent line profile as a gaussian , with central velocity given by the projected rotation velocity at that point , and with some turbulent linewidth @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss the possible radial variation of @xmath7  in  [ sec : turbmodel ] .",
    "the line profiles at each location must be weighted by the co surface brightness at the corresponding point in the disk .",
    "the available information on the co surface brightness distribution of the disk is simply the velocity - integrated co image as shown in figure [ hstalmafig ] .",
    "however , this is an image of the disk modified by beam smearing , and the model requires an image of the intrinsic surface brightness distribution .",
    "ideally one would want a co surface brightness map at the same resolution as the @xmath73 sub - pixel sampling of the model grid , but such information is not available .",
    "lacking knowledge of the co surface brightness distribution on subpixel scales , the line profiles at each sub - pixel grid point contributing to a given alma spatial pixel were normalized to have equal fluxes .",
    "then , the subsampled data cube was rebinned to the spatial pixel scale of the alma data by averaging each @xmath73 set of sub - pixel line profiles to form a single profile .",
    "the line profiles are calculated on a grid of 20.1 km s@xmath2",
    "pixel@xmath2 , corresponding to the velocity sampling of the alma data cube .    in order to scale the line profile of each spatial pixel to its appropriate flux level",
    ", we used a deconvolved co surface brightness map .",
    "we deconvolved the co image shown in figure [ hstalmafig ] using five iterations of the richardson - lucy algorithm @xcite implemented in iraf , where the deconvolution was carried out with an elliptical gaussian point - spread function ( psf ) matching the specifications of the alma synthesized beam .",
    "the choice of five iterations of the deconvolution algorithm is somewhat arbitrary : this produced an adequately sharpened image , and larger numbers of iterations began to produce noticeable artifacts by amplifying background noise . in the model calculation , the line profile at each pixel was then normalized to match the flux at the corresponding pixel in the deconvolved flux map . to allow for any possible mismatch in flux normalization between the deconvolved flux map and the original alma data cube , we multiply the flux map by a scaling factor @xmath74  that is a free parameter in the model fits . in practice",
    ", the best - fitting value of @xmath74  is very close to unity .",
    "each frequency slice of the modeled cube is then convolved with the alma synthesized beam , modeled as an elliptical gaussian , producing a simulated data cube analogous to the alma data .",
    "since we rebin the high - resolution model cube to the alma pixel resolution prior to carrying out the psf convolution , there is little time penalty for carrying out the initial computation of line profiles on an oversampled pixel grid with @xmath75 as high as 10 , and it is feasible to carry out model optimizations with the line profiles computed at much finer spatial sampling ( @xmath76 for example ) .",
    "psf convolution is often the most time - consuming step of gas - dynamical model calculations , particularly if the convolution is carried out on an oversampled pixel grid .",
    "free parameters in the model include @xmath11  and @xmath66 , the @xmath77 and @xmath78 centroid positions of the bh , the systemic velocity @xmath39 , the inclination and orientation angles of the disk @xmath72 and @xmath34 , the flux - normalization factor @xmath74  applied to the co flux map , and the parameters describing the run of @xmath7  as a function of radius in the disk ( see  [ sec : turbmodel ] ; this requires up to three parameters depending on the choice of @xmath7  model ) .",
    "the stellar mass profile @xmath64 is an essential ingredient in the dynamical modeling , and is determined by measuring and deprojecting the galaxy s surface brightness profile .",
    "ideally , this should be measured from imaging data having angular resolution at least as high as the spectroscopic data .",
    "near - infrared observations are strongly preferred , especially for galaxies having dusty nuclei .",
    "the only available _ hst _  image of ngc 1332 is the wfpc2 f814w image shown in figure [ hstalmafig ] , and the dust disk is extremely optically thick in the @xmath23 band .",
    "@xcite used a combination of seeing - limited @xmath33-band data on large scales , and @xmath79-band ao data on small scales ( @xmath80 ) , to measure the stellar luminosity profile of ngc 1332 ; they masked out the central dust disk in extracting the galaxy s light profile .",
    "their model was then deprojected under the assumption of axisymmetric structure and an inclination of 90 .",
    "we used this same mass profile ( kindly provided by j.  thomas ) in order to carry out a direct comparison between our gas - dynamical modeling and the stellar - dynamical results of @xcite .",
    "the version of the mass profile provided ( which we denote @xmath81 ) was the average of the best - fitting stellar - dynamical models over the four quadrants of the vlt integral - field kinematic data , and corresponds to a stellar mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath33 band of @xmath82 . in our models , we incorporated this mass profile directly , multiplied by a mass - to - light scaling factor @xmath83 ( a free parameter in the model fits ) , such that @xmath84 and the resulting mass - to - light ratio is @xmath85 . as described below , our best fits converged on values of @xmath83 very close to unity , indicating that our gas - dynamical model fitting finds close agreement with the stellar mass distribution measured by @xcite .",
    "as a consistency check , we also measured a stellar luminosity profile from the archival _ hst _  data .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "observation was taken as two individual 320 s exposures with the galaxy nucleus on the pc chip of the wfpc2 camera ( 00456 arcsec pixel@xmath2 ) , and we combined the two exposures using the iraf / stsdas task ` crrej ` .",
    "we measured the galaxy s surface brightness profile from the pc image , first masking point sources , globular clusters , and the dust disk .",
    "the disk was masked over the radial range 0123 .",
    "the central four pixels , where dust extinction appears less severe , were retained in order to anchor the radial profile measurement at the galaxy s nucleus , but the measurement then gives a lower limit to the central surface brightness due to dust extinction along the nuclear line of sight .",
    "the surface brightness profile was fit using a 2d multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) using the ` mge_fit_sectors ` package @xcite , using eight gaussian components .",
    "the mge expansion requires a psf model , and we modeled the pc f814w psf using an mge fit to a synthetic psf generated using tiny tim @xcite .",
    "deprojection of the mge model was done assuming that the galaxy bulge is an oblate spheroid with inclination 83  ( based on fits to the alma kinematics described below ) .",
    "ccd counts were converted to @xmath23-band solar units accounting for a galactic foreground extinction of @xmath86 mag @xcite to give the @xmath23-band luminosity profile @xmath87 .",
    "the mass profile is then given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the @xmath23-band mass - to - light ratio .",
    "figure [ massprofiles ] shows the enclosed stellar mass profile @xmath64 from @xcite and the profile measured from the _ hst _",
    "f814w image .",
    "in both cases , the mass - to - light ratio normalization is based on the best - fitting result for models assuming a spatially uniform value of @xmath7 , as described in  [ sec : turbmodel ] .",
    "the @xmath23-band stellar mass profile implies a lower stellar mass than the @xmath33+@xmath79 band profile from @xcite .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that this mass deficit is the result of dust absorption by the circumnuclear disk in the @xmath23-band _ hst _  image , which could not be entirely masked out .",
    "we therefore choose to use the @xcite profile for our final model fits . at the outer edge of the disk at @xmath90 pc ,",
    "the enclosed stellar mass reaches @xmath91 @xmath4 , so the bh is expected to make a small contribution to the total enclosed mass at this scale .      to model the co line profiles",
    ", some assumption must be made regarding the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "the thermal contribution to the linewidth for cold molecular gas will be extremely small : @xcite find kinetic temperatures of typically @xmath92 k for molecular gas in etg disks .",
    "ideally , with angular resolution high enough to resolve individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) within the disk , the turbulent velocity dispersion of individual gmcs can be measured . in a range of environments ,",
    "the highest linewidths observed in individual gmcs correspond to @xmath93 km  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the closest analog to ngc 1332 having observations of high enough resolution to isolate individual gmcs is ngc 4526 , where co(21 ) observations from carma were able to resolve 103 individual gmcs @xcite . in ngc 4526 ,",
    "most of the individual gmcs were found to have @xmath94 km  s@xmath2 , and the highest - dispersion clouds have @xmath95 km  s@xmath2 . for ngc 1332 ,",
    "the 03 resolution of our alma data shows a very smooth distribution of co emission across the disk surface , and much higher angular resolution would be required in order to identify individual clouds within the disk or measure their velocity dispersions directly .    in the outer regions of the ngc 1332 disk , the co emission profiles are very narrow .",
    "at the largest radii along the disk major axis , the lines are unresolved as observed in the 20 km  s@xmath2  velocity channels , with measured linewidths of @xmath96 km  s@xmath2  from the gauss - hermite fits . toward the inner regions of the disk , the linewidths",
    "rise to a maximum of @xmath97 km  s@xmath2 , with the largest widths observed at locations about 0304 on either side of the nucleus along the disk major axis .",
    "in this central region , the line profiles are extremely asymmetric with broad , extended wings . as will be shown below , most or all of this rise in observed linewidth can be explained by beam smearing of unresolved rotation .",
    "there remains the possibility , however , of a genuine increase in the gas turbulent velocity dispersion toward the disk center .",
    "one issue in the model construction is that if the pixel oversampling factor @xmath75 is too low , the models can have a tendency to require a spuriously high value of @xmath98 to compensate for inadequate spatial sampling of rotational velocity gradients .",
    "it is crucial , therefore , to ensure that the models are computed on a grid with sufficient spatial sampling that @xmath7  is not biased toward higher values than actually occur in the disk .",
    "if the molecular gas in the ngc 1332 disk is arranged in unresolved discrete clouds then the co line width from an individual cloud is the result of the internal turbulent velocity dispersion within the cloud , rotation of the cloud as a whole , and shear due to galactic differential rotation .",
    "additionally , random motions of clouds ( either in - plane or vertical ) will contribute to the observed line widths .",
    "since our observations do not resolve individual clouds , our data can not distinguish among these contributions , and we use the term `` turbulence '' to refer to the combination of all processes responsible for the emergent line width from a given location at the disk surface . in their study of the ngc 4526 gmc population , @xcite found that the energy in turbulent motion dominated over internal rotational energy for nearly all of the resolved clouds .    to explore how the model fits",
    "depend on the assumed turbulent velocity dispersion profile and allow for possible radial gradients in turbulence , we ran models using the following prescriptions for @xmath99 .    _",
    "flat : _ the simplest parameterization is @xmath7  = constant , allowing @xmath7  to be a free parameter in the model fits .",
    "_ exponential : _ following a typical prescription used in ionized gas dynamics , we used a model of the form @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are free parameters .",
    "model fits consistently drove the value of @xmath102 to zero , so this parameter was discarded from final fits . to prevent the line profile widths from becoming arbitrarily narrow , we enforced a minimum value of @xmath104 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "_ gaussian : _ the largest observed linewidths are seen at locations slightly offset from the disk center , suggesting that a @xmath7  model with a central depression could provide a better fit to the data . as a simple model allowing for a central plateau or dip in @xmath7 , we used a gaussian profile : @xmath105 + \\sigma_1 $ ] , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath106 are free parameters .",
    "again , we found that model fits drove @xmath102 to zero and we removed this parameter from the final model runs , and enforced a minimum value of @xmath107 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath103 was allowed to vary over positive and negative values for maximum freedom in fitting the data .",
    "positive values were preferred by the fits , producing a central dip in the turbulent velocity dispersion .",
    "in  [ sec : results ] , we present a comparison of model fitting results using each of these parameterizations for @xmath7 . we emphasize that none of these prescriptions for @xmath7  represents a physically motivated model .",
    "the disk s actual @xmath7  profile could be considerably different from any of these prescriptions ( and might not be axisymmetric ) , but the data do not provide sufficient information to justify modeling @xmath7  with anything much more complex than these simple parameterizations .",
    "the output of each model computation for a given parameter set is a simulated data cube having the same spatial and velocity sampling as the alma data .",
    "thus , the models can be fitted directly to the alma data cube to optimize the fit by @xmath108  minimization .",
    "we fit models using the ` amoeba ` downhill simplex method implemented in idl",
    ".    for model fits to the observed data cube , we fit models only to the spatial pixels within the elliptical region illustrated in figure [ momentmaps ] , using 52 frequency channels at each spatial pixel spanning the full width of the co emission line . to determine @xmath108  by direct comparison of the modeled cube with the data , an estimate is required for the flux uncertainty at each pixel in the data .",
    "the simplest way to estimate the noise level would be to determine the standard deviation of pixel values in emission - free regions of the data cube .",
    "however , the background noise in the data exhibits strong correlations among neighboring pixels , on angular scales similar to the synthesized beam size .",
    "a proper calculation of @xmath108  in the presence of strongly correlated errors requires the computation and inversion of the covariance matrix of the data uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we attempted to construct a covariance matrix by using `` blank '' , emission - free regions of the data cube to determine the pixel - to - pixel correlations in the background noise . within the elliptical fitting region ,",
    "there are 523 individual spatial pixels .",
    "we found that numerical errors in constructing and inverting the covariance matrix rendered the @xmath108  calculation highly unstable .",
    "we then opted for a simplified approach to computing @xmath108 .",
    "the background noise correlations are strong on scales comparable to the synthesized beam , of size @xmath12 , while the pixel size is 007 .",
    "we rebinned the data by spatially averaging the flux over @xmath109 pixel blocks within each frequency channel , yielding approximately one rebinned pixel per synthesized beam .",
    "this process averages over the mottled pattern in the background noise seen at the original pixel resolution , producing a data cube in which the background noise is nearly uncorrelated among neighboring pixels . in this block - averaged data cube",
    ", we measured the standard deviation of pixel values in blank regions to determine the noise level for use in measuring @xmath108 .",
    "the rms noise level in the @xmath109 block - averaged data is 0.3 mjy beam@xmath2  ( compared with 0.4 mjy beam@xmath2  in the original data ) .",
    "the fact that the noise in the block - averaged data is nearly as large as in the full - resolution data ( rather than scaling as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the number of binned pixels ) reflects the strong local correlations in the pixel values of the full - resolution data .",
    "then , for each model iteration , the calculated model at the original alma pixel scale was similarly block - averaged over @xmath109 pixel regions to compare with the block - averaged data . in the rebinned data , we calculate @xmath108  over 49 block - averaged spatial pixels and 52 frequency channels at each pixel , for a total of 2548 data points .",
    "as an initial test to examine the impact of different values of the oversampling factor @xmath75 , we ran fits with models having a flat turbulent velocity dispersion and oversampling factors of @xmath112 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 50 .",
    "all model parameters were free in these initial fits .",
    "figure [ subsampfig ] illustrates the results of varying @xmath75 .",

    "we choose @xmath116 for our final model fits since there appears to be no discernible benefit to using higher values of @xmath75 , while using @xmath117 significantly increases the time for model computation . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the fits converged on @xmath118 @xmath4 , with @xmath119 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath120 .",
    "we also ran a model fit in which @xmath108  was computed using the full - resolution alma data cube and model , rather than the @xmath109 pixel block - averaged version . with @xmath116 ,",
    "the results for the best - fitting parameters were virtually identical to the block - averaged fits : we found best - fit values of @xmath118 @xmath4 , @xmath121 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath122 . in all subsequent models fitted to the data cube",
    ", we apply the @xmath109 block averaging to the data and models when calculating @xmath108  in order to alleviate any possible issues related to correlated errors in the background noise , but the block averaging does not appear to have an appreciable impact on the best - fitting parameter values .      with oversampling fixed to @xmath116 , we ran initial model optimizations for a two - dimensional grid over a range of fixed values of @xmath11  ( from 0 to @xmath123 @xmath4  in increments of @xmath124 @xmath4 ) and @xmath7  ( from 5 to 50 km  s@xmath2  in increments of 5 km  s@xmath2 ) .",

    "however , since @xmath139  is much greater than unity for the best fit , standard @xmath125 intervals are not directly applicable and we do not consider these confidence intervals to be meaningful . if we were to inflate the noise uncertainties by a factor of 2 in order to achieve @xmath140 for the best fit , the @xmath136 interval would correspond to a slightly broader mass range of @xmath141 @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ momentmaps ] illustrates the kinematic moment maps for this model fit , which reproduce the overall features of the observed moment maps reasonably well although there are clearly systematic differences in detail .",
    "the model @xmath28 map approximately matches the sign reversal in @xmath28 seen on either side of the nucleus : the line profiles at small radii have very extended high - velocity tails , while at large radii along the disk major axis the line profiles have extended low - velocity tails .",
    "since the modeled line profiles are assumed to be intrinsically gaussian at each location in the disk before beam smearing , the departures from gaussian profiles in the modeled data cube can only result from blending of line profiles originating from different locations in the disk .",

    "the pvd for this model , shown in figure [ pvdfig - sigmaprofiles ] , helps to illustrate why this model produces a much lower @xmath108  than models with flat @xmath7 . at radii between 1  and 2 ,",
    "the pvd of the exponential @xmath7  model is a much better match to the observed pvd structure than any of the flat @xmath7  models . at the same time",

    "additionally , restricting @xmath101 to low values produces much worse fits overall in comparison with the free @xmath101 fits : for example , when @xmath101 is fixed to 25 km  s@xmath2 , the best fit is found for @xmath126 , with @xmath161 .",
    "this illustrates the most severe problem in fitting models to the ngc 1332 data : once we allow for the possibility of a radial gradient in @xmath7 , the inferred value of @xmath11  is directly dependent upon the assumed upper limit to @xmath7  in the central region of the disk .",
    "there does not appear to be any clear way to circumvent this problem , since the line profiles are so strongly affected by rotational broadening that @xmath7  can not be directly measured or constrained independently of a dynamical model for the disk rotation .",

    "it is also important to note that for the highest values of @xmath7  reached in these models , the thin disk assumption would break down , invalidating the basic premises of our dynamical modeling .",
    "if the disk were actually highly turbulent in its central regions , the turbulent pressure support would have to be accounted for in determining @xmath11 .",

    "we also ran a separate grid of models with the exponential @xmath7  profile and @xmath162 , to test whether the high central @xmath7  values might be the result of insufficient model resolution of the disk s central kinematics at @xmath116 .",
    "the model fitting results were essentially identical to the @xmath116 case .    as an attempt to examine a model in which @xmath7  possesses a radial gradient without a central peak , we ran model fits using the gaussian @xmath7  profile .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that the stellar luminosity profile measured from @xmath79-band data is a more accurate representation of the galaxy structure , having less sensitivity to dust extinction , and the @xmath79-band galaxy profile gives a lower @xmath108  value for the dynamical model fit .",
    "the difference in bh masses measured with the two profiles illustrates the importance of using a mass profile measured from near - ir imaging whenever possible , to minimize the impact of extinction .",
    "higher - resolution kinematic data would also lessen the impact of extinction on the derived @xmath11 ; when the central , nearly keplerian region of the disk is better resolved , the impact of errors in @xmath64 on the derived @xmath11  will become smaller .",
    "another option for model fitting is to carry out fits to the pvd rather than to the full data cube .",
    "this may have an advantage in that the pvd describes the major axis kinematics of the disk , and fitting models to the pvd rather than to the full data cube could have better sensitivity to the central velocity upturn and lead to better constraints on @xmath11 .",
    "however , fits to the pvd would not be able to constrain the disk inclination , kinematic pa , or centroid position as well as fits to the data cube , and these parameters would need to be constrained or fixed .",
    "we carried out a fit to the pvd using the flat @xmath7  model , with the values of @xmath72 , @xmath34 , and the @xmath77 and @xmath78 centroid positions fixed to their best - fitting values from the corresponding fit to the full data cube .",
    "free parameters included @xmath11 , @xmath66 , @xmath7 , @xmath39 , and @xmath74 .",
    "for each model iteration , we extracted a pvd following the same procedures used on the data , with a four pixel extraction width . for the calculation of @xmath108 , we measured the background noise as the standard deviation of pixel values in blank regions of the pvd .",
    "we note that the pvd still exhibits strongly correlated noise among pixels along the position axis over a scale of @xmath171 pixels .",
    "this model run gave best - fitting values of @xmath172 @xmath4 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , in this case fitting to the pvd rather than to the data cube altered the best - fitting value of @xmath11  by just 8% .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the disk is so highly inclined that a 4-pixel wide extraction of the pvd already contains much of the kinematic information of the disk as a whole .",
    "the fits to the full data cube demonstrated that @xmath108  minimization has a tendency to optimize the model fit to the outer disk , with relatively low sensitivity to the small number of pixels in the central velocity upturn region .",
    "we therefore carried out another model run in which @xmath108  was calculated only over a restricted set of pixels in the pvd corresponding to the spatial and velocity region sensitive to the central upturn .",
    "for this model run , we fixed @xmath66  to its best - fitting value from the previous fit to the full pvd , leaving @xmath11 , @xmath7 , @xmath39 , and @xmath74  as free parameters .",
    "the calculation of @xmath108  was carried out only for pixels in the pvd corresponding to @xmath175 and @xmath176 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this model run gave @xmath177 @xmath4  and @xmath178 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "as in the case of fitting to the full pvd , fitting models with @xmath98 restricted to lower values led to higher values of @xmath11  ( but higher @xmath108 ) : enforcing an upper limit of @xmath149 km",
    "s@xmath2  gave @xmath179 @xmath4 .",
    "since the best - fitting @xmath11  values were very similar to the values derived from fits to the full data cube , we conclude that for this dataset there is no clear advantage to fitting models to either the full pvd or to the central high - velocity region of the pvd .",
    "the dynamical model fits do not lead to a definitive determination of @xmath11 , primarily because the inferred value of @xmath11  depends very directly on the specific choice of some parameterized model for @xmath99 or on any upper limit imposed on the value of @xmath99 .",
    "the simplest model , with the flat @xmath7  profile , converges tightly to @xmath126 @xmath4 .",
    "the best - fitting model has @xmath180 , however , and the line profiles shown in figure [ pvdslices ] demonstrate that @xmath108  is dominated by localized regions where the modeled profiles deviate systematically from the data , indicating that the models are failing to capture some essential structure in the disk s velocity field , turbulent velocity dispersion profile , or surface brightness profile . in the outer disk , the observed line profiles are clearly narrower than the best - fitting overall value of @xmath119 km  s@xmath2 , but when @xmath7  is fixed to lower values",
    ", the line profiles at intermediate radii in the disk deviate even more strongly from the data ( also visible in figure [ pvdslices ] ) .",

    "does not alter these results substantially , compared with fits to the full data cube .",
    "the systematic deviations between models and data can also be seen in the kinematic moment maps ( figure [ momentmaps ] ) .",
    "while the models reproduce the overall structure of the kinematic maps reasonably , even up to @xmath30 and @xmath29 , there are obvious differences in detail , which can plausibly be attributed to an inadequate model for the spatial distribution of @xmath7  in the disk .",
    "models in which @xmath7  is allowed to vary with radius give much lower values of @xmath139 , although still well above unity . fits carried out with the exponential and gaussian @xmath7  profiles drive @xmath11  to zero , substituting dispersion for rapid rotation in the inner region of the disk .",
    "these models are formally more successful than the flat @xmath7  models because they fit the outer disk much better while matching the inner high - velocity envelope of the pvd relatively poorly .",
    "the lowest @xmath108  value is found for the gaussian @xmath7  model fit , which gives @xmath183 at @xmath144 .",
    "the appearance of the pvds for the exponential and gaussian @xmath7  models gives a fairly clear indication that the high central dispersions are spurious , however .",
    "these fits imply central values of @xmath7  that are probably unphysically large ( over 250 km  s@xmath2  in the case of the exponential profile ) , but restricting the maximum @xmath7  amplitude to lower values produces significantly worse fits with much higher @xmath108  ( figure [ expsigma-2dgrid ] ) . with the exponential profile , a limit on the maximum value of @xmath7  ( @xmath184 km  s@xmath2 ) based on observations of resolved gmcs in other environments leads to @xmath11  in the range @xmath185 @xmath4 .",
    "these difficulties in constraining @xmath11  appear to be driven by a combination of factors : the models systematically deviate from the data in some locations of the disk by amounts much larger than the observational uncertainties ; the beam - smeared line profiles near the disk center are so broad that the model fits are unable to distinguish clearly between rotation and turbulence as the source of the broadening ; a relatively small number of data pixels are located in spatial and velocity regions of the data cube that are highly sensitive to @xmath11 ; and the s / n in those @xmath11-sensitive pixels is relatively low .",
    "fortunately , the disk inclination and orientation parameters , centroid position , and systemic velocity are well constrained by the model fits , and we obtain consistent values for these parameters regardless of the @xmath7  prescription that is used .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the best - fitting models is consistent with the value of @xmath186 from @xcite . for the models with flat , exponential , and gaussian @xmath7",
    ", we obtain best - fitting values of @xmath187 , 7.94 , and 7.96 , respectively .",
    "the two latter cases should be considered effectively as upper limits on @xmath188 , however , since these model fits converged on @xmath144 .    the flat and exponential @xmath7  models together point to a bh mass that is likely to be in the range @xmath3 @xmath4 , under the assumption that a plausible maximum value for @xmath7  in the inner disk is @xmath189 km  s@xmath2 .",

    ", we are working in the regime where the bh sphere of influence may be marginally resolved , in that the central velocity upturn is visible as the upper envelope to the pvd at small radii , but the central high - velocity rotation is badly blurred with low - velocity emission due to beam smearing and the disk s nearly edge - on inclination .",
    "in essence , @xmath9  appears to be nearly resolved along the disk major axis , but it is badly unresolved along the disk s minor axis .",
    "this makes it difficult to derive strong constraints on @xmath11  from the information contained in the central velocity upturn .",
    "the difficulties in modeling the ngc 1332 disk dynamics described here are particularly acute since the disk is very close to edge - on , but we anticipate that these same issues will arise in any situation in which the bh sphere of influence is not well resolved .",
    "the `` radius of influence '' for bhs is generally defined as the radius within which the bh is the dominant contribution to the galaxy s mass profile . in the absence of a mass model for the galaxy , @xmath9",
    "is taken to be the radius within which the circular velocity due to the gravitational potential of the bh rises above the surrounding bulge velocity dispersion @xmath192 : @xmath193 . since @xmath192  is not spatially constant within a galaxy bulge , and its central value is affected by the bh itself , this definition does not give a uniquely well - defined value of @xmath9 , but it does provide a useful general guideline for the radius that should be resolved in order to detect the dynamical effect of the bh .",
    "the gravitational influence of the bh can be detected at radii beyond @xmath9 , but at progressively larger radii the enclosed mass becomes dominated by stars .",
    "measuring @xmath11  when @xmath9  is unresolved then becomes an exercise in detecting a small fractional contribution to the total gravitating mass on unresolved spatial scales , and the results can be highly susceptible to systematic errors in determination of the stellar mass profile or in other aspects of the model construction .",
    "the criterion of resolving @xmath9  as the minimal requirement for clear detection of the dynamical effect of the bh ignores one crucial factor , highlighted by the ngc 1332 data . along the minor axis of an inclined disk ,",
    "the projected distance from the nucleus to a point at distance @xmath9  from the nucleus is compressed by a factor of @xmath194 .",
    "this is an important effect for highly inclined disks : for ngc 1332 , @xmath195 . in an observation just sufficient to resolve @xmath9  along the disk major axis in ngc 1332 ,",
    "@xmath9  along the disk s projected minor axis would be unresolved by an order of magnitude . in the alma data described here , the poor spatial resolution along the disk s minor axis direction leads directly to severe beam smearing , causing the line profiles to be dominated by low - velocity emission even at small radii along the disk major axis .",
    "our examination of the ngc 1332 disk dynamics suggests that for gas - dynamical bh mass measurements , the key criterion for whether the bh sphere of influence is resolved should be whether @xmath9  is resolved along the disk s projected _ minor _ axis , not along its major axis as is usually assumed . in other words , to ensure that the central velocity upturn is clearly resolved and not severely spatially blended with low - velocity emission , the observations should resolve an angular scale corresponding to @xmath196 . for highly inclined disks such as ngc 1332 ,",
    "the requirements on angular resolution for dynamical detection of bhs are thus much more stringent than for disks at moderate inclination angles .",
    "bh mass measurements from disks observed at very low inclination angles will present a different set of challenges , and will be particularly difficult if @xmath197 is so small that that the line - of - sight component of the disk s rotational velocity is not much larger than the turbulent or random velocities in the disk .",
    "all else being equal , gas - dynamical bh mass measurements will require higher velocity resolution for disks of lower inclination , and higher angular resolution for high inclinations .    to what extent is @xmath9  resolved in ngc 1332 with the cycle 2 alma observation ? assuming @xmath145 @xmath4  and using @xmath198 km  s@xmath2  @xcite , the kinematic definition of the radius of influence gives @xmath199 pc .",
    "this is equivalent to an angular radius of 022 , indicating that the bh radius of influence along the disk major axis would be slightly unresolved .",
    "in contrast , @xmath200 , so the radius of influence is unresolved by an order of magnitude in the minor - axis direction .",

( with @xmath207",
    ", @xmath197 is so close to unity that it can be essentially ignored . ) in the limit of extremely high angular resolution , the @xmath36 curve would closely follow the curve of @xmath208  for the combined mass profile of the bh and stars . as a consequence of beam smearing and the high disk inclination ,",
    "the observed line - of - sight centroid velocity @xmath36 falls far below the actual major - axis @xmath208  profile at nearly all radii in the disk , even at radii significantly larger than one resolution element from the galaxy nucleus .",

    "this analysis further reinforces the conclusion that , although @xmath9  is likely to be nearly resolved along the disk s major axis , the mean or centroid velocities measured at locations along the disk major axis have essentially no sensitivity to @xmath11 .",
    "when the information about @xmath11  is contained primarily in the _ shapes _ of the beam - smeared line profiles rather than in the centroid velocity @xmath26  measured from the line profile at each position , it becomes extremely challenging to derive accurate constraints on @xmath11 .    for our fiducial mass model displayed in figure [ beamsmear ] , the presence of emission out to @xmath1 km  s@xmath2  from the systemic velocity ( as observed in the pvd )",
    "implies that the disk emission extends down to @xmath209 pc , well inside @xmath9  ( provided that this outermost velocity is primarily the result of rotation rather than turbulence ) . the upper limit to the observed rotation speed could be due to the presence of a `` hole '' in the molecular disk at @xmath210 pc , or simply from a central surface brightness at @xmath210 pc too low to detect in this observation .",
    "this scale is well inside the @xmath211 pc angular resolution of our data .",
    "@xcite proposed a new figure of merit for gas - dynamical bh mass measurements as an alternative to the criterion of resolving @xmath9  for planning future observations .",

    "the figure of merit @xmath214 is defined in terms of the confidence level at which @xmath215 can be distinguished from @xmath216 using spatially resolved observations of disk kinematics , if the uncertainty in measured velocity at a given location is @xmath217 .",
    "the appropriate distance @xmath65 to compute this figure of merit is described as the smallest resolvable distance from the galaxy center , corresponding to the telescope s beam size , since this is the radius within which the bh mass is most dominant in the data .",
    "our ngc 1332 data highlight a particular issue with this figure of merit definition . along the disk major axis at a distance of one resolution element from the center in ngc 1332 , beam smearing and rotational broadening make the observed line profiles extremely broad and asymmetric , breaking the one - to - one correspondence between position and line - of - sight rotation velocity that would be observed in data of much higher angular resolution . if @xmath212 is identified with the mean or centroid of the line - of - sight velocity profile , it will be subject to the beam - smearing effect illustrated in figure [ beamsmear ] , in which case @xmath212 can deviate strongly from the disk s intrinsic @xmath218 out to radial scales significantly larger than the angular resolution of the observations .",
    "the definition of @xmath214 does not account for the confounding effects of beam smearing and disk inclination on the line profiles , an effect that becomes increasingly important at higher disk inclinations . because this orientation maximizes the line - of - sight projection of the disk rotation velocity . by this measure",
    ", the figure of merit approach predicts that bh mass measurements would be most accurate for disks oriented exactly edge - on , all else being equal .",

    "we suggest that observations with such low resolution would not generally have the power to constrain @xmath11  accurately .",
    "we propose that the best criterion to plan future observations is simply whether @xmath9  is resolved along the disk s projected minor axis for the anticipated value of @xmath11 .",

    "such high resolution observations will have the capability to fully lift degeneracies between @xmath11 , @xmath66 , and @xmath7 , and yield highly accurate ( and precise ) measurements of @xmath11 . deriving a more rigorous figure of merit criterion for gas - dynamical bh detection would require a comprehensive suite of simulations incorporating beam smearing , to test the impact of angular resolution , disk inclination , s / n , and other parameters on the accuracy of bh mass determination .      in past gas - dynamical measurements of bh masses using _ hst _",
    "data , models were fit to quantities measured from the data , specifically to the line - of - sight velocity at each spatial pixel , and sometimes to the line - of - sight velocity dispersion as well .",

    "however , despite some initial attempts @xcite , direct fitting of modeled line profiles has not proved to be a successful approach for bh mass measurements based on optical emission - line data .",
    "obstacles to direct line - profile fitting for optical data include the blending of multiple emission lines such as h@xmath219  and the [ ] @xmath220 lines , the presence of broad emission - line components blended with the resolved narrow - line emission , and the difficulty of measuring or modeling the emission - line surface brightness profile to sufficiently high accuracy for direct line - profile fitting to succeed .",
    "the alma data , on the other hand , are much more amenable to direct fitting of models to the observed data cube .",
    "fitting models to the data cube makes use of all available information in the data and should therefore be preferred whenever it is feasible .",
    "we found that for this dataset , fitting to the pvd ( either in whole or over restricted regions ) did not lead to substantial changes in the inferred @xmath11 , compared with fitting to the full information in the data cube .",
    "furthermore , fitting models directly to the data cube is the most efficient approach , in that it avoids the additional steps of extracting a pvd or kinematic moment maps from each individual realization of a modeled data cube for a particular parameter set .",
    "gas - dynamical model fits can lead to very high - precision constraints on @xmath11 , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , in the regime of very precise model fitting results , it becomes very important to explore potential systematic uncertainties that might affect the measurement , including uncertainty in the slope or shape of the extended mass profile and uncertainty in the turbulent velocity dispersion profile .",
    "these problems are compounded when the bh s sphere of influence is not well resolved , or when models are fitted to a spatial region in which most pixels are at locations well outside of @xmath9 .",
    "neglecting these systematics could lead to catastrophic errors in determining @xmath11 that is , errors far larger than the formal model - fitting uncertainties .",
    "the ideal situation is one in which the data quality ( resolution and s / n ) are sufficient to allow model parameters to be constrained by fitting models only to spatial regions within @xmath221 , the region in which the kinematics are maximally sensitive to @xmath11 .    in this work ,",
    "we have focused on modeling uncertainties due to the degeneracy between rotation and turbulent motion , since this problem is particularly severe at high disk inclination ; in other cases , uncertainty in the stellar mass profile may be the dominant contribution to the error budget .",
    "often , in gas - dynamical model fitting , the stellar luminosity profile is taken to be a fixed profile , with just a single scaling factor @xmath66  as a free parameter .",
    "this procedure is , however , prone to underestimate the uncertainty in @xmath11 , because model fits can converge tightly on a best - fitting value of @xmath11  even if the measured stellar luminosity profile deviates from the actual extended mass profile of the galaxy .",
    "when @xmath9  is not well resolved , it is particularly important to incorporate a realistic level of uncertainty in the _ slope _ or shape of the deprojected stellar luminosity profile into the model fitting process .",
    "we have not explored this uncertainty in detail in this work , but our simple experiment of measuring @xmath11  using the galaxy profile measured from the _ hst _  f814w image illustrates the nature of the problem . for molecular gas - dynamical @xmath11  measurements , the central light profile of the host galaxy will most often be severely impacted by dust absorption , and extinction may still be an issue even in the @xmath79 band , as illustrated by the vlt sinfoni image of ngc 1332 from @xcite .",
    "this problem can be alleviated to some extent by masking out the most heavily obscured regions of the disk when measuring the stellar luminosity profile , or by using multi - color data to model and remove the effects of extinction .",
    "additionally , radial gradients in the stellar mass - to - light ratio , if present , would lead to errors in inferring @xmath64 from the galaxy s light profile .",
    "the impact of @xmath66  gradients on stellar - dynamical measurements has been investigated by @xcite , who found that plausible @xmath66  gradients could bias bh mass measurements in elliptical galaxies by @xmath222 .",
    "the influence of @xmath66  gradients on gas - dynamical measurements should be less severe since gas - dynamical data only samples the stellar mass profile within the region enclosed by the disk s radius , but past gas - dynamical work has not directly tested or simulated the contribution of @xmath66  gradients to uncertainty on @xmath11 .",
    "the best and most secure approach to circumvent these difficulties is to obtain kinematic data that highly resolve @xmath9 , so that @xmath64 is much smaller than @xmath11  over the innermost resolution elements of the data .",
    "then , uncertainty in the stellar mass profile will not have a large impact on @xmath11 .",
    "another potential source of systematic error in the model fits is the co surface brightness map .",
    "beam smearing ( both in the data and the models ) mixes information on rotation velocity , turbulent linewidth , and surface brightness near the disk center , and errors in the assumed surface brightness map can lead directly to errors in @xmath11 .",
    "the high inclination of the ngc 1332 disk makes it much more difficult to discern any surface brightness substructure that may be present . in general , resolving the emission - line surface brightness structure on small radial scales is a key requirement for accurate modeling , along with resolving the kinematic structure .",
    "ideally , the disk s surface brightness profile should be resolved on scales of @xmath196 or smaller .",
    "given the other large sources of systematic uncertainty in modeling the ngc 1332 data , we have not explored the impact of surface brightness errors on our model fits , but unresolved surface brightness substructure could be responsible for a portion of the high @xmath108  values we obtain .    as noted by @xcite , it is also the case that distance uncertainty contributes directly to uncertainty in @xmath11 , because the value of @xmath11  inferred from dynamical modeling scales linearly with the assumed distance .",
    "most bh mass measurements have not incorporated distance uncertainties into their error analysis , but this should be borne in mind in situations where the formal model - fitting precision on @xmath11  is so high that distance uncertainty becomes a major component of the error budget on @xmath11 . for ngc 1332 ,",
    "recent distance measurements listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) are between 21.9 and 24.6 mpc @xcite , and the contribution of distance uncertainty to the error budget on @xmath11  is much smaller than the other sources of systematic uncertainty associated with the dynamical modeling .      a major issue for gas - dynamical bh mass measurements is the treatment of the turbulent velocity dispersion . the disk s physical thickness will depend on @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the disk s rotational velocity , and if the turbulent velocity dispersion contributes an effective dynamical pressure that supports the disk against gravity , then this must be accounted for in the dynamical modeling .",

    "thus , if @xmath228 , then the disk can be treated as dynamically cold . in our model calculations , we have included @xmath7  merely as an empirical broadening to the emergent co linewidths from the disk , but we have not ascribed any dynamical importance to @xmath98 . these models effectively assume a dynamically cold , flat disk in which @xmath229 .",

    "the high values of @xmath108  found for our best - fitting models , and the systematic deviations between the modeled line profiles and the data ( figure [ pvdslices ] ) indicate that there are real and important aspects of the ngc 1332 disk structure and/or dynamics that are not incorporated in the models .",
    "the largest of these systematic problems are likely to be the inadequacy of our @xmath7  models and co surface brightness model , and the fact that the warp is neglected in our dynamical models .",
    "it is also possible , however , that there may be real departures from circular rotation in the disk such as @xmath233 perturbations to cloud orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or localized departures from circular orbits due to star formation or other processes within the disk .",
    "the line profiles shown in figure [ pvdslices ] show that the largest deviations of the models from the data are systematic and roughly symmetric on the blueshifted and redshifted sides of the disk , suggesting that localized random velocity irregularities are not the dominant contribution to the large @xmath108 .",
    "observations of other transitions from the @xmath17co rotational ladder , as well as @xmath234co lines and lines of other molecular species such as hcn and hco@xmath235 , can provide much more information on the temperature and density conditions in etg disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and disks such as the one in ngc 1332 will be important targets for further alma observations .",
    "additionally , it would be interesting to compare the kinematics and turbulent velocity dispersion profile of the molecular gas with the kinematics of ionized gas on the same angular scales .",
    "this can be done with _",
    "stis observations of the h@xmath219 + [ ] spectral region or other optical lines , or with adaptive optics observations in cases where br@xmath83 , [ ] , or other near - infrared lines are strong enough to enable kinematic mapping .",
    "direct comparisons of bh mass measurements using ionized and molecular gas dynamics in the same galaxy would be worth pursuing as well , to test whether molecular gas is indeed a more accurate tracer of circular velocity than ionized gas within the close environments of supermassive bhs .",
    "since our models do not provide quantitatively satisfactory fits to the alma data cube , we can not compare our results with the previous @xmath11  measurements from @xcite and @xcite in a rigorous fashion .",
    "however , it is clear that models with @xmath11  in the range found by @xcite , @xmath191 @xmath4 , lead to far higher @xmath108  values than our best - fitting models .",
    "this is the case for all of the @xmath7  prescriptions that we have examined , so our provisional @xmath11  estimate appears to be incompatible with their result .",
    "the discrepancy is particularly intriguing in that we are using the same stellar mass profile measured by @xcite for their mass modeling .",
    "the mass model from @xcite implies a total enclosed mass of @xmath236 @xmath4  within @xmath49 pc , based on their best - fitting bh mass and their stellar mass profile with @xmath186 .",
    "this gives a circular velocity of 580 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath49 pc , much larger than the maximum speed of @xmath50 km  s@xmath2  seen in the alma pvd at @xmath49 pc .",
    "adopting the @xmath237 lower bound to @xmath11  from @xcite , @xmath238 @xmath4 , we would obtain @xmath239 km  s@xmath2 , still much higher than the observed outer envelope to the pvd at this radius . in our model",
    "fit with @xmath11  fixed to @xmath143 @xmath4 , the mass - to - light ratio converged to a much lower value of @xmath240 in order to attempt to fit the disk kinematics at large radii , but still gave a very poor fit , clearly over - predicting the amplitude of the central velocity upturn as seen in the lower panel of figure [ pvdfig - flatsigma ] .",
    "the @xcite measurement of @xmath241 @xmath4  was based on constructing a mass model for ngc 1332 using the hydrostatic equilibrium of the x - ray emitting gas as a probe of the gravitational potential .",
    "the model includes components describing the stellar mass distribution of the galaxy ( based on a combination of 2mass data at large scales and the _ hst _  f814w image at small radii , with the dust disk masked out ) , the hot gas profile as measured from _ chandra _",
    "observations , the dark matter halo , and the bh .",
    "this method requires the presence of an x - ray emitting hot interstellar medium in hydrostatic equilibrium , and to date it has only been applied to a small number of etgs including ngc 4261 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 4649 in addition to ngc 1332 @xcite . the x - ray derived bh masses for ngc 4261 and ngc 4649",
    "are in agreement with masses measured for these galaxies from ionized gas dynamics ( ngc 4261 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stellar dynamics ( ngc 4649 ; * ? ? ?",
    ". for ngc 4472 , the x - ray hydrostatic equilibrium method gives @xmath242 @xmath4  @xcite while a stellar - dynamical analysis finds @xmath243 @xmath4  for model fits that include a dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "a definitive measurement of @xmath11  in ngc 1332 using higher - resolution alma data can provide a critical test of the x - ray and stellar - dynamical results .    as a fast - rotating etg with a high central stellar velocity dispersion , ngc 1332 bears some similarities to galaxies such as ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 which have been found to contain extremely massive bhs that are outliers falling well above the @xmath244 correlations of the general population of etgs @xcite .",
    "assuming the bh mass from @xcite for ngc 1332 , @xcite discuss whether the galaxy is an outlier or not relative to the @xmath245 relationship .",
    "the answer hinges on whether ngc 1332 is treated as a flattened , single - component elliptical galaxy , or a two - component s0 with bulge and disk .",
    "if it is a two - component bulge+disk system in which the elongated portion of the galaxy is considered to be a disk component , then the bh would be moderately over - massive relative to its small bulge , but if the galaxy is instead a flattened elliptical with a dominant bulge component accounting for the majority of the light , then the bh  bulge mass ratio is within the normal range for ellipticals .",
    "@xcite argue that ngc 1332 is a highly flattened elliptical , in which essentially all of the light can be ascribed to the bulge component .",
    "@xcite also support the bulge - dominated interpretation .",
    "if the bh mass is close to our provisional estimate and the value determined by @xcite , then the galaxy would lie closer to the normal bh  bulge mass ratio for etgs , and it would even fall in the low - mass tail of the scatter distribution in the @xmath246  relation for etgs ( figure 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "alma observations have an exciting potential for enabling gas - dynamical bh mass measurements , but it remains to be seen how widely applicable this method will be for exploring bh demographics . for etgs , the available pool of targets for precision measurement of @xmath11  will be a small fraction of the overall population of etgs .",
    "well - defined circumnuclear dust disks are only seen in @xmath247 of etgs .",
    "measuring accurate bh masses in these galaxies will be most successful when ( a ) the gas kinematics are dominated by simple disklike rotation , ( b ) alma observations can resolve @xmath196 , and ( c ) the molecular emission - line surface brightness is high enough that the gas kinematics can be mapped on scales well within @xmath9 .",
    "this last requirement could prove to be a major limiting factor for alma measurements of bh masses ; it is not yet known what fraction of circumnuclear disks will have detectable emission extending inward to @xmath221 . in ngc 1332 , the high - velocity emission provides evidence that the disk extends inward to at least @xmath209 pc .",
    "however , if there had been a central `` hole '' in the molecular disk with a radius much larger than @xmath248 pc then there would be no high - velocity upturn in the data and accurate measurement of the bh mass would not be possible even with higher resolution observations .",
    "molecular clouds may be easily disrupted in the immediate environments of massive bhs as a result of the extreme shear @xcite or due to winds or irradiation from intermittent accretion - powered nuclear activity .",
    "tidal disruption of molecular clouds in the close environments of supermassive bhs has also been suggested as an explanation for the lack of young stellar populations seen in the innermost few parsecs of typical s0 and early - type spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "as alma observes larger numbers of etgs having circumnuclear disks , it will be possible to determine the inner structures of these objects and search for any connections with bh mass , nuclear activity level , or other properties .",
    "accurate measurements of host galaxy luminosity profiles in the near - infrared will be a critically important component of future gas - dynamical @xmath11  measurements .",
    "ideally , these observations should have angular resolution at least as high as the alma data , and next - generation extremely large telescopes equipped with adaptive optics will bring greatly improved capabilities for these measurements .",
    "several targets for @xmath11  measurement have already been observed by alma in cycles 02 , and additional programs have been approved for cycle 3 , so the number of galaxies with detections of high - velocity rotation within @xmath9  should begin to increase rapidly in the near future . the most efficient way to pursue bh mass measurements with alma will be to continue carrying out initial , quick observations of galaxies with resolution just sufficient to test for the presence of rapidly rotating gas within @xmath9 .",
    "finding evidence of high - velocity rotation within @xmath9  will then justify deeper and higher - resolution observations that can potentially provide exquisite sampling of the gas kinematics within @xmath9 .",
    "galaxies for which @xmath11  can be measured to high accuracy using data that highly resolve @xmath9  are extremely valuable , providing firm anchors to local bh demographics and the bh - host galaxy correlations , in addition to providing strong evidence that the central massive objects are indeed likely to be supermassive bhs @xcite .    in our alma programs",
    ", we are selecting etg targets based on the presence of well - defined circumnuclear dust disks , which give morphological evidence for dense gas in rotation about the galaxy center .",
    "alma will likely be an important tool for gas - dynamical detection of bhs in spiral galaxies as well , but it is not yet known what fraction of spiral galaxies contain molecular gas in clean disk - like rotation on scales of @xmath221 .",
    "the dust - disk selection method we have used to identify etg targets for alma would not be applicable to spirals , which typically have more complex , filamentary , or spiral dust - lane structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the growing number of high - resolution alma observations of nearby spirals will make it possible to examine molecular gas kinematics in galaxy nuclei in far greater detail than has previously been possible .",
    "recently , @xcite presented dynamical modeling of alma hcn and hco@xmath235 kinematics in the sbb galaxy ngc 1097 , deriving a bh mass of @xmath249 @xmath4 .",
    "we note that for a stellar velocity dispersion of 196 km  s@xmath2  @xcite , the gravitational radius of influence of the ngc 1097 bh would be 15.6 pc or 022 , while the cycle 0 data used by @xcite had a beamsize of @xmath250 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude too coarse to resolve @xmath9 , and the observed pvd does not show any hint of a central velocity upturn .",
    "however , the alma pvd does exhibit velocity structure consistent with regular rotation within the inner @xmath251 , an encouraging sign that higher - resolution observations would have the capability to measure @xmath11  accurately if the disk kinematics continue to be dominated by regular rotation down to scales within @xmath9 .",
    "this paper presents an alma co(2 - 1 ) observation of the center of ngc 1332 at 03 resolution .",
    "we find evidence for a disk in orderly rotation with evidence for a mild kinematic twist , and a central upturn in maximum line - of - sight velocity consistent with the expected signature of rapid rotation around a compact central mass .",
    "although the quality of the cycle 2 alma data is excellent and the central upturn in maximum rotation speed provides evidence for a compact central mass in ngc 1332 , the value of the bh mass can not be tightly constrained due to severe degeneracies between @xmath11  and other parameters .",
    "these degeneracies stem primarily from beam smearing and rotational broadening of the line profiles , because the bh sphere of influence is slightly unresolved along the disk major axis and very unresolved along the minor axis .",
    "we find that the bh mass is degenerate with the turbulent velocity dispersion profile of the disk .",
    "any chosen prescription for the functional form of the disk s turbulent velocity dispersion profile can lead to formally tight constraints on the bh mass , but different choices for how to model the turbulent velocity dispersion can lead to widely divergent conclusions for the value of the bh mass .",
    "while we are unable to constrain @xmath11  definitively with the present alma data , models with a flat or exponentially declining @xmath99 profile and @xmath98 limited to values of @xmath252 km  s@xmath2  point to a bh mass in the range @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the model fits strongly disfavor a bh mass as high as the value determined by @xcite from stellar - dynamical modeling , @xmath143 @xmath4 , but agree well with the value obtained from a hydrostatic analysis of x - ray emission from the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .    when the bh sphere of influence is not highly resolved , gas - dynamical model fits can have a tendency towards high - precision formal constraints on @xmath11  that are not necessarily matched by correspondingly high accuracy , but which simply reflect the specific choices and assumptions made in constructing models",
    "this can potentially result in catastrophic errors in determining @xmath11  ( i.e. , errors that are much larger than the uncertainties in @xmath11  derived from the usual @xmath125 criteria ) . to obtain gas - dynamical measurements of @xmath11  that are both precise and accurate , there is no substitute for observations that _ highly _ resolve the bh sphere of influence .",
    "we argue that the appropriate criterion for quantifying the feasibility of carrying out a gas - dynamical mass measurement is whether the bh s radius of influence is resolved along the disk s _ minor _ axis in other words , the angular resolution of the observation should be smaller than the angular size of @xmath253 .",
    "observations satisfying this criterion ( or better ) will resolve both the essential kinematics and the emission - line surface brightness substructure in the bh environment , and will lift the degeneracy seen in this dataset between turbulent and rotational motion in the inner disk . when @xmath196 is highly unresolved , dynamical models can suffer from potentially large systematic uncertainties in deriving @xmath11  due to uncertainties in the disk s @xmath7  profile and sub - resolution surface brightness structure , and due to errors in measurement of the shape of the galaxy s spatially extended mass distribution .",
    "this initial observation was designed primarily to test for the presence of high - velocity emission from within @xmath9 .",
    "alma is capable of achieving much higher angular resolution than the 03 beamsize of these data , and new observations of ngc 1332 at 004 resolution have been scheduled for alma s cycle 3 .",
    "these new observations will enable much more detailed fitting of dynamical models on scales @xmath221 along the disk s major axis , and will nearly or fully resolve @xmath196 ( depending on the value of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we anticipate that the new data will provide firm constraints on @xmath11 , demonstrating the full potential of alma for dynamical measurement of bh masses .",
