    "in general , for positive integers @xmath18 and @xmath19 we denote by @xmath20 the family of irreducible curves in the linear system @xmath21 with precisely @xmath22 singular points , @xmath23 of which are of the type @xmath6 , @xmath24 , where @xmath6 may be any analytic type of an isolated singularity .",

    "note that @xmath29 .    in this note we give examples of such equisingular families of curves which are obstructed in the sense that they have dimension larger than the expected one .",
    "we use the idea by which chiantini and ciliberto in @xcite showed the existence of obstructed families of nodal curves .",
    "let us fix a plane @xmath30 in @xmath1 , a point @xmath31 outside @xmath30 , and a curve @xmath32 of degree @xmath33 in @xmath30 .",
    "if we intersect the cone @xmath34 over @xmath32 with vertex @xmath31 with @xmath2 , this gives a curve @xmath35 in @xmath21 which is determined by the choice of @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( see lemma [ lem : cone ] ) . in particular , if @xmath32 varies in an @xmath36-dimensional family in @xmath30 , then @xmath37 varies in an @xmath36-dimensional family on @xmath2 , and if @xmath32 is irreducible , then for a general choice of @xmath31 the curve @xmath37 will be irreducible as well ( see lemma [ lem : kegel ] ) .",

    "thus the above construction shows that @xmath63 is non - empty .",
    "however , the expected dimension is @xmath64 which is negative for @xmath65 sufficiently large , since @xmath66 this shows that @xmath67 is obstructed for sufficiently large @xmath58 .",

    "smooth if it is smooth of the expected dimension .    by @xcite theorem 1.2 and 2.3 ( which is a slight improvement of @xcite theorem 3.3 and theorem 4.3 )",
    "there is a curve @xmath73 if    * @xmath74 , and * @xmath75 for @xmath76 very general ,    where @xmath77 with @xmath78 , a certain invariant which only depends on @xmath6 .",

    "this proves the following proposition .",

    "the families in example [ ex:1 ] fail to satisfy this condition roughly by the factor @xmath95 .",
    "we thus can not conclude that these families are reducible as we could in a similar situation in @xcite .    however , if we compare condition [ eq : cond:1 ] respectively [ eq : cond:2 ] to the conditions in @xcite or @xcite which ensure that the equisingular family is t  smooth at _ every _ point , the latter basically invole the square of the tjurina number and are therefore much more restrictive .",
    "this , of course , was to be expected .",
    "in this section we collect some basic properties on cones used for the construcion in section [ sec : examples ] , in particular the dimension counts .",

    "choose a point @xmath111 and let @xmath112 .",
    "then for any point @xmath113 we have @xmath114 and thus @xmath115 .",
    "this , however , implies that the line @xmath116 is contained in @xmath32 , and since @xmath32 is irreducible we would have @xmath117 in contradiction to our assumption that @xmath32 is not a line .",

    "consider the linear system @xmath123 in @xmath1 which is given as the closure of @xmath124 and set for @xmath125 @xmath126 first we show that for @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xmath129 choose pairwise different point @xmath130 .",
    "suppose that there is a @xmath131 . since @xmath132 there is a unique intersection point @xmath133 and these points @xmath134 are pairwise different , since @xmath135 for @xmath136 .",
    "however , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , so that @xmath139 and @xmath140 are pairwise different collinear points on @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath32 is irreducible but not a line , this implies @xmath141 . in particular , if @xmath142 , then @xmath143 which implies .",
