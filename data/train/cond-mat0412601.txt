    "@xmath38 increases logarithmically with decreasing temperature down to @xmath28  k , where it shows a faint maximum . above 60  k ,",
    "the transport properties are similar to those of ordinary heavy fermion compounds . after showing a shallow minimum at 60  k",
    ", @xmath38 increases and varies approximately as @xmath31 below @xmath5  k , that is consistent with the fact that the optical conductivity in the low energy range starts to decrease below about 60  k.  @xcite    as origins of this resistivity maximum , there are two possibilities depending on the magnitude of kondo temperature @xmath39 compared with the crystalline electric field ( cef ) splitting . in the ce compounds such as cepd@xmath40 with relatively high @xmath39 comparable with the cef excitation @xmath41",

    "@xcite on the other hand , in low @xmath39 ce compounds such as ceal@xmath43 , double peaks in @xmath12 have been observed as a function of temperature ,  @xcite and are related with the two kondo temperatures ; @xmath44 at high temperatures associated with all the cef split levels and @xmath45 for low temperatures resulting from only the cef ground state for ce - heavy fermion compounds . according to hanzawa _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the cef - splitting between the ground state and the first and the second excited states , respectively .",
    "putting @xmath49  k ( between @xmath50 ground state and @xmath51 excited state estimated from the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility  @xcite ) and @xmath52  k at the resistivity maximum , @xmath45 is estimated as @xmath53  k , leading to the specific heat coefficient @xmath54  mj / k@xmath18mol .",

    "however , it should be noted that the peak temperature @xmath57  k under 14  t is close to the estimated @xmath45 and the magnetic contribution to the resistivity at 0 t shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) follows @xmath58 dependence only within the narrow temperature range @xmath59  k.    both the dc and the optical conductivities indicate the decreasing carrier number below @xmath60  k , which suggests the model to explain the low temperature properties of this material must have the temperature dependent carrier number and electronic density of states . @xmath12 above @xmath60  k can be understood as of the ordinary ce kondo compound with a peak at @xmath28  k corresponding to @xmath39 or @xmath44 . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the increases in @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate the reduction of density of states at @xmath19",
    ". however , the approximate @xmath31 dependence of @xmath22 in such a wide temperature range ( of about two orders of magnitude ) down to 0.6  k rules out the simple semiconducting state as an origin .",
    "such a temperature dependence of @xmath22 could be ascribed to the temperature dependence of carrier density @xmath61 and scattering lifetime of electrons @xmath62 , even if we assume the simplest single fs model . by combining @xmath23 , where only the temperature dependence of @xmath61 plays a role",
    ", we might be able to separate the two contributions .",

    "@xmath23 is positive for all the three compounds and the magnitude is not much different . the estimated carrier density is between @xmath63  holes / f.u . at rt .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath23 for laos@xmath14sb@xmath1 is not so large , but have a broad minimum near @xmath64  k. the decrease down to 40  k is ascribed to the change in the main scattering centers from the isotropic phonon - scattering with large wave vectors ( @xmath65 ) to the anisotropic phonon - scattering with smaller @xmath65 , and the increase below @xmath64  k reflects the recovery to the isotropic scattering by impurities .",
    "@xcite    near rt , @xmath23 for both ceos@xmath14sb@xmath1 and ceru@xmath14sb@xmath1 increases drastically with decreasing temperatures .",
    "such an increase in @xmath23 have been observed in many ce - based kondo compounds related with the kondo - like increase in resistivity ,  @xcite however , the magnitude is unusually larger than that was reported previously ; usually @xmath23 shows a peak of the magnitude less than @xmath66m@xmath24/c near @xmath39 . for ceru@xmath14sb@xmath1 , @xmath23 tends to saturate to @xmath67m@xmath24/c below @xmath68  k , which is consistent with the temperature dependence of the electronic density of states at @xmath19 in the optical measurement .",
    "@xcite interestingly , @xmath23 in ceos@xmath14sb@xmath1 shows approximately @xmath69 dependence in the same temperature range where @xmath22 varies approximately as @xmath31 .",
    "this fact automatically rules out the simple assignment of the origin of the @xmath31 dependence in resistivity to the @xmath2-dependence of carrier density . in the case of kondo insulator cenisn ,",
    "the inconsistent temperature dependence between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( the decrease in @xmath22 contradicts with the decreasing carrier number estimated from @xmath23 with decreasing temperature ) has been ascribed to the increase in the carrier mobility with decreasing temperature .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependences of hall mobility @xmath70 in ceos@xmath14sb@xmath1 and ceru@xmath14sb@xmath1 are compared in fig  [ mu ] .",
    "both the magnitude and the temperature dependence of @xmath71 for the two compounds are very close above @xmath60  k , where no drastic change in the electronic density of states at @xmath19 has been reported .",
    "@xcite thus , the initial rise in @xmath71 with decreasing temperature in fig .",
    "[ mu ] could not be ascribed to the increase in the carrier mobility within the normal hall effect contribution , but is more naturally ascribed to the anomalous hall effect ( the skew scattering ) .",
    "in addition , for ceos@xmath14sb@xmath1 , taking into account @xmath36 dependence of @xmath72 associated with the spin fluctuation near afm critical point , the anomalous hall component is expected to dominate also at lower temperatures . in many kondo compounds ,",

    "the reduction factor @xmath81 is about five times larger than that in @xmath22 , which is unexplainable only by a carrier density change in the simplest single carrier model .",
    "this drastic field effect is in sharp contrast with the pressure effect on @xmath22 reported to be minor in ceos@xmath14sb@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    these field dependences might be ascribed to the combined effect of changes in carrier number and in carrier scattering intensity .",
    "the former alone in the simplest single carrier model is unable to explain both @xmath12 and @xmath29 as was already mentioned related with the mobility in fig .",
    "[ mu ] . in magnetic systems",
    ", the anomalous hall component sometime predominates over the normal one ; i.e. , the hall resistivity composed of the normal component proportional to magnetic field @xmath82 and anomalous one proportional to magnetization @xmath83 as @xmath84 using @xmath78 in fig .",

    "@xcite the peak structure can be reproduced , however , the agreement of both the position and the width are not satisfactory .",

    "@xcite above about 4  t , the phase boundary determined by the transport measurements deviates from that by the specific heat measurement , which might be due to the small missalignment of crystalline direction to the magnetic field .",
    "recently , rotundu and andraka also determined the @xmath6 phase diagram for @xmath86 $ ] up to 10  t based on the specific heat measurements .",
    "@xcite their data points are in between those in the present experiment and those in the specific heat measurement by namiki _",

    "exhibits an evident anomaly up to 14  t , though the magnitude becomes quite small .",
    "the feature of phase diagram is reminiscent of the antiferro - quadrupole ( afq ) transition observed in ceb@xmath87 .",
    "@xcite however , as already pointed out from the @xmath20 measurements ,  @xcite the electronic part of the entropy release ( @xmath88 at 0 t and @xmath89 at 4 t ) below the transition temperature is too small to be attributed to localized @xmath9-electron contributions .",
    "itinerant nature of @xmath90 electrons is also suggested by bauer _",
    "_ in relation to the wilson ratio @xmath91 which is of the order of unity for ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite here @xmath92 is the effective magnetic moment , @xmath93 is the pauli susceptibility , and @xmath94 is the sommerfeld coefficient .",
    "moreover , the possibility of an afq transition in cubic system requires that the cef ground state is @xmath95 quartet , however , from the magnetic susceptibility measurements ,  @xcite the @xmath96 ground state is suggested for ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 inconsistent with the afq scenario .",
    "taking into account the minor change in @xmath22 and @xmath23 across the transition along with the anomalous hall contribution reflecting the conduction electron scattering by magnetic instability , the transition at 0.8  k may be ascribed to the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order .",
    "yogi _ et al_. have found a clear anomaly at @xmath97  k in a recent sb - nqr experiment ,  @xcite which was ascribed to the onset of sdw order .",
    "rotundu and andraka pointed out that their finding of a sizable decrease of sommerfeld coefficient above 5  t is in sharp contrast with the kondo insulators ,  @xcite such as cenisn ; where magnetic fields increase the sommerfeld coefficient by destroying the @xmath15 hybridization and closing the energy gap .",
    "@xcite the quenching of spin fluctuations by magnetic fields is a possible explanation for the apparent decrease of sommerfeld coefficient ,  @xcite which also indirectly suggests the origin of phase transition to be the sdw order .",
    "however , the relation between the sdw order and the afq - like phase diagram is still unclear .",
    "ce(ru@xmath98rh@xmath99)@xmath100si@xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) is also reported to exhibit a sdw order below 6 k.  @xcite however , there exists a clear difference between the two compounds ; in ce(ru@xmath98rh@xmath99)@xmath100si@xmath100 , the change in carrier number may be minor , even if it exits , since it has a metallic ground state and the @xmath6 phase diagram exhibits an ordinary afm - like one .",
    "therefore , one can infer that the change in carrier density might play some role in the unusual @xmath6 phase diagram of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 . to elucidate the origin of the phase transition and to establish the phase diagram including anisotropy , more intense studies on other physical properties are necessary .",
    "finally , we discuss the comparison of the transverse and longitudinal magnetoresistance as shown in fig .",
    "[ r_h ]  ( a ) .",
    "@xmath22 is larger in the longitudinal ( @xmath102 ) than in the transverse geometry ( @xmath103 ) above @xmath104  t. if only the lorenz magnetoresistance plays a role , @xmath103 is never smaller than @xmath102 .",
    "if one assumes the conventional form of exchange interaction @xmath105 between a conduction electron with spin @xmath106 and a magnetic impurity with spin @xmath107 , the magnetoresistance is isotropic ; independent of the relative orientation of the current and magnetic field directions .",
    "fert reported experimental results of anisotropic magnetoresistance due to heavy rare earth ions in au ,  @xcite which is explained by taking into account the quadrupolar interaction .",
    "he has also calculated the anisotropic magnetoresistance for ce impurities in la ,  @xcite which qualitatively explains the experimental result . at this stage",
    ", we can not say any conclusive remark on the anisotropic magnetoresistance in fig .",
    "[ r_h ]  ( a ) , however , it should be noted that some contribution from the orbital angular moment is necessary to explain such a anisotropic magnetoresistance . that might be also related with the unusual @xmath6 phase diagram , in which the strong correlation between 4@xmath9- and conduction electrons is expected .    in summary",
    ", we have found an unusual temperature dependence of both electrical resistivity and hall coefficient below @xmath5  k in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , which may be ascribed to the combined effect of carrier density decreasing and spin fluctuations .",
    "the anomalous low temperature state with large electrical resistivity is considerably suppressed by the magnetic fields , suggesting a drastic change of electronic structure and suppression of spin fluctuations by the magnetic field .",

    "<S> we have measured both magnetoresistance and hall effect in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 to clarify the large resistivity state ascribed to the kondo insulating one and the origin of the phase transition near 0.9  k reported in the specific heat measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we found unusual temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence both in the electrical resistivity @xmath3 and the hall coefficient @xmath4 over the wide temperature range of about two order of magnitude below @xmath5  k , which can be explained as a combined effect of the temperature dependences of carrier density and carrier scattering by spin fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> an anomaly related with the phase transition has been clearly observed in the transport properties , from which the @xmath6 phase diagram is determined up to 14  t. taking into account the small entropy change , the phase transition is most probably the spin density wave one . both the electrical resistivity and hall resistivity at 0.3  k is largely suppressed about an order of magnitude by magnetic fields above @xmath7  t , suggesting a drastic change of electronic structure and a suppression of spin fluctuations under magnetic fields . </S>"
