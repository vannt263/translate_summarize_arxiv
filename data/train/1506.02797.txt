    "sturmian words are infinite words having exactly @xmath24 distinct factors of each length @xmath25 . by the celebrated theorem of morse and hedlund @xcite , they are the aperiodic binary words with minimal factor complexity",
    ". every sturmian word is characterized by an irrational number @xmath3 and a real number @xmath26 called the _ angle _ and the _ initial point _ respectively . the sturmian word @xmath27 is defined by rotating the point @xmath26 by the angle @xmath3 in the torus @xmath28 and by writing a letter @xmath29 when the point falls in the interval @xmath30 and a letter @xmath31 when the point falls in the complement .",
    "the fibonacci word @xmath32 is a well - known sturmian word obtained by taking both the angle and the initial point equal to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the golden ratio .",
    "the fibonacci word @xmath35 is also the limit of the sequence of finite fibonacci words @xmath36 , defined by @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for every @xmath13 , that are the natural counterpart of the fibonacci numbers in the setting of words .",
    "sturmian words have several equivalent definitions and a lot of combinatorial properties that make them well - studied objects in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science .",
    "in fact , there exists a huge bibliography on sturmian words ( see for instance the survey papers @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "2 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap . 6 ) and the references therein ) .",
    "there are mainly two approaches to sturmian words : one is purely combinatorial , while the other uses techniques from elementary number theory to derive correspondences between the finer arithmetic properties of the irrational @xmath3 and the factors of the sturmian words of angle @xmath3 . in the language of computer science ,",
    "such correspondences are called _",
    "semantics_. in this paper , we aim at building upon such approach by showing new semantics allowing us to give new and tight results on the abelian combinatorics of sturmian words .",
    "indeed , this approach extends to the abelian setting the well - known fruitful semantics that in the last decades have allowed researchers to derive deep and important results on the combinatorics of infinite words from the theory of codings of rotations and continued fractions of irrationals .",
    "interestingly these semantics also allowed researchers to shed new light on consolidated theories by exploiting the opposite direction .",
    "a remarkable example of this is represented by the work of b. adamczewski and y. bugeaud @xcite .",
    "concerning the maximum exponent of repetitions in sturmian words , there exists a vast bibliography ( see for example @xcite and the references therein ) , which stems from the seminal work on the fibonacci word presented in @xcite . indeed , the study of repetitions in words is a classical subject both from the combinatorial and the algorithmic point of view .",
    "repetitions are strictly related to the notion of periodicity .",
    "recall that a word @xmath40 of length @xmath41 has a _ period _",
    "@xmath42 if @xmath43 for every @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the letter in the position @xmath46 of @xmath40 .",
    "the _ exponent _ of @xmath40 is the ratio @xmath47 between its length @xmath41 and its _ minimum period @xmath48_. when studying the degree of repetitiveness of a word , we are often interested in the factors whose exponent is at least @xmath49 , called _ repetitions_. repetitions whose exponent is an integer are called _ integer powers _ since a word @xmath40 with integer exponent @xmath50 can be written as @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath40 is the concatenation of @xmath0 copies of a non - empty word @xmath52 of length @xmath48 .",
    "if instead @xmath0 is not an integer , then the word @xmath40 is a _",
    "fractional power_. in this case we can write @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the prefix of @xmath52 of length @xmath55 .",
    "for example , the word @xmath56 is a @xmath57-power since it has minimum period @xmath58 and length @xmath59 .",
    "a good reference on periodicity is ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) .    a measure of repetitiveness of an infinite word is given by the supremum of the exponents of its factors , called the",
    "_ critical exponent _ of the word .",
    "if this supremum @xmath11 is finite , then the word is said to be @xmath60-power - free ( or simply @xmath11-power - free if @xmath11 is irrational , so there are no factors with exponent @xmath11 ) . for example , the critical exponent of the fibonacci word @xmath35 is @xmath61 @xcite , so @xmath35 is @xmath62-power - free . in general , a sturmian word @xmath27 is @xmath11-power - free for some @xmath11 if and only if the continued fraction expansion of @xmath3 has bounded partial quotients @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent of @xmath27 can be explicitly determined by a formula involving these partial quotients @xcite .",
    "recently , the extension of these notions to the so - called abelian setting has received a lot of interest .",
    "abelian properties of words have been studied since the very beginning of formal language theory and combinatorics on words .",
    "the notion of the parikh vector of a word ( see later for its definition ) has become a standard and is often used without an explicit reference to the original 1966 paper by parikh @xcite .",
    "abelian powers were first considered in 1957 by erds @xcite as a natural generalization of usual integer powers .",
    "research concerning abelian properties of words and languages developed afterwards in different directions .",
    "for instance , there is an increasing interest in abelian properties of words linked to periodicity ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "recall that the parikh vector @xmath63 of a finite word @xmath40 enumerates the total number of each letter of the alphabet in @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , two words have the same parikh vector if and only if one can be obtained from the other by permuting letters .",
    "an _ abelian decomposition _ of a word @xmath40 is a factorization @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , the words @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 have the same parikh vector @xmath69 and the parikh vectors of the words @xmath70 and @xmath71 are contained in @xmath69 ( that is , they are component - wise less or equal to @xmath69 but not equal to @xmath69 ) .",
    "the sum @xmath2 of the components of the parikh vector @xmath69 ( that is , the length of @xmath66 ) is called an _ abelian period _ of @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the words",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 , the first and the last factor of the decomposition , are respectively called the _ head _ and the _ tail _ of the abelian decomposition . notice that different abelian decompositions can give the same abelian period .",
    "for example , the word @xmath72 has an abelian period @xmath49 with @xmath73 ( the empty word ) , @xmath74 and @xmath75 or with @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "abelian exponent _ of @xmath40 is the ratio @xmath79 between its length @xmath41 and its minimum abelian period @xmath80 .",

    "the main contribution of this paper is the description of a framework that allows us to translate arithmetic properties of rotations of an irrational number in the torus @xmath28 to properties of abelian powers and repetitions in sturmian words .    in @xcite ( and in a very preliminary form in @xcite )",
    "a bijection ( that we call _ sturmian bijection _ ) between factors of sturmian words and subintervals of the torus @xmath86 is described . in the last three decades",
    ", the sturmian bijection has allowed researchers to shed light on the combinatorics of the factors of sturmian words especially from the point of view of repetitions .",
    "most of the results on maximal repetitions in sturmian words stem in fact from the sturmian bijection .",
    "we show in this paper that the sturmian bijection preserves abelian properties of factors . in particular , using the sturmian bijection",
    ", we prove that a sturmian word of rotation angle @xmath3 contains an abelian power of period @xmath2 and exponent @xmath50 if and only if @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the distance between @xmath89 and the nearest integer . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum exponent of an abelian power of period @xmath2 in a sturmian word of rotation angle @xmath3 is @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the sturmian word @xmath27 of angle @xmath3 and initial point @xmath26 contains an abelian power of period @xmath2 and exponent @xmath50 starting at position @xmath91 if and only if @xmath92 or @xmath93 save for few exceptional positions related to the points @xmath94 .",
    "we recover the result of @xcite that abelian powers of arbitrarily large exponent occur at every position of a sturmian word .",
    "a sturmian word always contains abelian powers of arbitrarily large exponent , so we can not define a direct analogue of the critical exponent to the abelian setting .",
    "instead we define the _ abelian critical exponent _ of a sturmian word @xmath5 of angle @xmath3 as the quantity @xmath6 where @xmath95 ( resp .",
    "@xmath96 ) denotes the maximum exponent of an abelian power ( resp .  of an abelian repetition ) of abelian period @xmath2 in @xmath5 ( in fact , the two superior limits coincide ) .",
    "we show that @xmath4 equals the _ lagrange constant _ of the irrational @xmath3 , a well - known constant in number theory ( see section [ sec : approx ] for its definition ) . via this connection",
    ", we determine @xmath4 in terms of the partial quotients of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath3 .",
    "this allows us to prove that @xmath9 for every sturmian word @xmath5 and that the equality holds for the fibonacci word .",
    "we further prove that @xmath4 is finite if and only if the continued fraction expansion of @xmath3 has bounded partial quotients , that is , if and only if @xmath10 is @xmath11-power - free for some real number @xmath11 .",
    "we finally focus on the particular case of the fibonacci word @xmath97 .",
    "we prove that in the fibonacci word the maximum exponent of an abelian power of period @xmath12the @xmath15th fibonacci number  equals @xmath98 and that for every @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the longest prefix of the fibonacci word that is an abelian repetition of period @xmath12 has length @xmath14 if @xmath15 is even and @xmath16 if @xmath15 is odd .",
    "we then prove that the minimum abelian period of any factor of the fibonacci word is a fibonacci number ; a result analogous to a result of currie and saari @xcite concerning ordinary periods .",
    "these results allow us to give an exact formula for the minimum abelian periods of the finite fibonacci words .",
