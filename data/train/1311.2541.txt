    "the recently completed calculation of the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to the total hadronic top - quark pair - production cross section @xcite has been preceded by the derivation of the velocity enhanced terms in a threshold expansion in ref .",
    "the latter publication exploited the advances in soft - gluon resummation @xcite and dealt with the incorporation of potential effects , which were proven to factorize in ref .  @xcite .",
    "after factorization of the born cross section , the threshold expansion is given for the two leading channels , quark annihilation and gluon fusion , in terms of inverse powers of the top - quark velocity , @xmath0 , and its logarithms .",
    "unfortunately , the expansion formulae are missing @xmath0-independent terms , which are more difficult to derive .",
    "these terms are of some phenomenological interest , since they propagate through resummation to higher orders @xcite . in principle , they can be obtained by expanding the fits to the numerical results provided in refs .",
    "nevertheless , due to the inherent lack of numerical precision in the strict threshold region , this approach leads to large uncertainties .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite quotes a 50 % uncertainty on the constant in the gluon fusion case .",
    "it is thus interesting , whether these constant terms can be obtained by other methods .",
    "reviewing the same problem at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , we notice that the @xmath0-independent terms have only been obtained after an exact analytic calculation of the total cross sections @xcite , and their projections onto the singlet and octet color configurations of the top - quark pair @xcite .",
    "currently , it is hardly conceivable to perform similar analytic calculations at nnlo .",
    "however , the threshold behavior of cross sections for heavy - flavor production is much better understood and it seems that the necessary information can be inferred from soft - gluon factorization . in this case",
    ", the effect of the radiation is contained in color configuration dependent soft functions , which are convoluted with hard functions representing the purely virtual contributions .",
    "as long as one is only interested in nnlo expansions of cross sections including @xmath0-independent terms , an additional factorization of the potential effects is not necessary .",
    "the hard and soft functions are needed for color singlet and octet configurations of the final state .",
    "unfortunately , apart from the color singlet soft function @xcite , they are unknown beyond nlo . at nlo , the soft function for the production of a massive color octet state at threshold has been evaluated in refs .",
    "interestingly , ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates its application to the production of a fundamental scalar .",
    "the purpose of this work is to evaluate the color octet soft function at nnlo .",
    "the hard functions will be presented together with the complete virtual corrections in a subsequent publication .    beyond total cross sections ,",
    "there are related developments aiming at the derivation of expansions and resummations of differential distributions in different kinematical regimes of top - quark pair - production .",
    "most recent results are to be found in refs .",
    "they are extensions of previous analyses from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the factorization of cross sections in the threshold limit with emphasis on hard functions .",
    "subsequently , we define the soft function and provide the details of our calculation , the results for the bare soft function in @xmath1-dimensions , as well as the renormalized expression to be used in applications .",
    "conclusions and outlook close the main text , which is supplemented with two appendices , one on wilson lines and the other containing the anomalous dimensions , which are needed for renormalization .",
    "consider the total hadronic cross section for the production of a heavy quark - anti - quark pair accompanied by any number of gluons and massless quarks .",
    "we will denote with @xmath2 the invariant mass of the final state at threshold , i.e.  @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the heavy - quark mass .",
    "notice that our considerations can also be applied to the production of an elementary state , e.g.  a color octet scalar .",
    "in this case , there are no potential exchange effects in the final state and the discussion is slightly simplified .",
    "the cross section can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the partonic cross section for the initial state partons @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the partons @xmath7 and @xmath8 inside the hadrons @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the superscript 0 underlines that the quantities are not collinearly renormalized , while the symbol @xmath13 denotes convolution in the momentum of the partons .",
    "there are only two possible channels in the born approximation to the partonic cross section : quark - anti - quark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "we now assume that we are only interested in the production close to threshold , where the total energy of any additional radiation is strongly restricted from above , and the final state heavy quarks are non - relativistic .",
    "this condition can be enforced at the hadronic level by the available collider energy .",
    "nevertheless , we will not discuss its phenomenological relevance in realistic situations .",
    "let us first ignore any potential ( e.g.  coulomb ) interactions between the heavy quarks , which are also enhanced at threshold .",
    "the partonic matrix elements factorize in this soft limit .",
    "any radiation can be approximated by emissions from eikonal lines , which can be described as wilson lines at the operator level ( see [ sec : wilson ] for the definition and properties of wilson lines , and section [ sec : soft ] for their relation to eikonal lines ) .    in the soft approximation ,",
    "the matrix elements of the basic hard @xmath14 production process without radiation are taken at threshold ( potential effects are ignored at this point ) , while the partonic cross section for this process is only affected by radiation through the phase space volume .",
    "let us denote the four - momentum of the radiation by @xmath15 , while the initial parton momenta in the center - of - mass system by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the phase space volume for the two particle state depends on @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and the last approximation amounts to only keeping the leading behavior in the @xmath20 limit .",
    "if we now parameterize @xmath21 as @xmath22 then the volume of the phase space will be given by @xmath23 the factorization formula is @xmath24 where we have suppressed the parton indices , and the sum runs over color structures @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath26 are the hard functions , i.e.  cross sections for the @xmath14 process , while @xmath27 are the soft functions containing the effect of the soft radiation from the wilson lines . the convolution is performed in the @xmath28 $ ] variable defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : z1],[eq : z2 ] ) . the origin of the color structure indices is best understood by inspecting a schematic representation of the factorization given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fac ] .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents the unitarity cut . on the left hand side",
    ", we have the matrix element , while on the right hand side its complex conjugate .",
    "the factorization occurs at the matrix element level for each color structure represented by the @xmath13 symbol .",
    "the sum over color configurations is thus coherent",
    ".     stands for the hard function , whereas @xmath29 for the soft function .",
    "the double lines denote wilson lines , whereas the @xmath13 symbols stand for the insertion of the color structure of the hard matrix element .",
    "the sum over different color structures is suppressed.[fig : fac],width=340 ]    the choice of a basis for the color structures in the factorization formula is crucial . indeed ,",
    "if the hard matrix elements are decomposed into singlet and octet configurations of the final state , then the out - going wilson lines of the soft functions at threshold , i.e.  having the same velocity , can be combined into one as shown in [ sec : wilson ] .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fac1 ] ) becomes diagonal @xcite , since the color configurations of the singlet and octet are orthogonal ( for initial state gluons , there are two octet configurations , symmetric and anti - symmetric - they are also orthogonal by bose symmetry ) .",
    "the final factorization formula is now @xmath30 where the single color index in the hard and soft functions specifies diagonal elements of both , and runs over singlet and octet configurations .    at this point",
    ", we have to take into account the effect of potential interactions between the non - relativistic final state quarks .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that we do not have to make substantial changes in our exposition @xcite .",
    "as long as the hard function contains @xmath31-wave effects only and is decomposed into irreducible color representations of the final state , non - relativistic effects factorize from the soft effects .",
    "this factorization implies that the heavy - quark velocity must be set to zero in the soft component , as we already assumed . on the other hand , the hard amplitudes are to be expanded in the velocity , rather than just evaluated at threshold . in principle , we could now further factorize the potential effects in the hard functions as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we shall not do that , since we are not interested in their resummation , but rather in the fixed order expansion of the cross sections at threshold .",
    "this is achieved by formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : fac2 ] ) after inclusion of the renormalization of the pdfs in the soft limit in order to yield finite results .",
    "a last subtlety concerns the restriction to @xmath31-wave contributions in the hard functions .",
    "indeed , it is to be expected that higher partial waves will occur in the velocity independent terms of their threshold expansions beyond nlo .",
    "nevertheless , they are not enhanced by soft radiation at nnlo and , consequently , do not spoil the expansion generated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fac2 ] ) .    although the partonic cross section on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fac2 ] ) suffers from initial state collinear divergences only , factorization introduces additional divergences into the hard and soft functions on the right hand side .",
    "we now consider the renormalization of these infrared divergences of the hard functions . since the latter are given by total cross section contributions due to color projected purely virtual amplitudes , the information we need is contained in the singularities of the virtual amplitudes themselves .",
    "it turns out that the complete divergence structure of a uv renormalized amplitude @xmath32 is encoded in the following equation @xmath33 where the @xmath34 renormalization constant @xmath35 is a matrix in color space and has a non - trivial dependence on the kinematics @xmath36 , and by the same on the masses @xmath37 of the @xmath38 external partons .",
    "it can be derived from the differential equation @xmath39 where the color space matrix anomalous dimension is given by @xcite @xmath40 its structure for massless partons has been determined already in ref .",

    "for an outgoing quark ( or incoming anti - quark ) the generator is @xmath47 , whereas for an incoming quark ( or outgoing anti - quark ) the generator is @xmath48 .",
    "the kinematic dependence is contained in @xmath49 , where the sign factor @xmath50 if the momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 are both incoming or outgoing , and @xmath53 otherwise . for massive partons there is @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . the cusp anomalous dimensions , @xmath57 , for the massless and massive cases , and the functions @xmath58 can be found in ref .",

    "it is interesting to note that the triple color correlations given in the third and fourth lines of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) can not contribute to the divergences of spin and color summed amplitudes at nnlo , as long as the born amplitudes do not contain complex couplings or masses .",
    "this implies in particular that they will not contribute to top - quark pair - production amplitudes , which was noticed for the quark annihilation channel in ref .",
    "@xcite and for both channels in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the general case ,",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "first , notice that one can decompose the born amplitude treated as a vector in color and spin space in terms of color structures @xmath59 where the vectors @xmath60 are made of @xmath61 and @xmath62 only .",

    "the color matrix elements of the triple color correlator are thus anti - symmetric in the color indices and we have @xmath66 since @xmath67 , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) vanishes if @xmath68 is real . due to elementary spin summation rules , this is the case if there are no complex parameters in the lagrangian ( the case of complex parameters is generally of interest , since we might want to describe unstable particles ) .",
    "the argument presented above is , of course , also valid for diagonal matrix elements between color projected born amplitudes , which shows that the nnlo renormalization constants for our hard functions can be determined from the dipole correlations given in the first two lines of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "since the initial partons are either in the fundamental , or the adjoint representation , while the final state may be in a singlet or octet configuration , we have to consider a set of color vectors @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the representation of the initial partons , while @xmath71 that of the final state .",
    "the subscripts @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the latter case stand for symmetric and anti - symmetric octets in the case of an @xmath74 initial configuration .",

    "the expansion in @xmath0 in the definition of the hard functions would directly correspond to the soft approximation of taking the matrix element at threshold and keeping the exact phase space , if there were no potential effects . due to the latter ,",
    "the result contains inverse powers and logarithms of @xmath0 .",
    "the renormalization of the hard functions is now achieved with @xmath79 where the renormalization constant @xmath80 satisfies the equation @xmath81 with @xmath82 contrary to the hard function itself , the hard anomalous dimensions are finite in the @xmath83 limit , and do not depend on the scattering angle @xmath84 .",

    "we mentioned before that the same formalism can be applied to the production of a fundamental object , e.g.  a color octet scalar .",
    "clearly , the constant @xmath80 will also be used for the renormalization of the soft function , which does not depend on the nature of the final state .",
    "this means that the latter does not play any role in the divergences of the amplitude at threshold .",

    "such a contribution corresponds to a product of a real emission and a pure virtual contribution .",
    "it thus vanishes by the arguments from the beginning of this subsection . in consequence",
    ", for each pair of emissions as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eikonalid ] , it is sufficient to only consider the second graph with a modified color factor corresponding to the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ colorid ] ) .    as far as the virtual integrals are concerned , it turns out that they are the same as those that were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the complete list is    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     where the naming of the master integrals , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , matches that of ref .",
    "our integrals are all integrated to euler gamma functions in @xmath1-dimensions , because we only have one massive line .",
    "the remaining phase space integration has the same complexity as in the @xmath133 case .",
    "we use a subset of the formulae from the calculation of the double - real corrections , but never have to introduce any mellin - barnes integrations .",
    "therefore , the final result does not contain any hypergeometric functions and is given by @xmath175      after summing the contributions from the previous subsections and renormalizing according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) , we obtain the following perturbative expansion of the soft function for color octet production at threshold in mellin space @xmath176 with @xmath177 in case the initial state is a color octet as well , i.e. @xmath178 , this result further simplifies to become @xmath179 of course , the logarithmic terms proportional to @xmath180 , @xmath181 , in these expressions can be derived directly from the rge eq .",
    "( [ eq : rge ] ) .",
    "the new results are thus at @xmath182 .",
    "we have presented the result for the next - to - next - to - leading order soft function for color octet production at threshold .",
    "the primary use of this result is the derivation of the constants in the threshold expansion of nnlo qcd cross section for heavy - flavor pair - production .",
    "this will be one of the topics covered in an upcoming publication .",
    "our results may have further applications , for example in the determination of threshold expansions of nnlo cross sections for other massive particle ( e.g. squarks , gluinos ) production in pairs , or as single fundamental states ( e.g. color octet scalars ) .",
    "essential is only the combined color configuration of the final state .",
    "the results could also be generalized to arbitrary representations , since the most complicated part of the calculation was the evaluation of the integrals .",
    "we have refrained from such a generalization in this publication .",
    "since the result for the bare soft function is exact in @xmath1-dimensions , it can be used as part of a calculation of the soft function at higher orders .",

    "we consider the following wilson line operator @xmath183 which represents the contribution to the path integral of a classical particle charged under the representation @xmath78 of the gauge group , and moving in a straight line with four - momentum @xmath0 between the points @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the operator acts in color space , with @xmath128 in front of the exponential denoting path ordering .",
    "this allows to account for the color state evolution of the particle due to gluon emission .",
    "finally , @xmath186 stands for the bare coupling constant .",
    "the relation between the bare and renormalized couplings is given at the level of @xmath187 as @xmath188 the @xmath189 renormalization constant @xmath190 can be determined using the scale independence of @xmath191 and the renormalization group equation satisfied by @xmath192 @xmath193 with @xmath194 , @xmath195 .    in our exposition we do not need the shift , @xmath196 , of the trajectory , and often explicitly write the color indices .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following simplified notation @xmath197 the gauge group representations relevant to this study are : * 3 * for quarks , @xmath198 for anti - quarks , and * 8 * for gluons . for these three cases ,",
    "there is @xmath199 notice that @xmath200 because the hermitian conjugation implies the same change of the order of the color operators in the path ordering , as the different definition of the operators in eq .",

    "gauge transformation properties of green functions involving wilson lines can be verified using covariance @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the gauge transformation matrix at point @xmath196 in the representation @xmath78 .",
    "the wilson line operator satisfies a first order linear differential equation @xmath203 where the second equation is the boundary condition .",
    "this leads to the composition law @xmath204 which implies a differential equation on the second argument of the operator @xmath205 which we shall use below . since the operator acting on the right hand side of the differential equation , eq .",
    "( [ diff0 ] ) , is anti - hermitian , @xmath206 is unitary .",
    "we restrict ourselves to wilson lines for a straight line motion , because they model soft gluon emission from a hard emitter , the kinematics of which is not affected by the radiation . in momentum space , soft radiation is described by eikonal lines , where each emission contributes a kinematical factor @xmath207 , with @xmath136 and @xmath162 the hard and soft momenta respectively .",
    "this factor is rescaling invariant in the hard momentum , a property which the wilson line must , therefore , also have .",
    "this can only be realized if the arguments of @xmath206 are restricted to null or infinity , i.e.  @xmath208 .",
    "our lines are semi - infinite , i.e.  start or end at 0 , where the hard process takes place in the semi - classical picture of the collision . in this case , the integration in the exponent in the definition eq .",
    "( [ wilson ] ) is regulated by a factor @xmath209 , with @xmath210 , and sign as appropriate to make the integral convergent .",
    "these factors correctly reproduce the causal @xmath211 prescription in the eikonal propagators in momentum space .",
    "let us now consider the case of an out - going heavy - quark  anti - quark pair at threshold .",
    "the quarks share the same four - momentum @xmath212 , where we have used rescaling invariance to rescale the energy to unity .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that as long as the pair is in an irreducible representation of the gauge group , the eikonal lines can be combined into one .",
    "we reproduce here the argument in our notation for the singlet and octet cases .    for a singlet initial configuration after the production in the hard process",
    ", the soft radiation is described by    @xmath213    which in fact means that there is no soft radiation from the final state . in the case of an octet configuration",
    "we have to consider the combination @xmath214 we wish to prove that this combination can be replaced by a single line in the octet representation .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement @xmath215 at @xmath216 .",
    "the equation is trivially satisfied at @xmath217 .",
    "it is also satisfied at all @xmath218 , because both sides fulfill the same differential equation obtained by taking a derivative in @xmath218 and using eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) .",
    "here we give the anomalous dimensions necessary to determine the renormalization constants for the hard functions . in the octet case , they have been originally determined in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath219 notice that the anomalous dimension for the adjoint representation of the initial state , i.e.  for gluon fusion , is the same for the symmetric and anti - symmetric final state color octet configuration",
    ".    additionally , we reproduce the necessary soft limits of the splitting functions in mellin space , which are , up to this order , textbook material @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 . as is well known , the off - diagonal terms of the splitting functions are not singular in the soft limit .",
