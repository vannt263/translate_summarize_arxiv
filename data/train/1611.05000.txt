    "the simplest extension of the standard model that can accommodate naturally light neutrino masses is the well - known seesaw model @xcite , where at least two singlet majorana fermions , @xmath3 , are added and can couple to the lepton doublets via a higgs - yukawa coupling .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a @xmath6 complex matrix and @xmath7 is a two - dimensional complex symmetric matrix .    while the majorana mass scale has been traditionally assumed to be very large so that the light neutrino masses can be explained with yukawa couplings of @xmath8 , the absence of any indication of new physics that solves the hierarchy problem suggests that a more natural option would be to assume a majorana scale of the order of the electroweak scale",
    ". the lepton flavour puzzle would not be qualitatively different to the quark one , at least in what concerns the spread in the yukawas , since the neutrino yukawas would need to be only slightly smaller than the electron and light - quark ones . from a phenomenological point of view",
    "this is of course a very interesting possibility since the heavy majorana neutrino states might be searched for in fixed - target experiments and at colliders .    in this letter",
    "we explore the opportunities that this opens for the discovery of leptonic cp violation .",
    "in particular we concentrate on the observables that could be provided by direct searches of these heavy neutrino states , more concretely their mixings to electrons and muons .",
    "it is well - known that in seesaw models there is a strong correlation between the mixings of the heavy states and the light and heavy neutrino spectrum . in particular for just one neutrino species / flavour , the mixing of the heavy state is essentially fixed to be @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the light neutrino mass and @xmath11 is the heavy one .",
    "this is the naive seesaw scaling which implies that the mixing of heavy states is highly suppressed .    in the case of more families",
    "the correlation still exists but it is not so strong .",
    "in particular , using the casas - ibarra parametrization of the model @xcite , the mixing of the heavy neutrinos is given in all generality by @xmath12 where @xmath10 is the diagonal matrix of the light neutrino masses ( note that the lightest neutrino is massless because only two majorana singlets are included ) , @xmath13 is a @xmath6 matrix that depends on the neutrino ordering ( nh , ih ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 the @xmath16 identity matrix and @xmath17 . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is the pmns matrix , which depends only on two cp violating phases in this case , and @xmath19 is the diagonal matrix of the heavy neutrino masses .",
    "@xmath20 is a two - dimensional complex orthogonal matrix , that depends generically on one complex angle , @xmath21 .",
    "the entries in this matrix can be very large and therefore the naive seesaw scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) is not generically satisfied in the case of more than one family . in this work",
    "we will fix the known oscillation parameters to their best fit values as taken from @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "we pointed out that in the region of mixings accessible to direct search experiments the ratio of mixings to electron and muons of the heavy states are essentially fixed by the pmns matrix and is therefore very sensitive to its unknown cp phases . in this paper , our aim is to quantify the cp discovery potential of such measurement .",
    "interestingly this measurement provides an example of a cp - conserving observable that is sensitive to leptonic cp - violation .",
    "it should be noted that the results below will also apply to the model with three neutrinos , where one of them is sufficiently decoupled , as in the @xmath22msm @xcite .",
    "given the upper bound on the light neutrino masses of @xmath8ev , the naive seesaw scaling formula of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) implies that the mixings of the heavy states are of @xmath23 , a value at the limit of sensitivity of ship @xcite in the gev range or fcc - e in the @xmath24gev range @xcite .",
    "this implies that in most of the sensitivity range of ship and other collider experiments the entries of @xmath20 need to be largish and in this case the dependence of the mixings on the unknown parameters simplifies greatly .",
    "indeed , a perturbative expansion in the small parameters @xmath25 shows that the ratio of electron / muon mixings does not depend on the complex angle @xmath26 , nor on the masses of the heavy states , and only depends on the the mixing angles and cp phases of the pmns matrix @xcite . defining @xmath27 ,",
    "the result for the inverted ordering ( ih ) is : @xmath28 , \\nonumber\\\\    ( 1 - \\sin\\phi_1\\sin2\\theta_{12 } \\left(1 + { 1\\over 4}r^2 \\right)+ { 1\\over 2 } r^2 c^2_{12 } \\right ) c_{23}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\theta_{13 } ( \\cos \\phi_1 \\sin \\delta - \\sin\\phi_1 \\cos 2 \\theta_{12 } \\cos\\delta ) \\sin 2 \\theta_{23}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\theta_{13}^2 ( 1+\\sin\\phi_1 \\sin 2 \\theta_{12 } ) s_{23}^2   + { \\mathcal o}(\\epsilon^3)\\big],\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : uihanal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for the normal one ( nh ) : @xmath29 , \\nonumber\\\\    & & + 2   \\sqrt{r } ~\\theta_{13 } \\sin(\\phi_1+\\delta ) s_{12 } s_{23}^2 - \\theta_{13}^2 s_{23}^2 + { \\mathcal o}(\\epsilon^{5/2})\\big].\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : unhanal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the parameter @xmath30 and the majorana masses determine the global size of the mixings , and therefore the statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the ratio of mixings .",
    "the question we want to quantify is what is the range of the pmns cp - phase parameter space , that is the rectangle @xmath31 $ ] , in which leptonic cp violation can be discovered via the measurement of the electron and muon mixings of one of the heavy neutrinos . in order words for which values of the true parameters @xmath32 can these mixings be distinguished from those at the cp conserving points @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we consider two future experiments that have the potential to discover sterile neutrinos in complementary regions of masses : ship @xcite and fcc - ee @xcite .",
    "the ship experiment @xcite will search for the heavy neutrinos of the seesaw model in charmed and b meson decays .",
    "neutrinos with masses below charmed and b meson masses could be discovered , and the best sensitivity is expected for masses around 1 gev . in order to carry out our study we would ideally need an estimate of the uncertainty in the determination of the mixing angles of the sterile neutrinos to electrons and muons as a function of those mixings and the heavy neutrino masses .",
    "such information has not been published yet by the collaboration .",
    "the only publicly available result is the sensitivity reach ( corresponding to 2 expected events ) on the plane @xmath37 vs @xmath38 for five scenarios , where the contribution of electron and muon channels is combined .",
    "the number of events in the flavour @xmath39 channel is expected to scale as @xmath40 because @xmath41 controls the number of charm decays into sterile neutrinos , while @xmath42 controls the fraction of those that decay to the lepton flavour @xmath39 within the detector length ( which is assumed much smaller than the decay length ) .    among the five scenarios studied in @xcite ,",
    "there are however two of them where either the mixing to electrons or the mixing to muons dominates by a large factor . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ship ] we reproduce the ship sensitivity curves for these electron - dominated ( iv ) and muon - dominated ( ii ) scenarios . as an illustration , we indicate a few points for different values of the casas - ibarra parameter @xmath30 .",
    "note that there exist stringent bounds from direct searches .",
    "we do not include them in the plot because they are flavour dependent and can not be easily interpreted in terms of @xmath41 .",
    "they restrict severely the region of masses below @xmath43 gev and cut slightly the range of largest mixings .",
    "we will not consider this region of parameter space .",

    "the indicated points correspond to the cp conserving case and @xmath44 in ascending order for ih ( circles ) and nh ( squares ) . ]    in order to estimate the number of electron and muon events as a function of the casas - ibarra parameters , we make the assumption that for each mass , the two events at the sensitivity limit are electron or muon respectively and that the sensitivity limit is based on the observation of one of the heavy neutrinos , @xmath45 . above the sensitivity limit , at each mass , the number of events is obtained by scaling up the two events according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scal ] ) .    besides the number of electron and muon events we assume that the mass of the heavy neutrino is measured .",
    "this can be done by reconstructing the invariant mass in the two particle decay channels such as @xmath46 for example . again",
    "the uncertainty in the determination of the mass as a function of the mass and mixing has not yet been presented by the ship collaboration .",
    "a realistic error is much harder to estimate in this case , since it involves reconstructing a peak in the invariant mass .",
    "we will therefore assume a fixed relative error of @xmath47 .      for masses above 2 gev",
    ", the heavy neutrinos can be searched for in high luminosity colliders such as the future @xmath0 circular collider ( fcc - ee ) @xcite that can provide @xmath48 @xmath49 boson decays at rest per year .",
    "sterile neutrinos with masses @xmath50 can be produced in the decay @xmath51 , and leave a very characteristic signal of a displaced vertex produced by the decay of the long - lived heavy neutrino .",
    "a simplified sensitivity estimate from this measurement has been presented in @xcite . in particular in the recent analysis of @xcite , a fcc - ee configuration with @xmath52 z",
    "decays per year and an inner tracker that can resolve a displaced vertex at a distance between @xmath53 mm and @xmath54 m has been assumed in the context of the same two scenarios above . the sensitivity reach assuming @xmath55 efficiency and zero background",

    "]    we have estimated the number of events in the electron and muon channels from a rescaling of the two events at the sensitivity limit analogously to the ship case . however , in this case it is not possible to assume that the decay length is always long compared to the measurable displacement of the vertex and this is why an upper limit in mixings appears for the largest masses . in this case , the proper scaling is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the neutrino lorentz boost gamma factor and @xmath59 is its lifetime . in order to resconstruct this scaling factor ,",
    "we have used the results of @xcite to evaluate the lifetime as a function of the mixing and mass .",
    "in order to quantify the discovery cp potential we consider that ship or fcc - ee will measure the number of electron and muon events in the decay of one of the heavy neutrino states ( without loss of generality we assume to be that with mass @xmath45 ) , estimated as explained in the previous section .",
    "we will only consider statistical errors .",
    "the test statistics ( ts ) for leptonic cp violation is then defined as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of events for the true model parameters , and @xmath62 is the number of events for the cp - conserving test hypothesis that minimizes @xmath63 among the four cp conserving phase choices @xmath64 and over the unknown test parameters .",
