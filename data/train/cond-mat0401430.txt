    "the development of methods based on the density functional theory@xcite and of the computer power has allowed to conceive calculations of phase diagram from first principles@xcite as an alternative to laboratory experimentations .",
    "traditionally , only substitutional effects were considered , which was good enough to reproduce the topology of most phase diagrams .",
    "so as to obtain a more quantitative agreement with experimental data , it has been shown more recently that electronic excitations@xcite as well as lattice vibrations@xcite could play an important part in the relative stability of different phases .",
    "we chose to test the ability of these first principles methods to predict the solubility limit of zr in an aluminium solid solution this part of the al - zr phase diagram being interesting because of the presence of a metastable phase .",
    "the al - richest intermediate phase of the al - zr phase diagram is al@xmath0zr .",
    "this compound has the do@xmath1 structure which is body - centered tetragonal with eight atoms per unit cell , some of these atoms being allowed by symmetry to move along the main axis of the unit cell ( fig .",

    "it is stable up to 1580@xmath510@xmath6c .",
    "the solubility limit of zr in al  ( fcc ) is really low , the maximum solubility being 0.083  at.% at the peritectic reaction , liquid+zral@xmath0 @xmath7 ( al ) .",
    "the solubilities of zr in both liquid and solid were definitively determined by fink and willey @xcite and the assessed phase diagram is based on their data .",
    "the solid solubility was determined from resistivity data and checked by metallography .",

    "this metastable phase can also form from the melt as a primary phase during rapid solidification@xcite : al@xmath0zr acts as nuclei for solidification of ( al ) and zr can thus work as a grain refiner of al .",
    "this metastable phase is also responsible for the effectiveness of zr to control recrystallization in al - based alloys : it leads to a more uniform distribution of fine precipitates that pins grains and subgrains boundaries .",
    "moreover , this phase is really stable against coarsening and redissolution , all this making it highly desirable .",
    "as few experimental data are available for this phase , it is hard to fit a thermodynamic model for it . in such a case ,",
    "a first principles calculation of the phase diagram should allow us to obtain properties that are not available experimentally .    in order to assess the metastable phase diagram , we studied with the same tools and approximations the l1@xmath2 and do@xmath1 phases",

    "the equilibrium parameters , like the volume , shape of the unit cell , or positions of atoms , were obtained . for stable structures",
    "they can be compared to experimental data .    using this whole set of calculations we applied the cluster expansion to deduce the energy of any structure based on the same underlying lattice in the al - zr system , examining carefully the way to include volume relaxations .    at finite temperature , the electronic excitations ,",
    "the vibrational free energy , and the configurational entropy have to be taken into account . at the end of this part , we are able to obtain a thermodynamic model written in the same way as in a calphad approach and to calculate the corresponding solubility limits .",
    "formation energies were calculated at absolute zero temperature for 26 compounds in the al - zr binary system , all based on an fcc lattice .",
    "calculations were carried out using a full - potential linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( fp - lmto ) method @xcite in the version developed by methfessel and van schilfgaarde @xcite .",
    "the basis used contained 22 energy independent muffin - tin - orbitals ( mto ) per al and zr site : three @xmath8 values for the orbitals s and p and two @xmath8 values for the orbitals d where the corresponding kinetic energies were @xmath9 ry ( spd ) , @xmath10 ry ( spd ) , and @xmath11 ry ( sp ) .",
    "a second panel with a basis composed of 22 energy independent mto with the same kinetic energies was used to make a correct treatment of the 4p semicore states of zr .",
    "the same uniform mesh of points was used to make the integrations in the brillouin zone for valence and semicore states .",
    "the number of divisions along reciprocal vectors was chosen big enough to ensure a convergence of the total energy of the order of 0.1 mry / atom for each structure .",
    "the radii of the muffin - tin spheres were chosen to have a compactness of 47.6% for al sites and",

    "as we are in the case of a dilute solid solution , the solubility limit of zr in al  ( fcc ) is an analytic function of the temperature@xcite , @xmath44    the solubility we obtained is too low : at the melting temperature of the perictectic it is equal to 0.0016  at.%  zr , whereas the one deduced from experimental data is 0.08  at.%  zr @xcite . when comparing the variation with respect to @xmath45 of @xmath46 with experimental measurements , we obtain a straight line having the same slope as fink data @xcite ( _ _ cf . _ _ fig .",

    "they assumed that only an enthalpy term , and no entropy term , contributes to the free energy difference between the stable and metastable phases .",

    "the enthalpy difference between the two compounds was assumed to arise from the coherency of the phase l1@xmath2 with the matrix .",
    "they calculated from the elastic properties of al and an estimate of the composition dependence of the lattice parameter an elastic energy of 1.52  mry / atom .",

    "@xcite ( @xmath51  mry / atom ) .",

    "this may be due to an overestimation of the vibrational free energy of the disordered phase because of the use of the debye model for this phase . correcting the vibrational entropy of the solid solution",
    "so as to fit the experimental measurements of fink , we were able to predict the metastable solubility limit which lies between the estimation of murray and the one of saunders , both obtained by a calphad method .",
