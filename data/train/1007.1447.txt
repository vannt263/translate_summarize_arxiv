    "there have been many surprises in the field of superconductivity in the last 25 years .",
    "first and foremost was the discovery of superconductivity at elevated temperatures in the copper - oxide materials @xcite . for conventional metals and alloys , in the model developed by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductivity is mediated through lattice vibrations where electrons form bound pairs @xcite ; the condensation below the critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) is also accompanied by the formation of an isotropic _ s_-wave energy gap at the fermi surface . within this framework , it was thought that the critical temperature could not exceed approximately 30  k @xcite . with @xmath3 s in excess of 130  k at ambient pressure and an unusual _ d_-wave energy gap with nodes at the fermi surface , the pairing mechanism in the cuprates remains unresolved .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath7 with the surprisingly high transition temperature of @xmath8  k @xcite initially suggested an unusual pairing mechanism ; however , the isotope effect established that the superconductivity in this material is likely phonon mediated @xcite . in this particular case , the high phonon frequencies in mgb@xmath7 are likely responsible for the unusually large value for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in the iron - arsenic lafeaso@xmath9f@xmath10 ( 1111 ) pnictide compound @xcite was surprising because iron had long been considered detrimental to superconductivity .",
    "different rare earth substitutions in this material quickly raised @xmath11  k @xcite . while such high values for @xmath3 do not definitively rule out a phonon - mediated pairing mechanism , the presence of magnetic order close to the superconductivity in these compounds @xcite has led to the suggestion that the pairing in this class of materials may have another origin @xcite .",
