    "the fair facility intends to study the still controversial and empirically less known high energy domain of the ( anti)nuclear interactions in more details than before .",
    "for instance , the nuclear equation of state for strangeness degrees of freedom and also the in - medium antinucleon - nucleon interaction are some of the key projects  @xcite .",

    "it is based on the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory , which is a well established tool for infinite and finite nuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "however , as already shown many years ago  @xcite , there are still unresolved problems in rmf models , when applying them to antiproton - nucleus scattering and to heavy ion collisions . by just imposing g - parity arguments , like in microscopic models  @xcite",

    "this incompatibility of mean - field models with respect to g - parity symmetry has been also shown in recent transport studies  @xcite , where one had to largely decrease the antinucleon - meson couplings by hand in order to reproduce the empirical data .    in this work",
    "we address this issue why the conventional rmf models do not describe antiproton - nucleus dirac phenomenology . to be more specific ,",

    "such interactions describe rather successfully the saturation properties of nuclear matter , but they miss the energy dependence of the mean field .",
    "a possible solution to this problem has been proposed in  @xcite where the momentum - dependent phenomenological form factors were introduced . in  @xcite",

    "moreover , we use the same coupling constants for both nucleon and antinucleon interactions .",

    "the nld calculations show an explicit energy dependence for both components of the antinucleon self - energy . in particular , the self - energies decrease with increasing energy , for all baryon densities . on the other hand , with rising baryon density they increase only moderately at each energy .",
    "the saturation in energy and density results from the non - linear interaction , as discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite . in the linear walecka model the lorentz - vector self - energy grows strongly with increasing density , while the lorentz - scalar component saturates .",

    "the mean - field potential consists of the sum of scalar and vector self - energies . at vanishing momentum and at saturation density",
    "the linear walecka model leads to a value of @xmath54  mev , which is too deep according to phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "this feature has been always a critical problem in standard rmf models .",
    "even the inclusion of non - linear self - interactions of the @xmath3 field ( and eventually of the @xmath43 field )  @xcite do not improve the result , since non - linear self - interactions become pronounced only above the saturation density .",
    "on the other hand , the nld model reduces considerably the deepness of the potential at zero momentum by almost a factor of two .",
    "the particular difference of the potential depth at vanishing momentum between conventional rmf and nld is not a trivial issue .",
    "the consequences of such an energy and density behavior will be discussed below when considering the optical potentials .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to reproduce the data from antiproton - induced reactions , the antinucleon - meson coupling constants of the walecka model have to be rescaled by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows also the calculations in the linear walecka model , but with rescaled couplings by a factor of @xmath56 ( dash - dotted curves in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] , the rescaled walecka model  @xcite reproduces the nld results in average .",

    "the vector self - energy diverges with increasing density leading to a too strong repulsion at high densities .",
    "in fact , this effect of repulsive nature is softened in the rescaled model to large extend , however , the linear divergent behavior of the vector self - energy still remains .",
    "the nld calculations agree ( in average ) with the rescaled walecka model around the saturation density and at kinetic energies around @xmath57  gev only .",
    "the very different energy behavior of the self - energies between nld and linear walecka models influences the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential . in general , it is extracted from ( anti)proton - nucleus scattering and therefore it is suited for comparisons between theory and empirical studies .",
    "its real part is given by @xmath58 where @xmath38 is the energy of an ( anti)nucleon with bare mass @xmath59 inside nuclear matter at a fixed baryon density and upper ( lower ) sign holds for nucleons ( antinucleons ) .",

    "predicts the behavior of the optical potential versus energy only qualitatively , and strongly diverges with increasing kinetic energy of the nucleon .",
    "it does not reproduce the empirical saturation at higher energies .",
    "this problem is well known in rmf and has already attracted much attention in the past  @xcite .",
    "of course , the main reason for such strong deviation is the missing energy dependence of the self - energy in the standard rmf . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nld approach resolves this issue of rmf models .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] corresponds to the nld calculations and describes the data very well .    on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction of an antinucleon at a given momentum relative to nuclear matter at rest is quite different with respect to the proton - nucleus interaction : the sign of the lorentz - vector self - energy changes in eq .",
    "( [ u_opt ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the linear walecka model the real part of the optical potential is again a linear function in energy , as in the nucleon case , but now it diverges to @xmath61 ( see fig .",

    "but for the antiproton case .",
    "the filled box at vanishing momentum represents empirical data extrapolated to saturation density @xcite .",

    "such a prediction is in contradiction with calculations using dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "in fact , by fitting the imaginary part of the antinucleon - nucleus optical potential to the total proton - antiproton cross section , its real part decreases with increasing energy .",
    "furthermore , an existing information from heavy - ion collisions  @xcite and reactions induced by protons  @xcite and antiprotons  @xcite give clear evidence for a considerable reduction of the antiproton - nucleus optical potential with rising energy .",
    "as has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transport theoretical description of antiproton - nucleus data is not possible within the conventional walecka model , except if one rescales the antinucleon - meson coupling constants by a phenomenological factor of @xmath64 .",
    "this is not compatible with g - parity arguments and suggests a strong violation of the charge conjugation symmetry in the nuclear medium  @xcite , which otherwise must be a perfect symmetry in strong interactions .    on the contrary ,",
    "the nld calculations ( solid curve in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) predict a completely different behavior as compared with the walecka model .",
    "it results in a much softer potential at vanishing momentum and much stronger decrease of the real part of the optical potential @xmath65 with increasing energy .    due to the large annihilation cross section",
    "experimental data at low energies can be obtained only at very low densities @xmath66 close to the nuclear surface  @xcite , while empirical information at saturation density is obtained by extrapolation only . at these low densities",
    "the nld model leads to values of @xmath67  mev , which seem to be still too deep with respect to the data  @xcite . at the density of interest @xmath68",
    "the nld model predicts a rather soft potential , which is much closer to extrapolated data  @xcite and dispersion relations  @xcite ( filled box at zero kinetic energy in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a comparison between our model and phenomenological antiproton - nucleus reactions at higher energies seems more meaningful .",
    "in fact , with increasing energy the annihilation cross section drops strongly and it is supposed that the antiprotons may penetrate deeper inside the nuclear interior , and thus densities close to @xmath69 can be tested .",
    "the second filled area in fig .  [ fig3 ] shows the empirical optical potential as extracted from the transport theoretical analyses in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this energy region",
    "the comparison between nld results and transport calculations ( which use conventional rmf , but with largely reduced antinucleon - meson couplings ) turns out to be fairly well .",
    "our results are also in qualitative agreement with the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a strong decrease of @xmath65 with increasing energy is obtained .",
    "interestingly , the antinucleon optical potentials @xmath65 strongly differ at zero momentum between nld and standard rmf , while in the nucleon case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) no differences were visible . by considering the fields at the same baryon density and at zero momentum one would naively expect a similar potential depth for both models .",
    "indeed , the non - linear effects start to dominate above the saturation density  @xcite .",
    "however , the observed difference at zero momentum comes from the in - medium dependence of the ( anti)nucleon single - particle energy . at fixed saturation density",
    "the energy shift , caused by the difference ( proton - nucleus ) or sum ( antiproton - nucleus ) of two big fields , varies strongly between the two models .",
    "however , small shift variations in the energy affect the nld self - energies , due to their pronounced energy dependence .",
    "on the other hand , the fields of the linear walecka model are not influenced due to their independence on energy .",
    "this feature becomes more pronounced with increasing density , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( middle and right panels ) . in terms of the optical potentials",
    "the interpretation is similar . in the proton - nucleus case ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) the slopes between both models at vanishing momentum are essentially the same",
    ". therefore the in - medium energy shift is of minor relevance and there is no gap between both potentials . in the antiproton - nucleus case ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the gap is much more pronounced due to the quite different slopes between nld and linear walecka optical potentials .    ) ) in the nld approach ( solid curves ) is compared to experimental data ( symbols ) taken from @xcite .",
    "the filled area indicates the model changes by varying the density from @xmath70 up to @xmath71 ( relative to @xmath72 ) .",
    "the inserted panel shows the same quantity but at the fixed saturation density @xmath73 , again in comparison to data ( symbols ) , which are extrapolated to @xmath72 . ]    for a complete description of in - medium antiproton interactions also the imaginary part of the optical potential is needed .",
    "since rmf does not provide the imaginary part of the self - energies , we estimate @xmath74 using dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 means the antiparticle momentum and @xmath77 denotes the principal value . the real part @xmath65 is taken from the nld model . the results are shown in fig .",
    "the insert in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows @xmath74 versus the kinetic in - medium energy @xmath78 at saturation density . at vanishing kinetic energy",
    "the imaginary part of the optical potential is rather large ( @xmath79  mev ) and consistent with empirical information ( error bars )  @xcite . at high beam energies",
    "@xmath74 start to decrease again , but remains rather strong .",
    "the present estimation seems to be in line with the empirical study of ref .",

    "according to refs .",

    "the solid curve shows the model result at an average density of @xmath85 .",
    "as one can see the nld model reproduces the data  @xcite fairly well also at these low densities .",
    "in summary , the nld model , which incorporates on a mean - field level non - linear effects in baryon density and simultaneously in single - particle energy , has been applied to nucleon and antinucleon interactions in nuclear matter .",
    "we have shown that due to the explicit energy dependence of the self - energies the proton - nucleus optical potential is very well reproduced . at the same time , the nld model predicts a much softer real part of the antiproton optical potential at low energies as compared to the walecka model .",
    "we also find a strong decrease of the optical potential with increasing energy .",
    "these results are remarkably consistent with available information from reactions involving heavy ion and ( anti)proton beams and other studies based on dispersion - theoretical approaches . a comparison with the conventional walecka model has shown that the main effect responsible for a description of the in - medium ( anti)nucleon optical potential originates from the energy dependence of the mean - field , which is absent in standard rmf models .",
    "we further estimated the imaginary part of the antiproton optical potential within the nld model using dispersion relation .",
    "the results were in qualitative agreement with the low density data and empirical extrapolations at saturation density .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that rmf models may remain a very useful theoretical tool for the description and analysis of the antinucleon interactions in nuclear medium .",
    "the energy dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the antinucleon optical potential , studied in this work , is expected to be important at energies relevant for the @xmath2anda  experiment at fair .",
    "the nuclear compression due to the strong attractive antinucleon mean - field , which significantly differs between the walecka and the nld models , and also the very different energy behavior between them will affect the dynamics of antiproton - nucleus reactions .",
    "thus , we expect various observable phenomena at fair as important probes for the nld predictions . for instance , the fragmentation of the excited and radially expanded residual nuclei , where the energy transferred to radial expansion is expected to depend on the degree of compression .",
    "strangeness production of @xmath86 and especially @xmath87 hyperons , such as cascade ( @xmath88 ) particles , is expected to be medium dependent , in particular close to threshold energies .",
    "the associate formation of single-@xmath16 and , in particular , of double - strange hypernuclei is thus supposed to be also model dependent . as an outlook we conclude the importance and relevance of our results for the future activities at fair .",
