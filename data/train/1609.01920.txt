    "the main goal of the high energy heavy - ion collisions is to study the phase structure of the quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) phase diagram at finite temperature ( @xmath5 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models suggest that the qcd phase diagram may contain a first order phase transition line between the hadron gas ( hg ) phase and strongly coupled quark - gluon phase which ends at the critical point towards high @xmath5 and lower @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "experimental programs have been performed at sps , beam - energy scan ( bes - i ) program at rhic to search for critical point and qgp - hg phase transition . in future ,",
    "the upgraded program at rhic ( bes - ii )  @xcite , fair  @xcite , nica  @xcite and j - parc  @xcite will also contribute to this physics at large @xmath6 .",
    "the location of the qcd critical point can be explored by systematically varying @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "experimentally , by changing the center of mass energies one can control the @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the system , hence enables us to scan different sectors of the phase diagram .",
    "one of the most striking signatures of such a qgp - hg phase transition could be a strong modification in the fluctuations of specific observables measured on an event - by - event basis  @xcite . in principle , any observable that is not globally conserved , fluctuates .",
    "although , most of these fluctuations are trivial and are of statistical origin .",
    "it is important to find out the dynamically relevant event - to - event fluctuations , that enables to the search for a possible critical point and a first order co - existence region in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "over the past two decades quite a number of such observables have been suggested for clarifying the evolution of the system formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these either refer to the signals from the plasma that are supposed to survive the phase transition or to the observables that experience strong fluctuations during the phase transition or close to the critical point .",
    "most commonly measured event - by - event fluctuations in heavy ion collision experiments are particle ratios ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 etc . ) , transverse energy @xmath9 , transverse momentum @xmath10 and particle multiplicity @xmath11 fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "predictions suggest that , enhanced multiplicity fluctuations connected to the production of qgp droplets , and suppression of fluctuation connected to the nucleation process in a first order qgp  hg phase transition .",
    "this may happen because of the rapid freeze - out just after the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "an isothermal compressibility of the system can be considered to understand the sensitivity of the measured particle multiplicity to the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the isothermal compressibility is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath5 being the volume , temperature , and pressure of the system , respectively . in order to relate the compressibility to the measurements of multiplicity fluctuations",
    ", we assume that relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be described as a thermal system in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce )  @xcite .",
    "the gce is the most appropriate description as only part of the particles from the system around mid - rapidity are measured by experiments .",
    "the energy and conserved quantum numbers in this region can be exchanged with the rest of the system , that serves as a heat bath  @xcite .",
    "several other studies have applied canonical and micro - canonical ensembles to the multiplicity fluctuations  @xcite . in the gce ,",
    "the isothermal compressibility is directly related to the variance of the particle multiplicity as follows :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the particle multiplicity , @xmath16 is the mean of the multiplicity distribution , and @xmath17 is boltzmann constant  @xcite . here",
    ", multiplicity fluctuation measurements are presented in terms of the scaled variance , @xmath18 as  @xcite :    @xmath19    in a continuous , or second - order phase transition , the compressibility diverges at the critical point . near the critical point",
    ", this divergence is described by a power law in the variable @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the critical temperature .",
    "hence , the relationship between multiplicity fluctuations and the compressibility can be exploited to search for a signature of critical behavior by looking for the expected power law scaling of the compressibility :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the critical exponent for isothermal compressibility  @xcite .",
    "recent studies  @xcite shows the behavior of the quark number susceptibility , @xmath24 , which is related to the value of the isothermal compressibility of the system , predict that its value will increase by at least an order of magnitude close to the qcd critical point . as discussed above ,",
    "the scaled variance is proportional to @xmath25 , hence the measurements of charged particle multiplicity are expected to be a sensitive probe for critical behavior .",
    "if the system approaches close enough to the critical line for a long enough time period , then critical phenomena could be observed through the measurement of multiplicity fluctuations  @xcite . which subsequently may also be possible to determine the critical exponents of the system .",
    "observation of critical behavior in heavy ion collisions and the subsequent measurement of the critical exponents could determine the universality class in which qcd is grouped , providing essential constraints for the models  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of conserved quantities are predicted to be one of the most sensitive signals of the qgp formation and phase transition , which may provide complementary understanding of strong interactions , apart from other qgp signatures  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that entropy conserving hadronization of a plasma of quarks and gluons should produce a final state characterized by a dramatic reduction of the net - charge fluctuations in qgp phase as compared to that of a hadron gas .",
    "further , prediction relies on the notion that quark - quark correlations can be neglected , and hadronization of gluons produces pairs of positive and negative particles not contributing to the net - charge fluctuations .",
    "it has also been suggested that , the excitation function of conserved numbers like net - baryon , net - charge and net - strangeness fluctuations should show a non - monotonic behavior , as a possible signature of qcd critical end point ( cep )  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",

    "the experimentally measured moments of the net - baryon , net - charge , and net - strangeness distributions are related to the higher power of @xmath26 of the system and hence these moments can be used to look for signals of a phase transition and critical point  @xcite .",
    "also , the comparison of experimentally measured cumulants with the lattice calculations enables us to extract the freeze - out parameters i.e. freeze - out temperature ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath6 of the system produced in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . in recent years",

    "the charge carriers in the qgp phase are quarks having fractional charge , while in hadronic phase the constituents have unit charge , hence the measure of the fluctuations in the net - charge particle production is expected to be different in these two cases  @xcite . in this section , we will discuss the net - charge fluctuations using different fluctuation measures such as @xmath0 and higher moments .",

    "it can be argued that , the reduction of fluctuation might be larger at lower beam energies .",

    "it is observed that the fluctuation observable show monotonic decrease in magnitude with increasing and approaches expectation for a simple qgp - like scenario  @xcite as we move from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "it has been argued that measurements in lower ( below 10 gev ) are dominated by baryons while at higher energies the meson and resonance production becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "this suggests that the change in dynamical net - charge fluctuations below = 19.6 gev might be partially due to a transition from baryon to meson dominance in the sps energy regime .",
    "it is also argued that the differences between the fluctuation values below and above 19.6 gev may result from changes in the collision dynamics and final state interaction effects  @xcite .",
    "for the highest rhic energy , the measured value of fluctuation observable is close to the hg prediction , whereas at lower energies the results are higher than hg value .",
    "this may be due to the fact that at highest rhic energy (= 200 gev ) the fluctuation may not be strong enough to be measured or because of the dilution of fluctuation during the evolution process . at lhc energy = 2.76 tev , the fluctuation observable value is significantly lower as compared to lower energies results .",
    "the fluctuations at the lhc energy might also have been diluted because of various effects , still these fluctuations are smaller than the theoretical hg expectations and show a clear tendency towards qgp expectation .",
    "this may indicate that , the fluctuations have their origin in the qgp phase  @xcite .    given that several other observables already indicates that a hot and dense medium of color charges has been formed at rhic and lhc , the net - charge fluctuation results suggest that either the observable @xmath0 is not sensitive enough to qgp physics or the process of hadronization washes out the qgp signal for this observable .",
    "it may be also noted that the theoretical models results do not incorporate the acceptance effects and dynamical evolution of the system like for example the dilution of the signals in the hadronization process  @xcite .      in recent years , the beam energy scan ( bes ) programs at sps and rhic have drawn much attention to map the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram in terms of temperature ( @xmath5 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the location of the critical point can be explored by systematically varying @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which can be experimentally achieved by varying the of the colliding ions .",
    "several theoretical models suggest that , excitation function of conserved numbers such as net - baryon , net - charge , and net - strangeness fluctuations should show a non - monotonic behavior as a possible signature of qcd critical end point ( cep )  @xcite . in the vicinity of the qcd",
    "critical point , these variances are proportional to the square of the correlation length ( @xmath26 ) which is expected to diverge at the critical point  @xcite . however , the magnitude of the correlation length is limited by the system size and by finite time effects ( critical slowing down ) , which could be as small as 2 to 3 fm .",
    "hence , the contribution to the fluctuations from the critical point might be too weak as to be discovered experimentally , if only the second moments are measured .",
    "therefore , it has been proposed to measure higher , non - gaussian moments of the fluctuations which are expected to be much more sensitive to the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the moments of the net - baryon , net - charge , and net - strangeness distributions are related to the @xmath26 of the system and hence these moments can be used to look for signals of a phase transition and critical point  @xcite .",

    "hence it is proposed to study the higher moments of conserved number distribution due to their stronger dependence on @xmath26 .",

    "in summary , we have presented a review on the experimental measurements on charge fluctuations over various collision energies to search for phase transition and location of the critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "we reviewed the results on total charge fluctuations as a function of collision centrality for = 17.3 gev in collisions at sps and for = 62.4 and 200 gev in collisions at rhic .",
    "it is observed that , the relative fluctuation increase from central to peripheral collision .",
    "the fluctuation observable from various models are compared with the experiment data .",
    "the results from models show centrality independent behavior .",
    "a similar centrality dependence has been observed for total charge fluctuation at the sps and rhic experiments .",
    "the absence of large dynamical fluctuation in excess of the participant superposition model indicate that there is no evidence of critical behavior related to the compressibility observable .",
    "we have also presented the results from net - charge fluctuations from sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the net - charge fluctuations in terms of dynamical fluctuation measure @xmath0 as a function of collision centrality and are studied .",
    "the @xmath0 increases monotonically from peripheral to central collisions and remain negative indicating the dominance of correlation of positive and negative charged particles .",
    "the product of @xmath0 and @xmath1 show a monotonic decrease in magnitude with increasing and approaches expectation from a qgp like scenario . for the highest rhic energy ,",
    "the measured value of fluctuation is close to the hg prediction , whereas at lower energies the results are higher than hg expectation . at lhc energy",
    "= 2.76 tev , the value of fluctuation observable is significantly lower with compared to lower energy results indicating at lhc energy the fluctuations have their origin in the qgp phase .",
    "the fluctuation of net - charge ( net - proton , net - electric charge and net - kaon ) have been measured for various .",
    "deviations are observed for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 of net - proton distribution from the skellam and hadron resonance gas model for @xmath4 39 gev .",
    "maximum deviations from skellam expectation are observed for = 19.6 and 27 gev .",
    "the net - electric charge results from both phenix and star experiments are presented .",
    "the @xmath2 values from both the experiments decrease with increasing .",
    "the @xmath3 values from phenix remain constant and positive , between 1.0 @xmath92 2.0 at all the collision energies within the statistical and systematic uncertainties . however , there is 25% increase of @xmath3 values at lower energies below = 39 gev compared to higher energies .",
    "the @xmath3 values from star experiment are constant at all energies within uncertainties , except for = 7.7 gev which shows a negative @xmath3 value . the net - electric charge and net - kaon results do not observe any significant non monotonic behavior as a function of collision energy .    to quantify the excess of net - charge fluctuations due to the critical point",
    ", different baseline studies have been done by different authors after considering various physical phenomenon .",
    "on phenomenological side , effect of resonance decay  @xcite , proton - antiproton correlations  @xcite , kinematic acceptance  @xcite , non - extensive systems  @xcite , regeneration  @xcite and excluded volume models  @xcite etc . are studied .",
    "besides , various studies have been carried out using different monte carlo based models for example urqmd  @xcite and hijing  @xcite etc . to compare the experimental results .",
    "but it is to be noted that all the above mentioned physical processes contribute differently at various center of mass energies , therefore to find a `` unique ideal baseline estimate '' to compare the experimental results is still a unsettled issue .",
    "the freeze - out parameters are extracted using higher moments of net - charge distributions with lattice qcd and hrg models .",
    "the extracted freeze - out parameters are in agreement with the thermal model parametrization . in the upcoming rhic bes - ii program",
    "proposed to be in 2019 - 20 , experimental programs at fair and nica with upgraded detector system will help to measure the fluctuation variable with reduced uncertainties on the measurements and may find the exact location of the critical point .",
