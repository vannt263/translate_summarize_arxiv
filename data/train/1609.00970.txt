    "antimatter asymmetry@xcite . in general , this scalar condensate is unstable with respect to fragmentation into q - balls @xcite , which can be entirely stable and can play the role of dark matter @xcite .",
    "this scenario offers a common origin to ordinary matter and dark matter .",
    "dark - matter q - balls have relatively large masses , and , therefore , very small number densities . a direct detection of such dark matter is extremely challenging @xcite .",
    "these flat directions are only flat at tree level , and in general they are lifted by non - renormalizable terms in the potential coming from loop corrections and gut or planck - scale physics , taking the form of polynomials in the squark fields and their conjugates @xmath0 suppressed by some energy scale @xmath1 . if @xmath2 , then baryon number is no longer conserved , fulfilling one of the sakharov conditions for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the same operators allow q - ball to decay via processes that do not conserve the baryon number .",
    "if supersymmetric q - balls make up the main component of dark matter , limits on their lifetimes ( namely @xmath3 ) restrict the set of operators in the lifting potential in order to prevent their decay on too short of a timescale . however , one can set additional constraints on the types of operators in the lifting potential by examining the effects of a star infected with a q - ball . a q - ball composed of squarks in the presence of baryonic matter",
    "absorbs the net baryon number and radiates pions on its surface @xcite . for a main sequence star",
    ", a q - ball should pass through with a negligible change in velocity , due to the relatively low density of the star , and high inertia of the q - ball . a neutron star , however , has a high enough density of baryons that a collision with a q - ball should slow it to a crawl , at which point it would sink to the center of the star and begin to consume it from the inside out @xcite .",
    "if the q - ball is absolutely stable , it grows without bound as it absorbs more neutrons until either the neutron star is completely consumed , or the q - ball collapses into a black hole , causing the neutron star to collapse .",
    "either way , we find the star dies relatively quickly on cosmological timescales , on the order of @xmath4 years.however , the baryon number violation at a high scale is both plausible and necessary for the affleck - dine baryogenesis to work . in the presence of baryon - number violating operators , the growth of a q - ball inside a neutron star may be stymied by the baryon number destruction in the q - ball interior , which becomes important once the q - ball vev reaches a certain magnitude . in this paper , we will re - examine the astrophysical bounds taking into account the baryon number violating operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : qballstates ] provides a brief review of allowed q - ball states , section [ sec : decayrates ] explains the machinery of calculating the decay rate of the q - ball , section [ sec : qball+ns ] details the interaction of the q - ball with a neutron star , and section [ sec : baryonevolution ] explains the evolution of the baryon number within the q - ball and star . section [ sec : limits ] takes this analysis and applies limits to the class of baryon - violating operators .",

    "this happens when @xmath30 .",

    "the vev hits a wall when it reaches its maximum at @xmath31 and can not climb any higher , so we can approximate the scalar potential near this point as @xmath32 since the vev is constrained to be near @xmath33 , we can use the thin wall approximation . substituting into equation [ eq : energyfunctional ] and fixing @xmath31",

    "we would now like to calculate the decay rate of the quanta of the q - ball to other particles .",
    "the decay of q - balls to neutrinos was first treated as an evaporation phenomenon due to the pauli exclusion principle preventing decays in the interior of the q - ball @xcite .",
    "bosons present no such obstacles , and therefore decays to scalar and vector particles can occur throughout the volume of the q - ball . much additional work has been done calculating the decay rates and energy spectra of these types of decays @xcite . however , these previous studies , while perfectly general and applicable to this problem , are mathematically cumbersome . in addition , the interesting feature of the decay processes captured by these treatments ( namely evaporation and the limiting decay rate ) are not relevant to the problem at hand . in this situation , we can utilize a simpler method of calculating the decay rate that uses regular perturbation theory ( with some extra steps ) .      the probability for an initial state @xmath37 to evolve into the final state @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 . in the case of decays from a q - ball , we are interested in the situation where the initial state is simply the scalar condensate describing the q - ball : @xmath40 . since the condensate is a persistent feature of the vacuum , the expectation value of the fields operator is simply the wave function : @xmath41 , a c - number function . @xmath42",
    "is the solution to the classical equations of motion in vacuum , which admit q - ball solutions .",
    "therefore , we can decompose the field operator into a classical and quantum part : @xmath43 ( we later employ a different decomposition in order to properly separate the field into its mass eigenstates , but it is conceptually similar to this one ) .",
    "however , we are interested in how the q - ball decays , so we must consider the state in which the scalar condensate is in the background of an interacting vacuum : @xmath44 .",
    "the transition probability to any set of final state particles @xmath45 is then @xmath46 . using the single - particle expansion of the final particle states",
    "@xmath47 the transition probability is then @xmath48 instead of using arbitrary wave functions as the final state , we can simply use the states of definite momentum , as is typically done , so that @xmath49 . in this case , the differential transition probability is then @xmath50 the matrix element @xmath51 can be computed perturbatively just as is normally done in qft , except that we have to keep in mind the expansion of the scalar field operator @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a bit of a complication , since working in the momentum space involves a fourier transform of @xmath52 , introducing an additional integral which consumes some of the delta functions that normally can be separated from the scattering amplitude @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , there is also no integral over the impact parameter since there are no collisions involved in this decay process . depending on the number of interaction vertices in the process , we find the matrix element can be written schematically as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the q - ball energy per particle ( chemical potential ) , @xmath56 is the number of q - ball quanta consumed by the decay ( determined by the number of external legs attached to the condensate ) , and @xmath57 is a  reduced \" matrix element .",
    "the delta function enforces global energy conservation , and although momentum is conserved at each vertex internal to the diagram , global momentum is not .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the existence of the condensate breaks the spatial translation invariance of the vacuum , and therefore momentum is no longer a conserved quantity , the condensate instead absorbing the difference , similar to how a crystal lattice will absorb the recoil from a nuclear decay in the mssbauer effect .",
    "now , one will find that equation [ eq : probabilitydensity ] implicitly contains the square of a delta function , which is a little troubling .",
    "however , integration over the final state momenta will eat up one of the delta functions , leaving a @xmath58 , which is proportional to an infinite period of time @xmath59 , in the sense that the limit of @xmath60 is this quantity , so that stripping this from the rhs gives us a probability per unit time per unit phase space ; in other words , the differential decay rate @xmath61 this method has wide applicability in calculating the decay of condensates and background fields , as the final state particles can be of either bosonic or fermionic type ( the initial states can only be bosonic since fermions ca nt form condensates ) .",
    "the authors have also verified in the limit that the condensate wave function is that of a single zero - momentum particle @xmath62 , the fourier transform of which is a zero - momentum delta function , the decay rate reduces to that of a familiar single particle decay , as one would expect .",
    "the only drawback of this method is that it can not handle decays that significantly alter the condensate wave function since @xmath52 would then be different in the initial and final states and it would not be appropriate to expand around .",
    "thankfully , we will only be interested in decays involving @xmath63 from q - balls with @xmath64 , so the change in charge per decay is entirely negligible .",
    "as briefly mentioned earlier , we would like to use a decomposition of the field operator that respects the mass eigenstates of the theory .",
    "for a theory with an unbroken u(1 ) , a polar decomposition @xmath65 shows that the scalar potential depends only on the radial field @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , this field is massive with the same mass as the original complex field : @xmath67 .",
    "the potential is completely devoid of any terms containing @xmath68 however , due to the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "this angular degree of freedom is therefore a massless goldstone boson of the theory ( inside the q - ball it picks up a small mass due to the fact that has a minimum wavelength @xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore we need a representation of the phonon operator that captures perturbations around the condensate while keeping the mass eigenstates separate .",
    "this leads us to consider the decomposition of the phonon field into a radial and angular part : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and the @xmath72 refers to the higher - order terms in the taylor expansion of the exponential .",
    "although there is no way to invert the full relationship for @xmath73 and @xmath74 in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the expansion to linear order can be inverted , and this gives us an approximate dictionary between the different phonon operators : @xmath77 unfortunately , we can not simply substitute the above relationships into the lagrangian because these are only correct to first order ; we must expand around @xmath78 and @xmath79 in each term , then do a taylor expansion in the exponential .",
    "the @xmath75 operator is complex , yet is not charged under the @xmath80 of the theory inside the q - ball because @xmath81 is not a symmetry of the lagrangian unless @xmath82 ( in which case we are outside the q - ball ) . neither of the @xmath73 or @xmath74 is charged either , so a charged current can not exist in the interior unless it is via bulk motion of , or interaction with , the condensate field @xmath52 .",
    "we will now use the method of sections [ ssec : mathematicalbackground ] and [ ssec : masseigenstates ] in order to derive the matrix element for decay of several q - ball quanta to phonons within the q - ball ( the feynman diagram representation of which is given by figure [ fig : condensatefeynmandiagram ] ) .",
    ", whereas external lines on the right are the phonons produced from the decay .",

    "we consider the lifting potential discussed earlier and expand it in polar form : @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",

    "we substitute in the q - ball wave function to the fourier transform @xmath95 : @xmath96\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we use an interesting geometric argument to solve this integral .",
    "since @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we observe that ( besides the delta functions ) , the integral is hyper - spherically symmetric in the @xmath99-dimensional @xmath100-space .",
    "the three delta functions each define a hyperplane in this space , the union of which is a @xmath101-dimensional hypersurface which is a subspace of the larger @xmath99-dimensional space .",
    "this hypersurface is displaced from the origin by the vector @xmath102 ( notice the hyperplane defined by @xmath103 has a unit normal vector of @xmath104 and is displaced from the origin by a distance of @xmath105 ) .",
    "this integral therefore represents a spherically symmetric gaussian integral over a @xmath101-dimensional space offset from the origin by @xmath106 .",
    "we can therefore rotate our coordinate system so that @xmath106 points in the new  @xmath107 \" direction and transform to a type of  hypercylindrical coordinates \" : @xmath108 where the coordinates @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are euclidean and a specification of @xmath112 constrains one to the hypersurface . then",
    ", we simply perform the spherically symmetric integral over this surface : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the solid angle of the @xmath115-sphere , and the remaining integral can be written in terms of a gamma function as well ( it actually cancels with the one from @xmath116 ) .",
    "after the dust has settled , the matrix element is found to be @xmath117\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the number of q - ball quanta that decay in each event ( and thereby amount of charge violation ) can be read off from the delta function , and is @xmath118 , as expected .",
    "one important note is that since @xmath119 , the condensate can not decay to @xmath66 s unless @xmath120 , which requires the amount of charge violation to be very high .",
    "decays to @xmath88 s might appear to proceed unimpeded , however , because they are massless .",
    "however , these phonons pick up a small mass from two different sources .",
    "first , as mentioned before , because the phonons are confined to the q - ball , they are essentially standing waves with a maximum ( compton ) wavelength of @xmath121 , which implies a minimum rest energy @xmath122 . since in a thick - wall q - ball @xmath123",
    ", we have @xmath124 , which is small , but still a significant fraction of @xmath55 !",
    "second , the baryon - violating term itself introduces a small mass , which we can see by expanding to second order in @xmath74 : @xmath125 \\hat{\\psi}^2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the quantity in square brackets can be identified with @xmath126 .",
    "not only is this mass small in magnitude compared with the first contribution , but it also has harmonic time dependence , and therefore averages out to zero over timescales longer than about @xmath127 .",
    "thus , it is safe to assume that the mass from the compton wavelength is the only mass that contributes .",
    "we now apply equation [ eq : differentialdecay ] to calculate the decay rate , focusing on decays to only the goldstone modes and setting @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we take the squared amplitude ( which can be simplified because the cross - terms are zero due to the conflicting delta functions ) , drop one of the delta functions , and integrate over the final state phase space : @xmath130 where @xmath131 for @xmath132 we can get an exact answer : @xmath133 however , using the relationships @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we can reduce the integral to something even simpler : @xmath136\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we will define the integral in square brackets as @xmath137 ( note @xmath138 and @xmath139 if @xmath140 or @xmath141 ) . because @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are integers and",
    "@xmath144 is a dimensionless number , we can simply tabulate all its possible values using numerical integration such as monte carlo .",
    "however , because of the delta function , we ca nt do mc until we integrate that out .",
    "we convert to spherical coordinates and separate the @xmath143th coordinate from the rest , then integrate over it to remove the delta function , leaving us with @xmath145 where the primed sums / products mean we sum / multiply over all coordinates except the @xmath143th , and @xmath146 some sample values of @xmath137 ( i ll restrict to @xmath147 and @xmath148 for now ) are : @xmath149 clearly , final states involving more phonons have a smaller amount of phase space volume .",
    "the exception is @xmath132 , which gets extra suppression from the fact that any decay involving one final state particle does not conserve momentum .",
    "it should be noted that repeated evaluation of the monte carlo shows that the uncertainty in these answers is quite large ; variation in the first digit is common , though the order of magnitude remains consistent over repeated evaluations .",
    "it turns out that this is not terribly important for computing the neutron star lifetimes ; variations of @xmath150 in @xmath144 translate to variations of @xmath151 in the lifetimes .",
    "this is because the dependence of @xmath152 on @xmath23 is most important .",
    "there is also a small imaginary part attached to some of these numbers which is not shown .",
    "this is from integrating over a region in phase space which is not kinematically allowed , and it does not contribute to the decay rate , so we can simply ignore it . if the dimension of the lifting potential is extremely high ( @xmath153 ) , then the exponential in the integrand becomes order unity , and we can reduce this even further by transforming to a dimensionless energy coordinate @xmath154 and integrating out all the angles .",
    "the integral @xmath137 approaches @xmath155 this can be calculated via monte carlo in a similar manner to equation [ eq : jmc ] .",
    "note that in this limit @xmath137 only depends on @xmath118 and @xmath143 .",
    "now , putting all of this together , we can express the decay rate to @xmath143 goldstone bosons as @xmath156 writing out @xmath20 , @xmath28 and @xmath55 in terms of @xmath23 ( see equations [ eq : flatdirection ] ) and lumping all the non - dimensional constants together , @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the mass scale associated with the potential energy density in the flat direction of the scalar potential ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "we can now simply tabulate the @xmath160 and have a semi - analytic expression for the decay rate that will be easy to use in the analysis of section [ sec : baryonevolution ] .",
    "we would now like to understand how a q - ball interacts with its host star in order to determine the neutron consumption rate . as explained in the work of kusenko , loveridge , and shaposhnikov ( kls ) @xcite , the transport mechanism of neutrons inside a neutron star is complicated and",
    "is not very well understood .",
    "the authors outline two different possible situations for neutron accretion , which we will summarize here for clarity .      as a rough estimate",
    ", kls assume the rate of neutron absorption is simply equal to the flux of neutrons moving across the surface of the q - ball . in this scenario ,",

    "this estimate for the absorption rate is likely too high , as it does not take into account the pressure backreaction from the pions and antineutrons produced on the surface of the q - ball .      using a couple different methods , kls determine the pressure at the center of the star in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately @xmath165 . for light degrees of freedom such as pions , electrons and neutrinos",
    ", this implies a temperature of about @xmath166 from the relation @xmath167 .",
    "this temperature can not be maintained by thermal effects alone , but can be maintained by the pions produced on the surface of the q - ball .",
    "the rate of pion loss to decay inside the star is given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the mean free path and neutral pion lifetime , respectively .",
    "they also assume @xmath171 in order to maintain pressure .",
    "each neutron only has enough mass and energy to supply about 4 - 5 pions , so the rate of neutron absorption is about that much lower , giving us @xmath172 this estimate is slightly lower than the raw neutron flux estimate and is a little more realistic .",
    "now that have expressions for both the growth rate and decay rate of the q - ball , we can set up a simple set of differential equations to model the evolution of the baryon number in both the q - ball and the neutron star : @xmath173 where @xmath174 . or , eliminating @xmath175 and assuming decays are dominated by a specific @xmath143 ( usually either 1 or 2 ) , we can put it in a more aesthetically pleasing form : @xmath176 where @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 ( @xmath180 unless @xmath143 is some ridiculously high number , which is unlikely ) . the initial conditions for this system",

    "the diagonal @xmath141 is ruled out because the stability of the q - ball causes it to grow without bound , quickly consuming the star . ]    as we can see , the diagonal where @xmath141 is ruled out , with a lifetime of about @xmath4 years .",
    "this is due to the fact that the q - ball is absolutely stable in this regime , and therefore grows without bound as it eats away at the neutron star , quickly consuming it .",
    "in fact , this is an upper limit on the lifetime ; the final charge of the q - ball in this situation is @xmath204 , which is beyond the critical charge for a flat direction q - ball to change into a curved direction type , which as mentioned before , has an even higher rate of neutron consumption .",
    "the highest charge for a q - ball with baryon - violating decays is only @xmath205 , well below the critical charge .",
    "interestingly , in the regions with operator dimension @xmath206 , the q - ball decays so quickly that it breaks down completely before the neutron star is consumed . as mentioned in the previous subsection ,",
    "q - balls in this regime are nt stable in free space anyway .",
    "we can see that as we move away from the @xmath141 diagonal ( increasing @xmath200 ) , the lifetime of the star begins to drop , then levels out , with the magnitude of the drop decreasing as the operator dimension increases . in order to study the effects of very high - dimension operators ( @xmath153 ) , we once again use equation [ eq : jmc ] to calculate @xmath137 and solve the baryon number evolution equations .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ fig : nslifetimeshighdim ] .     as a function of the charge violation per decay @xmath207 and the dimension of the operator in the lifting potential .",
    "the white region in the lower right corner is where @xmath208 , which is not allowed since it implies one of either @xmath56 or @xmath26 is negative . ]",
    "what we find is quite interesting : the lifetime appears to approach a limiting value around @xmath209 years as the operator dimension increases .",
    "the lifetime is roughly independent of @xmath200 , though it does drop slightly near @xmath210 .",
    "this appears to match the trend of figure [ fig : nslifetimes ] as the operator dimension is increased .",
    "we have shown here that q - balls can make up dark matter if baryon - violating terms of dimension greater than 5 are present in the scalar potential .",
    "this eliminates the neutron star bounds .",
    "the baryon number violation is also necessary for the affleck - dine mechanism to work . beyond this",
    ", there appears to be no restriction on these operators , even at very high dimension .",
    "the low level of baryon number violation does not affect the experimental limits based on icecube @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite and other direct detection experiments .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that q - balls may carry some electric charge @xcite , making them almost invisible to most direct - detection searches .",
    "( a positively charged q - ball can not destabilize nuclei because the coulomb repulsion prevents any strong interactions between non - relativistic q - balls and matter nuclei . )",
