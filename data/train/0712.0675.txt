    "conventional ( @xmath0 ) josephson junctions ( jjs ) in the ground state , have zero @xmath5 , the gauge invariant phase difference of the superconducting order parameters on each side of the barrier . however , in some cases a jj may have a ground state with @xmath5 equal to @xmath6 ( @xmath1jj ) .",
    "the possibility of a @xmath1jj was first pointed out theoretically in the tunneling through an oxide layer with magnetic impurities in sis junctions , because of negative josephson coupling @xcite .",
    "negative coupling also arises in jjs with ferromagnetic intermediate layers @xcite . in that case",
    "the state of the jj , i.e. , a @xmath0state or a @xmath1state depends sensitively on the sample design and the temperature @xcite .",
    "another realization of @xmath1jjs became possible due to the @xmath7wave symmetry of the order parameter in high@xmath8 superconductors .",
    "thus , @xmath1jjs were demonstrated using twist - tilt , and @xmath9 tilt @xmath10 grain boundary jjs @xcite .",
    "very recently , a new technique of tailoring the barrier of superconductor - insulator - ferromagnet - superconductor ( low @xmath11 ) junctions can be used for accurate control of the critical current densities of @xmath1jjs ( as well as @xmath0jjs and @xmath12 jjs ) @xcite .",
    "all these junctions are characterized by an intrinsic phase shift of @xmath6 in the current - phase relation or , in other words , an effectivelly negative critical current .    one - dimensional ( 1d ) discrete arrays of parallel biased @xmath0jjs for which both dimensions are smaller than the josephson length @xmath13 ( i.e. , small jjs ) , have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite .",
    "such systems represent an experimental realization of the spatially discrete sine - gordon ( sg ) lattice , whose dynamic behaviour has been modelled with the discrete sine - gordon ( dsg ) equation .",
    "that equation is formally equivalent to the frenkel - kontorova model , which describes the motion of a chain of interacting particles subjected to an external on - site sinusoidal potential @xcite .",
    "experiments and numerical simulations have shown that , even with large discreteness , the dynamics of a localized kink ( fluxon ) in the sg lattice exhibit some features of solitonic nature , close to the properties of the continuous sg solitons @xcite .",
    "however , discreteness also introduces a number of aspects in fluxon dynamics which have no counterparts in the continuum system .",
    "the experimental investigation of discrete jj arrays is a relevant issue in superconducting electronics because they are the basis of the so called phase - mode logic @xcite and of the rapid single - flux - quantum ( rsfq ) circuits @xcite , for the construction of superconducting quantum interference filters ( sqifs ) @xcite , as well as for developing high frequency mixers @xcite , or variable inductors and tunable filters @xcite .",
    "naturally , the next step in this field was to consider jj arrays comprising @xmath1jjs .",
    "the usage of @xmath1jjs as passive @xmath1shifters in rsfq circuits was recently suggested in reference @xcite , and realized in @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent studies ( both theoretical and experimental ) of jj arrays with @xmath1jjs have shown some novel features arising out of the interplay between @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs @xcite .",
    "for instance , when a @xmath14 kink is introduced in a hypothetical parallel array with alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs @xcite , it will break up into two separate @xmath1kinks .",
    "this effect is reffered to as `` fractionalization of a flux quantum '' and , surprisingly , it also appears in long continuous jjs with alternating @xmath15 and @xmath6 facets @xcite . in the limit of very short , randomly alternating @xmath15 and @xmath6 facets ,",
    "that problem has been studied in references @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath1jjs can now be formed in a variety of ways , a parallel array of alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs could , in principle , be made in the lab .",
    "it is worth noting that parallel jj arrays consisting of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 jjs were also studied as a model of long , faceted , high@xmath8 bicrystal jjs with high misorientation angle of the bicrystalline film ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate numerically the fluxon dynamics in a 1d , highly discrete array of alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs .",
    "we are mainly concerned with linear arrays , with open ended boundary conditions , and different ( even or odd ) total number of jjs . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the array model and typical ground states of such arrays , while in section 3 we present numerically obtained , typical current - voltage characteristics where zero field - like ( zf - like ) steps appear .",
    "we finish in section 4 with the conclusions .     and",
    "@xmath1jjs in parallel .",
    "solid lines show the superconducting electrodes , while the crosses and the crosses - in - box show the @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs , respectively . ]",
    "consider a 1d array of alternatingly @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs , which are connected in parallel via superconducting leads , as shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the hamiltonian function of this system in the simplest approximation , where all mutual inductances between different cells are neglected , is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the phase difference over the @xmath19th jj , @xmath20 is the critical current of the @xmath19th jj , @xmath21 is the dissipation coefficient due to quasiparticles crossing the barriers , @xmath22 is the coupling strength between nearest neighbouring jjs , with @xmath23 being the discreteness parameter , @xmath24 is the applied constant ( dc ) bias current assumed to be injected and extracted uniformly ( see figure 1 ) , and @xmath25 is the canonical variable conjugate to @xmath18 . for @xmath26",
    "that variable reduces to the ( normalized ) voltage - phase relation , @xmath27 , for the @xmath19th jj .",
    "since @xmath28 depends explicitly on time @xmath29 , it is obvious that it is not a constant of the motion .",
    "however , it is interesting that the system in consideration belongs in a certain class of systems having time - dependent hamiltonians , which may be useful when studying stability issues of specific solutions . for @xmath26 and @xmath30",
    "we get the simpler hamiltonian @xmath31 which has been used ( with @xmath32 ) to describe a harmonic chain of particles subjected to an external sinusoidal potential @xcite . in this context , the variable @xmath18 represents the displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position , and the three terms in the earlier hamiltonian @xmath33 are interpreted as the kinetic energy of the particles , the harmonic ( elastic ) interaction of the nearest neighbouring particles in the chain , and the interaction of the chain with an external on - site sinusoidal potential , respectively . if the ratio @xmath34 of the coefficients of the elastic coupling energy to the on - site potential energy is less than unity , then the system is considered to be highly discrete . in respect",
    "to kink propagation , the system is highly discrete if the kink width is of the order of lattice spacing @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath19dependent critical current @xmath20 is given in compact form by @xmath35 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) being the critical current of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) jjs . from equations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) we have that @xmath39 and @xmath40 for odd and even @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath20 may differ both in sign and magnitude for the @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs . from the hamiltonian function given in equation ( [ 1 ] )",
    "we get the equations @xmath42     vs plaquette number @xmath41 , for ( a ) a periodic array ( @xmath43 ) ;",
    "( b ) an open - ended array with even @xmath44 ( @xmath43 ) ; ( c ) an open - ended array with odd @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . ]    for a finite array with @xmath44 total number of jjs , @xmath48 .",
    "the earlier equations may also be obtained by applying kirchhoff laws in the equivalent electrical circuit @xcite , where each single jj is described by the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model . in this model",
    "the jj consists of a capacitive branch , a resistive branch , and a superconducting branch , all connected in parallel .",
    "equations ( [ 5 ] ) are written in the standard normalization form , i.e. @xmath49 is normalized to @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the spatial separation of neighbouring jjs , the temporal variable @xmath29 to the inverse plasma frequency @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is normalized to @xmath37 . then , @xmath54 in equations ( [ 5 ] ) , and @xmath38 actually represents the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "the voltage @xmath56 across the @xmath19th jj is normalized so that @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the flux quantum ( with @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the planck s constant and the electron charge , respectively ) .",
    "equation ( [ 5 ] ) is analogous to that deduced in reference @xcite in the context of analysis of zig - zag arrays @xcite .",
    "below we deal with arrays both with periodic and open ends , i.e. , annular and linear finite arrays , respectively .",
    "then , in both cases , the governing equations ( [ 5 ] ) remain the same for @xmath62 .",
    "the same equations are also valid at the end points @xmath63 and @xmath64 , if we define artificial phases @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 for periodic boundary conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xmath68 for open - ended boundary conditions .",
    "the integer @xmath69 in equation ( [ 66 ] ) is the number of @xmath14 fluxons trapped in the annular array .",
    "equations ( [ 5 ] ) are integrated with a standard fourth order runge - kutta algorithm with fixed time - stepping ( typically @xmath70 ) . in figure 2",
    "we plot the calculated normalized flux @xmath71 in each elementary cell ( plaquette ) as a function of the junction number @xmath41 , for three different arrays in their ground state : a periodic array ( figure 2(a ) ) , and open - ended arrays with even and odd @xmath44 ( figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) , respectively ) . in the former case the flux clearly alternates between two values of opposite sign and the same magnitude , the latter depending on the coupling constant @xmath34 , indicating that the flux lattice is actually periodic with a period of two elementary cells .",
    "we can thus define a new extented unit cell , with respect to the flux periodicity , which consists of two elementary cells .",
    "then , we can evaluate the ( normalized ) average flux in each of the extended cells , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 numbers the extended cell composed of the ( @xmath74)th and @xmath75th elementary cells .",
    "clearly , @xmath76 vs @xmath77 is a constant which equals to zero .",
    "the same remarks also hold for the open - ended arrays , both with even and odd @xmath44 , relatively far from the end jjs .",
    "for obtaining the current - voltage ( @xmath78 ) characteristics for an open - ended array , we initialize the system with @xmath79 and @xmath6 for @xmath41 odd and even , respectively , and @xmath80 for any @xmath41 at @xmath81 and @xmath30 .",
    "( the overdot denotes derivation with respect to the temporal variable . ) then equations ( [ 5 ] ) are integrated forward in time up to @xmath82 , by which time the system has reached a steady state .",
    "we then calculate the time averaged voltage @xmath83 across each jj by averaging over an additional @xmath84 dimensionless time - units , i.e. , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "the voltage of the array @xmath87 is obtained by averaging over all jjs , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "the dc bias @xmath24 is then increased by @xmath89 and the calculation is repeated , assuming as initial condition the steady state achieved in the previous calculation .",
    "we continue this procedure increasing @xmath24 by @xmath89 until @xmath90 , then decrease @xmath24 with same steps back to zero , obtaining the @xmath78 characteristics shown in figures 3 and 4 for even @xmath44(=100 ) and odd @xmath44(=101 ) , respectively ( @xmath91 for the curves in the main figures and @xmath92 for the curves in the insets ) .",
    "large hysteresis is observed in the high - voltage part ( @xmath93 ) of all characteristics in both figures , even though the damping coefficient is rather high ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "small hysteretic effects are also apparent in the low - voltage parts ( not shown for clarity ) .",
    "apparently , the high - voltage characteristics in figures 3 and 4 for same @xmath34 are practically the same . the solutions on the high voltage branches have been discussed in detail in reference @xcite , and it seems that they are not significantly affected by the choice of boundary conditions . here , we focus on the the low - voltage parts of those characteristics , which exhibit significant quantitative differences for odd and even @xmath44 .    that can be seen by comparing the insets of figures 3 and 4 , which display a magnified portion of the corresponding low - voltage characteristics seen in the main figures .",
    "there we can see the appearence of current steps , similar with those observed in @xmath0jj arrays ( see for example references @xcite ) .",
    "those steps are the discrete counterparts of the zero - field steps ( zfss ) appearing in the @xmath78 characteristics of continuous , long @xmath0jj , due to fluxon resonant motion . in this case",
    "the propagating fluxons are @xmath4kinks and their multitudes , while single @xmath1kinks are unstable . in a continuous , long @xmath0jj , with equivalent normalized length @xmath95 ,",
    "the normalized voltage at maximum fluxon velocity @xmath96 of the first zfs would be @xmath97 for @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the first half - integer zfs ( zfs1/2 ) would have @xmath98 , while the second integer zfs ( zfs2 ) and second half - integer zfs ( zfs3/2 ) would have @xmath99 and @xmath100 , repectively .",
    "the fluxon width decreases ( i.e. , the fluxon size contracts ) with increasing velocity .",
    "thus , in the discrete system , a fluxon can not reach the maximum velocity of its continuous counterpart , since its contracted size can not be smaller than @xmath23 . in each of the insets in figures 3 and 4",
    "there are two zfs - like branches with @xmath47 , with maximum @xmath87 ( defined at the top of the steps ) equal to @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "thus , the steps in the inset of figure 3 can be identified with the discrete counterparts of half - integer zfss ( namely with zfs@xmath105 and zfs@xmath106 ) , while those in the inset of figure 4 with the discrete counterparts of integer zfss ( zfs@xmath107 and zfs@xmath108 ) .",
    "inspection of the time evolution of the phases ( not shown ) reveals that the zfs@xmath105-like branch for even @xmath44(=100 ) is due to a @xmath1kink propagating in the array , on a staggered phase background . in figure 5",
    "we show the instantaneous profile of the normalized flux as a function of the plaquette number @xmath41 , and @xmath76 as a function of the number of the extended cell @xmath77 , for @xmath109 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic background in the flux ( figure 5(a ) ) obscures the picture , but its proper elimination with the doubling of the unit cell along with the definition of @xmath76 makes things more clear ( figure 5(b ) ) .",
    "then , in figure 5b we see clearly the discrete @xmath1kink in a form which is the discrete counterpart of the spatial phase derivative in continuous systems .",
    "also apparent they are small oscillations behind the @xmath1kink , a phenomenon known from @xmath0jj arrays @xcite , where moving @xmath4kinks excite linear oscillating modes of the array ( cherenkov radiation ) . those oscillations , however , get strongly damped and die out fast away from the kink . in figure 6 the same quantities for an array with the same parameters but odd @xmath44(=101 ) are plotted for @xmath109 on the zfs@xmath107-like branch . here",
    "we always have a @xmath1kink and a @xmath1antikink pair .",
    "cherenkov radiation is also apparent here ( figure 6(b ) ) behind both the propagating @xmath1kinks .",
    "inserting one ( or more ) @xmath4kink(s ) in both the even and odd @xmath44 arrays , we get higher order zfs - like branches . the zfs@xmath106- and zfs@xmath108-like branches for even and odd @xmath44 ,",
    "respectively , are shown in the insets of figure 3 and 4 , respectively ( only for @xmath47 ) .",
    "those branches were obtained by inserting one @xmath4kink in the arrays .",
    "again , inspection of the phases reveals that the @xmath4kink is fractionalized into two closely spaced but clearly separated @xmath1kinks which , however , are not identical .",
    "the snapshot in figure 7 shows the normalized flux as a function of the plaquette number @xmath41 , and @xmath76 as a function of the number of the extended cell @xmath77 , for @xmath109 on the zfs@xmath106-like branch in the inset of figure 3 ( @xmath43 , even ) .",
    "the fractionalized @xmath4kink at the right of figure 7(b ) , now coexists with the single @xmath1kink in the array . the corresponding figure ( figure 8) for the zfs@xmath108-like branch in the inset of figure 4 ( @xmath45 , odd ) , shows the fractionalized @xmath4kink along with a @xmath1kink - @xmath1antikink pair .",
    "the direction of motion of the fractionalized @xmath4kinks depends on their polarity when they are inserted in the array .",
    "these kinks , either the single one or the ones obtained by fractionalization , behave in many aspects like the usual @xmath4kinks .",
    "they get reflected by the ends changing their polarity , and interact completelly elastically , passing the one through the other without any apparent shape change . although not shown in figures 3 and 4 , the depinning current @xmath110 related to the peierls - nabarro potential , which the kink should overcome in order to start moving , is practically the same for @xmath44 even and odd .",
    "it increases with increasing discreteness ( decreasing @xmath34 ) , having the values @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "the fractionalized @xmath4kinks shown for a specific illustrative case in the figures 7(b ) and 8(b ) , are closely spaced and they move together in the same direction without changing their distance of separation .",
    "thus , they essentially form a single bound state which resembles the bunched fluxon state observed in @xmath0jj arrays @xcite .",
    "such a state results from strong interactions between kinks , which is mediated by their cherenkov `` tails '' . as a result",
    ", the cherenkov radiation behind the bunched state is strongly suppressed , which is exactly what we observe in our figures 7(b ) and 8(b ) .    in annular @xmath12 jj arrays with both even and odd @xmath44 , which satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ 66 ] )",
    ", the effect of fractionalization of @xmath4fluxons also appears @xcite . in that case",
    ", @xmath4fluxons can be inserted in the array either by setting @xmath69 to a nonzero integer value or by an appropriate initial condition . for both even and odd @xmath44 and a nonzero dc bias @xmath24 ( e.g. , @xmath109 ) ,",
    "there is a number of @xmath1kinks and @xmath1antikinks moving along the array such that the total flux is always an integer as required by the boundary conditions .",
    "they appear either as @xmath1kink - @xmath1antikink pairs moving in opposite directions , or as two bunched @xmath1kinks looking very much like those in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "however , we did not find single @xmath1kinks in this case , so that half - integer zf - like branches do not appear .",
    "thus , it seems that half - integer zf - like branches appear only for arrays with even @xmath44 satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ 6 ] ) , i.e. , for linear arrays .",
    "this is probably due to the amount of the net total flux in a @xmath12 jj array in its ground state . for arrays satisfying periodic boundary conditions",
    "without inserted flux , with either odd or even @xmath44 , the ground state is always arranged such that the total flux is equal to zero .",
    "apparently , this is not always the case for open - ended boundary conditions . for odd @xmath44",
    "there is an even number of elementary cells in the array , so that the contributions from all cells exactly cancel , resulting in zero total flux .",
    "however , for even @xmath44 there is an odd number of elementary cells in the array , and the total flux attains a nonzero value ( approximatelly equal to @xmath115 in figure 2(b ) ) . with increasing bias current above the peirls - nabarro barrier , that ground state becomes unstable against the formation of a @xmath1kink .",
    "dynamic simulations for such @xmath12 jj arrays with periodic boundary conditions have been performed in reference @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath4kinks fractionalize into a pair of @xmath1kinks in certain regions of @xmath116 space .",
    "however , zf - like steps on the current - voltage characteristics are not discussed .",
    "although a @xmath12 jj array is still hypothetical , it can be possibly realized with the existing technology .",
    "moreover , it has been argued @xcite that bicrystal grain boundary jjs with @xmath9 misorientations angle , form intrinsically an array of alternatingly @xmath15 and @xmath6 contacts . in this context , a discrete array of alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs has been used as a model to study the dynamics as well as the magnetic field dependence of such jjs @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we caclulated numerically the @xmath78 characteristics for a 1d discrete , planar array of small , parallel connected alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1jjs , which exhibit current steps in the low - voltage part . for even @xmath44 ,",
    "the maximum voltage of the steps ( evaluated at the top of each step ) is approximately two times smaller than the maximum voltage of the steps for odd @xmath44 .",
    "comparison with the continuous long jj , helps in identifying those steps as half - integer and integer zfs - like steps for even and odd @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "inspection of the phases and the fluxes reveals that in both cases the system supports @xmath1kinks , either a single @xmath1kink or a @xmath1kink - @xmath1antikink pair for even and odd @xmath44 , respectively , which can propagate in the array .",
    "moreover , any @xmath4kink inserted in the array is fractionalized into two , generally different @xmath1kinks , which propagate together in the array along with the single @xmath1kink or the @xmath1kink - @xmath1antikink pair , for even and odd @xmath44 , respectively , giving rise to higher order half - integer and integer zfs - like branches . in the continuum",
    ", half - integer zfss have been observed experimentally in not very long @xmath12 jjs due to the hopping of the semifluxons @xcite .",
    "similar zfs - like branches can be found in rather wide parameter range .",
    "the case with @xmath47 , for which the system is already highly discrete , was chosen only for better illustration of the half - integer zfss .",
    "those steps can also be found even for low damping ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) , as well as for higher damping ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) , which is more appropriate for high - temperature superconductor jj arrays @xcite . also , they may exist even for slightly different critical currents ( i.e. , for @xmath119 for even @xmath44 ) .",
    "dynamic states such as those described above could in principle be detected by low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ) imaging @xcite .",
