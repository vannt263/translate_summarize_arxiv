    "more and more high - resolution images show that debris disks often take the form of rings , sometimes narrow , sometimes eccentric .",
    "well - resolved examples include hr4796 @xcite , fomalhaut @xcite , hd 181327 @xcite , @xmath3 reticuli @xcite , hd 202628 @xcite , and hd 115600 @xcite .",
    "these rings may indicate the presence of hidden planets , which can clear the central cavities in the rings and also excite the ring eccentricities via secular perturbations @xcite .    at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "regions of an eccentric disk near pericenter appear brighter because they receive more flux from the host star .",
    "@xcite named this phenomenon `` pericenter glow '' and developed a model for an eccentric debris ring interacting with a single planetary perturber .",
    "their model disk consists of massless particles whose eccentricities differ only in the direction of the free eccentricity .",
    "the resulting ring suffices to explain the offset in the solar zodiacal cloud from the sun and to fit observations of several debris disks , yielding constraints on the disks forced eccentricity and the masses of the hidden planetary perturbers .",
    "however , variations in the disk surface density also affect its apparent brightness , and in a steady - state disk the density should peak at apocenter simply because typical orbit velocities are slowest there . though modeling done by @xcite predicted a brightness enhancement at pericenter for hr 4796 at 18.2  @xmath4 m , their disk model showed a 2% density enhancement at apocenter .",
    "analogous apocentric density enhancements occur in more recent dynamical models of eccentric planets interacting with disks ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , submillimeter observations of the very well - observed eccentric fomalhaut disk consistently suggest apocentric brightness enhancements .",
    "jcmt images of fomalhaut by @xcite show slight enhancements of the flux near apocenter ; these enhancements are less than the quoted uncertainty in the photometry , but they appear in both 450  @xmath4 m and 850  @xmath4 m bands .",
    "when @xcite imaged the fomalhaut disk at 350  @xmath4 m using the sharc ii ( submillimeter high angular resolution camera ii ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory , they found that the ring has an apocentric enhancement of approximately 14% in integrated column density .",
    "more recently , @xcite imaged fomalhaut s disk at 7  mm with the atca and noted that the lobe of the disk near apocenter `` ... appears to be more extended , showing two possible asymmetric structures toward east and south . ''",
    "the highest resolution alma images of fomalhaut by @xcite at 350  ghz ( 1  mm ) also show enhanced flux near apocenter in the maps corrected for the single - dish beam .    here",
    "we describe a new model for debris rings that illustrates the wavelength dependence in the apocenter / pericenter flux ratio due to the competing effects of azimuthal asymmetries in dust density and stellar illumination .",
    "our primary interest here is mid - infrared and longer wavelengths , so we focus on dust particles and planetesimals large enough to avoid radiation pressure effects and consider only absorbed and re - radiated , rather than scattered , emission . in section [ sec :",
    "semianalytic ] , we begin by describing a semi - analytic model for estimating the surface density of a steady - state distribution of collisionless planetesimals and show that the density of a dust ring varies with longitude and peaks at apocenter . in section [ sec : smack ] , we verify this result for a collisional ring using smack @xcite , a numerical model of debris disk evolution that incorporates both collisions and dynamics in 3d .",
    "finally in section [ sec : rerad ] , we combine a simple dust reradiation model with our models of surface density to simulate the brightness of the fomalhaut and @xmath2 eridani rings , and demonstrate that the ratio between pericenter and apocenter flux varies with wavelength .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the implications for future observations of eccentric rings in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the surface brightness of an optically thin debris disk depends on the underlying spatial distribution of the dust as well as on the dust particles absorption , reradiation , and scattering properties . in this section ,",
    "we use basic orbit geometry and a simple monte carlo simulation to estimate the surface density of a eccentric ring of collisionless particles and its dependence on longitude from pericenter .",
    "we first estimate the linear number density , @xmath5 , of an eccentric ring of particles as a function of longitude , @xmath6 , in the ring .",
    "@xmath7 is the most relevant quantity for the many images of disks that are unresolved in the radial direction .",
    "we assume that the particles form an annulus about the star , and that their eccentricity , inclination , and semimajor axis distributions are centered respectively on values @xmath1 , 0 , @xmath8 and have widths @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 . because we are considering a ring that appears eccentric overall and has a fractional radial width no larger than @xmath12",
    ", we must constrain the longitude of pericenter @xmath13 to a distribution centered on @xmath14 with width @xmath15 also , we assume the particles orbital phases and longitudes of the ascending node are distributed uniformly .    for a single particle in a stable elliptical orbit given by @xmath16",
    "the time - averaged linear number density along the orbit is inversely proportional to the local keplerian velocity : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 here @xmath20 is simply the orbital velocity of a circular orbit with the same @xmath8 .",
    "we consider only mildly eccentric disks ( @xmath21 ) , so to lowest order in @xmath1 the linear number density in the disk scales as @xmath22 in short , because particles orbit faster at pericenter and slower at apocenter , their number density decreases at pericenter and increases at apocenter by the same fractional amount @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite also calculated @xmath7 by a somewhat different method and found a similar enhancement at apocenter .    in a disk of such particles ,",
    "the overall linear density @xmath7 is the sum of all the individual densities @xmath23 .",
    "for a disk with particle orbit elements within the ranges given above , the linear density dependence on @xmath6 should remain close to that of @xmath24 , that is , @xmath25 with slight variations due to the finite widths of the distributions of orbit elements .      to check our scaling argument above , we performed each monte carlo disk simulation by randomly drawing @xmath26 disk particle orbits from orbit element distributions as follows .",
    "the semimajor axes , eccentricities , longitudes of pericenter , and inclinations were drawn from gaussian distributions with center values and widths ( @xmath27 ) given by    * typical eccentricity @xmath1 and eccentricity width @xmath12 chosen for each disk ; * typical semimajor axis @xmath28 and semimajor axis width @xmath29 ; * typical longitude of pericenter @xmath14 and corresponding width @xmath30 given by equation  [ eqn : deltaomega ] ; * typical inclination @xmath31 and inclination width @xmath32 .",
    "the particles longitudes of the ascending node and mean anomalies were chosen from uniform distributions over @xmath33 .",
    "we then measured the linear density as a function of longitude for each simulation , an example of which is shown in figure  [ fig : lindensity ] . as expected , @xmath5 varies nearly sinusoidally with @xmath6 with amplitude about equal to the eccentricity .    in the above density calculations we assumed the grains",
    "are distributed uniformly along their orbits . in particular",
    ", we ignored azimuthal variations in dust production caused by differences in the frequency and severity of collisions between larger planetesimals induced , for example , by perturbations from planets orbiting in the system ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these should be unimportant in our work here on gravitationally bound particles in a steady state disk , since any effects of azimuthal variations in their production rate should smear out within an orbit period . in the next section",
    "we describe a numerical test of this effect .",
    "the semi - analytic model described in section [ sec : semianalytic ] assumes that the given ranges of orbit elements accurately represent a steady state disk . to test these assumption and the results of the semi - analytic model , we simulated the collisional and dynamical evolution of the planetesimals using smack @xcite .",
    "smack uses an n - body integrator to track the orbits of superparticles , clouds of parent bodies with a range of sizes .",
    "when two superparticles collide , smack updates the superparticles trajectories and size distributions to account statistically for collisions between their planetesimals and tracks the mass of dust ( < 1 mm in size ) produced in the collision .",
    "we modeled the evolution of a ring of planetesimals in orbit around a solar - mass star .",
    "the planetesimals were represented by 10,000 superparticles of uniform size whose orbital elements were initially uniformly distributed with the ranges in table  [ tab : initial ] .",
    "each superparticle represented a size distribution of planetesimals with range and slope given in table  [ tab : initial ] .",
    "we set the initial vertical optical depth of the ring to @xmath34 .",
    "while the semi - analytic model includes the eccentric ring alone , in order to induce and maintain an eccentricity in the smack model we added a 3 @xmath35 planet to the system at semimajor axis 50 au with eccentricity 0.1 , then evolved the system for @xmath36 yr .",
    "lc semimajor axis ( @xmath8 ) & 50 - 100 au + eccentricity ( @xmath1 ) & 0.0 - 0.2 + inclination ( @xmath37 ) & 0.0 - 0.1 + longitude of ascending node ( @xmath38 ) & 0-@xmath39 + argument of pericenter ( @xmath40 ) & 0-@xmath39 + mean anomaly & 0-@xmath39 + size distribution index ( @xmath41 ) & @xmath42 + planetesimal sizes & 1  mm to 10  cm + optical depth & @xmath34 + number of superparticles & @xmath43    a snapshot of the simulation at this point shows that most of the superparticle eccentricities are distributed in a single roughly symmetric peak with half - width @xmath44 , while perhaps 10% form a tail extending to larger eccentricities ( 0.3 to 0.5 ) .",
    "the peak eccentricity value is about 0.12 , the median is about 0.14 , and the mean is about 0.15 .",
    "this distribution is broadly similar to our semi - analytic model assumptions except in that @xmath45 rather than @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding normalized disk linear density is shown in figure [ fig : lindensity ] and is roughly sinusoidal with a peak at apocenter and amplitude about equal to the median eccentricity .",
    "again , this is broadly consistent with our semi - analytic and mc model predictions .",
    "as we would expect , the inclusion of collisions in the smack model does not strongly affect the normalized linear density .",
    "by definition the eccentric disk has some steady - state finite eccentricity @xmath1 that persists regardless of the collisions ; the keplerian orbit shape required by this @xmath1 sets the linear density variation with longitude .",
    "also , because the optical depth is much less than unity , any non - uniformity in dust production spreads around the disk much faster than dust can accumulate at a given longitude .     as a function of longitude @xmath6 in our simulated debris disks . smack model data is the thin red line ; mc model data is the solid blue line ; the @xmath47 we predict analytically is the dashed black line .",
    "the median eccentricity of the smack model disk is @xmath48 and its eccentricity width is @xmath49 ; the same @xmath1 and @xmath12 were used in the mc model disk shown here .",
    "both sets of model data were normalized to their respective mean values .",
    "@xmath48 was also used for the @xmath47 curve . while the mc model appears to be a very slightly better match to the smack model data than the cosine curve",
    " the root mean square deviation between the smack and mc models is about 2% smaller than that between the smack model and the cosine  all three agree well overall .",
    "note that no fitting was performed ; the normalized model data are simply overplotted along with the cosine . ]",
    "we have used semi - analytic and smack modeling to simulate the density of the dust ring produced by an eccentric parent body ring and showed that the orbital geometry of the dust produces a peak in surface density at apocenter .",
    "the observed flux from the dust is therefore subject to two competing effects : this higher number density at apocenter and the higher temperature at pericenter discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "we now combine our semi - analytic and smack results with a simple radiative equilibrium model for dust emission to study the disk emission as a function of longitude at different wavelengths .",
    "we apply this surface brightness model to two well - observed disks : fomalhaut and @xmath2 eridani .",
    "we assume a passively heated disk containing dust of sizes @xmath50 with size distribution @xmath51 .",
    "we assume the disk is optically thin so that the thermal equilibrium condition for each grain is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the orbital radius , @xmath54 is the dust s effective temperature , and the absorptivity @xmath55 is 1 when @xmath56 and scales as @xmath57 otherwise .",
    "we solve this iteratively for sizes @xmath58 over a grid of wavelengths @xmath59 including the star s blackbody peak and sum over the sizes @xmath58 , with weights assigned according to @xmath60 , to find the flux at each of the desired wavelengths .      because it is so well - observed at wavelengths from uv to mm - wave radio , the fomalhaut disk ( eccentricity @xmath610.1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides an excellent test for our models . as discussed in section [ sec : introduction ] , previous works have consistently found that fomalhaut exhibits pericenter glow  i.e. , is brightest at its southeast limb  at wavelengths shorter than about 250  @xmath4 m ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , observations at longer submillimeter wavelengths consistently suggest that the northwest limb appears brighter than would be expected in a uniform ring @xcite .",
    "we applied our dust reradiation model to the fomalhaut system using stellar temperature @xmath62  k , stellar radius @xmath63  cm , disk semimajor axis @xmath64 au , radial width @xmath6120  au , and eccentricity 0.1 . to approximate the results of our semi - analytic model , we vary the linear mass density of the disk sinusoidally with longitude with amplitude 0.1 ( simulating a disk with eccentricity @xmath610.1 ) .",
    "we explored a grid of absorptivity laws @xmath65 and dust size distributions @xmath66 to predict the apocenter / pericenter glow from visual to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig : fomalhautmodels ] shows some examples of our results .",
    "each panel shows the flux as a function of longitude , integrated over the radial width of the disk and normalized to pericenter , for 12 different wavelengths shown as different - colored curves . at the longer wavelengths , the simulated ring exhibits apocenter glow rather than pericenter glow .",
    "the location of the peak in flux shifts from apocenter ( longitude = @xmath67 ) to pericenter ( longitude = 0 ) with decreasing wavelength .",
    "the shortest wavelength to show apocenter glow in figure [ fig : fomalhautmodels ] is typically 160 or 70  @xmath4 m .",
    "we show a summary view of the apocenter / pericenter flux contrast in figure [ fig : fluxampfomalhaut ] , which displays the range of apocenter / pericenter flux ratios occurring across our grid of models as a function of wavelength .",
    "again , the modeled fluxes were integrated over the radial width of the disk , since azimuthal width variations are not well resolved in the images . here , models exhibiting pericenter glow lie below the black dotted line while models with apocenter glow lie above it . at short wavelengths ,",
    "all our models exhibit pericenter glow , while at long wavelengths , they all exhibit apocenter glow .",
    "this illustrates the competition between higher temperatures at pericenter discussed in detail by @xcite , which for fomalhaut affect smaller particles more strongly and dominate in the shorter - wavelength emission , and the higher densities at apocenter , whose signature emerges strongly in the long - wavelength emission .",
    "far - infrared and submillimeter observations of fomalhaut appear broadly consistent with the range of apocenter / pericenter flux ratios our models predict , though flux ratio values based on alma and atca observations longward of 350  @xmath4 m are currently not precise enough to include in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxampfomalhaut ] .    a sufficiently large beam can dilute the effect of apocenter glow or blur it with background galaxies or other disk features like clumps , or even disk ansae , which themselves can be limb - brightened if the disk is not face - on .",
    "for example , in their discussion of pericenter glow in the keck image of hr  4796 from @xcite , @xcite calculate the effects of beam size and study the disappearance of disk asymmetry as pericenter / apocenter moves away from the disk ansae .",
    "because the beam size in the fomalhaut images is much smaller relative to the disk size than in the @xcite hr 4796 observations , we believe these dilution / confusion effects are less important for the fomalhaut data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed both sets of disk images appear ring - shaped rather than dumbbell - shaped / double - lobed as in the earlier hr 4796 images . also , for fomalhaut @xcite measure the disk major axis to coincide within 1 degree with the line of nodes in the sky plane , so it is highly unlikely that pericenter orientation masks the pericenter / apocenter flux ratio .    in these relatively well - resolved images",
    "we believe we can reasonably estimate the uncertainty in the flux ratio due to beam size by convolving a one - dimensional gaussian of width equal to the beam radius with a cosine representing the sinusoidal flux variation with longitude and quoting the difference in the pre- and post - convolution amplitudes . in order to compensate here for the apparent increase in flux at the disk ansae due to fomalhaut s 66@xmath68 inclination , we convolve the cosine with a one - dimensional gaussian of width equal to the beam radius divided by @xmath69 . for the _ herschel _ data this gives an extra flux uncertainty of @xmath615% of the difference between the pericenter and apocenter fluxes at 70 microns and @xmath6113% of this difference at 160 microns , smaller than the size of the plot symbols . @xcite incorporated beam / orientation effects in their data analysis so we infer they are included in the quoted uncertainties3% , which is comparable to that of @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in our modeling and analysis we simply adopt the result and uncertainty reported by @xcite ; we assume their analysis correctly accounted for any effects the deconvolution may have had on the relative flux , as necessary . ] .",
    "precisely where the observed flux ratios fall among our models can be a revealing diagnostic of disk properties .",
    "figure [ fig : fomalhautmodels160 ] shows the pericenter to apocenter flux ratio at 70 and at 160  @xmath4 m for our fomalhaut models as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath41 .",
    "herschel _ image of the fomalhaut disk at 70  @xmath4 m shows pericenter glow with an apocenter / pericenter flux ratio of about 0.7 @xcite .",
    "this value corresponds approximately to the line @xmath71 . at 160  @xmath4 m",
    ", the fomalhaut ring also shows pericenter glow @xcite , but the derived apocenter / pericenter flux ratio is about 0.89 , corresponding approximately to the line @xmath72 .",
    "observations of fomalhaut at 7  mm by @xcite provide an additional constraint : @xmath73 . combining these constraints with our findings above from the _ herschel _ 70- and 160-@xmath4 m data and our models yields the range @xmath74 to 1.7 , somewhat higher than the @xmath75 obtained by @xcite in their fomalhaut model .",
    "large values of @xmath70 often point to a lack of larger , millimeter - sized grains in the grain distribution .",
    "for example , in the outer regions of t  tauri disks where grain growth has not yet occurred , @xmath70 is often in the range of 1.7 - 2 @xcite .",
    "the millimeter dust opacity slope for the ism yields @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "however , the fomalhaut system is too old for lack of grain growth to be likely . explaining the fomalhaut disk s strong pericenter glow may require additional physics not included in our models , for example radiation from unbound grains or planet - disk interactions more complex than those we considered ( e.g.  resonant dynamics ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that unbound grains contribute about a quarter of the non - stellar flux in their 70  @xmath4 m fomalhaut system simulations .",
    "finally , 350  @xmath4 m observations by @xcite using sharc ii at the cso indicate somewhat stronger apocenter glow than our models predict . either a very steep size distribution ( @xmath77 ) , a very shallow absorptivity law ( @xmath78 ) or , perhaps least unlikely , a larger eccentricity @xmath79 is required in our models to reproduce the @xcite result .",

    "figure  [ fig : fluxampsmalldisk ] illustrates that this wavelength range is particularly sensitive to pericenter glow .",
    "we predict apocenter / pericenter flux ratios as small as 0.1 in this range for dust emitting via the highly temperature - sensitive wien law .",
    "_ alma _ , on the other hand , will operate at wavelengths from 3 mm to 400@xmath4 m , primarily continuing to detect apocenter glow . _",
    "alma _ images will be especially useful because , as figures  [ fig : fluxampfomalhaut ] , [ fig : fluxampepseri ] , [ fig : fluxampsmalldisk ] show , the apocenter / pericenter flux ratio becomes insensitive to dust properties at millimeter wavelengths . for a fixed disk mass , changes in @xmath41 and @xmath70 mostly affect the flux contributed by the smallest particles : increasing @xmath41 increases the number of very small particles , while increasing @xmath70 decreases the flux reradiated at wavelengths larger than the particle size",
    ". however , for the longest wavelengths , @xmath101 , the flux from small particles becomes negligible .",
    "to lowest order the millimeter apocenter / pericenter flux ratio therefore depends only on the apocenter / pericenter temperature and density contrasts .",
    "the largest bodies radiate efficiently and have effective temperature @xmath102 where we assume the star is a blackbody with effective temperature @xmath103 and radius @xmath104 and , in the last step , apply eq .  [ eqn : r ] with @xmath105 ( top sign ) for pericenter and @xmath106 for apocenter ( bottom sign ) . together with eq .",
    "[ eqn : ell ] evaluated at @xmath105 and @xmath67 , this gives @xmath107 where , as before , we take only lowest order terms in the eccentricity .",
    "the millimeter apocenter / pericenter flux ratio thus provides a direct estimate of the disk eccentricity .",
    "some systems , like @xmath2 eridani , no doubt contain additional structures that will complicate interpretation of their images .",
    "however , with this new understanding of apocenter glow and its wavelength dependence , we can begin future studies of debris disk images pointed in the right direction .",

    "<S> debris disks often take the form of eccentric rings with azimuthal asymmetries in surface brightness . </S>",
