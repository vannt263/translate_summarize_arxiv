    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) promises unconditional secure communication through insecure communication channels @xcite . in real world implementations of qkd , however , the achievable secret - key rates are still relatively low compared with standard telecommunication rates .",
    "the rates of secret - key generation are not only constrained by experimental imperfections , which can be amended in principle , but are also limited by the fundamental features of quantum physics . as recently shown in @xcite ,",
    "the entanglement between the two ends of the communication channel ultimately bounds the maximum rate of secret - key generation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an entropic quantity called the squashed entanglement of the channel @xcite , which is function of the quantum communication channel @xmath2 linking the legitimate sender alice to the legitimate receiver bob .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case where the communication channel @xmath2 is a lossy ( and noisy ) bosonic channel .",
    "this means that information is encoded in a collection of bosonic modes whose corresponding canonical operators are denoted @xmath3 , @xmath4 and satisfy the commutation relations @xmath5",
    "= \\delta_{jj'}$ ] . in the heisenberg picture",
    "the quantum channel maps the canonical operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 to @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 $ ] is the attenuation factor ( also called transmissivity ) and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the canonical ladder operators of an environment bosonic mode .",
    "the lossy channel is obtained if the environment mode is initially in the vacuum state , while the lossy and noisy channel corresponds to the environment mode being in a thermal state with @xmath11 mean photon number .",
    "these channels attenuate the input power by a factor @xmath12 and model the ubiquitous processes of linear absorption and scattering of light .",
    "when applied to the case of the lossy bosonic channel , the squashed entanglement bound in ( [ tgw_1 ] ) yields @xcite : @xmath13 where the rate is measured in bits ( throughout this paper @xmath14 ) per bosonic mode ( given the bandwidth of the channel , this can be easily translated in bits per second ) . for both free space and fiber optics communication ,",
    "the attenuation factor @xmath15 scales exponentially with the distance @xmath16 between sender and receiver , where the characteristic length @xmath17 depends on experimental conditions . for long distances , @xmath18 , and",
    "the key rate decays at least exponentially with increasing communication distance .",
    "this result marks a striking difference between quantum - secured communication and ( insecure ) classical communication . in the latter case",
    ", one can in principle achieve a finite communication rate over arbitrarily long distances , just by sufficiently increasing the signal power @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for quantum communication where a fundamental rate - distance tradeoff exists , requiring the use of quantum repeaters to perform qkd on long distances .",
    "it is thus clear that to go around the fundamental rate - distance tradeoff in ( [ tgw_2 ] ) one should renounce unconditionally security . here",
    "we discuss qkd conditioned on the assumption that technological limitations allow an eavesdropper eve to store quantum information reliably only for a known and finite  but otherwise arbitrarily long  time .",
    "such an eavesdropper may also have unlimited computational power , including a quantum computer .",
    "indeed , any physical realization of a quantum memory can reliably store quantum information only for a time of the order of its coherence time .",
    "we stress that we do not require the legitimate receiver to have better quantum storage technologies than the eavesdropper .",
    "as will be shown , the legitimate parties could have a much shorter memory time than the eavesdropper and the communication will still be secure .",
    "according to the state of the art , one requires a quantum cryptography protocol to be unconditionally and composably secure .",
    "unconditional security means that one does not rely on unproven statements ( e.g , about the complexity of factorizing large numbers , or in general about the computational power of the eavesdropper ) .",
    "composable security means that the given protocol is secure also when used as a subroutine within an overarching protocol @xcite .",
    "suppose that a given communication protocol aims at establishing a secret message described as a random variable @xmath19 .",
    "the information about @xmath19 in the hands of the eavesdropper eve is described , without loss of generality , by a bipartite quantum state of the form @xmath20 ideally , one would like eve s state to be completely uncorrelated with the message @xmath19 , that is , @xmath21 @xcite . to quantify",
    "the deviation from such an ideal setting one considers the trace distance @xcite @xmath22 therefore , the security of the communication protocol is assessed by the condition @xmath23 which implies that the state @xmath24 is indistinguishable , up to a probability smaller than @xmath25 , from the state @xmath26 , that is , the given communication protocol is secure up to a probability smaller than @xmath25 @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    "this criterion guarantees unconditional and composable security @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we renounce unconditional security and seek security conditioned on the fact that the eavesdropper can store quantum information only for a finite and known time @xmath27 .",
    "this means that eve is forced to make a measurement within a time @xmath27 after obtaining the quantum state .",
    "suppose that eve has made a measurement @xmath28 described by the povm ( positive operator valued measurement ) elements @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "after the measurement has been made , the state has ` collapsed ' to @xmath30 since @xmath31 is diagonal in the basis @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that is , the trace distance equals the distance between classical probabilities .",
    "finally , optimizing over eve s choice of her measurement , we obtain the following security condition : @xmath37    in this paper , instead of working directly with condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , we require @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the accessible information of eve about @xmath19 given the state @xmath24 @xcite . the latter implies condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , for @xmath40 , via pinsker inequality @xcite @xmath41    it is worth recalling that accessible information was used as a security quantifier during the first years of quantum cryptography , since it was found that a security criterion based on the accessible information does not in general guarantee composable security in an unconditional manner @xcite . here instead we have shown that composability holds under condition ( [ cond1 ] ) if we give up full unconditional security and seek security under the assumption that the eavesdropper can store quantum information only for a finite and known time  i.e , she has a quantum memory with limited storage time .",
    "we present two novel key - generation protocols for continuous - variable quantum optical communication through a lossy bosonic channel with transmissivity @xmath12 , modeling linear attenuation and scattering .",
    "these protocols are composably secure under the condition that eve s as a quantum memory with finite , and known , but otherwise arbitrarily long , storage time .",
    "the first protocol is a direct - reconciliation protocol ( in which we allow information reconciliation by forward public communication from the sender alice to the receiver bob ) .",

    "we henceforth call _ locked key _ a key which is generated by a quantum data locking protocol , just to remind us that this key is not unconditionally secure , but secure conditioned on the assumption of finite memory storage time .",
    "it is known that high rates of secret - key generation can be attained against an eavesdropper endowed with an imperfect quantum memory , as for example in the bounded storage model , where eve can store only a constrained number of qubits ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . even under bounded storage",
    ", no known protocol attains a constant rate as a function of distance .",
    "elsewhere we have shown that quantum data locking allows for a substantial enhancement of the key rate @xcite . here",
    "we show for the first time that such an assumption allows us to generate key at a constant rate across virtually any distance .",
    "it is an open question whether the quantum data locking could be applied in the bounded storage model to attain rates of key generation independent on the distance .",
    "our results must be compared with the bounds on the optimal secret - key rate obtained requiring fully unconditional security . in the asymptotic",
    "setting , the security is usually quantified by the quantum mutual information ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gain in key generation rate that we achieve follows from the existence of a large gap between the quantum mutual information and the accessible information of the adversary .",
    "this gap is well known in quantum information theory : it is the _ quantum discord _",
    "@xcite , which quantifies the quantum correlations that the adversary can not access by local measurements on her share of the quantum system .",
    "in a typical quantum data locking protocol @xcite , the two legitimate parties , say alice and bob , publicly agree on a set of @xmath54 quantum codewords .",
    "they then use a preshared secret key of @xmath55 bits , labeled by @xmath56 , to secretly agree on a set of @xmath57 ( equally probable ) codewords , labeled by @xmath58 , used to encode @xmath59 bits of classical information .",
    "these quantum codewords are sent through @xmath60 uses of a quantum channel from alice to bob .",
    "suppose an eavesdropper eve tampers with the communication line and obtains one of the states @xmath61 .",
    "the correlations between eve s quantum system and the input message @xmath62 are described by the state @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an orthonormal basis for an auxiliary quantum system encoding the messages @xmath62  notice that the summation over @xmath65 comes from the fact that eve does not know the value of the secret key .",
    "one can prove that , if the states @xmath61 have a suitable form and for @xmath66 large enough , eve can only obtain a negligible amount of the classical information  as quantified by the accessible information  carried by the label @xmath62 .",
    "in the most powerful quantum data locking schemes known up to now , a constant - size preshared secret seed of about @xmath67 bits allows alice and bob to encrypt @xmath59 bits ( with @xmath57 arbitrarily large ) , with the guarantee that eve s accessible information is of the order of @xmath68 bits @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that quantum data locking provides a strongest violations of classical information theory in the quantum setting . indeed , according to a famous theorem of shannon s , which assesses the security of one - time pad encryption , to encrypt @xmath69 bits of classical information alice and bob need at least @xmath69 bits of preshared secret key @xcite .",
    "quantum data locking violates this shannon s result by an exponential amount .",
    "a quantum data locking protocol can be seen as a quantum counterpart of the twentieth century enigma machine @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we call ` quantum enigma machine ' an optical cipher that harnesses the quantum data locking effect .",
    "the first works on quantum data locking only considered the ideal case of a noiseless communication scenario .",
    "only recently the quantum data locking effect has been considered in a noisy setting @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we combine quantum data locking with a key - recycling technique that has been successfully applied to quantum data locking in a noisy communication scenario @xcite .",
    "we assume that eavesdropper eve and the legitimate receiver can store quantum information for a time @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "suppose then that alice and bob , using the quantum channel @xmath60 times , run a quantum data locking protocol to communicate @xmath72 bits of classical information , and consume @xmath73 bits of preshared secret key .",
    "bob may need to perform a collective measurement over @xmath60 quantum systems in order to decode .",
    "since , as from our assumption , bob s quantum memory can store quantum information only for times shorter than @xmath71 , this requires that the @xmath60 quantum signals should be sent within this time interval ( this is always possible for @xmath71 large enough or by increasing the repetition rate ) .    on the other hand",
    ", if eve has a quantum memory with finite coherence time @xmath70 , this implies that she is forced to measure within a time @xmath70 after receiving the signals , otherwise her memory will decohere anyway .",
    "therefore , what the legitimate parties alice and bob can do is to wait for a time longer than @xmath70 before sending more information through the channel .",
    "after waiting such a time , alice and bob can safely recycle part of the obtained key as a fresh key to run another round of quantum data locking .",
    "thus , for @xmath74 , alice and bob can recycle part of the newly established key and use it as a seed for another round of quantum data locking . by repeating this procedure many times",
    "they will asymptotically obtain a overall locked - key rate of @xmath75 bits per channel use , with a negligible amount of initially shared secret key .",
    "while @xmath75 is the rate of bits per channel use , one could expect a lower rate in terms of bits per second , due to the waiting times between quantum data locking subroutines .",
    "there is a simple strategy to solve this problem : alice and bob can use the dead times to run two ( or more ) independent quantum data locking protocols . in this way they can in principle achieve a rate of bits per second as high as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number of channel uses per second . notice that this holds for any value of @xmath70 , as long as it is known to alice and bob , and independently of @xmath71 ( for instance we can take @xmath78 or even @xmath79 ) .",
    "alice prepares multimode coherent states that encode both the input message @xmath80 and the value of the secret seeds @xmath81 she shares with bob .",
    "the encoding is by a random code ( whose codebook is public ) that assigns to each pair @xmath82 an @xmath60-mode coherent states @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the amplitude of the coherent state of the @xmath85-th bosonic mode sent through the channel .",
