    "many extensions to the standard model which involve strong dynamics at the electroweak scale include new heavy particles which have been modeled as solitons .",
    "the simplest model within which such particles can be analyzed is the standard electroweak theory with the higgs boson mass @xmath0 taken to infinity and with a skyrme term @xcite added to the higgs sector . with these modifications ,",
    "the higgs sector supports a classically stable soliton whose mass is of order the weak scale , typically a few tev.@xcite    to understand how solitons arise , note that in the absence of the weak gauge interactions , the higgs sector of the standard model is a four - component scalar field theory in which a global @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath2 , with vacuum manifold @xmath3 . in the @xmath4 limit ,",
    "the dynamics is that of an @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model .",
    "field configurations are maps from three dimensional space onto @xmath3 , and the solitons ( skyrmions ) are configurations which carry the associated winding number .",
    "the winding number is topological and soliton number is conserved .",
    "gauging the weak interactions changes the picture qualitatively because the winding number of the higgs field is not invariant under large gauge transformations .",
    "this means that a soliton can either be described as a skyrmion of the higgs field with gauge field @xmath5 or , equivalently , as a topologically trivial higgs field configuration with a suitably chosen nonvanishing @xmath6 .",
    "the latter description makes manifest the fact that there are sequences of gauge and higgs field configurations , beginning with a soliton and ending with a vacuum configuration , such that all configurations in the sequence have finite energy .",
    "this means that the soliton is only metastable : it is separated from the vacuum only by a finite energy barrier and can decay quantum mechanically by tunneling.@xcite or , the soliton can be kicked over the barrier if it is supplied with energy .",
    "the process in which an electroweak soliton is hit with a classical gauge field pulse ( a coherent state of @xmath7-bosons ) and caused to decay has been analyzed numerically.@xcite it is even possible to find a limiting case of the theory in which the quantum mechanical cross - section for a process in which a soliton is struck by a single @xmath7-boson and induced to decay can be calculated analytically.@xcite in any process in which a soliton is destroyed , one net baryon and one net lepton from each standard model generation is anomalously produced.@xcite    electroweak solitons have also been studied in the electroweak theory with finite higgs mass , in which the higgs sector is a linear sigma model.@xcite if a skyrme term is added to the theory , metastable electroweak solitons exist if @xmath0 is sufficiently large . in the linear sigma model ,",
    "the higgs field can vanish at a point in space with only finite cost in energy .",
    "the higgs winding number is therefore not topological even in the absence of gauge interactions .",
    "this means that in a world with gauge interactions and a finite higgs mass , there are two ways for solitons to decay : either via nontrivial gauge field dynamics , as sketched in the previous paragraph , or via the higgs field itself simply unwinding.@xcite    the metastable electroweak soliton is an intriguing object to study . and",
    "yet , it is not found in the standard electroweak theory where the higgs sector is a linear sigma model with no higher derivative terms .",
    "the higgs sector of the standard model is best thought of as an effective field theory describing the low energy ( weak scale ) dynamics of the light degrees of freedom in some higher energy theory .",
    "the simplest examples of higher energy theories which feature particles which can be described as electroweak solitons in the low energy theory are technicolor theories , in which the technibaryons play this role . regardless of whether the underlying theory is specifically a technicolor model",
    ", it will introduce all higher derivative terms allowed by symmetries , including the skyrme term , into the lagrangian of the low energy effective theory . if the higgs boson is discovered to be light ( say , with mass @xmath8 gev )",
    ", the correct low energy effective field theory will almost certainly not support solitons , regardless of the physics of the higher derivative terms .",
    "if the higgs boson is discovered to be heavy , there will be some class of appropriate high energy theories whose low energy effective field theories , although more complicated than that obtained simply by adding a skyrme term to the standard model , feature metastable electroweak solitons . discovery of the corresponding tev scale particles would confirm that nature chooses such a theory .",
    "processes in which two metastable electroweak solitons collide have to date not been studied .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to use the analysis of a two dimensional toy model which shares some ( but not all ) of the features outlined above to motivate the hypothesis that the generic outcome of such collisions may be the destruction of one or both solitons .",
    "this suggests ( but certainly does not demonstrate ) that baryon number violation is the generic outcome of collisions between two of the tev scale particles which can be modeled as solitons .",
    "as a sideline , we note that our numerical methods work equally well for describing soliton ",
    "soliton and soliton  antisoliton collisions .",
    "our focus is on soliton decay in soliton ",
    "soliton collisions ; we note , however , that the numerical simulation of soliton  antisoliton annihilation in the skyrme model is well - known as a difficult numerical problem , plagued with instabilities .",
    "we are able to follow soliton ",
    "antisoliton annihilation without difficulty ( with energy conserved at the part in @xmath9 level ) .",
    "this suggests that our numerical methods  in particular the use of the linear sigma model  may be of broad utility when generalized to 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "let us now introduce the 2 + 1 dimensional model whose metastable solitons we analyze . the lagrangian density , which describes the dynamics of a three component scalar field @xmath10 , is @xmath11\\ . \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath12 is a unit vector which we choose to be @xmath13 .",

    "when @xmath14 , the theory has an @xmath2 symmetry . for @xmath15 ,",
    "one removes the fourth term from ( [ lagrangian ] ) and instead imposes the constraint that @xmath16 at all points in space and time .",
    "because the field @xmath17 is constrained to take values on a two - sphere of radius @xmath18 , field configurations with fixed boundary conditions at infinity can be classified by their winding number @xmath19 which is integer - valued and topological : configurations with different winding number can not be continuously deformed into one another .",
    "this suggests the possibility of soliton solutions to the classical equations of motion .",
    "solitons in 2 + 1dimensional @xmath2 sigma models were first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and their quantum field theoretic properties were analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "such solitons are often called baby skyrmions @xcite because of their similarity to 3 + 1dimensional skyrmions .",
    "although our motivation is the analogy to 3 + 1dimensional electroweak solitons , we note that baby skyrmions themselves do arise in certain 2 + 1dimensional electron systems which exhibit the quantum hall effect @xcite , although the lagrangian used in their description differs from that in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the four - derivative term in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) is the analogue of the skyrme term .",
    "it stabilizes putative solitons against shrinking to arbitrarily small size .",
    "if we were working in three spatial dimensions , the two - derivative term would stabilize putative solitons against growing to arbitrarily large size . in two spatial dimensions , however , the two - derivative term can not play this role because its contribution to the energy of a configuration is scale invariant .",
    "we must therefore introduce a zero - derivative term in order to stabilize solitons against growing without bound .",
    "such a term must explicitly break the @xmath2 symmetry , and therefore has no analogue in 3 + 1dimensional electroweak physics , in which no explicit @xmath1 symmetry breaking terms are allowed .",
    "the particular form of the @xmath20 term in ( [ lagrangian ] ) therefore has no electroweak motivation ; it is analogous to a pion mass term in the 3 + 1 dimensional skyrme model , but this is not relevant to us .",
    "this model ( with @xmath20 nonzero and @xmath21 ) was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its solitons have been analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "similar models , differing only in the choice of the explicit symmetry breaking term in the lagrangian , have also been analyzed.@xcite    the soliton mass and size in the theory with lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) with @xmath22 are given by@xcite @xmath23\\ , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",

    "the parametric dependence of these results can be understood by noting that the energy of a configuration of size @xmath28 receives contributions of order @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 from the first three terms in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) and that , as described above , a soliton is stabilized by the balance between the four - derivative @xmath32 term and the zero - derivative @xmath20 term .",
    "if we stopped here , with @xmath33 infinite , our solitons would be absolutely stable , rather than metastable .",
    "soliton collisions have been simulated in this theory , but of course the solitons never decay.@xcite once @xmath33 is finite , the fields are allowed to deviate from @xmath16 , and the soliton configuration with @xmath16 found previously in the @xmath21 theory may unwind and decay .",
    "indeed , we will see that soliton solutions do not exist for @xmath33 less than some @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 , metastable solitons exist : these solitons are classically stable if left unperturbed , but can be induced to decay if supplied with sufficient energy .",
    "our goal is to determine whether the means by which the energy is delivered is important or whether soliton decay is the result of generic soliton ",
    "soliton collisions , without finely tuned initial conditions .    for our purposes , @xmath33 is the most important parameter in the theory because by choosing its value , we control the energy required to make the soliton decay and indeed control whether solitons exist in the first place .",
    "we are not interested in the dependence on the other parameters , and indeed most of them can be scaled away .",
    "we first set @xmath36 by rescaling @xmath37 .",
    "next , the constant @xmath38 has units of energy and we henceforth measure energy in units such that @xmath39 .",
    "next , @xmath40 has units of length and we henceforth measure length in units such that @xmath41 . note that this means that @xmath42 in our units , but this will not concern us as we only discuss the classical physics of this model .",
    "we have set the speed of light @xmath43 throughout .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are also length scales in the lagrangian , and the theory is therefore fully specified by the two dimensionless parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 . although results do depend on @xmath48 , we are not interested in this dependence , and we choose to follow ref . @xcite and set @xmath49 throughout . once we have chosen units with @xmath50 and have chosen to set @xmath49 , then @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the theory with @xmath22 .    in section 2 , we find metastable soliton configurations for finite values of @xmath33 with @xmath53 .",
    "we shall see that for all values of @xmath33 for which solitons exist , the soliton mass and size change little from their values at @xmath21 . although we do not explore their dependence on @xmath48",
    ", we expect it would be similar to that in ( [ massradius ] ) . in section 3 , we present our results on soliton  soliton collisions .",
    "we find that soliton decay occurs for incident velocities greater than some critical value @xmath54 .",
    "we explore how this critical velocity depends on @xmath33 and on the initial impact parameter and relative orientation of the two solitons .",
    "we find that @xmath54 is less than or of order half the speed of light regardless of the relative orientation as long as @xmath55 and @xmath56 is less than or of order the soliton size .",
    "thus , inducing soliton decay does not require specially chosen initial conditions ; it is a generic outcome of soliton  soliton collisions .",
    "we make concluding remarks in section 4.@xcite    it perhaps goes without saying that our model is at best a crude toy model for the electroweak physics which motivates our analysis .",
    "first , we work in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "second , in order for the theory to have soliton solutions we are forced to include a zero - derivative explicit symmetry breaking term not present in the electroweak theory .",
    "third , we do not introduce a gauge field .",
    "hence , our solitons can only decay via unwinding the scalar field ; in the electroweak theory , gauge field dynamics introduces a second decay mechanism which has no analogue in our theory . related to this ,",
    "our solitons are absolutely stable for @xmath22 , whereas electroweak solitons are metastable even for @xmath57 .",
    "this is perhaps the biggest qualitative difference between our model and electroweak physics .",
    "fourth , one may worry that even if an analysis along the lines of ours were done in the 3 + 1 dimensional electroweak theory itself , the momenta required would make it impossible to analyze soliton decay within the effective theory .",
    "this concern may be evaded for solitons which are almost unstable : in this circumstance , for example , @xmath7-soliton collisions can result in soliton destruction even if the @xmath7-boson momentum is small enough that the calculation is controlled.@xcite soliton  soliton scattering in our model is far from being a complete analogue of the scattering of tev scale particles which can be modeled as metastable electroweak solitons ; we nevertheless hope that our central result , namely that metastable baby skyrmions in 2 + 1 dimensions are destroyed in collisions with generic initial conditions , motivates future work on baryon number violating scattering in this sector .",
    "before we can study soliton  soliton collisions , we must find the metastable soliton configurations for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "we do this by looking for configurations which minimize the static hamiltonian @xmath58 at a given @xmath33 .",
    "the static hamiltonian is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the lagrangian density of ( [ lagrangian ] ) with all terms containing time derivatives set to zero .",
    "we discretize @xmath58 on a square lattice of @xmath61 points , with the spatial separation between points given by @xmath62 ( in our units in which @xmath41 ) .",
    "we discretize the two derivative term in the standard fashion , writing it as a sum over terms like @xmath63 ^ 2\\ .\\ ] ] the skyrme term is trickier to handle , because it involves terms like @xmath64 we discretize this contribution to the hamiltonian as a sum over terms like @xmath65 in this way , we ensure that within each term in the sum over lattice sites , all spatial derivatives are centered at the same point in space .",
    "discretizing the hamiltonian in this fashion ensures that discretization errors are of order @xmath66 .    in order to find a soliton , we begin with a guess ( which we describe momentarily ) for the configuration @xmath67 and perform a numerical minimization of the static hamiltonian using the conjugate gradient method of ref .",
    "( it is important to use a method such as this one , which minimizes a function of @xmath68 variables using computer memory of order @xmath68 rather than of order @xmath69 since we have an @xmath70 dimensional configuration space . ) in order to minimize the energy , the conjugate gradient routine needs expressions for the gradient of the energy at any point in our @xmath68 dimensional configuration space , with respect to each direction in this configuration space .",
    "we obtain these expressions by varying the discretized @xmath58 with respect to the @xmath71 at each lattice site .",
    "( these expressions will of course also appear as the terms with no time derivatives in the dynamical equations of motion of section 3 . )    for @xmath21 , soliton solutions can be written in the form@xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 satisfies the following conditions : @xmath74 ( we define polar coordinates such that the soliton is centered at @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the positive @xmath77-axis , and @xmath78 increases in a clockwise direction . ) note that because of the @xmath20 term in the lagrangian which breaks the @xmath2 symmetry , @xmath79 must point in the @xmath80 direction at large @xmath81 . the @xmath82 symmetry associated with rotations in the @xmath83 plane is not broken in the lagrangian ; in the solution , these rotations are mapped onto rotation in the @xmath84 plane about the soliton center .",
    "this configuration is thus a two - dimensional analogue of what in three dimensions is called a hedgehog configuration .    in our search for solitons at finite @xmath33",
    ", we therefore begin by choosing a reasonably large @xmath33 , namely @xmath85 , and making an initial guess of the form ( [ guess ] ) with @xmath86 .",
    "we then run the conjugate gradient relaxation algorithm repeatedly , until the change in the energy between successive relaxation steps is smaller than one part in @xmath87 . of the soliton energy .",
    "this confirms that the relaxation algorithm has indeed converged to a static solution to the full equations of motion . ]",
    "the soliton configuration we find is a hedgehog configuration , as at @xmath21 .",
    "however , when @xmath33 is finite , @xmath88 . the soliton we find can be written in the form @xmath89 with @xmath73 satisfying the same boundary conditions as above . and",
    "@xmath73 , discretized that hamiltonian in @xmath81 , and then used a conjugate gradient algorithm to find these two functions of @xmath81 .",
    "this would have been less computationally intensive than finding @xmath90 as we did .",
    "however , the expressions we obtain by varying our static hamiltonian relative to the fields @xmath71 at each lattice site , and indeed the results we obtain for @xmath71 at each lattice site in a soliton configuration , are precisely what we need in the next section when we analyze soliton  soliton collisions , which are of course not circularly symmetric and so can not be written in terms of @xmath91 and @xmath73 . ]",
    "we depict the soliton configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : solitonprofiles ] .",
    "cc & +    after obtaining a baby skyrmion at @xmath85 , we used the resulting configuration as the initial condition for relaxation at @xmath92 , and so found the soliton configuration at this @xmath33 .",
    "we repeated this process step - by - step in @xmath33 , finding solitons for values of @xmath33 down to @xmath93 . at @xmath94 ,",
    "energy minimization led to a configuration with zero energy , instead of to a soliton .",
    "we then used the @xmath93 soliton as an initial configuration for relaxation at @xmath95 , and so on down to @xmath96 where again no soliton was found .",
    "we therefore know that a stable soliton exists at @xmath97 .",
    "it is a logical possibility that there is a stable soliton at @xmath96 even though our relaxation algorithm did not find one .",
    "we think this is unlikely , because the soliton configurations which we have found at @xmath97 and @xmath98 are very similar , and we therefore believe that the @xmath97 soliton is a very good starting configuration from which to find the @xmath96 soliton if it existed .",

    "we choose an initial relative orientation angle @xmath102 , meaning that one soliton is obtained from the other by translation without rotation .",
    "previous work shows that two static solitons with this relative orientation repel each other.@xcite this is consistent with what we find : for low velocities , as for example for @xmath101 , the two solitons bounce off each other and return whence they came .",

    "this time , the outcome , depicted in fig .",

    "we now consider collisions between solitons with a relative orientation angle @xmath129 , still with @xmath100 and @xmath110 .",
    "for this relative orientation , there is no force between static solitons.@xcite we find the same possible outcomes as we did for @xmath122 . as a function of increasing velocity , the outcome of a collision is either capture to form the ring - shaped bound state , or soliton destruction .",
    "( again , scattering by an angle of @xmath124 followed by the escape of two intact solitons would be a possibility at larger @xmath33 . )",
    "the critical velocity above which soliton decay occurs is @xmath130 .",
    "we have analyzed soliton ",
    "soliton collisions in a @xmath131-dimensional theory with metastable baby skyrmion solutions .",
    "we find classically stable soliton solutions for values of the parameter @xmath33 which are larger than @xmath132 .",
    "these solitons are prevented from decaying by a finite energy barrier and so can decay if supplied with sufficient energy , for example in a collision with a second soliton .",
    "we have mapped out the space of initial conditions under which the outcome of a soliton  soliton collision is the destruction of one or both solitons .",
    "we find that soliton decay results whenever two solitons collide with an incident velocity greater than some @xmath54 .",
    "this critical velocity depends on the parameters in the problem .",
    "it goes to zero as @xmath133 and the solitons cease to be classically stable .",
    "it goes to the speed of light as @xmath21 and the barrier to decay becomes infinite .",
    "however , @xmath54 does not rise particularly rapidly with @xmath33 : with other parameters chosen as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamvel ] , @xmath54 is only half the speed of light for @xmath134 .",
    "thus , soliton destruction does _ not _ require that the theory have a value of @xmath33 lying in some narrow range just above @xmath34 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath56 need not be finely tuned either .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath54 is lowest for collisions with @xmath110 .",
    "however , @xmath54 increases by less than a factor of two for @xmath56 of order the soliton radius .",
    "@xmath54 also depends on the relative orientation angle @xmath135 between the two solitons in the initial state . here too , the dependence is weak . in the example we explored in detail",
    ", we found that as @xmath135 changes from @xmath136 to @xmath123 , @xmath54 varies between @xmath130 and @xmath126 .",
    "thus , although @xmath54 does depend on @xmath33 and on the parameters other than the velocity needed to fully specify a choice of initial conditions , the variation of @xmath54 is not dramatic .",
    "soliton decay is not restricted to specially chosen velocities , impact parameters , orientations , or values of @xmath33 .",
    "soliton decay is a generic outcome of soliton  soliton collisions .",
    "our findings motivate future investigation of collisions between metastable solitons in the @xmath137-dimensional electroweak theory .",
    "previous work on two - particle collisions involving these electroweak solitons has focussed on collisions between a @xmath7 boson and a soliton @xcite . in such collisions ,",
    "the probability for soliton decay falls exponentially as the ( rough ) analogue of @xmath33 is increased above the ( rough ) analogue of @xmath34 .",
    "this was traced to two facts : first , causing one of these solitons to decay requires delivering sufficient energy to one particular mode of oscillation of the soliton .",
    "second , a generic incident @xmath7-boson couples very weakly to the mode which must be energized if decay is to be induced .",
    "we find no analogue of this difficulty in our analysis of soliton  soliton collisions in @xmath131 dimensions .",
    "if there is a particular mode which must be excited , then soliton  soliton collisions seem to generically deliver energy to this mode . and",
    ", we certainly see no evidence of soliton decay being restricted to theories with @xmath138 .",
    "this suggests that collisions between two tev scale particles which can be modeled as electroweak solitons ( rather than between one @xmath7-boson and one such particle ) may be an arena in which two - particle collisions generically lead to baryon number violation . as we stressed in the introduction , however ,",
    "the metastable baby skyrmions we analyze differ in several important qualitative respects from metastable electroweak solitons . furthermore , our analysis has been purely classical whereas the analysis of @xmath7-soliton collisions in ref .",
    "@xcite is quantum mechanical .",
    "although our results motivate an analysis of collisions between electroweak solitons , they should not be taken to provide even qualitative guidance as to the outcome of such a study .",
