    "an important unanswered question in modern astrophysics concerns the mechanism(s ) by which stars and star clusters form . this is especially true in the case of massive stars , which are challenging objects to observe",
    "since they are rare , evolve on short timescales , and are often highly extincted .",
    "various theories have been proposed concerning the formation process of massive stars , like monolithic collapse of molecular cloud cores ( mckee & tan 2003 ) , competitive gas accretion in small clusters ( larson 1978 , bonnell et al .",
    "1997 ) driven by turbulent fragmentation ( klessen & burkert 2000 , klessen , heitsch & mac low 2000 , klessen 2001 ) and stellar collisions and mergers in dense clusters ( bonnell et al .",
    "1998 , clarke & bonnell 2008 ) .",
    "for further discussions , see mac  low & klessen ( 2004 ) , mckee & ostriker ( 2007 ) , and zinnecker & yorke ( 2007 ) .",
    "calculations of the collapse of protostellar clouds show that the collapse proceeds non - homologously and in such a way that the central regions rapidly form a proto - stellar core while the outer regions still continue to fall inward ( bodenheimer & sweigart 1968 , larson , 1969 , shu 1977 ) .",
    "the formation of low and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath3 m@xmath2 ) can readily be explained this way ( palla & stahler 1993 ) , however this models fails for high - mass stars since for stars more massive than about 20 m@xmath2 the kelvin - helmholtz timescale is larger than their formation time , meaning that these stars start core hydrogen burning while they are still accreting .",
    "once the resulting radiation pressure from the stellar core exceeds the gravitational attraction , further accretion of gas is halted , limiting stellar masses to 20 m@xmath2 at least for spherically symmetric accretion ( kahn 1974 , wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) .",
    "the effects of non - ionizing as well ionizing radiation , however , might be overcome if accretion happens through an accretion disc which shields the gas from radiation ( yorke & sonnhalter 2002 , krumholz et al .",
    "2009 , peters et al . 2010a , b , c ) .",
    "based on the fact that massive stars are mainly found in the central regions of rich star clusters ( hillenbrand 1997 , hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) , bonnell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented a model for high - mass star formation in which high - mass stars form through gas accretion and repeated mergers in the center of a star cluster . in their calculations , the clusters contracted while stars were accreting until the central density became high enough for stellar collisions to occur",
    "once a massive star has formed , the remaining cluster gas is removed and the cluster expands again .",
    "clarke & bonnell ( 2008 ) found furthermore that relaxation effects between proto - stars prevent low - mass clusters from reaching high - enough densities needed for collisions , in good agreement with the fact that high - mass stars are only found in massive clusters @xcite .",
    "direct simulations of the role of stellar collisions for star formation are still lacking . in the present paper we present @xmath0-body simulations of the early evolution of proto - clusters .",
    "our clusters start as a mix of gas and proto - stars and we follow the cluster evolution through the accretion and gas expulsion phases . our paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : mod ] we describe the details of our simulations . in   [ sec : results ] we present our results and in   [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "all simulations were made with the graphics - card enabled version of the collisional @xmath0-body code nbody6 @xcite on nvidia graphic processing units ( gpu ) .",
    "nbody6 uses a hermite scheme to integrate the motion of stars , and uses an ahmad - cohen type neighbor scheme @xcite for the calculation of forces from the nearest neighbors .",
    "it also uses ks @xcite and chain regularisation @xcite to deal with close encounters between stars .    in our simulations ,",
    "the star clusters were assumed to be initially a mix of gas and accreting proto - stars .",
    "the gas was not simulated directly , instead its influence on the stars was modeled as a modification to the equation of motion of stars .",
    "we assumed that the star formation efficiency does not depend on the position inside the cluster , so gas and stars followed the same density distribution initially , which was given by a plummer model .",
    "the influence of the external gas was calculated at each regular time step of nbody6 . since nbody6 uses a hermite scheme to integrate the motion of stars , the correction terms due to the external gas on the acceleration and its first derivative",
    "were evaluated at each regular step .",
    "more details on the way the external gas was implemented can be found in @xcite .",
    "the overall star formation efficiency was set to be 30% , i.e. 70% of the initial gas was not converted into stars , which agrees with typical star formation efficiencies found for embedded clusters in the milky way @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the removal of gas not converted into stars sets in after @xmath4 myr or , if the formation timescale is longer , after the most massive stars have formed .",
    "after this time , the fraction of gas was assumed to decrease exponentially on a timescale of @xmath5 myr , i.e. @xmath6 the timescale for @xmath7 was chosen such that our clusters are gas free after a few myr , in agreement with observations which show that most embedded star clusters have ages of less than a few myr ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "all simulations were run for 10 myr to allow a comparison of our simulations with observations of gas embedded star clusters and young open clusters .",
    "all proto - stars started with a mass of @xmath8 m@xmath2 initially .",
    "we assumed that all stars accrete with the same accretion rate .",
    "most simulations were done with an accretion rate of @xmath9 m@xmath2/yr , but we also made simulations with accretion rates of @xmath10 m@xmath2/yr and @xmath11 m@xmath2/yr to test the influence of the assumed accretion rate on our results .",
    "it is possible that the accretion rate onto massive stars is higher than onto low - mass stars , as e.g. indicated by infall motions and other accretion tracers ( e.g. fuller et al .",
    "2005 , keto & wood 2006 ) .",
    "our simulations should therefore be regarded as first steps to address the question of stellar collisions during star formation . due to the constant accretion rate for all stars ,",
    "low - mass stars reach their final mass first , in agreement with observations of young open clusters in the milky way , which show that high mass stars are still accreting after low - mass stars have completed their accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass of the gas was reduced in the same way as the stars gained mass such that the total cluster mass was constant before the onset of gas removal .",
    "accretion onto the protostars was stopped once the mass of each star reached a pre - specified final mass .",
    "the mass function of these final masses was given by a kroupa imf @xcite between lower and upper mass limits of @xmath12 m@xmath2 and @xmath13 m@xmath2 .",
    "due to the low upper mass limit in our runs , any star with mass @xmath14 m@xmath2 can not form directly but has to form via collisions between lower - mass stars .",
    "the radius evolution of the stars in our simulations was split into three different phases , the accretion phase , the cooling phase and the stellar evolution phase after stars have reached the main sequence .    during the accretion phase proto - stars grow in mass until they have reached their final mass .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that in the accretion phase proto - stellar radii depend on the actual mass of a star and its accretion rate , but not on the final mass . in our simulations ,",
    "the radius of a star in the accretion phase is given by : @xmath15    in the contraction phase stars contract towards the zero - age main sequence after having reached their final mass . during the contraction phase",
    ", we assume that the radius of a star depends on its mass and the time which has passed since the star has reached its final mass . to roughly match the results of the detailed calculations by @xcite , we assumed that for stars more massive than 7 m@xmath2 , the stellar radius decreases exponentially towards the zero - age main sequence such that : @xmath16 here @xmath17 are the zero - age main - sequence radii of stars which we have taken from @xcite , assuming solar metallicity .",
    "@xmath18 is the maximum radius reached during the accretion phase according to eq .",
    "[ radacc ] , @xmath19 is the time when this radius is reached , and @xmath20 is the cooling timescale which is given by @xmath21 after 5 @xmath20 , we assumed that stars start their main sequence evolution , which was modeled according to the fitting formulae of @xcite . for stars less massive than 7 m@xmath2 ,",
    "the bernasconi & maeder ( 1996 ) tracks differ significantly from an exponential decrease , so we assumed a linear decrease of the stellar radius with time according to @xmath22 for times @xmath23 , where the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 were given by @xmath26 for times @xmath27 , we assumed @xmath28 , while for times @xmath29 stars were assumed to undergo standard stellar evolution .",
    "[ fig : radev ] shows the time evolution of stellar radii for two different masses according to @xcite and our simple fitting formulae .",
    "we adjusted the accretion rate such that our models start at the same initial radius as the models of bernasconi & maeder ( 1996 ) .",
    "our fitting formulae are within 20% of the bernasconi & maeder models for most times , which should be sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",

    "the high mass stars therefore form in the cluster center and do not have to spiral into the center by dynamical friction . furthermore ,",
    "the cluster core contracts during the accretion process due to mass increase , further facilitating stellar collisions . table  1 and fig .",
    "[ fig : collmseg ] show the number of collisions in the segregated models .",
    "it can be seen that the number of collisions which occur in the runs are now about a factor 10 higher than in the unsegregated models . in particular in the most concentrated models starting with @xmath30 pc ,",
    "the number of collisions is now sufficiently high to build up a main - sequence of high - mass stars . a closer look at the data also shows that in the mass segregated models the collisions happen at earlier times on average , for the star cluster with @xmath31 and @xmath30 pc cluster , for example , roughly half of all collisions happen in the pre - ms stage .",
    "we note that these results are not in contradiction to results obtained by @xcite , who found that primordial mass segregation does not lead to a significant increase in the number of stellar collisions , since in our simulations the increase in the number of collisions comes to a large part from an increase in the central density as a result of the mass accretion of the heavy stars .",
    "in contrast , ardi et al . started their simulations with all stars being on the main sequence and the same mass density for segregated and unsegregated clusters , meaning that the stellar number density in the mass segregated clusters was much lower than in the unsegregated models .",
    "for the segregated clusters .",
    "compared to the unsegregated case , the number of stellar collisions is increased by about a factor 10 . in clusters with initial densities",

    "all models have significantly smaller half - light light radii than the non - segregated models of the previous section .",
    "the final half - light radii are also significantly smaller than in the previous section , despite some expansion due to gas expulsion , stellar evolution , and dynamical heating by binary stars .",
    "the projected half - light radii of bright stars are for all models also well below the measured radii of young open clusters .",
    "it therefore is unlikely that any of the mass segregated models represents the starting condition of any observed milky way cluster . starting with even larger",
    "cluster radii would be a way to get a better fit to observed cluster radii , however this would again reduce the number of collisions to too small levels .",
    "strong cluster expansion on a timescale of a few @xmath34 yrs after the most massive stars have formed would be needed to bring the cluster radii into agreement with observed cluster radii .",
    "this may be achieved through a very small star formation efficiency of the order of 10% or less , which however is much smaller than observed star formation efficiencies ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "it therefore seems that primordial mass segregation and a shrinking cluster core are not a way to get a sufficiently high number of collisions for realistic clusters .",
    "yr due to mass accretion of massive stars , which decreases the size of the cluster core .",
    "later radii increase due to dynamical evolution and stellar evolution mass loss .",
    "the projected half - light radii stay significantly below the observed radii of young star clusters .",
    "if star clusters form mass segregated , the starting radii must be larger than several pc in order to fit observed cluster radii after a few myr.,width=321 ]    an additional problem for the hypothesis that high - mass stars form by stellar collisions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfuncmseg ] .",
    "it shows the final mass function of stars in the four mass segregated models which have the largest number of collisions .",
    "all models show a sharp drop in the number of stars at @xmath35 m@xmath2 , meaning that collisions were not able to build a sufficient number of stars with @xmath14 m@xmath2 . instead , the main effect of collisions was the formation of a single massive star in each cluster , inspection of the runs shows that typically more than 90% of all collisions involve the same star .",
    "this behavior is similar to what @xcite found for collisions between main - sequence stars in dense star clusters : the most massive star has a large radius and also attracts other stars via gravitational focusing . as a result it has by far the highest cross section for collisions of all stars in the core and",
    "once it has grown beyond a certain critical mass , all further collisions happen nearly exclusively with this star . instead of building many massive stars in the mass range 15 m@xmath36 100 m@xmath2",
    ", there is runaway growth of a single star only .",
    "this star can reach masses with more than 100 m@xmath2 in some of our runs . although these runs are probably too concentrated to lead to realistic star clusters , runaway collisions might be possible in more massive star clusters with larger radii .",
    "collisions will also be more common if stars more massive than the mass limit of 15 m@xmath2 chosen here can form directly through gas accretion since higher mass stars have larger cross sections . runaway collisions between massive stars during the pre - ms phase could therefore lead to the formation of very massive stars in the densest star clusters , like the massive wn5 - 6 stars with masses up to 320 m@xmath2 recently found in several massive star clusters by @xcite .",
    "they might also contribute to the formation of intermediate - mass black holes in dense star clusters @xcite .",

    "stellar collisions do not lead to the build - up of such a mass function , instead they mainly lead to the formation of single , very massive stars .",
    "the behavior is similar to the runaway merging scenario found for main - sequence stars in dense star clusters.,width=321 ]      fig .",
    "[ fig : macc ] depicts the influence of the mass accretion rate on the number of collisions occurring in a cluster within the first 10 myr .",
    "all clusters start from a half - mass radius of @xmath37 pc and are unsegregated . according to eq .  2 , stars accreting with a larger rate are more extended , which will lead to a higher number of collisions .",
    "however , larger accretion rates also lead to shorter pre - main sequence times which decreases the number of collisions .",
    "[ fig : macc ] shows that both effects nearly cancel each other the accretion rate changes only by a factor of two despite the fact that the accretion rate varies between @xmath38 m@xmath2/yr to @xmath39 m@xmath2/yr .",
    "this is too small to significantly change the results of the previous paragraphs .",
    "the number of collisions changes by less than a factor of three between the different runs since e.g. for high accretion rates , the larger radii of stars in the pre - main sequence phase are compensated for by the smaller time spend in the pre - main sequence phase.,width=321 ]    another possible effect which was not considered so far is the influence of binary stars .",
    "it is well known that most massive stars reside in binary or multiple systems ( garca & mermilliod 2001 , lada 2006 , sana et al .",
    "stellar binaries have a larger cross section for collisions than single stars , which could enhance the number of collisions .",
    "we therefore performed a number of simulations containing primordial binaries .",
    "we assumed an initial binary fraction of 50% in these runs and that all high - mass stars reside in binaries .",
    "binary masses were chosen such that stars were ordered according to their mass and the components of each binary were drawn from consecutive stars in this list , i.e. the first binary contained the two most massive stars .",
    "hence , the stellar binary fraction is 100% for the high - mass stars , while all low mass stars are single .",
    "although being a strong simplification , our adopted binary distribution reflects the drop in binary fraction towards late spectral types seen for stars in the galactic disc ( lada 2006 ) .",
    "the semi - major axis of the binaries were chosen randomly in @xmath40 between a minimum radius three times as large as the sum of the radii reached at the end of the accretion phase and a maximum radius which was set equal to 100 au .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed in our runs that the semi - major axis of each binary remains constant during the accretion phase and increased the stellar velocities of the components to avoid a shrinkage of the binary .",
    "[ fig : bin ] shows the resulting number of collisions in runs with binary stars .",
    "the number of collisions is large in very compact clusters with @xmath41 pc .",
    "the projected half - light radii of these clusters after 10 myrs are similar to those of clusters without binaries and still smaller than about 0.3 pc ( see table  1 ) .",
    "such clusters therefore still end up too compact compared to observed open clusters . in more extended clusters",
    "the number of collisions is still not high enough to allow the build - up of a complete main sequence of massive stars .",
    "it is therefore likely that even in the presence of binaries , stellar collisions do not play a significant role for the formation of massive stars .",
    "a definite answer to this question can , however , only be made if a wider range of binary distributions is explored .",
    "pc , this is still not large enough to create a sufficient number of high - mass stars.,width=321 ]",
    "we have performed @xmath0-body simulations of the pre - main sequence evolution of stars in stellar clusters , taking account gas accretion , primordial gas expulsion , and collisions between stars .",
    "our simulations show that it is very unlikely that all high - mass stars with masses @xmath42 m@xmath2 form from the collisions of lower mass stars .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : first , the necessary number of collisions between massive stars only occurs for central densities around @xmath43 m@xmath2/pc@xmath33 , implying initial half - mass radii @xmath44 pc for clusters of a few thousand stars .",
    "such clusters remain highly concentrated within the first 10 myr of their evolution , despite expansion due to gas expulsion and stellar evolution mass loss , and therefore lead to clusters which are significantly more concentrated than known open clusters with o and b type stars which generally have radii around 1 pc .",
    "our simulations show that the observed radii of young open clusters imply initial radii in the range 0.2 to 1 pc for most of them .",
    "second , even if a sufficient number of collisions occurs , this will normally lead to the formation of single runaway stars with extremely large masses instead of the build - up of the observed high - mass imf , a result that was recently also obtained by @xcite through direct @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the reason is the large cross section for collisions and gravitational focusing of massive stars .",
    "the number of collisions can not be increased sufficiently by considering different mass accretion rates or binary stars .",
    "it therefore appears unlikely that massive stars form by collisions .",
    "instead , mass growth by accretion through an accretion disc seems the more likely explanation for the formation of massive stars .",
    "the question arises if other initial conditions not studied in this paper , like dynamically cool models or clumpy stellar distributions could change the number of collisions sufficiently .",
    "dynamically cool models are unlikely to lead to dramatically higher collision rates .",
    "although the central density may increase considerably during the initial contraction phase , this time period is very short as the cluster will virialise within a few crossing times and then evolve along the same tracks as the models considered here .",
    "since our simulations typically last for 10s to 1000s of crossing times , an initial collapse phase lasting a few crossing times would not significantly change the outcome of our simulations .",
    "we suspect the same to be true for clumpy initial conditions .",
    "again any potential contraction phase would be short compared to the overall evolutionary timespan considered , and in addition clumps that are very small or very compact will quickly dissolve by three body encounters .",
    "however , a more definite answer will require a detailed parameter study of the dynamical evolution of initially non - relaxed dense clusters .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this first assessment of the problem .    in clusters more massive than the ones studied here , or in clusters containing more massive stars",
    ", collisions between pre - main sequence stars might become important .",
    "it is attractive to speculate that they might lead to the formation of a few extremely massive stars , like the pistol star in the quintuplet star cluster @xcite , or the massive wn5 - 6 stars recently found in several massive clusters by @xcite , and therefore ultimately to the formation of intermediate - mass black holes with masses up to a few hundred m@xmath2 .",
