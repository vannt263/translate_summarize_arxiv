    "scattering of waves from a group of scatterers is rich in interesting physical phenomena .",
    "examples are electrons or phonons scattering from defects or impurities in crystals and light scattering from conjugated molecules or biological complexes .",
    "multiple scattering effects are nontrivial , especially when scatterers are placed close , i.e. , inside each other s effective radius @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total cross section of a single scatterer .",
    "if the scatterers are resonant , their effective radius can be much larger than their physical size or force range .",
    "a classical example is the case of weak , fixed frequency sound incident on two proximate , small identical air bubbles in water  @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , for two scatterers placed together well within the resonant wave length of scattered particle , extremely narrow proximity resonance can appear  @xcite .",
    "three or more proximate scatterers lead to related effects .    in this paper",
    "we have formulated a novel general method , eigenmode expasion , for quantum scattering of a system of @xmath1-wave point scatterers of any number and geometric configuration .",
    "the eigenmode expansion is based on green function and is equivalent to solving lippmann - schwinger equation exactly  taking all orders of multiple scattering into account .",
    "it is obvious from eigenmode expansion approach that the @xmath2  matrix of such a system is of rank  @xmath0 and we are able to construct the @xmath2  matrix explicitly .",
    "many features of the spectrum ( total scattering cross section as a function of energy ) of identical proximate scatterers can be explained simply by this approach .",
    "for example , we can naturally explain the position , width , and superradiant or subradiant nature of resonance peaks , and the unsymmetric fano lineshape of sharp proximity resonance peaks based on the high energy tail of a broad band .",
    "we are also surprised to find off - resonant eigenmodes of _ randomly distributed _ identical proximate scatterers exhibit great symmetry and regularity .",
    "similar systems of @xmath0 interacting resonances have been previously studied , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "though our eigenmode expansion approach is of course equivalent to standard scattering theory , it gives new physical insights , as we demonstrate below .",
    "in addition , the quantum scattering of @xmath0 proximate @xmath1-wave scatterers is related to the superradiance problem  @xcite .",
    "again , our eigenmode expansion gives new insights to superradiance .",
    "we start by introducing our model for @xmath1-wave point scatterers . consider a single elastic scatterer placed at @xmath6 , the asymptotic form of the total wave function is : @xmath7 the first term on the rhs is the incoming plane wave , and the second term is the scattered wave .",
    "the angular dependent scattering amplitude @xmath8 satisfies the optical theorem : @xmath9 where the total cross section @xmath10 the @xmath2  matrix of the scatterer in the subspace of energy shell @xmath11 , @xmath12 , can be defined as an operator acting on functions of @xmath13 : @xmath14 we assume the force range of the scatterer is small compared to the wavelength of the scattered particle , so it only scatters the @xmath1-wave component ( @xmath15 ) of the incoming wave .",
    "the now angular independent scattering amplitude is related to the phase angle @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath2 matrix is of rank 1 .",
    "@xmath12 has only one non-0 eigenvalue @xmath18 , whose corresponding eigenvector is the 0th order sperical harmonic .",
    "a simple scatterer with one internal breit - wigner type resonance can be modeled as : @xmath19 the total cross section has a lorentzian shape ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "resonance corresponds to the pole of @xmath23 on complex @xmath24 plane , at @xmath25 , where the `` scattered wave '' can exist without the incoming wave . physically @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to position and half width of the resonance peak .",
    "we further assume the force range of the scatterer is so small that it can be considered as existing only at one point .",
    "in this point scatterer model , eq .",
    "( [ fundamental ] ) holds not only asymtotically , but over all space .",
    "since any incoming wave @xmath28 of energy @xmath21 can be written as a superposition of plane waves with @xmath11 , the total wave function can be written as : @xmath29 where the free space green function @xmath30 .",
    "the only significant difference is the extra factor @xmath31 , the amplitude of the incoming wave at the point scatterer .",
    "we are now ready to tackle the multiple - scatterer problem  @xcite .",
    "the total wave function for a system of @xmath0 scatterers fixed at positions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scattering amplitude of the @xmath38-th scatterer , @xmath39 is the free space green function from @xmath40 : @xmath41 and for simplicity we have omitted all implicit @xmath42 ( energy ) dependence .",

    "we can express them explicitly in matrix form .",

    "( [ l_s ] ) is clear .",
    "formally @xmath59 each term @xmath60 @xmath61 means the incoming wave is scattered @xmath62 times , since @xmath54 means scattering once by one scatterer , and @xmath52 means free propagation from one scatterer to another . an integral equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ l_s ] ) is known in general scattering theory as the lippmann - schwinger equation  @xcite .",
    "resonances occur at poles of @xmath63 on complex @xmath24 plane .    the scattered wave @xmath64 depends only on @xmath46 , the amplitudes of the incoming wave at scatterers .",
    "asymptotically @xmath65 if the incoming wave is a plane wave @xmath66 , the sum in parenthesis of eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) is nothing else but the scattering amplitude @xmath67 .",
    "for a single scatterer , for incoming wave @xmath15 ( @xmath68 ) , the scattered wave is proportional to @xmath69the outward part of the incoming wave  with a phase factor .",
    "is there any incoming wave for multiple scatterers such that the scattered wave is proportional to the outward part of the incoming wave with a phase factor ?",
    "this is equivalent to looking for eigenvectors of the @xmath2  matrix of the whole system . in the spherically symmetric case ,",
    "diagonalization of @xmath2  matrix is essentially spherical harmonic partial wave expansion .",
    "some textbooks have discussed the formal diagonalization of the @xmath2  ( or @xmath70 )  matrix for a general system , and its application to scattering of particles with spin and scattering reactions .",
    "we have found , as will be shown immediately , that for a system of @xmath1-wave point scatterers of any number and geometric configuration , the @xmath2  matrix can be analytically represented under some special basis , and can be diagonalized easily .    from eq .",
    "( [ nbasic ] ) , we see the scattered wave of multiple scatterers is a superposition of @xmath39 s , so we try to write the incoming wave as a superposition of @xmath71 s : @xmath72 or @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and the @xmath75 spherical bessel matrix @xmath76 is defined as : @xmath77 we have @xmath78 , and from eq .",

    "the angular dependence of the incoming and scattered wave is @xmath86 each @xmath82 or @xmath87 can be regarded as an _ eigenmode _ or eigenchannel of the system .",
    "@xmath88 is the relative amplitude of the scattered wave from the @xmath38-th scatterer .",
    "eigenvalue @xmath89 is related to the phase angle of the @xmath90-th eigenmode @xmath91 by @xmath92    eigenmodes have some basic properties that can be proved straight forwardly .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath82 can always be chosen real due to time reversal symmetry : @xmath93 ( 2 ) the eigenmodes obey orthonormal relations upon normalization : @xmath94 ( 3 ) @xmath89 s and @xmath87 s are actually eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the @xmath2  matrix : @xmath95 it is clear now that @xmath87 s here play the same role as spherical harmonics in spherically symmetric case .",
    "spherical harmonics are eigenchannels under special conditions , namely , when the system is spherically symmetric .",
    "any incoming wave can be written as : @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is orthogonal to each @xmath98 .",
    "immediately we see the @xmath97 part does not scatter at all , because each scatterer only scatters @xmath1-wave and @xmath97 is orthogonal to each @xmath98 . for a single scatterer , the @xmath2",
    "matrix is of rank @xmath99 . for a system of @xmath0 scatterers , the @xmath2",
    "matrix is of rank  @xmath0 , since the system only scatters incoming waves belonging to the @xmath0-dimensional function space the sum in eq .",
    "( [ x5 ] ) spans .",
    "there is a simpler explanation for the rank of the @xmath2  matrix .",
    "recall from section  [ sec2 ] that the scattered wave @xmath64 depends only on @xmath46 , amplitudes of the incoming wave at scatterers .",
    "for all the infinitely degenerate incoming waves of energy @xmath21 , we can have a basis in which all but @xmath0 waves have @xmath3  amplitude at all @xmath40 s .",
    "consequently , the system only scatters the @xmath0 waves which have non-@xmath3 amplitudes at @xmath40 s , and does not scatter the rest at all .    in eigenmodes @xmath87 ( plus all other linearly independent functions of @xmath13 orthogonal to all @xmath87 s ) basis , the @xmath2  matrix has a diagonal form : @xmath100 the eigenmodes are actually eigenvectors corresponding to non-@xmath3 eigenvalues of the @xmath2  matrix .",
    "in fact , matrix @xmath80 is representation of @xmath2  matrix in the ( nonorthogonal ) @xmath101 basis ( or @xmath102 is representation of @xmath2  matrix in the @xmath103 basis ) .",
    "this can be verified if you view eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) as transformation of basis .",
    "we can use eigenmode expansion to calculate the total cross section for an incoming plane wave .",
    "optical theorem can also be verified .",
    "the total scattering cross section not only depends on the energy ( or @xmath42 ) , but also the direction @xmath104 of the incoming wave .",
    "this is what we would expect for a system without spherical symmetry .",
    "the average of total cross section over all possible incoming directions for a given energy is independent of @xmath104 .",
    "from now on , we will use `` total cross section '' in this sense .",
    "the total cross section @xmath105 is a sum of contributions from each eigenmode  .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "numerical evidence shows that for scatterers with the properties of eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) , each phase angle @xmath91 monotonically increases from @xmath3 to @xmath106 as the energy goes from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "therefore each eigenmode will contribute a resonance peak to total cross section ( if the peaks do not overlap ) .",
    "the position of the peak is at where @xmath109 , and the width is determined by how fast @xmath91 passes through @xmath110 and nearby region as a function of energy . for a system of @xmath0 scatterers , there will be @xmath0 resonance peaks in total cross section , whose positions and widths are consistent with the @xmath0 poles of @xmath63 on complex @xmath24 plane .",
    "first we consider the simplest case of multiple scattering : two identical scatterers separated by distance @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath54 , @xmath112 , and @xmath76 all have the form of @xmath113 , so does @xmath114 .",
    "thus without knowing @xmath115 explicitly , we can immediately say the two ( unnormalized ) eigenmodes are : @xmath116 corresponding to the two scatterers oscillating perfectly in and out of phase with the same strength .",
    "( [ 2modes ] ) is valid at any energy .",

    "compared to the two scatterer case , the difference is that the relative amplitudes in each @xmath82 are now energy dependent . nonetheless , upon reflection about @xmath126 plane , there are always two symmetric modes @xmath118 , @xmath127 , and one antisymmetric mode @xmath120 . fig .
