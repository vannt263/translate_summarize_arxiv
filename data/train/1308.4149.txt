    "in the last few years , comprehensive surveys of the milky way galaxy have been performed at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths that have imaged dust continuum emission and have provided the most complete census of embedded sites of star formation in our galaxy . the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps )",
    "version 1.0 mapped over 170 square degrees of the galactic plane at 1.1 mm ( aguirre et al .",
    "2011 ) and has catalogued over 8400 continuum sources ( rosolowsky et al .",
    "the bgps observed the entire first quadrant in a strip that is 1wide in galactic latitude with selected regions observed in the second ( @xmath10 98 , 111 , 133@xmath11 136 ) , third ( 188@xmath12 192 ) and fourth quadrants ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a complementary survey at 870 @xmath14 m , atlasgal , has mapped sections of the southern milky way with a 2wide strip in galactic latitude between longitudes of @xmath15@xmath16(contreras et al .",
    "2013 ) . also , the _ herschel space observatory _ survey , hi - gal , has mapped the galactic plane at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath14 m ( molinari et al .",
    "when the complete atlasgal and hi - gal survey source catalogs are released and are combined with the bgps catalogs , the final source catalog will contain tens of thousands of embedded sites of star formation in the milky way .",
    "the population of objects discovered in the bgps , atlasgal , and hi - gal surveys include dense starless and star - forming cores at the closest distances , clumps ( unresolved collections of cores ) , and clouds at the farthest distances ( dunham et al .",
    "in order to study the physical properties ( e.g. size , mass , luminosity ) of these embedded star - forming regions , their distances must first be determined .",
    "distances in the galactic plane may be derived using the galactic rotation curve and a measurement of the source @xmath17 . in the second and third quadrants ,",
    "kinematic distances are uniquely determined ; but , in the first and fourth quadrants , each measured @xmath17 corresponds to both a near and far kinematic distance resulting in a kinematic distance ambiguity that must be resolved using additional information .",
    "assignment of kinematic distances first and foremost requires a determination of the unique @xmath17 of the 1.1 mm clump .",

    "along lines - of - sight that cross multiple arms of the galaxy , as often happens in the first quadrant of the galaxy , co @xmath21 emission displays complicated spectral shapes with multiple components spanning many tens of km / s .",
    "the gas directly associated with the clumps is best probed by a dense molecular gas tracer .",
    "schlingman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) performed a pilot survey of slightly less than 1/3 of the bgps clumps ( 1882 sources ) in the first and second quadrant of the galactic plane in the dense gas tracers hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 ( @xmath22 @xmath19 ) .",
    "they showed that hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 are unique kinematic tracers of bgps clumps with less than @xmath23%  of sources observed displaying multiple velocity components .",
    "they also resolved the kinematic distance ambiguity of a small subset ( @xmath24 ) of the bgps clumps .",
    "schlingman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found a median radius of 0.75 pc , a median mass of @xmath25 , a median volume density of 2400 @xmath19 , and a median gravitational free - fall time of 750,000 years for this subset of sources .",
    "the resulting clump mass distribution ( @xmath26 ) had a slope of @xmath27 that is intermediate between the co cloud mass distribution ( @xmath28 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) and the salpeter imf ( @xmath29 ; salpeter 1955 ; scalo 1986 ) and is consistent with simulations of the fragmentation of turbulent compressible gas with a kolmogorov spectrum ( i.e. hennebelle & falgarone 2012 ) .",
    "schlingman et al . also observed a breakdown in the size - linewidth in the dense molecular gas probed by hco@xmath0 , possibly due to turbulent feedback on small scales from embedded protostellar sources ( see murray et al .",
    "while the schlingman survey provided an initial look the physical properties of bgps clumps , the physical properties derived from the known distance sample in that paper represents less than @xmath30%  of the full bgps v1.0.1 catalog and is biased toward the brightest 1.1 mm sources .    in this paper",

    "( 2011 ) and provide a complete spectroscopic catalog of observations of dense molecular gas as traced by hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 for all 6194 sources in the bgps v1.0.1 catalog between @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "we characterize the properties of the molecular emission ( @xmath17 , i , @xmath31 , etc . ) for the spectroscopic catalog in this paper .",

    "4705 bgps clumps in the range @xmath3@xmath4were observed during @xmath32 observing shifts between february 28 , 2011 and december 8 , 2012 with the 10 m heinrich hertz telescope ( hht ) .",
    "the source catalog was determined by observing all bolocat v1.0.1 sources that were not previously observed by schlingman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) plus re - observing sources where the pointing in schlingman et al . exceeded half the hht beamwidth ( @xmath33 ) from the v1.0.1 catalog peak 1.1 mm continuum position .",
    "re - observation of a subset ( 393 ) of the schlingman sources was necessary because the schlingman et al .",
    "observations did not have access to the final v1.0.1 catalog positions , but were instead observed with an earlier ( v0.7 ) version of the bolocat ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the observations in this paper are ultimately combined with the schlingman et al .",
    "observations for sources with good correspondence to the v1.0.1 positions ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic catalog is a complete set of observations of every source ( 6194 ) in the v1.0.1 bolocat with @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the hht observational procedure was similar to that used to observe the initial sample of 1882 bgps clumps in schlingman et al .",
    "observations were performed with the 1 mm prototype - alma dual polarization , sideband - separating receiver .",
    "the receiver was tuned to hco@xmath0  @xmath2 ( 267.5576259 ghz ) in the lower sideband ( lsb ) and to n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 ( 279.5118379 ghz ) in the upper sideband ( usb ) .",
    "rejection between the sidebands was measured by observing the bright galactic source , w75(oh ) , for @xmath30 minutes each observing shift .",
    "the median rejections for the upper sideband were @xmath35 db and @xmath36 db for vertical and horizontal polarization respectively .",
    "the 4-if output was connected to one set of filterbanks with 1 mhz spectral resolution and 512 mhz bandwidth .",
    "this spectral resolution corresponds to a velocity resolution of @xmath37 km / s in the lsb and @xmath38 km / s in the usb .",
    "each source was observed in position - switching mode with 1 minute of on - source integration time .",
    "emission free off positions for every half - degree of the galactic plane were determined by schlingman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "observations at the hht are placed on the @xmath39 scale using the standard chopper - wheel calibration method ( penzias & burrus 1973 ) .",
    "observations of planets are then used to determine the main beam efficiency and put the spectra on a final @xmath40 scale , where @xmath41 is the product of the telescope main beam efficiency and the coupling efficiency between the receiver optics for each polarization and the telescope .",
    "unfortunately , during the bulk of the observing ( 47 out of 51 shifts ) , the only planet available for observation was saturn .",
    "saturn has two potential problems for calibration .",
    "first , the rings contribute to the 1.1 mm continuum and also block continuum from the planet . fortunately though , the rings were oriented with inclinations between @xmath42  and @xmath43which",
    "correspond to the shallow minimum in the millimeter brightness temperature ( weiland et al .",
    "second , saturn also has pressure broadened ph@xmath44 @xmath45 emission at 267 ghz in the atmosphere ( encrenaz & moreno 2002 ) .",
    "the lower sideband ( hco@xmath0  @xmath2 ) calibration is strongly affected by this absorption and can not be used to calibrate the main beam efficiency .",
    "the upper sideband ( n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 ) is much less affected by ph@xmath44 absorption and was used to calibrate the upper sideband main beam efficiencies .",
    "jupiter was available for observations only after june , 2011 and the ratio between lower sideband and upper sideband efficiencies was applied to the saturn calibration to derive the lower sideband main beam efficiencies .",
    "as a consistency check , we also observed the source w75(oh ) during every shift .",
    "the integrated intensity of w75(oh ) correlates with the main beam efficiency measured using saturn ( figure 1 ) .",
    "a significant jump in the calibration is seen for both saturn and w75(oh ) at mjd = 55675 days .",
    "this discontinuity is due to a warmup of the receiver and subsequent adjustment of the feedhorn optics .",
    "the increase in efficiencies at this date occurs for all polarizations and sidebands simultaneously .",
    "the main beam efficiencies used in this paper are listed in table 1 .",
    "the final calibration numbers agree well with those used in schlingman et al .",
    "the final spectrum is the baseline rms weighted - average of the calibrated vertical and horizontal polarizations @xmath46 .      a spectroscopic survey of a large number of sources , such as the one presented in this paper , requires using a fixed source catalog during the course of the survey .",
    "at the start of the schlingman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) observations in november 2008 , the final bgps v1.0 source catalog had not been completed , so schlingman et al . utilized the preliminary bolocat v0.7 catalog .",
    "the results from those early spectroscopic observations helped tune the inputs for the seeded - watershed algorithm ultimately used to generate the v1.0 catalog ( rosolowsky et al .",
    "2010 ) . at the beginning of this current survey in february 2011 , the version 1.0.1 catalog was the latest version of the bgps source catalog available and forms the basis for this paper .",
    "in february 2013 , a re - reduction of the bgps ( version 2.0 ) became available ( ginsburg et al .",
    "simulations and testing of the new pipeline reduction plus characterization of the bgps v2.0 angular transfer function are reported in ginsburg et al .",
    "the resulting v2.0 bgps maps recover larger scale structure better than v1.0 maps .",
    "a new v2.0 source catalog using the same inputs for the seeded - watershed algorithm that was used to generate the v1.0.1 catalog is also now available ; however , the source selection algorithm has not been optimized for the noise structure in the new v2.0 maps .",
    "the fluxes quoted throughout this paper are derived from the new v2.0 bgps 1.1 mm images .",
    "since these new data products only became available after spectroscopic observations were completed ( december 2012 ) , we shall reference all spectroscopic observations sequentially in this paper to the v1.0.1 source names and catalog numbers in the spectral properties table ( tables 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the complete spectroscopic survey reaches a mean baseline rms of @xmath47 mk for spectra in the lsb and @xmath48 mk for spectra in the usb . as a result ,",
    "the mean @xmath49 limits for hco@xmath0  @xmath2 and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 in this survey are @xmath50 k and @xmath51 k respectively . during the best weather , baseline rms of @xmath52 mk",
    "were observed .",
    "the distribution of @xmath53 with galactic longitude is shown in figure 2 .",
    "detections are confirmed visually , independently in each polarization , before the final spectrum is flagged .",
    "we adopt the flagging scheme in schlingman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with two changes .",
    "we have eliminated the flag for large line wings ( flag = @xmath54 in the schlingman et al .",
    "scheme ) ; sources in the schlingman catalog with a flag of 4 have been re - classified with a flag of @xmath55 ( single peak detection ) or @xmath56 ( self - absorbed profile ) in the final catalog presented in this paper . also , to eliminate numerical gaps in our flag scheme , we have re - classified all self - absorbed profiles in the schlingman et al .",
    "catalog ( originally a flag of @xmath57 ) as a flag of @xmath56 .",
    "the flags in the merged catalog span from @xmath58 to @xmath56 and correspond to : a source with a flag = 1 indicates a single @xmath17 component detected at the @xmath59 level ; a source with a flag = 2 indicates a multiple @xmath17 components detected ; a source with a flag = 3 indicates a source with possible self - absorption ; and a source with a flag = 0 indicates a non - detection .",
    "examples of spectra with different flag combinations are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the vast majority of detections are similar to source 3054 ( g23.370 + 0.140 ) with a single gaussian peak in both hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 ( hco@xmath0  flag = @xmath55 and n@xmath1h@xmath0  flag = @xmath55 )",
    ". source 1315 ( g07.636 - 0.150 ) is an example of a n@xmath1h@xmath0  detection that is stronger than a hco@xmath0  detection while source 6620 ( g78.233 - 0.347 ) is an example of a hco@xmath0  detection and a n@xmath1h@xmath0  non - detection .",
    "source 2060 ( g14.540 - 0.210 ) is an example of a non - detection in both lines over the full velocity range permissible for objects at @xmath60   ( @xmath61 to @xmath62 km / s ) .",
    "the four panels on the right of figure 3 display examples of detections with multiple velocity peaks .",
    "source 3244 ( g24.143 + 0.128 ) shows two clearly separated velocity peaks ( @xmath63 km / s ) indicative of two physically separate dense clumps along the same line - of - sight .",
    "occasionally , the two peaks are blended . in the case of source 2162 ( g15.079 - 0.604 ) , the n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 spectrum peaks at the same velocity as one of the hco@xmath0  @xmath2 peaks ; therefore , we do not classify this source as a self - absorbed profile , but as multiple velocity components in hco@xmath0  @xmath2 ( hco@xmath0  flag = @xmath23 ) .",
    "the two panels on the bottom right of figure 3 show examples of blue - skewed and red - skewed self - absorbed hco@xmath0  @xmath2 profiles where the n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 emission does peak near the self - absorption minima ( hco@xmath0  flag = @xmath56 ) .",
    "the detection fractions for each spectroscopic flag are summarized in pie charts in figure 4 .",
    "hco@xmath0  @xmath2 emission was detected toward a total of @xmath64 ( @xmath65% ) sources .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 emission was detected toward a smaller fraction , @xmath66 ( @xmath67% ) sources .",
    "multiple velocity components are rare in these dense gas tracers with @xmath68 hco@xmath0  @xmath2 multiple velocity detections ( @xmath9% ) and @xmath69 n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 multiple velocity detections ( @xmath70% ) .",
    "there are only @xmath54 n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 detections ( @xmath71% ) that lack a corresponding hco@xmath0  @xmath2 detection . none of these four unique n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 detections are very significant , only ranging from @xmath72 .",
    "as an example , source 1705 ( g012.387 + 00.230 ) has a @xmath73 detection in @xmath74 for n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 but there is a potential hco@xmath0  3 - 2 detection at only @xmath75 which falls just short of the criteria set in this paper for a hco@xmath0  detection flag = 1 .",
    "strong n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 emission without an hco@xmath0  @xmath2 detection does not occur for the bgps sources observed in this spectroscopic catalog .",
    "therefore , we have observed a unique velocity component for @xmath76 sources ( @xmath5% ) in the bolocat v1.0.1 within the range @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath74 for both tracers are shown in figure 5 .",
    "both histograms peak just above the @xmath77 limit indicating that deeper integration is likely to detect more sources in the lines of hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 .",
    "the total observing time for the complete spectroscopic survey is @xmath78 hours ; a modest decrease of a factor of two in the rms noise level would require four times longer than the current survey .",
    "the detection statistics are a function of galactic longitude in this survey ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the detection fraction does not strongly correlate with the baseline rms in the survey ( figure 5 ) .",
    "for instance , the region near @xmath79  which has the largest number of 1.1 mm sources within a @xmath55  bin has a detection fraction of only @xmath52%  despite having small baseline rms compared to the entire survey ( @xmath80 mk ) .",
    "an opposite example can be found at @xmath81  where a higher baseline rms results in a lower detection fraction ; however , these instances are rare in this survey .    in order to understand this result",
    ", we must first compare the detection statistics to the flux density of bgps sources .",
    "the detection fraction is a strong function of the @xmath8 mm flux density of bgps sources ( figure 4 ) .",
    "v1.0.1 sources with @xmath8 mm flux densities below 200 mjy have a less than @xmath82%detection percentage with the detection fraction decreasing rapidly below this flux density .",
    "this flux density corresponds to a column density limit of @xmath83 @xmath84 assuming a dust temperature of 20 k , gas mass to dust mass ratio of 100:1 , and ossenkopf & henning opacities ( @xmath85 @xmath86 g@xmath87 ; ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",
    "in contrast , sources with flux densities above 500 mjy have a detection fraction approaching @xmath88%   ( n@xmath89 @xmath84 ) . these variations in detection fraction with galactic longitude primarily represent variations in the number of low flux density sources selected by the bolocat seeded - watershed algorithms in different , sometimes crowded , regions of the galactic plane ( see figure 17 of rosolowsky et al .",
    "the region toward @xmath79  contains a larger fraction of low flux density ( @xmath90 mjy ) sources than other regions in the galactic plane resulting in the lower overall detection fraction .",
    "this @xmath91  region of the galactic plane is crowded and confused as the observed line - of - sight crosses the sagittarius arm , the tangent of the end of the molecular bar , perseus arm , and an outer galactic arm .",
    "we can test the fidelity of low flux density sources in the v1.0.1 catalog by directly comparing to the detection statistics with the new v2.0 catalog . for sources with no v2.0 catalog counterpart within @xmath92  of the v1.0.1 source position ( 1813 sources ) , the hco@xmath0  @xmath2 non - detection fraction ( hco@xmath0  flag = 0 ) increases from @xmath93%  for the complete v1.0.1 catalog to @xmath94%  for this subset .",
    "nearly half of all v1.0.1 hco@xmath0  @xmath2 non - detections are no longer directly associated with sources in the v2.0 catalog .",
    "furthermore , those v1.0.1 sources that lack a v2.0 counterpart are predominantly low flux density v1.0.1 sources ( ginsburg et al . , 2013 ) a significant fraction of low flux density v1.0.1 sources may not be real or are low volume density sources at the limit of statistical significance in the 1.1 mm map .",
    "conversely , there are 476 v1.0.1 sources which have hco@xmath0  @xmath2 detections ( hco@xmath0  flag = 1 or 3 ) but no nearby ( @xmath95 ) counterpart in the v2.0 catalog .",
    "these results indicate that the v2.0 catalog has a better chance of selecting clumps with detectable dense molecular gas ( at the limit of this spectroscopic survey ) but that the v2.0 catalog is incomplete and misses a significant number of sources with dense molecular gas in the bgps survey .",
    "this comparison only serves to highlight the difficulties inherent in source selection algorithms and also how surveys of dense molecular gas may be used to test the fidelity of those source catalogs .",
    "in this section , we analyze the properties of the hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 emission for the complete set of @xmath96 spectroscopic detections .",
    "the spectra are analyzed using the same analysis techniques presented in schlingman et al .",
    "namely , a single component gaussian is fit to hco@xmath0  @xmath2 spectra while a multiple - component hyperfine fit is performed on n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 spectra . in cases where a single component gaussian fit fails or is not appropriate to described the observed line shape , the velocity of @xmath97",

    "in addition to the molecular lines observed in this survey , nh@xmath44 is another popular dense gas tracer because it is easily excited in dense molecular gas and the ratio of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines may be used to determine the gas kinetic temperature ( ho & townes 1983 ) . there have been two substantial galactic nh@xmath44 surveys published in the past two years .",

    "this also corresponds to a secondary maximum in the galactic longitude distribution of sources in the first quadrant ( aguirre et al .",

    "since the bgps is confined to @xmath108  for most longitude ranges , the bgps has difficulty tracing sources in the newly discovered outermost arm of the milky way ( dame & thaddeus 2011 ) because the galactic warp projects sources to galactic latitudes greater than the typical @xmath70  extent of the bgps .",

    "gas kinetic temperature and dust temperature are only expected to be well coupled at high densities ( @xmath235 @xmath19 ; see goldsmith 2000 ) ; however , in the absence of other information , it is a better approximation than assuming all sources are at the same dust temperature .",
    "the plotted column density errorbars are purely statistical errors based on the uncertainty in @xmath53 . the total uncertainty in the hco@xmath0  column density is dominated by the uncertainty in the unknown filling fraction of emission and the uncertainty in the unknown optical depth which would likely increase the column density by factors of a few . with these caveats in mind , we plot the hco@xmath0  column density and abundances in figure 14 .",
    "in contrast with the integrated intensity correlation (  4.2 ) , there is no correlation between the hco@xmath0  and h@xmath1 column densities .",
    "this result again highlights the importance of the excitation conditions and not the total molecular column density in driving the observed intensity correlations . a similar lack of correlation",
    "was also observed for nh@xmath44 column densities versus h@xmath1 column densities by wienen et al .",
    "we find a median hco@xmath0  abundance of @xmath236 .",
    "the hco@xmath0  abundance also shows no discernible trend with galactocentric radius ( figure 14 ) .",
    "this result is in contrast with nh@xmath44 observations which show a decrease by a factor of 7 in abundance with galactocentric radius ( dunham et al .",
    "both studies are limited by a paucity of sources at large galactocentric radius with measured gas kinetic temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , we can not easily calculate the optical depth in the n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 line because the 45 hyperfine lines are too heavily blended to obtain believable constraints .",
    "furthermore , observations of the @xmath237 isotopologue is prohibitive because the interstellar @xmath238/[^{14}\\rm{n}]$ ] abundance is a factor of @xmath239 smaller than the ism @xmath186/[^{12}\\rm{c}]$ ] abundance ( wilson & rood 1994 , adande & ziurys 2012 ) .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 is also very likely sub - thermally populated based on our radiative transfer calculations . given the more than order of magnitude uncertainties , we do not report column densities for n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 emission .",
    "we recommend observations of the n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath21 line where the hyperfine splitting is more easily resolved ( e.g. , pirogov et al .",
    "2003 , pirogov et al .",
    "2007 , reiter et al .",
    "2011a , barnes et al . 2013 ) .      while most hco@xmath0  @xmath2 lines in the survey",
    "are believed to have @xmath240 based on limited h@xmath112co@xmath0 @xmath2 observations and comparison to radiative transfer models (  4.4 ) , there is a small percentage of sources that display clear line asymmetries indicative of kinematic motions coupled with very optically thick lines . for a hco@xmath0  @xmath2 line profile",
    "to be classified as self - absorbed , the profile must show two peaks and an absorption dip over the span of at least 3 channels ( @xmath7 km / s ) with the n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath2 line profile having a single - peak ( hco@xmath0  flag = @xmath56 while n@xmath1h@xmath0  flag = @xmath55 ) .",
    "this situation occurs for @xmath241 ( @xmath9% ) sources ( table 5 ) .",
    "self - absorbed line profiles are extremely rare in this survey .",
    "this may , in part , be due to the low spectral resolution ( @xmath8 km / s ) required to cover the full velocity range ( @xmath61 to @xmath242 km / s ) of sources in the longitude range observed in the first quadrant .    we may classify the self - absorbed sources sources as blue , red , or equal asymmetries by the location of the @xmath243 maximum .",
    "@xmath244 sources have a clear blue asymmetry while @xmath245 sources have a clear red asymmetry and @xmath136 sources have equal height peaks .",
    "the blue excess for the subset of sources showing distinct self - absorption is @xmath246 .",
    "these @xmath241 sources ( listed in table 4 ) are excellent high - mass , large - scale collapse candidates ( see reiter et al .",
    "2011b ) and should be followed up at higher spatial resolution .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a complete spectroscopic catalog for all sources in the bgps v1.0.1 source catalog with @xmath3@xmath4and characterized the properties of the molecular emission .",
    "3126 sources ( @xmath5% ) were detected with unique @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath2 is a significantly better kinematic tracer of bgps clumps than co isotopologues with contamination from multiple velocity components rare ( only @xmath9% ) .",
    "the detection fraction of bgps v1.0.1 sources is @xmath247%  for 1.1 mm sources with flux densities @xmath248 mjy and @xmath249%  for flux densities @xmath250 mjy .",
    "the majority of bgps clumps appear to be physically associated with other clumps .",
    "this is the largest targeted dense gas survey of the milky way to date and traces the major spiral arm structures of the milky way in galactocentric radius .",
    "hco@xmath0  and n@xmath1h@xmath0  molecular intensities are well correlated with 1.1 mm flux density and with each other while molecular column densities are not well correlated with the total h@xmath1 column density .",
    "hco@xmath0  @xmath2 intensity",
    "is also correlated with gas kinetic temperature .",
    "hco@xmath0  @xmath2 emission is likely optically thick and sub - thermally populated ( @xmath251 k @xmath252 ) toward most bpgs clumps .",
    "these observed intensity correlations are most likely due to the sensitivity of the @xmath2 transitions to excitation conditions probed by the dense gas .",
    "the molecular intensity ratio does not correlate with 1.1 mm flux density , @xmath148 , or @xmath31 .",
    "bgps clumps are likely composed of smaller cores which may have a range of different chemical and excitation conditions .",

    "the observed linewidth does not correlate with 1.1 mm flux density or @xmath148 although the lower bound of @xmath31 does correlated with both quantities .    in the coming months",
    ", source catalogs from the atlasgal and hi - gal continuum surveys of the galaxy will be released .",
