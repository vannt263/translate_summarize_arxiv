    "the effective theory on @xmath0 branes is special in that the basic excitations , the selfdual strings , are @xmath21 objects other than the @xmath22 objects , like those on @xmath23 branes or @xmath24 branes @xcite .",
    "if the selfdual strings can be closed and can shrink to point like the fundamental strings , then we will still have a theory with the semi - point - like excitations . for selfdual strings without the charge ,",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "in abelian theory , the quantization of the point - like @xmath24 confined to @xmath0 brane gives the @xmath25 tensor multiplet @xcite .",
    "moreover , the basic excitations on @xmath25 little string theory @xcite living on @xmath26 coincident type iia @xmath27 branes are closed fundamental strings , which are also the closed selfdual strings coming from @xmath24 wrapping the m theory circle intersecting @xmath27 along a closed curve .",
    "there is no evidence showing that for selfdual strings carrying charge , the situation is the same .",
    "consider @xmath28 branes , which are @xmath0 branes compactified on @xmath29 .",

    "however , the classical instanton solution with charge @xmath11 $ ] is associated with the @xmath11 $ ] monopole string extending along a straight line , while the point - like , centered around a point . ]",
    "@xmath31 bps instanton solutions are always chargeless .",
    "the closed monopole string with no @xmath30 charge is the selfdual string with the winding number and the momentum both zero along @xmath29 , which will give a @xmath1 massless sym field in adjoint representation of @xmath6 , in addition to the original @xmath1 sym field coming from the selfdual strings winding @xmath29 once .",
    "the sym field like this is always massless even if the @xmath28 branes are separated from each other , so it will dominate at the coulomb branch . however , on @xmath28 , no such field exists .",
    "we do not get the clue for the existence of the closed charged selfdual strings .",
    "actually , when the charged selfdual string becomes curved , different parts of it may exert force to each other , so it can not vibrate freely and can not be closed as the chargeless strings do",
    ".    then we have to incorporate the @xmath21 object in a @xmath2 field theory . in this paper",
    ", we will take the @xmath11 $ ] tensionless selfdual string extending along , for example , the @xmath29 direction , as the point - like @xmath2 excitation , which is in the position eigenstate in @xmath32 space but in the @xmath33 momentum eigenstate in @xmath29 .",
    "if so , selfdual strings extending along the same direction can not give the complete hilbert space for the 6d particle . to get the full hilbert space , we need to consider selfdual strings with the orientations covering all directions in a plane .",
    "the superposition of the selfdual strings parallel to a plane can give the 6d point - like excitations localized in 12345 space , but it seems that somehow , the position representation is not the suitable one , since it is the @xmath11 $ ] selfdual strings other than the @xmath11 $ ] point - like excitations that naturally exist .",
    "one plane is already enough to define a @xmath2 field theory , so different planes may give the u - dual versions of the same @xmath2 theory .",
    "this is quite similar with the @xmath34 sym theory , for which , one @xmath7 string defines a @xmath35 field theory , while the rest @xmath7 strings give the s - dual @xmath35 theories .",
    "theories with the line - like excitations are intrinsically different from those with the point - like excitations",
    ". if the excitations are line - like , a reduction on @xmath29 will give the selfdual strings extending along @xmath29 , while a further reduction on @xmath36 will make @xmath37 .",
    "the first reduction selects a particular selfdual string ; the second one is just the ordinary reduction in local field theories . with @xmath38 and @xmath3 switched",
    ", we will get the selfdual strings extending along @xmath36 with @xmath33 , which is s - dual to the selfdual strings extending along @xmath29 with @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the excitations are point - like , both sequences will give the point - like selfdual strings with @xmath39 .",
    "in @xcite , witten has shown that due to the conformal symmetry , the @xmath40 and @xmath41 reductions of the @xmath2 @xmath25 theory will give two s - dual @xmath35 sym theories other than one @xmath35 theory , which strongly indicates that the basic excitations on @xmath0 can not be point - like .",
    "recall that in @xcite , the equations of motion for the 3-algebra valued @xmath25 tensor multiplet contain a constant vector field @xmath42 .",
    "a given @xmath42 will reduce the dynamics from @xmath2 to @xmath1 . however , if @xmath42 covers all directions in a plane , we will get a set of @xmath43-parameterized @xmath1 sym theories sym theory already contains the complete kk modes of the @xmath2 theory @xcite .",
    "the kk modes are realized as the field configurations in @xmath44 carrying the nonzero pontryagin number . here",

    "this is actually a special kind of kk compactification , using the polar coordinate other than the rectangular coordinate .",
    "suppose the selfdual string orientations are restricted in @xmath40 plane , then the common eigenstates of @xmath46 $ ] could be selected as the bases to generate the hilbert space .",
    "in this respect , it is convenient to consider the kk mode of the @xmath2 @xmath25 theory with @xmath36 and @xmath29 compactified to circles with the radii @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath0 branes with the longitudinal @xmath36 and @xmath29 compactified is dual to the @xmath9 branes with the transverse @xmath49 compactified .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the 2-form field on @xmath50 is converted to the transverse positions of the @xmath9 branes on @xmath49 .",
    "the duality differs from the t - duality in that two longitudinal dimensions are converted to one transverse dimension so the total dimensions are reduced from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 momentum mode of the @xmath2 theory is dual to the @xmath7 string winding @xmath49 @xmath54 times , with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 co - prime .",

    "sym coupling is obtained by studying the scattering amplitude of the open strings ending on @xmath23 branes .",
    "@xmath11 + [ j , k ]",

    ", we need to consider the scattering of the selfdual strings parallel to a given plane .",
    "selfdual strings with the same orientation still have the sym - coupling , while for selfdual strings with different orientations , the @xmath11+[j , k ] \\rightarrow [ i , k]$ ] relation is not valid , so the @xmath11 $ ] @xmath53 mode , the @xmath13 $ ] @xmath62 mode , and the @xmath63 $ ] @xmath64 mode of the @xmath2 field can not couple unless @xmath65 , in which case all of them belong to the same @xmath1 sym theory with @xmath66 .",
    "the difference between the sym theory and the effective theory on @xmath0 s is rooted in the fact that the boundary of the open string is the point , while the boundary of the open @xmath24 is the line .",

    ", one can reconstruct the original @xmath2 sym theory .",
    "similarly , for @xmath0 , we need to consider the interaction of the open @xmath7 strings ending on @xmath9 winding @xmath49 @xmath54 times for all co - prime @xmath7 and all nonnegative @xmath54 , or in other words , the interaction for all of the monopoles and dyons in @xmath34 sym theory .",

    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the longitudinal momentum mode on branes with special emphasis on the point - like charged @xmath31 bps instantons on @xmath28 branes . in section 3 , we consider the selfdual strings on @xmath0 branes parallel to the @xmath40 plane , or equivalently , the kk momentum mode of the @xmath2 theory upon the compactification on @xmath50 . in section 4",
    ", we study the interaction of the @xmath2 @xmath25 theory by considering its kk mode on @xmath50 . in section 5 , we consider various momentum - carrying bps states in @xmath1 sym theory , especially , the monopole string carrying the longitudinal momentum and the string carrying @xmath30 charge . in section 6 , we discuss the states living at the triple intersection of @xmath0 branes .",
    "the discussion is in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the longitudinal momentum mode on @xmath0 branes , which is carried by selfdual strings .",
    "we will argue that there is no closed charged selfdual strings and so no classical point - like charged momentum mode on @xmath0 branes .",
    "nevertheless , on @xmath26 coincident @xmath28 branes , the localized @xmath11 $ ] @xmath98 mode ( d0 brane ) could be realized as the quantum superposition of the @xmath11 $ ] @xmath98 mode in momentum eigenstate of , for example , @xmath99 , which is the @xmath11 $ ] tensionless monopole string wrapping @xmath36 , carrying the @xmath30 charge as well as the @xmath99 longitudinal momentum , or equivalently , the @xmath11 $ ] @xmath101 string on @xmath9 if @xmath36 is compactified .",
    "the @xmath1 massive nonabelian @xmath25 tensor multiplet with mass @xmath102 could then be decomposed into a tower of @xmath35 massive @xmath6 vector multiplet arising from the quantization of the @xmath101 open strings for all @xmath103 .",
    "let us first see the transverse momentum of the branes . for a @xmath104 brane with the transverse dimension @xmath105 compactified to a circle @xmath87 , the brane may locate at a particular point in @xmath87 or have the definite momentum along @xmath87 . in the former situation , after the t - duality transformation along @xmath105 , @xmath104 becomes @xmath106 with the gauge field @xmath107 getting the vacuum expectation value . in the latter case ,",

    "especially , on coincident @xmath0 branes , the 3-string junctions are at best at the marginal stability curve , so it is quite likely that they may decay .",

    "only one is selected to give the @xmath35 field , while the rest ones define the dual theories .",
