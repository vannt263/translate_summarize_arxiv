    "the quest for the origin of elementary particle masses is arguably one of the most important tasks in current high energy physics . according to the standard model ( sm ) , a scalar field",
    "is employed to break the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry down to the electromagnetic ( em ) symmetry , @xmath3 , giving masses to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons that mediate weak interactions .",
    "this so - called higgs mechanism @xcite is achieved when the scalar field spontaneously acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) due to the instability in its potential . as a consequence ,",
    "the sm predicts the existence of a spin-0 higgs boson . with the introduction of yukawa interactions ,",
    "fermionic particles can obtain their masses from the same higgs field as well .",
    "therefore , the discovery of the higgs boson does not only complete the particle spectrum of the sm , but also reveals the secrets of ew symmetry breaking and mass .",
    "recently , both atlas and cms collaborations @xcite of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have reported the observation of a higgs - like resonance at around 125 gev at @xmath6 level through the combination of @xmath2 and @xmath0 channels .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath0 channel , the observed cross section is @xmath7 and @xmath8 times larger than the expected cross section in the sm at the atlas and the cms , respectively .",
    "measurements in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and the @xmath12 channels are in general consistent with the sm expectations . around this mass region ,",
    "another decay channel that is closely related to the diphoton mode and clean in the lhc environment is the @xmath1 mode . at the leading order in the sm , both the @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite are loop processes mediated by the same particles .",
    "new particles beyond the sm can change their relative magnitudes .",
    "although the @xmath2 decay occurs at tree level and is less sensitive to new particle contributions , the rate depends on how the ew symmetry is broken .",
    "therefore , a simultaneous measurement of their production rates will be helpful in diagnosing the observed higgs - like particle .    in view of the 125 gev higgs boson , denoted by @xmath13",
    ", we consider models that have only an extended higgs sector for simplicity .",
    "there are some recent studies in the literature about the @xmath14 decay in models with an extended higgs sector  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate both the @xmath14 and @xmath1 decays in models with higgs extensions based on various physics motivations .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 is sm - like , meaning that the couplings of @xmath13 with fermions ( @xmath15 ) as well as the weak gauge bosons ( @xmath16 ) are the same as the sm ones .",
    "this is consistent with the current experimental observations . in this case , the production cross section of @xmath13 is the same as in the sm , and the deviations in the event rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states from the sm predictions are purely due to the modified decay rates of the two modes .",
    "we study how the decay rates of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are modified ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] classifies models with simple extensions in the higgs sector and give the corresponding quantum numbers for new scalar fields under the sm electroweak group .",
    "the formulae for the modified decay rates of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are also given in this section .",
    "constraints from perturbativity and vacuum stability on the model parameters are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the effects of new scalar bosons on the two decay modes are also analyzed in detail .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in general , models with an extended higgs sector often contain charged higgs bosons that , among other phenomena , can contribute to the @xmath14 and @xmath1 decays through the loop effect .",
    "although there are many possibilities for the extended higgs sector , we discuss those with extra @xmath21 singlets @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , doublet @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) , and triplets @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 and @xmath23 ) , whose charge assignments are given in table  [ tb : charge ] .",
    ".charge assignments for extra scalar fields under the @xmath29 gauge symmetry . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to see the correlation between the decay rates of @xmath20 and @xmath0 , we further define the ratio of the two decay rates : @xmath30 first , we give the sm expectations of the two diboson decays of the higgs boson in table  [ tb : sm ] , where @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev are used .",
    "next , we show numerical results for the case with an extended higgs sector . as mentioned before , we assume that the observed higgs boson is sm - like in couplings with the gauge bosons and fermions in our numerical studies . moreover , we present the results for the case where the charged scalar bosons are at least 300 gev in mass .    for meaningful discussions ,",
    "we calculate parameter bounds by considering perturbativity and vacuum stability constraints .",
    "the perturbativity condition requires that the magnitudes of all dimensionless coupling constants do not exceed @xmath33 . for vacuum stability",
    ", we require that the scalar potential is bounded from below in the parameter space where the quartic terms dominate . combining the two bounds",
    ", we obtain the following conditions for classes  i , ii and iii , respectively : @xmath34 it is noted that these conditions can be modified by some quartic couplings in the scalar potential that are neglected in our analysis . in the following analysis , we use these conditions to constrain the @xmath35 parameters for a given value of @xmath36 .",
