    "the staggered fermion field @xmath10 of charge one leads to the global u(1 ) chiral symmetry of the model in the chiral limit , i.e.  when the bare fermion mass @xmath11 vanishes",
    ".    a detailed discussion of the phase diagram and its investigation can be found in @xcite .",
    "a major tool in the examination of universality classes is the determination of critical exponents by finite size scaling analysis . to get experience with this method we investigate the model in the quenched approximation , which corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "this model is known by itself under the names ` scalar qed ' or ` u(1)-higgs model ' . in this model",
    "the 1@xmath13 order higgs - pt ends in a critical point ( e@xmath14 ) .",
    "the scaling at this point was investigated in @xcite along the 1@xmath13 order line , indicating mean - field exponents .",
    "we investigate the scaling along different lines passing through e@xmath14 .",
    "first of all it is convenient to introduce two reduced couplings ( fig .  [",
    "fig : par ] ) : +    [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]      + the letter @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been chosen in correspondence to temperature and external field of a magnetic system .",
    "we now introduce critical exponents for both directions .",
    "the correlation length critical exponents @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the correlation length .",
    "the corresponding exponents connected with the heat capacity are called @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    to understand the connection between @xmath17 and @xmath18 we regard the scaling relation @xmath23 with the scaling function @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",

    "the mean - field exponents @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    typically , the most precise way to determine the correlation length critical exponent numerically is the measurement of the finite size scaling of the edge singularity in the complex coupling plane ( fisher zeros ) . from scaling arguments for the free energy we expect for the first zero @xmath35 : @xmath36 because all directions non - parallel to the 1@xmath13 order pt are equivalent , we expect the same exponent @xmath18 also if we fix @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "we did a numerical simulation at @xmath39 on lattices from @xmath40 to @xmath41 at 5 to 10 @xmath42 values with a statistic per point between 32000 and 192000 measurements , each separated by 4 metropolis sweeps .",
    "for the determination of the zeros we use a multihistogram reweighting with 10000 bins .",
    "[ fig : fisher1 ] shows nice scaling for all lattice sizes with a critical exponent @xmath43 .",
    "this exponent is quite near to the mean - field exponent @xmath44 .",
    "the small deviations outside the error bars might be due to logarithmic corrections , which are to be expected at a gaussian fixpoint . we intend to check this by methods as described in @xcite for the 4d ising model .    a similar exponent has also been measured in the su(2)-higgs model  @xcite , but it was not realized , that this is compatible with a gaussian fixpoint .    to check this scaling ,",
    "we have also determined the specific heat and a fourth order cumulant : @xmath45 here @xmath46 can be any linear combination of @xmath47 and @xmath48 that s picks up also the orthogonal component @xmath49 ( for def . of @xmath49 see @xcite ) .",
    "we checked this for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we expect the following scaling relation to hold : @xmath50 there might be a regular contribution to @xmath51 , but our data show no indication for this , and so we do not add any constant in our fits .",
    "the first two observables show nice scaling for all lattice sizes with exponents in good agreement of those determined by the fisher zeros .",
    "small deviations indicate systematic uncertainties a little larger than the statistical errors .",
    "we also checked the finite size scaling of the real part of the fisher zeros , as we do for the pseudocritical coupling , determined by the extrema of the cumulants ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kcre ] ) .",
    "the value of the shift exponent @xmath52 is compatible with @xmath53 .",
    "to check the claim , that @xmath18 is independent of the direction , we also made some runs for fixed @xmath42 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fisher2 ] .",

    "@xmath58 is on the 1@xmath13 order line , corresponding to @xmath59 . in both cases clear deviations from a linear scaling",
    "can be observed , with the right tendency for increasing lattice size .",
    "the straight lines are just plotted to visualize the deviations .",
    "both observations support the reliability of this finite size scaling method .",
    "a rich spectrum is to be expected near the tricritical point e , significantly different from that of the second order chiral pt line ne .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite and here we want to show some new results .",
    "we fix @xmath60 , because the @xmath42 of the endpoint ( for small fixed @xmath11 ) turned out to be less dependent on @xmath11 than @xmath61 .",
    "as shown in @xcite we observe strong finite size effects .",
    "the boson mass @xmath62 ( scalar bound state of @xmath8 s ) shows a pronounced dip at the critical point , which shifts with the volume and @xmath11 .",
    "it turned out , that those dips fall together , if one plots @xmath62 as a function of the fermion mass @xmath63 .    to investigate the scaling , we look for the mass ratio @xmath64 ( fig .  [ fig : massratio ] ) .",
    "the sudden increase of this ratio for small @xmath63 indicates the symmetric phase , with @xmath63 vanishing ( up to finite size effects ) .",
    "the nearly constant value of this ratio in the broken phase may indicate that both particles survive in the continuum limit with a mass ratio around 1/2 .",
    "we also measure different ` mesons ' ( fermion - antifermion bound states ) , defined in @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath65 particle is very hard to measure , due to its vacuum quantum numbers and the nonvanishing background expectation value connected with this .",
    "so we show here the results for the @xmath66-meson ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mes ] ) .",
    "we interpret this data as an indication for @xmath66 surviving in the continuum limit as a resonance .",
    "the investigation of the tricritical point in the @xmath67-model makes further progress . the mass ratio @xmath64 approaches a constant value , supporting the expectation , that the continuum limit is substantially different from that of the njl model .",
    "this strengthens the hope , that the theory might be renormalizable and a model for dynamical mass generation .",
    "we hope to get a deeper understanding of the scaling behavior by means of the finite size scaling analysis ."
