    "this paper tests a dielectric model @xcite for variation of hydration free energy with geometry of complex solutes in water .",
    "it works out some basic aspects of the theory of boundary integral methods for these problems and describes , demonstrates , and tests such algorithms for solution of that macroscopic poisson equation .",
    "it then makes some observations about extension of this continuum model incrementally to reintroduce molecular detail of the solvation structure",
    ".    numerical solution of these models has been discussed many times before .",
    "dielectric continuum models are widely considered simplistic descriptions of the solvation of charged or polar solutes in solutions .",
    "thus , it might not be obvious whether accurate solutions to the governing poisson equation are important . however , when solved to thermal accuracy these models can give helpful and interesting descriptions of the variation of solvation free energy with geometry @xcite .",
    "these dielectric models are physical .",
    "furthermore , their connection with molecular theory is known and straightforward @xcite . for these reasons",
    "the dielectric models deserve to be exploited more thoroughly than they have been .",
    "these interesting properties of the physical model require methods that yield solvation free energies accurate on the thermal energy scale ( @xmath0 under the conditions of widest interest ) .",
    "experience has shown that this level of accuracy can be difficult to achieve and requires careful numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the poisson equation is a linear equation and the chief difficulty is associated with the treatment of interface boundary conditions on a molecular surface that can be irregular .",
    "the possibility of disconnection of the molecular surface with molecular rearrangement is of utmost physical importance .",
    "viewed from a physical level , those disconnections can produce microscopic solvent pockets that the model treats as bulk continuum solvent .",
    "it might be questioned whether the model is significantly less accurate in those circumstances .",
    "viewed on a technical level , those disconnections greatly complicate the description of the molecular - solvent interface . because spatial resolution in the description of that interface is important to achieving accuracy in the solutions , it might be further questioned whether it is feasible or desirable to obtain solutions of the models that are sufficiently accurate to examine the effects of those disconnections . but",
    "boundary element approaches are expected to be particularly appropriate for these purposes .",
    "this has been clearly expressed by yoon and lenhoff @xcite .",
    "the development here follows that idea but accomplishes the required boundary ( or surface ) integrations utilizing two simple procedures : ( a ) plaques are defined on the basis of quasi - random number or ` good lattice ' multidimensional integration methods @xcite ; and ( b ) integrations over plaques are accomplished by monte carlo methods .",
    "this results in the computational method that is simple and general , that lends itself to demonstration of numerical convergence , and that permits a systematic exploitation of coarse grained results .",
    "the _ a priori _ theoretical support for these models is limited ; it has been mentioned above that they are physical and have a known simple connection to molecular theory .",
    "an additional point that is important for molecular justification of the continuum theory is that the interactions being treated , electrostatic interactions , are long - ranged on the scale of molecular sizes @xcite . because the theoretical justification of these models is limited , empirical validation for the anticipated applications is important .",
    "therefore , this paper presents a number of examples of dielectric model predictions of potentials of mean forces for rearrangements of molecular species and reactive complexes in water .",
    "it deserves emphasis that the issue of the validity of these models for predictions of changes in solvation free energy with changes in molecular geometry is distinct from those of accuracy for one geometry or of accuracy for changes in charge distribution at a fixed geometry .",
    "most of the previous applications , electronic structure calculations and electron transfer theories , appear to rely on answers to the latter question .",
    "preliminary results for several of the examples below have appeared in our previous work @xcite .",
    "but with the exception of @xcite this is the only available work that obtains and studies potentials of mean forces , _",
    "i.e. _ variations of solvation free energies with geometry , accurate on the thermal energy scale . note also @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite provided an important motivation for the present work .",
    "we consider a molecule in a solution environment and identify that molecule as the ` solute ' of interest .",
    "a solute volume is defined on the basis of its geometry .",
    "partial charges describing the solute electric charge distribution are positioned within this volume .",
    "the poisson equation of interest is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of electric charge associated with the solute molecule , the function @xmath3 gives the local value of the dielectric constant , and the solution @xmath4 is the electric potential .",
    "when contributions from an external surface vanish , the fundamental solutions of this poisson equation are solutions of the integral equations :    [ inteq ] @xmath5 { \\varepsilon ( { \\bf r}'')g({\\bf r}'',{\\bf r } ' ) } d^3r '' } , \\label{inteqa}\\ ] ] @xmath6\\bullet \\left ( { { { \\varepsilon ( { \\bf r}'')-1 } \\over { 4\\pi } } } \\right ) \\left [ { \\nabla ' ' g({\\bf r}'',{\\bf r } ' ) } \\right]d^3r '' } , \\label{inteqb}\\ ] ] @xmath7 \\bullet { \\nabla ' ' g({\\bf r}'',{\\bf r}')\\varepsilon ( { \\bf r } ' ) d^3r''}.   \\label{inteqc}\\ ] ]    the derivation of these equations is discussed in an appendix . here @xmath8 is the green function for eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] )  the electric potential at @xmath9 due to a unit source at @xmath10  and @xmath11 is the green function for the case where @xmath12 .",
    "these equations apply both to the ` unbounded case ' and to periodic boundary conditions . for the latter case the potential is only required in a cell of volume v and the integral need only cover that volume .",
    "but in the latter case the electric potential due to a unit source `` @xmath13 '' is then the traditional ewald potential .",
    "that result also is discussed in an appendix .",
    "it will be worthwhile to note that eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) are specializations of the more general relations that arise from considering how to calculate @xmath14 for a specified @xmath3 with the help of a separately known @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "those more general relations are :    [ refinteq ] @xmath17 \\varepsilon({\\bf r } '' ) g({\\bf r}'',{\\bf r } ' ) d^3r '' , \\label{refinteqa ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath18\\bullet \\left ( { { { \\varepsilon ( { \\bf r}'')- \\varepsilon^{(0)}({\\bf r } '' ) } \\over { 4\\pi } } } \\right ) { \\nabla ' ' g({\\bf r}'',{\\bf r } ' ) } d^3r '' } , \\label{refinteqb}\\ ] ] @xmath19    again , the derivation of these equations is discussed in an appendix .",
    "these equations will be of subsequent help in the design of numerical methods to treat systems for which the solute volume is not efficiently described as a finite collection of finite spheres , _",
    "e.g. _ , systems that include slabs and cylinders .      in the customary applications of dielectric models a molecular volume is defined and the region outside this molecular volume is assigned a local value of the dielectric constant , @xmath3 , equal to the measured dielectric constant of the solution .",
    "it is with the definition of the molecular volume that molecular scale information of the solvation structure , otherwise external to the model , is incorporated .",
    "it should be recognized that the defined molecular volume typically will change with the thermodynamic state of the system , with the structure of the solute , with solute - solvent interactions , and with correlations among solvent molecules .",
    "we comment later on the statistical thermodynamical underpinning of the model that clarifies the molecular origin of that information",
    ". the description of the molecular surface should be simple and should permit disconnection with molecular rearrangement .",
    "smoothness is desirable .",
    "the most popular previous choice has been the connolly surface @xcite defined as a surface of contact between a spherical probe and the van der waals surface of the molecule .",
    "we have chosen instead to define the volume of a molecular complex in terms of a collection of spheres , each member @xmath20 of that collection having an individually specified radius , @xmath21 , and center , @xmath22 .",
    "the volume enclosed by spheres in this collection is the ` molecular volume . '",
    "it is expected that the molecular volume will contain the source charges but that limitation could be straightforwardly relaxed .",
    "the molecular surface is defined as the boundary of the molecular volume . generally , some of the surfaces of the individual spheres will be inside other spheres ; some spherical surface will be buried and will not contribute to the molecular surface .",
    "our considerations for making this choice of the molecular surface rather than the connolly surface are that it is simpler and no less physical .",
    "the connolly surface has the advantage of better smoothness for compact molecular conformations .",
    "but it has the disadvantage that disconnection upon continuous conformational change either leaves sharp ` cusps ' or , if those cusps are arbitrarily shaved - off , the volume changes discontinuously . since the statistical thermodynamic connection of the defined molecular surface to the solvation structure is somewhat indirect , involving solvent molecular sizes",
    "also , the differences between the present choice of molecular surface and the connolly surface is not significant physically .",
    "this choice , and the connolly choice also , yields a molecular surface that is generally not a liapunov surface @xcite .",
    "that smoothness condition is an important feature of general abstract discussions of boundary element methods @xcite .",
    "the importance of the smoothness of the surface for general discussions can be exemplified by considering the case of the traditional dirichlet problem : solution of @xmath23 within a closed volume with @xmath24 specified on the boundary . if , for example , the boundary does not have a unique surface normal then discussions involving the normal derivative of @xmath25 on the boundary become vexed .",
    "the significance of this point for our applications can be discussed on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) .",
    "the homogeneous contribution @xmath15 is continuous , smooth , and differentiable away from sources and , on the assumption that no sources are located precisely on the surface , on the boundary of the molecular volume also . in order to isolate potential problems we can focus on the integral of eq .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) .",
    "we notice that the discontinuous function @xmath3 appearing in the denominator can be cancelled exactly and that the factor @xmath26 is expected on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) to be continuous and finite away from sources and thus on the boundary in our problem .",
    "[ in fact , we can typically arrange it to be non - negative .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) can be a natural basis of monte carlo calculations . ] if we agree not to require computation of the electric field precisely at points where no unique surface normal exists , then the only potential difficulty to consider is associated with the integrability of the surface dipole contribution to the electric potential at a point off the boundary at positions of the sources .",
    "but those contributions are clearly integrable and thus only a problem of practical difficulty .",
    "some points of note about eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) are : first , eq.([inteqb ] ) is simple to interpret physically .",
    "it says that the net electrostatic potential of a charge is composed of the potential due to polarization induced in the medium by electric fields there in addition to a direct , or bare interaction .",
    "second , for the conventional applications @xmath3 is a sharp step at the molecular surface and thus the integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) and ( [ inteqc ] ) are surface integrals over the molecular surface .",
    "although these equations are obviously twins , they offer different physical pictures of the problem .",
    "the integral of eq .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) describes a discontinuous function of @xmath27 ; that discontinuity is consistent with the obvious discontinuity of the left - side of eq.([inteqa ] ) .",
    "the integrand is a continuous function , however , for * r * not on the boundary . for *",
    "r * inside the molecular volume where @xmath28 , the integrand of eq .  ( [ inteqa ] ) can be viewed as the potential due to a dipolar surface density @xmath29 .",
    "the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ inteqc ] ) can be considered to be the potential due a surface charge density @xmath30 . for this case ,",
    "the integrand varies discontinuously with normal displacement through the molecular surface because the normal electric field is discontinuous at a sharp step in @xmath3 .",
    "if we evaluate that negative gradient normal to the molecular surface by assuming that it is half the sum of the inside and outside values , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ inteqc ] ) the equation that provides the basis for the most widely used of previous boundary element calculations .",
    "this is discussed in an appendix .",
    "( [ inteqc ] ) can be written more physically for the electric potential of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) as @xmath31 with the requirement that @xmath28 wherever @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the electric potential in the absense of the medium .    in constructing and analyzing practical solutions",
    "is it helpful to recognize simple applications of gauss s law , for example to eq .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is one or zero if the observation point @xmath36 is inside or outside , respectively , the molecular volume .",
    "all examples here used @xmath37 in the solvent .",
    "the quantities presented in these examples are the potentials of the mean forces obtained as @xmath38 u is the static energy of the solute in the absence of the solvent .",
    "typically , a constant contribution to @xmath39 is adjusted so that this potential of mean force is zero at some asymptotic separation of interest .",
    "the distribution of free charge @xmath40 is a sum of partial charges so the integral of eq .",
    "( [ pomf ] ) reduces to a sum over those charges .",
    "that is not an important limitation , clearly . except where noted , we used the same charge distribution employed in obtaining the simulation results used as a comparison .",
    "all our results below were obtained on the basis of either eqs .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) , or ( [ inteqc ] ) , or both , utilizing methods described subsequently .",
    "wherever possible we used the radii - parameters of ref .",
    "otherwise we adopted van der waals radii arbitrarily and will note those values in the specification of the example calculations .",
    "we note that knowledge of the helpful work ref .",
    "@xcite would probably have permitted better initial estimates of the required radii - parameters .",
    "however , we reiterate our expectation that variation of hydration free energies with geometry place a different demand on the dielectric model and upon radii - parameters than do total free energies or total free energy changes upon reaction .",
    "we expect that qualitative conclusions drawn below would not be changed by reasonable alterations of the radii - parameters used .",
    "energy units on the following graphs are either k@xmath41 t or kcal / mol .",
    "that choice was governed by the energy units chosen in reporting the original results that we are using for comparison .",
    "for all the results here k@xmath41",
    "t @xmath42kcal / mol and that smaller unit was typically adopted where more refined analyses were pursued .",
    "we note that practioners are not yet unanimous regarding the most appropriate boundary conditions to use for electrostatic interactions in simulation calculations of the sort we rely on here .",
    "different boundary condition choices can lead to quite different results .",
    "we have exercised some judgement in choosing simulation results to use . in some cases ,",
    "we have not used simulation results that are substantially the same as those we have used . in some other cases , however , we have excluded simulation results that display obvious dubious features , even though those features do not presently have a clear explanation .",
    "our results below are based upon solutions of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) that are believed to be accurate to about 0.3 k@xmath41 t for the total solvation free energy for the worst cases .",
    "the principal difficulty we have encountered is the following : numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) requires replacement of a continuous problem with a discrete one .",
    "the results of different calculations can change practically discretely @xcite unless special care is taken to avoid that and this is especially important for changes in geometry .",
    "for example , the position or number of lattice points can change discontinuously depending on the geometry and how the numerical problem is organized .",
    "such changes can be small on the scale of the total solvation free energy , _",
    "e.g. _ 0.5% of the whole , but large and puzzling on the scale of the potentials of mean force .",
    "none of those features are evident in our results below .",
    "thus , we believe our results presented here are the correct solution of the dielectric model for the problems considered . a major emphasis of the subsequent discussion of numerical methods is placed upon getting correct and correctly continuous variation of the free energy with geometry .",

    "we note that the xrism @xcite and the dielectric model calculations agree in properly describing the asymptotic @xmath46 behavior .",
    "all results show a contact minimum at about 2.6 - 2.8  .",
    "the repulsive , short - distance side of this contact minimum is due to the effect of the solvent in pulling the ion pair apart .",

    "[ nacl.fig ] shows that those differences in the molecular surfaces are important in the region of the free energy barrier .",
    "however , the close equality of those results near the contact minimum suggests that the differences in the molecular surfaces used are not important in that region of inter - ionic separations .",
    "on this basis , we restrict our conclusions here to the region of the contact minimum .",
    "we conclude that the dielectric models predict that contact - paired ions are too stable relative to the dissociation limit .",

    "note that all sample points , buried or not , on the surface of the sphere that supports plaque @xmath104 should be used in the estimation but whether any sample point resides within or without plaque @xmath104 depends on resolution of buried surface .",

    "the medium properties non - perturbatively reflect that fact . from the perspective of this molecular theory , the dielectric solvation model application neglects the zeroth and first order terms",

    "it is clear that the dielectric model is not satisfactorily accurate .",
    "but even then , it is a reasonable view that the failures of the model are due principally to failure in suitably describing the molecular volume rather than an essential failure of the perturbative formula eq .",
    "( [ perturb ] ) .    a direct implementation of eq .",

    "it is helpful to note some often mentioned alternatives for the molecular theory corresponding to this dielectric model .",
    "one alternative might be based upon the suggestion that a spatially local dielectric constant should be used . if a first solvation shell is structurally fixed and if a local dielectric constant is given to describe the polarization of that shell , then this is similar in spirit to the present model .",
    "however , more generally it must be admitted that a local dielectric constant is a ambiguous concept unless local means ` macroscopically local . '",
    "the macroscopic solution dielectric constant is unambiguous and the net polarization of the interior of a rigid molecular structure also is a simple physical concept .",
    "this level of modeling is therefore reasonable but we have refrained from extending the present model to elaborate those ideas in more difficult settings .    a second alternative is based upon the observation that on a molecular scale the dielectric response should be non - local .",
    "this non - local response would be characterized by a wave - vector dependent dielectric constant , @xmath165 .",
    "this is a much less ambiguous approach than the ` local dielectric constant ' idea mentioned above .",

    "this may be important because almost all simulations of macroscopic matter utilize periodic boundary conditions ; and many of those use the solution of poisson s equation in periodic boundary conditions , the ewald potential .",
    "we start by noting that the ewald potential could be constructed with a boundary integral method .",
    "this can be demonstrated in a classic fashion from green s second formula @xcite @xmath210 in the present notation .",
    "the integral on the right is over the surface of a unit cell of a bravais lattice , _",
    "e.g. _ , the surface of a cube .",
    "@xmath211 is the outward pointing normal .",
    "we exploit this in the traditional fashion with the traditional choice @xmath212 and @xmath213 . then @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "this gives the equation @xmath216 this notation assumes , and our argument depends on this construction , that the unit cell is centered on the source .",
    "this will not limit the generality of the result because we will use that device to construct the general periodic solution of interest . with this choice of origin",
    ", the ewald electric field normal to the surface must be zero .",
    "then @xmath217 thus , the ewald potential can be represented as the coulomb potential due to a charge distribution within the cell plus the coulomb potential due to a dipolar surface distribution .",
    "this equation might be used to determine the ewald potential by discretizing the surface , taking the position @xmath9 on the surface , and using eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) to determine @xmath218 on the surface .",
    "the periodic solution could then be constructed by periodic replication . however , this equation is properly deficient in one respect : it is ambiguous with respect to the addition of a spatial constant .",
    "thus if @xmath219 is a solution , so is @xmath220 .",
    "it is traditional @xcite and natural @xcite to chose this constant so that @xmath221    with this backdrop , we reconsider the dielectric problem .",
    "a relevant green s formula is now @xmath222 -g({\\bf r})\\nabla \\bullet \\left [ { \\varepsilon ( { \\bf r})\\nabla f({\\bf",
    "r } ) } \\right ] } \\right\\ } } \\nonumber\\\\ = \\int\\limits_{\\partial v } { d^2r\\,\\hat n\\bullet \\left\\ { { f({\\bf r})\\varepsilon ( { \\bf r})\\nabla g({\\bf r } ) -g({\\bf r})\\varepsilon ( { \\bf r})\\nabla f({\\bf r } ) } \\right\\ } } \\label{b5 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose @xmath223 the final point to make about this application of green s formulae is that in this case the surface contributions will vanish : @xmath224 the reason for this is that all functions in the integrand are triply - periodic .",
    "thus , the gradient at a surface point can always be matched against another with equal weight and opposite projection on the surface normal .",
    "the relations @xmath225 and @xmath226 then directly lead to      this should be compared to eq .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "now if we use the conventional ewald potential , then we have eq .  ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "further , if we use eq .",
    "( [ b8 ] ) _ without _ the penultimate contribution , then @xmath228 is a linear combination of just those conventional potentials . in that case , the neglected last term will be zero .",
    "our conclusion is that the form of the equation need not change in going from the unbounded to the ewald case provided we substitute the conventional ewald potential for coulomb s law .",
    "here we consider the formula eq .",
    "( [ fsa ] ) .",
    "our goal is to show how to use points sampled uniformly on the surface of a sphere to estimate the solid angle subtended by a plaque at the plaque point just outside the sphere .",
    "[ fsa.fig ] shows the geometry considered here .",
    "we take the z - axis through the plaque point with origin at the center of the sphere .",
    "the complication is that the solid angle required is referenced to the origin at the plaque point .",
    "the solid angle subtended just _ inside _ the plaque point is given by @xmath230 where @xmath231 is denotes the integration over the surface of a unit sphere centered at the plaque point and @xmath232 is the indicator function for the angles @xmath63 for which the unit vector @xmath233 points within the plaque .",
    "this integration can be implemented as @xmath234 in order to use sampling points uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere we need to reference the integration to the center of the sphere rather than the plaque point . in that change of angular",
    "coordinates the azimuthal angle @xmath235 is unchanged but the polar angle @xmath236 transforms as @xmath237 .",
    "\\label{c3}\\ ] ] the polar angle from the center of the sphere is @xmath238 .",
    "we then write @xmath239 this is in a form of an average : @xmath240 where we have used the transformation eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath241 indicates that the sampling points should be uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere .",
    "it can be checked that this formula produces the correct answer when the plaque covers the entire sphere .",
    "when the plaque is a circular cap centered at the plaque point this formula produces @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the polar angle at the perimeter of the circular cap .",
    "the use of the engineering estimate @xmath244 underlies the approximation eq .",
    "( [ ref - dmat ] ) .",
    "the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ c5 ] ) is integrable but singular .",
    "this difficulty can be relieved by considering the complementary indicator function @xmath245 and the complementary solid angle : @xmath246 but this complement is just the outside solid angle desired , @xmath247 . implementing this formula as a sampling estimate that uses the points uniformly distributed on the spherical area outside the plaque gives eq .",
