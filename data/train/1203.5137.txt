    "the experiments at the lhc have already delivered many interesting results related to the processes of the elastic scattering and multiparticle production ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "presence of the significant collective effects has been revealed in the inelastic @xmath1-interactions .",
    "those effects can be interpreted as a manifestation of the high degree coherence in the @xmath1-collisions resulting in the multiparticle final states @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the initial particles preserve their identity after the interaction in elastic scattering and in this sense the studies of the elastic scattering provide a complimentary relevant instrument .",
    "it can also lead to a new insight on the nature of the nonperturbative hadronic interactions , role of confinement and possible asymptotic mechanism of hadron scattering .",
    "the studies of the correlations of the large-@xmath0 elastic scattering alongside with the multiparticle production studies can bring a useful information on the hadron scattering at very high energies @xcite .",
    "these correlations can serve as an independent and additional qualitative experimental signatures of the possible asymptotic mechanism .",
    "the highest energy where differential cross - section of elastic scattering has been measured was @xmath2 tev @xcite .",
    "these measurements have demonstrated existence of the dip and smooth decreasing dependence on the transferred momentum in the region beyond the second maximum .",
    "similar smooth dependence with lower value of slope has been observed earlier in the wide @xmath0-region at the cern isr and at lower energies as well @xcite .",
    "low-@xmath0 region and dip structure are commonly associated with the diffraction on the opaque object .",
    "thus , in this region the main role is to be attributed to the nonperturbative collective dynamics .    in the region beyond the second maximum , additional dips and bumps",
    "are absent .",
    "such dependence is interpreted in different ways .",
    "it can be considered as a result of the composite hadron structure . in this case",
    "a power - like dependence @xcite is to be used as a relevant function for the description of the experimental data .",
    "contrary , the exponential form can also be applied .",
    "the above  mentioned dependencies imply different dynamical mechanisms , namely , power  like behavior corresponds to the composite scattering dynamics where coherence is absent and point  like constituents are independent , while the exponential form can be associated with coherent collective interactions persisting at large values of @xmath3 .    in this letter",
    "we discuss the issue of the coherence in the large-@xmath0 elastic scattering in the light of the new experimental data at @xmath2 tev and demonstrate that the available data are in better agreement with predictions based on the collective dynamics .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , the differential cross  section of elastic scattering has been measured at various values of @xmath3 at the lhc energy @xmath2 tev .",
    "the interest in the large-@xmath0 region is related to the possible detection of the point  like dynamics in the proton scattering @xcite .",
    "the dependence @xmath5 results from the perturbative qcd 3-gluon - exchange diagrams ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . from the theoretical point of view , this dependence and its apparent agreement with the experimental data imply dominance of the pinch singularities of the landshoff type independent  scattering diagrams despite a presence of the sudakov form factor @xcite in the elastic scattering in this region of the transferred momenta .",
    "the power - like parametrization @xmath6 was used for description of the experimental data in the region between 1.5 @xmath7 and 2.0 @xmath7 in the experimental paper @xcite and it corresponds to the @xmath8 dependence with account of the experimental errors .",
    "this dependence is depicted on the fig .",
    "1 ( dashed line ) .",
    "[ 78 ]    at the lhc energy @xmath2 tev eq .",
    "( [ 78 ] ) allows to fit data in the rather narrow region of the transferred momenta .",
    "note that the independent  scattering diagrams are not rotationally  invariant and therefore presence of the orbital momentum can lead to the specific spin effects in elastic scattering which can be used as a signature of the presence or absence of such contribution @xcite .",
    "vanishing of the helicity non - conserving dynamics with energy disagrees with the survival of the above mechanism .",
    "another dependence , of an exponential type , called orear behavior @xcite @xmath9 can also describe the experimental data with @xmath10 @xmath11 , cf . fig .",
    "1 ( solid line ) .",
    "this value of the slope parameter is about twice as much larger compared to the corresponding value of @xmath12 at the cern isr and at lower energies @xcite .",
    "it will be shown further that the energy dependence of the slope can result from the presence of phase in @xmath13matrx or double helicity - flip amplitudes contribution .",
    "it is evident that the exponential dependence on @xmath14 describes experimental data in the wider region of @xmath3-values and use of the power - like dependence for the data analysis seems to be premature and misleading .",
    "the measurements at @xmath15 @xmath16 would allow to clarify the experimental situation .    at the moment",
    "however , one can conclude that the coherent scattering is a dominating one in the region of the large @xmath3-values .",
    "it should be noted that the experimental data for elastic large - angle scattering at lower energies were analysed in @xcite and conclusion on the presence of substantial coherent  scattering effects even at large angles has been done .",
    "several dynamical mechanisms lead to the orear dependence but all of them have collective non - perturbative dynamics at the origin .",
    "such behavior can result from the presence of the poles of the scattering amplitude in the complex plane of the impact parameter .",
    "these moving regge - like poles in the direct channel of reaction appear in the tunneling picture of hadronic diffraction where they are related to the surface creep waves @xcite and match the concept of the geometrical picture where resonances are peripherally excited at the edge of the interaction region @xcite .",
    "the appearance of such poles can also be a result @xcite of the rational form of the scattering amplitude unitarization .",
    "such form of the amplitude unitarization might be related with the confinement phenomena @xcite . in this form of unitarization the elastic scattering @xmath17matrix element ( @xmath18 )",
    "can be written in the form @xmath19 in the case of pure imaginary @xmath13matrix ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "elastic scattering amplitude has the poles in the complex impact parameter plane whose position is determined by the solutions of the equation @xmath21 solutions of this equation depend weakly on the particular form of the function @xmath13 ( provided it has known analytical properties in the complex @xmath0-plane ) . ] : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the positive integer number and @xmath24 is the hadron interaction radius . in the case",
    "when the function @xmath13 has the phase @xmath25 the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath26 can be expanded over parameter @xmath27 in the following form : @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are the smooth functions of @xmath14 if the function @xmath30 is not identically equal to @xmath31 and oscillating ones in the case @xmath32 ( details can be found in @xcite ) . at large values of @xmath3 in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) one can keep only several or even one term and arrive to the orear dependence eq .",
    "( [ or ] ) in the expression for the expansion parameter @xmath33 can be related to the masses of the constituent quarks@xcite and parameter @xmath12 in eq.([or ] ) can aquire a nontrival energy dependence due to the phase @xmath30 . ] .",
    "thus , in the case of pure imaginary scattering amplitude the poles in the impact parameter plane provide additional oscillating factors in front of the exponential dependence in the amplitude .",
    "these oscillations are common for the diffraction picture with pure imaginary scattering amplitude .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the scattering amplitude at very high energies will tend to the pure imaginary function .",
    "therefore the absence of the oscillations in the region of large @xmath3 which can naturally be explained at lower energies by the significant role of the generalized reaction matrix phase would not work at the lhc energies .",
    "another explanation of the smooth dependence of the differential cross ",
    "section is the role of the spin effects associated with the presence of the essential double helicity - flip amplitude contribution @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the helicity  flip amplitudes can also be represented in the form of the expansion similar to eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) these helicity amplitudes ( there are five independent helicity amplitudes for @xmath1-scattering ) can be written in the form @xmath34,\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath35 are exponentially decreasing with @xmath14 .",
    "it has been shown that the double helicity ",
    "flip amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 are important at large values of @xmath3 and compensates oscillations of the helicity non - flip amplitudes @xcite .    however , again it is difficult to expect that any helicity - flip amplitudes would survive at such high energies as the lhc energies are .",
    "vanishing of the helicity - flip amplitudes would , therefore , result in appearance of the oscillations at higher @xmath3-values provided , of course , that the above spin mechanism is mainly responsible for the smooth large-@xmath0 dependence at lower energies .",
    "thus , a possible appearance of the above oscillations in the differential cross - section at higher values of @xmath3 should be interpreted then as an observation of the @xmath38-channel helicity conservation in @xmath1-scattering at the lhc energies .",
    "thus , we would like to emphasize that use of the power  like dependence for the description of the experimental data for the large@xmath0 elastic scattering at the lhc energy @xmath2 @xmath39 seems to be premature in the currently available for the experimental measurements region of the transferred momenta .",
    "there are theoretical and experimental arguments in favor of the expectation that the orear dependence ( with or without oscillating factors ) being more relevant for the descriprion of the elastic scattering in this kinematical region of large energy and transferred momentum values .",
    "we would like to note that the presence of the possible oscillations of the differential cross - section at higher values of @xmath3 can not be excluded on the current experimental basis as it was mentioned in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite provide also a list of references to the several quantitative models of elastic scattering not mentioned in the present note .",
    "we concentrated here on the qualitative dynamical implications of large-@xmath0 experimental data for @xmath1-elastic measured at the lhc energy @xmath2 tev .",
