    "observations of supernovae redshifts , cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the large - scale structure provide increasingly strong evidence that the late - time universe is accelerating .",

    "phantom \" scalar fields , with @xmath4 , have the same theoretical problems as quintessence , but in addition , classically they have the unphysical behaviour that the energy density increases with the expansion of the universe , and they also lead to instability of the quantum vacuum .    current data does not rule out a phantom value , @xmath4 .",

    "the standard dgp model is a self - accelerating model without any form of dark energy , and the effective @xmath5 is always non - phantom .",

    "the self - accelerating dgp model is the ( + ) branch .",
    "the dgp@xmath6 model is very different .",
    "it does not self - accelerate , but requires dark energy on the brane .",
    "it experiences 5d gravitational modifications to its dynamics , which effectively screen the dark energy . at late times , as gravity leaks off the 4d brane , the dynamics deviates from general relativity .",
