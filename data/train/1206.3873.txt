    "the low galactic latitude gamma - ray source known as 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939  is one of the entries in the recent large area telescope ( lat ) 2-year point source catalog provided by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope in the 100 mev to 100 gev energy range @xcite .",
    "the fermi team points out a preliminary classification as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of unknown type .",
    "this high - energy source is likely to have been detected as well by other observatory missions in the past in both x - rays and soft gamma - rays .",
    "the reader is referred to table [ conioya ] for an historical account .",
    "attempts to find out the nature of this object based on these lower energy detections have provided no conclusive result yet . in particular , inside the 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939  95% confidence ellipse there is only one conspicuous x - ray source , namely 1rxs j205644.3 + 494011 .",
    "up to very recently , the identification of this rosat source with the luminous star bd+49 3420 was still considered plausible instead of an extragalactic origin @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite proposed this x - ray emitter as a possible microquasar candidate pointing out its coincidence with an intense radio source .    in this work ,",
    "we address the new fermi detection together with all the multi - wavelength observational data available to try to shed light about the true origin of 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939 .     shown at the bottom right corner .",

    "radio imaging of high energy sources has proved to be an important tool to their understanding . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show a contour map of radio emission in the field of 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939  according to the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) . only the extended radio source nvss j205642 + 494005 is consistent even with the less accurate positions in table [ conioya ] reported by fermi , integral and beppo - sax . as the nvss has a poor angular resolution , we inspected the nrao data archives in search for interferometric observations with long baselines .",
    "we found only one observing run suitable for our purposes under project code ak0360 and carried out at the 6 cm wavelength on 1994 may 8th , with the very large array ( vla ) in its hybrid ab configuration .",
    "the data were retrieved and calibrated using the aips package of nrao .",
    "the source 3c286 was used for amplitude calibration , while the phase calibrator was the nearby source 2202 + 422 .",
    "finally , self - calibration was applied as the target source was bright enough .    as a result",
    ", we obtained the contour map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] revealing that the extended nvss source also exhibits compact emission components .",
    "this was achieved using a pure uniform weighting of the interferometer visibilities ( aips robust parameter @xmath0 ) , thus yielding a sub - arcsecond angular resolution .",
    "nvss j205642 + 494005 appears as partially resolved .",
    "an elliptical gaussian fit using the aips task jmfit gives a deconvolved angular size of @xmath1 mas@xmath2 , with a position angle of @xmath3 .",
    "the radio source is centered at the j2000.0 position @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with an estimated uncertainty of about @xmath6 in each coordinate .",
    "this is fully consistent with the most precise error circles of table [ conioya ] , as is also illustrated in fig .",
    "the field of view of this second figure zooms deeply on the central parts of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the most accurate error circles of table [ conioya ] are overlayed on it . the total integrated flux density of nvss j205642 + 494005 at 6 cm is @xmath7 mjy .",
    "although we can not accurately estimate the spectral index , consultation of the specfind v2.0 catalogue @xcite suggests that this object is a flat - spectrum radio source .    .",

    "2mass j20564271 + 4940068 / iphas j205642.74 + 494006.7 and all high energy error boxes listed in table [ conioya ] , strongly points to all being the same astronomical source .",
    "this is in addition the most peculiar object within the error ellipse of 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939 .",
    "the possible connection with this gamma - ray source is reinforced after running a monte carlo simulation ( see the methodology in @xcite ) to estimate the probability of a chance coincidence between the x - ray and the fermi sources , that turns out to be of the order of 0.4% .",
    "on the other hand , the bright star bd+49 3420 is clearly excluded as candidate counterpart due to its non positional coincidence with most x - ray detections .",
    "the data currently available are not able to clearly find out the nature , galactic or extragalactic , of the proposed counterpart to 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939 . nevertheless , a crude assessment is possible relying on broad band photometry .",
    "based on x - ray spectral fits , the total hydrogen column density towards it is estimated as about @xmath30 @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this number translates into a visual extinction of @xmath32 mag or , equivalently , a colour excess of @xmath33 . taking this into account , the deredened photometric colors of the iphas/2mass counterpart amount to : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "when checking against tables of intrinsic stellar colours ( e.g. @xcite ) , we find that the iphas colour lower limit would be consistent with a main sequence star later than a2v .",
    "however , the infrared colours can not be easily matched with any kind of normal star .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of this source does not resemble to be stellar and the possibility of being an extragalactic object is thus reinforced .",
    "if this is the case , the point - like appearance of the optical / infrared counterpart would be typical of a distant agn ( possibly a quasar or a blazar ) . in this case",
    ", the observed flat radio spectrum could be naturally interpreted in terms of self - absorption of synchrotron radio photons in the compact core .",
    "there exists another outstanding radio source inside the error circle of 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939  as may be seen in fig .",
    "its extended appearance at 20 cm wavelength suggests a possible one - sided jet structure .",
    "the 1994 vla archival data used in this paper clearly detect the position of a compact core consistent with nvss j205629.93 + 493756.4 .",
    "its precise j2000.0 coordinates are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with an estimated uncertainty of about @xmath40 with a measured 6 cm flux density of @xmath41 mjy . in addition",
    ", the spectral index seems to be non - thermal according to @xcite .",
    "however , despite all these facts the identification of this nvss source with 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939  seems much less likely than for the nvss j205642 + 494005 .",
    "the key reason is the absence of any hints of x - ray emission which one would normally expect as a by - product in the context of common physical scenarios with production of gamma - rays .    to conclude , we have reported new radio and optical observations at sub - arcsecond scales towards the recently detected fermi source 2fgl  j2056.7 + 4939 . together with archival data at x - ray wavelengths , we propose that the 2mass j20564271 + 4940068/iphas j205642.74 + 494006.7 is the most plausible candidate counterpart of this gamma - ray source instead of the luminous star bd+49 3420 , as sometimes still quoted in the literature .",
    "further optical / infrared spectroscopic observations would be required to find the true nature of this object , although current evidence suggests that an extragalactic scenario is a likely one .",
