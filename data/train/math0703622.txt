    "let @xmath2 be a minimal immersion of a compact surface with genus @xmath3 into an @xmath4-dimensional flat torus which does not lie in any subtorus of @xmath5 ( it can be replaced by an @xmath4-periodic minimal immersion from some covering space of @xmath6 into @xmath7 ) .",
    "the conformal structure induced by the isothermal coordinates makes @xmath6 a riemann surface and @xmath8 is called a conformal minimal immersion . before we refer to the back grounds , we state the following result ( p.884 @xcite ) :    @xmath9    if @xmath10 is a conformal minimal immersion then , after a translation , @xmath8 can be represented by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a fixed point in @xmath6 , superscript @xmath13 means the transposed matrix , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are holomorphic differentials on @xmath6 satisfying @xmath18 conversely , if @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 are holomorphic differentials satisfying @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , then @xmath8 , defined as above , is a conformal minimal immersion",
    ".    condition ( 3 ) is called the period condition and guarantees the well - definedness of the path integral .    using the notations as above , we define the associate surface @xmath23 : @xmath24 in particular",
    ", the associate surface @xmath25 is called the conjugate surface .",
    "we note that @xmath23 may not be well - defined for any torus , even though @xmath26 is well - defined on @xmath6 .",
    "recall that the gauss map @xmath27 is given as a holomorphic map from @xmath6 to the quadric @xmath28 \\in \\textbf{c}p^{n-1 } | \\sum_{k=1}^n ( w_k)^2 = 0 \\}$ ] : @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one of the beautiful classical theorems on compact riemann surfaces states that every compact riemann surface of positive genus is holomorphically embedded in the jacobian by the abel - jacobi map : take a basis @xmath30 of the space of holomorphic differentials of @xmath6 , and consider @xmath31 the jacobian @xmath32 is the complex torus represented by @xmath33 and the holomorphic embedding @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 is called the abel - jacobi map .",
    "the jacobian satisfies the following universal property ( p.5 @xcite ) :    @xmath9    given @xmath2 a conformal minimal immersion , we may assume @xmath36 .",
    "then there exists a real homomorphism @xmath37 from @xmath32 to @xmath5 so that @xmath38 :    ( 300,45 ) ( 80,-7)(1,0)170 ( 50,-10)@xmath6 ( 270,-10)@xmath5 ( 150,40)jac@xmath39 ( 70,0)(2,1)70 ( 200,35)(2,-1)70 ( 100,25)@xmath40 ( 230,25)@xmath41 ( 165,-18)@xmath8 ( 165,15)@xmath42     +    the abel - jacobi map plays an important role in the theory of algebraic curves ( e.g. torelli s theorem , schottoky problem , etc . ) and so , by theorem 1.2 , it is useful to study minimal surfaces from the point of view of the theory of algebraic curves .",
    "in fact , ejiri @xcite has translated schottoky problem into a differential geometric situation and has studied the moduli space of compact minimal surfaces in flat tori .",
    "algebraic curves can be divided into non - hyperelliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves , and in particular , there is a topological obstruction to hyperelliptic minimal surfaces in @xmath0-dimensional flat tori .",
    "actually , a hyperelliptic minimal surface of even genus can not be minimally immersed into any @xmath0-dimensional flat torus ( theorem 3.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that every compact riemann surface can be represented as a branched @xmath43-cover of the sphere for some @xmath44 , and it is reasonable to ask whether there is a topological obstruction or not for @xmath45 ( a riemann surface with @xmath46 is a hyperelliptic curve , and hence we omit the case @xmath46 ) .",
    "now we consider this problem for @xmath47 . recall that a non - hyperelliptic curve with @xmath47 is called a trigonal curve .",
    "our first result is the following topological obstruction :    @xmath9    let @xmath48 be a conformal minimal immersion of a trigonal riemann surface @xmath6 with genus @xmath3 .",
    "then , @xmath49 holds for some @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , a trigonal riemann surface of genus @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( mod @xmath0 ) can not be minimally immersed into any @xmath0-dimensional flat torus .",
    "@xmath9    there are some examples of trigonal minimal surfaces in @xmath0-dimensional flat tori : ( i ) a previous example @xcite ( @xmath53 ) , ( ii ) schoen s i - wp surface @xcite , @xcite ( @xmath54 ) , where @xmath55 is given in main theorem 1 .",
    "next , we consider the higher codimensional case . in 1976 , nagano - smyth @xcite constructed compact minimal surfaces in @xmath4-dimensional flat tori abstractly . on the other hand , there are few explicit examples , and thus we will construct an example of trigonal minimal surfaces in the simplest case , that is , in case @xmath56 . actually , an example of trigonal minimal surfaces of genus @xmath57 in @xmath58-dimensional flat tori is given ( see 3.2 ) .",
    "in general , the most difficult part in constructing examples comes from the period condition .",
    "it is not always possible to solve the period condition , and we can not even calculate the periods .",
    "we overcome this problem through the following process : ( i ) taking a suitable riemann surface and considering its symmetries ( see 3.1 ) , ( ii ) calculating the periods by the functional theoretical techniques ( see lemma 3.1 ) , and ( iii ) finding a relation between one period and another one ( see lemma 3.2 ) .",
    "now , we consider our example in view of nagano - smyth s discussion @xcite .",
    "in fact , this example satisfies the following properties : ( a ) the conjugate surface @xmath59 is well - defined , ( b ) the associate surfaces @xmath60 are also well - defined for a countable dense set of angles @xmath61 , ( c ) this example is homologous to @xmath51 in the @xmath58-torus .",
    "@xmath9    arezzo - pirola showed the existence of minimal surfaces which are not homologous to @xmath51 in the tori .    here , we review the nagano - smyth s argument .",
    "let @xmath62 be a subgroup of the automorphism group of @xmath6 , and say @xmath8 has symmetry @xmath62 if and only if @xmath62 extends under @xmath8 to a group of affine transformations of @xmath5 .",
    "when the corresponding linear representation of @xmath62 is irreducible , we say @xmath8 has irreducible symmetry @xmath62 .",
    "if the complexification of this representation is also irreducible , then we say @xmath8 has absolutely irreducible symmetry @xmath62 .",
    "nagano - smyth showed that ( i ) if @xmath8 has absolutely irreducible symmetry , then @xmath8 satisfies ( c ) ( theorem 2 in @xcite ) , ( ii ) if we assume the above irreducible conditions by weyl group and some conditions , then @xmath8 satisfies ( a ) and ( b ) ( theorem 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , our example satisfies ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and has only reducible symmetry ( see section 3 ) .",
    "therefore , the converse propositions of nagano - smyth s results do not hold respectively .",
    "finally , we state the above results as follows :    @xmath9    there exists a trigonal minimal surface of genus @xmath57 in a @xmath58-dimensional flat torus satisfying the following properties : ( i ) the conjugate surface @xmath59 is well - defined , ( ii ) the associate surfaces @xmath63 are well - defined for a countable dense set of angles @xmath61 , ( iii ) this surface is homologous to @xmath51 in the torus and has only reducible symmetry .",
    "in this section , we prove main theorem 1 .",
    "first , we review the spinor representation of minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "let @xmath64 be a conformal minimal immersion defined by @xmath65 .",
    "then , the gauss map @xmath27 commutes the following diagram :    ( 300,50 ) ( 90,33)(1,0)150 ( 70,30)@xmath6 ( 245,30)@xmath66 ( 155,-10)@xmath67 ( 90,25)(2,-1)60 ( 195,8)@xmath68 ( 180,-5)(2,1)60 ( 105,5)@xmath69 ( 220,5)@xmath70 ( 160,40)@xmath27 ( 160,12)@xmath42    @xmath9 +   + where @xmath70 is the veronese embedding given by @xmath71 let @xmath72 be the hyperplane bundle on @xmath73 and @xmath74 its pull - back to @xmath6 . note that @xmath75 is the canonical bundle @xmath76 of @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath77 defines a spin structure on @xmath6 .",
    "besides , again by pull - back , we find two holomorphic sections @xmath78 , @xmath79 of @xmath77 which have no common zeros such that @xmath80 the meromorphic function @xmath81 can be identified with the usual gauss map @xmath82 ( see @xcite ) .    next , we give some notations for a linear series ( or system ) .",
    "the standard terminology is as in @xcite . given a divisor @xmath83 on @xmath6 , the complete linear series @xmath84 is the set of effective divisors linearly equivalent to @xmath83 .",
    "we then have an identification between @xmath84 and projectivization of the space of holomorphic sections of the line bundle defined by @xmath83 : @xmath85 , and thus a complete linear series is a projective space .",
    "more generally , every linear subspace of a complete linear series is called a linear series . a linear series @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a vector subspace of @xmath84 ,",
    "is said to be a @xmath88 if and only if @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "a @xmath91 is called a pencil , a @xmath92 a net , and a @xmath93 a web .",
    "we write @xmath94 ( resp .",
    "@xmath95 ) for the complete linear series @xmath96 ( resp .",
    "@xmath97 ) , where @xmath98 . by a base point of a linear series @xmath86 , we mean a point common to all divisors of @xmath86 .",
    "if there are none , then we say that the linear series is base - point - free .    using the aboves , we prove main theorem 1 as follows :    @xmath9    we first observe that the degree of the gauss map is @xmath99 ( theorem 3.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath6 is not trigonal in case @xmath100 , and hence @xmath101 holds .",
    "we may omit the case @xmath102 because it corresponds to the case @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath6 is trigonal if and only if there is a base - point - free pencil @xmath103 on @xmath6 . in case @xmath104 ,",
    "the @xmath103 on @xmath6 is unique complete linear series ( p.124 @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath77 be the spin bundle given by the spinor representation of @xmath8 and @xmath105 the divisor defined by @xmath77 .",
    "note that ( 1 ) in theorem 1.1 implies that @xmath106 is base - point - free complete linear series .",
    "it is known that every base - point - free complete linear series @xmath88 is represented by @xmath107 where f is an effective divisor and consists of the base points of @xmath95 ( remark 1.2 in @xcite , ( 1.2.7 ) in @xcite ) . applying the above fact to @xmath106 ( @xmath108 ) , we obtain @xmath109 for some @xmath110 . in particular",
    ", @xmath111 follows and the proof is complete .",
    "in this section , we prove main theorem 2 through the following four subsections . in 3.1 , we explain how to determine our example . in 3.2 ,",
    "we calculate periods of the surface and solve the period condition directly .",
    "moreover , we consider the conjugate surface and the associate surfaces . in 3.3",
    ", we prove that the surface is homologous to @xmath51 in the torus .",
    "finally , we show that the surface has only reducible symmetry in 3.4 .",
    "+        in @xcite , we constructed a trigonal minimal surface defined by @xmath112 .",
    "we now consider the higher genus version of it .",
    "let @xmath6 be the cyclic covering of a line ( p.73 @xcite ) given by @xmath113 then , we can compute explicitly a basis for the space of holomorphic differentials @xmath114 : @xmath115 note that @xmath6 is not well - defined in case @xmath116 because riemann - hurwitz s formula does not hold , and @xmath6 has cusp singularity at @xmath117 in case @xmath118 .",
    "we make a choice the simplest case , that is , the case @xmath49 as above .",
    "the author found a component of the moduli space which is corresponding to trigonal minimal surfaces in @xmath58-tori @xcite .",
    "the minimal immersion @xmath8 defined as above is an element of the component of the moduli space .        in case @xmath125",

    "we use @xmath128 to calculate periods , and we can not solve the period condition if @xmath126 is too complicated .",
    "so , the period condition may not be solved in case @xmath129 .",
    "these suggest that @xmath130 may be the best case to construct examples explicitly .      in the next subsection",
    ", we prove the well - definedness of the following conformal minimal immersion of @xmath132 into @xmath119 : @xmath137 where @xmath120 is given by the beta function b(a , b ) : @xmath138{2}}\\,b(2/3,1/6 ) , \\\\",
