    "weinberg @xcite has recently reemphasized the importance of treating all four of these chiral sectors in a global context .",
    "it is by now legend that the su(2 ) linear sigma model ( lsm ) of gell - mann and levy @xcite , with elementary nucleons , sigma and pion fields , is the prototype field theory characterizing spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . likewise",
    "the four - fermion ( quark ) field theory of nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl @xcite ) , generating the chiral - limiting ( cl ) bound state @xmath22 meson masses , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the quark mass , is the classic example of dynamically broken chiral symmetry .",
    "these two field theories appear to be different in as much as the nucleon level lsm does not constrain the scalar mass @xmath25 as does eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) , although the masslessness of the goldstone field @xmath2 is certainly preserved in both cases .",
    "however , if one formulates the su(2 ) lsm _ at the quark level _ , it has been suggested @xcite that with spontaneous breaking the theory may be identical to the dynamically broken njl model , for @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , the one - loop order lsm not only recovers ( [ one ] ) , but it also leads to many more low - energy theorems @xcite , known to hold in tree order @xcite . notwithstanding the above successes , a spontaneously broken lsm still appears fundamentally different from the dynamically broken njl theory , especially in its _ effective description _ of low - energy qcd .    in this paper , in sections  [ sec : two ] and  [ sec : three ] , we will dynamically generate the lsm at the quark level in the spirit of njl . unlike others @xcite this will be done in the self - consistent sense that _ bare masses and expectation values vanish _ , @xmath26 signifying that the dynamically induced quantities @xmath24 and @xmath27 obey @xmath28",

    "of course the goldstone pion @xcite remains massless and the goldberger - treiman ( gt ) relation must hold at the quark level , @xmath36 to ensure axial current conservation .",

    "1b , the condition @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) yields @xcite , @xmath46 however it is dangerous to introduce an ultraviolet cut - off in a _ quadratically _ divergent graph since this depends sensitively on shift of origin ; in fact attempting to do so above produces an imaginary @xmath39 .",
    "moreover since @xmath24 does not appear in our initial cqm lagrangian  ( [ two ] ) , one could shift the @xmath1 field to @xmath47 so that  ( [ two ] ) acquires a chiral - broken kinetic part @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",

    "the only point of note is that the cubic couplings have been derived in a bootstrapped manner in as much as `` loops reproduce trees '' .",
    "these bootstrap concepts have a direct affinity with renormalization conditions @xcite @xmath72 appropriate to particles which are not elementary , but bound states of more basic fields .",

    "the feynman graphs of fig .",

    "collecting our various results , we have established that with the non - perturbative generation of the quark mass and pion decay constant , connected by @xmath77 , there are induced dynamically the meson masses @xmath78 and the meson interactions @xmath79 for @xmath80 , together with the original meson - quark interaction @xmath81 with @xmath82 this is identical in form with the model of gell - mann - levy , except that now the mass of the scalar meson is dynamically fixed to the njl value in ( [ one ] ) and the strong coupling for @xmath8 is also fixed to be @xmath83 which is compatible with the ratio @xmath84 , arising from the gt relation .",
    "alternatively , making use of the experimental @xmath85 in @xmath86 and @xcite @xmath87 , we may estimate @xmath88 .",
    "the mass values also make good sense since the cl constituent quark mass is dynamically fixed to be @xmath89 mev , as might be expected for a constituent quark .",
    "lastly , the njl @xmath1 mass is @xmath90 mev in the chiral limit , not incompatible with observational signals @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the impressive self - consistency of the scheme , we have one final constraint to consider : because we have worked around the true vacuum , we must verify that the chiral - symmetric vacuum expectation values are satisfied .",
    "this means that we must check lee s @xcite null tadpole condition , taking into account the induced meson interactions .",
    "evaluating the graphs of fig .",
    "6 , in the language of dimensional regularization , we must verify that @xcite the tadpole _",
    "sum _ vanishes : @xmath91 the first and third integrals in ( [ sixteen ] ) scale respectively to @xmath92 and @xmath61 and",
    "of course we discard the massless tadpole in dimensional regularization .",
    "hence we find as @xmath93 that a cancellation of the pole terms will occur providing @xmath94 curiously , this seems to require that there be three colours , @xmath8 for two flavours .",
    "this conclusion parallels the chiral anomaly @xcite prediction of the @xmath95 quark loop amplitude in the chiral limit @xcite , @xmath96 which leads to a decay rate ( for 3 colours and 2 flavours ) of @xmath97 quite close @xcite to the measured value of @xmath98 ev .",
    "note that using a quark loop , rather than a nucleon loop @xcite , the successful rate ( [ nineteen ] ) can also be regarded as an lsm prediction .",
    "stated another way , in the cqm field theory , the njl relation @xmath69 is initially generated via the quark mass gap of figure 1b .",
    "however the consequent @xmath72 vertex condition helps to induce dynamically the linear sigma model field theory , starting with ( 2 ) . at that level one obtains a vacuum expectation value for the full @xmath1 field ( not the bare @xmath99 ) as @xmath100 .",
    "one then shifts to @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "this corresponds to adding `` zero '' 3-point terms to the lagrangian ( 2 ) of the type @xmath103 with compositeness condition @xmath104 .",
    "one thereby obtains the renormalized lagrangian , @xmath105 where the dots refer to `` zero '' 4-point lagrangian terms . as usual",
    "one determines the vertex renormalization constant @xmath106 by evaluating the perturbative sum of 3-point plus quark loop graphs and thus recovers eqns .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) upon setting @xmath104 .",
    "note that the above renormalized cqm lagrangian `` knows '' about the meson terms such as the trilinear ones .",
    "if instead we dynamically induce the entire linear sigma model , then the quark mass gap graph of fig .",
    "1b must be supplemented by @xmath101- and @xmath2- mediated quark self - energies and also @xmath101 and @xmath30 tadpole graphs , which then all sum to zero . in this scenario",
    "the njl mass relation @xmath69 is a consequence of the lee constraint @xmath107 , or eqns .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "then because  ( [ eighteen ] ) empirically fixes @xmath8 , one sees from  ( [ seventeen ] ) that the njl mass relation follows .",
    "thus far we have consistently adopted only one regularization scheme , dimensional regularization .",
    "nevertheless a cutoff version of ( [ four ] ) would replace the right - hand side ( rhs ) by @xmath108 setting the latter to unity in turn suggests @xmath109 or @xmath110 mev for @xmath89 mev .",
    "this cutoff sensibly separates the elementary quarks and mesons from the known higher - mass @xmath22 su(2 ) bound states at @xmath111 , etc .    a few concluding remarks are called for .",
    "it is also possible to construct an effective lsm potential following the method of of coleman and weinberg @xcitebut that scheme does not require the conditions    @xmath69 or @xmath112 , although we should mention that a combined lsm - njl picture @xcite has recently been linked to low- energy qcd .",
    "we now make the chiral quark model ( cqm ) lagrangian ( [ two ] ) invariant under _ local _",

    "<S> the fermion and meson sectors of the quark - level su(2 ) linear sigma model are dynamically generated from a meson - quark lagrangian , with the quark ( @xmath0 ) and meson ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) fields all treated as elementary , having neither bare masses nor expectation values . in the chiral limit , the masses are predicted to be @xmath3 , and we also find that the quark - meson coupling is @xmath4 , the three - meson coupling is @xmath5 and the four - meson coupling is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 mev is the pion decay constant and @xmath8 is the colour number . by gauging this model one can generate the couplings to the vector mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , including the quark - vector coupling constant @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the masses @xmath14 mev , @xmath15 ; of course the vector and axial currents remain conserved throughout .    </S>"
