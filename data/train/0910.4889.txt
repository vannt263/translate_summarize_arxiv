    "the concept of path - width and tree - width were defined and played central role in the graph minors project by robertson and seymour . one important feature of path - width and the first result of this type is that excluding a tree in an infinite sequence of finite graphs results in a class of bounded path - width @xcite .",
    "similarly , a forbidden planar graph implies that the class has bounded tree - width @xcite .",
    "these results are complemented with the theorem that graphs of bounded tree - width are well - quasi - ordered @xcite giving a prototype of the deep and lengthy graph minor theorem .",
    "the proof for bounded tree - width is comprehensible and now well digested .",
    "this is one of the reasons that path - width is sometimes considered too simple or less valuable .",
    "since bounded tree - width implies bounded path - width , there is no direct proof that the graphs of bounded path - width are well - quasi - ordered .",
    "if path - width is `` so simple '' , then there should be a nash - williams type proof for this latter result @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that such a result is still unknown .",
    "another dogma we would like to attack is that graphs of large path - width are more important than that of small path - width .",
    "our point is that raising the connectivity and path - width simultaneously gives structural information .",
    "this idea has also been exploited in @xcite for algorithmic use .",
    "the number of excluded minors of this kind seems to increase mildly opposite to the number of excluded trees , which grows super - exponentially @xcite .",
    "we consider finite , simple graphs except in section  [ 2elof ] , where allowing double edges makes the list of excluded minors more compact .",
    "a graph @xmath1 is a _ minor of a graph @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath3 , if @xmath1 can be obtained from a subgraph of @xmath2 by contracting edges .",
    "contraction of an edge might lead to double edges .",
    "when we consider 2-edge - connected graphs , it is natural to allow double edges .",
    "it will make our discussion more comfortable .",
    "otherwise , we keep the graph simple by removing multiple edges after contraction . _    in this paper , we focus on the following well - known graph parameter .    a path - decomposition of a graph @xmath2 is a pair @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a path , and @xmath6 is a family of subsets of @xmath7 , satisfying + @xmath8 @xmath9 , and every edge of @xmath2 has both ends in some @xmath10 , and + @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 lies on the path from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , then @xmath16 .",
    "the width of a path - decomposition is @xmath17 , and the path - width of @xmath2 is the minimum width of all path - decompositions of @xmath2 .",
