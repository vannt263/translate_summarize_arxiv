    "up to 8000 ] we took a constant value of @xmath170 , and the increasing step for @xmath77 was proportional to the part of @xmath74 not being covered ( the proportional constant found by fine - tuning ) .",
    "besides its computational influence in our implementation , the smallest @xmath25 such that @xmath3 is @xmath25-smooth euclidean can also be interpreted as a measure of how far is @xmath3 from being euclidean .",
