    "galaxies in the local universe can be organized in a sequence of morphologies ( e.g. the hubble sequence ) which must be the result of the specific processes having originated them . yet",
    ", the relative roles over cosmic time of processes such as merging of dark matter halos , dissipation , starburst , feedback , agn activity , etc . remain largely conjectural , in particular concerning the establishment of the galaxy morphological differentiation",
    ". therefore , morphological analyses of faint high - z galaxies and studies of the evolution of galaxy sizes with cosmic time give an important insight on how the matter aggregated into the structures that we see today .",
    "the combination of a morphological investigation for flux limited samples of faint galaxies with complete redshift information provides decisive constraints on the formation epoch and the pattern for the galaxy build - up .    while in the local universe approximately 65% of all galaxies are spirals , 32% are ellipticals and 4% irregulars / peculiars ( marzke et al .",
    "1998 ) , there are indications that in the distant universe the irregular / peculiar fraction becomes predominant ( i.e. glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 , abraham 1996 ) .",
    "van den bergh et al . ( 2000 , 2001 ) concluded that most of the galaxies with @xmath6 can be hardly classified within the hubble scheme : irregular / peculiar / merging objects become more common beyond @xmath7 , spiral structures at @xmath8 are more chaotic than locally and spirals and ellipticals become extremely rare at @xmath9 .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reached similar conclusions , adding that at @xmath10 over 80% of the stellar mass is stored in peculiar galaxies .",
    "exploiting the same data set used in this work cimatti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated the morphology of the k20/cdfs eros , finding that only the @xmath11 of these objects were early - type galaxies .",
    "as a continuation of the k20 survey , daddi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) identified 9 actively star - forming / merging galaxies in the k20/goods field with @xmath12 and stellar mass @xmath13 , while cimatti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found over the same field 4 passive , early - type galaxies with @xmath14 with similar stellar masses .",
    "thus , while at @xmath15 most so massive galaxies are elliptical / s0 galaxies , by @xmath16 starburst and passive galaxies appear to be in nearly equal numbers .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of galaxy formation predict that dark matter halos formed by the merging of smaller units in the past .",
    "thus , the evolution of the merging fraction with redshift gives also important cosmogonic information ( see for a review abraham 1998 ) .",
    "several studies report an increasing merging fraction with redshift , both at moderate ( @xmath17 , patton et al .",
    "1997 ) , and at higher redshifts ( le fvre et al .",
    "2000 , by pair counts ; conselice et al .",
    "2003 , by the asymmetry measurements ) .",
    "however , in order to study the evolution with redshift of galaxy morphologies and sizes , the dependence of morphological properties on the wave - band and the effects of the changing rest - frame wavelength as a function of redshift ( the so - called morphological @xmath18-correction ) have to be taken into account .",
    "galaxies observed in their blue rest - frame appear with later - type morphologies than observed in the red part of the spectrum ( e.g. windhorst et .",
    "al 2002 ; papovich et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the problem of quantifying morphological properties of high redshift galaxies is still quite open . in the literature , parametric and non - parametric methods",
    "are usually applied . the former attempt to model the light distributions with a combination of analytic laws , like de vaucouleurs or exponential profiles , or the srsic model ( galfit , peng et al .",
    "2002 and gim2d , simard et al .",
    "various parameters ( i.e. bulge / disk b / d ratios or srsic indices ) are then derived , which are known to correlate with qualitative hubble classifications .",
    "this approach suffers however a number of problems .",
    "it needs to assume that the galaxy light distribution is well reproduced by a symmetric profile , hence is not suitable to treat merging structures , spiral arms , dust lanes and so on",
    ". moreover , there are degeneracies in the solutions for multi - component fits ( e.g. needed to retrieve the b / d ratio ) , because of the large number of free parameters .",
    "this becomes quickly unmanageable at decreasing galaxy brightness and number of galaxy pixels .",
    "an often used representation of galaxy morphological types is the parameter @xmath19 associated to the srsic profile @xmath20 , with some clear advantages over multi - component fits ( pignatelli et al .",
    "2004 ) . unfortunately , there are even local ellipticals with a roughly exponential profile , while only the most luminous and massive objects have @xmath21 ( i.e. caon et al .",
    "this obviously implies an intrinsic level of degeneracy .",
    "alternatively , non - parametric approaches to quantitative morphology have been developed in the last few years by several authors .",
    "the most used ones are the concentration ( c ) parameter ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 ) , that roughly correlates with the srsic index and with the b / d ratio , and the asymmetry ( a ) parameter ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 , conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) , able in principle to distinguish irregulars or mergers from more symmetric galaxies ( e / s0/sa ) .",
    "more recently another parameter has been introduced , the clumpiness ( s ) , measuring the degree of `` patchiness '' of a galaxy ( i.e. the light in the high spatial frequencies ) .",
    "the clumpiness is expected to correlate with the star - formation rate ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the advantage of the non - parametric approach is that no a - priory assumption is made about the distribution of light .",
    "some problems however still remain , like the influence of the noise on the asymmetry and clumpiness measures , or the choice of the spatial scale used to compute clumpiness , that must be adapted to the distance and the size of the object , or again the choice of the center of rotation for the computation of the asymmetry .",
    "one aspect that must be taken in consideration when dealing with a morphological analysis is the degree of human interaction needed to obtain the fitting parameters , both for non - parametric and for parametric procedures , in particular when treating large amounts of data , as those made available by the new advanced camera for surveys on hst ( e.g. the goods , cosmos , udf survey projects to mention a few ) .",
    "the galfit tool ( peng et al . 2002 ) , for example , has the advantage to allow masking out bad - pixel zones of the image ( e.g. dust lanes or spiral arms ) , in order to improve the fit .",
    "however , this appears unfeasible object by object over very large samples .",
    "gasphot , an automated tool recently developed by pignatelli , fasano and cassata ( 2004 ) , fitting the galaxy light - profile with a srsic model , has been instead defined to retrieve in fully automatic mode fundamental photometric and morphological parameters ( magnitudes , radii , axial ratios , srsic indices ) for all the objects in a given image .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the very deep high resolution imaging recently obtained over the cdfs area with acs / hst taken in the goods / hst treasury program ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) to make a careful morphological study of galaxies in the k20 sample within this area .",
    "in particular , we have exploited the multi - band coverage provided by hst and the redshift information available for each object to minimize the effects of morphological @xmath18-correction : we have studied each object in the acs band closer to the b - band rest - frame .",
    "we also take advantage of the k - band selection , that collects the light from low - mass stars dominating the baryonic content of galaxies , and thus providing a better mass completeness level .",
    "the k - band also allows to minimize the effects of the spectral @xmath18-correction , dust absorption , and evolution .",
    "we are particularly motivated to such an extensive analysis by the excellent optical spectroscopic follow - up obtained for this sample with the eso very large telescope in the last several years .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of galaxy morphologies and sizes as a function of redshift .",

    "we will use only the results obtained by the visual inspection , reinforced by those from automatic procedures .",
    "however , we are also interested in identifying a completely automatic procedure able to segregate at least early- from late - type galaxies with a low level of interaction . this procedure will be useful for the incoming new very large and deep surveys like goods and cosmos .",
    "the galaxies have been separated into five morphological classes ( see fig.[mor_ex ] ) : 1 . early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and s0 ) ; 2 .",
    "peculiar early - types , that is either spheroidals objects showing some amount of isophotal asymmetry , or galaxy pairs in which the main component is clearly elliptical ; 3 .",

    "irregular galaxies , that is objects with a high degree of asymmetry showing no evidence for a disk component .",
    "figure [ mor_ex ] illustrates some galaxies extracted from the 5 morphological classes .",
    "the visual inspection has been performed independently by three authors , pc , gr and gf , in order to minimize systematic trends . for the cases",
    "on which the classifications did not match , we have chosen the median morphological value .",
    "eventually , we have assigned 60 objects to class 1 , 14 to class 2 , 80 to class 3 , 48 to class 4 and 98 to class 5 .",
    "the classes with peculiar disks and irregular galaxies are the most populated ( @xmath42 of the galaxies fall in class 4 or 5 ) .",
    "it was not possible to systematically separate ellipticals from s0 , given the reduced isophotal area covered by the sources . among the 46 galaxies belonging to the above mentioned clusters , 20 are normal ellipticals , 3 are peculiar ellipticals , 10 are normal spirals , 5 are peculiar spirals and 8 are irregulars .",
    "we analyze here the effects of @xmath18-correction on the morphological classification of objects having @xmath38 .",
    "the reddest acs available band ( the f850lp filter ) does not match for these galaxies the b - band rest - frame , that is used for the morphological analysis of the remaining objects at lower z , but rather matches the u - band rest - frame .",
    "to this end we have selected a subsample of galaxies with @xmath44 , and we have compared their morphologies in the v ( 6060  , corresponding to the u - band rest - frame ) and @xmath4 ( 8500  , corresponding to the b - band rest - frame ) acs bands . in particular , 3 elliptical / s0 galaxies ( @xmath45 in fig .",

    ".    _ ellipticals . _",
    "the galaxies in panel 1 and 3 have a clear elliptical morphology both in u as in b rest - frame .",
    "the galaxy in panel 2 represents a border case : according to its b rest - frame image has been classified as s0 and assigned to class 2 ; it must be noted that this is the only case in which the classifiers have been able to distinguish s0 from e or sa morphologies . in the u rest - frame",
    "the s0 morphology is roughly preserved , tending perhaps to resemble to a sa spiral .    _",
    "normal spirals . _",
    "the galaxies in the panels 4 , 5 and 6 have been classified as normal spirals according to the presence in their b - band rest - frame images of a central bulge on top of a spiral - dominated disk .",
    "it turns out that for the objects in panel 4 and 6 the morphology is preserved going from b to u rest - frame ; in the remaining case the bulge becomes much less luminous in u and the star formation regions of the disk make the morphology looking more irregular .    _",
    "perturbed spirals .",
    "_ the galaxies in the panels 7 , 8 and 9 have been classified as spirals according to the presence in their b - band rest - frame of a disk structure with a central bulge ( less luminous that in the above case ) .",
    "the peculiarity depends on the presence of asymmetric structures ( zones of high star formation or interactions )",
    ". also in this case , the u rest - frame luminosity of the central bulge decreases , making the asymmetries more evident .",

    "_ irregulars .",
    "_ in all the three cases the irregular morphology is preserved , as expected .    observing the fig .",
    "[ kcorr ] , it turns out that the most important effect of the morphological @xmath18-correction concerns objects with a b rest - frame spiral - like morphology , which may become irregulars in the u rest - frame imaging . in order to quantify the percentage of mis - classified spirals at @xmath38 ,",
    "we have performed the comparison between b and u rest - frame imaging over a sample of 27 disk galaxies at @xmath44 .",
    "we found that the morphology moved to irregular only in 5/27 cases ( 18% ) .",
    "since we do not know if the @xmath44 galaxies are representative of the universe at higher @xmath4 , this result suggests that at @xmath38 the fraction of irregular galaxies could be slightly over - estimated , as the fraction of spirals could be slightly under - estimated .    we have also performed the above analysis over a sample of 10 elliptical galaxies at @xmath44 , seeking cases similar to panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ kcorr ] .",
    "we concluded that the the cited case is the only in which elliptical morphology is not preserved moving from b to u rest - frame .",
    "then the number of elliptical galaxies at @xmath43 seems to be rather solid .",
    "gasphot is a package for fully automatic surface photometry of galaxies , with a very low level of visual interaction , hence particularly suitable for very large imaging datasets ( pignatelli et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , its validity for morphological classification is to be considered only in a statistical sense , rather than on a single object basis .",
    "the tool uses a modified version of sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to identify galaxies in the image and to extract isophotes .",
    "then it analyzes the profiles and derives the main photometric parameters of each identified object .",
    "the program determines the light growth - curves along the major and minor axes .",
    "these are then fitted with a srsic law ( @xmath49 ) , convolved with the psf , with five free parameters : the total magnitude @xmath50 , the half - luminosity radius in arcsec @xmath51 , the srsic index @xmath19 , the axial ratio @xmath52 and the value of the local background .",
    "this one - dimensional approach provides a more robust estimate than a more complex 2-d fit of the surface brightness image , which is more sensitive to the presence of features like spiral arms , double nuclei or dust lanes .",
    "it is also less affected by instrumental artifacts in the real image , particularly for very faint galaxies like our own .    profiles with high values of the srsic index imply an early - type morphology ( the de vaucouleurs profile has n=4 ) , while low values usually indicate later - type morphologies ( the exponential profile has n=1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , many bulge - dominated objects have intermediate srsic indices , or even an exponential profile , so a residual degeneracy still remains in assigning the morphological class .",
    "the situation gets more complicated when treating irregular galaxies and when dealing with blended objects .",
    "the isophotes flagged by sextractor as blended are not used in the fit , in order to minimize distortions .",
    "this makes the fitting procedure much more certain . in this framework",
    ", irregular galaxies can only be identified by very large @xmath53 or failed fits . in these cases , however , the photometric parameters obtained are obviously meaningless .",
    "galfit is an automatic tool to extract structural parameters from galaxy images . at variance with gasphot",
    ", galfit fits the whole 2-d sky - projected light distribution .",
    "it combines together different parametric models ( the nuker law , the srsic - de vaucouleurs profile , the exponential disk , the gaussian or moffat functions ) and allows multi - component fitting ( useful to calculate e.g. bulge / total light ratios ) and provides measures of the diskyness / boxyness of the examined galaxy .",
    "if available , the psf is used to convolve the model before fitting .",
    "it is also possible to mask out of the fit peculiar regions ( dust lanes , nearby companions , spiral arms , etc . )",
    "that the user wants to exclude .",
    "for the two tools is reported in each panel . ]",
    "even if galfit allows to reach a high level of detail in modeling galaxy light , it needs substantially more interaction for each individual object and it works well for bright galaxies with good sampling , rather than for the fainter ones closer to the sensitivity limit .    we have built a tool automatically running galfit over all galaxies of interest , making use of sextractor to determine the required initial guess of the model parameters ( magnitudes , scale radii , axial ratios and position angles ) .",
    "although galfit can in principle use multi - component models , in order to compare with each other the results from galfit and gasphot , we have forced galfit to the single component , srsic model .",
    "we must also first clear the sample from the objects for which the two tools were not able to produce a fit .",
    "in fact , because of the numerical approximations involved and in order to avoid unrealistic run - away solutions , gasphot allows the fitting parameters to move during the fitting process in the region limited by @xmath54 pixels and @xmath55 only .",
    "solutions whose best fit - parameters are beyond these boundaries are rejected , and the related galaxies are flagged as `` failed fits '' .",
    "galfit has no such limits : however , in order to perform a consistent comparison between the results of the two tools , we put the same limits on the best - fit parameters of both tools and removed from the sample those for which one of the two tools was not able to find a solution .",
    "in addition , due to the very low s / n ratio , gasphot and galfit were not able to produce any fit for 16 and 14 galaxies , respectively .",
    "once we removed these objects , mainly irregular or high asymmetric objects , the galaxies left in the sample are respectively 254 ( gasphot ) and 236 ( galfit ) , of which 211 are in common .    in fig .",
    "[ sersic_gal_vs_gas ] we have reported the srsic indices retrieved by gasphot against those obtained by galfit , finding that 73% of the sample is included in the region , where @xmath56 is the average of the two results , while 9% have @xmath57 . it is worth stressing that , even though for toy galaxies the results from gasphot and galfit have been found to differ less than 10% from one another ( pignatelli et al . 2004 ) , the large scatter in figure 3 is not surprising when dealing with real featured galaxies , with light distributions often asymmetric and far from being stick to the models . in particular , due to the different fitting approaches adopted ( 1d vs. 2d ) , we expect that gasphot and galfit provide rather different results at increasing asymmetry .",
    "thus , we split the figure  3 in different bins of the asymmetry parameter a. actually , apart from the first asymmetry bin , the scatter around the 1:1 relation increases with the asymmetry of the galaxies analyzed , and a similar trend is found for the number of failed fits as a function of the asymmetry : more asymmetric galaxies are obviously harder to model with a spherically symmetric srsic law .",
    "the large scatter observed in the first bin of a is due to the predominance of early - type galaxies ( high values of srsic index ) and to the fact that the uncertainty of the retrieved values of @xmath19 intrinsically increases with the srsic index itself ( pignatelli et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "a similar trend is visible in fig .",
    "[ re_gal_vs_gas ] , where we show the comparison between the optical radii retrieved by the two tools .",
    "even now 73% of the sample is comprised in the region @xmath58 in this case , however , the scatter around the 1:1 relation is not symmetric : there is a large amount of galaxies for which the galfit scale radius is considerably larger than that obtained by gasphot .",
    "a similar effect was also found by pignatelli et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in a systematic comparison between the two tools .",
    "we checked visually the objects for which this difference was more noticeable .",
    "we found that , for compact objects with a small isophotal radius and high srsic index , galfit can sometimes recover unrealistic optical radii , often many times larger than the isophotal area itself .",
    "finally , we want to investigate further whether a criterion based on the srsic index could be able to separate early- from late - type galaxies .",
    "ravindranath et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for example classified as bulge - dominated and disk - dominated galaxies objects with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ mclas_gal_vs_gas ] the distributions of the srsic indices obtained by gasphot and galfit for the five morphological classes are reported ( normal es / s0 and perturbed ellipticals are plotted together ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that , while the results of the two tools for individual objects may differ , the statistical distributions are quite similar .",
    "the number of elliptical / s0 galaxies ( morphological class 1 and 2 ) which have srsic indices lower than 2 are only 6 and 3 according to gasphot and galfit respectively . instead , the contamination of late type galaxies with srsic indices greater than 2 is larger ( 56/254 and 50/237 , according to gasphot and galfit respectively ) . from figure 4",
    "we must conclude that the srsic index alone just provides a broad , not univocal indication of the morphological type . since this index is a measure of the concentration of light ,",
    "this is in agreement with the results of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who found that , besides the concentration , at least one more parameter is needed to classify galaxies .",
    "the non - parametric methods for morphological estimates are those which do not need to assume a parametrized analytic function to model the galaxy light distribution .",
    "they constitute an important complement to the problem of quantitative morphology ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 , conselice et al .",
    "2000 , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "we use the classical concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness ( or smoothness ) parameters .",
    "the concentration correlates with the srsic index : high concentration values correspond to early - type morphology , while lower values are suggestive of a disk - dominated or irregular galaxy .",
    "the asymmetry can distinguish irregular galaxies or perturbed spirals from relaxed systems as e / s0 and normal spirals .",
    "the clumpiness quantifies the degree of structure on small scales , and roughly correlates with the rate of star formation .",
    "the operational definitions of the three parameters may differ from author to author .",
    "we refer to the conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) definitions , but we modified them in order to make simpler and faster the computations . the concentration is a logarithmic ratio of the apertures containing 80% and 20% of the total flux : @xmath61 operatively , we interpolate the flux growth curve obtained using 12 aperture radii within which sextractor calculates the flux .",
    "the asymmetry measures how much the galaxy light is symmetric with respect to a rotation of 180@xmath62 around the galaxy centroid .",
    "so the asymmetry is qualitatively the residual of the difference between the original @xmath63 and the rotated @xmath64 galaxy ] in order to reduce the influence of the background noise , we subtract from the galaxy image the background given by sextractor , and we remove those pixels having values lower than 1.5 times the @xmath65 of the background .",
    "the results strongly depend on the adopted galaxy centroid .",
    "we solve this problem by computing the asymmetry on a grid of @xmath66 points around the center calculated by sextractor .",
    "the distance between contiguous points in this artificial grid is 0.4 pixels , so the asymmetry is computed for points up to @xmath67 pixels far from the initial center .",
    "the asymmetry is defined as the minimum of the values computed on the whole grid .",
    "the clumpiness measures the fraction of galaxy light lying in the high spatial frequencies .",

    "we use @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the flux_radius parameter given by sextractor ) respectively for galaxies with @xmath73 lower and greater than 5 pixels . again , in order to reduce the influence of the background noise we remove those pixels having values lower than 2 times the @xmath65 of the background .    to automatically compute the cas parameters for all the galaxies in our image",
    "we have used specifically a designed idl tool which uses sextractor to produce the flux growth curves of galaxies , then idl calculates the concentration indices , subtracts the background and filter noisy pixels .",
    "finally a postage cut for each galaxy of interest is produced and these postages are suitably rotated and convolved to calculate asymmetry and clumpiness .",
    "we compute the cas parameters in the acs bands roughly corresponding to the b - band rest frame for each galaxy .",
    "the poor sampling of high z galaxies is likely to affect the measures of the cas parameters . to check and quantify this point , we have simulated the effects of moving local galaxies with known cas values to higher redshifts .",
    "we have used as test objects all the galaxies in the sample having .",
    "following conselice ( 2003 ) , the angular size of galaxies is reduced by a rebinning factor @xmath74 given by the ratios of the angular diameter distances : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the initial and final redshifts .",
    "then , pixel fluxes are reduced by the cosmological @xmath78 factor and are k - corrected .",
    "operatively , we first filter out the noise of the test galaxies with a simple smoothing algorithm , and , after rebinning , changing the angular sizes and correcting the pixel fluxes , we convolved the images with a model of the psf .",
    "finally the noise is re - added and the cas parameters are computed .    in fig .",
    "[ cas_z ] we report the results of these simulations for 4 ellipticals , 7 spirals ( including normal and perturbed spirals ) and 11 irregulars galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "the ranges of values that we measured for the 300 galaxies in our sample are reported as vertical bars .",
    "although the number of simulated objects is not large , we note that the asymmetry a does not depend on @xmath4 for spirals and irregulars , apart from an increase of the scatter at increasing redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "a small increment of the mean value with z is present for the ellipticals .",
    "there is a moderate dependence on redshift in the estimate of concentration c for the ellipticals : values at @xmath79 are systematically lower than local values .",
    "again , the scatter increases with the redshift for all classes .    as for the clumpiness s , a bias appears to be introduced for all morphological classes , since the mean value increases artificially with redshift , while the scatter remains moderate .",
    "spirals and irregulars display a large spread in the values of the concentration and clumpiness which are not reproduced by our simulations , likely due to the small size of the local reference sample .",
    "accortding to the measures of non - parametric indicators on real galaxies , up to redshift @xmath80 , we have highlighted some biases in the cas structure of galaxies , introduced by instrumental effects .    in conclusion , our simulations suggest that cas parameters provide an effective tool to analyse and discriminate galaxy morphologies in the z - interval of the k20 sample .",
    "figures [ ca ] , [ sa ] and [ cs ] show the distribution of our galaxies sample in the cas space in various redshift bins .",
    "the different symbols refer to our visual morphological classification as discussed in sect .",
    "[ visual ] .",
    "objects in the morphological class 1 ( ellipticals and s0s ) separate significantly from the other classes .",
    "we have identified , independently from the redshift bin , the domains populated mainly by early - type galaxies , which are bounded by the continuous lines in the figures .",
    "these boundaries are given by the following conditions : @xmath81 we stress that these boundaries are independent of the galaxy redshift . only 1 elliptical galaxy lies outside from these regions ( it is in fact a very small galaxy with an uncertain classification ) .",
    "there are however 20 late - type galaxies out of 226 ( 9% ) , as judged from visual inspection , which fall within the early - type galaxy cas domain , and so would be misclassified by such criterion .",
    "it is worth to note that using different boundaries for each redshift bin reduces the contamination of late - type in the ellipticals domain of a small amount .",
    "this contamination is due to the following objects : 8 galaxies dominated by a luminous and symmetric bulge , but with evidence for a faint disk ; 3 ellipticals with a small companion in interaction ; 5 very compact objects , for which cas estimate is uncertain ; 4 further symmetric and concentrated galaxies , but clearly patchy , for which the measure of the clumpiness essentially fails because of the small area and high ellipticity .",
    "the datapoints corresponding to elliptical galaxies within the boundaries defined by eq.([earlycas ] ) show a scatter which sensibly depends on redshift : while it stays small up to @xmath82 , it tends to explode above this limit .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies belonging to class 3 , 4 and 5 do not show a tendency to segregate in the cas plots , but they occupy almost the same regions .    in conclusion",
    ", the application of the cas analysis to the k20 galaxies suggests this technique to be very efficient in disentangling early - type from late - type and irregular galaxies , with few percent of contamination . on the contrary",
    ", we failed in identifying algorithms able to resolve the different classes contributing to the late - type category .",
    "conselice ( 2003 ) noticed that the asymmetry and clumpiness parameters for normal galaxies in the local universe are correlated , populating a strip in the s - a plane . on the other hand , merging systems or irregular galaxies have typically the same clumpiness of the interacting components but higher asymmetry , hence they deviate from the relation .",
    "[ sa_mm ] confirms this trend in our sample : the two parameters are clearly correlated for normal ellipticals and normal spirals .",
    "because of the different operative definitions of the cas parameters with respect to those of conselice ( 2003 ) , we needed to recalibrate the relation . to this end",
    "we used the simulations described in sect .",
    "[ high - z cas parameters simulation ] using data on 4 ellipticals and 3 normal spirals and changing their redshift : our simulated a - s relation for normal ( e / sp ) galaxies is reported in the inset of fig .",

    "the plot confirms that the large majority of visually inspected normal spirals and ellipticals fall indeed within the boundaries .",
    "outside them only irregulars , peculiar spirals and some normal spiral are found",
    ".    however , this criterion appears of limited usefulness to disentangle normal spirals from irregulars because a large number of visually classified irregulars also fall in the normal galaxy region .",
    "in fig . [ dz ] the redshift distribution for all the five morphological classes are reported .",

    "the shaded regions account for the effects of morphological @xmath18-correction , as described in sect .",
    "[ morkorr ] : the upper limit for the irregulars ( and the lower for the spirals ) corresponds to the ( unrealistic ) case in which the @xmath18-correction does not affect the classification of objects with @xmath38 ; the lower limit for the irregulars ( and the upper for the spirals ) shows instead the case in which @xmath90 of the morphologically classified irregulars at @xmath38 are spirals .    the more evident result is the fast growth of the fraction of irregulars above @xmath91 , where they are the dominant population of the sample , being at @xmath9 more than the 60% of the entire population . the elliptical fraction remains near to 20% up to @xmath92 ( beyond this redshift the statistic is too poor ) , except for the point at @xmath84 , where the fraction is higher due to presence of the two clusters .",

    "given that in almost all cases we have the redshift only for the main object and we do not know if the observed pair consists of truly interacting objects or not .",

    "( 1995 ) up to i=24.5 within a circle of physical radius of 20 kpc .",
    "given that at @xmath98 the 20 kpc radius projects over a large area , the high contamination of spurious pairs makes not statistically significant the measures at such low redshifts .",
    "a second correction is needed to estimate how many of these physical pairs are going to merge .",
    "here we use the correction proposed by patton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , suggesting that in the local universe half of the pairs with relative velocities less than @xmath99 are expected to merge within 0.5 gyr .",
    "given that the velocity is expected to vary with redshift as @xmath100 , the merging fraction is obtained by multiplying the pairs fraction ( corrected for effects of projection ) by @xmath101 .",
    "for comparison , we have recomputed the merging fraction in a completely different way , based on asymmetry computation ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ) : an object is identified as merger if it has an asymmetry greater than a certain value ( in this case @xmath102 ) . also in this case cluster objects have been removed .",
    "this technique selects a different class of objects compared with those identified by pairs statistics .",
    "given that it is computed in a small area around the object , the highest asymmetry is measured for strongly interacting objects , rather than for objects in a pair often separated by many kiloparsecs , and that therefore do not fall together in the area for the asymmetry computation . moreover ,",
