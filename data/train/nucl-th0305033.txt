    "experimentally , @xmath3 is an extensively studied compound system by using different entrance channels , namely @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 , and at various incident energies ranging from 1.5 to 2.2 times the coulomb barrier ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite and the other direct and more recent refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at such incident energies",
    ", the incident flux is found to get trapped by the formation of a compound nucleus ( cn ) , which is in addition to a significant large - angle elastic scattering cross section . for lighter masses ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "such a compound nucleus decays subsequently by the emission of mainly light particles ( n , p , @xmath4 ) and @xmath11-rays ; i.e. with very small component of heavy fragment ( @xmath12 ) emission .",
    "an experimental measure of this so - called particle evaporation residue yield is the cn fusion cross section . for somewhat heavier systems , like @xmath13 and @xmath3 , a significant decay strength to @xmath12 fragments , the mass - asymmetric channels ,",
    "is also observed which could apparently not arise from a direct reaction mechanism because of the large mass - asymmetry differences between the entrance and exit channels .",
    "the measured angular distributions and energy spectra are consistent with fission - like decays of the respective compound systems",
    ".    for the @xmath14 reaction , in one of the experiments , the mass spectra for a=12 to 28 fragments and the total kinetic energy ( tke ) for only the most favoured ( enhanced yields ) @xmath4-nucleus fragments are measured at the energies @xmath15 121.1 and 141.8 mev , or equivalently at @xmath1651.6 and 60.5 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath3 is a negative q - value system ( negative @xmath17 , different for different exit channels ) and hence would decay only if it were produced in heavy ion reactions with sufficient compound nucleus excitation energy @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , to compensate for the negative @xmath17 , the deformation energy of fragments @xmath20 , their total kinetic energy tke and the total excitation energy txe , in the exit channel , as e_cn^*=q_out(t)+e_d(t)+tke(t)+txe(t ) ; [ eq:1 ] see fig.1 where @xmath20 is neglected because fragments are considered to be spherical . here",
    "@xmath21 is positive ( = 16.68 mev for @xmath1 entrance channel ) and hence adds to the entrance channel kinetic energy @xmath2 of the two incoming nuclei in their ground states . in another experiment @xcite for @xmath1 reaction at @xmath1651.0 and 54.5 mev , the excitation - energy spectra for only the symmetric @xmath9 and near - symmetric @xmath22 channels",
    "are measured , whose analysis indicate that a specific set of states in @xmath23 correspond to highly deformed bands . in other words ,",
    "the expected shapes of some of the observed fragments in the exit channel could be relatively deformed .",
    "it is interesting to note that this result is supported by a very recent study of the @xmath9 reaction at @xmath16 55 mev , where the population of highly excited states in the @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 nuclei indicated a selective and enhanced population of deformed bands @xcite . in a still other recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "the incident energy used in the same @xmath14 reaction is @xmath15 130 mev and an enhanced emission yield by a factor of 1.5 to 1.8 is observed for @xmath26 over the two @xmath4-particles .",
    "the aim of our present work is to understand some of the results of these experiments .    the above stated light particles ( @xmath27 ) production , the evaporation residue , is very satisfactorily understood as the equliberated compound nucleus emission in the statistical hauser feshbach analysis @xcite , using the lilita or cascade codes . the hauser feshbach calculations are also extended to include the complex fragments , like the ones observed in the experiments mentioned above .",
    "these are considered in the , so - called , busco code @xcite or the extended hauser - feshbach scission - point model @xcite . within the framework of the extended hauser - feshbach method @xcite , the above noted observed enhanced emission of @xmath26 over the evaporation of two @xmath4-particles in @xmath1 reaction",
    "is shown related to an increased deformation of the heavier fragment @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the emission of complex fragments ( @xmath12 , also called the intermediate mass fragments , imfs , or `` clusters '' ) is alternatively treated as the binary fission of a compound nucleus in the statistical fission models @xcite , using the gemini code @xcite or the saddle - point `` transition - state '' model @xcite .",
    "the transition - state model , treating the complex fragments emission as a compound - nucleus fission process ( the fusion - fission ) seems to explain the observed mass spectra and excitation - energy spectra rather well for the @xmath1 reaction at the two energies used in respective experiments @xcite .",
    "also , the measured tke for the symmetric fission is comparable to the saddle - point potential energy at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "then , there are other processes , like the deep - inelastic ( di ) orbiting or scattering , that have also been studied for this reaction but do not seem to explain the observed data @xcite .    in the statistical fission models",
    "@xcite , the fission decay of a compound nucleus is determined by the phase space ( level density ) available at the `` transition '' configuration , which is saddle or scission in these models . for light systems ,",
    "this choice can lead to a significant population of many energetically allowed mass channels , though there is no structure information of the compound system in these fission models .",
    "however , the structure effects of the compound system seem to influence the observed yields strongly since strong resonance behaviour is observed in the measured excitation functions of large - angle elastic and inelastic scattering yields in several light systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility to account for such structure effects is via the process of fragments ( or clusters ) preformation in a compound nucleus and its subsequent decay as a cluster decay process , proposed recently by some of us @xcite .",
    "the structure information enters the process via the preformation probability ( also , known as the spectroscopic factors ) of the fragments .",
    "we follow this approach of preformed cluster decay @xcite here in this paper .",
    "the cluster decay process was recently studied @xcite for the compound system @xmath0 , using the preformed cluster - decay model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for the decay of @xmath0 , the two processes of binary fission ( the dynamical collective mass transfer calculated , by some of us @xcite , in the quantum mechanical fragmentation theory @xcite ) and cluster decay are almost indistinguishable , particularly at higher angular momenta . however , this work was a simple model study where the role of tke was analysed and found to be significant for @xmath4-nucleus structure in the measured yields .",
    "this model is more recently re - formulated @xcite for the imfs emitted from an excited @xmath29 compound nucleus produced in low energy @xmath30 reaction .",
    "the imfs in @xmath29 are shown to be produced as multiple `` clusters '' of masses @xmath31 and only at @xmath32 mev , in agreement with experiments .",
    "both of these works @xcite show that the imfs in decay of excited @xmath29 or the complete mass spectra in decay of excited @xmath0 have their origin in the macroscopic liquid drop energy ( the shell effects are almost zero at the excitation energies involved ) . for @xmath29 decay , the light particles ( @xmath33 ) emission , other than",
    "the promptly emitted via the statistical evaporation process ( not treated in this model ) , is also shown to be given , but at higher energies where only the pure liquid drop energies enter the calculations .",
    "thus , the macroscopic liquid drop energy ( @xmath34 ) is shown playing the most important role in the cluster decay calculations .",
    "apparently , the compound nucleus being hot at the energies involved , the @xmath34 should also depend on the temperature t. this is done here in this paper for the decay of @xmath0 formed in @xmath1 reaction at the two energies , @xmath1651.6 and 60.5 mev @xcite . also , the other terms of the potential , that constitute the scattering potential @xmath35 , are considered t - dependent .",
    "the t - dependent liquid drop model used is that of davidson et al .",
    "@xcite which is based on the semi - empirical mass formula of seeger @xcite . the model parameters of seeger s formula at t=0 are re - fitted in view of the present availability of a larger data set for binding energies @xcite . for the t - dependence in @xmath35",
    ", we follow davidson et al . @xcite and some other authors @xcite , discussed below .",
    "the deformation effects of the fragments ( and the neck formation between them ) are included here within the extended model of gupta and collaborators @xcite , via a neck - length parameter at the scission configuration which simulates the two centre nuclear shape parametrization , used for both the light and heavy nuclear systems .",
    "a similar method has been used earlier by other authors @xcite , discussed below .    the dynamical cluster decay model for hot compound systems , a re - formulation of the preformed cluster - decay model ( pcm ) of gupta and co - workers @xcite for ground - state decays ,",
    "is presented in section 2 and its application to the hot @xmath0 nucleus data from refs .",
    "@xcite in section 3 .",
    "the ( statistical ) evaporation of light particles , that occur promptly before the beginning of the binary decay process of cluster emission studied here , is not included in this paper .",
    "hence , any discussion of light particles emission is that of one which is in addition to the ones emitted promptly . finally , a summary of our results is presented in section 4",
    "the cluster decay model developed here is the preformed cluster - decay model ( pcm ) of gupta et al .",
    "@xcite for the ground - state decays , re - formulated for hot and excited compound systems . in this model",
    ", we treat the complex fragments ( the imfs or clusters ) as dynamical collective mass motion of preformed fragments through the barrier .",
    "it is based on the well known dynamical ( or quantum mechanical ) fragmentation theory @xcite developed for fission and heavy ion reactions , and used later for predicting the exotic cluster radioactivity @xcite also .",
    "this theory is worked out in terms of the collective coordinates of mass asymmetry @xmath36 and relative separation r , which in a pcm allows to define the decay half - life @xmath37 , or the decay constant @xmath38 , as = ln 2=p_0_0 p , [ eq:2 ] where @xmath39 , the preformation probability , refers to @xmath40-motion and p , the penetrability , to r - motion .",
    "apparentlty , the two motions are taken as decoupled , an assumption justified in our earlier works @xcite .",

    "m is the nucleon mass .",
    "this means that @xmath44 in ( [ eq:2 ] ) gives the s - wave cross section , with a normalization constant @xmath41 , instead of the @xmath45 in ( [ eq:2a ] ) .",
    "however , in the present calculations , made for @xmath46 case , the normalization constant is obtained empirically from the experimental data . for @xmath40-motion",

    "in other words , the deformation effects of the two fragments are included here in the scattering potential v(r , t=0 ) for each @xmath40 by raising the first turning point @xmath51 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 or @xmath54 , which is equivalent of lowering of the barrier , as is found to be the case for deformed fragments @xcite .",
    "this method of inclusion of fragment deformation and the parametrization of the neck zone via a neck - length parameter @xmath55 in the present calculations is quite similar to what has been achieved in both the transition - state model of sanders @xcite ( in saddle point configuration ) and the extended hauser - feshbach method of matsuse and collaborators @xcite ( in scission point configuration ) .",
    "it is also shown in @xcite that the alternative of calculating the fragmentation potential @xmath56 and scattering potential v(r ) for deformed nuclei is not practical since the experimental deformation parameters for all the possible fragments ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) , required for calculating @xmath56 , are generally not available .",
    "the deformation effects of nuclei in our calculations are further included via the sssmann central radii @xmath59 , with the radii @xmath60 and surface thickness parameter @xmath610.99 fm .",

    ", we use an ansatz @xcite for the first turning point , r_a = c_t(,t)+r(,t ) , [ eq:5 ] which depends on the total kinetic energy tke(t ) . the corresponding potential @xmath67 acts like an effective , positive q - value , @xmath68 , for the decay of the hot compound system at temperature t to two fragments in the exit channel observed in the ground - states ( t=0 ) .",

    "thus , in view of the fact that we are dealing here with only the @xmath46 case and that the temperature effects are not included in full in the potential , the comparisons in fig . 6 between the theory and experiments could be said atleast reasonable .",
    "figure 7 shows the results of our calculation for total kinetic energy ( tke ) , with angular momentum @xmath103 effects included only in the scattering potential v(r ) .",
    "we notice that the calculated tkes for the sticking limit ( using @xmath129 ) compare reasonably good with the experimental data .",
    "this means that , even though @xmath74 is non - zero ( = 0.29 and 0.3 fm ) , the sticking limit for the moment of inertia is preferred .",
    "also , unlike the @xmath74-values , the @xmath103-values required for the case of higher energy data is now of a larger value ( @xmath130 for @xmath1660.5 mev as compared to @xmath131 for @xmath1651.6 mev ) , as expected .",
    "the measured tkes are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure 8 shows the scattering potential @xmath132 for temperature effects included in all the terms of the potential ( compare this figure for @xmath133 , with fig . 1 where temperature effects are included in @xmath88 only ) .",
    "notice that as @xmath103-value increases , the tke(@xmath74)-value increases , since the decay path for all the @xmath103-values begins at @xmath134 .",
    "figure 9 gives our calculated fragmentation potentials @xmath110 .",
    "the t - values chosen are the same as in fig .",
    "3 , where temperature effects were included only in the shell corrections . the r - values here are : @xmath135 , with @xmath74-values as shown in the figure .",
    "we notice in fig . 9",
    "that , due to the inclusion of temperature effects in all terms , the minima in the potential , which were earlier only for @xmath4-nuclei , are now obtained for both the @xmath4 and non-@xmath4 fragments .",
    "this happens , possibly , due to the pairing energy term @xmath136 in formula ( [ eq : a2 ] ) of davidson et al .",
    "@xcite , which goes to zero for @xmath137 mev .",
    "thus , with the addition of temperature , not only the shell structure effects go to zero but also the explicitly preferred @xmath4-nucleus structure washes out .",
    "also , we notice that the light particles ( @xmath27 ) structure changes ; in particular , the minimum at @xmath6 disappears and a shallow minimum at @xmath138 appears .",
    "figure 10 gives the preformation factors @xmath39 for the two experimentally chosen temperatures only , since the ground - state ( t=0 ) decay is not possible .",
    "we notice that the formation yields are large only for light fragments ( @xmath139 ) and are of the same orders as in fig .",
    "4 , except that now the non-@xmath4 fragments are also preformed equally strongly . however , the calculated decay constants , equivalently , the fragments ( s - wave ) production cross sections , in fig .",
    "11 do not show much improvement in their comparisons with experiments .",
    "the comparisons are now somewhat better for the heavier fragments but the yields for fragments lighter than a=9 are very low , lying below the chosen scale . on the other hand , the calculated tkes in fig .",
    "12 compare nicely ( even better than in fig .",
    "7 ) with the experimental data . only the case of sticking limit is shown since the @xmath74-values are still within the proximity limits .",
    "note that the @xmath103-dependent contribution is so far added here only in the scattering potential @xmath140 and not yet in the fragmentation potential @xmath110 which is needed for both the preformation factor and penetrability .",
    "this extention is being carried out .",
    "in summary , we have reformulated for hot nuclear systems , the preformed cluster - decay model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators for ground - state decays and applied it for the first time to the decay of a light compound nucleus such as @xmath0 formed in the reaction @xmath1 carried out at two incident energies @xmath2=51.6 and 60.5 mev @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the mass spectra for fragments heavier than mass 12 and the total kinetic energies ( tkes ) for only the favoured @xmath4-nucleus fragments are measured .",
    "also , at another energy , in between the two above , an enhanced yield is observed for @xmath26 over the two @xmath4-particles emission @xcite .",
    "our calculations are made first for the temperature effects included only in shell corrections and then in all terms of the potential , and in each case for @xmath103=0 only .",
    "the contribution due to @xmath103 is added only for estimating the tkes .",
    "similar to the saddle - point model @xcite and/ or the scission - point model @xcite , the deformations of the fragments are taken into account by the parametrization of the neck - in zone , proposed by gupta and collaborators @xcite . this quantity is @xmath40-dependent and could be calculated but is taken as a parameter here , which is the only parameter of the model .",
    "for the temperature effects included in shell corrections only , we find that the @xmath4-nucleus fragments are favourably preformed and are due to the macroscopic liquid drop energy alone since the shell effects are almost zero at the energies under consideration .",
    "the calculated decay constants or the normalized s - wave cross sections , in particular for the @xmath4-nucleus fragments are found to contain the complete structure of the experiments for a nuclear shape with fragments separated by about 0.3 fm which is within the limits of nuclear proximity effects .",
    "some of the light particles ( other than the ones constituting the evaporation residue , not included here ) are also predicted to be there in the mass spectra , but @xmath6 is shown to be absent . with",
    "angular moments effects included , the calculated tkes are found to compare rather nicely with experimental data for the moment of inertia calculated for a sticking limit .    for the full temperature effects in the potential",
    ", the non-@xmath4 fragments are also preformed equally strongly as the @xmath4-nucleus fragments .",
    "the cluster decay process now occurs at a somewhat larger separation distance , which is also temperature dependent .",
    "hence , the tkes for a sticking moment of inertia are now in somewhat better agreement with the experiments . however , the comparison between the calculated ( s - wave ) and measured mass spectra is not improved much , which calls for the inclusion of @xmath103-dependent potential in the calculations of yields also , which is underway .",
    "in eq . ( [ eq:10 ] ) we have defined , within the strutinsky renormalization procedure , the binding energy b of a nucleus at temperature t as the sum of liquid drop energy @xmath85 and shell correction @xmath108 , b(t)=v_ldm(t)+uexp(- ) .",
    "[ eq : a1 ] the @xmath71 dependent liquid drop part of the binding energy @xmath85 used here is that of davidson et al .",

    "evidently , these constants need be re - fitted since a large amount of data has become available @xcite , particularly for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we found that the measured binding energies could be fitted within 1 to 1.5 mev by changing the bulk constant @xmath146 and introducing a proton , neutron asymmetry constant @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath146 works as an overall scaling factor and @xmath147 controls the curvature of the experimental parabola ( and hence helps to fit the binding energies for neutron - rich nuclei ) , as expected .",
