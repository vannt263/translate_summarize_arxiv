    "recently , we have developed a method to test popular dark - matter models of structure formation using the number density and the two - point correlation function of high redshift objects ( bi & fang 1996 ) .",
    "we found an approximate expression of two - point correlation function of mass and collapsed halos in the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 , hereafter ps ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the nonlinear gravitational interaction was treated as the sum of various individual spherical top - hat clustering .",
    "these top - hat spheres consist of both collapsed ps halos and uncollapsed regions .",
    "moreover , the bias that massive ps halos have stronger correlation than the background mass can naturally be introduced by considering that no collapsed halo of mass @xmath2 exists in initial regions ( or top - hat spheres ) of mass less than @xmath2 .    this method was applied to civ absorption systems in qso spectra . because civ systems should be hosted by collapsed halos , one can obtain an lower limit to the spatial number density of these host halos from the observed civ number density .",
    "this requires that the hosts of civ should consist of halos with mass as low as @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - point correlation of halos is stronger when the mass of the halos is larger .",
    "the observed two - point correlation functions set a lower limit , @xmath4 , to the mass of host halos . obviously , a reasonable model has to give @xmath5 .",
    "the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model normalized to @xmath0 and the low density flat cold dark matter ( lcdm ) model can pass this test .",
    "however , for the cold - plus - hot dark matter ( chdm ) models with parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , or @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the two - point correlation functions of halos with mass @xmath3 are too small to explain the observed correlation functions . in order to have enough number of collapsed halos to host civ systems",
    ", @xmath3 should not be larger than @xmath10 .",
    "but the observed two - point correlation function on the scales of @xmath11 km / s indicates that @xmath4 should not be less than @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the same problem , but using qsos as the discriminator .",
    "the topic of finding constraints on dark matter models from qsos is not new . as early as 1980s , the highest redshift of qsos",
    "was used to rule out the model of hot dark matter ( hdm ) , because the hdm predicted that collapsed halos can not form at redshift larger than 3 , which is much less than the redshifts of many existing qsos .",
    "consequently , the formation of high redshift qsos can not be explained in the hdm model ( e.g. efstathiou & rees 1988 ) .",
    "this redshift test is passed for current dark matter models .",
    "for instance , the tilted cdm , scaled cdm and chdm models all are able to produce with the observed abundance of qsos ( nusser & silk 1993 ) . however , the qso abundance test alone is not free from the uncertainties of discriminating among the models like scdm , lcdm and chdm .",
    "while some works claimed that the chdm model is consistent with the qso abundance , other works found oppositely ( ma & bertschinger 1994 ) .",
    "we will show that adding a clustering test to the abundance fitting will reduce the number of free parameters in the discrimination , and gives much better results .",
    "the spatial number density of collapsed halos can be calculated from the standard ps theory .",
    "we define @xmath13 to be the 3-d density fluctuation field of dark matter extrapolated to redshift @xmath14 assuming linear evolution . a density field @xmath15 , representing the smoothed fluctuation on scale @xmath16 ,",
    "can be derived from @xmath13 by @xmath17 where the function @xmath18 is the top - hat window for the comoving volume @xmath19 .",
    "the total mass within @xmath20 on average is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mean density at the present if the scaling factor of the universe is set to be unity at @xmath23 .    for gaussian perturbations , the mass fluctuation within a top - hat window of radius @xmath16",
    "is described by variance @xmath24 , which is determined by the initial density spectrum @xmath25 and normalization factor @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 h@xmath1mpc ) . in the case of @xmath28 einstein - de sitter universe ,",
    "the linear evolution of the variance is @xmath29 .",

    "the differential @xmath38 gives the total mass of collapsed halos in the mass range @xmath2 to @xmath39 .",
    "hence , if @xmath40 is defined as the spatial number density of halos between @xmath2 and @xmath41 at @xmath14 , we have @xmath42 where we use the subscript @xmath43 in @xmath44 to emphasize that it is for collapsed halos .",
    "considering the cloud - in - cloud problem , the above defined @xmath44 should be multiplied by a factor of 2 .",
    "the normalization @xmath45 can then be fulfilled .",
    "therefore , the spatial number density of halos with mass between @xmath2 and @xmath41 at redshift @xmath14 is given by @xmath46 where erfc(x ) is the complementary error function .",

    "these halos have also proper spatial number density as the observed qsos .",
    "the difference between the two models are very small .",
    "in fact , the top - hat evolutions of a spherical mass in scdm and lcdm are indistinguishable , because it has almost the same dynamic trajectory in all flat universes with @xmath112 .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "2c shows that the two - point correlation functions of the chdm model are very small on large scales . for halos with mass @xmath113 ,",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function is well less than 0.1 on scales of @xmath1035 -10 h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "therefore , the chdm model seems to be unfavored under the abundance - plus - correlation test .",
    "according to the abundance , the mass of qso hosts in the chdm model should be as small as @xmath114 .",
    "on the other hand , the two - point correlation function of such halos is much less than what is observed .",
    "a possible way to save the chdm model is to assume that there is a very high biasing factor to raise the correlation function of @xmath115 halos in the chdm model . from fig .",
    "2c , if this factor is as large as 5 , the power of two - point correlation functions mass @xmath115 would be able to fit with qso s clustering . however , biasing is actually not a free parameter which can be arbitrarily chosen ( einasto et al . 1994 ) .    generally speaking",
    ", the correlation functions of objects identified from a mass field will be different from the mass itself . a different method in the identification procedure",
    "can lead to a different biasing .",
    "the question now is : can we choose other qso identifications to produce larger biasing , and then to give higher amplitude of the two - point correlation functions of qsos in the model ?    as an example",
    ", let us first consider the qso identification by velocity dispersion . it has been known for a decade that qsos with low redshift are preferentially located in small groups of galaxies .",
    "this is in evidence from qso - galaxy correlation function ( yee & green 1987 ) , civ - associated absorption in high redshift radio - loud qsos ( flotz et al . 1988 ) , clustering analyses of qso distribution ( bahcall & chokshi 1991 ) and the galaxy environments around qsos ( ellingson et al .",
    "it has been also shown that the velocity dispersion of galaxies around qsos is @xmath116 400 km s@xmath1 ( ellingson et al .",
    "therefore the environment suitable of qsos formation seems to be small groups of velocity dispersion @xmath117 .",
    "the strength of the qso correlation function , is intermediate between galaxies and rich clusters , so once again it is similar to galaxy groups .",
    "if we assume that high redshift qsos formed in the same environment as that in the low redshift , the qsos should be identified as collapsed halos with 3-dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath118 700 km s@xmath1 between @xmath119 and @xmath61 .    in the ps formalism",
    ", the comoving number density of halos with velocity dispersion @xmath120 can be calculated by @xmath121 as in eq.(4 ) , @xmath34 in eq.(11 ) is the critical overdensity for collapsed at redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath16 here is the same as in  2 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath120 and @xmath16 is given by ( narayan & white 1988 ) @xmath122 for einstein - de - sitter universe , and @xmath123 for open universe or the lcdm universe .",
    "the coefficient @xmath124 has been determined by comparing eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) with n - body simulation ( jing & fang 1994 ) .",
    "it found @xmath125 .",
    "for most calculations , @xmath126 is a preferred value .",
    "hence , one can safely use eqs.(11)- ( 13 ) even when the 3-d velocity dispersion is as large as about 800 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the total number density of the collapsed halos with the velocity dispersion greater than a certain value , say @xmath127 , is @xmath128    using eq.(14 ) , we found that the scdm and lcdm models can produce sufficient number of @xmath129 700 km s@xmath1 halos to fit with the number density of qsos .",
    "but the number of such halos in the chdm model is too small .",
    "to have enough number of halos , we should use @xmath130 300 km s@xmath1 or less in the chdm model .",
    "the mass of the @xmath120-selected halos can be determined from eqs.(12 ) or ( 13 ) .",
    "one can then calculate the two - point correlation functions of them by eq.(10 ) .",
    "here we get almost the same results as before because @xmath120 is one - to - one related to the mass or the radius of the top - hat windows .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "2c , the @xmath129 300 km s@xmath1 halos still lack of correlation power on all scales larger than 2 h@xmath1 mpc in the chdm model .    this result should be expected .",
    "an identification of objects from a density field is a sampling .",
    "as one knows , a sampled field will not be different from the original field on scales much larger than the characteristic scale , @xmath131 , of the sampling ( vanmarke 1983 ) .",
    "this means that , in principally , no biasing on scales larger than the characteristic scale can be introduced by the identification . for our question here , it is not easy to given the characteristic scale @xmath131 of the identification . however , it is probably reasonable to choose @xmath132^{1/3}r$ ] , where @xmath133 is the average of @xmath134 inside @xmath16 ( hamilton et al .",
    "so the scale @xmath131 is actually the coherence length of the density field smoothed by window @xmath16 .",
    "the distribution of halos should not be biased from mass distribution on scales larger than @xmath131",
    ". the correlation function can effectively be amplified by linear geometrical biasing only for large halos ( kaiser , 1984 ) .",
    "figure 2 show a break in the correlation functions at @xmath135 , which is roughly equal to @xmath131 .",
    "when @xmath136 , the correlation functions of the collapsed halos should approach to the mass correlations , while when @xmath137 , the biasing leads to larger correlation functions .",
    "all identifications based on gravitational parameters , such as circular velocity , virial temperature etc .",
    "are essentially equal to mass identifications , because for a gravitational collapsed systems these parameters are one - to - one related .",
    "therefore , they can be expressed as an equivalence to @xmath2 .",
    "biases in these parameters can not give significant different results from those using @xmath120 or @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , any non - gravitational identifications are not constrained by the gravitational characteristic scale .",
    "for instance , if gas processes in the formation of qsos play the role of biasing , the characteristic scale will not equal to @xmath131",
    ". however , the characteristic scale of gas processes should be much less than @xmath131 , because the velocity of gaseous component is too small to segregate the qso halos on scales of 5 h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "we showed that the abundance - plus - correlation test can serve as a promising discrimination among models of cosmic structure formation using the high redshift ( @xmath138 ) qso number density and their clustering on large scales ( 10 h@xmath1 mpc ) .",
    "we found that the scdm and lcdm model are consistent with the observations of abundance and two - point correlation , while the chdm models is difficult to fit with the observed numbers .",
    "the contributions of variously biasing mechanisms have been investigated .",
    "a bias , in fact , is a model of the environment suitable to form objects , or a phenomenological relationship between the cosmic density field and qsos .",
    "we have studied possible biasing processes , including both gravitational and non - gravitational origins .",
    "none of them seems to give large characteristic scale and clustering amplitude required to make the chdm model success .",
    "one should also consider the possibility that each halo may host more than one qsos . in this case , the correlation function can be stronger than that of one - qso / one - halo model . in order to fit with observed abundance of qsos in the chdm model , one can assumed that each halo of @xmath139 host more than 10 qsos . in this case ,",
    "halos of @xmath139 in the chdm can also fit with the observed two - point correlation function of qsos ( fig .",
    "however , this apparently leads to the paradox that we did not found so many bright qsos concentrating in galaxy groups . a possible way to explain",
    "it is that the lifetime of qsos is just longer than the cosmic time at @xmath140 but shorter than the cosmic time at the present .",
    "( if qsos have a life time shorter than the cosmic time at @xmath140 , we require even more low mass halos , this makes the situation even worse . )",
    "however , the difference between the cosmic time at @xmath140 and @xmath23 is only a factor of 8 ( @xmath141 in the @xmath142 universe ) .",
    "therefore , we may predict that on average , each of 8 galaxy group will have a bright qso .",
    "this is not true .",
    "otherwise , we should require a very particular mechanism to make the qso formation at @xmath140 .",
    "it is theoretically possible to explain any correlations if we are allowed to introduce _ unknown _ inhomogeneity into the density field , and assume that the correlation of qsos absorbers is given by these inhomogeneities . however , to plan these inhomogeneities is equal to put desired structures in the initial perturbations .",
    "such models will , however , no longer be the scdm , lcdm or chdm models , which are based on initial fluctuations produced at the inflationary era .",
    "however , even in this case the chdm will still be difficult to produce enough halos with reasonable velocity dispersions to fit with the abundance of high redshift qsos .",
    "we benefit by the discussions and comments from yipeng jing and houjun mo , and thank j. einasto for suggestions given in his referee report .",

    "<S> we apply this method to examine the properties of possible host halos of qsos in three popular models : the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model , the low density flat cold dark matter ( lcdm ) model and the cold - plus - hot dark matter ( chdm ) model . </S>",
    "<S> the lcdm and chdm models are normalized to the cobe - dmr observations , and the scdm is normalized to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the scdm and lcdm models can pass the abundance - plus - correlation test for qsos . </S>",
    "<S> however , the chdm are difficult to produce host halos to fit with the number density of high redshift qsos and their clustering on large scales ( 10 h@xmath1 mpc ) simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we studied various mechanisms , originated both gravitationally and non - gravitationally , which may lead to a biasing of the halo clustering . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that these effects are too weak in order to release the trouble of the chdm models .    </S>",
