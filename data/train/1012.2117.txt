    "single - electron devices are currently conceived to take advantage of the tunnel current between quantum states belonging to nano - scale particles @xcite . up to now , the study of such tunnel current has been carried out using simple phenomenological ( i.e. rate equation ) approaches @xcite or more complex quantum theories including negff @xcite , transfer hamiltonian approach @xcite . concerning the first case ,",
    "simple rate equations give us useful and intuitive approaches .",
    "the effects of local potential due to selfcharge can be also included by means of a couple of master equations @xcite.on the other hand , quantum study of non - equilibrium schemes results in a more complex approach .",
    "+ until now research has been mostly concentrated on single dots , but rapid progress in microfabrication technology has made possible the extension to couple - dot system with aligned levels @xcite .",
    "a very interesting result was obtained by shanguan et al @xcite .",
    "these authors describe the transport in one - dimensional quantum dot array by using many body approaches . up to now the only computation of transport in an array of quantum dots",
    "was done by carreras et al @xcite but no local potential due to selfcharge was included .",
    "+ in this work we present a semiclassical approach based on non - coherent rate equations @xcite that is extended from two to an arbitrary number of quantum dots either serial , parallel and square array .",
    "the whole array of quantum dots has been treated as a separated quantum system .",
    "then the leads ( reservoirs ) were incorporated through the rate equations for single dots . in this approach",
    ", the coherent effects does not appear and the probabilities of finding an electron in two different dots are coupled by some rate @xmath0 .",
    "this treatment is called classical ( non - coherent ) approach .",
    "+ the effects of the local potential are computed within the selfconsistent field ( scf ) regime .",
    "the scf method is widely used because the exact method based on a multielectron picture is usually impossible to implement .",
    "as example we compute the total current and charge transport distribution @xmath1 for two parallel and serial quantum dots ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the model has been implemented in a home made program in matlab code that gives us the current voltage characteristics , the differential conductance and the population inside each dot for a range of applied voltage .",
    "some known results as negative differential resistance ( ndr ) and resonant conductance are well explained .",
    "moreover we found that the parallel quantum dots act like two independent conduction channels .",
    "+     are the tunneling rates between each part of the system . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electrochemical potentials in right and left lead , respectively .",
    "representation of the two different systems : serial configuration ( a ) and parallel configuration ( b).,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "when we have two leads coupled to a system with no voltage applied between them , the system is in equilibrium with a common electrochemical potential . in this equilibrium state , the average number of electrons in any energy level is given by the fermi function : @xmath4 an applied bias voltage @xmath5 drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "each contact tries to bring the system into equilibrium with itself .",
    "the system is thus forced into a balancing act between two reservoirs with different population .",
    "then , the average number of electrons @xmath6 inside the system will be something between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "rate - equation calculation consider the dynamic behavior of the number of electron @xmath9 at each quantum dot balanced with the incoming and outcoming flux either from a partially filled ( @xmath10 ) lead or other quantum dot ( @xmath11 ) @xcite",
    ". +      rate - equation for serial qd can be written as follow : @xmath12 @xmath13 where coefficients @xmath14 are the transition probabilities as described in figure 1a .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath7 are the fermi - dirac distribution functions in the electrodes .",
    "density of states at electrodes is considered constant in the energy range that transport takes place .",
    "@xmath9 is the average number of electrons at @xmath15 qd .",
    "+ the steady state solution of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give as the expression @xmath16 @xmath17 besides the out coming net flux from qd2 to the right lead is @xmath18 that help us to consider a n - independent way to express the current using ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) @xmath19 the expression of the current can be physically interpreted quite easily : the three barriers in the qd stack act as a series conection of resistors corresponding to the inverse of tunnelling rates @xmath20 .",
    "we can propose the same procedure for parallel qd . in this case rate - equations are @xmath21 @xmath22 considering the figure 1b .",
    "the steady - state solution of ( 8) and ( 9 ) is @xmath23 @xmath24 the net out coming flow is @xmath25 for each quantum dot . and",
    "substituting ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in ( 12 ) we obtain the n - independent expression of the current @xmath26      up to now we are considering only one energy level per dot .",
    "but we have missed the broadening of the level that inevitably accompanies any process of coupling to it .",
    "the standard way to introduce energy level broadening as a consequence of contacts is to assign a lorentzian shape to density of states @xcite @xmath27 the broadening @xmath0 is proportional to the strength of the coupling .",
    "@xmath28 , where @xmath14 are the transition rates introduced before .",
    "this comes out of a full quantum mechanical treatment , but we could rationalize it as a consequence of the `` uncertainty principle '' that requires the product of the lifetime @xmath29 of a state and its spread in energy @xmath30 to equal @xmath31 .",
    "the current expression is modified into : @xmath32 where now @xmath9 can be interpreted as the non - equilibrium distribution functions .",
    "this allow us to compute the total number of electrons at each qd as @xmath33 this procedure allow to rewrite n - independent equations as @xmath34 @xmath35 for serial and parallel currents . where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the density of states in the leads ( constants )",
    ", while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the dos in each qd .",
    "another factor that we have to take into account is how the voltage applied to the external electrodes change the electrostatic potential inside each dot .",
    "it is easy to see that this can play an important role to determining the shape of the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "the classical right solution of potential at each quantum dot involves poisson equation : @xmath40 where solution is @xmath41 being @xmath42 the laplace solution of the system . considering the capacitive coupling and boundary conditions",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 covers all the elements of the system , including electrodes and arbitrary number of qd , and @xmath45 is the capacitive coupling between @xmath44 and @xmath46 element .",
    "finally @xmath47 .",
    "the charge energy system constant @xmath48 gives us the potential increase as a consequence of the electron addition .",
    "we observe that potential depends on the increasing charge density , but at the same time charge density depends on energy level , a function of local potential .",
    "this considerations confers equation for n ( 16 ) and for u ( 23 ) , the position of master equations , as usual in similar cases ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . + for serial qd we can consider that first qd is capacitive coupled with left lead and second qd , while the second qd is only coupled with the first qd and the right lead .",
    "thus the laplace potential results are @xmath49 where we consider @xmath50 the potential of left electrode and 0 for the right one .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are coupling capacities between qd and electrode and between qds .",
    "@xmath53 is the total potential in the @xmath15 qd . +",
    "similar expressions can be derived for the parallel system : @xmath54 we shall solve @xmath55 and @xmath56 equations simultaneously in an iterative process forcing comparison of results @xcite and thus ensuring simultaneous convergence .",
    "for simplicity we consider fully symmetric system @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the effects of local potential on dos should be computed as @xmath59 , which will modify computations for population @xmath6 and currents @xmath60 .",
    "transport requires energy levels of qds to be between electrochemical potentials of leads .",
    "moreover overlapping of the dos is also required .",
    "both conditions ensure electron transport and net current . in this model",
    "we consider @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "both conditions are necessary for coulomb blockade @xcite . the self - consistent charging model based on the poisson equation represents a good zero - order approximation ( called hartree approximation ) to the problem of electron - electron interactions , but it is generally recognized that it tends to overestimate the effect .",
    "corrections for the so - called exchange and correlation effects are often added , but the description is still within the one - electron picture which assumes that a typical electron feels some average potential , u , due to the other electrons . despite our self - consistent potential model",
    "do not explain potential differences between spin up and down as consequence of broken spin degeneration @xcite , we can obtain a first approach to coulomb blockade .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show obtained intensities for parallel model in a range of capacities values .",
    "the @xmath63 curve is strongly dependent on @xmath51 and @xmath52 through the laplace     characteristics calculated in the parallel configuration in a different range of parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "the value of the capacity indicates how the system is coupled .",
    "when @xmath51 tends to cero , the two qd are electrically decoupled with the leads and the potential has not laplace term , this case implies a lightly coupled system .",
    "the other case is when the value of the capacity between qd ( @xmath52 ) goes to cero , which means no electrical influence between qd .",
    "the poisson term follows the charge @xmath1 at each qd and it is therefore always positive , inducing a shift on the potential .",

    "first we compute the laplace domain at each qd , as follow @xmath73 that define a recurrence , ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) . in order to analyze the results we will extend the series for the energy level of one dot .",
    "thus energy level becomes @xmath74 where we have used that the recurrence is a geometric series , @xmath75 .",
    "the value @xmath66 is the coupling capacity with the second lead .",

    "the rectifying effect disappears and resonant peaks appears when the qd is strongly coupled with the lead .",

    "the potential threshold becomes : @xmath79 two potential thresholds appear , for positive and negative voltage , as a consequence of previous condition .",
    "this creates a region in which no transport occurs because the previous condition is not accomplished , hence a conductance gap appears .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath63 curves is reached when @xmath80 .",
    "this condition occurs when @xmath81 or @xmath82 . in the case of a non - degenerate semiconductor",
    "the only possibility of broken symmetry is the different capacitive coupling between the two leads . as we can see from the expression (",
    "27 ) and its equivalent for @xmath83 , if the two qds have the same @xmath84 and equal capacity values each qd acts like a independent conduction channel due to the electrostatic potential is equal in each dot .",
    "furthermore the electrostatic coupling between neighbours is a second order effect .",
    "+ figures 4a and 4b show obtained intensities for serial model in a range of capacity values , in the same cases as before .",
    "now , the electron has single transport way and conditions for transport are more restrictive .",
    "overlapping of the density of states between qds is also required .",
    "conductance is depicted in figure 5a and 5b for the two ranges of capacities .        as we did before , the evolution of the energy levels inside each qd taking into account ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) are @xmath85 @xmath86 where we have used the same geometric recurrence as before . for simplification we have considered @xmath82 .",
    "now the two conditions imposed before in order to transport occurs and can be summarized as @xmath87 . as we can see from the expressions ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) , @xmath88 increases faster than @xmath83 and thus the condition @xmath77 can not be accomplished .",
    "introduced dos broadening relaxes restrictive conditions for transport as a result of energy channel overlapping .",
    "when the voltage increases , the separation between @xmath88 and @xmath83 increases as well and then the overlapping between dos decrease closing some channels and decreasing the outcoming flow . as a consequence a ndr appears due to the different electrostatic coupling in each dot @xcite .",
    "the @xmath63 peak is related with the maximum overlapping between the dos of the first and the second qd @xcite .",
    "moreover the width is related with the dos broadening .",
    "a simple phenomenological model of the conduction between serial or parallel quantum dots has been developed based in rate equations for non coherent qd system .",
    "this approach provides the most simple and transparent way for a description of electron transport . in the beginning we consider a system of two qd linked by a ballistic channel and connected with the emitter and collector reservoirs .",
    "level broadening has been introduced in the dos changing the expression for current and the population inside each dot .",
    "moreover this model can be extended easily to an array of n@xmath89 m qd .",
    "+ an important point has been the calculation of the local potential , solving the poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions for each dot and configuration . despite its simplicity",
    "the effect of self - charge has been token into account .",
