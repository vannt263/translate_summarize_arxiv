    "in the present article we will explore the propagation of a scalar degree of freedom on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the lattice is constant in time , but the geometric information about the lattice  encoded in a metric - like function  is allowed to vary spatially .",
    "in fact we are most interested in the case where the geometry fluctuates in a stochastic way along the lattice .",
    "we call this a _ random lattice_. the dynamics we consider for the scalar field is that of a massless klein - gordon field , discretized on a lattice with variable lattice spacing .",
    "thus , in the limit of the lattice spacings going to zero , one expects to obtain the well known continuum model .",
    "here we are however interested in the model with _ finite _ lattice spacing , but for excitations of the field that are on very large scales as compared to the average lattice spacing . in this regime",
    ", the system should show propagating waves , governed by a dispersion relation .",
    "the question we pose to ourselves is how this dispersion relation depends on the microscopic parameters of the theory .",
    "this is very much in analogy to the question of how to determine the speed of sound , and other macroscopic properties of a ( possibly amorphous ) solid , from the microscopic properties of its constituents .",
    "we are , however , not motivated by solid state physics , but by quantum gravity .",
    "the incorporation of the quantum nature of gravity is likely to change the structure of space - time on small length - scales .",
    "different such structures have been investigated , some motivated by full - fledged attempts to quantize gravity , some as toy models or as effective descriptions .",
    "one paradigm is that spacetime is fundamentally discrete , such as in the causal set approach @xcite , or in semiclassical considerations of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "another paradigm , pioneered by wheeler , has spacetime smooth , save for localized defects @xcite .",
    "our model here is an instance of the former , but could maybe also be read as a model of space - time defects in the limit where their density becomes very high .",
    "the model is very similar to the ones considered in loop quantum gravity @xcite , and references therein ( and some intermediate results of the present work were already contained in @xcite ) .",
    "there , dispersion relations were also calculated , but the calculations involved simplifications , effectively replacing a random lattice by a regular one , the parameters of which were obtained by averaging . in the present article we go beyond this , by obtaining exact results .",
    "we should point out that because we are working with a free massless field in two dimensions , the corresponding continuum model would be symmetric under the exchange of space and time coordinates .",
    "therefore , our model is mathematically equivalent to one in which spatial geometry is smooth and homogeneous , but time is a discrete variable . for simplicity , we will work in the `` discrete space , continuous time '' picture , but we will also give the results for the opposite case in an appendix .",
    "since we are working with random lattices , our results are stochastic in nature .",
    "so while we said that we would like to compute the coefficients in the dispersion relation , what we actually compute are expectation values ( and in one case the variance ) of such coefficients",
    ".    fields on random lattices have become a valuable tool in lattice gauge theory , starting from the pioneering works @xcite .",
    "we are , however , not aware of explicit results on the dispersion relations of these fields at finite lattice spacing . this may have to to with the fact that in this context , the random lattices are a tool to obtain statements on the continuum limit of the theories .",
    "effects of coupling to random fields on the dispersion relation have already been studied in detail in @xcite and @xcite . in these works",
    "there is no discreteness of space - time .",
    "rather , the random fields are an effective description of the effects of the cpt anomaly , caused by a nontrivial space - time topology on small length scales .",
    "while these models are vastly more physical , and can hence be used to obtain bounds on small - scale space - time structure , one can nevertheless compare them to our model on a mathematical level .",
    "the results bear some intriguing similarities but also some differences .",
    "these are discussed in a bit more detail at the end of this article .",
    "it should be said that our model is rather unphysical , in that it is 1 + 1 dimensional , and in that the field content is not realistic at all .",
    "what we hope to have accomplished , is to show how a calculation of phenomenologically interesting data from a model involving discrete , randomly fluctuating space - time can be accomplished .",
    "our calculations here can almost certainly be generalized to more realistic models ( using , for example , the voronoi - construction @xcite to obtain a random lattice in arbitrary dimension ) .",
    "they would merely be more cumbersome .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in the next section we will specify the details of the model .",
    "section [ se_disp ] explains the calculation of the dispersion relation .",
    "we end with a discussion of further prospects in section [ se_disc ] .",
    "two appendices contain some of the longer calculations , and the last appendix contains the dispersion relation for the case of continuous space and discrete time .",
    "we consider a bosonic field propagating on discrete space and continuous time .",
    "( the case of discrete time and continuous space is briefly discussed in appendix [ app_timespace ] . ) to keep things simple , we work in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the field is a function on the space @xmath0 .",
    "it will be denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the geometry of space is encoded in a time - independent , positive function @xmath2 .",
    "often it is also useful to re - express @xmath2 as @xmath3 . at this point",
    "we will make no further assumptions on @xmath2 , but we will later assume that it is _ random _ in a certain specific sense .",
    "the action for our model reads @xmath4.\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the forward discrete derivative , @xmath6 .",
    "it was used for simplicity .",
    "a more symmetric derivative could be used in its place .",
    "we will also use its adjoint @xmath7 with respect to the sum over @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 can be viewed as a discretization of the action for a free massless scalar in the continuum , but ultimately an action of this form may be derived from a theory of quantum gravity , and thus regarded as fundamental .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath10 where we have introduced the discrete , positive definite laplacian @xmath11 for completeness , we also state the hamiltonian @xmath12 it is of the form that is obtained under certain assumptions in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the form of the function @xmath2 is obviously vital for the definition of the model . for our consideration ,",
    "three cases are of interest :    1 .",
    "@xmath2 is constant 2 .",
    "@xmath2 is periodic , with a certain period @xmath13 in @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath2 is obtained as an instance of a random process .",
    "case 3 is the one we want to consider .",
    "the simplest situation would be that the value of @xmath2 , would , for any given @xmath14 , be determined by the sampling of a certain random variable @xmath15 . another way to state",
    "this is that there are independent , equally distributed random variables @xmath16 and the function @xmath2 is a sampling of these .",
    "more complicated situations ( for example correlations between the @xmath16 ) are also conceivable",
    ".    as we will see , it will be important to have information about the distribution of values @xmath17 in the sampling of @xmath18 .",
    "of particular importance for us will be the _",
    "mean _ of the @xmath19 , as well as some related quantities .",
    "such information may in principle be obtained through the law of large numbers , or a central limit theorem .    to be concrete let us fully specify one simple model : to make the description simple",
    ", we will not specify the distribution of the variables @xmath16 , but those of the @xmath20 .",
    "we denote expectation values by angular brackets @xmath21 .",
    "let all the random variables @xmath20 be independent gaussian distributions with first and second moments @xmath22    returning to the list of cases from above , the first case is that of an equidistant lattice .",
    "it is immediately solvable .",
    "the second case is still solvable and we will use it in order to analyze the case we are really interested in .",
    "we will see that we can obtain the lowest order terms of the dispersion relation for case 3 in a limit of case 2 .",
    "this will be explained in the following section .",
    "the problem of wave propagation on a random lattice is certainly a complicated one . in fact",
    ", we will see indications that it is not even always well defined , i.e.  that there is not always a long wavelength limit in which something resembling plane waves propagates on the lattice .",
    "the question is how to identify the cases in which the problem is well defined , and how to extract characteristic long wavelength quantities .",
    "we will not address these problems in all generality .",
    "but we will obtain a formula that , in a certain limit , gives the first few terms in the dispersion relation for the field .",
    "this limit is by no means well defined for all random lattices .",
    "if it is ill - defined , this is a strong hint that there is no regime in which the lattice supports propagating waves .    to start our quantitative discussion , we consider the case of a regular lattice . if all the @xmath23 are equal ( to @xmath24 , say ) , it is easy to solve the equations of motion of .",
    "the solutions are `` plane waves '' @xmath25 for the general case on the other hand , with generically all @xmath23 different , it is not possible to explicitly write down any solution to the equations of motion .",
    "the analysis we are aiming at in the present section lies somewhere in - between these two extreme cases .",
    "we will make an assumption on the @xmath23 under which we are able to treat the system analytically and try to remove it at the end of the analysis : let us assume that the system is periodic with @xmath26 the length of period .",
    "more precisely we assume that @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath29 with @xmath30 and make the ansatz @xmath31 this ansatz turns the equations of motion into an eigenvalue problem for @xmath32 and @xmath33 : is a solution iff @xmath34 the eigenvalues @xmath35 represent the different branches of the dispersion relation .",
    "we will presently see that there is one branch , denoted @xmath36 in the following , with @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "following the custom of condensed matter physics , we call this branch _ acoustic _ in contrast to the _ optical _ branches nonzero at @xmath39",
    ". the situation is sketched in figure [ fi3.1 ] .",
    "as we are interested in the low energy ( i.e. small @xmath33 ) behavior of the field , the acoustic branch is the relevant one for our purpose and we will compute its small @xmath40 behavior in the following . let us start by making the ansatz @xmath41 explicitly forcing @xmath42 to be zero .",
    "accordingly , we expand @xmath43 : @xmath44 we want to determine the coefficients @xmath45 of .",
    "the coefficients @xmath46 of the expansion on the other hand can be explicitly calculated .",
    "the calculation is cumbersome , so we have relegated it to appendix [ app_det ] .",
    "we find    [ pro_det ] for @xmath47 of the form , @xmath48g_i^{-1}g_j^{-1}\\\\      & + o(\\omega^6 ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    froom this , the coefficients @xmath46 can be read off . by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath43 order by order",
    ", we then obtain the low order coefficients of the dispersion relation .",
    "we use the shorthands @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 for the average of some quantity over the period of the lattice .",
    "then we have @xmath51 this is a remarkable formula , and one of the main results of the present work .",
    "it is an _ exact _",
    "result for the lowest orders of the dispersion relation of the field @xmath52 propagating on a periodic lattice . as such",
    ", it reproduces the elementary result for the case of the regular lattice , by setting @xmath53 for all @xmath14 and using @xmath54 we note that the square of the velocity of propagation , @xmath55 is neatly expressed in terms of averages over lattice spacings .",
    "the formula for the next order coefficient , @xmath56 is certainly more complicated , but also given in terms of such averages . this is more than just aesthetically pleasing",
    ": it suggests that may survive the large-@xmath13 limit .",
    "moreover , that when interpreting the @xmath23 as given by a sampling of some random process , such averages may be expressible by averages under this process , through some ergodic - type results .",
    "let us come back to our original motivation : we were interested in the case of a periodic lattice , because , for the @xmath19 determined by some random process , the limit @xmath57 , with the average length @xmath58 held fixed , gives an infinite random lattice .",
    "thus we would like to consider the dispersion relation in that limit .",
    "we see , however , no possibility to discuss this limit without fixing a distribution for the @xmath23 .",
    "central limit theorems would make statements about the expectation value of the mean @xmath59 and functions of it in the limit @xmath57 for large classes of distributions .",
    "they can similarly be used to obtain statements about the mean of the squares , @xmath60 , in this limit .",
    "but in our case , we need to investigate a function of both , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the case of the first term in the expansion .",
    "the second term in additionally depends on @xmath13 and on a curious linear combination of @xmath63 , thus further complicating the situation .",
    "let us therefore consider the situation described in in which the @xmath23 are independently gaussian distributed , with average @xmath64 and variance @xmath65 .",
    "what we want to do is to compute expectation values of the coefficients under this distribution , in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "let us first consider the coefficient @xmath66 of the @xmath67-term in . in appendix [ app_gauss ] we show that while we can not compute its expectation value directly , we can expand it in powers of @xmath68 , compute the expectation values of the first few terms , and take @xmath13 to infinity .",
    "the result @xmath69 strongly suggests , that @xmath70    for independent confirmation we have also checked this result on a computer , by calculating instances of @xmath66 for randomly generated sets @xmath71 .",
    "formula describes the numerical results very well .",
    "an example is given in figure [ fi_mc1 ] .",
    "furthermore , we are able to calculate the variance of @xmath66 , again as a series in powers of @xmath68 , and take the @xmath57 limit term - wise .",
    "it turns out that the variance _ vanishes _ in this limit : @xmath72details are again given in appendix [ app_gauss ] .",
    "the situation is more complicated with the term proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "expansion in @xmath68 ( see appendix ) gives @xmath74 which does not converge term by term in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "but this does not say that the limit does not exist .",
    "in fact , if one would extrapolate from the result for the coefficient @xmath66 , @xmath75 one expects the result to be finite .",
    "numerical results for small @xmath68 indeed point towards convergence ( figure [ fi_mc2 ] ) , but for larger @xmath68 , convergence in the limit @xmath57 could not be established",
    ". it may be there but too slow to be seen .    for completeness",
    ", we have also considered the case of discrete time and continuous space in appendix [ app_timespace ] .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is @xmath76 however , we have not considered the expectation values of the coefficients in any detail .",
    "in the present paper we have calculated the ( expectation values of the ) first coefficients in the dispersion relation @xmath77 for a scalar field propagating on what one could call a gaussian random lattice in 1 + 1 dimensions . the first term ,",
    "also setting the phase velocity , is unitless in our convention , thus the natural value is 1 .",
    "we have seen @xmath78 i.e.  it is in fact very close to 1 , as long as the variance of the lattice spacing is small .",
    "we have also presented very strong evidence that its variance is strictly zero for an infinitely extended lattice , thus one does not even have to take into account that in principle it has a probabilistic nature . in more realistic models , this coefficient would be very interesting for phenomenology : as was demonstrated in @xcite , experiments and observations are very sensitive to differences of propagation speed of the fields in nature .",
    "the second term had a more complicated structure , and convergence in the desired limit could not be demonstrated to complete satisfaction .",
    "we have conjectured the limit @xmath79 its scale is set by the average lattice spacing squared , @xmath80 , as long as the variance of the lattice spacing is small .",
    "we have also briefly discussed a model in which the roles of space and time are , switched , i.e. , time is discrete and space is continuous .",
    "there we see potential problems with causality , with phase and group velocity increasing due to the lattice effects .",
    "an interesting observation was made by a referee of a draft version of this article : the first two terms of the dispersion relation for the field on a regular lattice can be turned into the first two terms of the dispersion relation on the random lattice , by rescaling @xmath81 and dividing by @xmath82 in .",
    "it is very well possible , that this procedure gives the correct dispersion relation on the random lattice to all orders .",
    "this does not detract from the value of the results presented in the article : while there may be a shortcut , it is still neccesary to show that the shortcut indeed provides the right results .",
    "in fact , one big motivation for the article was that several different `` shortcuts '' were used in the literature on quantum gravity phenomenology , with different results .",
    "we should also point out that , despite the fact that the dispersion relation of the random lattice seems to be _",
    "obtainable from _ that of a regular lattice by the above scaling operations , it _ is not _ that of such a regular lattice .",
    "similar , but much more detailed , calculations were carried out in @xcite for random fields coupled to scalar and electromagnetic fields in physical space - time dimensions . since these were continuum models , one expects differences in the results : by reformulation our model in terms of a continuum field , one can show that in the equations of motion , there are correction terms of arbitrary derivative order , as compared to the equations of motion for the free scalar field . in contrast , the fields of @xcite receive only corrections in terms of first derivatives of the field .",
    "still the results on the dispersion relation are similar : the phase velocity receives a correction _ downward _ , and the coefficient of @xmath83 is negative , thus insuring causal propagation . moreover , the mathematical structure is similar : in both cases , the second moment of the random field enters the phase velocity , and the coefficient of @xmath83 is given by moments the autocorrelation of the random field , the first moment in case of @xcite , the second moment ( of @xmath84 ) in the present model .    besides finishing the discussion begun in the present work , by showing convergence or divergence of the second coefficient @xmath85 , and studying the complete model for more generic distributions for the random lattice , it would be interesting to study the nature of the eigen__vectors _ _ @xmath32 , at least in low order in @xmath40 .",
    "for example : does the one for the acoustic branch really look like a plane wave , at least for large @xmath13 ?",
    "obvious further goals are the extension of the formalism to vector and fermionic fields and to physical dimension . at that point",
    ", one would be in a position to compare the models with experiment and put bounds on parameters of , for example , loop quantum gravity .",
    "we thank f.r .  klinkhamer for sharing his insights about the phenomenology of quantum gravity , partially motivating the present work , and for numerous helpful comments on an earlier version of this article .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the spanish micinn project no .",
    "fis2008 - 06078-c03 - 03 .",
    "it is an elementary combinatorial fact that @xmath86 therefore the proof of the theorem reduces to the calculation of numerous sub - determinants of @xmath47 .",
    "these calculations are tedious but elementary . as a preparation",
    ", we observe that for @xmath14 in @xmath87 @xmath88 by repeatedly adding all other columns to the first one and pulling out factors . repeated use of the linearity of the determinant in the last column of yields @xmath89 another identity which will be used frequently .",
    "finally we introduce the abbreviation @xmath90.we turn now to the calculation of the lowest order coefficients in .",
    "@xmath92    by applying .",
    "let @xmath94 .",
    "we consider computing the sub - determinant of @xmath47 where row and column @xmath14 are deleted .",
    "@xmath95 the cases where @xmath96 and @xmath97 have to be treated separately , either by an explicit calculation or by appealing to the symmetry of the problem under cyclic permutations of @xmath98 .",
    "they yield the same result .      the calculation of the @xmath99 sub - determinants proceeds analogously to that in the last paragraph .",
    "let @xmath100 and consider the sub - determinant of @xmath47 where row and column @xmath101 and @xmath14 are deleted .",
    "again we start by expanding linearly in the first and the last column : @xmath102 again , the case where the first or the last row and column get deleted have to be considered in a separate calculation or treated by symmetry arguments . the same result is obtained in these cases .",
    "+ when summing over all such determinants , by summing over pairs @xmath103 , the result further simplifies : @xmath104 g_i^{-1}g_j^{-1}.\\ ] ]",
    "in the present appendix we collect some calculations regarding expectation values of the coefficients of the dispersion relation .    to make the notation more simple",
    ", we will not distinguish between the random variables @xmath105 and a sample @xmath71 of the random process anymore .",
    "the context will hopefully make the distinction clear .",
    "we start with the lowest order coefficient .",
    "we want to calculate @xmath106 it is convenient to go over to new random variables @xmath107 these are gaussian distributed with expectation zero and spread one . also introducing @xmath108 we can rewrite the expectation value as @xmath109 we were not able to compute this expectation value exactly",
    ". we can however expand it in a series that converges for small variance @xmath110 . to that end , we taylor - expand in @xmath110 , obtaining @xmath111 the terms in this series are such that their expectation values can be computed through tedious but straightforward calculations .",
    "we use @xmath112 to compute @xmath113 monomials in @xmath114 that contain odd powers of the @xmath115 vanish . taking the expectation value of",
    "the above taylor series then gives @xmath116 a remarkable aspect of this series expansion of the expectation value is that term by term , the limit @xmath57 is well defined , and suggests @xmath117 while the above calculations do not constitute a proof in the strict sense , we are quite confident that it is correct , since it is backed up both by heuristics and by numerical simulations .",
    "this is discussed in the main text .    for this term",
    ", we can even easily compute the variance with the same methods .",
    "we first have to expand @xmath118 again , the expectation value of each of the terms can be evaluated and the limit @xmath57 taken",
    ". we will only give the result : @xmath119 therefore we obtain the very simple result that @xmath72 the situation for the coefficient @xmath120 of @xmath121 is more murky .",
    "again we change variables and obtain , employing the same notation as above , @xmath122 again , we try an expansion in @xmath110 .",
    "we use @xmath123 and @xmath124 to find after some calculation @xmath125 the problem with this expansion is that , at least term by term , the @xmath57 limit can not be taken : the term proportional to @xmath126 diverges linearly with @xmath13 .",
    "this is despite some cancellation between the two terms that comprise @xmath127 .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this in the main text .",
    "as metioned in the introduction , we can also apply our calculations to the situation in which time is discrete and space is continuous and homogeneous , by exchanging the role of space and time in all formulas .",
    "the action in this case would read @xmath128\\ ] ] with the prime denoting the spatial derivative of the field @xmath129 .",
    "determination of the equations of motion proceeds in parallel with the main text .",
    "the wave - ansatz is now @xmath130 the calculation of the main text then gives the dispersion relation @xmath131 with @xmath66 and @xmath85 exactly as in , and .",
    "we can invert this series to get to the more familiar form @xmath76 we have not analyzed the expectation value @xmath132 in detail , but one can argue that since the distribution of @xmath133 is sharp in the limit @xmath57 one should have @xmath134 i.e. we obtain a positive correction to the continuum phase velocity . also , the coefficient of @xmath83 comes with a negative sign , thus presumably leading to an increase in group velocity , as well .",
