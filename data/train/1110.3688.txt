    "experiments now underway at the large hadron collider are striving to discover the agent of electroweak symmetry breaking , thereby revealing the origin of the masses of the elementary particles .",
    "many of the searches are phrased in terms of placing constraints on the properties of the scalar higgs boson state predicted to exist in the standard model @xcite . in that theory ,",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking occurs through the vacuum expectation value of a fundamental weak - doublet scalar boson . via the higgs mechanism @xcite , three of the scalar degrees of freedom of this particle become the longitudinal states of the electroweak @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons and the last",
    ", the standard model higgs boson ( @xmath8 ) , remains in the spectrum .",
    "recently , both the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern lhc have reported searches for the standard model higgs in the two - photon @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite decay channels .",
    "they have placed upper bounds on the cross - section times branching ratio ( @xmath10 ) in each channel over the approximate mass range 110 gev @xmath11 145 gev , generally finding that @xmath12 can not exceed the standard model prediction by more than a factor of a few .",
    "in addition , atlas has independently constrained the production of a heavy neutral scalar sm higgs boson with mass up to 600 gev and decaying to @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we apply these limits to the neutral `` technipion '' ( @xmath13 ) states predicted to exist in technicolor models that include colored technifermions . because both the technipion production rates and their branching fractions to @xmath0 or @xmath1 can greatly exceed the values for a standard model higgs , the lhc results place strong constraints on technicolor models .",
    "this strategy was first suggested as a possible for hadron supercolliders over fifteen years ago in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "technicolor @xcite is a dynamical theory of electroweak symmetry breaking in which a new strongly - coupled gauge group ( technicolor ) causes bilinears of the fermions carrying its gauge charge ( technifermions ) to acquire a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "if the technifermion bilinear carries appropriate weak and hypercharge values , the vacuum expectation value breaks the electroweak symmetry to its electromagnetic subgroup .",
    "fermion masses can then be produced dynamically if technicolor is incorporated into a larger `` extended technicolor '' @xcite framework coupling technifermions to the ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "producing realistic values of fermion masses from extended technicolor ( etc ) interactions without simultaneously generating large flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) is difficult ; the best prospects are `` walking '' technicolor models where the presence of many technifermion flavors causes the technicolor gauge coupling to vary only slowly with energy scale @xcite .",
    "even in those models , it is difficult to generate the observed mass of the top quark from etc interactions without producing unacceptably large weak isospin violation @xcite ; the best known solution is to generate most of the top quark s mass via new strong `` topcolor '' @xcite dynamics , without a large contribution from etc @xcite .    as we review below ( see also @xcite ) , many technicolor models , including those with walking and topcolor dynamics , feature technipion states , pseudo - scalar bosons that are remnants of electroweak symmetry breaking in models with more than one weak doublet of technifermions .",
    "production of light technipion states at lepton colliders has been studied by a variety of authors @xcite ; the most comprehensive analysis @xcite used lep i and lep ii data to constrain the anomalous couplings of technipions to neutral electroweak gauge bosons and derived limits on the size of the technicolor gauge group and the number of technifermion doublets in various representative technicolor models .",
    "subsequently , the authors of @xcite considered technipion phenomenology at hadron colliders ; they demonstrated both that technipions can be produced at a greater rate than the standard model higgs , because the technipion decay constant is smaller than the electroweak scale , and also that the technipions can also have higher branching fractions to @xmath0 or @xmath1 final states .",
    "as a result , the technipions are predicted to produce larger signals in these two channels at lhc than the @xmath8 would @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite searches for the standard model higgs exclude , at 95% cl , technipions of masses from 110 gev to nearly @xmath3 in technicolor models that ( a ) include colored technifermions ( b ) feature topcolor dynamics and ( c ) have technicolor groups with three or more technicolors ( @xmath4 ) . for certain models of this kind",
    ", the limits also apply out to higher technipion masses or down to the minimum number of technicolors ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also show how the limits may be modified in models in which extended technicolor plays a significant role in producing the mass of the top quark ; in some cases , this makes little difference , while in other cases the limit is softened somewhat .",
    "overall , we find that the atlas and cms significantly constrain technicolor models . moreover , as the lhc collaborations collect additional data on these di - tau and di - photon final states and extend the di - photon analyses to higher mass ranges , they should be able to quickly expand their reach in technicolor parameter space .",
    "dynamical theories of electroweak symmetry breaking embody the possibility that the scalar states involved in electroweak symmetry breaking could be manifestly composite at scales not much above the weak scale @xmath14 gev . in technicolor theories",
    "@xcite , a new asymptotically free strong gauge interaction breaks the chiral symmetries of massless fermions @xmath15 at a scale @xmath16 tev . if the fermions carry appropriate electroweak quantum numbers ( e.g. left - hand ( lh ) weak doublets and right - hand ( rh ) weak singlets ) , the resulting condensate @xmath17 breaks the electroweak symmetry correctly to its electromagnetic subgroup .",
    "three of the nambu - goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking become the longitudinal modes of the @xmath18 and @xmath7 , making those gauge bosons massive .",
    "the hierarchy and triviality problems plaguing the standard model are absent : the logarithmic running of the strong gauge coupling renders the low value of the electroweak scale natural , while the absence of fundamental scalars obviates concerns about triviality .    in so - called minimal technicolor models , there are no composite scalars left in the spectrum .",
    "however , many dynamical symmetry - breaking models include more than the minimal two flavors of technifermions needed to break the electroweak symmetry . in that case",
    ", there will exist light pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons known as technipions , which could potentially be accessible to a standard higgs search .",
    "technipions that are bound states of colored technifermions can be produced through quark or gluon scattering at a hadron collider , like the lhc , through the diagrams in figure 1 . in the models with topcolor dynamics , where etc interactions ( represented by the shaded circle )",
    "contribute no more than a few gev to the mass of any quark , there is only a small etc - mediated coupling between the technipion and ordinary quarks in diagrams 1(b ) and 1(c ) . combining that information with the large size of the gluon pdf at the lhc and the @xmath19 enhancement factor in the techniquark loop at left",
    ", we expect that the diagram in figure 1(a ) will dominate technipion production in these theories , which we study here and in section [ asec : topcol ] .",
    "technipions in models without strong top dynamics could , in contrast , have a large top - technipion coupling , making diagram 1(c ) potentially important ; we will consider that scenario in section [ asec : topetc ] .",
    "technipions that are bound states of non - colored technifermions would be produced at hadron colliders only through diagrams 1(b ) and 1(c ) , which would generally yield a significantly lower production rate ; we comment on these models in the discussion ( section [ axax ] ) .",
    "no single technicolor model has been singled out as a benchmark ; rather , different classes of models have been proposed to address the challenges of dynamically generating mass while complying with precision electroweak and flavor constraints .",
    "we will study the general constraints that the current lhc data can place a variety of theories with colored technifermions and light technipions . following @xcite , the specific models we examine are : 1 ) the original one - family model of farhi and susskind @xcite with a full family of techniquarks and technileptons , 2 ) a variant on the one - family model @xcite in which the lightest technipion contains only down - type technifermions and is significantly lighter than the other pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons , 3 ) a multiscale walking technicolor model @xcite designed to reduce flavor - changing neutral currents , 4 ) a low - scale technciolor model ( the technicolor straw man  tcsm  model ) @xcite with many weak doublets of technifermions and 5 ) a one - family models with weak - isotriplet technifermions @xcite . properties of the lightest electrically - neutral technipion in each model that couples to gluons ( and can therefore be readily produced at lhc ) are shown in table [ tab : technipions ] . for completeness",

    "we will now show how the lhc data constrains technipions composed of colored technifermions in theories where the top - quark s mass is generated by new strong  topcolor \" dynamics @xcite preferentially coupled to third - generation quarks .",
    "in such models , the etc coupling between ordinary quarks and technifermions ( or technipions ) is very small , so that gluon fusion through a top - quark loop will be negligible by comparison with gluon fusion through a technifermion loop , as a source of technipion production .",
    "here we report our results for technipions in the 110 - 145 gev mass range where direct comparison with higgs production is possible .",
    "we consider final states with pairs of photons or tau leptons , since the lhc experiments have reported limits on the standard model higgs boson in both channels .",
    "first , we show the limits derived from the cms and atlas searches for a standard model higgs boson decaying to @xmath0 in figure [ fig : hgamgamenhancementlimit - logscale ] .",
    "the multiscale @xcite , tcsm low - scale @xcite , and isotriplet @xcite models predict rates of technipion production and decay to diphotons that exceed the experimental limits in this mass range even for the smallest possible size of the technicolor gauge group ( larger @xmath19 produces a higher rate ) .",
    "note that we took the value of the technifermion hypercharge parameter @xmath42 in the isotriplet model to have the value @xmath48 for purposes of illustration ; choosing @xmath62 could make this model consistent with the di - photon data for @xmath5 , but that would not affect the limits from the di - tau channel discussed below . for the original @xcite and variant @xcite one - family models ,",
    "the data still allow @xmath5 over the whole mass range , and @xmath63 is possible for 115 gev @xmath64 120 gev ; even 135 @xmath64 145 gev is marginally consistent with the data for @xmath65 in the original one - family model .",
    "+   +     +   +    the limits from the the cms and atlas searches for a standard model higgs boson decaying to @xmath66 in the same mass range are even more stringent , as shown in figure [ fig : htautauenhancementlimit - logscale ] .",
    "the data again exclude the multiscale @xcite , tcsm low - scale @xcite , and isotriplet @xcite models across the full mass range and for any size of the technicolor gauge group .",
    "the original @xcite is likewise excluded ; only @xmath67 gev for @xmath5 is even marginally consistent with data . the variant @xcite one - family model is marginally consistent with data for @xmath5 but excluded for all higher values of @xmath19 .",
    "forthcoming lhc data on @xmath1 final states should provide further insight on these two models for @xmath5 .",
    "+   +    we now consider technipions that are too heavy to be directly compared with a higgs in the lhc data , but which can be directly constrained by looking at data from final states with tau - lepton pairs .",
    "atlas has obtained @xcite limits on the product of the production cross section with the branching ratio to tau pairs at @xmath68 confidence level for a generic scalar boson in the mass range @xmath69 gev .",
    "we use this limit to constrain technicolor models as follows .",
    "the production cross section @xmath70 for technicolor models can be estimated by scaling from the standard model at several values of the higgs mass can be obtained from the handbook @xcite . ] using the production enhancement factor calculated for each technicolor model @xcite . and",
    "the branching fraction of the technipions into tau pairs is shown in table ii , above .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 our comparison of the experimental limits with the model predictions is shown in figure [ fig : xsbrgghtautauatlastau - log ] .    in the region of the figures to the left of the vertical bar , we see that the data excludes technipions in the mass range from 145 gev up to nearly @xmath72 in all models for @xmath4 .",
    "for the multiscale and isotriplet models , @xmath5 is excluded as well in this mass range ; for the tcsm low - scale model , @xmath5 is excluded up to nearly 300 gev ( the few points that are allowed at low mass on this plot are excluded by the data shown in figures 2 and 3 ) ; while for the original and variant one - family models , @xmath5 can be consistent with data at these higher masses .",
    "again , further lhc data on di - tau final states will be valuable for discerning whether the models with only two technicolors remain viable . at present ,",
    "technicolor models with colored technifermions are strongly constrained even if their lightest technipion is just below the threshold at which it can decay to top - quark pairs .    moreover , as the region of the figures to the right of the vertical bar demonstrates , the data also impacts technipions in the mass range above @xmath3 in some cases : @xmath73 gev ( 375 gev ) is excluded for any size technicolor group in the multiscale ( isotriplet ) model and @xmath74 gev is excluded for @xmath4 in the tcsm low - scale model .",
    "note that these limits apply only in cases where the technipion has a very small branching fraction into top quarks , and the branching fraction to di - taus just varies smoothly with the increasing mass of the technipion .",
    "as we shall discuss shortly , such limits on technipions heavier than @xmath3 would not hold in models where the extended technicolor dynamically generates the bulk of the top quark mass and the technipion has an appreciable top - quark branching fraction .",
    "+   +    we will now illustrate how the above constraints are modified in theories where the top - quark s mass includes a substantial contribution from extended technicolor .",
    "in such models , the etc coupling between the top quark and technipion can be relatively large , which has several consequences .",
    "first , it means that for technipions heavy enough to decay to top - quark pairs that channel will dominate , so that the branching fractions to @xmath66 and @xmath0 become negligible .",
    "so these models can be constrained by the lhc data discussed in this paper only for @xmath75 .",
    "second , it implies that charged technipions @xmath76 that are lighter than the top quark can open a new top - quark decay path : @xmath77 .",
    "existing bounds on this decay rate preclude charged technipions lighter than about 160 gev ; for simplicity , we will take this to be an effective lower bound on the mass of our neutral technipions in our discussion here  though , in principle , it is possible for the neutral technipion to be lighter than its charged counterpart . based on these considerations , we will be considering possible lhc bounds on technipions with substantial coupling to top quarks and lying in the mass range 160 gev @xmath78 ; at present only data on di - tau final states exists for this mass range .    within this mass range ,",
    "the presence of a large top - technipion coupling allows gluon fusion through a top - quark loop ( as in figure 1(c ) ) to become a significant source of technipion production .",
    "extrapolating from the expressions for decay of a pseudoscalar boson in @xcite , one finds that the decay of technipion @xmath20 to gluons through a top - quark loop has the rate : @xmath79 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the etc - mediated top - quark coupling to technipions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : higgs - tau ] ) and ( [ eq : fftau ] ) , and the expression @xmath83\\rightarrow 1 $ ] in the limit of large top - quark mass . comparing this with eqn .",
    "( [ eq : techni - glu ] ) , we see that the ratio @xmath84 } { n_{tc } { \\cal a}_{gg}}\\right)^2 \\equiv \\left ( r^{loops } \\right)^2\\ ] ] can be substantial if @xmath85 and @xmath19 is small .",
    "the relative sign of the techniquark loop and top - quark loop contributions depends on the structure of the etc sector of the theory . in models where this sign is positive",
    ", the top - quark and techniquark amplitudes will add constructively and the limits derived in the previous section will be strengthened .",
    "however , in models where the relative sign is negative , the diagrams in figure 1(a ) and 1(c ) will interefere destructively , reducing the rate of technipion production calculated in the previous section by a factor of @xmath86 that has the potential to weaken the bounds from the lhc data .",
    "moreover , in a technicolor model where both @xmath19 and @xmath33 are relatively small , for light technipion masses where @xmath87 , the ratio @xmath88 can be greater than one , meaning that the top - quark loop can contribute more to technipion production than the techniquark loop . for heavier technipion masses ,",
    "the relative importance of the top - quark loop declines , and the two contributions interfere strongly , so that the production rate declines and the limits from lhc data become much weaker . for still heavier technipion masses ,",
    "the techniquark loop begins to dominate again and the interference loses its impact on the strength of the bounds .",
    "this behavior is visible in figure [ fig : xsbrgghtautauatlastau - log - lambda-0 - 5 ] , which shows how the limits on the @xmath5 version of each model would be affected by the presence of top - quark loops with @xmath89 .",
    "the data , shaded region , and model prediction curve are as in figure [ fig : xsbrgghtautauatlastau - log ] , for the mass range 160 gev @xmath90 . also shown here",
    "is a hatched region that illustrates how the model curve would move upwards ( downwards ) in the presence of constructive ( destructive ) interference between the top and technifermion loops .",
    "the destructive interference would have little impact on the constraint the lhc data places upon the multiscale model , and progressively greater impact on the viability of the @xmath91 versions of the isotriplet , tcsm low - scale , and original one - family models . in the variant one - family model",
    ", we see that the contribution from the top loop would , as discussed above , dominate at lower @xmath92 , cancel the techniquark loop contribution at @xmath93 gev ( so that the expected cross - section would vanish ) , and then diminish in size for larger @xmath92 .",
    "we have also explored the impact of top loop contributions with @xmath89 on the @xmath94 versions of the models , where the value of @xmath88 would be smaller by a factor of two .",
    "we find that destructive interference from top loops would leave the lhc data s exclusion of technipions intact across the range 160 gev @xmath95 in the multiscale model , would bring the upper end of the excluded range down to 325 gev ( 300 gev , 250 gev ) in the isotriplet ( tcsm low - scale , variant one - family ) model from the value of @xmath72 shown in figure [ fig : xsbrgghtautauatlastau - log ] , and bring the upper range of the excluded range down to about 250 gev from the previous 325 gev ( per figure [ fig : xsbrgghtautauatlastau - log ] ) in the original one - family model .",
    "the impact on models with even larger values of @xmath19 would be proportionately smaller .",
    "finally , we note that if data were available for di - photon final states in the applicable mass range , it would be possible to discern the impact of destructive interference between top and technifermion loops on the data s ability to constrain the models . in this case",
    ", one would need to include effects of top - quark loops both on technipion production from gluon fusion and also on technipion decay to two photons .",
    "in this paper we have used the lhc limits on the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite decay modes of a standard model higgs boson to constrain the technipion states predicted in technicolor models with colored technifermions . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the technipions tend to produce larger signals in both channels than @xmath8 would , so that this is an effective way of constraining such technicolor models .",
    "because the technipions are spinless , just like the standard model higgs boson , the di - photon and di - tau final states resulting from decay of the produced boson would have the same kinematic properties , so there should be no change in the efficiencies and acceptances .",
    "hence , it is possible to adapt the limits quoted by the collaborations for the higgs searches very directly to technicolor models with colored technifermions .",
    "we have found that the combined limits on higgs bosons decaying to di - photon or di - tau final states from the atlas and cms collaborations exclude at 95% cl the presence of technipions in the mass range from 110 gev nearly up to @xmath3 for any of the representative models considered here for @xmath4 .",
    "even if one takes @xmath5 to make the production rate as small as possible , the multiscale @xcite and isotriplet @xcite models are excluded up to @xmath72 ; the tcsm low - scale @xcite is excluded for technipion masses up to nearly 300 gev ; and the original @xcite and variant @xcite one - family model are only marginally consistent with data .",
    "the implication for technicolor model building is clear : models with light technipions and colored technifermions are not allowed by the lhc data , except possibly in a few models with @xmath5 .",
    "model - builders will need to consider scenarios with heavier pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons or theories in which the technifermions are color - neutral .",
    "moreover , we have also seen that the atlas limits on a scalar decaying to @xmath66 constrain the presence of technipions in the mass range @xmath96 450 gev if the technipion decays only negligibly to top quarks  as in models where the top quark s mass is being generated by a topcolor @xcite sector instead of by extended technicolor .",
    "the excluded mass range extends to 450 gev ( 375 gev ) for a multi scale ( isotriplet ) technicolor sector for any value of @xmath19 and reaches 375 gev for a tcsm low - scale technicolor sector with @xmath4 .",
    "hence , starting from these technicolor sectors , building a topcolor - assisted technicolor @xcite model would now require ensuring that the technipions have masses above 375 - 450 gev .",
    "this complements recent lhc searches for @xmath97 that exclude the top - higgs state of tc2 models for masses below 300 gev if the associated top - pion has a mass of 150 gev ( the lower bound rises to 380 gev if the top - pion mass is at least 400 gev ) @xcite .    in principle , there are several ways to construct technicolor models that could reduce the scope of these limits . as discussed earlier , one possibility is to arrange for the extended technicolor sector to provide a large fraction of the top quark s mass ( though it would be necessary to find a new way to evade bounds on fcnc and weak isospin violation ) . in this case ,",
    "gluon fusion through a top - quark loop ( as in figure 1(c ) ) could provide an alternative production mechanism for the technipions .",
    "if the etc structure of the model caused the top - quark and techniquark loop amplitudes to interfere constructively , our bounds would be strengthened ; but , as illustrated in figure 5 , in a model where the interference was destructive , our limits on the technipion mass could be weakened , at least for small values of @xmath19 .    another possibility is to build a technicolor model that includes technipions but not colored technifermions ; various aspects of its collider phenomenology have been predicted , for instance , in @xcite ] . in order for extended technicolor to provide mass to the quarks , color",
    "must then be embedded in the etc group alongside technicolor , and some etc gauge bosons will carry color charge .",
    "it would be more difficult to use the lhc data discussed here to set broadly - applicable limits on technipions appearing in such models .",
    "the production mechanism contributing most strongly to the rate for the states we studied would not be operative ; that is , without colored technifermions , the process illustrated in figure 1(a ) would be absent . the analogous process with top quarks instead of colored technifermions in the loop ( as in figure 1(c ) ) could , in principle , contribute , but there will be no loop - derived enhancement by @xmath19 as in the diagram of figure 1(a ) . if the coupling of the top quarks to the technipion were large , that could provide an enhancement to replace the missing @xmath19 factor  but , as we have seen , the coupling is highly model - dependent . and , as mentioned earlier , building a model where etc provides most of the top quark mass ( and the top - technipion coupling is large ) remains an open challenge , because it is hard to accomplish this without contravening experimental limits on flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite or isospin violation @xcite .    a third option would be to base a model around a technicolor sector devoid of technipions , such as the original one - doublet model of @xcite or a modern  next - to - minimal \" walking technicolor model with technifermions in the symmetric tensor representation of technicolor and @xmath63 @xcite . of course",
    ", these models come with their own complexities and challenges .",
    "this first set of lhc data has excluded a large class of technicolor and topcolor - assisted technicolor models that include colored technifermions  unless the technipions states can be made relatively heavy or the extended technicolor sector can be arranged to cause interference between top - quark and techniquark loops .",
    "model builders will need to either identify specific technicolor theories able to withstand the limits discussed here , while generating the top quark mass without excessive weak isospin violation or fcnc , or else seek new directions for a dynamical explanation of the origin of mass .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that additional lhc data that gives greater sensitivity to new scalars decaying to @xmath66 or that addresses scalars with masses over 145 gev decaying to @xmath0 could quickly probe models down to the minimum number of technicolors and up to higher technipion masses .",

    "<S> lhc searches for the standard model higgs boson in @xmath0 or @xmath1 decay modes place strong constraints on the light top - pion state predicted in technicolor models that include colored technifermions . compared with the standard higgs boson , the top - pions have an enhanced production rate ( largely because the technipion decay constant is smaller than the weak scale ) and also enhanced branching ratios into di - photon and di - tau final states ( largely due to the suppression of @xmath2 decays of the technipions ) . </S>",
    "<S> these factors combine to make the technipions more visible in both channels than a standard model higgs would be . hence , the recent atlas and cms searches for higgs bosons exclude the presence of technipions with masses from 110 gev to nearly @xmath3 in technicolor models that ( a ) include colored technifermions ( b ) feature topcolor dynamics and ( c ) have technicolor groups with three or more technicolors ( @xmath4 ) . for certain models , </S>",
    "<S> the limits also apply out to higher technipion masses or down to the minimum number of technicolors ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the limits may be softened somewhat in models where extended technicolor plays a significant role in producing the top quark s mass . </S>",
    "<S> additional lhc data on di - tau and di - photon final states will be extremely valuable in further exploring technicolor parameter space . </S>"
