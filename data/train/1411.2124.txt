    "during last decades investigations of the response of charged polymers , so - called polyelectrolytes , to external electric field attracted much scientific attention .",
    "@xcite in particular , the application of novel experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy , which can explore the behaviour of a single chain , provided new insight into the problem.@xcite if the free end of a grafted polyelectrolyte is under load , while the chain itself is exposed to electric field that favours its adsorption , the configuration of the chain is determined by both the field and the force applied to the free end.@xcite in particular , the force may arise if the chain is mechanically coupled to a deformable , nano - sized object , such as another polymer chain or a colloidal particle .",
    "any deformation of the object ( target body ) gives rise to a restoring force ( see fig .",
    "the force and the length of the bulk polymer segment , i.e. , the part pulled off from the adsorption layer , are determined in a self - regulated manner :  the larger the field the stronger the attraction of the polyelectrolyte to the surface and the shorter becomes the bulk piece of the chain . due to the mechanical coupling , however , shrinking of the bulk",
    "part induces increasing deformation of the target body which results in an enlarged restoring force .",
    "therefore , varying the external field one can control chain configuration and generated force . the latter crucially depends on the mechanical properties of the target body , i.e. , on its response to deformation .",
    "qualitatively , one can have either linear response , like for a linear spring that models small deformations of a coiled polymer , or nonlinear one , as for strongly stretched chains or squeezed colloidal particles , see fig .",
    "1 and fig .  2 .",
    "such polyelectolyte - based setups can be utilised to generate mechanical force regulated by external electrical field .",
    "there are numerous possible applications of the mechanism , ranging from nano - scale devices , designed to fix nano - sized objects ( `` nano - vice '' ) , up to much larger meso- or marco - scales such as artificial muscles . from a fundamental point of view , as well as with respect to possible applications ,",
    "two questions are of a primary interest :  ( i ) how does the force generated depend on field strength and elastic properties of the target body ?",
    "( ii ) how does the chain configuration alter with varying electric field ?",
    "the analysis of these problems may be also important in the context of the efficiency of future nano - devices such as a vice - like one suitable to fix nano - sized objects    in our model the non - anchored end of a grafted polyelectrolyte chain is linked to a deformable target body that is modelled by various types of springs both linear and non - linear ones .",
    "perpendicular to the grafting plane a variable electric field is applied that favours polyelectrolyte adsorption .",
    "moreover the field drives counterions away from the polyelectrolyte up to the top boundary . as a result , at zero electrical current the counterion subsystem is practically decoupled from polyelectrolyte provided the specific volume per chain is large enough .    in a previous study",
    "@xcite we investigated theoretically as well as by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) the effect of a constant force which pulls the polyelectrolyte chain away from the adsorption plane .",
    "we analysed the case of zero electrical current and found a very good agreement between theoretical prediction and simulation results .",
    "there , we presented also first simulation results on force generation for chains linked to a target body .",
    "for that problem , however , no analytical theory has been given .",
    "in the present paper we report both extensive md simulation results and a theoretical study of the generation of mechanical force by external electrical field .",
    "a few different force - deformation relations of the target body have been explored . in particular , we analyse linear , non - linear ( cubic ) and hertzian springs , that mimic coiled gaussian chains , strongly stretched chains and squeezed colloidal particles , respectively .",
    "we present a analytical theory which is in a good agreement with the simulation results .",
    "in addition to the studies with zero current at equilibrium , we performed simulations where a finite current across the box is allowed and found that the impact of current on chain configuration and response force is negligible for the parameter range addressed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section , we give details of the numerical setup and present simulation results .",
    "the analytical theory is introduced in section 3 and subsequently we compare our theoretical predictions with simulation data .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarise our findings .",
    "in the simulations reported the polyelectrolyte is modelled by a freely jointed bead - spring chain of length @xmath0 which is anchored by one uncharged end - bead to a planar surface at @xmath1 .",
    "all the remaining @xmath2 beads carry one ( negative ) elementary charge . to satisfy electroneutrality , @xmath2 monovalent free counterions of opposite charge",
    "are added . for simplicity ,",
    "they are treated as particles of the same size as monomers .",
    "the implicit solvent is assumed to be a good one modelled by a short - ranged , purely repulsive interaction between all particles .",
    "we describe it by a shifted lennard - jones potential . along the chain ,",
    "neighbouring beads are connected by a finitely extensible , nonlinear elastic fene potential . with our choice of parameters , at zero force we obtain a bond length @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lennard - jones parameter .",
    "all particles except the anchor bead are exposed to a short - ranged repulsive interaction with the grafting plane at @xmath1 and with the upper boundary at @xmath5 .",
    "all the charged entities interact with the bare coulomb potential the strength of which is fixed by the bjerrum length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the elementary charge , @xmath8 is the dielectric constant of the medium , @xmath9 is temperature and @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant . in the simulations we set @xmath11 and",
    "use a langevin thermostat to hold the temperature @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the lennard - jones energy parameter .",
    "details of simulation model and method can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the free chain end is linked to a target body that is modelled by springs of different force - deformation relations : ( i ) linear spring , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the response force , @xmath16 is the strength of the spring , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the lengths of deformed and undeformed spring , respectively .",
    "such a force - deformation relation mimics , e.  g. , the behaviour of a polymer chain in a coiled gaussian state .",
    "( ii ) nonlinear spring , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , which models a stiffer body , e.  g. , a chain in an intermediate state between the coiled and stretched one . ( iii ) hertzian force @xmath21 , which corresponds to the force - deformation relation for a squeezed colloidal particle of a diameter @xmath22.@xcite note that there are two different setups where the spring is anchored either a ) at the top wall ( see fig . 1 , left panels ) or b ) at the grafting plane ( see fig.1 , right panels and fig.2 . in our model",
    ", we assume that ( i ) the anchor of a spring is fixed and ( ii ) the spring is oriented perpendicular to the wall .",
    "hence , the instantaneous length of the spring is given by a ) @xmath23 or b ) @xmath24 , respectively , where @xmath25 is the box height in @xmath26-direction and @xmath27 is the @xmath26-coordinate of the end segment of the polyelectrolyte linked to the target body .",
    "in this paper , we report simulation results obtained for polyelectrolytes of total chain lengths @xmath28 320 .",
    "the footprint of the simulation box is @xmath29 = 424 @xmath30 424 ( in units of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the box height is @xmath32 = 160 , i.e. , both the effective surface charge density of grafting plane and box height are identical to those chosen in our previous study.@xcite note that previously we studied equilibrium properties but neglected any current across the box which could , however , reduce the force generated and limit the efficiency of possible nano - devices . in the present study , in addition to equilibrium properties we checked the effect of a finite current which is treated by the following simple model : counterions coming close to the top boundary",
    "are removed with a finite probability @xmath33 and reinserted just above the bottom boundary .",
    "the average current density @xmath34 in this model is linearly related to the probability @xmath33 as @xmath35 , where the constant @xmath36 may be expressed in terms of the average counterion density in the top layer and the simulation time - step . , where @xmath37 is the thickness of the top layer from which counterions are removed",
    ", @xmath38 is the average density of counterions in this layer , and @xmath39 is the simulation time step . hence the constant @xmath36 reads , @xmath40 for the purposes of the present study we do not need its value .",
    "varying @xmath33 from zero ( vanishing current ) to a maximal value of @xmath41 we alter the electric current and cover all possible bulk distributions of counterions that range from strong accumulation near the upper plane ( cathode ) to homogeneous distributions across the whole box height ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . as shown below in detail ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , we find that the influence of a finite current is practically negligible .",
    "this behaviour occurs probably because of the very low bulk density of counterions in our setup .",
    "moreover , while for small current almost all counterions are accumulated in the upper layer close to cathode leaving the polyelectrolyte unscreened , at larger currents counterions move rather fast and are not able to screen the polymer charge efficiently .",
    "although hydrodynamic interactions are not present in the simulation model used , we expect that the basic behaviour would quantitatively persist also in a refined dynamic model . as the result and in sharp contrast to the field - free case,@xcite the counterion subsystem is practically decoupled from the polyelectrolyte which drastically simplifies the theoretical analysis . a typical simulation snapshot at vanishing current is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we find that already at relatively weak fields , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 being the monomer charge , the adsorbed part of the polyelectrolyte exhibits an almost two - dimensional structure , with small loops , rising out of the plane up to a hight of about a monomer radius . at the same time , the pulled - off bulk part is strongly stretched along the direction of the force and the polymer bonds are almost perfectly aligned perpendicular to the grafting plane .",
    "simulation results are shown in figs .  4 - 7 and discussed along with the corresponding theoretical predictions in sec .",
    "the total free energy of the system @xmath44 can be written as a function of the number of desorbed chain monomers in bulk , @xmath45 .",
    "it consists of a few contributions @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the free energy of the bulk part of the chain , i.e. , of the desorbed part , @xmath48 is the free energy of the adsorbed part , which depends on the number of adsorbed monomers @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the mechanical energy of the target body modelled by a spring .",
    "the bulk free energy @xmath47 is calculated as the sum of two contributions , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 corresponds to the interaction of the desorbed part of the chain with the external field @xmath53 and @xmath54 accounts for the self - interaction of the bulk part , i.e. , for the electrostatic interaction between charged monomers . for strongly stretched chains , i.e. ,",
    "chains under strong stress , the entropic component of the bulk part can be neglected and @xmath55 equals the energy of a charged chain in electric field @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the distance of the @xmath58-th chain monomer from grafting plane and @xmath59 is the monomer charge . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_bulk0 ] ) , we ignore counterion screening of the chain as well as of the boundary planes ( which is justified for our setup , see the discussion above ) and approximate the electrostatic potential as @xmath60 , where @xmath53 is the ( constant ) electric field in @xmath26-direction . for simplicity , we neglect bond stretching and assume that for strongly aligned chains all bonds are directed in vertical direction ( see fig .",
    "then the height of the @xmath58-th monomer can be written @xmath61 which allows to sum up @xmath62 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_bulk0 ] ) yields @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 where we take into account the negative sign of @xmath66 ( for the assumed positive field @xmath53 ) . for stretched chains",

    ", we write @xmath74 where @xmath75 for setup a ) ( linear and non - linear springs ) and @xmath76 for setup b ) ( hertzian spring ) , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . furthermore ,",
    "in the above equation we use again the relation @xmath68 . applying the latter equation to the case of hertzian springs one has to add an additional factor @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the heaviside step - function , skipped here for brevity .",
    "this factor reflects the particular feature that hertzian springs respond only to compression . for a harmonic spring one",
    "has @xmath81 and a linear force - deformation relation .",

    "the second term is purely entropic , giving the entropy of an uncharged two - dimensional chain the gyration radius of which is @xmath83 .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the probability @xmath88 that a chain of @xmath89 monomers has a gyration radius @xmath83 , so that @xmath90 gives the total number of such chain configurations . for two - dimensional chains and under the condition @xmath91 , @xmath88 reads@xcite @xmath92",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : surface ] ) interactions of the adsorbed part of the chain with the electric field are neglected .",
    "minimising @xmath93 with respect to the radius of gyration @xmath83 , we find that @xmath94 which justifies the application of eq .",

    "( [ eq : eq_for_n ] ) numerically , we obtain the equilibrium number of desorbed monomers of the chain @xmath99 which yields the force @xmath103 generated by the applied electric field @xmath53 following the relation @xmath104 theoretical results of force @xmath103 as a function of applied field are shown in figs . 4 and 5 , where we compare them directly with md data .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the result obtained by the ambitious statistical physics approach presented above is very close to the prediction of a purely mechanical theory , based on the force balance between the electrostatic force acting on the bulk part of the spring , @xmath105 and the force from the spring @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the equilibrium number of desorbed monomers estimated by the mechanical theory . for linear springs , i.e. , at @xmath109 eq .",
    "( [ eq : mechan ] ) can be solved analytically and the simple mechanical theory yields @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : mech_theo ] ) shows both the explicit dependence of generated force on electric field @xmath53 and bare spring length @xmath112 .",
    "because the deviations from the simple mechanical theory are small , one can linearise eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_for_n ] ) around @xmath108 . considering only terms linear in @xmath113",
    "we obtain the following corrections to generated force @xmath114 for the parameter range addressed here , the correction @xmath115 is rather small , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "this circumstance explains the surprising accuracy of the purely mechanical theory .",
    "upon desorption of a finite number of monomers and transformation of the corresponding surface piece of the chain into a bulk one several contributions to the total free energy compensate each other .",
    "thus , finally the behaviour is dominated by the purely mechanical balance between the two leading forces acting on the chain , i.e. , on the one hand that by the electric field and on the other hand that by the target body ( spring ) . for various applications , it would be convenient to have an approximate relation that expresses explicitly the generated force in terms of applied field and geometric parameters of the system . for linear springs ,",
    "such a relation is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mech_theo ] ) . for small fields @xmath117 , one can obtain a similar result also for the general case of a non - linear force - deformation law . using the approximate force balance equation ( [ eq : mechan ] ) in the form",
    "@xmath118 one can iteratively solve it for @xmath108 .",
    "with zero - order approximation @xmath119 , we obtain @xmath120 applying the relation for the force @xmath121 , finally we get @xmath122 which is supposed to be valid for small electric fields , @xmath123 . in fig . 7 ,",
    "the above dependence is compared with simulation data .",
    "in figs .  4  7 we compare the predictions of our theory with the results of md simulations . in the cases of linear and non - linear springs , see fig .",
    "4 , as well as for hertzian springs , see fig .  5 , the agreement between theory and numerical data is rather good . moreover , we find that the simulation results obey quite well the purely mechanical theory .",
    "evaluating correction terms within the statistical mechanics approach , it becomes evident that they effectively compensate each other for the parameter range addressed in the present study .",
    "this particular feature may be important for applications because the simple theory yields useful estimates of the generated force as a function of applied field and equilibrium spring length , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mech_theo ] ) and ( [ eq : f_l0 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the generated force depends almost linearly on the equilibrium spring length not only for linear springs , which corresponds to coiled gaussian chains , but also for non - linear , hertzian springs ( see fig .  7 ) which model a squeezed colloidal particles where the equilibrium length @xmath112 corresponds to the particle diameter @xmath124 . from our previous simulations,@xcite",
    "we can conclude that the response force is almost independent of the total chain length @xmath125 .",
    "another important observation refers to the impact of ( undesired ) electric current , caused by the applied electric field , on the force generated .",
    "simulations performed with hertzian springs for different current strengths clearly demonstrate that the influence of current on the magnitude of the force is almost negligible , see fig .",
    "this behaviour may be explained as follows : for small currents , almost all counterions accumulate near the plane oppositely charged to the grafting plane , in this way leaving the grafted chain unscreened .",
    "for large currents , counterions move rather fast and are not able to screen efficiently .",
    "note that weak impact of electric current on generated force is another necessary condition for the application of the simple mechanical theory .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied theoretically and by means of md simulations the force generation ( response force ) by an external electric field in a system built up of a grafted polyelectrolyte chain with the free end linked to a target body .",
    "we study several force - deformation relations that specify the mechanical properties of target bodies .",
    "in particular we analyse linear response which mimics coiled polymer chains , non - linear ( cubic ) response corresponding to semi - stretched chains and hertzian force - deformation relation that reflects the behaviour of squeezed colloidal particles .",
    "we observe that field - controlled mechanical force the magnitude of which depends on system parameters such as spring stiffness and equilibrium spring length can be generated in a rather wide interval while the electric field is varied only moderately .",
    "we develop a theory that describes the phenomenon within a statistical mechanics framework .",
    "its predictions agree quite well with simulation results .",
    "we demonstrate that due to the mutual compensation of different contributions to the total free energy , a purely mechanical theory based on simple force balance arguments may be accurately applied for the parameter range considered in the study .",
    "since the full theory can be solved only numerically we also present a simplified approach which gives useful approximate relations for the dependence of generated force on various parameters . to check the impact of undesired electric current across the setup",
    ", we performed simulations partially both at zero current and at finite current strength : no noticeable impact of current on the generated force has been detected . note that in the presence of additional salt ions ( not considered here ) the system boundaries acting as electrodes become",
    "increasingly polarised which reduces the effective field acting on the polyelectrolyte .",
    "we expect , however , that for small salt concentration and strong electric field this effect would not qualitatively change the phenomena addressed .",
    "the systems studied may be treated as prototypes of possible nano - devices where the force acting on a target body can be regulated by external electric field .",
    "nano - nippers or nano - vice designed on the basis of the explored phenomenon and operated by external electric field , could be possibly used to reversibly fix and release nano - sized objects ."
