    "it has been identified in many kinds of materials , including magnetic metals , @xcite magnetic semiconductors , @xcite magnetic insulators , @xcite and nonmagnetic materials with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite    the real breakthrough is made by the observation of sse in magnetic insulators , @xcite which has clearly uncovered that , distinct from spin - dependent seebeck effect in metallic materials , sse possesses the unique ability to generate a pure flow of spin angular momentum by mere thermal excitations without moving charge carriers .",
    "the thermal - generated pure spin current is carried by excitations of the magnetization , known as magnons , instead of by moving charges .",
    "this is an advantage because charge carriers are often problematic for the thermal design of devices , of which the issue can be avoided by the sse in insulating magnets without conducting charge currents .",
    "it allows us to construct efficient thermoelectric devices upon new principles @xcite and to realize robust , nondissipative information transmission and energy transfer @xcite in the absence of joule heating .",
    "therefore , the sse is expected to act as a new method facilitating the functional use of `` waste '' heat and opens a new possibility of spintronics , @xcite magnonics , @xcite and spin caloritronics , @xcite and thus has ignited a new upsurge of research interest @xcite in these fields .    [ 0.45 ] the magnonic spin current is easily flowing from left to right but for @xmath0 the magnonic spin current from right to left is severely suppressed and even prohibited .",

    "sse in a metal - insulating magnetic interface system , @xcite where the spin transfer is assisted by the interface electron - magnon inelastic scattering .",
    "it was shown that with the interfacial electron - magnon coupling , reversing the thermal bias is able to give asymmetric spin currents , and increasing thermal bias across the interface abnormally gives an increasing spin current .",
    "@xcite in this work , we study the nonequilibrium transport for the asymmetric and negative differential magnon tunneling driven by temperature bias . we demonstrate in magnon tunneling junctions that the rectification and negative differential sse emerge as a consequence of the magnon - magnon interaction that makes the magnonic spectrum _ temperature - dependent_. this mechanism is different from the one underlying the asymmetric and negative differential sses in metal - magnetic insulator interfaces  @xcite that needs the _ energy - dependent _ electronic spectrum .",
    "we also illustrate the concept of spin seebeck transistor based on the negative differential sse .",
    "the rectification and negative differential electronic transports are fundamental for realizing functional electronic diodes and transistors , which are building blocks of modern electronics .",
    "similarly , the rectification of heat flux and negative differential thermal conductance  @xcite are also crucial for designing heat diodes and transistors that are as well the fundamental building blocks of phononics .",
    "@xcite thus , we believe our results are relevant for constructing magnonic and spin caloritronic circuits with efficient spin seebeck diodes and transistors , which could play crucial roles in controlling energy and information in magnonics @xcite and spin caloritronics .",
    "@xcite    we summarize the transport theory of magnon tunneling in a spin tunneling junction in sec .",
    "we point out in sec .",

    "the magnonic spin tunneling junction consists of three parts : when putting together the left and right insulating magnetic segments , the central interface will be formed , which may result from the lattice mismatch , the vacuum , and the depleted- or nonmagnetic regime that acting as the tunneling barrier [ see fig . [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath1    the left and right insulating magnetic materials , in the low temperature or large spin size limit , are well described by the noninteracting magnon model @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators of the magnon with momentum @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 at the left ( right ) segments .",
    "these field operators satisfy the commutation relations for bosons .",
    "the left and right magnons are assumed at their own equilibriums with temperature @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "note that since we are interested in the sse where the pure spin current is induced by the mere temperature bias , we do not consider the possible chemical potential imbalance for the left and right magnons and set them both to zero . in the next section",
    "we will discuss more details , where many - body magnon interaction is included .",
    "for the tunneling part , the magnonic spin transfer is described by the tunneling matrix : @xmath9 which results from the exchange interaction across the interface .",
    "because this term could be small compared to other parts of the total hamiltonian , it is usually treated by the perturbation theory .",
    "physically , each magnon carries a unit spin angular momentum @xmath10 .",
    "the annihilation of a magnon at one side and the successive creation of a magnon at the other side correspond to the rising of the spin component at one side but lowering the spin component at the other side .",
    "in other words , the tunneling magnon current is equivalent to the pure spin down current if the magnetization of the material is defined as up . the tunneling magnon current operator @xmath11 through the interface is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the magnon number operators of the left and right segments , respectively .",
    "using the heisenberg s equation @xmath15=\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat h_i , \\hat n_v]$ ] , ( @xmath16 , we can express the tunneling magnon current operator as @xmath17 the magnonic spin current @xmath18 across the tunneling interface is the average value of the operator @xmath19 , which under the second - order perturbation of the tunneling matrix is calculated through @xmath20\\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are represented in the interaction picture , with @xmath23 . substituting the operator @xmath11 , we arrive at the single - magnon tunneling current @xmath24_{\\omega=0}=\\frac{i}{\\hbar^2}\\left[g_{\\mathrm{tot}}^r(\\omega)-g_{\\mathrm{tot}}^a(\\omega)\\right]_{\\omega=0},\\ ] ] where the retarded ( advanced ) green s function reads @xmath25 with @xmath26 \\rangle$ ] and @xmath27 .",
    "although this tunneling spin current is formulated in terms of the bosonic magnon tunneling and the bosonic green s functions are defined in a different way from the electronic ones due to the different ( anti)commutation relations , we note that it shares the same expression as for the standard result of fermionic electron tunneling .",
    "@xcite the green s functions are often calculated by evaluating equivalent matsubara functions of imaginary frequency and successively by the analytic continuation @xmath28 .",

    "( [ eq : is3 ] ) is still reminiscent of that for the electron tunneling .",
    "@xcite the only differences are that here the integral of magnon energy is from @xmath49 from @xmath50 instead of the energy range @xmath51 for electrons ; the magnon population is characterized by the bose - einstein distribution instead of the fermi - dirac distribution for electrons . by the substitutions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , eq .

    "it is necessary for both sides of the tunneling junction to have different responses to temperature change .",
    "therefore , we need to go beyond the noninteracting magnon picture so that the temperature - dependent dos becomes possible .      in many - body systems ,",
    "the ( nonlinear , higher order than quadratic ) interaction generally changes the energy spectrum . in terms of the language of green s functions",

    ", we generally have the different dos - overlaps ( or , say , different spectral - overlaps ) @xmath66 . as a result ,",
    "the reversed spin current will have different magnitudes under reversing thermal bias .",
    "if the density - overlap @xmath67 is much larger or smaller than @xmath68 , we will obtain a spin seebeck diode .",
    "that is , in one direction the temperature bias could produce a considerable spin current but in the opposite direction the temperature bias produces less spin current inefficiently , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    even if the left and right magnetic materials are identical , in some cases the density - overlap @xmath68 may decrease as increasing the thermal bias @xmath69 .",
    "when the decreasing of the density - overlap surpasses the increasing of @xmath70 $ ] , we will have the negative differential sse .",
    "that is , the magnonic spin current decreases with an increasing thermal bias .",
    "therefore , the many - body interaction induced temperature - dependence of the dos ( as well as the temperature - dependent spectral functions ) is the key to achieve the rectification and negative differential transport of spin current by controlling temperature bias .      in the following ,",
    "let us use a simple standard model to illustrate how the magnon - magnon interaction induces the temperature - dependent magnon energy @xcite that in turn leads to the possible spin seebeck diode . without loss of generality , we focus on the ferromagnets .",
    "the results and discussions are readily generalized to the antiferromagnets .",
    "@xcite    we first look into the left insulating magnetic material , which is conventionally described by a heisenberg lattice : @xmath71 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the raising ( lowering ) operator for the spin at site @xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes the nearest - neighbor bond with exchange coupling strength @xmath75 .",
    "this heisenberg exchange hamiltonian can be expanded in increasing powers of the magnon operators by the holstein - primakoff transformation , @xcite which maps the spin operators into bosonic magnons through @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the spin size of the left material .",
    "clearly , the creation ( annihilation ) of a magnon @xmath80 at site @xmath73 corresponds to that spin points less ( more ) in @xmath81 component so that each magnon carries an spin angular momentum of @xmath82 ( associated with a magnetic moment ) .",
    "thus , the tunneling magnons driven by temperature bias are responsible for the seebeck spin current .",
    "when keeping up to the lowest order of two - body magnon - magnon interaction , we have the truncated expansion : @xmath83 where we dropped an irrelevant constant term corresponding to the ground - state energy .",
    "since the holstein - primakoff transformation requires the constraint @xmath84 , the above expansion is justified , as in the large spin limit or low temperatures . after performing the fourier",
    "transform into the momentum space , one gets @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the total number of sites , @xmath87 denotes the nearest - neighbor vector , and the energy spectrum has the dispersion @xmath88 . to handle the two - body magnon interaction ,",
    "we adopt the standard mean - field approximation and keep the hartree - fock terms .",

    "therefore , more and stronger ( high - order ) magnon interactions are preferable for realizing efficient spin seebeck diode .      in the above example",
    ", we have illustrated that the possible spin seebeck diode effect can result from the temperature - dependent spectra induced by the magnon - magnon interaction with however temperature - independent exchange couplings .",
    "in fact , in real situations , the exchange interaction itself @xmath126 may be sensitive to temperature changes , which in turn also has the contribution to the spin seebeck diode effect . beside the exchange coupling",
    ", the dipolar interaction will have a similar effect .",
    "in particular , the dipolar interaction as well as the anisotropic exchange coupling usually opens a gap for the magnon spectrum , which thus makes the magnon gap temperature - dependent ; see refs . for experimental examples .",
    "the temperature - dependent magnon gap not only contributes to the spin seebeck diode effect but also makes the negative differential sse possible ; that is , increasing ( decreasing ) the thermal bias gives a decreasing ( increasing ) spin current .    as an example",

    "[ 0.5 ]    now , based on the negative differential sse , let us illustrate the concept of spin seebeck transistor following the spirit of phononics @xcite : similar to the electronic counterpart of a field - effect transistor ( fet ) , the spin seebeck transistor is composed of three parts : the source ( s ) , the gate ( g ) , and the drain ( d ) , as depicted in fig .

    ", the negative differential sse is crucial for realizing a spin seebeck transistor to amplify a spin current with a weak input signal , as the fet in modern electronics and the thermal transistor in phononics .",
    "in summary , we have studied the nonequilibrium transport for the asymmetric and negative differential magnon tunneling driven by temperature bias . we have demonstrated that in magnon tunneling junctions , the rectification and negative differential spin seebeck effects are emerging as a consequence of the many - body magnon interaction that makes the magnonic spectrum temperature - dependent , which are then used to build spin seebeck diodes and transistors .",
    "considering the fact that the magnon carries not only the spin angular momentum but also the energy [ see , e.g. , ref . ] , the present results further indicate the potential of a magnon tunneling junction acting as a thermal diode and/or a thermal transistor .",
    "although in calculations we normalized the number of spin at the interface , the size effect will not influence the asymmetric and negative differential magnon tunneling behaviors , but only affects the magnitude of the spin current .",
    "we can restore the interface size by denoting the number of spin at the tunneling interface as @xmath145 . in this way , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the tunneling spin current will be magnified as @xmath148 . therefore , in macroscopic magnon tunneling junctions , the spin current can be sufficiently large and much easier for measurements and applications .",
    "extension of the asymmetric and negative differential tunneling to phononics for the phonon diode and transistor @xcite is also possible , but should be done with care . although the phonon and magnon are both bosons , phonons have different physics in the real space compared to magnons . for phonons ,",
    "the left and right side can still be described by the free bosonic gas model as in eq .",

    "but the underlying mechanism should not change , that is , the many - body interaction induces temperature - dependent self - energies , which in turns makes the quasiparticle spectrum temperature - dependent . as a consequence , the rectification and negative differential thermal conductance will be emergent and the phonon diode and transistor become possible .",

    "<S> we study the nonequilibrium transport for the asymmetric and negative differential magnon tunneling driven by temperature bias . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the many - body magnon interaction that makes the magnonic spectrum temperature - dependent is the crucial factor for the emergence of rectification and negative differential spin seebeck effects in magnon tunneling junctions . </S>",
    "<S> when magnonic junctions have temperature - dependent density of states , reversing the temperature bias is able to give asymmetric spin currents and increasing temperature bias could give an anomalously decreasing magnonic spin current . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these properties are relevant for building spin seebeck diodes and transistors , which could play important roles in controlling information and energy in magnonics and spin caloritronics . </S>"
