    "recall that all the zero - modes in strained graphene are localized on one sublattice in the bulk , and on the other sublattice near the boundary of a finite system .",
    "therefore , both the nel and the ferromagnetic orders in strained graphene give rise to a finite local magnetization everywhere in the system .",
    "however , globally the two states may be distinguished .    due to the spatial separation of the zero - modes that are localized on different sublattices , the magnetization in the state with an equal sign of the nel order parameter in the entire system would need to change sign as one approaches the boundary from the bulk , so that the total magnetization could in fact vanish . in the truly ferromagnetic state , on the other hand , the sign of the magnetization in the bulk and the boundary would be the same , so that the system would develop an overall finite magnetization .",

    ", besides the splitting of the zero - energy subspace common to both orders , the nel order at the mean - field level pushes down in energy _ all _ the filled states below the chemical potential .",
    "in contrast , the ferromagnetic order parameter splits all the energy levels equally , half up and half down in energy , and therefore only lowers the energy of the half - filled zero - energy subspace . by spontaneously developing",

    "zero_-energy modes . in the very close vicinity of @xmath135 antiferromagnetic correlations are apparent and they rapidly give way to dominant ferromagnetic correlations . for the uniform , @xmath136 , axial field",
    "the extent of the dominant ferromagnetic correlations is considerably larger than for the localized one , @xmath137 .",
    "finally strong antiferromagnetic correlations are present at the edge of the flake . hence the overall features present in the quantum monte carlo calculations support the mean - field picture of the global edge - compensated antiferromagnetic spin structure .",
    "a more precise measure for the global edge - compensated antiferromagnetic state can be obtained by considering @xmath138 fig .",
    "[ qmc ] ( lower panel ) plots this quantity for the uniform and localized axial fields and at various values of @xmath139 . owing to the singlet nature of the ground state on finite lattices , @xmath140 , when @xmath141 exceeds the radius of the flake . in the absence of axial field ( @xmath142 ) only short range",

    "@xmath144 images the global edge - compensated antiferromagnetic spin structure . for the localized field",
    "the zero energy modes are localized around the center and @xmath143 quickly approaches a plateau value before being compensated by the edge antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "in contrast , for the uniform field @xmath143 builds up as a function of distance before being again compensated by the edge magnetism .    in fig .",
    "[ qmcu4 ] we consider larger values of @xmath145 . in the absence of the axial field , this choice of the hubbard interaction places us in the antiferromagnetic mott insulting phase , shown through the spin - spin correlation in fig.[qmcu4 ] ( top , left ) . as a consequence , and in comparison to the @xmath131 case , the integrated spin - spin correlations of eq.([s_r.eq ] ) show _ small _ fluctuations up to large distances .",
    "it is interesting to note that even starting from the mott insulating state , the axial field leads to the same reorganization of the spin - spin correlations as observed at weak couplings , shown in fig.[qmcu4 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "one will nevertheless observe substantial antiferromagnetic oscillations superimposed on the edge - compensated antiferromagnetic spin structure .",
    "the strain induced restructure of the spin - spin correlation for super - critical interactions ( @xmath145 ) is shown in fig.[qmcu4 ] ( top ) , for roughly uniform ( middle ) and localized ( right ) axial fields .",
    "to summarize , we proposed a specific modulation of the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes in honeycomb lattice that captures the coupling of the low - energy dirac quasi - particles to the ( time - reversal - symmetric ) axial magnetic fields . due to the presence of the axial magnetic field a finite number of states appears at ( near ) zero energy , which in turn enhances the effect of electron - electron interaction .",
    "various orderings can take place this way in strained graphene even at weak interactions.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we considered only the onsite hubbard interaction between the fermions , and studied the nature of the magnetic ground state in strained graphene . due to the special structure of the zero - energy states , which are supported by one sublattice in the bulk of the system , and by the other one near the boundary",
    ", the magnetic ground state in strained graphene lacks any analog in pristine graphene , or in graphene in true magnetic fields . through the numerical self - consistent hartree calculation , and a separate quantum monte carlo simulation , we established that the magnetic ground state gives rise to both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders , locally , everywhere in the system .",
    "although the antiferromagnetic order parameter is of the same sign in the entire system , the magnetization changes its sign near the boundary , so that the total magnetization is actually zero .",
    "such ordering takes place even for weak hubbard interactions .",
    "we named the magnetic ground state in strained graphene _ edge - compensated antiferromagnet_.    in contrast , the ground state of the hubbard model on honeycomb lattice subject to true magnetic fields ( and with the zeeman coupling ignored @xcite ) is the conventional nel antiferromagnet . through the self - consistent calculation",
    "we show that such nel ordering takes place again for weak interactions , and the order parameter closely resembles the profile of the true magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetization is in this case , however , identically zero everywhere in the system .",
    "the experimental detection of the global antiferromagnetic phase relies on the measurement of local magnetic moment everywhere in the system , as well as on the existence of the zero - energy states , particularly near the edge of the system .",
    "recent stm measurements in strained molecular graphene indicate the appearance of zero - modes in the bulk and close to the boundary of the system , which are indeed living on two different sublattices@xcite , in agreement with our numerical analysis ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the local magnetic moment , on the other hand , can be probed by either magnetic force microscope ( mfm ) or spin - polarized stm measurement .",
    "the latter method successfully established an anti - ferromagnetic ordering on monolayer fe , resting on tungsten@xcite , and revealed the spin structure inside a magnetic vortex core@xcite .",
    "a systematic measurement of the local magnetic moment using the spin - polarized stm may therefore also detect the unconventional magnetic ground state in strained graphene .",
    "the desired suppression of the real - time fluctuations of the local magnetic moment can be obtained either by increasing the system s size , or by increasing the size of the magnetic moments , which , as our analysis would suggest , can be achieved by enhancing the strength of the axial magnetic field and/or the strength of the onsite interaction .",
    "the latter can possibly be tuned to a certain degree in the molecular / artificial graphene .",
    "since the local ferromagnetic moment changes its sign roughly where the zero - modes loose their support on the a - sublattice , it is perhaps comparatively easier to detect the proposed global antiferromagnetic phase in strained graphene , when the axial magnetic field is localized near the center of the system .",
    "in that situation the ferromagnetic domain wall appears somewhere in the middle of the system ( see fig .  4 ) ,",
    "whereas , on the other hand , it would lie only very close to the boundary when the axial field is uniform ( see fig .",
