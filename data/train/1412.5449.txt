    "this is supported by the large @xmath133 measured by arpes@xcite as well as the small @xmath81 determined from our thermoelectric transport measurements .",
    "recently , feng _ et al._@xcite pointed out that linear dispersion of the dirac fermion survives inside the bulk gap only within a very small energy window , but it deforms in a larger momentum space away from the dirac points , resulting in a large effective mass ( see also in inset to fig .

    "to summarize , our electrical and thermoelectric transport measurements confirm the existence of a metallic surface state on the ( 011)-plane of smb@xmath0 .",
    "the metallic surface and insulating bulk conductances are well distinguished in the thermoelectric transport .",
    "our results demonstrate the important role played by kondo scattering in both bulk and surface conductances and also qualitatively imply the heavy effective mass of the surface state , indicating a new intrinsic feature of interaction - driven tkis due to the strong correlation effect in @xmath3-electron systems .",

    "<S> motivated by the high sensitivity to fermi surface topology and scattering mechanisms in magneto - thermoelectric transport , we have measured the thermopower and nernst effect on the ( 011)-plane of the proposed topological kondo insulator smb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments , together with electrical resistivity and hall effect measurements , suggest that the ( 011)-plane also harbors a metallic surface with an effective mass on the order of 10 - 10@xmath1 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the surface and bulk conductances are well distinguished in these measurements and are categorized into metallic and non - degenerate semiconducting regimes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> electronic correlations play an important role in enhancing scattering and also contribute to the heavy surface state . </S>"
