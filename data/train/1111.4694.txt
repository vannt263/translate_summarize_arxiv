    "according to the prevailing interpretation , our universe is dynamically dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath0 ( or a dynamical equivalent , called dark energy ( de ) ) which contributes more than 70% to the total cosmic energy budget .",
    "more than 20% are contributed by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and only about 5% are in the form of conventional , baryonic matter .",
    "because of the cosmological constant problem in its different facets , including the coincidence problem , a great deal of work was devoted to alternative approaches in which a similar dynamics as that of the @xmath0cdm model is reproduced with a time varying cosmological term , i.e. , the cosmological constant is replaced by a dynamical quantity . both dark matter ( dm ) and",
    "de manifest themselves so far only through their gravitational interaction .",
    "this provides a motivation for approaches in which dm and de appear as different manifestation of one single dark - sector component .",
    "the chaplygin - gas model@xcite and its generalizations@xcite realize this idea .",
    "unified models of the dark sector of this type are attractive since one and the same component behaves as pressureless matter at high redshifts and as a cosmological constant in the long time limit . while the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics for the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas ( gcg ) is well compatible with the data , the study of the perturbation dynamics resulted in problems which apparently ruled out all chaplygin - gas type models except those that are observationally almost indistinguishable from the @xmath0cdm model.@xcite to circumvent this problem , nonadiabatic perturbations were postulated and designed in a way to make the effective sound speed vanish . but",
    "this amounts to an ad hoc procedure which leaves open the physical origin of nonadiabatic perturbations .",
    "there exists , however , a different type of unified models of the dark sector , namely viscous cosmological models , which are intrinsically nonadiabatic.@xcite in the homogeneous and isotropic background a one - component viscous fluid shares the same dynamics as a gcg.@xcite now , what is observed in the redshift surveys is not the spectrum of the dark - matter distribution but the baryonic matter spectrum . including a baryon component into the perturbation dynamics for a universe with a chaplygin - gas dark sector",
    ", there appears the new problem that the unified chaplygin - gas scenario itself is disfavored by the data .",
    "it is only if the unified scenario with a fixed pressureless ( supposedly ) baryonic matter fraction of about @xmath1 ( according to the results from wmap and primordial nucleosynthesis ) is _ imposed _ on the dynamics , that consistency with the data is obtained.@xcite if the pressureless matter fraction is left free , its best - fit value is much larger than the baryonic fraction .",
    "in fact , it becomes even close to unity , leaving only a small percentage for the chaplygin gas , thus invalidating the entire scenario .",
    "in other words , a chaplygin - gas - based unified model of the dark sector is difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "one may ask now , whether the status of unified models can again be remedied by replacing the chaplygin gas by a viscous fluid .",
    "it is this question that we have investigated in refs .   and , which are summarized in this contribution .",
    "we studied the cosmological perturbation dynamics for a two - component model of baryons and a viscous fluid , where the latter represents a one - component description of the dark sector .",
    "we could show that such type of unified model is not only consistent for a fixed fraction of the baryons but also for the case that the matter fraction is left free .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the statistically preferred value for the abundance of pressureless matter is compatible with the mentioned baryon fraction @xmath1 that follows from the synthesis of light elements .",
    "in addition we discuss here problems of the viscous model to correctly reproduce the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background@xcite and give a brief outlook on a possible solution in the context of causal transport theory.@xcite",
    "the cosmic medium is assumed to be describable by an energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 which splits into a matter part @xmath3 and viscous fluid part @xmath4 , @xmath5 with @xmath6 where the subscript  m \" stands for matter and the subscript  v \" stands for viscous . the total cosmic fluid is characterized by a four velocity @xmath7 while @xmath8 represents the four velocity of the matter part and @xmath9 represents the four velocity of the viscous fluid .",
    "energy - momentum conservation is supposed to hold separately for each of the components , @xmath10 up to first order in the perturbations we have @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in general , the four velocities of the components are different .",

    "this type of unified model differs from unified models in which the total energy density is the sum of a gcg and a baryon component .",
    "only if the baryon component is ignored , both descriptions coincide . consequently , in the homogeneous and isotropic background , a generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath20 can be seen as a unified description of the cosmic medium , consisting of a separately conserved matter component and a bulk viscous fluid with @xmath16 const , where the latter itself represents a unified model of the dark sector .",

    "both of these equations are coupled to each other .",
    "the remarkable point is that these quantities and , consequently , the total energy density perturbation , are independent of the two - component structure of the medium .",

    "to better illustrate the relation between the predictions of the model and the observations , two different normalization wave numbers , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , have been chosen , but our statistical results do not depend on a specific normalization .",
    "( ii ) we leave the matter fraction free , thus admitting that the matter component is not only made up by the baryons .",
    "this is equivalent to allow for a separate dm component in addition to the contribution effectively accounted for by the viscous fluid .",
    "this additional freedom is used to test our unified model of the dark sector itself .",

    "before summarizing our results , two comments are in order here .",
    "the first one concerns a more adequate ,  causal \" description of the viscous fluid , the second one points out the possibility to mimic unified models of the dark sector in terms of kinematic back reactions in an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology .      while the analysis of the matter power spectrum data favors the viscous model , the situation changes if the spectrum of the cmb is considered .",
    "a recent investigation showed , that , at least for the eckart theory applied here , the time dependence of the gravitational potential differs dramatically from the corresponding dependence of the @xmath0cdm model.@xcite this confirms an earlier analysis in ref .   and",
    "severely weakens the status of a viscous dark - sector model .",
    "now , it is well known , that eckart s theory suffers from causality and stability problems .",
    "therefore , one may hope that a more adequate description of the dark sector on the basis of causal thermodynamics can cure this shortcoming .",
    "the essential difference to eckart s theory is , that the algebraic relation @xmath109 which we used in our analysis , is replaced by a differential equation @xmath110 where the relaxation time @xmath111 appears as a new parameter .",
    "this parameter is related to the propagation speed of viscous pulses .",
    "it could be demonstrated , that with a very small value of this dissipative sound speed of the order @xmath112 , this dissipative dark - sector model could indeed produce a gravitational potential similar to that of the @xmath0cdm model.@xcite      there exists a line of research which tries to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe as the consequence of a back reaction of a suitably averaged inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "this approach , which avoids the introduction of dark energy , relies on the fact that the averaged einstein tensor on the left - hand side of the field equations is different from the einstein tensor of an averaged metric .",
    "this difference results in kinematic back - reaction terms , which modify the standard background dynamics.@xcite effective fluid models of this back reaction have been constructed which include the chaplygin gas.@xcite this seems to provide additional motivation for the further investigation of unified dark sector models in a different context .",
    "we have modeled the cosmic substratum at the present time as a mixture of a viscous fluid and baryons . the viscous fluid is assumed to provide a unified description of the cosmological dark sector . in the homogeneous and isotropic background",
    "the two - component system of a bulk viscous fluid and a separately conserved baryon component behaves as a generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "the total energy - density perturbations , however , are intrinsically nonadiabatic and coincide with those of a one - component viscous fluid .",
    "the fluctuations of the baryon component are obtained from a combination of the total energy density perturbations and relative entropy perturbations in the two - component system where the former source the latter .",
    "the observed matter - power spectrum is well reproduced . there do not appear oscillations or instabilities which have plagued adiabatic chaplygin - gas models .",
    "the probability distribution for the deceleration parameter has a maximum at @xmath113 which partially removes the degeneracy of previous studies which , taken at face value , were incompatible with an accelerated expansion and thus in obvious tension with results for the background . with the matter fraction as a free parameter , our analysis also revealed that the matter fraction probability is highest for values smaller than roughly 8% .",
    "this is a result in favor of the unified viscous model .",
    "consequently , as far as the matter power spectrum is concerned , the viscous model remains an option for a unified description of the dark sector . on the other hand ,",
    "the simple viscous model , based on eckart s theory , has problems to account for a gravitational potential that reproduces the cmb power spectrum .",
    "possibly , this problem may be solved with the help of a causal transport theory for the bulk viscous pressure .",
    "support by cnpq and fapes is gratefully acknowledged ."
