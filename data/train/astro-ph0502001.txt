    "multiband photometry including the near infrared ( ir ) band makes it possible to estimate the stellar mass of high redshift galaxies when the observed photometric results are fitted with artificial galaxy spectra generated by a population synthesis model .",
    "working in the near - ir also allows one to construct a mass - selected sample , because near - ir band emission is less affected by dust extinction than at shorter wavelengths and closely traces the total stellar mass . using this technique , a number of recent observational studies have revealed a seemingly new population of very red , massive galaxies at redshift @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we first give a brief review of the results of some of the major surveys that detected such a population of galaxies ( see section  [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "all of these recent observational studies , particularly at @xmath2 , both in the uv and near - ir wavelengths , imply a range of novel tests for the hierarchical structure formation theory .",
    "we now face the important question as to whether this evidence for high - redshift massive galaxy formation is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this question is sometimes called the `` _ massive galaxy problem _ '' .    in more detail , the `` _ massive galaxy problem _ '' that is posed by these observations can be divided into two separate but connected issues : ( 1 ) the `` _ mass - scale problem _ '' , and ( 2 ) the `` _ redness problem _ '' .",
    "the first aspect asks whether the hierarchical cdm model can produce a sufficient number of massive galaxies by @xmath8 .",
    "the second part of the problem , which seems to be more challenging for models , is whether there are enough very red , old , quiet , and massive galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite compared the results of the _ great observatories origins deep survey _ ( goods ) data and the semi - analytic model of @xcite , and concluded that the semi - analytic model shows a deficit of both eros and galaxies with @xmath11 at @xmath12 , and that new or modified physics not yet accounted for in the semi - analytic models is needed to resolved this discrepancy .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable interest whether hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation also suffer from the same problems .    in our first paper of the series @xcite , we argued that , based on two different types of hydrodynamic simulations ( eulerian tvd and sph ) and the theoretical model of @xcite ( hereafter h&s model ) , the predicted cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) density peaks at @xmath13 , with a _ higher _ stellar mass density at @xmath14 than suggested by current observations , in contrast to some claims to the contrary .",
    "this star formation history predicts that 70 ( 50 , 30)% of the total stellar mass at @xmath15 has already been formed by @xmath16 ( 2 , 3 ) .",
    "we also compared our results with those from the updated semi - analytic models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and found that our simulations and the h&s model predicts an earlier peak of the sfr density and a faster build - up of stellar mass density compared to these semi - analytic models .",
    "it is then interesting to examine what our simulations predict for the properties of massive galaxies at @xmath6 . in our second paper @xcite",
    ", we analyzed for this purpose the same set of hydrodynamic simulations , focusing on the uv properties of the most massive galaxies at the relevant epochs . using the latest population synthesis model of @xcite , we computed the spectra of simulated galaxies and performed a spectrophotometric analysis in the @xmath17 filter set .",
    "we found that the simulated galaxies at @xmath18 satisfy the color - selection criteria proposed by @xcite and @xcite when we assume a calzetti extinction with @xmath19 .",
    "the total number density of simulated galaxies brighter than @xmath20 at @xmath18 was about @xmath21 for a uniform extinction of @xmath22 ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] for a discussion of the number density of uv and ir selected galaxies ) .",
    "the most massive galaxies at @xmath18 have stellar masses @xmath23 , and they typically have been continuously forming stars with a rate exceeding @xmath24 over a few gyrs from @xmath25 to @xmath18 , together with a significant number of starbursts reaching @xmath26 , often lasting for a few tens of million years , superposed on the continuous component .",
    "tvd simulations indicated a more sporadic star formation history than the sph simulations .",
    "those galaxies that appear to be red , passive systems at @xmath18 have completed the build - up of their stellar mass by @xmath27 , and have been quiet between @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "we argued that our results imply that hierarchical galaxy formation _ can _ account for the massive galaxies at @xmath28 .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our analysis to the near - ir properties of massive galaxies at @xmath2 , with special focus on colors and stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : observations ] , we give a brief summary of the current observational situation with respect to eros , and in section  [ sec : simulation ] we describe the simulations we use . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we review our method for computing spectra and photometric magnitudes of simulated galaxies .",
    "we present our results for the near - ir properties of galaxies in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "the infrared selection means that the gdds is observing not only star - forming galaxies , as in most high - redshift galaxy surveys , but also quiescent evolved galaxies .",
    "about 25% of their sample shows clear spectral signatures of evolved ( pure old , or old + intermediate - age ) stellar populations , 35% shows features consistent with either a pure intermediate - age or a young + intermediate - age stellar population .",
    "about 29% of the galaxies in the gdds at @xmath33 are young starbursts with strong interstellar lines . using the gdds data",
    ", @xcite estimated the stellar masses , and argued that there are a number of very massive , evolved red ( @xmath34 ) galaxies with stellar masses @xmath35 at @xmath6 , which make a large contribution ( 30% ) to the stellar mass density in the universe . @xcite",
    "estimated the ages of the red galaxies at @xmath36 in the gdds data , and found that they have a median age of @xmath37 gyrs with a history of a strong starburst phase ( @xmath38 ) in the past .",

    "@xcite estimated the stellar mass density from fires data at @xmath68 by combining the estimates of the rest - frame optical luminosity density and the mean cosmic mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the fires group concluded that the red galaxies likely contribute @xmath69 of the stellar mass density in the universe at @xmath70 .",
    "in parallel to the fires , @xcite also discovered 3 objects with @xmath71 at @xmath72 in the hubble deep field south , and that these objects have already assembled @xmath73 by then .",
    "their results suggest that up to 40% of the stellar mass content of bright ( @xmath74 ) local early type galaxies was already in place at @xmath75 .",
    "other works on the global stellar mass density in the universe in the redshift range of @xmath76 include those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "in this section , we describe the two different types of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that we use in this paper .",
    "both approaches include `` standard '' physics such as radiative cooling / heating , star formation , and supernova ( sn ) feedback , although the details of the models and the parameter choices vary considerably .",
    "one set of simulations was performed using an eulerian approach , which employed a particle - mesh method for the gravity and the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) method @xcite for the hydrodynamics , both with a fixed mesh .",
    "the treatment of the radiative cooling and heating is described in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the code is similar to that of @xcite , but it has significantly improved over the years with additional input physics .",

    "the other set of simulations employs the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique .",

    "the code also includes a subresolution multiphase model for the interstellar medium , a phenomenological model for feedback by galactic winds @xcite , and the impact of a uniform ionizing radiation field @xcite .",
    "these simulations have been used previously to study the evolution of the cosmic sfr @xcite , damped lyman-@xmath82 absorbers @xcite , lyman - break galaxies @xcite , disk formation @xcite , emission from the intergalactic medium @xcite , and the detectability of high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted in the simulations are consistent with recent observational determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as summarized in table  [ table : simulation ] , where we list the most important numerical parameters of our primary runs .",
    "while there are many similarities in the physical treatment between the two approaches ( tvd and sph ) , they differ in their relative resolution as a function of density . broadly speaking",
    ", the tvd simulations tend to have better mass resolution in low density regions , while the sph simulations tend to have better spatial resolution in high - density regions . in this sense",
    ", the two approaches can be viewed as complementary , and results found in common can be expected to be robust .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe our spectrophotometric analysis method , which is based on the same techniques for identifying the galaxies in our simulations and computing their spectra as in @xcite .",
    "we use the population synthesis model by @xcite , assuming a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) within a mass range of @xmath90\\,{{\\rm m}_{\\odot}}$ ] , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "spectral properties obtained with this imf are very similar to those obtained using the @xcite imf , but the @xcite imf provides a better fit to counts of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "we use the high resolution version of the spectral library of @xcite which contains 221 spectra describing the spectral evolution of a `` simple stellar population '' from @xmath91 to @xmath92  gyr over 6900 wavelength points in the range of 91  - 160  @xmath10 m . based on the stellar mass , metallicity , and the formation time of each star particle in the simulations ,",
    "we compute the spectrum of each star particle treating it as a simple stellar population .",
    "we then later co - add them to obtain the spectra of simulated galaxies , each typically containing hundreds to thousands of star particles .",
    "once the intrinsic spectrum is computed , we apply the @xcite extinction law with different values of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , in order to investigate the impact of internal extinction within the galaxies .",
    "because the median extinction of the _ k20 _ galaxies is @xmath9 , we take this value as our fiducial value in the following .",
    "note that the analysis presented in @xcite was limited to @xmath98 . using the spectra computed in this manner",
    ", we then derive the rest - frame colors and luminosity functions of the simulated galaxies .    to obtain the spectra in the observed frame",
    ", we redshift the spectra and apply absorption by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "once the redshifted spectra in the observed frame are obtained , we convolve them with different filter functions , including @xmath17 @xcite , standard johnson bands , and sdss bands as well as @xmath99 and @xmath100-bands , and compute the magnitudes in the ab system .",
    "( see @xcite for the details of this procedure . )",

    ".    note that the scatter in the distribution of the simulated galaxies is much smaller compared with the same diagram as a function of @xmath120-band magnitude ( fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",

    "we have used two different types of hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( eulerian tvd and lagrangian sph ) to study the properties of massive galaxies at @xmath2 in a @xmath0cdm universe .",

    "k20 _ , fires , and goods surveys .",
    "our results suggest that hydrodynamic simulations based on the @xmath0cdm model do not exhibit the `` _ mass - scale problem _ '' ; i.e.  there is no obvious difficulty for the simulations to produce a sufficiently large number density of massive galaxies at high redshift , unlike some of the semi - analytic models . in particular , we find that the magnitude limit of @xmath121 ( i.e. , @xmath205 mag ) of the _ k20 _ survey roughly corresponds to the stellar mass @xmath206 at @xmath18 , and the number density above the magnitude limit is @xmath207 at @xmath18 .",
    "the simulated number density above the stellar mass limit of @xmath208 agrees very well with these values .",
    "our simulations can therefore account for the observed number density of massive galaxies found by the _ k20 _ survey .",
    "the mean stellar mass of uv selected galaxies with @xmath144 at @xmath18 by @xcite is @xmath209 , and their space density is @xmath210 @xcite",
    ". therefore the mean stellar mass of the current uv selected sample is smaller by an order of magnitude than the _",
    "k20 _ galaxies , while the number density is higher by an order of magnitude .",
    "roughly @xmath211% of the uv selected sample has @xmath212 , @xmath44 , @xmath213 @xcite , so currently the overlap between the _ k20 _ galaxies and the uv - selected galaxies by @xcite seems to be at most 10% of the uv selected sample at @xmath6 .",
    "of course , the uv selection will miss the reddest galaxies in the _ k20 _ sample .",
    "when the magnitude limit of the @xmath46-band selected sample is brought down to @xmath214 ( i.e. , @xmath215 , as already for the fires data ) , the @xmath46-band selected sample will contain galaxies with @xmath216 at @xmath6 , and the space density of the two samples ( uv selected and @xmath46-band selected ) will be comparable at @xmath210 . at that point , the overlap between the two samples may increase to a fraction higher than 10% . in @xcite , we showed that the total number density of galaxies with @xmath144 in our simulations was about @xmath217 when a uniform extinction of @xmath22 was assumed .",
    "this is twice the value of erb et al.s estimate , therefore we can obtain a consistent picture if the other half of the galaxies have higher extinction values @xmath135 and can only be detected in the @xmath46-band survey .",
    "the answer to the `` _ redness problem _ '' remains somewhat uncertain owing to the unknown dust content of the eros and the number fraction of dusty star - forming galaxies within the observed ero samples .",
    "we have studied the @xmath30 , @xmath142 , and @xmath218 colors of simulated galaxies by applying uniform extinction values to the entire samples . in all cases ,",
    "our simulations suggest that the simulated eros need to have extinction values greater than @xmath9 in order to have colors as red as @xmath84 , @xmath111 , or @xmath112 .",
    "this is consistent with the extinction values estimated for the eros by observational means ( e.g. , cimatti et al .",
    "2002a ; daddi et al .",
    "2004a ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the number density of eros and drgs ( distant red galaxies , see section  [ sec : observations ] ) in our simulations for a uniform extinction of @xmath9 is summarized in table  [ table : ero ] . a robust comparison between theoretical models and observations is currently limited by our poor knowledge of the amount of dust in eros and the number fraction of highly obscured starburst galaxies in the ero samples .",
    "however , the numbers listed in table  [ table : ero ] should serve as a benchmark for more stringent comparisons in the future .",
    "if the median extinction of eros is close to @xmath49 as suggested by @xcite , then the numbers summarized in table  [ table : ero ] may not be so far from the actual values .",
    "this speculation is perhaps not so unreasonable as it may seem , because the recent morphological studies of eros find that the fraction of early and late type is comparable at @xmath219 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", one may plausibly speculate that roughly half of the eros have extinction smaller than @xmath9 , and the other half has @xmath220 .    as we described in section",
    "[ sec : rk ] , our simulations are able to account for the comoving number density of eros of a few @xmath221 at @xmath16 and a few @xmath53 at @xmath18 , provided we assume a uniform extinction of @xmath9 .",
    "these values are comparable to , or even slightly higher than the observational estimates @xcite . taking this result at face value",
    ", our simulations do not appear to exhibit the `` _ redness problem _ '' either .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : bzk ] , if the observed number density of quiescent old eros ( that satisfy the criteria @xmath143 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 ) is really @xmath222 , then the current sph simulations underpredict the space density of such a population at @xmath18 .",
    "the tvd simulation contained one such object , yielding the correct space density , but the statistical uncertainty of this result in a @xmath223 box is , of course , very large .",
    "since the space density of massive eros is fairly low , large simulation boxsizes with @xmath224 are desired for future comparisons with observations .",
    "the controversial question is not just whether the hierarchical models can account for the space density of eros , but it is the number density of _ quiescent , old , passively evolving _ eros .",
    "it appears unlikely that our simulations have a problem in reproducing the space density of star - forming eros .",
    "the @xmath178 diagram proposed by @xcite provides a useful test for this interesting population of old eros which would otherwise be difficult to separate out clearly owing to dust confusion .",
    "indeed , a recent study by @xcite using the hubble ultra deep field data shows that the bulk of objects selected by @xmath143 , @xmath201 , and @xmath225 are old and passive early types at redshifts @xmath226 , with space density of @xmath227 .",
    "the `` redness problem '' is therefore perhaps better described as a `` dead massive ero problem '' .    in this regard",
    "the connection between eros and agns is intriguing . on the observational side",
    ", it is shown by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ that a sizable fraction ( @xmath228% ) of the @xmath229 kev selected sources are associated with eros @xcite .",
    "the majority of the x - ray emitting eros studied so far strongly suggests that the bulk of this population is composed of obscured agns , at least for the brightest x - ray fluxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the theoretical side",
    ", @xcite recently investigated the effect of agn feedback during major mergers of gas - rich spiral galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that mergers with black holes produce ellipticals that redden much faster owing to the suppression of further star formation by a strong outflow generated by the central black hole ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when feedback effects are normalized to reproduce the observed correlation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "therefore , agn feedback may play a critical role in producing red , old , and passively evolving massive eros .",
    "this scenario can be tested with future cosmological simulations which self - consistently include black hole growth and agn feedback processes .",
    "although the different simulation methods analyzed here broadly agree on the properties of high redshift galaxies , there are also interesting systematic differences between them . in general",
    ", the tvd run tends to predict a somewhat higher number density of eros at all redshifts compared with the sph simulations .",
    "this may owe to the fact that the star formation history in the tvd simulation is more sporadic than that of the sph simulations , as we showed in @xcite .",
    "therefore at any given time , the stellar population of the simulated galaxies in the tvd run has more time to become redder between starbursts , without being so frequently affected by the blue light from the most recent star formation .",
    "this difference in the nature of the star formation history probably owes to a combination of differences in the details of the parameterization of the star formation physics , the strength of the feedback effects , the hydrodynamic methods , and the numerical resolution reached in the different simulations .",
    "finally , we comment on the differences between our hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation . as described in section  [ section : intro ] and by @xcite , our simulations have a star formation rate history that peaks at much higher redshift ( @xmath230 ) than that of most published semi - analytic models .",
    "we argue that this is one of the reasons why our hydrodynamic simulations are more successful in reproducing the properties of red massive galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "apparently , the star formation rate at high redshift ( @xmath231 ) is strongly suppressed by supernovae feedback in these semi - analytic models .",
    "while this helps them to match the faint - end of the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath15 , they have problems in explaining eros at high redshift .",
    "however , we note that a more recent revised version of the semi - analytic model by @xcite enhances the burst - mode of star formation and obtains better agreement with the infra - red galaxy number counts and the redshift distribution of submillimeter galaxies at high redshift .",
    "note that both tvd and sph simulations ( see figure  [ f7.eps ] ) automatically includes high amplitude bursts in response to infalling lumps of gas .",
    "another revised semi - analytic model by @xcite incorporates the effects of agn feedback , and now succeeds in producing red massive spheroidal galaxies at early times , also achieving better agreement with the observed infra - red to submillimeter galaxy counts @xcite .",
    "the results on the star formation rate history obtained by these recent semi - analytic models seem to be much closer to our hydrodynamic simulations and show more intense star formation at high redshifts",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether these revised semi - analytic models have the `` _ dead massive ero problem _ '' by examining the @xmath203 diagrams of massive galaxies at @xmath6 .",
