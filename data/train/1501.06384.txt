    "many of the algebraic aspects of rational discrete systems have already been investigated , especially in view of their integrability .",
    "a number of these aspects are extensions to the discrete case of features of continuous systems , but the rationality of the evolution made the algebro - geometric approach inescapable .",
    "it is indeed at the basis of any classification attempt , symmetry or multidimensional consistency analysis , as well as complexity measure via algebraic entropy .",
    "see for example the numerous results exposed in the series of side meetings  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the evolution is also responsible for one recurrent fact : looking at a finite number of steps of the discrete evolution yields informations which are in essence of asymptotic nature , like integrability , hierarchies , or value of the entropy .    motivated by the original works  @xcite and comforted by the more modern approaches  @xcite on continuous systems , the importance of the singularity structure was recognised very early  @xcite .",
    "the use of the apparatus available in two dimensions , and notably the theory of intersection of curves on algebraic surfaces , then lead to powerful theorems , in particular on discrete painlev equations  @xcite and `` qrt '' maps  @xcite .",
    "direct computations of discrete evolutions have also been performed , especially to detect integrability , endeavouring to reduce the size of the calculations .",
    "for instance , looking at the images of a straight line in the space of initial conditions , inspired by the geometrical idea of  @xcite , allows to produce an exact sequence of degrees of the iterates , and in turn to evaluate exactly the algebraic entropy  @xcite . restricting the evolution to integers lightens even more the calculations .",
    "looking then at the growth of their height  @xcite , gives an approximate but efficient way to evaluate the algebraic entropy .",
    "going even further one may perform the calculations on finite fields , analyse various statistical properties  @xcite , and eventually detect integrability .",
    "we take here an opposite attitude , and choose an ingenuous option : we do evaluate exactly the first steps of the evolutions , and analyse their structure , and especially their factorisation properties .",
    "the main outcome is that the form of the iterates , shaped by the singularities , suggests changes of description which automatically provide :    * exact calculations of the algebraic entropy , and proofs of its algebraicity ( see  @xcite for a general point of view on this question ) * generalisations of the discrete hirota - sato form and @xmath0 functions  @xcite , reducing to the standard quadratic form in specific integrable cases * various polynomial and integer factorisation properties similar the laurent property  @xcite    the plan of the paper is the following :    in section [ basics ] we briefly recall basic algebro - geometric notions which will be at the core of the phenomenon we exhibit .    in section [ models ]",
    "we describe explicitly a number of models in various dimensions :    * an algebraically integrable two dimensional map in the qrt family : mcmillan * a discrete painlev equation @xmath1 , i.e. a non autonomous extension of the previous * another discrete painlev equation : @xmath2 * a non integrable non confining map in two dimensions : jaeger * a confining non integrable map in two dimensions : jnh - cmv * another confining non integrable map in two dimensions * a three dimensional algebraically integrable map : n=3 periodic volterra * a linearisable map * an unruly model in three dimensions * a recurrence of order 2 on functional space , delay differential equation * an integrable lattice map : @xmath3    we conclude with suggestions for further explorations .",

    "@xmath8 ) are the ones for which @xmath15 , ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) . we know that the sets of singular points are algebraic varieties of dimension @xmath17 .",

    "each factor @xmath24 defines an algebraic variety of codimension @xmath25 playing an important rle in the sequel .",
    "there is a simple relation between the varieties @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the singular locus of @xmath7 and @xmath8 : the varieties of equation @xmath26 are blown down by @xmath7 and their images are entirely made of singular points of @xmath8 .",
    "this reflects the fact that one can not take one step forward and then a step backward when starting from a point on @xmath27 .",
    "the same applies to @xmath8 mutatis mutandis .",
    "suppose @xmath28 is an indecomposable variety of codimension @xmath25 of equation @xmath29 .",
    "the pullback by @xmath7 of the equation of @xmath28 gives the equation @xmath30 of the image @xmath31 of @xmath28 by @xmath8 .",
    "the important point is that this pullback may contain additional factors .",
    "@xmath32 such factors are necessarily built from components of @xmath20 .",
    "their presence reflects the difference between total and proper transform : the non - singular points of @xmath28 go into the proper transform .",
    "the singular subvarieties contained in @xmath28 are blown up to the other components . in a way the proper transform",
    "is the true image , disregarding the singularities .",
    "singularity confinement  @xcite in this context is just that some iterate of @xmath7 sends components of @xmath20 into components of @xmath21 .",
    "the regularisation comes , when described with homogeneous coordinates , from the removal of factor common to all coordinates .",
    "this is also the origin of the possible drop of degree of the iterates of @xmath7 .",
    "remark 1 : a consequence of the existence of the variety @xmath27 is that the image by @xmath7 of a generic line always hits some singular point of @xmath8 .",
    "the reason is that any generic line crosses @xmath20 , since we are working with complex projective space . in other words , while the image of a generic point is always a generic point , the image of a generic line is never a generic line .",
    "remark 2 : a variety could be its own transform .",
    "it is then covariant by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "covariant objects play a fundamental rle in the description of the algebraic invariants  @xcite .    by abuse of language",
    "we will say that @xmath33 is the proper transform of @xmath34 , if @xmath34 and @xmath33 are the equations of varieties which are the proper transforms of each other by @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "given an evolution map @xmath7 , denote by @xmath35 the successive images can be obtained from @xmath35 either by the action of @xmath7 on @xmath35 , either by pulling back the coordinates of @xmath35 . the homogeneous coordinates obtained in these two ways may differ , but they represent the same point projectively .",

    "they however will not spoil the general features of the recurrences between blocks .",
    "the simplest possible type of discrete systems is given by recurrences of finite order .",
    "a recurrence of order @xmath38 may be looked at as a map in its @xmath38 dimensional space of initial data .",
    "there are two natural generalisations , leading to infinite dimensional space of initial conditions : recurrences defined over functional space , and recurrences with multi - indices ( lattice maps ) .",

    "we moreover know that the pullback of any @xmath165 by @xmath7 is of the form @xmath171 , it is easy to show the validity of ( [ hirodelay ] ) for @xmath172 . in particular , one finds that @xmath173 is the proper transform of @xmath174 and moreover @xmath175    so that the pullback of the derivative term appearing in ( [ hirodelay ] ) does not contain factors @xmath176 .",
    "we also get relations on the various degrees @xmath177 : @xmath178 one then easily proves the result on the sequence of degrees of @xmath82 given in  @xcite @xmath179 ensuring the vanishing of the entropy .    one could always question the notion of integrability for differential - difference equations , and even more for delay - difference equations , but the vanishing of the algebraic entropy is a very strong structural constraint on the equation .      the model , introduced in  @xcite is defined on a plane square lattice , by a multilinear relations between the values of an unknown function @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "it interpolates between the various models of the adler - bobenko - suris list  @xcite , and has seven free parameters .",

    "we choose to give initial conditions on two adjacent diagonals , labelled @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and use the local condition to fill the entire lattice .",
    "points on the diagonal @xmath38 have coordinates @xmath188 with @xmath189 .",
    "we may then define a map @xmath7 from diagonal @xmath38 to @xmath190 , and @xmath8 from diagonal @xmath190 to @xmath38 ( straight arrows in figure  1 ) , for which the values on diagonal @xmath172 enter as parameters . although the space of initial conditions is infinite , a point @xmath191 , sees only a finite number of initial points on the diagonals @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "we projectivise the system by turning the space of values at each point in to a projective line @xmath192 , with homogeneous coordinates @xmath193 $ ] so that @xmath194 , and writing only polynomial expressions , keeping in mind that any common factor to @xmath195 and @xmath196 ought to be removed .",
    "figure 1 : initial conditions and ( north - east ) evolution    we know from  @xcite that the drop of the degrees of the successive iterates is intimately related to one of the biquadratics given in  @xcite .",
    "this biquadratic is nothing but the multiplier @xmath197 calculated on one cell : to any pair of adjacent points @xmath198 , @xmath199 on a diagonal we associate the polynomial @xmath200 the key fact is that these polynomials split into two factors as soon as @xmath201 .",
    "one of these two factors is common to @xmath202 and @xmath203 the second one is common to @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the evolution equations may be rewritten as the recurrence @xmath206 with the added initial condition that @xmath207 for @xmath208 .",
    "the various points entering the defining relation of the @xmath209 s are pictured in figure 1 with the curved arrows .",
    "the @xmath209 s and the @xmath210 s given by ( [ hiroqv ] ) are _ polynomials in the initial conditions , and there is no additional common factor to @xmath202 and @xmath203 for generic values of the parameters @xmath109_. relations ( [ hiroqv ] ) yield the sequence of degrees of the iterates found in  @xcite , quadratic growth and vanishing entropy .",
    "more details will be given elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that , for systems undergoing a rational discrete evolution , a self - organisation takes place after a finite number of steps : the structure of the iterates stabilises - this is to be compared with the results of  @xcite - and the @xmath0 functions pop out spontaneously as pieces of the components of the iterates , providing a new set of variables to describe the evolution .",
    "this change of description of the models is not to be confused with a usual ( birational ) change of coordinates : we barter the original coordinates for pieces of the components of strings of successive iterates and transforms of the factors of the multipliers @xmath20 .",
    "the recurrence relations obeyed by the new variables provide us with an exact evaluation of the algebraic entropy and of its avatars obtained by reductions to integers and finite fields , without restriction to integrability .",
    "they support , by the form they take , the fundamental conjecture presented in  @xcite that the entropy is always the logarithm of an algebraic integer .",
