    "quantum state manipulation has become a fascinating perspective of modern physics . with concepts developed in atomic and molecular physics",
    "the field has been further stimulated by the possibility of quantum computation .",
    "for this purpose a number of individual two - state quantum systems ( qubits ) should be manipulated in a controlled way .",
    "several physical realizations of qubits have been considered in recent years , but nano - electronic devices appear particularly promising because they can be embedded in circuit and scaled up to large number of qubits .",
    "in addition to manipulation , single qubit measurement is an important and delicate question .",
    "for instance , a force resolution of attonewtons is required to detect qubits represented by single spins @xcite .",
    "nowadays , magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) is striving for this ultimate goal @xcite .",
    "the use of cantilevers to detect small forces is at the heart of force microscopy in all its various forms @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is one of the most promising techniques to also achieve single spin detection .    usually , small magnetic samples of unpaired electron spins are detected using a mrfm technique based on cyclic adiabatic inversion ( cai ) @xcite , and the quantum dynamics of measurement for this method has been recently discussed in @xcite . however , a new technique called `` oscillating - cantilever - driven adiabatic reversals '' ( oscar ) has been proposed and implemented in @xcite , where a sensitivity of about one hundred spins has been demonstrated . very recently , this detection protocol has been improved and a sensitivity equivalent to a single electron spin has been finally achieved @xcite . in the oscar protocol , the driven cantilever causes the adiabatic inversion of the paramagnetic moment of the sample .",
    "the backaction of this moment causes a frequency shift of the cantilever , which is then detected by a fiber - optic interferometer .",
    "a classical description of the spin - cantilever dynamics in the oscar technique has been given in ref .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the spin - cantilever system has been instead studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the master equation including the decohering effect of a high - temperature environment has been solved numerically .",
    "the present paper investigates the quantum dynamics of the whole system including not only the spin and the cantilever , but also the effective measurement device , i.e. , the fiber - optic interferometer , which is here represented by a quantized radiation mode .",
    "the spin state manifests itself in the probability distribution of the phase of the field and our treatment allows us to take into account also the backaction of the measurement meter ( the field mode ) on the spin - cantilever system .",
    "differently from @xcite , our approach is based on the exact analytical solution of the quantum dynamics which is valid in the adiabatic limit and for not too large spin - cantilever coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mod ]",
    "we introduce the model , then in section [ dyn ] we solve the quantum dynamics . in section",
    "[ qm ] we present the main results .",
    "section iv is for concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a model where a ferromagnetic particle is mounted on the cantilever tip . a permanent magnetic field @xmath0 points in the @xmath1 direction , while a rf field of magnitude @xmath2 rotates in the @xmath3 plane in resonance with the spin precession around @xmath1 axis at frequency @xmath4 . a radiation field",
    "is then used to monitor the cantilever s position .",
    "we describe the cantilever interacting with a single electron spin-@xmath5 as a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath6 , and the radiation field as a single electromagnetic mode of frequency @xmath7 .",
    "then , the dimensionless hamiltonian for such a system ( scaled by the factor @xmath8 ) can be written as @xmath9     \\nonumber\\\\     & - & \\sqrt{2}\\eta ( a+a^{\\dag } ) s_z - \\kappa b^{\\dag}b(a+a^{\\dag})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the ladder operator of the cantilever @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the momentum and @xmath1-coordinate operators of the cantilever , and @xmath14 is the cantilever spring constant .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the ladder operators of the radiation mode with @xmath17=1 $ ] , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are the usual spin operators obeying the commutation rule @xmath22=2is_z$ ] and its cyclic permutations .",
    "the first row of eq .  ( [ h0 ] ) is the free hamiltonian of the system , the second row is the driving term of amplitude @xmath23 given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "finally , the third row contains the spin - cantilever interaction ( due to the spatially varying magnetic field @xmath0 ) with coupling constant @xcite @xmath26 and the optomechanical interaction ( due to the radiation pressure force ) with coupling constant @xmath27 , which , for a cavity interferometer with length @xmath28 is given by @xcite @xmath29    the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) in interaction picture with respect to @xmath30 reads @xmath31 which is the same model hamiltonian considered in @xcite , supplemented with the optomechanical interaction with the readout radiation mode @xmath15 .",
    "it is then convenient to apply the @xmath32 rotation around the @xmath33 axis in the spin space @xmath34 $ ] exchanging @xmath35 and @xmath36 , to obtain the transformed hamiltonian @xmath37 apart from the additional optomechanical interaction term , eq .  ( [ hrot ] ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a two - level atom with energy separation @xmath38 interacting with a quantized radiation mode with unit oscillation frequency , represented by the cantilever @xmath1-motion @xcite . the equivalent dipole - interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ hrot ] ) contains also counter - rotating terms , which are usually neglected in quantum optical situations ( rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ) @xcite .",
    "this approximation is however not justified in the present case .",
    "in fact , in typical mrfm situations , the spin is much faster than the cantilever and adiabatically follows the cantilever motion , i.e. , @xmath39 . to be more precise , the oscar technique is usually operated under the adiabatic condition @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the mean amplitude of the cantilever oscillations , and under the full reversal condition @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the best signal sensitivity is achieved for partial adiabatic reversals , i.e. @xmath43 . along this line",
    ", we consider the limit @xmath44 together with @xmath45 , which allow us to treat the interaction part of eq .",
    "( [ hrot ] ) as a small perturbation with respect to the free hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "thus , keeping the lowest nonzero order terms ( first order in @xmath27 and second order in @xmath47 ) , we end up with the effective hamiltonian @xmath48 where the effective spin ",
    "cantilever interaction @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the third term of eq.([heff ] ) , describes a dispersive interaction in which the spin and the cantilever energies are independently conserved and one induces a state  dependent phase shift on the other . in particular , the cantilever undergoes a frequency shift @xmath51 depending upon the value of @xmath36 , which is just the frequency shift which is detected in the oscar technique by means of a phase sensitive measurement of the radiation mode . therefore we expect that by measuring the probability distribution of the field phase one effectively measures the spin component @xmath36 , which corresponds to @xmath35 in the initial , non - rotated frame .",
    "this is consistent with the classical description of mrfm @xcite , in which the cantilever always measures the spin component along the effective magnetic field which , in the strong adiabatic limit of very large @xmath23 considered here , is essentially aligned along the @xmath52 direction .",
    "to describe a realistic situation we consider the cantilever plunged in a thermal bath at equilibrium temperature @xmath53 and subject to a viscous force with damping rate @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 ) .",
    "this situation corresponds to an ohmic environment @xcite , and since for typical mrfm cantilevers @xmath56 is of order of some khz , it is @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the boltzmann s constant ) even at cryogenic temperatures , so that environmental effects are satisfactorily described in terms of the caldeira - leggett master equation @xcite , which is valid in the high temperature limit and is described by the superoperator @xcite @xmath59    \\nonumber\\\\    & & -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\frac{k_{b}t}{\\hbar\\omega_{c } }    \\left[a+a^{\\dag},\\left[a+a^{\\dag},{\\widetilde\\rho}\\right]\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the density matrix of the rotated system .",
    "therefore , the complete system dynamics will be governed by the following master equation @xmath61 +     { \\cal{l } } { \\widetilde\\rho},\\ ] ] where , due to the adoption of the dimensionless hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) , time @xmath62 is also dimensionless , i.e. , scaled by @xmath6 .    in order to solve the master equation ( [ mas ] )",
    "we introduce the eigenstates @xmath63 , @xmath64 of @xmath65 with eigenvalues @xmath66 ,  @xmath67 respectively , and we split the total density operator as @xmath68 with @xmath69^{\\dag}$ ] .",

    "[ split ] ) can be expanded on the set of fock states external product operators @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) for the radiation mode and on the continuous set of displacement operators @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) for the cantilever mode , as follow @xcite @xmath76 ) .    from eq .",

    "as discussed above , the cantilever s position carries information about the spin state and , in turn , it is read by the radiation field . due to the optomechanical coupling",
    ", the cantilever affects the phase of the field and we have therefore to look at the probability distribution of the latter . the canonical probability operator measure ( pom ) for phase measurement is @xcite @xmath82 where we have introduced the new time @xmath83 which , due to the scaling chosen above , is a dimensionless time now scaled by the cantilever damping rate @xmath54 , and @xmath84 with @xmath85 . from eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) we get @xmath86    let us now determine the conditions under which the apparatus performs reliable measurements of the spin . as discussed above , the apparatus is expected to measure @xmath35 ( in the original non - rotated frame ) and therefore the easiest case is when the initial state of the spin is an eigenstate of @xmath35 ( in the non - rotated frame ) .",
    "we consider , for example , the eigenstate with @xmath87 , which correspond to state @xmath88 in the rotated frame and therefore implying @xmath89 ( in the rotated frame ) is a constant of motion and one has a cantilever frequency shift @xmath49 ( see eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) ) which manifests itself as a shift of the phase distribution ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the phase probability distribution is initially peaked around @xmath90 , due to the real amplitude ( @xmath91 ) of the initial coherent state of the radiation mode .",
    "then the peak moves , toward larger values of @xmath92 , and faster than that with @xmath93 .",
    "if we had started from state @xmath94 ( @xmath95 in the rotated frame ) , one would have a smaller phase shift of the peak .",
    "this could be surprising as one would expect a greater phase shift for frequency @xmath96 and a smaller one for @xmath97 .",
    "however , if one just considers the unitary evolution arising from eq.([heff ] ) , one reduces to the model studied in refs.@xcite , where it is possible to argue that the induced phase shift is inversely proportional to the cantilever s frequency .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have considered two different values of temperature , @xmath98 ( a ) and @xmath99 ( b ) , which for typical cantilever frequencies @xmath100 , correspond to @xmath101 @xmath102k and @xmath103 mk respectively .",

    "[ fig2 ] refers to the initial condition @xmath95 in the initial frame , corresponding to the state @xmath114 in the rotated frame .",
    "this implies @xmath115 due to the superposition , the measurement performed by the mrfm is reliable when we have the simultaneous presence of two distinct peaks in the phase distribution , associated with the two different phase shifts induced by the two spin components .",
    "this means that the measurement time has not to be too small , in order to allow the two peaks to become distinguishable .",

    "unfortunately , for such a small value of @xmath49 , the radiation field phase shift due to a single spin is too small to be detected and therefore larger values of @xmath49 , which means larger values of the coupling constant @xmath47 , are needed to allow a reliable detection of the spin state within a reasonable detection time .",
    "also a larger number of photons in the radiation mode would improve the resolution because in such a case the peaks in phase distributions would be narrower .",
    "finally , another important parameter is the optomechanical coupling @xmath27 between cantilever and the radiation readout mode . similarly to @xmath49 , this parameter has to be sufficiently large , because otherwise the phase measurement has not enough sensitivity ( see the dotted line in fig .",
