    "any field - theoretical hamiltonian does not conserve the number of particles .",
    "therefore , in the basis , corresponding to fixed number of particles , it is a non - diagonal matrix .",
    "its eigenvector  the state vector of a physical system  is an infinite superposition ( fock decomposition ) of the states with different numbers of particles : @xmath0 @xmath1 is the @xmath2-body wave function ( fock component ) and @xmath3 is an integration measure .    in many cases ,",
    "though not always , we can expect that a finite number of degrees of freedom dominates , that is , the decomposition ( [ eq1 ] ) converges enough quickly . in some examples",
    "the convergence is even better than one can expect naively . in these cases",
    "we can make truncation , that is replace the infinite sum in ( [ eq1 ] ) by the finite one .",
    "then , substituting truncated state vector in the eigenvector equation @xmath4 we obtain a finite system of integral equations for the fock components @xmath1 which can be solved numerically .",
    "we do not require the smallness of the coupling constant .",
    "the approximate ( truncated ) solution is non - perturbative .",
    "this is the basis of non - perturbative approach which we developed , together with j .- f .",
    "mathiot and a.v .",
    "smirnov , in a series of our papers @xcite ( see for review @xcite ) .    the main difficulty in this way is to ensure cancellation of infinities after renormalization . in perturbative approach , for a renormalizable field theory , in any fixed order of coupling constant , this cancellation , after renormalization ,",
    "is obtained as a by - product .",
    "however , it is important to take into account full set of graphs in a given order .",
    "omitting some of these graphs destroys the cancellation and the infinities survive after renormalization . namely that happens after truncation : though the truncated solution can be decomposed in infinite series in terms of the coupling constant , in any given order it does not contain full set of perturbative graphs . therefore the standard renormalization scheme does not eliminate infinities . to restore cancellation of infinities , there was proposed @xcite the sector - dependent scheme .",
    "this scheme , in which the values of the counter terms are precised from sector to sector according to unambiguously formulated rules , was developed in detail in @xcite .",
    "following these rules , the problem , at first , should be solved and the counter terms are found in the two - body truncation . in the highest ( two - body )",
    "sector the counter terms do not appear .",
    "their presence would mean implicit incorporation of extra intermediate states .",
    "the counter terms correspond to sum of the graphs containing the intermediate particles ( loop graphs , for example ) .",
    "these states , together with the two - body ones , constitute the three - body sector and therefore they exceed the two - body truncation .",
    "the one - body sector contains the two - body counter terms .",
    "they are found from the renormalization conditions imposed on the two - body solution .",
    "then the problem is solved again , in the three - body truncation , which retains now the sum of one- , two- and three - body sectors . in the highest ( three - body )",
    "sector the counter terms do not appear .",
    "the two - body sector contains already known counter terms found previously in the two - body truncation .",
    "the one - body sector contains the three - body counter terms which appear there for the first time .",
    "they are found from the renormalization conditions imposed on the three - body solution .",
    "then this procedure is repeated for the next truncation .",
    "we repeat it for clarity for the four - body truncation .",
    "namely , the four - body truncation retains the sum of one- , two- , three- and four - body sectors . in the four - body sector",
    "the counter terms do not appear ( to avoid the exceed up to the five - body sector ) .",
    "the three - body sector contains the counter terms found previously in the two - body truncation .",
    "the two - body sector contains the counter terms found previously in the three - body truncation .",
    "the one - body sector contains the four - body counter terms which appear there for the first time .",
    "they are found from the renormalization conditions imposed on the four - body solution .",
    "when the number @xmath5 of incorporated fock sectors increases , it is naturally expected that the solutions , found in this way ,  the state vector and the counter terms ,  converge to a limiting exact values . however ,",
    "this has never been checked .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "( _ i _ ) it is not easy to solve the equations for the fock components for enough large @xmath5 . for the present , it was solved for @xmath6 .",
    "( _ ii _ ) there is no any field - theoretical model in which the exact state vector and the counter terms are known .",
    "therefore one can not compare a truncated solution with the exact one .",
    "we will give here a simple - minded example of the solvable `` 0-dimentional '' field theory in which ( _ i _ ) the equations for the fock components for enough large @xmath5 can be solved numerically ; ( _ ii _ ) the comparison of truncated solution with the exact one can be done . our aim is two - fold .",
    "( _ i _ ) to demonstrate in a simple example the sector dependent renormalization procedure .",
    "( _ ii _ ) to check the convergence of the truncated solutions for increasing @xmath5 to the exact solution .",
    "+     system of equations in the two - body truncation , relating one- and two - body components , is graphically shown in fig .",
    "@xmath7 are the vertex functions related to the wave functions @xmath8 as @xmath9 deriving these equations , we first suppose that the bare mass @xmath10 ( internal particle ) and the external mass @xmath11 are not equal to each other .",
    "then we impose on the mass counter term @xmath12 the renormalization condition due to which @xmath13 . the first term in the r.h .- side of the equation shown in the first line of fig . [ fig1 ] , contains the one - body propagator corresponding to the line connecting @xmath14 and the vertex @xmath15 . the same propagator is also put in correspondence to the line connecting @xmath14 and @xmath16 in r.h .- side of the equation shown in the second line of fig .",
    "it just reads @xmath17 and it is absorbed into @xmath14 , giving @xmath18 . whereas l.h .- side of this equation does not contain propagator . in terms of @xmath18",
    "it obtains the form @xmath19 and disappears when we take @xmath20 keeping @xmath18 finite .",
    "therefore the system of equations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] reads : @xmath21    in the second term in r.h .- side of the first equation we replaced the integral term @xmath22 corresponding to the loop by the product @xmath23 .",
    "we will make similar replacements also in the equations for higher truncations .",
    "this is the reason why we call this toy model the `` zero - dimensional '' model .",
    "also , for simplicity of notations , for @xmath24 , we identify here and below @xmath25 with @xmath1 .    for clarity of construction , we keep in r.h .- side of the second equation in ( [ eq1a ] ) the term @xmath26 which should be found from the previous one - body truncation .",
    "however , the one - body truncation is trivial  it does not contain interaction .",
    "the latter changes the number of particles and therefore relates the one - body and two - body sectors .",
    "therefore @xmath27 and in the sector - dependent renormalization scheme this term does not contribute .",
    "that s why it is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the realistic case , the goal of the sector - dependent scheme is elimination of infinities , in spite of truncation .",
    "however , the infinities are absent in the 0d model .",
    "we develop this ( non - divergent ) toy model in order to illustrate , in a simple example , the sector dependent renormalization procedure ( even without eliminating infinities ) .",
    "we will also check , when the truncation @xmath5 increases , whether the solution found in this scheme tends at all to the exact solution , and if it tends to it  how quickly .",
    "exact solution is the solution of the original field - theoretical equations in which the counter terms , in contrast to the sector dependent scheme , are the same in any sector and the dimension of the matrix acting on the ( infinite ) fock column is infinite . to find the solution for infinite matrix , we still start with a finite matrix of the dimension @xmath28 , keeping the counter terms as they are ( i.e. the same in all the sectors ) and then take the limit @xmath29 .",
    "we start with the case @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding system of equations is obtained from ( [ eq1a ] ) by setting @xmath31 . in the matrix form",
    "it reads : @xmath32    in the case @xmath33 the system of equations ( [ eq1a ] ) is generalized as : @xmath34    the generalization of this system of equations to the case of matrix of arbitrary dimension has the form : @xmath35 and interaction @xmath36 should satisfy two following properties : ( _ i _ ) it connects only the neighbor components : 1-body @xmath37 2-body , 2-body @xmath37 3-body , etc . , like in the case of the interaction @xmath38 or the yukawa model @xmath39 ; ( _ ii _ ) it becomes weaker for higher components ( since creation of large number of particles requires more energy ) .",
    "the latter property should be also automatically provided by a field - theoretical hamiltonian ; in the toy model we mimic it by constructing @xmath36 which decreases when @xmath40 increase .",
    "the interaction @xmath36 , satisfying these properties , can be chosen , for example , as : @xmath41    we will find at first the exact solution .",
    "we take strong coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) ( the @xmath30 case ) obtains the form : @xmath43 solving the quadratic equation @xmath44 relative to @xmath12 , we find two solutions : @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    in the case",
    "@xmath33 , solving corresponding cubic equation @xmath44 with @xmath11 defined in ( [ eq1b ] ) ( or , equivalently , in ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ vij1 ] ) ) , we find three solutions : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we will consider the first ( negative ) solution as the physical one .",
    "increasing @xmath5 up to @xmath50 ( and solving numerically the equations for @xmath12 up to the 10th degree ) , we find the values of @xmath12 shown in the table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the digits which remain stable when @xmath5 increases are underlined .",
    "for example , the underlined digits in @xmath51 for @xmath33 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) are reproduced in the value @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the underlined digits in @xmath12 for @xmath54 ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) are reproduced for @xmath56 .",
    "the convergence of the @xmath12 value when @xmath5 increases is very fast .",
    "for @xmath57 we get 14 digits which are reproduced in the next truncation @xmath50 .",
    "the solution with the precision 10 digits ( for @xmath58 ) or 14 digits ( for @xmath57 ) we call the `` exact '' solution . strictly speaking ,",
    "it is not exact , but the precision in 10 - 14 digits is quite enough .

    "the first three components dominate : they give @xmath73 of full normalization .",
    "this justifies the truncation .",
    "now let us use the sector - dependent scheme .",
    "this means that in the system of equations ( [ eq1a ] ) we put @xmath27 and find @xmath15 . instead of ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "we get : @xmath74 solving equation @xmath44 ( which is now linear relative to @xmath75 ) we find @xmath76 , in comparison to the @xmath30 value @xmath77 from the table [ tab1 ] .    in the case",
    "@xmath33 the system of equations ( [ eq1b ] ) is replaced by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the mass counter term for the @xmath33 sector to be found .",
    "the matrix equation obtains now the form : @xmath82 from the linear equation @xmath44 we find @xmath83 , in comparison to the @xmath33 value @xmath84 from the table [ tab1 ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) one can already guess that , in general , in the sector - dependent scheme the matrix @xmath11 in ( [ eq3 ] ) is replaced by the following @xmath28 matrix : @xmath85 with @xmath86 found successively from sector to sector ( and @xmath27 ) .    solving the equation @xmath44 ( which is still linear relative to @xmath87 ) with the values @xmath27 , and @xmath88 found previously , we find successive sector - dependent values of @xmath89 shown in the table [ tab4 ] .",
    "like in the table [ tab1 ] , the digits which remain stable when @xmath5 increases are underlined .",
    "the 4th iteration @xmath90 gives the precision @xmath91 .",
    "the 8th iteration @xmath92 gives the precision of the order of @xmath93 .",

    "namely @xmath104 the convergence is super fast . in the sector",
    "dependent scheme the value @xmath58 provides @xmath87 , coinciding with the exact one , with the stability in 40 digits .",
    "this simple example illustrates the iterative procedure which is used in the sector - dependent renormalization scheme .",
    "it shows that the mass counter @xmath87 , found by this procedure from a linear equation , converges , when @xmath5 increases , rather quickly to the `` exact '' value calculated without any sector - dependent scheme .    in this toy model ,",
    "the renormalization of the coupling constant is absent . in the realistic case",
    ", it appears .",
    "in addition , another counter term @xmath105 appears @xcite , which eliminates , on the mass shell , in the @xmath106-matrix , representing the two - body vertex in the spinor basis , the non - diagonal ( light - front orientation dependent ) elements .",
    "after that this vertex can be identified with the coupling constant .",
    "however , the sector dependent renormalization procedure remains the same : instead of one counter term @xmath87 , we should find now from the renormalization conditions , for given @xmath5 , the three ones : still @xmath87 , the bare coupling constant @xmath107 ( i.e. , express it in terms of the physical one @xmath108 ) and also @xmath109",
    ". then we use these three values in calculations in the next @xmath110 sector .",
    "as mentioned , the sector dependent renormalization procedure is aimed to cancellation of infinities , for any given truncation @xmath5 .",
    "this example does not show this property , since the infinities are absent at all .",
    "similar calculation in yukawa model , containing divergences and renormalization of mass and the coupling constant , was carried out in @xcite in the @xmath33 truncation for three values of the physical coupling constant , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the pauli - villars ( pv ) regularization with one pv fermion and one pv boson was used .",
