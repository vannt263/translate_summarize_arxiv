    "the hysteresis loops of the pe evolve toward smaller loops , but for , the hysteresis loops disappear after and the magnetization from both branches reaches a stable value within the pe region .",
    "since for the magnetization from both branches reaches about the same value after , a stable value of the magnetization of ceru@xmath0 at each field can be determined by averaging the last of magnetization data @xmath33 at .",
    "[ fig : eqpes ] depicts the experimentally determined stable state of the magnetization of ceru@xmath0 ( @xmath50 ) within the pe .",

    "after the pe is destroyed at , the magnetization becomes reversible and follows approximately the linear interpolation between the beginning and the end of the initial hysteresis loop of the pe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dstroype ] ) .",
    "previous measurements  @xcite of the flux flow resistance @xmath51 in the mixed state of ceru@xmath0 showed field hysteresis at the lower onset of the pe region : for @xmath52 , near the onset of the pe the resistance is higher in the ascending field branch than in the descending - field branch .",
    "the flux motion is inhibited more in the descending - field branch near the lower onset of the pe .",
    "this behavior is equivalent to the observed mismatch @xmath26 in the @xmath17 data for ( fig .",
    "[ fig : peloops ] ) , except at the same temperature it is more pronounced in resistivity data than the magnetization data .",
    "@xcite this hysteresis at the lower onset of the pe was also observed in several superconducting materials , such as 2h - nbse@xmath0 ,  @xcite ca@xmath5rh@xmath53sn@xmath10 ,  @xcite and nb .",
    "@xcite also shown by the relaxation data of the magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rlx4p2k ] ) , the flow of the fll in this portion of the pe changes very quickly from the behavior of a softer fll ( i.e. , larger pinning ) in the beginning to more coherent motion of a stiff fll ( i.e. , reduction of pinning ) . thus , this hysteresis seems strongly connected to the metastable disordered phase generated by edge contamination observed in 2h - nbse@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it is believed that bulk pinning is greatly reduced in more 2-dimensional compound 2h - nbse@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , the similarity of behavior of the fluxoids in the pe region of the cubic ceru@xmath0 compound to that of nbse@xmath0 indicates that the underlying pinning mechanism may be independent of crystal dimensionality .    as observed from the relaxation data , the fll in the disordered state for and @xmath42",
    "has not yet reached a thermal equilibrium state since its effective pinning force is still decreasing towards zero .",
    "as , vortex lines can reach an equilibrium state by fast relaxation that is possibly due to thermal fluctuations or to the shaking effect  @xcitecaused by the scanning movement of the sample from one pick up coil to the other in squid magnetometer .",
    "the stable - state magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eqpes ] ) we determined from magnetic relaxation in the pe of ceru@xmath0 is reminiscent of a phase transition , especially compared with the magnetization data taken in the same sample after its pe is suppressed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dstroype ] ) .",
    "recently , two experiments were reported in which the stable - state magnetization of ceru@xmath0 in the pe region was determined by cycling the magnetic field with a small amplitude at in ceru@xmath0 s pe .",

    "@xcite has a step shape .",
    "although these experimental results do not agree with one another , in both cases this stable state was considered to result from an occurrence of a first order phase transition .    if the stable - state magnetization at and is assumed to be related to the first order melting of the fll , then the jump in magnetization expected for such a vortex melting transition can be estimated from the clausius - claperon relation , @xmath54 .",

    "this estimate of @xmath60 is much smaller than what we observed from at and at ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eqpes ] ) . whether the stable - state magnetization is associated with a first order melting in the the pe region but is obscured by the disordered phase appearing near the sample surface , the magnetization data alone are not sufficient for resolving this issue .",
    "thus , whether the fll undergoes a first - order or continuous phase transition in the pe region or simply just a crossover of the dynamical behavior is not yet clear .",
    "how ceru@xmath0 s pe can be suppressed by rapid thermal cycling of the temperature between 10 k and is still a mystery .",
    "previous low temperature x - ray diffraction studies show the laves phase compounds laru@xmath0  @xcite and ( la@xmath61,ce@xmath62)ru@xmath0  @xcite with @xmath63 undergo a cubic - tetragonal structural transition at .",
    "we suspected a small part of the ceru@xmath0 sample might also undergo a similar structural phase transition at some temperature between 10 k and 300 k. small regions of transformed structure within the sample could provide pinning centers .",
    "if the sample temperature was changed rapidly , the high temperature laves phase crystal structure of ceru@xmath0 might be quenched to low temperature and reduce the pe .",
    "however , the previous x - ray studies did not provide any evidence of such a structural phase transformation in ceru@xmath0  @xcite . after suppressing the pe",

    "in summary , we have performed magnetic relaxation measurements between and in the pe region of ceru@xmath0 . for , due to stronger pinning , the fll relaxes at a much slower rate and does not reach a stable state within the duration of the measurement ( ) .",

    "@xcite we also found that the pe of ceru@xmath0 can be removed by rapid thermal cycling of the sample between room temperature and several times , and the reversible magnetization follows a linear interpolation across the pe region . compared with the reversible magnetization of ceru@xmath0 without the pe ,",
