    "the distinctive optical spectra of carbon giants have led to their use as probes of the galactic halo , especially since their bright magnitudes enable radial velocities to be obtained at very large distances ( aaronson 1983 ) .",
    "for the first three quarters of the last century , giants were the only luminosity class of carbon stars known . with the discovery of g77 - 61 ( dahn et al .",
    "1977 ) at a mere 58 pc and therefore relatively low luminosity , a category of dwarf carbon ( dc ) stars was finally recognized .",
    "this , however , presented a puzzle because a low mass star is incapable of the helium fusion needed to create carbon .",
    "this puzzle was resolved by invoking the presence of an evolved , second member of the system  now an undetected white dwarf secondary .",
    "it was assumed that the second member , as it passed through its asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , transferred mass onto a lower mass main sequence star , enriching it in carbon - bearing material ( dahn et al 1977 ) .",
    "the lower mass member was proposed to be a metal - poor subdwarf , and therefore the small amounts of oxygen it does contain in the atmosphere will be overwhelmed by the carbon . a decade after this theory",
    "was advanced , its credibility was strengthened by the discovery of radial velocity variations in g77 - 61 ( indicating an unseen companion ; dearborn et al 1986 ) , and by discoveries of two other dc stars in binaires containing a visual white dwarf secondary ( heber et al 1993 ; liebert et al 1994 ) .",
    "a review of dwarf carbon star research has been given recently by green ( 2000 ) .",
    "the process of making a carbon dwarf may also begin to explain the existence of a rare class of carbon giants known as ch stars .",
    "ch stars are halo members with peculiar abundances , c / o @xmath2 1 , and a strong overabundance of s - process elements thought to be produced during an agb phase .",
    "interestingly , they are all in known binary systems , and those with derived mass ratios are consistent with white dwarf secondaries . as such , these giant stars may represent the dc s at a more advanced evolutionary state ( mcclure 1984 ; wallerstein & knapp 1998 ) .",
    "current understanding of dc s is , however , limited by the small number of such objects now recognized . only as more",
    "dc s are found can we fully test the current hypotheses and understand the role of dc s in the overall picture of stellar evolution .",
    "fortunately , large areal photometric surveys are beginning to uncover these objects in larger numbers .",
    "margon et al ( 2002 ) have reported the discovery of 39 faint high - latitude carbon stars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , of which 17 exhibit proper motions exceeding their three - sigma astrometric uncertainties and are assumed to be dc s . in this paper",
    "we report the first two dc s uncovered by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "from an analysis of multi - epoch digitized sky survey ( dss ) images lying within 25 degrees of the galactic plane , lpine , shara & rich ( 2002 ; hereafter lsr02 ) published a list of objects having proper motions larger than 0.5@xmath3/yr and magnitudes down to r=19.8 mag . their list , although a rediscovery of many objects tabulated in the luyten half - second catalogue ( luyten 1979 ) , also included 141 new proper motion stars not recognized previously .",
    "approximately forty percent of those objects fall in the 2mass second incremental data release ( cutri et al 2000 ) , so their characteristics can be studied via diagrams employing the b and r data from the dss as well as the jhk@xmath4 data from 2mass . in looking at the colors of these objects we noticed that one , lsr2105 + 2514 ( 21:05:16:58,+25:14:48.1 ; j2000 ) , has a very red j@xmath5k@xmath4 color ( 1.28 ) like a late - m or early - l dwarf ( table 1 ) but an r@xmath5j color ( 1.6 ) that is far too blue for such a dwarf . a finder chart for this object",
    "is shown in lsr02 .",
    "we observed lsr 2105 + 2514 spectroscopically on 07 aug 2002 ut using the double spectrograph ( oke & gunn 1982 ) on the hale 5-meter telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "our instrumental setup used the d68 dichroic to split the light between the two channels at @xmath66800  . a 300 lines / mm grating was used in the blue arm and a 316 lines / mm grating in the red arm with grating tilts that provided a few hundred angstroms of duplicate coverage between the two arms .",
    "this provided continuous wavelength coverage from 3800 to 9100  .",
    "use of a 20 slit resulted in a resolution of 8  .",
    "observations were reduced using standard techniques following kirkpatrick , henry , & mccarthy ( 1991 ) and flux calibrated using the standard star feige 110 ( hamuy et al 1994 ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the strong bands of c@xmath0 at 4382 , 4737 , 5165 , 5636 , and 6191   are easily recognizable , indicating that this is a carbon star . the high proper motion measured by lsr02 of 0.563@xmath3/yr along with its magnitudes of b=18.7@xmath70.5 and r=16.1@xmath70.5",
    "indicate that lsr 2105 + 2514 is a dwarf star and not a background giant .      in a given volume of space ,",
    "carbon dwarfs are believed to greatly outnumber carbon giants and as such should be the dominant type of carbon star in the galaxy ( green 2000 ) . nonetheless , few dc s are catalogued . before the 17 dc s recently announced by margon et al ( 2002 ) , previous discoveries only dribbled in since the 1970 s .",
    "table 1 gives a list of all known dwarf carbon stars known as of this writing .",
    "only three of the carbon dwarfs in table 1 have known distances , and the faint magnitudes and presumably larger distances of many of the others may preclude a robust trigonmetric parallax determination . lsr 2105 + 2514 is bright enough that it has already been added to the usno parallax program . even without a @xmath8 ,",
    "however , we can place a crude upper limit to its distance based on its measured proper motion of 0@xmath9563/yr and @xmath10 ( lsr02 ) . assuming that lsr 2105 + 2514 is gravitationally bound in the galaxy",
    ", it can not exceed an escape velocity of @xmath6 500 km / s ( carney , latham , & laird 1988 ) .",
    "we then calculate expected ( u , v , w ) motions , stepping out in distance assuming v@xmath11 . we have transformed those velocities to galactic motions using a solar motion of ( 9 , 11 , 6 ) and assuming a rotational velocity of 220 km / s for the local standard of rest . lsr2105 + 2514 has a total velocity exceeding 500 km / s if the distance exceeds 200 parsecs .",
    "that suggests that lsr2105 + 2514 has m@xmath12 6.7 mag .",
    "this would indicate a lower luminosity carbon dwarf than any of the ones with a measured @xmath8 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this suggestion is seemingly supported by its red j@xmath5k@xmath4 color of 1.28 , which indicates it is also one of the coolest carbon dwarfs .",
    "currently , the only way to distinguish between a carbon dwarf and a carbon giant is through its luminosity , and hence one needs a measure of the parallax or an indirect distance indicator such as proper motion . to date , discriminators based on spectroscopy or photometry have been proposed , but none has met with 100% success .    to define a list of carbon dwarf candidates , we have chosen the list of 36,085 nltt objects ( luyten 1980 ) that gould & salim ( 2002 ) have cross - referenced against the 2mass 2nd incremental data release . if we plot known carbon dwarfs on an r@xmath5j vs. j@xmath5k@xmath4 diagram along with objects from the nltt , we find that carbon dwarfs generally have much redder j@xmath5k@xmath4 colors than the cloud of main sequence stars at similar r@xmath5j colors ( figure 2 ) .",
    "examining the infrared spectra of carbon dwarfs in joyce ( 1998 ) , we find shallow cn bands at r and k along with the k - band co absorptions that are normally in low - mass stars , but a defining characteristic of these carbon dwarfs are large cn absorption bands at j. this results in bluer r@xmath5j and redder j@xmath5k@xmath4 colors than main - sequence objects of similar temperature . exploring objects from the nltt in this part of color space should increase the sample size of known carbon dwarfs .    objects with infrared colors are often placed on ( j@xmath5h)/(h@xmath5k@xmath4 ) to decipher between the giant and dwarf populations . unfortunately ,",
    "as margon et al 2002 comments and figure 3 demonstrates , some of the carbon dwarfs have j@xmath5h colors like giants , and therefore , cannnot be distinguished using this diagram alone .",
    "likewise , there are a few unusual giants that fall in the lower half of the diagram along with the bulk of the dwarfs .",
    "it is therefore important to search for _ spectroscopic _ indicators that might help us understand if these differences are due to temperature or abundance effects and possibly differentiate carbon dwarfs from carbon giants .",
    "using the r@xmath5j vs. j@xmath5k@xmath4 selection criteria outlined above and in the caption to figure 2 , we have identified and observed several nltt carbon dwarf candidates .",
    "lp 758 - 43 , with r@xmath5j@xmath132.0 and j@xmath5k@xmath4=1.10 , was observed on 2002 sep 26 ut with the multi - aperture red spectrograph ( mars ) on the kpno mayall 4 m telescope .",
    "we used the vb8050 - 450 grating and 2.0@xmath3-wide long slit , covering the wavelength range 5600 to 10000   at a resolution of @xmath69 .",
    "the data were reduced and wavelength calibrated using standard techniques in iraf , and flux calibrated through observations of the spectrophotometric standard feige 110 . the spectrum of lp 758 - 43 is plotted in figure 1 and compared with other known carbon dwarfs .",
    "the cn bands appear very similar in depth to the previously known carbon dwarfs .",
    "a finding chart for lp 758 - 43 is presented in figure 4 .",
    "other candidates which turned out to be close doubles , mismatches with reddened stars , a white dwarf / red dwarf binary and m dwarfs will be summarized in the complete survey ( lowrance et al 2003 , in prep ) .    with k@xmath4=11.90 ,",
    "lp 758 - 43 is one of the brighter examples of a dc ( see table 1 ) , enabling future trigonometric parallax measurements . without a @xmath8 , we can attempt to place a crude upper limit to the distance using the arguments used for lsr 2105 + 2514 . for its measured proper motion of 0.255@xmath3/yr and @xmath14 not to exceed the escape velocity of @xmath6500 km / s , its distance would be no greater than @xmath6360 pc with a m@xmath15 4.1 mag .",
    "the j - k@xmath4 color of lp 758 - 43 ( j - k@xmath4=1.1 ) is redder than the average j - k@xmath4 color ( j - k@xmath4=0.95 ) of the three carbon dwarfs with known distances .",
    "those three have an average m@xmath16 6.5 mag , so if we assume lp 758 - 43 has a similar or fainter absolute magnitude at k@xmath4 , it is more likely located at less than 120 pc .",
    "we present the optical spectra of two newly discovered carbon dwarfs , lsr 2105 + 2514 and lp 758 - 43 , with proper motions of 0.563@xmath3/yr and 0.255@xmath3/yr , respectively .",
    "both objects were selected based on their unusual optical to infrared colors and lie in a locus on the optical/ near - infrared color - color diagram populated by other known carbon dwarfs . looking through proper motion catalogs - where it is assured that faint objects are nearby dwarfs and not background giants - for objects of similar color will allow us to produce lists of carbon dwarf candidates for spectroscopic follow - up . finding more carbon dwarfs ,",
    "of which only 31 are currently known , can help us understand the role of dc s in stellar evolution .",
    "finally , broadening the sample will allow a search for spectroscopic discriminants that could help distinguish between carbon dwarfs and carbon giants .",
