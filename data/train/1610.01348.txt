    "the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) is ground - based facility project , which will observe the very high energy ( vhe , @xmath0 gev ) @xmath1-ray sky @xcite .",
    "it will be an imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) instrument with 10 times better sensitivity and improved angular resolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) , compared to the present iact installations such as magic , veritas and h.e.s.s .",
    "cta is designed as an array of a large number of telescopes of 3 different types , comprising a few large size telescopes ( lsts , 23-meter diameter ) , several dozens of medium size telescopes ( msts with diameters of 1012 meters ) and @xmath370 small size telescopes ( ssts , 4-meter diameter ) .",
    "this will allow us to perform observations in a wide energy range from a few tens of gev to more than 100 tev .",
    "the cta observatory will comprise two arrays , one in each hemisphere for full coverage of the sky .    as a part of the cta project , a dual - mirror end - to - end prototype of the small size telescope ( sst-2 m ) is under undergoing commissioning activities within the framework of the astri project of the italian ministry of research and education led by the italian national institute of astrophysics ( inaf ) @xcite .",
    "the prototype was recently inaugurated in italy ( mount etna , sicily ) @xcite . the innovative dual - mirror schwarzschild - couder optical design @xcite implemented for the astri telescopes allows us to reduce the size and the weight of the cherenkov camera and to adopt silicon photo - multipliers as light detectors . in cooperation with the universidade de sao paulo ( brazil ) and the north - west university ( south africa )",
    ", this project also foresees the construction of a mini - array of 9 astri sst-2 m units with a relative distance of about 300 m ( astri mini - array ) .",
    "the astri mini - array will possibly be one of the precursors for the cta southern array .",
    "an improved sensitivity above 10 tev with respect to the current iacts ( @xmath32.5 times better than that of h.e.s.s .  at 30 tev ) , together with an angular resolution of few arc minutes and energy resolution of 1015% will make the astri mini - array a very promising facility for observations of bright known galactic and extragalactic objects at energies up to few hundreds of tev .",
    "in addition , astri mini - array will cover relatively large area on the sky due to the @xmath310@xmath4 field of view of each dual - mirror astri sst-2 m telescope @xcite .",
    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) are very interesting targets for @xmath1-ray observations with iacts .",
    "such objects correspond to the most abundant classes of galactic vhe sources .",
    "they comprise regions where particles are accelerated up to relativistic energies .",
    "cta and the astri mini - array will be able to carry out more detailed observations of these sources as compared to present generation of iacts and will shed more light on the problem of the origin of the galactic cosmic rays ( cr ) .",
    "in this work we investigated the scientific capabilities of cta and the astri mini - array , simulating vhe observations of the vela pwn and two snrs  young rcw 86 and evolved w 28 . making a number of assumptions",
    ", we examine resolving capabilities of these instruments observing extended sources such as the vela pwn and snr w 28 , the detectability of the vela pulsar .",
    "we also checked if the astri mini - array will be able to discriminate between hadronic and leptonic nature of the @xmath1-ray emission from snr rcw 86 .",
    "we perform simulations using different software packages such as _ ctools _  ( see @xcite and http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools/ ) and _ astrisim _  ( for more details see http://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/~giuliani/astrisim/ ) .",
    "cta observations of the vela x region are simulated with the software _ ctools _ , whereas the astri mini - array simulations of vela x , rcw 86 and w 28 are carried out using an alternative package _ astrisim _ , which is developed by the astri collaboration .",
    "the _ ctools _  simulations of the vela x region are performed for the complete southern cta installation ( cta - south ) .",
    "this array contains 4 lsts , 24 msts and 72 ssts .",
    "instrument response functions ( irfs ) of cta - south available at https://portal.cta-observatory.org/pages/cta-performance.aspx are calculated using mc - prod2 simulations of a 50-hour observation of a point source with a flux of 1 crab unit ( @xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 tev@xmath7 ) , located at 20@xmath8 zenith angle and at the center of the field of view ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we use the tool ` ctobssim ` to perform the simulations and obtain the event lists of the observations , whereas the tool ` ctbin `  to convert them into count maps .",
    "residual maps are obtained using the tool ` csresmap ` . with this tool",
    "we subtract the background modeled with ` ctmodel ` from the simulated sky - map .",
    "the tool ` csresmap ` was used with an algorithm ` sub ` ( for more details see http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools/reference_manual/csresmap.html ) .",
    "the spectral fit of the simulated data have been done with the ` ctlike ` tool in unbinned mode . using ` ctlike `",
    "we estimate also the significance of each source in the model , performing a maximum likelihood analysis of the simulated cta data .",

    "in contrast to previous h.e.s.s .  studies @xcite , significant extended emission out of the x - ray cocoon ( `` wings '' ) was found .",
    "this challenged the theoretical leptonic scenario ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which explains multiwavelength emission from vela x due to the presence of two population of leptons : ( i ) the first population of energetic particles produces synchrotron x - ray and inverse compton ( ic ) vhe photons inside the cocoon and ( 2 ) the second population of low - energy particles produces synchrotron radio and gev @xmath1-ray photons due to ic outside the cocoon ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some models consider the emission of accelerated hadrons ( @xmath12-decay ) as the main mechanism of the vhe emission from the cocoon ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another problem is to explain the lack of variations of vhe spectra measured by h.e.s.s .  in the inner and outer parts of the vela pwn .",
    "future , more detailed spectral and morphological investigations of vela x with cta and the astri mini - array will be very important for improving our understanding of this source and clarifying the nature of its broadband emission ( leptonic or hadronic origin ) .    to simulate the vhe emission from the vela x region , we define the spatial and spectral models of all sources in this area of the sky ( see table [ tab:4.1 ] ) .",
    "the vela pulsar is simulated as a point source with a power - law spectrum obtained from the analysis of the 5 years of the _",

    "to define the spatial model of the extended vela x emission , we created radio and x - ray templates , adopting archival high - resolution observations of most and rosat telescopes obtained during the second molongo galactic plane survey @xcite and the rosat all sky survey @xcite , respectively .",
    "following abramowski et al .",
    "@xcite , we assumed that the vhe emission from the vela pwn is produced by the same leptonic populations , which are responsible for the x - ray cocoon emission and radio extended `` wings '' , and that the vela pwn morphology can be approximated by the superposition of the radio ( 65% in flux ) and x - ray ( 35% in flux ) spatial maps .",
    "we then select circular and ring regions in both the x - ray and radio templates ( for more details see table [ tab:4.1 ] and @xcite ) and perform analysis of the vela pwn simulating circular and ring regions of our templates with different power - law with exponential cut - off models ( plec ) , which were obtained by h.e.s.s .  in the 0.75 - 70 tev energy range @xcite .",

    "the vela pwn will be detected ( 5@xmath44 ) in about 10 min with cta and in a few hours with the astri mini - array .",

    "we obtained that these two components can be distinguished with cta , if the contribution from either the radio or x - ray population is more than 10% of the total vhe flux of vela x. such detailed observations will improve our understanding of the nature of the vela x extended emission .",
