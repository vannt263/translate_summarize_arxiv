    "when low- and intermediate - mass stars evolve along the asymptotic giant branch where double shell burning of he and h takes place in the interior , the he burning becomes unstable and gives rise to periodic thermonuclear runaway ( `` thermal pulse '' or `` he shell flash '' ) , which induces mixing of newly synthesized @xmath9c and other processed materials at the surface ( third dredge - up , iben 1975 ; sugimoto & nomoto 1975 ) . the mixing gradually enhances the surface abundance of carbon , which will eventually turn a star originally oxygen - rich in the surface chemical composition into a carbon star ( cf . iben & renzini 1983 ) .    among cool luminous carbon stars , there are a group of stars that show silicate dust emission features in the mid - infrared at 10 and 18  @xmath10 m ( little - marenin 1986 ; willems & de jong 1986 ) ; these are the so - called `` silicate carbon '' stars .",
    "silicates are the signature of oxygen - rich chemistry in their circumstellar dust shells , while their optical spectra dominated by molecular absorption bands of c@xmath11 and cn show that their atmospheres are carbon - rich .",
    "the oxygen - rich chemistry in their circumstellar envelopes is also confirmed in the gas - phase by the detection of water vapor masers at 22  ghz ( benson & little - marenin 1987 ; nakada et al .",
    "even carbon - rich objects showing crystalline silicate features have been discovered ( waters et al .",
    "1998 ; molster et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the intriguing co - existence of oxygen - rich and carbon - rich chemistries in a single system prompted two hypothetical explanations .",
    "one was the binary system consisting of a carbon star and a dust - enshrouded m - type giant ( oh / ir ) star ( benson & little - marenin 1987 ; little - marenin , benson , & dickinson 1988 ) .",
    "the other was more interesting , i.e. , that we are witnessing a brief evolutionary stage where the star is in transition from an oxygen - rich star to a carbon star by the third dredge - up while the remnant oxygen - rich dust shell is still visible ( willems & de jong 1986 , 1988 ) .",
    "these earlier pictures were , however , discarded based on the absence of both spectroscopic signatures of a luminous m - type ( oh / ir ) companion ( noguchi et al . 1990 ; lambert , hinkle & smith 1990 ) and variability of the color - indices and silicate features ( chan & kwok 1988 ; lloyd - evans 1990 ) as well as a stringent requirement that primary and secondary must have very similar masses ( lambert et al . 1990 ) .",
    "near - infrared speckle interferometry as well as water maser monitoring also ruled out the presence of a luminous m - type companion to the primary carbon star ( engels & leinert 1994 ) among silicate carbon stars .",
    "morris ( 1987 ) suggested that a binary system of a mass - losing red giant star and either a main - sequence dwarf or a white dwarf companion can develop an accretion disk around the companion , sometimes a circumbinary disk , and even a circum - primary disk , depending on the system configuration .",
    "lloyd - evans ( 1990 ) was inspired by morris s picture to propose that in silicate carbon stars the oxygen - rich material accumulated in a disk around a hypothetical companion when the primary was an oxygen - rich mass - losing star , which later turned into a carbon star through the third dredge - up .",
    "this picture reconciles the observed red infrared color and the relatively small extinction in the optical .",
    "the disk should be somewhat thickened and may extend to the circumbinary region to provide a sufficient mid - infrared flux .",
    "engels & leinert ( 1994 ) inferred for v778  cyg and eu  and a minimum radius of the molecular reservoir where water masers reside of 45  sin  @xmath12  au , where @xmath12 denotes the inclination of the reservoir , which is 90@xmath13 when seen edge - on , based on the assumed mass of 1  @xmath14 for the primary , keplerian motion for the maser components , and the constancy of radial velocities of the maser lines .",
    "kahane et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and jura & kahane ( 1999 ) proposed the existence of a circumbinary reservoir in keplerian motion in silicate carbon stars , bm  gem and eu  and , on the basis of the detection of co j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 emission with very narrow widths at their systemic velocities .",
    "they suggested that the silicate grains reside in the reservoir , which was presumably built by the influence of a postulated unseen companion when the primary was an oxygen - rich giant .",
    "waters et al .",
    "( 1998 ) noted the similarity to silicate carbon stars of red rectangle that possesses a circumbinary disk showing crystalline silicate features , an extended carbon - rich outflow , and narrow co emission lines .",
    "however , yamamura et al . ( 2000 ) suggested a picture similar to that reported by lloyd - evans ( 1990 ) based on analysis of the iso spectrum of another silicate carbon star , v778  cyg .",
    "they found that dust grains in the circumbinary region where the grains can be warm enough to emit the silicate features will be blown out in less than one orbital period , and thus unable to form a circumbinary reservoir .",
    "they concluded that the source of the silicate features must be the oxygen - rich material continuously blown out from the disk around a companion by the primary s wind and radiation pressure .",
    "the above scenarios all postulate a low - mass , low - luminosity companion , although no observational evidence has yet been provided . to gain further understanding of silicate carbon stars , it is essential to determine whether they indeed have a companion star .",
    "it would be very difficult , however , to detect a postulated low - luminosity companion in the optical or longer wavelength bands because the primary carbon star must outshine the companion by many orders of magnitude in these wavelength regions . in this respect",
    ", it has long been known that cool carbon stars exhibit extreme violet flux deficiency ( shane 1928 ) , the agent of which has not yet been unambiguously identified ( `` violet opacity problem '' ) . indeed ,",
    "cool carbon stars are very dim in the violet region ; e.g. , @xmath15 of the carbon star y  cvn is 8.9 ( nicolet 1978 ) , while those of m5 giants and dwarfs are 4.2 and 2.8 , respectively ( allen 1976 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be exploited to search for signatures of companions to silicate carbon stars in the violet spectral region .",
    "therefore , we performed high sensitivity spectroscopic observations of the visually brightest silicate - carbon stars bm  gem , v778  cyg , and eu  and , in the violet spectral region .",
    "while we saw no significant violet emission in v778  cyg or eu  and , we have detected a featureless continuum below 4000  in bm  gem , where the balmer continuum is higher than the paschen continuum at the balmer limit , which is very unusual for a cool luminous carbon star .",
    "in addition , the balmer series lines were traced from h@xmath0 up to h@xmath1 and they showed distinct p cygni - type profiles .",
    "the profiles give a gas expansion velocity of at least 400 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "such a high velocity outflow has never been observed in any type of currently mass - losing carbon star .",
    "additional observations 75 days later further revealed considerable time variability of the balmer lines .",
    "in addition , the bm  gem system was found to be similar to the mira ( @xmath8  cet ) system , which is the prototype of a binary system consisting of a luminous agb star ( mira  a ) and a low - mass , low - luminosity companion ( mira  b ) . in the following sections , we discuss the origin of the continuum emission and the p cygni - type balmer lines , and argue for the presence of a companion to bm  gem .",
    "observations of bm  gem , the brightest silicate carbon star in the visual region , were made with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) at the nasmyth focus of the subaru telescope ( kaifu et al .",
    "2000 ; iye et al .",
    "2004 ) on january 29 and april 14 , 2001 .",
    "we used the atmospheric dispersion corrector for the optical nasmyth focus .",
    "the entrance slit width was set to 360  @xmath10 m ( @xmath16 ) , which corresponded to a resolution of @xmath450,000 .",
    "a quartz glass filter was inserted behind the slit .",
    "hds is equipped with two mosaiced ccds from eev with 2048@xmath174100 pixels of 13.5  @xmath10 m square .",
    "we used the 250  grooves  mm@xmath2 cross - disperser grating to observe the range between 35505200  ( 35504350  and 44005200  ) .",
    "we made two 30-minute exposures and one 30-minute exposure in january and april , respectively .",
    "a bright j - type carbon star , y  cvn , was also observed for 15 minutes on february 1 , 2001 ( ut ) with the same settings for comparison , because all the silicate carbon stars examined spectroscopically were known to be j - type stars ( lloyd - evans 1990 ) , which have low @xmath9c/@xmath18c abundance ratios ( @xmath19 ) in the atmosphere ( bouigue 1954 ) .",
    "we also observed the second and third brightest silicate carbon stars , v778  cyg and eu  and , for 40 minutes each on july 30 , 2001 with almost the same settings but we employed a slit width of @xmath20 and 2@xmath172 binning for the ccd readout to attain as high a signal to noise ratio as possible , which gave an effective spectral resolution of @xmath438,000 .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the last column shows the signal to noise ratio at around 4000  in the reduced one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the photometric and astrometric data of the targets taken from the literature are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the second and third columns show the hipparcos parallax and the uncertainty in the parallax ( esa 1997 ) , respectively . near infrared data in the sixth through tenth columns",
    "are from noguchi et al .",
    "( 1981 ) for bm  gem and y  cvn and from noguchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for v778  cyg and eu  and . @xmath21 and @xmath22 magnitudes are from the hipparcos and tycho catalogs ( esa 1997 ) for bm  gem and y  cvn , and from alksnis & zaime(1993 ) for v778  cyg and eu  and .",
    "data reduction was performed using the echelle package on noao iraf .",
    "standard procedures were followed : bias subtraction , flat fielding , scattered light subtraction , extraction of one - dimensional spectra , dispersion correction by th - ar lamp spectra , and removal of the echelle blaze profile by continuum lamp spectra .",
    "strong cosmic ray events were removed manually .",
    "we detected significant emission in bm  gem throughout the observed wavelength range .",
    "we then attempted to apply flux calibration to the observed spectra of bm  gem .",
    "a star , feige  34 , observed on january 28 , 2001 under @xmath23 seeing with @xmath24 slit width to let virtually all the incident light enter the spectrograph , was used for our approximate flux calibration .",
    "we derived the system response from the observed spectra of the hot white dwarf feige 34 .",
    "we applied an atmospheric extinction correction based on the mauna kea extinction curve ( beland , boulade & davidge 1988 ) to the spectra , and compared them with the calibrated magnitudes at 50   interval of feige  34 prepared in iraf , which is based on massey et al .",
    "we then corrected the spectra of bm  gem for the atmospheric extinction and the system response .",
    "finally , we applied a correction for light losses from the entrance slit due to seeing .",
    "seeing size was measured to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 for january and april observations , respectively .",
    "we approximated the seeing image by a single gaussian and obtained values of 0.71 and 0.68 for the slit transmission efficiency for january and april , respectively , against @xmath16 slit width assuming perfect telescope guiding .",
    "the spectra of y  cvn were also calibrated in the same manner for comparison .",
    "the seeing size at the observation of y  cvn was @xmath25 , which gave a slit efficiency of 0.71 .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux densities thus obtained is non - negligible because the data were taken on different nights with somewhat different seeings with a slit width close to the size of the seeing image , a flux standard was observed on only one night , and the violet region is near the atmospheric cutoff , which is sensitive to extinction corrections .",
    "the uncertainty due to seeing and guiding , which applies to bm  gem , is estimated to be @xmath270.25 mag in each spectrum , adopting maximum possible errors of @xmath28 in both seeing estimate and guiding",
    ". the uncertainty in the extinction correction which applies to both bm  gem and feige  34 can give rise to an underestimate in their brightness of about 0.2 mag .",
    "it is obtained by assuming the employed extinction coefficient of 0.37 mag  airmass@xmath2 at 3600 ( beland et al .",
    "1988 ) , with smaller values for longer wavelengths , was subject to a possible increase of 50% , although all our observations were made under clear sky conditions and the airmasses were only 1.01 , 1.20 , and 1.10 for bm  gem(jan ) , bm  gem(apr ) , and feige  34 , respectively .",
    "taking all these uncertainties into account , each flux density derived is likely to be accompanied by an uncertainty range of ( -0.45 , + 0.25 ) , while the relative uncertainty between bm  gem(apr ) and bm  gem(jan ) can be as large as 0.7(=0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2 ) .",
    "any difference between the two observations smaller than this magnitude is dominated by a calibration error and should be treated as insignificant .",
    "we did not apply the above flux calibration to either v778  cyg or eu  and because we did not see any significant emission in the region shortward of 4000  .",
    "these stars are 3 magnitudes fainter than bm  gem in @xmath21 ( table 2 ) .",
    "if we put bm  gem farther away from us so that its @xmath21 becomes 3 mag fainter , then any signal of the violet continuum on the raw ccd image becomes only one - quarter or less of the ccd read noise and merely equal to it or less even in the case of 2@xmath172 binning .",
    "then , the non - detection of the violet continua here in v778  cyg and eu  and indicates that they are not as bright as that of bm  gem for their @xmath21 magnitudes . nevertheless , it does not necessarily mean that they do not have a similar violet continuum .",
    "it is necessary to achieve much higher sensitivities for v778  cyg and eu  and to distinguish between the presence and absence of a continuum like that in bm  gem .",
    "we will not discuss the violet spectra of v778  cyg or eu  and further in this paper .",
    "the observed spectrum was corrected for the doppler shift and transformed to the wavelength scale with respect to the local standard of rest (  lsr \" ) using the tasks rvcorrect and dopcor in iraf .",
    "the stellar systemic velocity with respect to lsr was also subtracted in the final spectra shown in this paper .",
    "thus , matter stationary to the center of mass of the system should appear at zero velocity .",
    "we employed the systemic velocity of 73.2 km  s@xmath2 ( v@xmath29 ) for bm  gem based on mm - wave co emission lines ( kahane et al .",
    "1998 ; jura & kahane 1999 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with v@xmath29 of 74.7  km  s@xmath2 derived from the heliocentric radial velocity of 85.3  @xmath270.4 km  s@xmath2 obtained for the co first overtone bands by lambert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . for y",
    "cvn , we used 21.2  km  s@xmath2 , based on the mm - wave co j=1 - 0 emission ( izumiura , ukita , & tsuji 1995 ) , as the systemic velocity with respect to lsr .",
    "it should be noted that radial velocities of observed spectral lines given below will carry a typical uncertainty of @xmath40.5  km  s@xmath2 on the basis of the observed line widths and strengths , achieved s / n ratio , and employed spectral resolution .",
    "the resulting spectra of bm  gem taken with the ccd that observes the shorter wavelength portion , reduced to a resolution of 1  , are shown in figure 1 along with those of y  cvn .",
    "we have adjusted the vertical scales so that the slopes of the spectra between 4050  and 4200  look similar to one another .",
    "the spectra of bm  gem show significant balmer and paschen continuum emission in the violet region , which is evident when compared with y  cvn , which shows no detectable violet continuum . what is more intriguing is that the level of the balmer continuum is 1.3 times higher than that of the paschen continuum when compared around the balmer limit in both observation occasions .",
    "this indicates that the continuum emission comes from an ionized gas region .",
    "they also show a series of emission lines that are identified with hydrogen balmer series lines from h@xmath0 through h@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the balmer lines show p cygni - type line profiles , suggesting the presence of an outflow being accelerated outward against the central continuum source .",
    "h@xmath30 emission was not identified at all in our spectra recorded on the ccd that covers the longer wavelength part , probably because the spectral range is dominated by the strong carbon star spectra .",
    "broad k emission with a blueward depression was also detected but h emission was absent .",
    "the h emission could be absorbed by the hydrogen in the outflow because the expected wavelength range of h line ( 3968.470  , moore 1959 ) coincides with the absorption core of the p cygni profile of h@xmath3 line ( 3970.074  , moore 1959 ) .",
    "note here that the features that mimic emission lines , marked with small vertical ticks seen shortward of 4150  in y  cvn , are contaminations of ghost spectra of very strong red light of the star , probably due to the cross - disperser grating .",
    "the same ghost features are also present in the spectra of bm  gem at the same positions , by which only h@xmath31 of the balmer lines is significantly contaminated",
    ".    the fluxes per unit wavelength at wavelength @xmath32 , @xmath33 , of the balmer continuum of bm  gem after the approximate flux calibration in  2 are 3.0@xmath1710@xmath34 erg  @xmath35  s@xmath2  @xmath2 in the january spectra and 4.3@xmath1710@xmath34 erg  @xmath35  s@xmath2  @xmath2 in the april spectra immediately shortward of the balmer limit at 3646  .",
    "these correspond to 16.1 mag and 15.7 mag following the definition of @xmath36  log(@xmath37 ) @xmath38 48.59 , where @xmath39 is the magnitude ,",
    "@xmath40 is frequency , and @xmath37 is the flux per unit frequency at @xmath40 in erg  @xmath35  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2 . here , @xmath37 is calculated by @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , where @xmath43 is the speed of light .",
    "this definition gives 0.048 for the magnitude of vega at 5556  ( hayes & latham 1975 ) .",
    "the apparent difference in the continuum level of 0.4 mag is not significant , considering the possible uncertainty of 0.7 mag given in  2 .",
    "thus , we argue that the continuum level is unchanged , and adopt a geometrical mean of the two values , 3.6@xmath1710@xmath34 erg  @xmath35  s@xmath2  @xmath2 or 15.9 mag .",
    "we take the differences of @xmath270.2 mag between this 15.9 mag and the two direct values as an additional uncertainty . adding this to that given in  2",
    ", the total uncertainty range has a magnitude of ( -0.65 , + 0.45 ) .",
    "similarly , the paschen continuum at 4000  has 16.2 mag and 15.6 mag in the january and april spectra , respectively , and they give 15.9 and ( -0.75 , + 0.55 ) in magnitude as the flux level and uncertainty range , respectively .",
    "note , however , that bm  gem shows light variation of 0.20.4 mag in 100 days in @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands ( alksnis & zaime 1993 ) .",
    "whether bm  gem is indeed variable in the violet continuum is an interesting issue for future studies .    in the original high - resolution spectra of bm  gem ,",
    "cn red system lines between 48305250  give average radial velocities around @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 with respect to the systemic velocity adopted in  2 in the two observations .",
    "absorption features of triplet at 4030 - 4034  were identified , while low - excitation lines of were observed in emission shortward of 4040  , both of which are typical for late - n type carbon stars , as described by gilra ( 1976 ) .",
    "the lines at the two epochs give average radial velocities around @xmath45  km  s@xmath2 , which are compatible with the mm wave co outflow velocity of @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 and may suggest that they form in the mass - loss flow of the carbon star .",
    "the lines have apparent fwhms of @xmath410  km  s@xmath2 and show average radial velocities near 0  km  s@xmath2 in the two observations , suggesting that they originate in the extended atmosphere of the carbon star .",
    "the uncertainties in the average radial velocities given above are as large as 1  km  s@xmath2 for all of the cn red system , triplet , and lines . whether this magnitude of uncertainties , which is slightly larger than the internal uncertainties of @xmath47  km  s@xmath2 given in  2 , is due to their intrinsic variabilities or not is an issue for a future work .",
    "the continuum shortward of 4040  is almost featureless except for the balmer and lines .",
    "no absorption features typical of stellar photospheres are seen .",
    "figure 2 shows higher resolution views of the vicinity of h@xmath48 , h@xmath49 , and h@xmath50 lines together with k line observed on the two nights 75 days apart .",
    "the zero systemic velocity corresponds to the middle of the p cygni profile , which argues for the outflowing gas being associated with bm  gem .",
    "the line profiles show that the emitting gas , which is likely ionized , is expanding at a velocity as large as 400 km  s@xmath2 in the sight line . this is greater than the highest velocity outflows observed to date in agb and post - agb stars , v hya ( 200 km  s@xmath2 , knapp , jorissen , & young 1997 ) , crl 618 ( 200 km  s@xmath2 , cernicharo et al .",
    "1989 ) , oh231.8 + 4.2 ( 330 km  s@xmath2 , alcolea , bujarrabal , & snchez contreras 1996 ) , and r coronae borealis stars ( 200350 km  s@xmath2 , clayton , geballe , & bianchi 2003 ) , with the exception of mira  b ( 250 and 400 km  s@xmath2 , wood , karovska , & hack 2001 , wood , karovska , & raymond 2002 ) and v854  cen ( 390 km s@xmath2 , clayton et al .",
    "it is , however , much smaller than those of jets seen in symbiotic objects ( e.g. , @xmath46000 km  s@xmath2 in mwc560 , tomov et al .",
    "in addition , a change in the line shape in each of the balmer lines over a period of 75 days is evident .",
    "the blue edge of the absorption features shifted redward by 200 km  s@xmath2 , while the red edge did so by only 50 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "our discoveries of the balmer and paschen continua , the former being higher than the latter , the p cygni - type balmer series lines , and their line profile variability all suggest that bm  gem is associated with a compact ionized gas region that is accelerated to form a rather spherical , high velocity outflow .",
    "no mechanism is known for a single cool luminous carbon star to produce an ionized gas region as well as a high velocity outflow .",
    "they can , however , be accounted for if we introduce an unseen , low - mass companion that captures matter in the stellar wind from the primary to give rise to an accretion disk .",
    "this hypothesis is partially supported by similar spectral features observed in mira  b ( @xmath8  cet  b ) ( see  4 ) , which is a low - mass companion to the agb star mira  a ( @xmath8  cet  a ) and is considered to be associated with an accretion disk ( joy 1926 , 1954 ; deutsch 1958 ; warner 1972 ; reimers & cassatella 1985 ) .",
    "low - mass companions with an accretion disk have also been suggested for r coronae borealis stars , which show outflows with similar high velocities and lines that require excitation sources ( rao et al .",
    "1993 ; clayton et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "formation of an accretion disk has proven to be robust around a companion star to a mass - losing giant in various detached configurations ( mastrodemos & morris 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the inner part of the accretion disk must be heated by the released gravitational potential energy from the accreting matter .",
    "a hot ionized gas region should form between the innermost region of the disk and the surface of the companion .",
    "the accretion phenomenon may also be responsible for the discovered high velocity , variable outflow , although the details of the acceleration mechanism is not yet settled for this type of outflow .",
    "alternatively , the outflow may be due to dust formation in the circumcompanion region , analogous to the scenario proposed for rcb stars by clayton ( 1996 ) .",
    "dust grains would be accelerated through radiation pressure , dragging gas to form the observed high velocity outflow .",
    "the ionization could then be due to collisional ionization in the flow . in this case , to be compatible with the observed broad absorption core that extends from the systemic velocity to the terminal velocity in the p cygni profile , the ionization must occur before the gas acceleration is completed .",
    "otherwise the absorber in front of the continuum source has terminal outflow velocity and a much narrower absorption component appears near the terminal velocity .",
    "in either case of an outflow powered by accretion or driven by radiation pressure on dust grains , the observed spectral features favor the presence of a companion to bm  gem .",
    "the companion should be either a white dwarf or a low - mass dwarf star because hypotheses invoking a luminous companion have been rejected by previous studies ( noguchi et al .",
    "1990 ; lambert et al . 1990 ; chan & kwok 1988 ; lloyd - evans 1990 ) .",
    "the gas expansion velocity provides a hint to distinguish the candidates for the companion .",
    "white dwarfs have escape velocities on the order of several thousand  km  s@xmath2 , while those of low - mass dwarf stars are of the order of several hundred  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if gas acceleration occurs near the surface of the secondary and the flow is aligned with the sight line , the latter is the case for bm  gem .",
    "however , the former could also be the case if the acceleration takes place at some point distant from the white dwarf , as suggested by warner ( 1972 ) , or the flow has a narrow opening angle and is markedly inclined with respect to the sight line .",
    "below , we examine whether such a binary and accretion hypothesis is plausible energetically .",
    "we first attempted to determine the absolute magnitudes of bm  gem at the observed wavelengths by finding the distance to bm  gem .",
    "although it exists , the hipparcos parallax of bm  gem ( table 2 ) is unreliable .",
    "claussen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) gave 1.51 kpc assuming that carbon stars have a constant absolute k - band magnitude of -8.1 .",
    "we made another estimate by comparing the near - infrared flux densities of bm  gem with those of y  cvn , as they are @xmath18c - rich ( j - type ) carbon stars resembling each other in the spectral characteristics in the optical and near - infrared ( barnbaum 1991 ; ohnaka & tsuji 1999 , yamamura et al .",
    "2000 ) , which may indicate they have similar intrinsic properties .",
    "y  cvn is the only j - type star that has a relatively reliable hipparcos parallax ( table 2 ) of 218 pc with 16% uncertainty .",
    "it is evident from the data shown in table 2 that the differences between y  cvn and bm  gem in @xmath51 through @xmath52 bands are quite constant with a simple mean of 3.72 , which indeed shows the two stars to be similar and gives a distance to bm  gem of 1.21 kpc .",
    "in addition , the distance of 1.51 kpc reported by calussen et al . may be reduced to 1.14 kpc , considering the distance they gave of 0.29 kpc for y  cvn should be readjusted to 0.218 kpc .",
    "hence , we adopted 1.2 kpc with a conservative uncertainty factor of 1.2 as a reasonable estimate for the distance to bm  gem .",
    "the total luminosity then becomes 5.4@xmath53 ( cf .",

    "then , we find @xmath70 , which should be an upper limit because the column denisity that heiles ( 1975 ) gave is an upper limit to bm gem , which lies somewhere between the boundary of the hi gas distribution in that direction and us . since there are no significant molecular clouds found in the direction of bm gem ( e.g. , dame , hartmann , & thaddeus 2001 ) , @xmath60 should be close to unity and the use of @xmath69 should be justified .",

    "this is another upper limit because bm gem must lie somewhere between the boundary of the dust distribution in the sight line and us .",
    "taking these into account we adopt the 0.3 mag directly from far - inrared dust observations as a nominal value , the 0.6 mag from the observations as a maximum value , and no extinction as a minimum value , for @xmath57 to bm  gem , namely , @xmath74 .",

    "the probable range of @xmath77 between + 6.3 and + 3.9 corresponds to a photosphere with a spectral type between late g and late f , which should show numerous strong absorption lines in the violet region .",
    "the violet continuum of bm  gem is , however , featureless except for the emission lines due to the primary carbon star and the balmer series lines due to the outflow , as mentioned in section 3.1 .",
    "the featureless continuum requires that the companion s photosphere is smeared by veiling with / without obscuration and contributes only a small fraction of the observed violet continuum .",
    "considering the s / n ratios in the original high - resolution spectra of @xmath415 , we should be able to detect absorption lines of which central depths are as weak as 20% of the continuum level at 3 @xmath82 confidence . in this violet region",

    ", the veiling should be at least 4 times the companion s photosphere .",
    "possible cases are an f- or g - type dwarf obscured by continuous absorption and covered with veiling and a dwarf later than g - type either obscured or not by continuous absorption and covered with veiling .",
    "obscured b- or a - type photosphere is not plausible for the violet continuum because we do not see the balmer jump typical for such spectral types and because the companion should be less massive than the primary carbon star .",
    "the observed violet continuum also can not be explained by the photosphere of a white dwarf companion , because the @xmath75 band brightness , @xmath76 , of a db white dwarf with effective temperature of 25000  k is 9.1 ( allen 1976 ) , and those classified as da and later are less luminous .",
    "therefore , most of the observed violet flux in bm  gem should have an origin other than the photosphere of the assumed companion , which is consistent with our accretion hypothesis .",

    "these approximations should be valid because model spectra of ionized gas show that the continuum emission diminishes rapidly toward higher frequencies with respect to @xmath88 line and because the level of the continuum flux per unit wavelength from an ionized gas at @xmath96 wavelength is similar to that just shortward in wavelength of the balmer limit ( e.g. , harrington , lutz , & seaton 1981 ; pottasch et al .",

    "this argues for a dwarf as the companion of bm  gem .",
    "however , that both mira and bm  gem possess a white dwarf companion can not be excluded completely , because there may exist a mechanism that suppresses the x - ray luminosity arising from the accretion process and one to accelerate the outflow from some distant point from the white dwarf simultaneously .",
    "the latter mechanism is favorable for the picture suggested for mira  b by warner ( 1972 ) .",
    "it is thus difficult to choose exclusively between a dwarf and a white dwarf as the companion , although the data favor a dwarf .",

    "the separation is found to be ( 60.3)@xmath141  au for a dwarf companion , while that for a white dwarf companion is ( 51)@xmath142  au to reproduce the observed luminosity of 0.030.6  @xmath5 using equation  ( 5 ) .",

    "the observation that mira  b , which is at least 70  au from mira  a , is associated with an accretion disk despite the moderate mass loss rate of mira  a of @xmath136  yr@xmath2 suggests that the current hydrodynamic simulations do not constrain the upper - limit of the separation very well .",

    "they concluded that a circumstellar disk around an invisible companion should be the reservoir of oxygen - rich material , because they found it difficult to locate a circumbinary disk in the vicinity of the companion s orbit .",
    "dust grains there will be swept outward in less than one orbital period by radiation pressure from the primary .",
    "they speculated that the silicate features originate from oxygen - rich material continuously blown out by radiation pressure of the primary from the circumcompanion disk that was built when the primary was an oxygen - rich mass - losing star .",

    "this location is compatible with the binary separation for a dwarf companion , but not with the separation for a white dwarf companion .",
    "finally , it should be noted that all of the silicate carbon stars examined spectroscopically are known to be j - type stars ( lloyd - evans 1990 , 1991 ) , while the opposite is not true .",
    "it has been argued that j - type carbon stars are the direct descendants of r - type carbon stars ( lloyd - evans 1990 ; lambert et al .",

    "abia & isern ( 2000 ) , however , favor another scenario in which the low - mass j - type stars discussed here form via a combination of non - standard extra mixing and cool bottom processing ( wasserburg , boothroyd , & sackmann 1995 ) early on the agb , which is consistent with their luminosities being similar to those of normal cool carbon stars on the agb ( wallerstein & knapp 1998 ; alksnis et al .",
    "as there seems to be a connection between the j - type nature and the silicate features , the presence of a companion to bm  gem would suggest a possible connection between binarity and j - type phenomena , which is worth investigating further .",
    "radial velocity monitoring of j - type stars would be important , which could be carried out by observing the emission lines in the violet region as well as numerous photospheric molecular absorption lines .",
    "we observed the violet spectra of the three brightest silicate carbon stars , bm  gem , v778  cyg , and eu  and , using the high dispersion spectrograph on the subaru telescope , and used a prototypical j - type carbon star y  cvn for comparison .",

    "the luminosity of the observed continuum emission is estimated to be @xmath40.2 ( 0.030.6 )  @xmath5 , while the silicate dust features convey about 110 @xmath5 , which shows that the silicate dust grains are heated not by the phenomenon discovered here but by radiation from the carbon star .",
    "we found that the violet continuum luminosity is accommodated if an accretion rate on the order of @xmath158  yr@xmath2 is achieved to a dwarf companion , while @xmath159  yr@xmath2 is sufficient to a white dwarf companion .",

    "the possibility of a white dwarf companion , however , can not be ruled out , because the outflow could be narrow and inclined with respect to the sight line or be accelerated at some distant point from the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "based on the above findings combined with those of previous studies , we conclude that bm  gem is associated with a low - mass , low - luminosity companion giving rise to an accretion disk .",
    "we note that the spectral features and uv - optical luminosity obtained for the bm  gem system closely resemble those of the mira system , which should represent the actual similarity between the binary configurations of the two systems .",

    "<S> balmer and paschen continuum emission as well as balmer series lines of p cygni - type profile from h@xmath0 through h@xmath1 are revealed in the violet spectra of bm  gem , a carbon star associated with an oxygen - rich circumstellar shell ( `` silicate carbon star '' ) observed with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the blue - shifted absorption in the balmer lines indicates the presence of an outflow , the line of sight velocity of which is at least 400 km  s@xmath2 , which is the highest outflow velocity observed to date in a carbon star . </S>",
    "<S> the balmer lines showed a significant change in profile over a period of 75 days . </S>",
    "<S> strong k emission was also detected , while h emission , where h@xmath3 overlapped , was absent on both observation occasions . </S>",
    "<S> violet spectra of the other two silicate carbon stars , v778  cyg and eu  and , and of the prototypical j - type carbon star , y  cvn , were also observed , but none of these were detected in either continuum emission below 4000  or balmer lines . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the observed unusual features in bm  gem are strong evidence for the presence of a companion , which should form an accretion disk that gives rise to both an ionized gas region and a high velocity , variable outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated luminosity of @xmath40.2 ( 0.03 - 0.6 ) @xmath5 for the ionized gas can be maintained by a mass accretion rate to a dwarf companion of @xmath6  yr@xmath2 , while @xmath7  yr@xmath2 is sufficient for accretion to a white dwarf companion . </S>",
    "<S> these accretion rates are feasible for some detached binary configurations on the basis of the bond - hoyle type accretion process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we concluded that the carbon star bm  gem is in a detached binary system with a companion of low mass and low luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are unable to determine whether this companion object is a dwarf or a white dwarf , although the gas outflow velocity of 400  km  s@xmath2 as well as the non - detection in the x - ray survey favor its identity as a dwarf star . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limits for binary separation are 210  au and 930  au for a dwarf and a white dwarf , respectively , in the case of circular orbit . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the observed features of bm  gem mimic those of mira ( @xmath8  cet ) , which may suggest actual similarities in their binary configurations and circumstellar structures . </S>"
