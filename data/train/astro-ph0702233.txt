    "dwarf galaxies include dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies .",
    "their luminosities ( @xmath7 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are much smaller than the characteristic luminosity @xmath8 for giant galaxies .",
    "the faintest dsph galaxies have luminosities comparable to globular clusters , but are more extended ( half - light radius @xmath9 kpc compared to @xmath10 kpc for globular clusters ) and thus have much lower surface brightness .",
    "the formation history of dwarf galaxies is not well - understood .",
    "the standard theory is that dwarf galaxies formed at the centers of subhalos orbiting within the halos of giant galaxies .",
    "however , the standard @xmath11cdm model predicts a much larger number of subhalos than the observed number of dwarf galaxies .",
    "there are @xmath12 known dwarf galaxies in the local group , compared to 300 predicted subhalos with circular velocity @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to determine the velocity dispersion of a dsph galaxy , using three stars in the draco dwarf ( 6.5 ) .",
    "aaronson s result was later confirmed by more extensive observations @xcite .",
    "it is found that all dwarf galaxies have central velocity dispersions @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these dispersions are believed to reflect motions of the stars in the gravitational potential of the galaxy rather than ( say ) atmospheric motions or orbital motion due to a binary companion @xcite .",
    "if the systems are in dynamical equilibrium , the mass derived from these velocity dispersions is much larger than the stellar mass , resulting in a v - band mass - to - light ratio ranging from 7 to 500 @xcite .",
    "therefore , dsph galaxies are probably the darkest objects ever observed in the universe , and thus provide unique probes of the dark - matter distribution on small scales .",
    "two possible alternatives to dark matter in dsph galaxies have been proposed .",
    "the first is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , mond has difficulty reproducing the different mass - to - light ratios of different dsph galaxies , mostly because mond is based on a characteristic acceleration whereas the dsph galaxies seem to have a characteristic velocity dispersion instead .",
    "moreover , mond is difficult to reconcile with the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cmb @xcite .",
    "the second alternative is tidal forces from the host galaxies .",
    "tides have changed the structure and internal kinematics of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to postulate that other dsph galaxies are also undergoing tidal disruption , which leads to the high velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "however , ( i ) sagittarius is much closer to the center of the milky way than other dwarf galaxies ; ( ii ) tides should introduce strong velocity shear and dsph galaxies rotate slowly if at all ; ( iii ) no mechanism of increasing velocity dispersions by tides appears to work for all dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are a few pieces of putative evidence that tides may influence the structure of ursa minor and draco @xcite .",
    "for example , `` extra - tidal extensions '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are found beyond a `` tidal radius '' by fitting a king profile @xcite to stellar number density profiles .",
    "however , the king profile was intended to fit relaxed , constant mass - to - light ratio systems such as globular clusters @xcite , and perhaps the profile can not be applied to dsph galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we model the mass distribution of three dsph galaxies , specifically , draco , ursa minor and fornax .",
    "since we focus on the inner parts ( @xmath15 kpc ) which are very regular @xcite and not significantly affected by tidal stripping @xcite , we assume that the inner part is in dynamical equilibrium with no significant external tidal forces , and test whether this assumption is self - consistent with a given mass distribution .    a wide variety of approaches have been used to model the kinematics of dsph galaxies .",
    "different analysis techniques and assumptions have led to different results .",
    "taking draco as an example ( see also figure [ fig : draco ] ) , if we calibrate the results assuming a v - band luminosity of @xmath16 @xcite , @xcite derive a v - band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath17 within 1.2 kpc using a king model . @xcite and @xcite assume parametric forms for both potential and distribution ( hereafter df ) , and model draco as a near - isothermal sphere ( @xmath18 ) , with @xmath19 within 0.7 kpc , more than a factor of two larger than derived by @xcite at a larger radius . by fitting velocity moments , @xcite investigates the dark matter distribution with parametric dfs and the assumption that dsph galaxies are spherical and derives @xmath20 within 0.4 kpc .",
    "@xcite propose that the mass of draco could range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , assuming an nfw @xcite potential , which has @xmath23 and @xmath24 at @xmath25 and 1.1 kpc , respectively .",
    "@xcite parametrize anisotropy by a constant anisotropy parameter @xmath26 to fit velocity moments and found the mass - to - light ratio was @xmath27 and almost constant with radius for draco . @xcite have determined dark matter distributions , using a sophisticated non - parametric mass distribution , assuming spherical symmetry . however , they assume that the distribution function is isotropic in velocity space , an assumption that can introduce much larger errors than the ones that are controlled by the use of non - parametric mass distribution .",
    "we believe that a better method is to use a non - parametric distribution function and a parametric potential .",
    "the apparent ellipticities and @xmath28 , then the apparent ellipticity @xmath29 .",
    "intrinsic ellipticity @xmath30 is defined similarly , i.e. , it is equal to @xmath31 while the galaxy is seen edge - on . ] of the stellar distributions of dsph galaxies vary from 0.13 ( leo ii ) to 0.56 ( ursa minor ) @xcite .",
    "however , the gravitational potential is dominated by the dark halo in these galaxies , and there is no reason to suppose that the dark halo shape is the same as the shape of the stellar distribution .",
    "hence for simplicity , we assume that the galactic potential is spherical .",
    "in addition , we assume that the distribution of stars in the dsph galaxy is axisymmetric . other methods designed to model axisymmetric galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are more general in that they allow both the potential and the distribution function to be axisymmetric ; however , these are designed to work for a continuous , rather than discrete , observed distribution of stars .",
    "we describe and test our method in  [ sec : method ] and  [ sec : sim ] , respectively .",
    "then we derive the mass density profiles for draco , ursa minor and fornax in  [ sec : res ] .",
    "we discuss the results in  [ sec : dis ] and conclude in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we introduce a cartesian coordinate system , with origin at the center of the dwarf galaxy and @xmath32axis along the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34-axes are the apparent major and minor axes in the plane of the sky , respectively , which can be determined from isodensity contours of the surface number density profile ( isopleths ) .    then the distribution function may be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is energy , @xmath37 is scalar angular momentum , the @xmath38axis is the intrinsic symmetry axis of the stellar distribution and @xmath39 is the angular momentum along the @xmath40-axis .",
    "therefore , the @xmath40-axis lies in the @xmath41 plane . for an observational data set of positions and line - of - sight velocities @xmath42 , we model @xmath35 and determine both the parameters of the potential and the inclination @xmath43 , which is the angle between the @xmath40-axis and the @xmath44-axis .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) have used maximum likelihood analysis to deal with the analogous problem for spherically symmetric dfs in a spherical potential , where the df is a function of two integrals , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this method to the case of an axisymmetric df @xmath35 .",
    "we define a probability function , @xmath45 which gives the probability density to observe a star at @xmath46 with a line - of - sight velocity @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 is also a function of @xmath43 and the assumed gravitational potential @xmath49 .",
    "we maximize the log likelihood function @xmath50 assuming parametrized potentials and non - parametric dfs as follows .    for the potential ,",
    "we assume an analytical form @xmath51 and infer the parameters @xmath52 .",
    "we investigate six possible forms .    1 .   an isochrone model , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total mass .",
    "2 .   the @xcite density - potential pair , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the concentration radius and @xmath57 .",
    "3 .   a power - law density - potential pair @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an arbitrary radius , and then @xmath60 .",
    "4 .   a constant - density model , which is a special case of the power - law model with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "5 .   a constant mass - to - light ratio model ( see  [ sec : ml ] ) .",
    "6 .   a model in which the potential is dominated by a central black hole of mass @xmath63 , @xmath64    for comparison with earlier analysis by other authors",
    ", we shall also fit the data using a more conventional method : fitting to the @xcite three - parameter family of isotropic stellar systems , by minimizing @xmath65 for the surface - density and velocity - dispersion profiles ( see  [ sec : king ] ) .",
    "there is little rotation in dsph galaxies .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt to model the observed rotation : we simply assume @xmath66 is an even function of @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , the non - rotating model has even symmetry around the @xmath33 and @xmath34-axes , i.e. , @xmath67 , so we can assume that @xmath68 are all positive and @xmath69 .",
    "these simplifications increase the computational efficiency significantly .",
    "to construct the df , we divide the @xmath70 space into @xmath71 bins , which are denoted by the triple index @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the bins are mutually exclusive and cover all of the allowed @xmath76 space , as well as some unallowed regions . in our calculation ,",
    "bin @xmath72 is defined by @xmath77 here @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the lower and upper limits of the energy in the bin , and @xmath80 is the maximum angular momentum at energy @xmath36 , corresponding to a circular orbit . to achieve uniform spatial resolution for different potential models , we choose the boundaries of energy bins @xmath81 as the potentials at a set of evenly separated radii .",
    "the limits in @xmath82 are chosen so that the resolution in @xmath83 , the angle between the @xmath38axis and the vector normal to the orbital plane ( the orbital inclination ) is uniform .",
    "note that for spherical systems , the natural choice is uniform in @xmath84 , not @xmath83 .",
    "however , when modeling flattened systems , this choice yields too few bins near @xmath85 .",
    "the factor @xmath86 determines the maximum value for @xmath83 and must be 1 for the bins to cover all allowed regions . however , it can be chosen to be @xmath87 to model a galaxy with very flat ( disk - like ) stellar part with higher computational efficiency .",
    "assuming that the df is constant in bin @xmath72 and zero elsewhere , we can calculate a probability distribution in @xmath88 space ( cf .",
    "paper i ) , @xmath89 we normalize each @xmath90 so that @xmath91 .",
    "assuming the non - negative weights in the bins are @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the log of the likelihood .",
    "notice that @xmath95 has been normalized since all @xmath96 are normalized . for a fixed inclination @xmath43 and fixed potential specified by the parameters @xmath52 ,",
    "we maximize @xmath97 with respect to @xmath98 , then vary @xmath52 and @xmath43 to search for a global maximum @xmath97 . more generally , the posterior probability of @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are prior probabilities .",
    "we use @xmath104 corresponding to an isotropic distribution of orientations .",
    "our rule for choosing @xmath105 is to assign a uniform probability distribution for dimensionless parameters and a uniform probability distribution in log scale for dimensional parameters .",
    "we choose @xmath106 in this paper ; that is , in contrast to paper i we do not use regularization to smooth the df ( in paper i , we found that the errors in derived potential parameters for samples of a few hundred stars were dominated by statistical noise rather than different regularization levels ) .",
    "it is straightforward to account for observational errors in velocities and observational cuts on the sample volume in velocity and position on the sky ( velocity cuts are normally applied to eliminate interlopers ) .",
    "the former is dealt with by convolving @xmath107 with a gaussian error profile .",
    "the latter requires us to normalize @xmath107 within the cuts in velocity and position .",
    "if the surface density of the kinematic sample is proportional to the overall surface density of stars , we use equation ( [ eq : lh ] ) . if not , the distribution of positions contains no information , so in the likelihood function we use the conditional probability @xmath108 in this paper , we use equation ( [ eq : lh ] ) for the calculations in this paper .",
    "an observed surface number density profile may be available for many more stars , over a larger survey area than the kinematic sample . we can easily add this as an additional constraint .",
    "assume the apparent ellipticity of the stellar part is @xmath31 , and that its surface number density profile along the @xmath109axis is @xmath110 with error @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the distance along the @xmath109axis .",
    "we maximize the quantity @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the projected distance from the origin to the ellipse defining the isopleth at an angle @xmath115 relative to the @xmath109axis . in equation",

    "for some systems ( e.g. , draco ) , the available measured surface number density profile is averaged along concentric circles rather than isopleths , we need to simply set @xmath118 in equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "to test the algorithm in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , we construct a dsph galaxy in a power - law potential with @xmath119 where @xmath120 is an anisotropy parameter and @xmath36 is in units of ( ) @xmath121 .",
    "the df is chosen so that the energy distribution is bimodal to challenge our algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1]a shows the spatial distribution of 200 stars in the simulated galaxy with @xmath122 ( tangential anisotropy ) , which has @xmath123 .",
    "we use the algorithm in  [ sec : method ] with @xmath124 and no additional surface density data .",
    "accounting for the prior probability of @xmath43 ( eq . [ eq : ptheta ] ) , @xmath43 is derived to be @xmath125 by fitting a gaussian to the probability distribution in figure [ fig : fig1]b , which is consistent with the input value at the @xmath126 level .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1]c shows the probability distribution of potential parameters , specifically , @xmath127 .",
    "the triangle and plus sign are the input model and the best - fit model , respectively , which agree within the @xmath128 error .",
    "therefore , our algorithm can recover both potential parameters and inclination .",
    "contrastingly , with the assumption that the stellar density is spherical and the df is isotropic , i.e. , @xmath129 , we may get large systematic errors .",
    "we have explored two cases . for the above input model with @xmath122 ( tangential anisotropy )",
    ", the assumption leads to the best - fit model marked by the square with error bars in panel ( d ) of figure [ fig : fig1 ] . for another input model with @xmath130 ( radial anisotropy ) and the same input potential @xmath131 ,",
    "the best - fit model marked by the cross is also inconsistent with the input model .",
    "we conclude that three - integral models that allow for both velocity anisotropy and flattening must be used to avoid possible systematic errors in the derived potential parameters .    for a face - on galaxy ( @xmath132",
    ", we find that the @xmath133 contour for potential parameters extends over at least two orders of magnitude in @xmath134 .",
    "because the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is decoupled from the mass distribution for a face - on disk - like galaxy , an apparently round galaxy may be either a low - density spherical galaxy or a face - on high - density flat galaxy .",
    "therefore , we get a poor constraint on potential parameters of an apparent round dsph galaxy . in practice , we never see disk - like dsph galaxies , so when modeling a galaxy with @xmath118 we will not make a serious error by assuming that the stellar distribution is spherical and using the analogous methods described in paper i for spherical systems of test particles ) , the intrinsic ellipticity @xmath30 is also 1.0 , so we may overestimate the mass by up to @xmath135 if assuming that the stellar distribution is spherical ( @xmath136 ) . ] .",
    "this is not an issue for the three galaxies analyzed in this paper , which are sufficiently flattened that they yield well - constrained results for the potential parameters and inclination .",
    "our algorithm is applied to kinematic data @xmath137 and number density profiles @xmath138 of three dsph galaxies taken from the published literature .",
    "table [ tab : tab1 ] lists several parameters of each galaxy , including the assumed heliocentric distance ( @xmath139 ) , the luminosity in the v - band ( @xmath140 ) , apparent ellipticity ( @xmath31 ) , and the position angle of the major axis derived from the isopleths , as usual measured eastward from north ( @xmath141 ) . in the kinematic sample , we include @xmath142 stars , which have heliocentric velocities in the range @xmath143 and are inside an ellipse with semi - major axis @xmath144 and ellipticity @xmath31 , to exclude possible interlopers which could strongly bias the results ( the same cuts are applied to our likelihood distribution , so this procedure introduces no systematic errors ) .",
    "table 1 also lists the number of stars ( @xmath145 ) and annuli ( @xmath146 ) in the surface number density profile @xmath138 , which has a maximum radius @xmath147 . for the outer parts ( @xmath148 ) , where the number density is very low , we combine a few annuli to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . for draco",
    ", we exclude two bins in which the number density is more than 3@xmath149 away from those in nearby bins .",
    "since king models are spherical , we convert the elliptical surface density distribution to a spherical one , with a surface number density profile @xmath150 so that the number of stars enclosed in a circle with radius @xmath151 and an ellipse with semi - major axis @xmath114 are equal .",
    "a king model is defined by three parameters , which may be chosen as the characteristic velocity dispersion of the df @xmath149 , the difference between the potential at the tidal radius and that at the center @xmath152 in units of @xmath153 , and a core radius @xmath154 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "since the df is parametric , we do not use the method in  [ sec : method ] , but fit velocity dispersion profiles and number density profiles , as shown in figure [ fig : king ] .",
    "we have binned the kinematic data into @xmath155 bins with approximately the same number of stars in each bin . considering the likelihood and assigning a flat prior probability for @xmath156",
    ", we estimate the parameters and their errors , which are given in table [ tab : king ] .",
    "we fit the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles while @xcite , having a smaller kinematic data set , only fit the core radial velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover , @xcite estimate an average velocity dispersion @xmath157 from 46 stars for ursa minor , which is much lower than @xmath158 from 163 stars used in our calculation . nonetheless , considering the factor of 2.0 in the velocity dispersion for ursa minor , the derive mass - to - light ratios ( see table [ tab : king ] ) similar to the values of @xcite , @xmath159 for draco , @xmath160 for ursa minor and @xmath161 for fornax .",
    "figure [ fig : king ] shows that a single - component king model does not fit the data of draco and fornax , but is formally consistent with those of ursa minor .",
    "however , the last point of the ursa minor kinematic data suggests that a king model may be ruled out if future observations show that the flat dispersion profile extends to larger radii . in all three systems ,",
    "the observational data have an excess in both velocity dispersion and surface number density at large radii , and the dispersion profile is flat rather than decreasing as in the king models .",
    "we fit the parametrized models for the mass distribution in  [ sec : method ] to the data .",
    "we must assume a maximum radius @xmath162 , so that the upper energy limit of the bins in equation ( [ eq : ebin ] ) is @xmath163 .",
    "we set @xmath162 as 2 kpc for draco and ursa minor , 6 kpc for fornax , which are reasonable because the surface number density is negligible at these radii .",
    "for the power - law model , we set @xmath59 as 0.28 kpc for draco , 0.6 kpc for ursa minor and 1.1 kpc for fornax to minimize the covariance of @xmath134 and @xmath164 in their bivariate probability distribution .",
    "the models labeled  constant mass - to - light ratio \" require some explanation . since our method assumes that the potential is spherical in this paper , we do not attempt to construct a full model of a non - spherical galaxy with constant mass - to - light ratio . to derive the potential of the constant mass - to - light - ratio model , we assume that all stars have the same mass - to - light ratio and construct a spherical density distribution as in equation ( [ eq : r ] )",
    ". so the luminosity profile @xmath165 is proportional to the volume number density of stars .",
    "the spherical assumption is then used to derive the potential , but dropped when modeling the galaxy itself , i.e. , we assume a non - spherical galaxy in a spherical potential .",
    "it is convenient to fit luminosity profile @xmath166 with a linear combination of two exponential functions @xmath167 where @xmath168 are constant parameters listed in table [ tab : exp ] so that @xmath169 the chi - square of the fitting shows that the luminosity profiles are indeed well approximated by equation ( [ eq : fitrou ] ) .",

    "therefore , we do not try to fit @xmath43 accurately , but give a rough estimate @xmath186 .",
    "several features of table 4 are worth noting : ( i ) for the nfw and isochrone models , there is a strong correlation between the two parameters in @xmath52 , which explains why the fractional error in @xmath187 is smaller than the fractional error in the potential parameters .",

    "@xmath192 , we calculate the predicted velocity dispersion @xmath193 from the velocity distribution profile @xmath194 comparison of the first two rows of panels in figures [ fig : king ] and [ fig : fit ] shows that the present models provide a substantially better fit to the observed velocity - dispersion and surface - density profiles in all three galaxies than the best - fitting king models . this visual impression",
    "is confirmed in table 6 , which gives goodness - of - fit statistics for the velocity - dispersion profile ( @xmath195 ) and surface - density profile ( @xmath65 ) and their deviations from the expected values @xmath196 and @xmath146 ( the number of bins ) , in units of the standard deviation @xmath197 or @xmath198 ( @xmath128 error ) .",
    "the deviations for the present models are @xmath199 for all three galaxies , while the king models are much poorer fits for draco and fornax .",
    "( iv ) note that the models are fitted to the surface - density distribution as a function of radius , assuming the observed ellipticity @xmath31 ( eqs .",
    "14 - 17 ) .",
    "thus it is not guaranteed that the the ellipticity of the isopleths in the models will be similar to the observed ellipticity ( no doubt a better approach would have been to fit the two - dimensional surface - density distribution , but this is substantially more computationally expensive ) .",
    "nevertheless the ellipticities of the models , quoted in table 6 at the core radius , are similar to the observed ellipticities .",
    "the third row in figure [ fig : fit ] shows the derived mass profiles of various models for the three dsph galaxies .",
    "all of the models shown are within @xmath200 of the best - fit models .",

    ", our algorithm gives relatively small errors at intermediate radii , and the surface number density profile only weakly constrains the mass density profile beyond @xmath179 .    the bottom row in figure [ fig : fit ] shows the average mass - to - light ratio @xmath202 for the best - fit models . the light inside a radius @xmath203 is calculated from equation ( [ eq : fitrou ] ) . comparing table [ tab : king ] and [ tab : iso ] , we can see that king model gives estimates of mass at the outer limit of the kinematic data , @xmath179 , consistent with those from more general models within @xmath133 .",
    "however , king model assumes a constant mass - to - light ratio , which is an average value . for the more general models , except at small radii where the mass density is very uncertain , the mass - to - light ratios increase with radius .",
    "therefore , the global mass - to - light ratios are probably even greater than @xmath204 .",
    "we have shown that two integral ( @xmath172 ) models can reproduce all of the observed features of dsph galaxies .",
    "we also list the results for three - integral models , @xmath206 , in tables [ tab : aniso ] and [ tab : stat ] .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios are generally larger than the values for @xmath172 models by @xmath207 to @xmath135 .",
    "this result suggests that given the freedom to adjust the df in @xmath37 direction , high mass models are better able to fit the observed data than low mass models , thus the derived mass distributions are more skewed to the high end . in the following sections , we adopt the conservative ( lower ) estimates of mass - to - light ratios that are derived with the case of @xmath172 .",
    "we believe that the mass estimates presented here are the most accurate and reliable that have so far been obtained for the three dsph galaxies , draco , ursa minor and fornax . in our models , we assume that the stellar distributions are not significantly affected by the tidal force of the milky way . this assumption is confirmed by a dynamical argument : using the mass @xmath187 of the best - fit models in table [ tab : iso ] , which is a lower limit to the total mass , the roche limit is 2.6 kpc ( 3.5@xmath144 ) for draco , 2.6 kpc ( 2.4@xmath144 ) for ursa minor and 6.6 kpc ( 2.4@xmath144 ) for fornax , assuming that that the milky way is an isothermal sphere with @xmath208 .",
    "the roche limits also exceed @xmath162 , the maximum radius used in our dynamic models in  [ sec : ml ] .",
    "therefore , our assumption that the dsph galaxies are isolated systems in virial equilibrium is self - consistent . because our models can fit both radial velocity profiles and surface number density profiles , the so - called `` extra - tidal extensions '' in the surface number density profiles found by @xcite and @xcite do not require any special ad hoc explanation .",
    "thus it is not valid to consider them as the evidence of tidal stripping , as proposed by some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we strongly rule out any centrally condensed mass distribution like a dominant central black hole , as well as constant - density and ( for draco and fornax ) constant mass - to - light ratio models .",
    "for example , the constant - density model is ruled out at the level of 4.1@xmath149 for draco , 3.4@xmath149 for ursa minor and 4.4@xmath149 for fornax .",
    "in contrast to the positive result of @xcite based on the same data set , the constant mass - to - light ratio is ruled out at 8.6@xmath149 level for draco .",
    "we derive an average mass - to - light ratio of @xmath1 within @xmath2 kpc for draco , @xmath3 within @xmath4 kpc for ursa minor and @xmath5 within @xmath6 kpc for fornax .",
    "note that these values are probably lower limits for the global mass - to - light ratio because the mass - to - light ratio increases with @xmath203 for the best - fit models .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios we obtain for all three galaxies are larger than the estimates of global mass - to - light ratio by @xcite ( @xmath209 for draco , @xmath160 for ursa minor and @xmath161 for fornax ) .",
    "the discrepancies arise because the results of @xcite and @xcite are based on a single - component king model and because we have a larger sample of radial velocities , covering a larger range of radii .",
    "figure [ fig : draco ] shows the derived mass - to - light ratio of draco as a function of radius and the estimates by other authors .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio for draco is assumed constant in some of these studies @xcite but is allowed to vary with radius in others @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the large mass - to - light ratios of dsph s may be partly due to velocity anisotropy , since anisotropy can inflate the derived by a factor of three or so if the kinematic information is restricted to the central parts of the galaxy .",
    "the simulations of  [ sec : sim ] confirm that velocity anisotropy and flattening of the stellar distribution ( i.e. , the dependence of the df on @xmath37 and @xmath39 ) must be accounted for to obtain accurate mass - to - light ratios .",
    "nonetheless , for the three dsph galaxies , the df @xmath210 fits the data reasonably well (  [ sec : result ] ) , and the derived masses actually increase if we allow the dependence of df on @xmath37 (  [ sec : ml ] ) .",
    "so we find no evidence that three - integral models fit the current data significantly better than two - integral models , or that they prefer models with lower mass - to - light ratio .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that the velocity dispersion profiles of draco and ursa minor seem to show a sharp drop at radii of 0.81 and 0.84 kpc , respectively .",
    "the drop in the dispersion profile seems to coincide with a `` break '' in the number density profile , and wilkinson et al .",
    "propose that this is evidence of a kinematically cold population .",
    "however , the sharp drop may only be present in particular binning schemes @xcite and is not seen with our binning scheme ( figure [ fig : king ] ) .",
    "our models do not reproduce such a sharp drop .",
    "thus , the drop is inconsistent with stationary axisymmetric models of the df and also is not statistically significant given the present data .",
    "the large masses that we have derived may help alleviate but may not eliminate the problem that there are far fewer dwarf galaxies in the local group than predicted by standard cosmological models .",
    "we model dsph galaxies as axisymmetric stellar systems in spherical potentials , which are in dynamical equilibrium without significant external tidal forces .",
    "for the three dsph galaxies , draco , ursa minor and fornax , plausible parametric models of the potential combined with non - parametric two - integral models of the stellar distribution function can naturally reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profiles and number density profiles .",
    "the masses of these models are high enough so that tidal forces from the milky way do not significantly affect the observed kinematics .",
    "so the models are self - consistent and `` extra - tidal extensions '' simply reflect an extended axisymmetric envelope that is still in virial equilibrium . the sharp drop in velocity dispersion which coincides with a `` break '' in the light distribution that has been claimed in the literature",
    "is not observed in our binning scheme and can not be reproduced in the scenario of virial equilibrium .",
    "the isochrone , nfw and power - law models all fit the data .",
    "we strongly rule out any centrally condensed mass distribution like a dominant central black hole , as well as constant - density and ( for draco and fornax ) constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the average v - band mass - to - light ratio in our best - fit two - integral models is @xmath1 within @xmath2 kpc for draco , @xmath3 within @xmath4 kpc for ursa minor and @xmath5 within @xmath6 kpc for fornax .",
    "our method considers both anisotropy of the df and the non - spherical geometry of the stellar population , and investigates a large variety of mass distribution models , and thus should yield more reliable mass distributions than previous investigations .",
    "our simulations show that anisotropy ( dependence on @xmath37 ) and flattening ( dependence on @xmath39 ) in the df may substantially affect derived masses of axisymmetric galaxies .",
    "however , we detect no strong evidence of anisotropy in the three dsph galaxies , i.e. , a two - integral df @xmath211 is consistent with the data .",
    "allowing anisotropy yields even larger mass - to - light ratios .",
    "our method could be improved by fitting the two - dimensional surface number - density distribution rather than a one - dimensional profile .",
    "observationally , it would be useful to extend the kinematic surveys to larger radii , since the current limits are still well within the radii where tidal forces are likely to complicate the analysis .",

    "i wish to thank mark wilkinson for providing the kinematic data of draco and ursa minor and surface number density profile of draco in tabular form .",
