    "with the advent of precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies , and distant type ia supernovae ( snia ) , a new paradigm of cosmology has been established . in this new standard model , the geometry is flat so that @xmath1 , and the total energy density is made up of matter ( @xmath2 ) [ comprising of baryons ( @xmath3 ) and cold dark matter ( @xmath4 ) ] , and dark energy ( @xmath5 , with equation of state @xmath6 ) . with only a few free parameters this model provides an excellent fit to all current observations  @xcite . in turn",
    ", this allows for constraints on other , nonstandard cosmological parameters .",
    "two very interesting possibilities discussed widely in the literature are : ( i ) a subdominant contribution to the total energy density in the form of neutrino hot dark matter ( hdm ) and hence limits on the neutrino mass @xmath7 , and ( ii ) an equation of state for the dark energy component that deviates from @xmath8 and/or is time - dependent .    in the first case ,",
    "data from atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation experiments strongly suggest two important mass differences in the neutrino mass hierarchy , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this data set implies @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , i.e. , the so - called normal hierarchy .",
    "alternatively , since the sign of @xmath14 can not be fixed by atmospheric neutrino oscillations , an inverted hierarchy with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is also allowed .",
    "yet a third possibility is that the three mass eigenstates are nearly degenerate , with @xmath18 .",
    "if the last case prevails , then oscillation experiments can offer no useful information on the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "cosmology provides an interesting measure of the neutrino mass through the neutrino s kinematic effects on large scale structure formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , free streaming of a hdm particle causes essentially all of its own perturbations to be erased on scales below its free streaming length @xmath19 .",
    "this erasure is simultaneously propagated to other species ( eg . , cdm ) via the metric source term . the net effect on the present day",
    "large scale matter power spectrum @xmath20 is a suppression of order @xmath21 ( assuming @xmath22 , and normalisation at @xmath23 ) at large wavenumbers @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . indeed , within the @xmath26cdm framework , lss observations to date have already been able to constrain the sum of the neutrino mass to @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) @xcite , depending on the data set used .",
    "this limit should be compared with the current laboratory bound from tritium @xmath29 decay experiments , @xmath30 ( @xmath28 ) @xcite , and the projected sensitivity of the upcoming katrin experiment , @xmath31 @xcite .    in the second case ,",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is a cosmological constant  @xmath26 , obeying @xmath8 .",
    "a minimal extension of this is to assume that the dark energy equation of state is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is constant in time . using this framework ,",
    "various cosmological data sets have been analysed in many independent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with the most recent data @xmath33",
    "is constrained to be extremely close to @xmath34 , the value for a pure cosmological constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in many particle physics models of dark energy , the equation of state is expected to depend on the scale factor , and many authors have analysed the data in terms of dark energy models with varying equations of state ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from an observational point of view , the simplest possibility is that @xmath33 undergoes a transition between two asymptotic values .",
    "this is very often also the case in particle physics models of dark energy such as quintessence @xcite .",
    "the same is also true in models where dark energy is a consequence of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "cosmological data to date show no evidence for time variations in the dark energy equation of state .",
    "however , for future high precision observations , it is natural to search for such time dependences .",
    "later on when we analyse the ability of future cosmological probes to constrain neutrino masses and the dark energy equation of state , we will also include this possibility using a simple parameterisation .",
    "recently , it was shown that presently available data admit an apparent degeneracy between @xmath35 and @xmath33 @xcite . specifically , by extending @xmath33 ( taken to be constant in time ) into the phantom regime ( @xmath36 ) , the neutrino mass bound relaxes to @xmath37 from a combined cmb+lss+snia analysis , compared to @xmath38 for the case of a fixed @xmath39 using the same data set .",
    "this @xmath40 degeneracy can be explained as follows .",
    "the suppression of power at small scales due to a large @xmath7 can be accommodated by lss data if @xmath41 is simultaneously increased to `` restore '' the matter power spectrum to its canonical spectral shape . on the other hand , @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath42 ( and hence @xmath43 in a flat universe ) are degenerate parameters in the hubble expansion rate at redshifts probed by snia , such that an increased @xmath41 can be compensated for by a decreased  @xmath33 .",
    "these two degeneracies then combine to produce an apparent interplay between @xmath7  and  @xmath33 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the @xmath44 degeneracy can be effectively broken by adding to the likelihood analysis new data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak @xcite , bringing the present bound on the sum of neutrino masses to the @xmath45 ev range . in this work , however , we consider the prospects for breaking this degeneracy with an alternative approach , namely , weak gravitational lensing .    weak gravitational lensing ( or cosmic shear ) of distant galaxies by the intervening large scale structure provides an unbiased way to map the matter distribution in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "perturbations in the density field between the source and the observer induce distortions in the images of source galaxies . by measuring the angular correlation of these distortions",
    ", one can in principle reconstruct the underlying three - dimensional matter power spectrum , without making assumptions about the luminous versus dark matter bias ( cf .",
    "conventional galaxy surveys ) . since its first detection in 2000 @xcite ,",
    "the sensitivity of weak lensing surveys has improved to the stage where they are able to provide constraints on the matter density @xmath41 and the fluctuation amplitude @xmath46 that are competitive with other cosmological probes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several larger surveys are now in operation or in planning .",
    "these include the canada  france ",
    "hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) @xcite , the dark energy survey ( des ) @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite , and vista @xcite , culminating in the most ambitious supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) @xcite and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite surveys .",
    "furthermore , all future weak lensing surveys will provide photometric redshift information on the source galaxies .",
    "this additional information allows one to study tomographically the growth of the intervening large scale structure and the distance ",
    "redshift relation @xcite .",
    "indeed , weak lensing tomography is expected to reach a level of sensitivity comparable ( and orthogonal ) to snia for dark energy parameter determination ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we outline the principle of weak lensing tomography and present the formalism for computing the convergence power spectrum in section [ sec : tomography ] . in section [ sec : systematics ] , we discuss some of the systematic effects relevant for tomographic studies . the fisher matrix formalism and the projected errors for various cosmological parameters",
    "are presented in section [ sec : forecast ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "distortions in the images of galaxies induced by density perturbations between the source and the observer can be described by the distortion tensor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the angular position of a light ray in the source and the image planes respectively , and the tensor @xmath50 decomposes into a convergence ( i.e. , magnification , @xmath51 ) and two shear ( i.e. , stretching , @xmath52 ) components . in the born approximation ,",
    "the convergence component is given by a weighted projection of the density fluctuations @xmath53 along the line of sight , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the comoving radial distance , @xmath56 the hubble parameter , and @xmath57 denotes the distance to the horizon .",
    "the assumption of a flat universe is implicit .",
    "the lensing weighting function is defined as @xmath58 with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of source galaxies between redshift @xmath62 and @xmath63 per steradian , and satisfies the normalisation condition @xmath64 .",
    "it is generally assumed that @xmath61 takes the form @xmath65\\ , , \\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath29 and @xmath67 are chosen to fit the observed galaxy redshift distribution . here ,",
    "we fix @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the choice of the parameter @xmath67 depends on the type of weak lensing survey : for a ground - based `` wide '' survey , @xmath70 corresponds to a median galaxy redshift @xmath71 ; for a space - based `` deep '' survey , the choice of @xmath72 gives @xmath73 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "where photometric redshift information on the source galaxies is available and the sources separable into tomography bins , equations ( [ eq : convergence ] ) and ( [ eq : weightingfunction ] ) can be generalised to give the convergence of the @xmath74th bin via @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number density of source galaxies in the @xmath74th tomography bin , and @xmath77 by construction .",
    "a simple model for @xmath78 would be @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the lower and upper limits of the @xmath74th tomography bin .",
    "since lensing by large scale density perturbations leads to image distortions typically of order @xmath82 or less ( much smaller than the intrinsic scatter in galaxy shapes ) , cosmological weak lensing must be measured statistically with a large ensemble of sources and lenses . by decomposing the convergence field into two - dimensional fourier modes ,",
    "@xmath83 one can define the angular power spectrum of the convergence at multipole @xmath84 between the @xmath74th and @xmath85th tomographic bin as @xmath86 in the limber approximation ( where only modes with longitudinal wavenumbers @xmath87 contribute to the correlation ) , the convergence power spectrum is related to the three - dimensional matter power spectrum @xmath20 via @xcite @xmath88 assuming a flat universe .",
    "thus weak lensing tomography with @xmath89 bins yields @xmath89 auto ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 cross ( @xmath92 ) correlation spectra .",
    "the case of @xmath93 corresponds to lensing without tomography , and we shall be using these two terms interchangeably throughout the text .",
    "figure  [ fig : cl ] shows an example of the convergence auto and cross power spectra expected for tomography with two bins .",
    "it is important to note that these power spectra are strongly correlated , and in their entirety do not provide as much information as a nave interpretation might suggest .",
    "the gain in information from tomographic binning can be quantified by the correlation coefficient between the power spectra of the individual tomography bins , @xmath94  @xcite . a strong correlation ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) between two bins means that further subdivision is futile .",
    "note that while we have discussed only the convergence , existing and future weak lensing surveys will measure the source galaxies ellipticities and hence the two shear components .",
    "however , by decomposing the shear signal into a gradient ( `` @xmath96-mode '' ) and a curl ( `` @xmath97-mode '' ) component , it can be shown that the statistics of the @xmath96-mode shear and of the convergence are identical ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath97-mode is expected to yield a vanishing spectrum and therefore serves as a powerful test for residual systematics @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we shall consider the convergence power spectrum as representative of the lensing signatures .      the weak lensing signal ( [ eq : wlpower ] ) comprises of two distinct components : the lensing weights @xmath98 and the matter power spectrum @xmath20 . while the latter quantifies the universal matter distribution ,",
    "the role of the former , in broad terms , is to project this three - dimensional distribution onto the two - dimensional sky for the observer . in general , for a single source at comoving distance @xmath99 , the function @xmath98 peaks at roughly @xmath100 .",
    "thus , within the @xmath26cdm framework , a typical source distribution such as ( [ eq : ngal ] ) peaking at @xmath101 will be most efficiently lensed by structures at @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : weights ] ) .",
    "the effects of dark energy are manifest in both the lensing weights and the matter power spectrum . in the case of @xmath98 , the dark energy density @xmath42 and equation of state",
    "@xmath103 determine the hubble expansion rate at low redshifts , @xmath104 } \\right],\\ ] ] and hence the distance ",
    "redshift relation , @xmath105 , responsible for the projection ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : weights ] ) . in the above equation",
    "we have assumed spatial flatness .",
    "this assumption will be kept throughout the analysis .",
    "on the other hand , dark energy suppresses the growth of structure relative to the case of a flat , matter - dominated universe . in the absence of massive neutrinos",
    ", the linear matter power spectrum evolves as @xmath106 , independently of @xmath107 . here , @xmath108 is the growth function normalised to @xmath109 , and can be obtained by solving the differential equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath110 \\frac{d g}{d \\ln a } + 3 [ 1-w(a ) ] \\omega_{\\rm de}(a ) g(a)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is the dark energy density at epoch @xmath113 .",
    "the effects of @xmath42 and @xmath33 on the growth function are generally mild compared to those on @xmath98 . for the case of @xmath114 , for example , the lensing weight @xmath98 increases by a uniform @xmath115 relative to the @xmath8 case across @xmath116 , while the change in the growth function @xmath108 is a minute @xmath117 at @xmath118 at the peak of the lensing efficiency and only reaches @xmath119 at @xmath120 at the tail of @xmath98 .",
    "thus the dominant constraints on the dark energy parameters will come from projection .",
    "in addition , @xmath42 ( @xmath121 ) impacts immediately on the epoch of matter  radiation equality , which in turn determines the location of the turning point in the matter power spectrum .",
    "neutrino masses in the sub - ev range do not play a role in the universal expansion rate at low redshifts .",
    "their early free - streaming effect on the shape of the matter power spectrum is however well known .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the loss of power at large wavenumbers due to a large @xmath7 can be offset by simultaneously translating the matter power spectrum towards large values of @xmath107 .",
    "this translation can be accomplished by increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and hence moving the matter  radiation equality epoch forward to an earlier time when the causal horizon is smaller . in this way , @xmath7 and @xmath42 form a degenerate pair .",
    "lensing without tomography , like angular galaxy surveys , makes use of a projected signal accumulated over a large distance ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the information content of this signal , especially in the radial @xmath123 direction , is therefore limited .",
    "tomography binning allows one to recover some radial information through a set of lensing weights @xmath124 that peak at different values of @xmath123 .",
    "this is particularly useful for establishing the distance  redshift relation and hence breaking the @xmath125 degeneracy .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : weights ] , two sets of @xmath126 with lensing weights that are indistinguishable to the naked eye in the case of no tomography begin to show perceivable signs of differences when three tomography bins are used .",
    "tomography will not improve directly the neutrino mass bound . even though massive neutrinos continue to affect the growth of small scale density fluctuations at low redshifts , the shape of the matter power spectrum evolves by a negligible amount over the @xmath62 range probed by weak lensing .",
    "to illustrate this point , we note that for @xmath127 , the normalised power spectrum @xmath128 changes by less than @xmath129 at large values of @xmath107 between @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "this is smaller than the overall power suppression expected even for a @xmath132 neutrino today ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "nonetheless , once the @xmath125 degeneracy is lifted by projection effects , the @xmath134 shape degeneracy will be correspondingly reduced and the bound on @xmath135 tightened .",
    "a number of systematic effects have been identified that could severely limit the potential of weak lensing surveys for cosmological parameter extraction .",
    "we discuss some of these below . for other systematics",
    "not covered here , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "future surveys will observe a projected billion galaxies , a sample too large for individual spectroscopic redshift measurements . by observing the galaxy broad band features ( i.e. , broad band photometry ) and comparing them to predictions from galaxy spectral energy distributions ,",
    "redshift information can be obtained much more quickly at the cost of lower accuracy .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the photometrically measured redshift are typically @xmath136 ( hubble deep field  @xcite , cfhtls @xcite , snap with ir - filters  @xcite , combo-17 survey  @xcite with multi - colour filters etc . ) , compared with @xmath137 using spectroscopic methods ( deep2 @xcite , vvds @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "assigning redshifts to galaxies using photometric methods should not contribute significantly to the error budget in weak lensing ( without tomography ) measurements .",
    "for tomographic studies , however , binning with photometric redshifts @xmath138 that suffer from uncontrolled scatter and bias relative to the true ( spectroscopic ) redshifts @xmath62 can lead to considerable error degradation in the dark energy parameter extraction .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that the scatter and the bias per redshift interval @xmath139 need to be known to an accuracy of @xmath140 , in order not to degrade the errors in @xmath42 and @xmath33 by more than a factor of  @xmath141 .",
    "we account for uncertainties in the photometric redshift following the approach of @xcite .",
    "the true number of galaxy per steradian at redshift @xmath142 $ ] in the @xmath74th tomography bin is defined as @xmath143 where the function @xmath144 is the probability that a given @xmath62 will be measured as @xmath138 .",
    "this formulation assumes that @xmath61 will be accurately determined by an independent , dedicated spectroscopic survey ( an alternative formulation for the case of a photometrically derived @xmath61 can be found in @xcite ) . for simplicity , we choose @xmath144 to be a gaussian , @xmath145\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the scatter and the bias parameters respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we discretise @xmath146 and @xmath147 into @xmath148 sets of parameters @xmath149 , where @xmath150 and @xmath151 , on an equally spaced grid from @xmath130 to @xmath152 . later on , each of @xmath153 and @xmath154 will be treated as a free parameter in our error forecast analysis .",
    "the exact forms of @xmath146 and @xmath147 depend on how the photometric redshift is measured by the lensing survey .",
    "for example , @xmath155 can be reduced by going to space ( to eliminate the problem of absorption in the earth s atmosphere ) , or by implementing ir - filters ( sensitive to galaxies at @xmath156 ) .",
    "another possibility is to calibrate the survey internally by doing spectroscopy on a fraction of the source galaxies  @xcite .    in this study , we choose as our fiducial model @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and for these values , we have verified that the accuracy requirements for the scatter and the bias are roughly consistent with those found in @xcite .",
    "technically , shear measurement is performed not on the actual galaxy images , but on images convolved with a point spread function ( psf ) which describes the various image distortions originating from the telescope , the camera , and , in the case of ground - based surveys , the atmosphere .",
    "errors in the lensing signal can therefore arise from uncorrected spatial and temporal variations in the psf , as well as from the deconvolution and shear estimation method itself .",
    "shear measurement errors can generally be discussed under the umbrellas of multiplicative and additive errors .",
    "a number of algorithms have been developed so far to estimate the shear in an observed image , all of which must be calibrated against simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "uncertainties in the calibration can lead to the measured shear being over- or under - estimated by a constant multiplicative factor , and hence impact directly on the @xmath41 and @xmath46 parameter determination .",
    "shear calibration errors are estimated to be @xmath159 currently , and are expected to be controlled to @xmath160 by the time snap and/or lsst start  @xcite .    to incorporate this effect into our analysis",
    ", we follow the approach of @xcite , and define the theoretical convergence power spectrum as @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the irreducible part of the shear calibration error in the @xmath74th tomography bin , after averaging over all directions and redshifts within the bin . thus ,",
    "for tomography with @xmath89 bins , there are @xmath89 shear bias parameters .",
    "additive errors arise when artificial shear signals are induced by , e.g. , anisotropies in the psf . in general , the psf varies both spatially and temporally , and the anisotropies incurred by these variations must be calibrated , usually using stars in the observed fields , for each individual image .",
    "current simulations suggest that additive psf errors can be controlled to under @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "the effects of additive errors are more difficult to parameterise , since the errors will generally depend on @xmath84 .",
    "a first attempt in @xcite defines the total convergence power spectrum as @xmath164 , where the additive error spectrum @xmath165 is assumed to be a power law in @xmath84 . within this framework",
    ", the authors of @xcite conclude that additive errors must be controlled to @xmath166 .",
    "we shall not be considering additive errors in this work , but simply note here that the size of current simulations are too small to determine if the @xmath167 accuracy requirement is realistic @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of weak lensing surveys peaks at scales of several arcminutes , i.e. , @xmath168 @xcite ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : cl ] ) . at these scales",
    "the shear statistics is dominated by density perturbations of comoving wavenumbers @xmath169 at @xmath102 .",
    "thus , weak lensing probes a convolution of linear and nonlinear scales at present and earlier times , and the linear power spectra @xmath170 computed by , e.g. , cmbfast @xcite alone will not suffice to determine total matter power spectrum @xmath20 .",
    "assuming that baryons trace cdm exactly , accurate predictions of @xmath20 can be obtained by means of collisionless @xmath171-body simulations . at present various cosmological simulation codes agree at the @xmath172 level @xcite for @xmath26cdm cosmologies . in the future",
    ", however , @xmath20 will have to be calibrated to about @xmath173 accuracy in order not to compromise the cosmological parameter extraction from ambitious surveys such as snap and lsst @xcite .",
    "inclusion of baryon physics introduces an extra layer of complexity ; dissipative processes such as radiative cooling and star formation enters at @xmath174 , and require in addition the use of hydrodynamical simulations to accurately model the behaviour of the baryon gas .",
    "we note in passing that large volume simulations of dark energy cosmologies to date have focussed mainly on @xmath26cdm , although there have been some efforts in the direction of @xmath175 and/or a time - varying equation of state ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to our knowledge , simulations of dark energy cosmologies with mixed dark matter",
    "have not yet been reported in the literature .",
    "a number of semi - analytical methods and fitting formulae have been devised  @xcite , some of which tested to roughly @xmath176 accuracy against @xmath171-body simulations @xcite , to map between the linear and nonlinear power spectra in cdm cosmologies .",
    "virtually all weak lensing parameter constraint analyses to date employ one of these mapping methods . in this paper , we correct for nonlinearity using the halo model @xcite , assuming that it can be generalised to general dark energy and mixed dark matter cosmologies . here , the total matter power spectrum is taken to be a weighted average of the neutrino ( @xmath177 ) , and the combined baryon ( @xmath178 ) and cdm ( @xmath179 ) power spectra , @xmath180^{2},\\ ] ] with weights @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 . the nonlinear baryon and cdm power spectrum @xmath184 is mapped from its linear counterpart , @xmath185^{2},\\ ] ] following the halo model prescription .",
    "see [ sec : halomodel ] for details .",
    "figure [ fig : nl ] shows the nonlinear matter power spectra constructed in this fashion for various neutrino masses .",
    "clearly , the suppression of power due to neutrino free - streaming extends well into the nonlinear regime ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "indeed , the halo model predicts an even stronger suppression on nonlinear scales than in the linear region ( @xmath187 ) . however , compared with their corresponding uncorrected power spectra ( i.e. , power spectra calculated from the linear theory , extended into the nonlinear regime ) , this relative suppression , i.e. , the ratio @xmath188 , in the corrected spectra seems to be somewhat weaker .",

    "this result remains to be verified by simulations .",
    "we do not consider nonlinearity in the neutrino power spectrum @xmath189 incurred from late - time infall into existing halos @xcite , since it affects the total matter power spectrum and hence the weak lensing observables only at the @xmath190 level @xcite .",
    "we ignore also corrections due to cooling baryons and the intra - cluster gas @xcite , although results from recent @xmath171-body / hydrodynamical simulations suggest that baryon physics affects the weak lensing signal at the @xmath191 and the @xmath192 levels at @xmath193 and @xmath194 respectively @xcite .",
    "we use the fisher matrix formalism to estimate the constraints on various cosmological parameters from weak lensing tomography .",

    "the addition of tomography binning pushes the error down even further .",
    "of course , these impressive sensitivities come at a price : appropriate priors have been imposed on the systematics parameters in order not to degrade the sensitivity to any one ( cosmological ) parameter by more than @xmath284 relative to the best achievable error by a systematics - free lensing survey .",
    "figure [ fig : degradation ] shows the degradation in the projected sensitivities to @xmath279 as a function of priors on the shear calibration bias and photometric redshift errors for two combinations of planck and lensing tomography with five bins .",

    "for example , the sensitivity degrades rapidly as the accuracy requirement for @xmath149 is relaxed .",
    "in contrast , the degradation due to shear calibration errors saturates at @xmath285 for @xmath42 ( planck+wide-5 ) , and much less for other parameters .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the findings of @xcite , where the shear calibration errors are said to enter a `` self - calibration '' regime .",
