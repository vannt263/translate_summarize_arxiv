    "modern fabrication techniques allow electronic devices to be designed and constructed at the molecular level . consequently , it is instructive to investigate possible structures theoretically , with a view to their varying physical properties , as a guide to designing devices with the desired characteristics . of interest here",
    "are the electronic transmission aspects of the atomic wire , and how they can be modified by the attachment of one or more atoms ( or groups of atoms ) at various points on the wire .",
    "an early study , along these lines , was that of guinea and vergs @xcite , who investigated the electronic properties of a chain with linear side branches and loops .",
    "the work concentrated on the local densities of states , but also considered the implications for transmission .",
    "a key finding was that the irregularities in geometric structure lead to the blocking of transmission , at certain energies .",
    "a later treatment , focusing on transmisison through a chain , was performed by singha deo and basu @xcite.they showed that an interplay between substitutional impurities and topological defects ( such as a side branch ) can make the band asymmetric , with resulting effects on the transmission .",
    "the effect can arise with as little as a single impurity present in an otherwise periodic chain .",
    "more recently , kalyanaraman and evans @xcite also considered electron transfer along an atomic wire with a side branch , and with particular attention paid to dendritic structures .",
    "the main result was that such structures can exhibit larger conductance than linear chains , with the position and topology of the side branches being crucial in determining the transport properties .",
    "et al _ @xcite utilised the renormalization method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to study electron transmission through a ladder ( two coupled chains ) with a side - attached impurity , observing that the effects are quite different than for a substitutional impurity .",
    "the present authors @xcite used a tensorial green - function method to study overlap effects on electron transmission through the simplest type of branched atomic wire , namely , a t - junction consisting of a chain of atoms with just a single additional atom attached to its side .",
    "it was observed that overlap can either enhance or suppress transmission , and does so in a different way than does the presence of an impurity or a branch in the chain .",
    "the present paper extends the previous work @xcite to consider more elaborate attachments , specifically , longer branches with sub - branches and multiple branches at a single site , and branches at two sites along the atomic wire .",
    "the method used is the tensorial green - function technique of earlier work @xcite , which allows for the inclusion of overlap both in the atomic wire and any attached structures .",
    "the renormalization method @xcite provides an efficient way to treat a complicated attachment , by rescaling it to an energy - dependent substitutional impurity at the chain site to which the structure is attached . as we are considering such attachments at either one or two sites , such systems can thus be reduced to atomic wires with one or two impurities .",
    "as previously mentioned , the former has been considered by us @xcite , while the latter has only been treated in the zero - overlap case @xcite .",
    "thus , the methodology , discussed in the next sections , firstly extends the theory of electron transmission through double - impurity wires , so as to incorporate overlap , which is similar to the single - impurity theory , then , secondly , uses the renormalization technique to reduce complicated branched structures to single atomic wires containing one or two impurities .",
    "in this section , we look briefly at the theory of electron transmission through an atomic wire , with two impurities at a separation @xmath1 , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    ".,width=453 ]    the wire is modelled by a linear chain of atoms , with @xmath2 being the atomic - site energy , @xmath3 the bond energy , and @xmath4 the nearest - neighbour overlap .",
    "the impurities , at the sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 , have modified site energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , with the obvious feature that the system reduces to a one - impurity chain by setting @xmath9 .",
    "transmission through such a wire for the case of no overlap ( @xmath10 ) has been treated by mikovi _",
    "et al _ @xcite , from which the extension to the case @xmath11 is straightforward , using the method of reference @xcite . to this end , with some changes in notation , the mikovi equation ( 21 ) for the transmission probability becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 here , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 the fundamental mathematical change in including overlap is that the bond energy @xmath3 is replaced by the energy - dependent quantity @xmath19 .",
    "conversely , if overlap is removed by setting @xmath10 , then the above results reduce to those of @xcite .",
    "the renormalization technique @xcite provides an efficient avenue to investigate complicated structures , by rescaling them into simpler ones , with one or more parameters becoming energy - dependent . although the method is most commonly used without inclusion of overlap , it is straightforward to do so .",
    "we here illustrate the method by looking at its application to the simplest system of interest in this paper , namely a linear chain with a single extra atom attached at the side of site 0 ( see figure [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "the pure chain is as described in the last section , while the side - atom has a site energy @xmath7 , bond energy @xmath20 and overlap @xmath21 . within the tight - binding approximation ,",
    "the discretized schrdinger equation takes the well - known form @xcite of a set of second - order difference equations , which for the system under consideration is : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 renormalization proceeds by eliminating @xmath25 from the set .",
    "equation ( [ eq10 ] ) can be solved as @xmath26 which , when substituted into ( [ eq9 ] ) , produces @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the renormalized site energy .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq10 ] ) has been eliminated , leaving the system of equations as ( [ eq8 ] ) along with ( [ eq12 ] ) , and represented schematically by figure [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the procedure can be extended to more complicated systems , as will be seen in the next section , by eliminating sites , one - by - one , starting at the end of a branch , which corresponds mathematically to recursive application of ( [ eq13 ] ) to produce the renormalized site energy at the `` root '' site , which appears as an impurity in the chain .",
    "we now proceed to investigate electron transmission through certain branched atomic - wire systems , by using the renormalization method to reduce such systems to linear chains with one or two impurities , whose transmission is then given by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the first system under study is an atomic wire with a single side branch , which itself has a sub - branch ( see figure [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "the branch is of length @xmath29 , and is attached to the main wire at site @xmath5 .",
    "each atom in the side branch has site energy @xmath7 , bond energy @xmath20 and overlap @xmath21 .",
    "the sub - branch is attached to the primary branch at site @xmath30 , and , for simplicity , the sub - branch is taken to consist of just a single atom , although the generalization to a longer sub - branch is straightforward .",
    "the atom comprising the sub - branch is taken to have site energy @xmath31 , bond energy @xmath32 and overlap @xmath33 .",
    "the first step in the renormalization process is to delete the sub - branch atom , resulting in a rescaled atom at site @xmath30 ( figure [ fig3](b ) ) , whose site energy , using ( [ eq13 ] ) , is @xmath34 the second step is to decimate the branch , atom by atom , starting at the free end ( @xmath35 ) , through repeated application of ( [ eq13 ] ) , resulting in only a chain with a rescaled atom at site @xmath5 ( figure [ fig3](c ) ) , whose site energy can be written in continued - fraction form as @xmath36 where the term @xmath37 occurs at position @xmath38 ( counting from the left end of the continued fraction ) . alternatively , ( [ eq15 ] ) can be expressed more compactly using gauss notation as @xmath39    , \\label{eq15a}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 hence , the transmission can be calculated as that through a 1-impurity wire , by using equations ( [ eq1])-([eq7 ] ) , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "next , we turn to the system of an atomic wire with @xmath43 branches attached at the same site ( @xmath5 ) , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .        on branch",
    "@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , which is of length @xmath46 , the atoms have site energy @xmath47 , bond energy @xmath48 and overlap @xmath49",
    ". each branch can be decimated via the renormalization procedure , as was done in the previous subsection , albeit without sub - branches attached .",
    "consequently , each branch contributes to @xmath50 a continued fraction of the form appearing in ( [ eq15a ] ) , resulting in the rescaled site - energy at site @xmath5 being @xmath51       \\",
    "\\big )   . \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] thus , as in the last subsection , the transmission is through a rescaled 1-impurity wire , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the last system under investigation is an atomic wire , with a pair of branches attached at sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    ".,width=453 ]    the branches are of lengths @xmath29 and @xmath52 , respectively , and have associated site energies @xmath53 , bond energies @xmath54 and overlaps @xmath55 , with @xmath56 . each branch can be decimated , atom by atom , as in the preceding subsections by the repeated application of ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "consequently , sites 0 and @xmath1 of the chain become occupied by rescaled atoms with site energies @xmath57    , ~k = a ~{\\rm or}~b , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "hence , the transmission @xmath0 can be calculated , via ( [ eq1 ] ) , as that through a 2-impurity wire , with @xmath41 and @xmath58 .",
    "we now proceed to examine the @xmath0 curves for the three systems , for some specific values of the various parameters . in order to provide some degree of uniformity , we take as `` standard '' values , all site energies @xmath2 s to be 0 , bond energies @xmath3 s to be -0.5 and overlaps @xmath4 s to be 0.25 , except as otherwise stated .    turning first to the system of a chain with one branch plus a side - atom , the key parameters to investigate are the length of the branch @xmath29 and the postion @xmath38 of the side - atom on that branch . with respect to the former , figure [ fig6 ]",
    "shows the @xmath0 graphs for several branch lengths , with the side - atom set at position @xmath59 , i.e. , attached to the branch - atom closest to the main chain .     for chain with branch , plus side - atom attached at position @xmath59 .",
    "the branch is of length @xmath60 ( a ) 1 ( solid curve ) , ( b ) 2 ( dotted ) , ( c ) 3 ( dashed ) , ( d ) 4 ( dash - dotted).,width=453 ]    starting with the case @xmath61 ( figure [ fig6](a ) ) , we see a single resonance ( @xmath62 ) at @xmath63 , flanked by a pair of anti - resonances ( @xmath64 ) , which separate the central peak from two smaller ones nearer the band edges . by comparison ,",
    "@xmath0 for a chain with a branch , but no side - atom , shows one resonance and just a single anti - resonance ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) , while that for a bare chain , with no branch , shows only the single resonance and no anti - resonances at all ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "moving to a branch of length @xmath65 ( figure [ fig6](b ) ) , we see a very similar @xmath0 curve , namely , a large central peak with resonance at @xmath63 , with 2 smaller peaks at the sides , albeit with the 2 anti - resonances shifted somewhat outwards , towards the band edges .",
    "however , further lengthening of the branch to @xmath66 ( figure [ fig6](c ) ) produces a very different @xmath0 curve , in which the central peak has split into 3 , each achieving a resonance , while the 2 outermost peaks are further diminished , and also narrowed , by virtue of their bounding anti - resonances again moving further outwards .",
    "these features are repeated in the next longer branch ( @xmath67 in figure [ fig6](d ) ) , but once more with all anti - resonances moving outwards .",
    "this pattern is repeated as the branch is further lengthened ( graphs not shown ) , with pairs of graphs for branch lengths @xmath68 and @xmath69 appearing very similar , but with an additional pair of anti - resonances appearing , due to a split of the central peak , in going to lengths @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 curves , on the position @xmath38 of the side - atom on the branch , is illustrated in figure [ fig7 ] , for a branch of length @xmath67 .",
    "for chain with branch of length @xmath67 , plus side - atom attached at position @xmath72 ( a ) 1 ( solid curve ) , ( b ) 2 ( dotted ) , ( c ) 3 ( dashed ) , ( d ) 4 ( dash - dotted).,width=453 ]    the graph for @xmath59 ( figure [ fig7](a ) ) , it should be noted , is that appearing in figure [ fig6](d ) , again showing the structure of 5 peaks , 3 of them resonances , divided by 4 anti - resonances .",
    "when the side - atom is moved outwards along the branch to position @xmath73 ( figure [ fig7](b ) ) , the central resonance , centered at @xmath63 , is split into a pair of narrower resonances , accompanied by some shifting of the anti - resonances , so as to broaden the other 2 resonances .",
    "as the side - atom is moved again to @xmath74 ( figure [ fig7](c ) ) , however , these 2 new resonances recombine into a single one at @xmath63 , with the 2 outer resonances relatively unchanged .",
    "the graph now looks very similar to that for @xmath59 in figure [ fig7](a ) , in terms of number of resonances and anti - resonances , except that the central resonance peak has been narrowed , allowing broadening of the outer two . with an increase to @xmath75 ( figure [ fig7](d ) )",
    ", the central resonance agains splits into a pair of resonances .",
    "this pattern repeats itself , on branches of arbitrary length , as @xmath38 increases , namely , the number of resonances oscillates as the central resonance splits in two and then recombines .",
    "a detailed mathematical analysis can reveal much about the features seen in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] and , in particular , about the dependance on the parameters of the number of anti - resonances , which largely determines the overall structure of the graphs . referring to equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    ", it can be seen that in order for an anti - resonance to occur , i.e. , @xmath64 , it is necessary that @xmath76 .",
    "looking at ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath42 ( as indicated in section 5.1 ) giving @xmath77 , thus leaving only @xmath25 to consider . for @xmath78 in ( [ eq2 ] ) requires that @xmath79 , as it can be shown that @xmath80 and @xmath81 only at the band edges ( where t always equals 0 , so these two energies are not considered to be anti - resonances ) .",
    "thus , anti - resonances correspond to singularities of @xmath82 , which can be located by analyzing ( [ eq15a ] ) , with the result that the maximum , and `` usual '' , number of anti - resonances equals @xmath83 , namely , the total number of atomic sites in the entire side - structure ( branch plus side - atom ) .",
    "however , for some parameter values , symmetry considerations can cause a coalescence of 2 anti - resonances , in a situation reminiscent of degeneracy .",
    "suppose @xmath84 , as is the case here .",
    "if , for example , @xmath85 , then the side - structure has a symmetrical y - shape , which results in the coalescence of 2 anti - resonances , thus dropping the total number to just @xmath29 .",
    "this feature does not happen when @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "it depends upon the parity ( even or odd ) of @xmath38 compared to that of @xmath29 , and it turns out that the number of anti - resonances is @xmath83 when @xmath38 and @xmath29 have the same parity , but the number drops to @xmath29 , when they have opposite parity .",
    "it should be noted that , if @xmath88 , then the symmetry consideration does not hold , and the number of anti - resonances is @xmath89 .",
    "these considerations explain the basic structure of the two figures .",
    "firstly , in figure [ fig6 ] , increasing @xmath29 , while holding @xmath38 constant , switches the parity back and forth , resulting in pairs of graphs , with branch lengths @xmath68 and @xmath69 , having the same number of anti - resonances . secondly , in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , increasing @xmath38 , while holding @xmath29 constant , also flips the parity , causing the number of anti - resonances to oscillate up and down .    turning next to the system of a chain with multiple branches attached at one site , the most important parameters are the number of branches @xmath43 and their lengths @xmath46 .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with the number of branches is illustrated in figure [ fig8 ] , for branches of length 2 .",
    "for chain with branches of length @xmath90 , the number of branches being @xmath91 ( a ) 1 ( solid curve ) , ( b ) 2 ( dotted ) , ( c ) 3 ( dashed).,width=453 ]    for only a single branch ( figure [ fig8](a ) ) , @xmath0 shows a single resonance peak at @xmath63 , with a pair of smaller peaks to the sides , separated by a pair of anti - resonances , at @xmath92 and @xmath93 . adding a second branch produces a similar @xmath0 curve ( figure [ fig8](b ) ) , in that the resonance and the two anti - resonances persist at their previous energies .",
    "however , there is a general dampening of the transmission , resulting in lower @xmath0 at all energies , except the resonance .",
    "this effect is enhanced with the addition of a third branch ( figure [ fig8](c ) ) , where transmission is further suppressed , but with the resonance and both anti - resonances preserved . in the more general situation , where atoms on different branches have different site energies ( @xmath2 s ) , more anti - resonances ( and , hence , more peaks )",
    "appear , but the addition of more branches again has the overall effect of lowering transmission .",
    "thus , we make the general observation that more branches is inhibitive to transmission .    the dependence of @xmath0 on the length of branches is shown in figure [ fig9 ] , where the number of branches is taken to be 3 .     for chain with @xmath94 branches , all of length @xmath95 ( a ) 1 ( solid curve ) , ( b ) 2 ( dotted ) , ( c ) 3 ( dashed).,width=453 ]    for branches of length 1 (",
    "i.e. , they are individual atoms ) , the @xmath0 curve ( figure [ fig9](a ) ) shows relatively low transmission at all energies , with a single anti - resonance at @xmath63 separating two small peaks .",
    "increasing the lengths of the branches to 2 produces a markedly different structure ( figure [ fig9](b ) ) , in which a central peak , with a resonance at @xmath63 , appears , with 2 much smaller peaks to the sides , and a pair of anti - resonances separating them from the central peak .",
    "a further increase of the branch lengths to 3 ( figure [ fig9](c ) ) produces a third anti - resonance , with the 2 central peaks now becoming resonances , and the 2 outside peaks showing even lower transmission .",
    "this trend continues as the chains are further lengthened , with additional anti - resonances appearing and all the resulting peaks , except the 2 outer ones , showing resonances . as an individual branch",
    "is lengthened ( graphs not shown ) , the number of anti - resonances increases in a pattern similar to that noted earlier , in the discussion of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "much of the basic structure of this system can be illuminated by , as before , analyzing the number of anti - resonances , as illustrated in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] . as with the first system , anti - resonances are calculated as singularities of @xmath82 , now using ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "the main result from earlier is still valid , namely , that the maximum number of anti - resonances arising from a branch equals the length @xmath46 of the branch .",
    "thus , for a system with @xmath43 branches , the maximum number of anti - resonances in the system equals @xmath96 .",
    "however , for the parameter values used here , where each branch is assumed to have identical atoms , so that corresponding parameters ( @xmath47 , etc , ) are equal , the number of anti - resonances may turn out to be less than the maximum .",
    "in particular , if the branches all have equal length , as is the case in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , then the anti - resonances arising from one branch coincide with those from the other branches , so that the number of anti - resonances equals the common branch length @xmath46 .",
    "but if the branch lengths are unequal , then typically the anti - resonances from different branches do not coincide , and there is no reduction in total number from the maximum .",
    "lastly , turning to the system of a chain with a pair of branches , at separate sites , the significant parameters are the separation @xmath1 between the two branches , and their lengths @xmath29 and @xmath52 .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with the separation between branches is shown in figure [ fig10 ] , for branches of fixed lengths 1 and 3 .",
    "for chain with 2 branches , of lengths @xmath61 and @xmath97 , and at separation @xmath98 ( a ) 1 ( solid curve ) , ( b ) 2 ( dotted ) , ( c ) 3 ( dashed ) , ( d ) 4 ( dash - dotted).,width=453 ]    ( it should be noted that @xmath0 is invariant to interchange of the lengths @xmath29 and @xmath52 . ) when the branches are attached to adjacent sites in the chain , corresponding to @xmath99 ( figure [ fig10](a ) ) , the @xmath0 curve shows a structure which is quasi - symmetric about @xmath63 .",
    "( in the case where there is no overlap , the curve is precisely symmetric . )",
    "there are 3 anti - resonances , including one at @xmath63 , which divide the band region into 4 zones of transmission , albeit with no resonances .",
    "as the separation increases ( figure [ fig9](b - d ) ) , the number and positions of the anti - resonances do not change , leading to a very similar graph for @xmath100 , but to noticeably different ones for @xmath101 and 4 , where the inner pair of peaks exhibit some rearrangement to produce double - peaked structures , while the outer pair are greatly diminished , at least for @xmath102 . for further increases in separation ( graphs not shown ) ,",
    "the three anti - resonances remain pinned at their energy values , while the transmittivity continues to be dominated by the inner pair of sub - bands , which gradually add extra peaks within each zone .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with branch length is exemplified by figure [ fig11 ] , where the length @xmath52 of one branch is varied , while the other @xmath61 is held constant , with fixed separation @xmath100 .     for chain with 2 branches , at separation @xmath100 , and lengths @xmath61 and @xmath103 ( a ) 1 ( solid curve ) , ( b ) 2 ( dotted ) ,",
    "( c ) 3 ( dashed ) , ( d ) 4 ( dash - dotted).,width=453 ]    for the shortest branch @xmath104 ( figure [ fig11](a ) ) , there is a single anti - resonance at @xmath63 separating two bands of transmission , with resonances at about @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the asymmetry , produced by the presence of overlap , distorts the @xmath0 curve , so that the part of the band most amenable to transmission is at the higher energies . as the branch",
    "is lengthened to @xmath107 ( figure [ fig11](b ) ) , each region of transmission is split into two by the creation of a pair on anti - resonances , while the heights of all 4 peaks are lowered , so as to remove both resonances .",
    "the result , then , is an overall weakening of the transmittivity of the wire , except at certain energies . lengthening the branch again to @xmath97 ( figure [ fig11](c ) )",
    "produces a graph very similar to the previous one , with the same number of anti - resonances and peaks , but with some shifting of their energies ( except , noticeably , the anti - resonance at @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , a further lengthening of the branch to @xmath108 creates a splitting of the two inner peaks ( figure [ fig11](d ) ) , for a total of 6 , separated by 5 anti - resonances ( including the fixed one at @xmath63 ) .",
    "the net effect is an overall lowering of the transmittivity , except at and near the peaks .",
    "the structure in the graph for @xmath108 persists at @xmath109 ( not shown ) , but when @xmath110 , there is a further splitting of the innermost pair of peaks , accompanied by the appearance of an extra pair of anti - resonances .",
    "thus , we see a pattern that is reminiscent of that observed with the lengthening of branches in the two earlier systems .",
    "an analysis of the anti - resonances follows similar lines to that presented for the other two systems , but now utilizing ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "first , we note that the number and positions of anti - resonances are independent of the separation @xmath1 between the two branches , as can be seen in figure [ fig10 ] . in general",
    ", there are anti - resonances associated with each branch , the number being equal to the length of the branch , so that the maximum number of anti - resonances is @xmath111 . however , as in the earlier systems , taking corresponding parameters on the two branches to be equal , typically reduces the actual number of anti - resonances .",
    "specifically , this reduction occurs when @xmath29 and @xmath52 are both odd , which results in @xmath112 being an anti - resonance energy for both branches , thus reducing the total number , by 1 , to @xmath113 . for certain other combinations of lengths",
    ", the total number of anti - resonances can also be reduced .",
    "a special situation occurs when @xmath114 , with corresponding parameters equal , so that the two branches are identical . in this case",
    ", the number of anti - resonances equals the common length @xmath29 .",
    "these considerations explain the pattern of anti - resonances seen in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "starting from the bare atomic wire , more complicated electronic systems can be built , by adding one or more side branches , at one or more sites , along the wire . by examining these different structures",
    ", we can gain insight into those variations which produce the most useful properties .",
    "the present work utilizes the renormalization - decimation method , whereby all the side branches , attached to a particular site , were reduced to an impurity replacing the original atom at that site .",
    "subsequently , the transmission probability @xmath0 through the wire was calculated by means of the established lippmann - schwinger technique .    in all of the three systems examined , the key to understanding the @xmath0 curve lies in the number and positions of anti - resonances and resonances ( or smaller maxima ) . these in turn can be varied and controlled by means of the system s main parameters , such as the length of a side branch , thus indicating that the wire can be constructed to have a fairly specific @xmath0 profile , through a judicious choice of the attached structures .",
    "it is interesting to note that the results of the present study indicate that the renormalization - decimation technique may be a useful tool in the area of chemisorption .",
    "for example , it could be used to investigate the chemisorption properties of a molecule adsorbed onto an atomic wire , by treating the admolecule similarly to the side - structures of this paper .",
    "in such a case , the admolecule can be renormalized down to a single impurity in the wire , thus simplifying the chemisorption calculation .",
