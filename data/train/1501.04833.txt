    "<S> single ionization of noble gas atoms by linearly polarized synchrotron radiation has been studied by employing angle- and energy - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were carried out in the plane defined by the momentum and polarization vectors of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> parameters describing the left - right asymmetry ( lra ) ( relative to the photon propagation direction ) of the photoelectron angular distribution were determined experimentally for the @xmath0-shells of he , ne , ar , kr and xe atoms and h@xmath1 molecules and for the @xmath2-shells of ne , ar , kr and xe atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the left - right asymmetry differ significantly from zero for both subshells . </S>",
    "<S> the photon and photoelectron energy dependence of the lra parameters are presented also . </S>",
    "<S> possible experimental and instrumental sources that could generate asymmetry are discussed and excluded as well . </S>"
