    "the external potential @xmath14 accounts for the external force fields in which the crystal is embedded ; in specific , @xmath15 takes into account the forces acting on the grains ( and balancing each other at equilibrium , ensuring stability ) in the vertical direction ( i.e. gravity , electric and/or magnetic forces ) ; it may also include the parabolic horizontal confinement potential imposed in experiments for stability @xcite as well as , for completeness , the initial laser excitation triggering the oscillations in experiments .      considering the motion of the @xmath9th dust grain in both the _ longitudinal _ ( horizontal , @xmath16 ) and the _ transverse _ ( vertical , off  plane , @xmath1 ) directions ( i.e. suppressing the transverse in - plane  shear  component , @xmath17 ) , so that @xmath18 , we have the two - dimensional ( in @xmath19 ) equation of motion @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ( interaction ) electrostatic field and @xmath22 accounts for all external forces in the @xmath23 direction ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) ; the usual _ ad hoc _ damping term was introduced in the left - hand - side of eq .",
