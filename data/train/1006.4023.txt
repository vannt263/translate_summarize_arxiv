    "the dynamics of rough surfaces in systems exhibiting avalanches or bursts of activity in response to a slow external driving has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "physical examples include fracture cracks  @xcite , fluid imbibition fronts in porous media  @xcite , or the motion of domain - walls in magnets  @xcite . by means of high resolution",
    "fast imaging techniques it has recently been possible to characterize experimentally avalanche dynamics of activity from either the local velocity map  @xcite or the average velocity time series  @xcite . a fundamental problem is to understand the role played by local fluctuations ( avalanches ) in the building up of large - scale space - time interface correlations and scale - invariant roughening .    in this paper we show that _ local _ activity statistics , avalanche scaling properties , and time correlations ( in both , the surface and the _ global _ velocity - fluctuations ) are generically connected through scaling relations that we derive by means of simple scaling arguments .",
    "depending on the form of probability distribution of the first - return time of activity to a given site , we divide avalanche driven surface growth systems into two separate classes as follows . we consider that driven systems can exhibit either _ off - critical _ or _",
    "critical _ ( fractal ) spatio - temporal activity , and the scaling relations among the corresponding exponents are different for each class . on the one hand , there are systems where scale - invariant interface growth emerges from off - critical spatio - temporal patterns of activity , where avalanches have a finite extent and the probability for the activity to return to any given place is short tailed . on the other hand ,",
    "there are growing interfaces where local activity is critical , showing fractal patterns in space and/or time .",
    "examples include systems at the depinning transition as well as interface systems that self - organize into a critical state .",
    "this leads to critical avalanches of activity with fat tails that lead to strong fluctuations of the avalanche size , avalanche extent , and first return time of activity . in both cases , however , we find that the interface space - time correlations turn out to be related to the spatio - temporal activity , leading then to a connection between local and global quantities via scaling relationships that we obtain .",
    "our arguments are very general and we expect our results to be widely applicable in systems where surface roughness fluctuations are driven by local avalanches .    as an example of much current interest , we apply the scaling theory to the problem of forced - flow imbibition fronts , which occurs when a viscous fluid advances through a disordered media displacing a less viscous fluid ( typically air )  @xcite . in forced - flow imbibition",
    "experiments a constant fluid injection rate is applied while the spatially averaged velocity of the liquid - air interface @xmath0 is kept constant  @xcite .",
    "this system exhibits a natural characteristic length scale @xmath1  @xcite corresponding to the typical extent of interface correlations , which can be controlled by the injection rate .",
    "therefore , imbibition offers an excellent example where the theory we shall present here can be tested , since the system may be either in an off - critical regime ( @xmath2 ) with avalanches extending over short length scales of order @xmath3 , or fronts can be driven into a critical regime ( @xmath4 ) by simply tuning the fluid injection rate .",
    "interestingly , these regimes can be accesible to experimentation  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we study the local aspects of the interface dynamics in terms of activity statistics , where we give the exact definitions of critical and off - critical activity .",
    "we also study there the avalanche kinetics , where we present the different scaling relations among the local quantities describing avalanches . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the global dynamics of the interface by means of the multiscaling properties of the surface and the mean interface velocity time - correlations .",
    "all the different quantities defined thoughout the paper are then studied numerically in forced - flow imbibition fronts in sec .",
    "the final conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we consider an advancing interface @xmath5 in @xmath6 dimensions where @xmath7 is the substrate position and @xmath8 is time .",
    "a site @xmath7 is said to be active at a given time if it is moving . for discrete models",
    "this corresponds to sites to be updated , @xmath9 , in the next time step . for continuous systems defining single site activity",
    "is more cumbersome but it can be effectively done by considering a site is active whenever the local velocity is above some fixed threshold . in order to characterize the local spatio - temporal activity we calculate the first - return time probability density , @xmath10 , for a site @xmath7 to become active again after a period of inactivity @xmath11 .",
    "this probability describes the time duration of intervals separating subsequent returns of activity at any given site so that the average number of returns @xmath12 in a time interval of duration @xmath11 satisfies  @xcite @xmath13 where the temporal resolution can be set to unity , @xmath14 , without loss of generality .    in systems far from a critical point , which we denote as off - critical systems , activity is expected to be described by a general scaling function : @xmath15 such that @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a normalization constant so that @xmath19 is fulfilled .",
    "the average return time in this case is simply @xmath20 and thus a finite average surface velocity @xmath21 exists .",
    "a very common example are systems where the return of activity is a poison process , so that the time interval distribution is simply exponential @xmath22 . in the case of systems exhibiting some degree of correlation between two consecutive returns of activity to a given site the distribution is more likely to be described by @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents an effective exponent characterizing the power - law regime .",
    "this case will also be classified as off - critical here since there still exists a finite average surface velocity with the average return time also given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : return time ] ) .",
    "in contrast , under certain circumstances , some systems may show patterns of activity recurrence that become critical or fractal ( _ i.e. _ scale - invariant ) in time in such a way that the first - return time probability density exhibits a power - law asymptotic tail : @xmath25 with exponent @xmath26 for the distribution to be properly normalizable . in this case , in the long time limit we obtain that the average number of return points is @xmath27 with some critical exponent within the range @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "note that , for @xmath29 , although the activity is still described by a power - law , the system is actually off - critical due to the existence of a finite return time @xmath30 , _ i.e. _ , returns become dense in time , and the interface advances at finite velocity ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath32 returns rarely occur and activity is said to be fractal in time . in this case , the infinite average return time @xmath33 typical of a critical dynamics .",
    "fractal activity occurs , for instance , near a pinning / depinning critical transition ( @xmath34 ) or in surface growth models that self - organize into the critical state .",
    "an avalanche is defined as a spatially connected cluster of active sites .",
    "avalanches are characterized by the typical size @xmath35 of an event of lateral spatial extent @xmath36 .",
    "the duration and lateral extent of an event are related , @xmath37 , via the avalanche dynamic exponent @xmath38 .",
    "one expects the average avalanche size to scale with the lateral extent up to the cutoff length scale ( if any ) : @xmath39 for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the avalanche dimension exponent .",
    "conversely , one also expects to observe a scaling relation @xmath42 between size @xmath43 and duration @xmath8 of avalanches .",
    "since an avalanche of lateral length @xmath36 leads to a fluctuation of the surface height of the order of the _ local _ width @xmath44 , @xmath45 can be easily related to the _ local _ roughness exponent @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for a surface in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "likewise , the avalanche size - duration exponent @xmath49 can then be obtained from the identity @xmath50 and we find @xmath51which connects avalanche dynamics with surface roughness  @xcite .    in the case of off - critical activity , non - critical avalanches with a typical spatial extent cutoff @xmath3 are expected so that durations are also bounded and scaling only holds for @xmath52 .",
    "the avalanche size can be written in terms of the average velocity associated with the event as @xmath53 , for an avalanche of lateral extent @xmath36 and duration @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the typical velocity of the avalanche scales with the avalanche size as @xmath54 .",
    "the identity @xmath55 leads to @xmath56 and we obtain the scaling relation @xmath57relating surface roughness and avalanche exponents in the case of off - critical activity ( non - critical avalanches ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ z_av ] ) gives account of possible inter - event correlations .",
    "for instance , in the case of uncorrelated avalanches , typically , one should expect gaussian fluctuations of the avalanche velocity and @xmath59 , giving @xmath60 .",
    "avalanches are initiated in places favored given the disordered background .",
    "if this disorder is spatially uncorrelated it follows that avalanche velocity should also be uncorrelated and @xmath61 .",
    "correlations in the random medium can produce non trivial correlations in the avalanche velocity and that possibility is contemplated here .",
    "also , in the case of non disordered systems , where movement is driven by some external noise , the same argument applies since the noise may be either white or correlated .",
    "we have assumed a general situation by introducing the exponent @xmath58 that accounts for possible velocity correlations in case they exist .",
    "a different result is obtained for driven surfaces exhibiting a fractal profile of activity which leads to critical avalanches with no characteristic length or time scales ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this is an interesting case because it includes surfaces near the pinning / depinning transition , surfaces driven into self - organized critical states , and surfaces obeying extremal dynamics , among other surface models in the critical state . as discussed above , avalanches in the presence of fractal activity do not have a finite velocity since the average number of returns of activity to a given site is @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "this means that the scaling relation ( [ z_av ] ) does not apply .",
    "however , the scaling relation between avalanche size and local width , @xmath65 , is indeed valid also in this case , but with @xmath63 .",
    "thus we find the scaling relation  @xcite @xmath66which connects the local roughness with the statistics of the first - return time of surfaces exhibiting a fractal activity .",
    "having activity in the form of localized avalanches implies that growth is highly inhomogeneous in space with many time scales involved , which , in turn , may produce multiscaling of the height - height correlations  @xcite . as it is shown below , this can give information about local properties through global observables . to this end",
    "we define @xmath67 and investigate the generalized @xmath68-height - height correlation function in the saturated regime @xmath69 where the over bar is a spatial average and brackets denote average over independent realizations .",
    "when the exponents @xmath70 depend on @xmath68 the surface is said to exhibit multiscaling and this indicates a highly non trivial probability distribution of the height fluctuations .",
    "we are interested in obtaining @xmath70 as a function of the roughness and activity exponents .    in the limit @xmath71 only the site with the maximum growth , @xmath72 , contributes and we have @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 becomes an important quantity since it corresponds to the typical height fluctuation produced on the surface by avalanche events in a time interval @xmath8 . for time intervals",
    "@xmath8 shorter than the average avalanche duration cutoff ( @xmath75 ) we have @xmath76 , where the exponent is @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast , in time scales longer than the typical event duration ( @xmath78 ) surface fluctuations are no longer spatially localized vary many avalanches occurring at different parts of the surface overlap and contribute to the fluctuation",
    ". therefore surface height fluctuations must become spatially homogeneous at long time scales ( @xmath78 ) and the typical growth @xmath74 should scale with the global surface width @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the _ global _ roughness exponent .",
    "these two limiting behaviors can be put as @xmath81 where the crossover time @xmath82 is the average avalanche duration . in the case of off - critical activity",
    "@xmath82 is finite , while it diverges for fractal activity .    for a system of lateral extent @xmath83 ,",
    "surface fluctuations over time scales @xmath84 involve localized avalanche events of activity and so only a fraction of the surface @xmath85 is moving . by using eq .",
    "( [ h_max ] ) , we can roughly estimate that a term of the form @xmath86 for @xmath87 scales as @xmath88^m   \\sim t^{m \\beta_\\infty + d / z_\\mathrm{av}}l^{-d},\\ ] ] for fluctuations at time scales @xmath75 , while it becomes @xmath89 for @xmath78 .",
    "now , note that in the temporal regime @xmath90 of interest here , the main contribution in eq .",
    "( [ cq ] ) comes from the term @xmath91 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath92 , with @xmath93 that gives the multiscaling exponents @xmath70 induced in the surface fluctuations by the localized avalanche dynamics , valid for both off - critical ( finite @xmath82 ) and fractal ( unbounded @xmath82 ) distributions of activity . the exponent for the infinite moment",
    "can then be obtained by considering that a height fluctuation at time scales @xmath75 corresponds to an avalanche of lateral extent @xmath36 and is given by @xmath94 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) we have @xmath95 .",
    "it is interesting to particularize these results for the case of models exhibiting _ extremal _ dynamics  @xcite , where the avalanche - duration exponent is @xmath96 ( only one site is growing at any given time ) and we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 with @xmath62 since the model is critical , in agreement with existing results for critical depinning models with extremal dynamics  @xcite .    the presence of multiscaling is due to the infinitely many time scales involved in the problem that are induced by a highly inhomogeneous surface growth .",
    "an illustrative way to show this is to note that the time scale defined by @xmath99 is associated with the avalanche size - duration exponent @xmath49 since , from eq .",
    "( [ beta_q ] ) , @xmath100 [ _ cf . _",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ] . in the other limit , when @xmath71 , we have @xmath95 that corresponds to the time scale of single - site activity .",
    "this observation is transparent for a fractal activity distribution where @xmath101 can be related to the average number of returns to a given site , @xmath102 .",
    "this gives @xmath103 , which corresponds to the previously derived scaling relation  ( [ tau_f ] ) .",
    "this allows us to immediately associate the @xmath104- correlation moment ( a global observable ) with the distribution of the return times of activity at any given site ( a local observable ) .",
    "this is useful for experiments , where single site motion , and therefore local observables , may be difficult to measure .",
    "recently , there has been much interest  @xcite in obtaining information about the avalanche kinetics from the scaling behavior of the global activity / velocity fluctuations .",
    "this is particularly important in experiments where the global velocity time series is readily available , while it is difficult to monitor microscopic avalanches .",
    "the scaling relations obtained in the preceding sections can be used to give a full solution to this problem in the context of surface growth .    in the stationary state ,",

    "equivalently , we can compute the velocity fluctuation spectrum @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the fourier component at frequency @xmath110 .",
    "generally , one expects @xmath111 where @xmath112 is hurst exponent of the velocity time series , while in fourier space we have @xmath113 , with @xmath114 . since @xmath115",

    "we have @xmath121 leading to the scaling exponent @xmath122 which relates the low - frequency behavior of the velocity - fluctuation spectrum to the roughness properties of the surface .",
    "this formula generalizes an earlier analytical result  @xcite , @xmath123 , valid for the kardar - parisi - zhang equation  @xcite .",
    "this scaling behavior holds for frequencies above @xmath124 , below which the spectrum becomes flat .",
    "calculated at different velocities .",
    "it reflects an off - critical activity ( moderate velocities : @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) , characterized by : @xmath127 with effective exponents of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",

    "we now apply the above scaling theory to the problem of forced - flow imbibition in disordered media  @xcite .",

    "@xmath154 models capillary disorder and favors the liquid ( wet ) phase , forcing the interface to advance at the expense of the air ( dry ) phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath155 in the above equation is the mobility which we take constant at the liquid phase ( @xmath156 ) and zero at the air phase ( @xmath157 ) . in our numerical model",
    "we have used a spatially distributed dichotomic quenched noise and the results have been averaged over @xmath158 disorder realizations .",
    "the interface position @xmath159 separating the wet and dry phases is computed . a site on the interface is active at time @xmath8 if its local velocity is above some fixed threshold , @xmath160 , where @xmath134 is some arbitrary constant .",
    "in fig  [ fig1](a ) we plot the distribution of first - return times of activity to any given site .",
    "we see that for moderate velocities , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the activity is an exponentially cut - off power - law with an exponent that depends on the mean velocity , while it tends to be pure power - law distributed for very low velocities , @xmath163 , where we obtain @xmath164 over a range of more than three decades .",
    "these distributions of activity correspond to the fact that the characteristic avalanche size ( and duration ) diverges as one gets closer to the pinned state , @xmath165  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention here that the observed results do not depend on the choice of the arbitrary threshold @xmath134 .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) shows that changing the value of @xmath134 only introduces an artificial cut - off but does not change the exponent , something already observed in ref .",

    "we expect our prediction for @xmath70 to become better as @xmath82 becomes larger ( see below ) .     at high velocities and @xmath174 at low velocities in agreement with the theoretical prediction @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    regarding the velocity fluctuations spectrum",

    "the scaling behavior changes dramatically when we drive the front at very low velocities , where the activity statistics becomes approximatively fractal ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
