    "the discovery of the extrasolar planets @xcite around solar - type stars indeed provides substantial clues for the formation and origin of our own solar system . according to standard theory @xcite",
    ", it is generally believed that planet formation may experience such several stages : in the early stage , the dust grains condense to grow km - sized planetesimals ; in the middle stage , moon - to - mars sized embryos are created by accretion of planetesimals . when the embryos grow up to a core of @xmath2 ,",
    "runaway accretion may take place . with more gases accreted onto the solid core ,",
    "the embryos become more massive and eventually collapse to produce giant jovian planets @xcite . at the end of the stage , it is around that the protostar has formed for about @xmath3 myr , the gas disk has dissipated . a few larger bodies with low @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are in crowds of planetesimals with certain eccentricities and inclinations . in the late stage ,",
    "the terrestrial embryos are excited to high eccentricity orbits by mutual gravitational perturbation .",
    "next , the orbital crossings make planets obtain material in wider radial area . in this sense ,",
    "solid residue is either scattered out of the planetary system or accreted by the massive planet , even being captured @xcite at the resonance position of the giant planets .",
    "@xcite made a study of terrestrial planet formation in the late stage by numerical simulations , who set @xmath6 moon - to - mars size planetary embryos in the area of @xmath7 au under mutual interactions from jupiter and saturn .",
    "he also examined two initial mass distributions : approximately uniform masses , and a bimodal mass distribution .",
    "the results show that @xmath8 planets are formed within @xmath9 myr , and finally survive over @xmath10 myr timescale , and the final planets usually have eccentric orbits with higher eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "@xcite also investigated the formation of terrestrial planets . in the simulations",
    ", they simply took into account jupiter s gravitational perturbation , and the distribution of material are in @xmath11 au . their results confirm a leading hypothesis for the origin of earth s water : they may come from the material in the outer area by impacts in the late stage of planet formation . @xcite explored the planet formation under planetary migration of the giant . in the simulations , super hot earth form interior to the migrating giant planet , and water - rich , earth - size terrestrial planet are present in the habitable zone ( @xmath12 au ) and can survive over @xmath1 yr timescale .    in our work",
    ", we consider two - planet model , in which jupiter and saturn are supposed to be already formed , with two swarms of planetesimals distributed in the region among @xmath13 au and @xmath14 au respectively .",
    "the initial eccentricities and inclinations of planetesimals are considered .",
    "we also vary the mass of saturn to examine how the small bodies evolve .",
    "the simulations are performed on longer timescale @xmath15 myr in order to check the stability and the dynamical structure evolution of the system . in the following ,",
    "we briefly summarize our numerical setup and results .",
    "the timescale for formation of jupiter - like planets is usually considered to be less than @xmath16 myr @xcite , the formation scenario of planet embryos is related to their heliocentric distances and the initial mass of the star nebular .",
    "if we adopt the model of @xmath17 mmsn ( minimum mass solar nebular ) , the upper bound of the timescale for jupiter - like planet formation corresponds to the timescale for embryo formation at @xmath18 au @xcite , which is just at @xmath19 resonance location of jupiter . in the region @xmath20",
    "au , embryos will be cleared off by strong perturbation from jupiter .",
    "there should be some much smaller solid residue among jupiter and saturn , even though the clearing effect may throw out most of the material in this area .",
    "we set embryos simply in the region @xmath21 au and planetesimals at @xmath13 au and @xmath22 au .",
    "we adopt the surface density profile as follows @xcite : @xmath23    in ( 2.1 ) , @xmath24 is the surface density at snowline , where the snowline is at @xmath18 au with @xmath25 .",
    "the mass of planetary embryos is proportional to the width of the feeding zone , which is associated with hill radius , @xmath26 , so the mass of an embryo increases as @xmath27    the embryos in the @xmath21 au are spaced by @xmath28 ( @xmath29 varying randomly between 2 and 5 ) mutual hill radii , @xmath30 , which is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the semi - major axes and masses of the embryos respectively . replacing @xmath26 in ( 2.2 ) with @xmath30 , and substituting ( 2.1 ) in ( 2.2 ) , then , we achieve a relation law between the mass of embryos and the parameter @xmath29 as @xmath34    here , we equally set the masses of planetesimals inside and outside jupiter , respectively .",
    "consequently , the number distribution of the planetesimals is simply required to meet @xmath35 . additionally , we remain the total number of planetesimals and embryos inside jupiter , and the number of planetesimals outside jupiter both equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the mass inside and outside jupiter is equal to be @xmath36 .",
    "the eccentricities and inclinations vary in ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "the mass of saturn in simulations 1a/1b , 2a/2b and 3a/3b are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 respectively .",

    "in addition , we adopt @xmath45 days as the length of time step , which is a twentieth period of the innermost body at @xmath46 au . all runs are carried out over @xmath15 myr time scale . at the end of the intergration ,",
    "the changes of energy and angular momenta are @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "six simulations are performed on a workstation composed of @xmath49 cpus with @xmath50 ghz , and each costs roughly @xmath51 days .",
    "1(a ) is a snapshot of simulation 2a . at @xmath52 myr ,",
    "it is clear that the planetesimals are excited at the @xmath53 ( @xmath54 au),@xmath55 ( @xmath56 au ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath18 au ) resonance positions with jupiter , and this is quite similar to the kirkwood gaps of the main asteroidal belt in solar system . for about @xmath57 myr , planetesimals and embryos are deeply intermixed , where most of the bodies have stirred to be large eccentricities .",
    "collisions and accretions frequently emerge among planetesimals and embryos",
    ". this process continues until about @xmath9 myr , and the planetary embryos are mostly generated .",
    "the formation timescale of embryos is in accordance with that of @xcite .",
    "finally , inside jupiter , @xmath3 terrestrial planets are formed with masses of @xmath0 . however , at the outer region , the planetesimals are continuously scattered out of the system at @xmath52 myr . for about @xmath16",
    "myr , there are no survivals except at some resonances with the giant planet .",
    "as shown in the figure , there is a small body at the @xmath58 resonance with jupiter . due to scattering amongst planetesimals ,",
    "jupiter ( saturn ) migrates inward ( outward ) @xmath59 au ( @xmath60 au ) toward the sun respectively .",
    "such kind of migration agrees with the work of fernandez et al .",
    "@xcite hence , the @xmath61 mean motion resonance is destroyed , then the ratios of periods between jupiter and saturn degenerate to @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of periods for jupiter , small body and saturn is approximate to @xmath63 . in the @xmath64 au ,",
    "when the eccentricities of planetesimals are excited , planetesimals are able to accrete material from wide radial direction . the plenty of water material of the terrestrial planet in the habitable zone may be transferred from the farther places by this mechanism .",
    "1(b ) is illustrated for simulation 2b . in comparison with fig .",
    "1(a ) , it is apparent that planetesimals are excited more quickly at the @xmath53 ( @xmath54 au ) , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 au ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath18 au ) resonance location with jupiter .",
    "the several characteristic timescales are the same as simulation 2a for the bodies within jupiter .",
    "4 planets are formed in simulation 2b , the changes of position of jupiter and saturn behaves like simulation 2a .",
    "we point out that simulations 2a and 2b share the initial conditions , but the only difference in them is whether we consider the self - gravitation among the outer planetesimals .",
    "there is a little gathered planetesimals survival over @xmath15 myr among @xmath65 au , located in the area of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 au ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath68 au ) resonances with jupiter .",
    "the detailed results for whole simulations that the reader may refer to @xcite .",
    "the production efficiency of the terrestrial planet in our model is high , and the accretion rate inside jupiter is @xmath69 in the simulations . @xmath70 terrestrial planets formed in @xmath9 myr . 5 of 6 simulations have a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone ( @xmath71 au ) .",
    "the planetary systems are formed to have nearly circular orbit and coplanarity , similar to the solar system ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we suppose that the above characteristics are correlated with the initial small eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "the concentration in table 1 means the ratio of maximum terrestrial planet formed in the simulation and the total terrestrial planets mass .",
    "it represents different capability on accretion .",
    "the average value of this parameter is similar to the solar system . considering the self - gravitation of planetesimals among jupiter and saturn ,",
    "the system has a better viscosity , so that the planetesimals will be excited slower .",
    "the consideration of self - gravitation may not change the formation time scale of terrestrial planets , but will affect the initial accretion speed and the eventual accretion rate .",
    ".properties of terrestrial planets from different systems [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we simulate the terrestrial planets formation by using two - planet model . in the simulation , the variations of the mass of outer planet , the initial eccentricities and inclinations of embryos and planetesimals are also considered .",
    "the results show that , during the terrestrial planets formation , planets can accrete material from different regions inside jupiter . among @xmath13 au ,",
    "the accretion rate of terrestrial planet is @xmath69 , i.e. , about @xmath72 initial mass is removed during the progress .",
    "the planetesimals will improve the efficiency of accretion rate for certain initial eccentricities and inclinations , and this also makes the newly - born terrestrial planets have lower orbital eccentricities .",
    "it is maybe a common phenomenon in the planet formation that the water - rich terrestrial planet is formed in the habitable zone .",
    "the structure , which is similar to that of solar system , may explain the results of disintegration of a terrestrial planet .",
    "most of the planetesimals among jupiter and saturn are scattered out of the planetary systems , and this migration caused by scattering @xcite or long - term orbital evolution can make planets capture at some mean motion resonance location .",
    "accretion could also happen a few times between two planets if the outer planet has a moderate mass , and the small terrestrial planet could survive at some resonances over @xmath1 yr time scale . structurally , saturn has little effect on the architecture inside jupiter , owing to its protection .",
