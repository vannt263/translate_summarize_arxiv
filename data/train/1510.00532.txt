    "this work is motivated by our earlier studies @xcite of physically observable properties of sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measures for 2d periodic lorentz gases ( sinai billiards ) with finite horizon , under small perturbations .",
    "sinai billiards and their perturbations have some rough singularities , but on the other hand they are strongly hyperbolic @xcite . precisely , their lyapunov exponents are non - zero and unstable vectors grow uniformly , at a rate @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the collision counter and @xmath2 the so called hyperbolicity constant . while sinai billiards are equilibrium systems preserving a smooth ( liouville ) measure , their perturbations are non - equilibrium systems whose natural invariant measures ( steady states ) are usually singular  they are srb measures .",
    "an srb measure is an ergodic invariant probability measure with absolutely continuous conditional distributions on unstable manifolds .",
    "srb measures are the only physically observable measures because their basins of attraction have positive lebesgue volume ; see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "perturbations of sinai billiards have unique srb measures , which are mixing and bernoulli @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we studied particularly interesting perturbations of sinai billiards where the particle moved under a small constant external field @xmath3 subject to a gaussian thermostat that kept its speed constant .",
    "for that model , the srb measure was constructed long ago @xcite , and it was proved that the ( global ) current @xmath4 of the particle satisfied @xmath5 , with the conductivity @xmath6 given by a standard green - kubo formula .    in that model , as well as in many other perturbations of sinai billiards , the srb measure is singular with respect to the lebesgue measure ( the hausdorff dimension of the srb measure is lower than that of the phase space @xcite ) . it is also argued in statistical mechanics that many multiparticle systems ( gases and fluids ) under external forces develop nonequilibrium steady states that behave as srb measures , in particular they are singular with respect to the phase volume ( this is known as `` chaotic hypothesis '' or `` axiom c '' @xcite ) .",
    "however one rarely observes the a steady state on the entire phase space to see its singularity .",
    "usually one observes selected variables , such as positions or velocities of certain moving particle(s ) . and",

    "in @xcite we showed that for the lorentz gas model three selected variables  the local particle density , the local current , and the angular velocity distribution have continuous densities .",
