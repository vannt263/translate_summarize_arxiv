    "discovery and study of higgs boson(s ) will be of primary importance at a next linear @xmath1collider .",
    "after discovery of a higgs ( h ) , the task will be to determine as precisely as possible and in a model - independent manner its fundamental couplings and total width . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "@xcite , the mass range from @xmath6100 gev to about 220 gev is favored by comparing precision electroweak data with sm predictions @xcite . for higgs masses at 120 and 140 gev detailed branching fraction measurement investigations can be found in e.g. refs.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume a higgs mass of 160 gev . for such masses",
    "the higgs decays mostly into ww@xmath3 whereas the @xmath4decay rate is stronly suppressed to few percent , opposite to the situation at smaller masses .",
    "additionally , at m@xmath7@xmath6 160 gev the background expected to contribute is more complicated since a mixture of ww ( where both w s are on - mass - shell ) and ww@xmath3 ( with one of the w s being off - mass - shell ) exists under the higgs , and due to detector resolution effects the observed width of the higgs boson is expected to be much larger than its natural total width . therefore finite w width effects have to be accounted for to enable accurate results .",
    "future linear @xmath1colliders operating in the 300 to 500 gev center - of - mass energy region are ideal machines to investigate the higgs sector in this mass regime : besides easily higgs discovery , all major decay modes can be explored .    in order to access the actual capability of an @xmath1collider to an analysis of the sm higgs boson",
    "it is extremely appealing to apply recently developed tools , thanks to the effort of several groups .",
    "in particular , we include in this study    * the full matrix elements for 4-particle final states beyond the usual approximation of computing higgsstrahlung production cross sections times branching fractions , using the program package comphep @xcite . in this way",
    ", all irreducible background and possible interferences between signal and background diagrams are accounted for .",
    "total and partial widths of the higgs boson corrected for qcd and qed loop contributions were implemented in comphep and cross - checked with the hdecay program @xcite . for parton shower and hadronization procedures as well as",
    "particle decays the pythia / jetset package @xcite has been interfaced ; * initial state qed @xcite and beamstrahlung for the tesla linear collider option @xcite ; * a detector response @xcite , with detector parameters as designed in a series of workshops for the linear @xmath1collider conceptual design report @xcite ; * all important reducible background reactions expected to contribute .",
    "the cm energy @xmath8 chosen for our study is 350 gev avoiding thus @xmath9pair production as background .",
    "although @xmath8 is not optimized for the best higgs production rate , it is a compromise between largest machine luminosity and sufficient event production for the process @xmath10 all the results presented are based on the high - luminosity option of the tesla machine @xcite with an instantaneous luminosity l = 3@xmath11@xmath12sec@xmath0 resulting to an accumulated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath0 within about two years of running .",
    "within the sm , the higgs boson with m@xmath7= 160 gev decays mostly to ww@xmath3 , in few percent of the time to zz@xmath3 and @xmath4and with a very small rate of about 0.5 @xmath13 to two photons .",
    "we consider only these decay modes as all others are expected to be more difficult to measure .",
    "the aim of this study is to provide the statistical uncertainties of the branching fractions for the decay modes mentioned by measuring @xmath14(@xmath1@xmath2hz ) @xmath15 bf(h @xmath2x ) @xmath15",
    "bf(z @xmath2y ) , @xmath16 , where s(b ) is the number of higgs ( background ) events observed in a small interval of the invariant mass x , centered around m@xmath7 . branching fraction errors of the higgs boson are then computed after convolution with the precision of the inclusive higgs production cross section @xmath14(hz ) of 2.8 % @xcite , @xcite .",
    "any z boson branching fractions errors are neglected .      for m@xmath7= 160 gev , the higgs decays mostly to ww@xmath3 , i.e. to a final state where one of the w s is on - mass - shell and the other is off - mass - shell . since we are interested to make a signal - to - background analysis as meaningful as possible we also consistently evaluate the background rates .",
    "most of this background comes from @xmath1@xmath2ww@xmath3z and wwz events and requires an accurate treatment of finite w width effects .",
    "therefore exact matrix elements are used to calculate by means of comphep the processes @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 with proper matching below and above the w pair threshold , and to generate unweigthed events .",
    "the final states @xmath20swz and c@xmath21wz were taken into account by doubling the number of events for reactions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , respectively . in order to avoid large not useful event samples",
    "the following cuts were applied to each final state particle during the generation stage :    * energy @xmath22 10 gev ; * polar angle @xmath23 ; * the invariant mass of any particle pairing m@xmath24 10 gev .    due to the large h @xmath2ww@xmath3 branching fraction and the luminosity assumed , thousands of signal events are expected . in the following",
    "we restrict our analysis to only z @xmath2@xmath1/ @xmath25 and w @xmath2@xmath26decays for reasons of simplicity .",
    "therefore , the signature we have to search for consists of four jets accompanied by two opposite - charged leptons .",
    "for each of the reactions ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) we apply a series of cuts to remove much of the reducible background and , if needed , further dedicated criteria are applied to suppress any remaining irreducible background .    in particular , the cuts we have adapted to select @xmath1@xmath2hz @xmath2ww@xmath3z events are    *",
    "the visible energy of the event , e@xmath27 , exceeds 200 gev ; * the total transverse energy of the event is larger than 40 gev ; * the total momentum along the beam direction is restricted to be within @xmath28 120 gev ; * the number of tracks per event is larger than 20 ; * out of all leptons found , at least one @xmath1or @xmath29pair has an invariant mass within m@xmath306 gev ; * for each jet we require * * e@xmath31 10 gev ; * * @xmath32cos @xmath33 0.85 ; * * number of particles /jet",

    "according to this procedure events were selected in which the higgs recoils against the z @xmath2@xmath39boson , with h @xmath2ww@xmath3 and w @xmath2@xmath26decays .",
    "reducible background events from @xmath40 @xmath41 which might mimic our topology and fulfil the selection criteria are small . as an example ,",
    "150.000 events of reaction ( 6 ) expected for 500 fb@xmath0 were processed and no entry appeared in the final ww@xmath42 mass distribution after all cuts .",
    "fig.[fig : fig_3023ww ] shows the ww@xmath42 mass spectrum for the surviving events .",
    "[ fig : fig_3023ww ]    a clear higgs signal is visible over a very small background which is mainly due to non - signal diagrams contributing in reactions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "we estimate a statistical error of 2.5 % for @xmath14(hz ) @xmath15 bf(h @xmath2ww@xmath3 ) @xmath15 bf(z @xmath2@xmath39 ) .",
    "after convolution with the error of @xmath14(hz ) the precision for bf(h @xmath2ww@xmath3 ) is found to be @xmath283.5 % .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xmath1@xmath2hz @xmath2(zz@xmath3 ) ( @xmath39 ) @xmath24 jets + @xmath1/@xmath29events , which have the same signature and could contribute to the final ww@xmath42 mass spectrum , were subtracted from the distribution in fig.1 .",
    "information for the h @xmath2zz@xmath3 branching fraction can be obtained either from the inclusive higgs production cross section @xmath14(hz ) which is proportional to the zzh coupling - squared or from studies of zz@xmath3 mass distributions .",
    "the latter spectra , obtained from the reaction @xmath43 contribute to four event topologies depending on the z decay modes selected :    * 6-jet events ; * 4-jet plus two opposite - charged lepton events ; * 2-jet plus two pairs of opposite - charged lepton events ; * three pairs of opposite - charged lepton events .    since large event rates are expected from the background reaction @xmath1@xmath2wwz @xmath26 jets and the signal process @xmath1@xmath2hz @xmath2ww@xmath3z",
    "@xmath26 jets , the 6-jet topology has been discarded from our study . also the three lepton pair topology had been omitted due to its very small event rate .",
    "we first consider the 2-jet 4-lepton topology . by means of comphep the following reactions @xmath44",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 were generated and properly weighted to account for @xmath47 , @xmath48and @xmath4contributions in reactions ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "the two z bosons ( and for reaction ( 10 ) , two z s out of the three ) are allowed to decay to electron respectively muon pairs . after event reconstruction",
    "we require besides some more general cuts    * only @xmath1/@xmath29 , @xmath1/@xmath1or @xmath29/@xmath29lepton combinations in the final state ; * @xmath32cos @xmath49 0.95 for each lepton ; * there exists at least one lepton pair * * with m@xmath50 = m@xmath306 gev ; * * e@xmath51 + e@xmath52 125 gev ; * * which recoils against the ( @xmath26@xmath39 ) system with an invariant mass of less than 220 gev ; * two and only two jets in the final state , after excluding the four leptons from the jet finder ; * for each jet we demand * * e@xmath31 10 gev ; * * @xmath32cos @xmath53 0.9 , * * number of particles / jet @xmath34 4 ; * * angle ( jet@xmath54 , jet@xmath55 ) @xmath22 20@xmath56 .",

    "deviations of bf(h @xmath2@xmath5 ) measurements from the sm expectations would be of great importance .",
    "in particular , by virtue of the fact that the coupling h @xmath2@xmath5arises from charged loops , large deviations from the sm value due to new particles ( e.g. a fourth generation , supersymmetry ) are possible . measuring bf(h",

    "as can be seen , the background in the higgs region is overwhelming .",

    "a multidimensional analysis based on a likelihood estimator which includes 16 variables had not improved the results obtained . 0.92 .",
    "] whether the addition of h @xmath2@xmath5fusion events , with an about four times less production cross section , would significantly alter our conclusion remains to be studied in detail .",
    "besides the measurements of the higgs branching fractions to fermions and bosons - precisely as possible and independent of any model or assumptions - the measurement of its total width is an important concern .",
    "the procedure for ascertaining this quantity is based on the precisions for bf(h @xmath2zz@xmath3 ) of 14.5 % and the inclusive higgsstrahlung cross section of 2.8 % . from",
    "that the error of the total higgs width is calculated to @xmath78(h ) = @xmath2815 % which is mainly governed by the uncertainty of bf(h @xmath2zz@xmath3 ) .",
    "it is worthwile to remind that for m@xmath61 of about 120 gev the suggestion is @xcite to measure the h @xmath2@xmath5 partial width by means of a @xmath5collider,@xmath5partial width itself stands out as an observable of considerably physical importance .",
    "recent studies @xcite indicate that @xmath5collisions allow for a @xmath65 % error determination of @xmath79(h @xmath2@xmath5 ) , for m@xmath61 = 160 gev . ] and if combined with bf(h @xmath2@xmath5 ) and bf(h @xmath2@xmath4 ) measurements from @xmath1collisions , @xmath77(h ) can be calculated .",
    "an analogous procedure for a 160 gev higgs seems to be prevented as long as an acceptable measurement fails for bf(h @xmath2@xmath5 ) , see sect.2.4 .",
