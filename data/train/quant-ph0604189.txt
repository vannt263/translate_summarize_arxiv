    "quantum measurement is a link between quantum and classical world . the measurement influence the system that is being measured by changing it to one of the states that measurement apparatus can recognize .",
    "neither schrdinger equation , nor any relativistic description of quantum mechanics , says anything about the dynamics of measurement .",
    "fortunately , quantum theory can predict the probabilities of measurement outcomes . for our purpose",
    "that is enough to say something about the physics behind .",
    "despite the fact that quantum measurement is probabilistic and `` invasive '' process it can be found very useful in some interesting and common ( i.e. not only laboratory ) applications .",
    "for example it allows us to gain some knowledge on the system being measured .",
    "if someone prepares one of the two known orthogonal quantum states and asks us what the state is .",
    "we can answer his question by performing appropriate measurement . on the other hand , destructive property of measurement",
    "makes quantum cryptography secure @xcite . if somebody wants to get information about the quantum system he has to `` touch '' it and therefore change it .",
    "it means that when someone eavesdrops he leaves `` fingerprints '' behind him which can be used in the future to detect his presence .",
    "one often assumes that quantum measurement ( the so called von neumann measurement ) is usually represented by @xmath0 operators where @xmath1 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "these operators satisfy the following coditions : @xmath2 and the probability of obtaining during the measurement the result @xmath3 is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the state of the quantum system on which the measurement is performed .",
    "it has been shown however , that there are more possible measurement scenarios than von neumann orthogonal projective measurements @xcite .",
    "this type of measurements are called povm ( positive operator valued measure ) .",
    "the three conditions on povm elements @xmath6 appeared to be too much . only two first are necessary to implement any physical measurement .",
    "it may look strange , because we get use to think of the measurement as of something classical and when we say classical we usually think of some _ orthogonal _ states .",
    "the reason why we can have this counterintuitive operators is that we can add some ancillary system @xmath7 then allow it to interact in a prescribed way with our system @xmath8 and finally we perform the collective measurement on both systems @xcite . getting rid of the last condition gives us a whole bunch of new possibilities .",
    "first of all , we are no longer restricted to only @xmath9 projective measurement operators .",
    "we can have as many operators as we want as long as they fulfill condition ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the first one simply says that the probability of outcome can not be negative .",
    "the second one says that the total probability has to sum up to one .",
    "this nonorthogonality of measurement operators allows us to perform probabilistic unambiguous discrimination of quantum states - i.e. we can distinguish , with probability less than one , some quantum states which are in general nonorthogonal @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give simple graphical description of povm measurements performed on two level quantum systems ( qubits ) by representing the povm elements as vectors inside the bloch sphere .",
    "we show that using this formalism one can easily calculate the best strategy for error - free state discrimination of pure states .",
    "let us consider two restrictions ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) on povm elements .",
    "first of all , they have to be positive and therefore hermitian . as a matter of fact , there are some positive and hermitian operators that we know very well - density matrices that describe quantum states . the density matrix posses one feature that is not necessary for the povm operators - its diagonal values have to sum up to one . taking this into account ,",
    "we may write any povm operator in the following form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is some quantum state in the hilbert space of the system we want to measure and @xmath12 is real positive constant .    for two level systems one can visualize density matrix as a vector @xmath13 on or inside the bloch sphere .",
    "we use the standard formulae @xcite to obtain vector coordinates for the bloch vector @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the @xmath17-th pauli spin matrix .",
    "on the other hand we are able to write any density matrix in the form @xmath18 the vector @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are unit vectors .    at this point",
    "we should take a closer look at the density matrix @xmath11 that builds operator @xmath23 .",
    "if it is a mixed state we can always decompose it into two ( for the two dimensional hilbert space ) orthogonal pure states .",
    "the decomposition goes as follows : for the mixed state @xmath24 and therefore @xmath25 where @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the unit vector .",
    "this can be written as @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 it is easy to see that @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the graphical representation ( see fig.[f1 ] ) is very simple    @xmath35    one should notice that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are eigenvalues of @xmath11 @xmath38 but , using this decomposition we split one povm _ mixed _",
    "operator @xmath6 into two _ pure _ operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 the probability that during the measurement of state @xmath5 the outcome is @xmath3 is given by @xmath42 for the mixed operator @xmath6 , we see that @xmath43 from now we will consider only operators which are of rank one i.e. are proportional to pure states .",
    "we do not lose generality because if the operator is of rank two i.e is proportional to mixed state we can decompose it into two operators of rank one , calculate two probabilities and then add them .",
    "we will visualize povm as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is unit vector because @xmath11 is pure state , and quantum states @xmath5 as @xmath46 note , that for pure povm matrix @xmath11 the constant @xmath12 plays the role of the length of @xmath47 .    up to now",
    ", we have introduced vectors .",
    "right now we will show how to calculate probabilities of measurement outcome using the scalar product @xmath48 . from ( [ e8 ] ) , ( [ e17 ] ) and ( [ e18 ] ) we know that @xmath49 @xmath50 here , it is worth to see the difference between operators @xmath6 and quantum states .",
    "even if two vectors may look the same in the bloch sphere picture , they will look different in the notation ( [ e19 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) . substituting ( [ e19 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) into ( [ e15 ] ) one obtains @xmath51 because only @xmath52 and @xmath53 have nonzero sum of diagonal elements and contribute to trace",
    ".    moreover , for pure operators @xmath6 and pure states @xmath5 the probability takes the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath56 .",
    "next , we will find the restriction on povm vectors @xmath47 .",
    "if we sum up all of them and take into account ( [ e2 ] ) we will obtain @xmath57 the sum of all vectors has to give zero .",
    "this is also visible in both cases in the fig.[f2 ] .",
    "now , let us say something about @xmath12 s  the lengths of the vectors @xmath58 s .",
    "we can derive one condition that they have to follow by calculating the trace of ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "trace of the identity operator is equal to the dimension of the hilbert space - @xmath59 .",
    "the left hand side gives @xmath60 so our condition for lengths @xmath12 s is @xmath61 therefore we get two conditions for the vectors representing povm @xmath62",
    "imagine that somebody sends us one of two pure states @xmath63 or @xmath64 with the same probability @xmath65 .",
    "we know what these states are , but we do not know which state the sender has chosen .",
    "are we able to tell whether we received @xmath63 or @xmath64 ?",
    "this case was considered earlier by @xcite , but we will solve it in a graphical way .",
    "it seems that if those states are orthogonal we can do it easily , because this turns out to be purely classical case ( even if sometimes the basis differs from @xmath66 ) .",
    "we simply perform von neumann projective measurement ( see fig.[f2 ] top ) .    what happens if @xmath63 and @xmath64 are not orthogonal ?",
    "now , von neumann measurement is not enough .",
    "although we might set two measurement vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 of length one ( @xmath69 ) that are parallel ( in the bloch sphere picture ) to one of the states , the other state will be lying on the bloch sphere out of the line given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it means , that it may be detected by both @xmath70 and @xmath71 and therefore , our answers about identity of the state may be wrong .",
    "let us take @xmath72 .",
    "in order to be more convincing we derive the probability of outcome @xmath6 while measuring the state @xmath63 .",
    "this probability is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the angle between the state vector @xmath75 and @xmath47 as before .",
    "the vector @xmath75 is lying out of the line given by @xmath47 , so @xmath74 is neither zero nor @xmath76 and thus we have that both probabilities @xmath77 and @xmath78 are nonzero .",
    "the consequences are following . if the outcome of the measurement is @xmath79 , we know that the only possibility is that the state was @xmath63 . if the outcome is @xmath80 we know that it probably was @xmath64 , but there is some chance that it might have been @xmath63 , so we are not able to distinguish both states without an error .",
    "povm gives us the possibility of error - free discrimination of quantum states .",
    "what we want to obtain is to find two operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 that have the following property .",
    "@xmath70 is _ sometimes _ measured when the first state was sent and is never measured when the second state was sent .",
    "@xmath71 works in the opposite way .",
    "it means , we are looking for the vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 that are antiparallel to the vectors representing the first and the second state @xmath81    in order to satisfy ( [ e26 ] ) we need to introduce the third vector .",
    "we want _ `` sometimes '' _ to happen quite often , that is why we need @xmath82 an @xmath83 to be as large as possible .",
    "moreover , we have no bias in favor of any of the states so we put @xmath84 the probability of successful state discrimination is @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the equality sign between two probabilities holds since ( [ e29]-[e31 ] ) impose symmetry on states and measurement vectors @xmath88 .",
    "because of symmetry and condition ( [ e26 ] ) , the third povm has to point exactly in between @xmath89 and @xmath75 giving @xmath90 moreover , because of condition ( [ e27 ] ) we know that @xmath91 the reason why we put quotation sign in the subscript of the third povm is that it gives completely no information about which state was sent since @xmath92    let us write explicit formula for ( [ e32 ] ) keeping in mind that @xmath6 s are _ pure _ operators and the angle between @xmath89 and @xmath75 is @xmath93 ( see fig.[f3 ] ) @xmath94 then , we go back to ( [ e33 ] ) and ( [ e34 ] ) ( see also fig.[f4 ] ) and obtain @xmath95 we find that @xmath96 and putting this into ( [ e36 ] ) we get the final formula for the probability of successful state discrimination @xmath97 moreover , this is the highest possible probability of success because we used as few povm s as possible maximizing their length @xmath98 .",
    "we presented simple and intuitive graphical interpretation of generalized quantum measurements .",
    "we have shown that using this method one can easily calculate the best strategy for error - free discrimination of two quantum pure states . although we have not considered either more than two quantum states or nonuniform probability distribution of states ( i.e. some states are more likely to appear than other states ) , we believe that this method could be applied as well to such cases .      c. h. bennett and g. brassard , proceedings of ieee international conference on computers , systems and signal processing , 175 - 179 , ieee , new york , 1984 a. peres , _ quantum theory : concepts and methods _ , kluwer , dordrecht , 1993 . c. w. helstrom , _ quantum detection and estimation the- ory _ , academic , new york , 1976 . m. a. neumark , dokl . acad .",
