    "the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in cooling flow ( cf ) clusters and groups of galaxies is heated by a negative feedback mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) , mostly driven by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) jets that inflate x - ray deficient cavities ( bubbles ; see , e.g. , @xcite for recent papers and references therein ) .",
    "examples of bubbles include abell 2052 @xcite , ngc 6338 @xcite , ngc 5044 @xcite , hcg 62 @xcite , hydra a @xcite , ngc 5846 @xcite ngc 5813 @xcite , a 2597 @xcite , abell 4059 @xcite , ngc 4636 @xcite , ngc 5044 @xcite , and rbs 797 @xcite .",
    "wide bubbles very close to the origin of the jets ( the agn ) , e.g. , as in abell 2052 , that are termed ` fat bubbles ' , can be inflated by jets that do not penetrate through the icm .",
    "instead , they deposit their energy relatively close to their origin and inflate the fat bubbles .",
    "slow massive wide ( smw ) jets can inflate the fat bubbles that are observed in many cfs , in clusters , groups of galaxies , and in elliptical galaxies @xcite . the same basic physics that prevents wide jets from penetrating through the icm holds for precessing jets @xcite , or a relative motion of the jets to the medium @xcite . in the present study we will inflate bubbles by smw jets , but our results hold for bubbles inflated by precessing jets or a relative motion of the icm as well .",
    "if the jets penetrate to a too large distance , then no bubbles are formed , while in intermediate cases elongated and/or detached from the center bubbles are formed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "vortices inside the bubbles and in their surroundings play major roles in the formation of bubbles , their evolution , and their interaction with the icm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find that a turbulent vortex trails each cavity , and that this vortex contains a significant quantity of entrained and uplifted material ( also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find in their 2.5d numerical simulations that vortices inside bubbles can stabilize them against the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability and can suppress the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability on the surface of each bubble .",
    "jet - excited shocks that interact with older bubbles can excite vortices that dissipate energy to the icm @xcite .",
    "the vortices cause semi - periodic changes in the bubble properties , such as its boundary .",
    "this can lead a single bubble to excite several sound waves @xcite , and cause a single jet episode to inflate a chain of bubbles @xcite . in the present study we further explore the role of vortices in the interaction of the jets and bubbles with the icm .",
    "we concentrate on gas near the equatorial plane , i.e. , icm gas that does not reside along the jets expansion trajectory .",
    "the heating of the gas perpendicular to the jets axis need not be @xmath7 efficient , as observations show that heating does not completely offset cooling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a _ moderate cf _ exists @xcite . _",
    "moderate _ implies here that the mass cooling rate to low temperatures is much lower than the cooling rate expected without heating , but it is much larger than the accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of the cluster .",
    "the cooling mass is either forming stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , forming cold clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , accreted by the smbh to maintain the cold feedback mechanism @xcite , or is expelled back to the icm and heated , when it is shocked or mixed with the hot jets material .    in the present paper",
    "we study the heating and expelling process of gas residing near the equatorial plane . by running cylindrically symmetric hydrodynamical simulations with the pluto code ( section [ sec : numerical ] )",
    "we study the flow structure ( section [ sec : flow ] ) .",
    "we then examine the degree of mixing and dredge - up of gas from the equatorial plane vicinity ( section [ sec : mixing ] ) , and the heating processes ( section [ sec : heating ] ) .",
    "our short summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the simulations were performed using the pluto code @xcite .",
    "we use spherical coordinates in 3d , but with an imposed azimuthal symmetry around the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) axis .",
    "namely , a 2.5d grid where only the dependence on the @xmath10 coordinates is calculated .",
    "we will present the results in a plane @xmath11constant , the meridional plane , which we take to be the @xmath12 plane , where @xmath13 is in the equatorial plane and @xmath9 is along the symmetry axis .",
    "the grid radial and azimuthal domains are @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we focus on the relevant inner domain of @xmath16 ; the large outer radius ensures that there are no boundary effects , at a low computational cost thanks to a radially stretching grid .    on the @xmath17 inner boundary",
    "we enforce a jet outflow between angles @xmath18 for a limited time , and reflective boundary conditions in the angular zone @xmath19 . in the simulations presented here",
    "the two jets power is @xmath20 , their initial velocity is @xmath21 , and mass loss rate into the two jets is @xmath22 .",
    "such massive wide sub - relativistic outflows are supported by recent observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at @xmath23",
    "we turn the jet off , and apply reflective boundary conditions on the entire inner sphere .",
    "we set reflective boundary conditions on the boundaries @xmath8 ( @xmath9 axis ) and @xmath24 ( the equatorial plane ) .",
    "the latter boundary condition mimics a symmetric opposite jet .",
    "the initial density profile has a spherical symmetry , with a profile of the form ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath25 ^{-\\frac{3}{4}}. \\label{eq : rho1}\\ ] ] we take here @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we start the simulation with an isothermal sphere at temperature @xmath28 , so that the pressure profile is proportional to the density profile @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the sound speed , with symbols having their usual meaning , and @xmath31 .",
    "radiative cooling is included by using table 6 from @xcite .",
    "we use a time invariable spherical gravity field calculated from the hydrostatic equilibrium at @xmath32 @xmath33^{-1}. \\label{eq : gravity1}\\ ] ]    to quantitatively analyze the thermal evolution of the icm we marked several regions of the initial ambient gas in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "each such region is actually a torus due to our 2.5d grid .",
    "these are called the _ traced",
    "regions_. the tracing is done by defining artificial flow quantities called tracers in the pluto code @xcite , that are frozen - in to the flow . at @xmath32",
    "the tracer of the region centered at @xmath34 and having a radius of @xmath35 is set to @xmath36 .",
    "mixing of the traced gas with the icm or the jet s material changes the tracer to values below @xmath37 .",
    "since this quantity is advected with mass , the summation over all zones @xmath3 of mass multiplied by tracer value @xmath38 is constant with time .",
    "this was verified in the post - simulation analysis . using these tracers we define the average property q of the traced gas that was centered on @xmath34 at @xmath32 @xmath39 where @xmath40 can be the temperature , the pressure , or the position of the traced gas , i.e. , its center of mass .",
    "in figure [ fig : presentation ] we show the density ( left ) and temperature ( right ) maps at the end of the jet s injection phase ( @xmath23 ) . in this simulation",
    "the combined two jets ( here we simulate only one jet ) power is @xmath20 , their initial velocity is @xmath21 , and mass loss rate into the two jets is @xmath22 . clearly identified in the figure are the forward shock running into the icm , multiple sound waves ( clearly seen in the velocity map presented in figure [ fig : velocity2 ] ) , and the reverse shock , where the jet is shocked .",
    "the shocked jet material forms a hot low density bubble , of size @xmath0 at @xmath23 .",
    "the bubble is the region of low density ( dark blue and light blue ) in figure [ fig : presentation ] ( left ) , corresponding to the hot regions ( orange , red and yellow ) in figure [ fig : presentation ] ( right ) .",
    "the bubble obtained here is similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "such bubbles are observed as x - ray deficient bubbles ( cavities )",
    ". also marked is the contact discontinuity separating the shocked jet s material from the shocked icm gas . at later times mixing prevails and the contact discontinuity can not be identified ( see next section ) .",
    "the low post - shock velocity of @xmath41 in the equatorial plane is because the forward shock in the equatorial plane at @xmath42 is very weak , having a mach number of @xmath43 .    -1.0 cm    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we now turn to the mixing of gas perpendicular to the jets axis . at early times ( here @xmath44 )",
    "the traced region tr31 has been pushed by the forward shock and the pressure of the shocked jet s material , while still staying intact . at later times",
    "the tr31 initial morphology ( cross section in the @xmath45 plane ) is violently disrupted by the turbulence ( vortices ) of the shocked jet and icm gas . by @xmath46 the original tr31 gas",
    "is heavily mixed with the hot shocked gas , and its temperature increases as we show in the next section .",
    "another effect of the jets on the icm is the displacement of the icm .",
    "we follow the center of mass of a tracer by taking the quantity @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq : tracers1 ] ) to be the location of the material @xmath48 . in figure",
    "[ fig : rtracers ] we present the distance @xmath49 from the center of the centers of mass of four tracers .",
    "all tracers are pushed outward at early time as the forward shock passes through them .",
    "later they can fall back intact , as tr91 does , or be completely mixed , a process that can cause the center of mass distance from the center to increase or decrease several times .",
    "the mixing of material from different regions driven by vortices may affect the metallicity gradient in the icm . in order to properly examine this ,",
    "the simulations need to include realistic star formation and metal enrichment due to it , and more important , to include metallicity - dependent cooling .",
    "the reason for the latter is that higher metallicity regions will in general cool faster and fall back to the center .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work , and we leave it for a future work .",
    "to better understand the heating processes of the icm gas residing near the equatorial plane we follow the variation of some thermodynamic quantities of several traced regions . in figure",
    "[ fig : figtr31 ] we present the relative changes of the average pressure , temperature , location , entropy , and the mixing degree of tr31 ; tr31 is a traced region whose cross section in the @xmath50 at @xmath32 is a circle of radius @xmath35 centered on @xmath51 .",
    "the average pressure , temperature , and location are calculated by equation ( [ eq : tracers1 ] ) , and @xmath52 .",
    "the entropy ( per particle ) is calculated from the sackur - tetrode equation , using the average temperature and average density of the tracer .",
    "also shown is the degree of mixing , which is defined using equation ( [ eq : tracers1 ] ) , so that @xmath53    as can be seen in figure [ fig : figtr31 ] , initially @xmath36 , which means there is no mixing .",
    "when the shock passes through the region , there is a slight decrease in @xmath54 .",
    "this is a numerical effect - as the region shifts its location , the zones on the circumference appear to be mixed , although the region stays intact . at later times the value of @xmath54 further decreases due to mixing .",
    "the main conclusion from figure [ fig : figtr31 ] is that the heating is due to mixing .",
    "the forward shock that runs through the icm has no significant lasting influence .",
    "the forward shock hits tr31 at @xmath55 , compresses it and heats it .",
    "however , the gas re - expands , and at @xmath56 its temperature returns to its original value .",
    "its entropy is somewhat higher than its original value , but not by much ( see eq . 3.7 in @xcite ) . a significant heating of the tr31 gas starts at @xmath57 when the degree of mixing with hot gas increases ( as seen by the decreasing value of @xmath54 ) .",
    "the mixing is with hot shocked jets and icm gas ; the icm and the jet materials are already mixed as can be seen in figure [ fig : mixing1 ] . at @xmath58 the temperature drops because mixing with cooler icm medium starts to be more important than mixing with hot shocked jet s gas . in figure",
    "[ fig : figcompare31 ] the evolutions of the entropy ( left ) and temperature ( right ) of tr31 with jet and radiative cooling included ( the standard run ) are compared to cases where either the jet or radiative cooling are not included . because of the stochastic nature of the mixing process , small differences in the initial conditions can lead to local differences in the thermal evolution .",
    "the differences at early times between the standard simulation and the one with no radiative cooling is due to this stochastic behavior . at late times",
    "the tracer tr31 in the standard simulation is cooler than the case with no radiative cooling .",
    "figure [ fig : figtr91 ] is similar to figure [ fig : figcompare31 ] but for tracer tr91 and only for the temperature .",
    "this tracer stays intact till the end of the simulation ( @xmath59 ) , although it loses its circular cross section .",
    "it suffers a small degree of mixing , which accounts for it being somewhat hotter at late times than the case where there is no jet .",
    "the rapid temperature rises of tr91 are due to the forward shock and sound waves that cross the tr91 material .",
    "after the passage of each sound wave the tr91 gas cools back .",
    "the average temperature of the tr91 gas is below its initial temperature , but somewhat above the case without jet activity .",
    "this shows that the efficiency of heating decreases further away from the center .",
    "the heating of this region will either take place if the jets of the next episode will have a different direction , such that tr91 will be closer to the jets axis , or if the next activity episode will occur after @xmath60 . in this latter possibility",
    "the material of tr91 will be closer to the center ( see figure [ fig : rtracers ] ) , and will be more likely to be mixed with the hot bubble material . at @xmath59",
    "the center of mass of tr91 is at a distance of @xmath61 from the center ( fig . [",
    "fig : rtracers ] ) , and falling slowly inward at a velocity of @xmath62 . at this rate , by @xmath63 tr91 will be close to where tr60 was initially , close enough to the center to be heated by mixing ( see below ) .",
    "in any case , in the cold feedback mechanism some of the gas does cool , falls inward and feeds the agn .",
    "so there is no need for 100% heating efficiency .",
    "figures [ fig : ttracers ] and [ fig : stracers ] depict the time evolution of the average temperature and entropy of several traced regions .",
    "all regions undergo shock heating early on , with diminishing shock heating as the region is further away from the center and at a larger angle to the jets direction .",
    "however , shortly afterwards the regions cool down due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "subsequent heating is not by shocks , but by mixing of the traced region material with hot material from the shocked jet and icm .",
    "mixing is due to the vortices and turbulent nature of the jet - icm interaction process .",
    "we used the pluto hydrodynamic code @xcite to conduct 2.5d hydrodynamic simulations , i.e. , the flow is 3d but with an imposed azimuthal symmetry around the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) axis , to study the heating of gas perpendicular to the jets axis .",
    "only one side of the equatorial plane was simulated , and the jet was active for a time period of @xmath1 .",
    "we marked several intra - cluster medium ( icm ) regions , the traced regions , and followed the evolution of their averaged thermodynamic variables .",
    "each traced regions has an initial circular cross section with radius of @xmath35 in the meridional plane ( @xmath45 ) , i.e. , it is a torus in 3d . at late times the traced region",
    "are vigorously mixed with the icm and lose their intact structure .",
    "we reproduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : presentation ] ) the formation of a fat bubble by a slow massive wide ( smw ) jet @xcite , and the formation of multiple sound waves with a single jet activity episode @xcite .",
    "vortices play major roles in the structure of evolution bubbles , as is evident also from figures [ fig : evolution ] and [ fig : velocity ] . in the present paper we found that vortices play a major role in setting a complex flow structure that leads to a very efficient mixing of the high entropy shocked jet gas with the icm . as evident from figure [ fig : mixing1 ] the mixing is very efficient both along the jet s expansion cone ( white contours ) and near the equatorial plane ( black contours ) .",
    "the icm gas along the jet s cone is dredge up to large distances , while the material near the equatorial plane spreads and mixes in a large volume in the inner region .",
    "our main results are summarized in figures [ fig : figtr31 ] and [ fig : figtr91 ] .",
    "these are that ( @xmath3 ) the heating is very efficient near the equatorial plane up to a distance of @xmath0 , ( @xmath4 ) the heating by the forward shock wave is very small , and ( @xmath5 ) that the main heating is caused by mixing ; mixing is depicted by decreasing value of @xmath54 .",
    "these are further demonstrated in figure [ fig : figcompare31 ] , where the standard run is compared with similar simulations but without either radiative cooling or without a jet .",
    "the mixing and heating near the equatorial plane continues to counter radiative cooling for times of @xmath2 after the jets have ceased to exist .",
    "our results further have the following implications .",
    "( 1 ) the complex mixing will entangle magnetic field lines and will suppress any global heat conduction in the icm near the center .",
    "namely , the presence of bubbles in cooling flows implies that heating the inner region by heat conduction is prohibited .",
    "( 2 ) the same entanglement process mixes the magnetic fields of the icm and the shocked jets material .",
    "this will lead to reconnection of the magnetic field lines , hence will allow for local heat conduction between the mixed icm and jets gas .",
    "we emphasize the necessity to distinguish between the efficient process of local heat conduction ( scales of @xmath64 ) as opposed to the inefficient global ( scales of @xmath65 ) heat conduction process ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) the most crucial region for heating in cooling flows is the inner @xmath0 .",
    "our results imply that heating by jets that inflate bubble is very efficient in this inner region in all directions , along and perpendicular to the jets axis .",
    "( 4 ) the vigorous mixing implies that the region within few@xmath66 is multi - phase .",
    "some small regions will be the coolest ones .",
    "if they are not heated by another jet activity episode , they will cool , flow inward , and feed the agn .",
    "our results therefore supply further support to the cold feedback mechanism as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the cold feedback mechanism has been strengthened recently by observations of cold gas and by more detailed studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the same feedback mechanism that works in group and cluster cooling flows can be the feedback mechanism during galaxy formation if the ism was hot , i.e. , at about the virial temperature there .",
    "namely , a cooling flow might have existed during galaxy formation periods @xcite .",
    "we note though that at the time of galaxy formation the volume outer to the inner @xmath0 contains much less mass and its pressure is much lower than the values simulated here .",
    "this implies the following .",
    "all traced regions here are accelerated by the forward shock to velocities of @xmath67 , and can be further pushed out by the shocked jets gas .",
    "however , they slow down because of the interaction with the icm further out , as evident from figure [ fig : rtracers ] . during galaxy formation ,",
    "on the other hand , this interaction can expel a large fraction of the gas outward .",
    "the study of this type of interaction during galaxy formation is a subject of a future paper ."
