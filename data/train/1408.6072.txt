    "the simpest version of an rf squid consists of a superconducting ring interrupted by a josephson junction @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) ; that device is a highly nonlinear resonator with a strong response to applied magnetic fields .",
    "squid metamaterials exhibit peculiar magnetic properties including negative diamagnetic permeability that were predicted both for the quantum @xcite and the classical @xcite regime .",
    "the applied alternating fields induce ( super)currents in the squid rings , coupling them together through dipole - dipole magnetic forces ; although weak due to its magnetic nature , that interaction couples the squids non - locally since it falls - off as the inverse cube of their center - to - center distance .",
    "the study of networks of interacting nonlinear elements pervades all of science , from neurobiology to statistical physics , often revealing remarkable aspects of collective behaviour @xcite .",
    "the effect of non - local interactions , which constitutes the `` dark corner '' of nonlinear dynamics , has been extensively investigated in the last decade and has unveiled collective dynamic effects such as synchronization @xcite , pattern formation @xcite , and turing instabilities @xcite .",
    "recently , a state with a counter - intuitive structure , usually referred to as a _",
    "`` chimera state '' _ , was discovered in numerical simulations of non - locally coupled oscillator arrays @xcite . since then , an intense theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite activity has been initiated .",
    "a _ `` chimera state '' _ is characterized by the coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous clusters ( subgroups ) of oscillators , even though they are coupled symmetrically and they are identical @xcite . in the present work",
    ", it is demonstrated numerically that this remarkable collective dynamic behaviour emerges in squid metamaterials which are driven by an alternating magnetic field in the presence of weak dissipation .",
    "the squid metamaterial model which has been used previously in the weak and local coupling regime , in which each squid is only coupled to its nearest neighbors , for the investigation of intrinsic localization and tuneability effects @xcite , is being extended to account for non - local magnetic interactions .",
    "chimera states with very long life - times are obtained by initializing randomly the fluxes threading the squid rings ; the subsequent dynamic evolution yields spontaneous formation of clusters of squids that exhibit synchronous and asynchronous flux oscillations for sufficiently strong initial flux excitations .",
    "their existence requires multistability of the individual squids at frequencies in the region around that of the driving field .",
    "individual squid states with high current amplitude may customarily be reached from basins of attraction which are much smaller than those of the states with low current amplitude .",
    "the number of possible states in a squid metamaterial is not merely the sum of the combinations of individual squid states , since their collective behavior may provide many more possibilities .",
    "chimera states are such an example , where qualitatively distinct and counter - intuitive states emerge from collective dynamics .",
    "although chimera states are generally regarded to be metastable @xcite , or even chaotic transients @xcite , there are also examples where they are at the global minimum of a system in thermal equilibrium , as has been predicted for ising spins @xcite .",
    "the level of synchronization and metastability of the chimera states can be however quantified by several measures @xcite .",
    "many different types of non - local interactions have been employed in the literature , often exponentially decaying , that allow a particular system to reach a chimera state .",
    "importantly , chimera states in globally coupled systems that have been recently demonstrated @xcite , may lead to a revision of their existence criteria .",
    "the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between squids , considered here , although it is still short - ranged @xcite , it falls - off much slower than the exponentially decaying one and it is capable of rendering the system able to support chimera states .    in the next section ,",
    "the non - locally coupled squid metamaterial model is presented , and the linear frequency dispersion is obtained . in the same section , the complex synchronization ( kuramoto - type ) parameter is defined along with a measure of metastability . in section iii , the numerically obtained spatiotemporal evolution of several chimera states are shown , and compared with those of the corresponding locally coupled squid metamaterial . the magnitude of the synchronization parameter is monitored in time both for the non - locally and the locally coupled squid metamaterials , and the differences are indicated .",

    "note that the comparison of the parameters used in the simulations of the one - dimensional squid metamaterial are compared with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the experiments have been performed on two - dimensional arrays , merely to show that these are realistic . in this work , we do not attempt to simulate a particular squid metamaterial .",
    "moreover , the dimensionality of the system does not affect significantly the estimation of the parameters that are necessary for the simulations , since they can be estimated either by the individual squid properties ( i.e. , @xmath75 , @xmath73 ) or by a pair of squids ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "chimera states are very sensitive to slight changes of the model parameters , the parameters of the driving field , as well as the integration parameters , e.g. , the value of the time - step , and there is indeed a large number of such states available in a squid metamaterial .",
    "the chosen time - step @xmath76 , in particular , is a typical choice for systems of nonlinear oscillators that gives reliable results .",
    "decreasing of the time - step ( i.e. , to @xmath77 ) leads the squid metamaterial to a different chimera state due to their high metastability ; that state may be either more or less synchronized than the previous one , depending on the other parameters .",
    "for the chosen parameters , the system reaches spontaneously dynamical states where synchronous ( coherent ) and asynchronous ( incoherent ) clusters of squids coexist , for most of the initial flux configurations with @xmath78 . a typical spatiotemporal flux pattern obtained after @xmath79 time units ( t.u . ) of integration",

    "note that since the squid metamaterial is driven at a particular frequency @xmath82 , there can be no net frequency drift as in phase oscillators @xcite ; instead , the period of each squid in the asynchronous cluster fluctuates around that of the driver , @xmath83 .    in figs .",

    "( green arrow ) . in the corresponding time - dependent magnitudes of the synchronization parameter averaged over the driving period @xmath83 , @xmath86 ,",
    "those sudden expansions make themselves apparent as abrupt changes towards lower synchronization levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) .",
    "by changing the coupling between the squids from non - local to local , i.e. , by taking into account the coupling of each squid only to its nearest - neighbours , we obtain the corresponding patterns and @xmath86s shown in fig .",
    "the differences in the patterns of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] are merely due to the change of the coupling from non - local to local . as can be observed in figs .",

    "the different states occupied by the squids in the metamaterial are close to one of the available stable states of individual squids .",

    "[ fig4]c and [ fig5]c is very illuminating : the curves obtained for non - locally coupled squids exhibit a much lower degree of synchronization than the corresponding ones for locally coupled squids ( e.g. for the blue curves , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for non - local and local coupling , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations in time are much stronger in the former case , due to the existence of asynchronous cluster(s ) . for zero initial conditions , both",

[ fig5]a and [ fig5]b ) . in the non - locally coupled squid metamaterial , to the contrary , the additional coupling provided by the second - nearest , third - nearest , etc . , neighbors , is capable of keeping the squids close to these high - flux - amplitude states for long time - intervals .     +    the spatial profiles of @xmath80 and the time - derivatives of the fluxes averaged over @xmath83 , @xmath89 , at the end of the integration time ( @xmath90 t.u . ) of fig .",

    "notably , the shape of their distribution over the simulation period ( not shown ) deviates significantly from a gaussian profile due to correlations between different non - locally interacting clusters .",
    "that type of pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) is distinctly different than the standard one for chimera states in phase oscillator models @xcite , while it resembles the corresponding one for a globally coupled system of complex ginzburg - landau oscillators @xcite . in figs .",

    "the corresponding curve for the large incoherent cluster in the green ( large ) box has a significantly lower average value and strong fluctuations which do not decrease with time .    in a real squid metamaterial , there is naturally a spread in the parameter values of individual squids due to fabrication - induced imperfections .",
    "the most important source of disorder comes from the critical current of the josephson junctions , which are very sensitive to the thickness and quality of the insulating layer . as a result",
    ", disorder is induced in the squid parameters @xmath75 and their eigenfrequencies @xmath100 . however , with the present technology the spread in @xmath75 could be less than @xmath101 of its nominal value , which makes the squid metamaterial weakly disordered , that could affect the observed chimera states . in order to check the robustness of the chimera states under that perturbation",
    ", we performed additional simulations in which @xmath75 is allowed to vary randomly in an interval up to @xmath102 of its nominal value . for random initial flux configurations ,",
    "we still obtain chimera states , although with different profiles , due to their high metastability , while for zero initial fluxes we obtain low - amplitude synchronized solutions .",
    "we thus conclude that chimera states are robust to weak disorder , and they can not be generated by weak disorder alone in squid metamaterials in the absence of substantial initial fluxes .",

    "the spectrum for the squid at @xmath105 exhibits significant fluctuations , the peak at the driving frequency , and in addition a frequency region around @xmath113 where the average fluctuation level remains approximatelly constant , forming a shoulder that often appears in such spectra for squids in an asynchronous cluster of a chimera state .    in order to determine the metastability levels of the states",

    "squid metamaterials , which comprise non - locally coupled , nonlinear resonant elements , are physical systems where chimeras or other collective effects could be in principle detected .",
    "the emergence of long - lived chimera states in squid metamaterials could be acheived by randomly initializing the fluxes threading the squid rings .",

    ", spontaneous fluxoid formation may occur through the kibble - zurek scenario or by thermal activation , respectively .",
    "the kibble - zurek scenario has been also confirmed in a multi - josephson junction superconducting loop @xcite . in squids , however , fluxoid conservation is only approximate , and practically non - existent in non - hysteretic squids that are considered here .",
    "thus , we would expect that thermal quenching of the squid metamaterial could result in a random initial flux configuration , in which the fluxes can take any value ( i.e. , not only integer multiples of the flux quantum ) .",
    "note that the random flux configuration is just one possible choice of initial conditions for which chimera states could be observed in squid metamaterials .",
    "our numerical simulations rely on a realistic model , which is capable of reproducing experimental findings such as the tuneability patterns of two - dimensional squid metamaterials which are obtained by varying an applied dc flux @xcite .",
    "these simulations indicate that in many cases the coherent and incoherent clusters that make a chimera state maintain their individual sizes for very long times ( @xmath136 t.u . ) . during the integration",
    ", induced instabilities may lead to sudden expansion of the incoherent cluster(s ) , or to the desynchronization of narrow coherent clusters .",
    "the inherent metastability of the chimera states presented here for the non - locally coupled squid metamaterials can be quantified by the strength of the fluctuations of @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding locally coupled squid metamaterials , in which the interaction between squids is limited to their first neighbors , supports non - uniform solutions which however are not chimeras . although both types of states may exhibit a low degree of synchronization , monitored as a function of @xmath25 by @xmath86 , the fluctuations of the latter in time are much stronger for chimera states than for non - uniform states ( more than two orders of magnitude , for the cases shown ) . due to their high metastability levels ,",
