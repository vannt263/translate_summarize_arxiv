    "the dynamics on each site is the same as the single site case , and thus evolves in time as ( [ onesiteevol ] ) , considering the other spins to be approximately fixed .",

    "although it is not possible to solve the set of equations ( [ alleqns ] ) analytically , we may see in this formulation why the whole system should have a speedup of @xmath6 , as found in ref .",
    "considering a asynchronous update procedure ( in fact this is exactly what was performed to simulate the dynamics of the system in the monte carlo procedure @xcite ) , then all but one `` active '' site is fixed in spins .",
    "the active site then evolves in time according to the evolution of ( [ onesiteevol ] ) .",
    "this has a speedup of @xmath110 in the evolution of the spin , thus to make an incremental change @xmath111 in the active spin takes a time reduced by @xmath112 compared to the @xmath113 case .",

    "since each step takes a reduced time of @xmath114 , the whole evolution proceeds at an aceelerated rate . for sufficiently low temperatures , @xmath115 , and",
    "therefore the speedup is approximately @xmath6 .      up to this point , the equations of motion ( [ alleqns ] ) have been entirely deterministic .",
    "the role of the temperature was to merely shift the equilibrium values of the spins , as determined by ( [ equils ] ) , and did not contribute to any stochastic evolution of the system .",
    "in the bec network there are thermal fluctuations which cause the system to behave in a random manner .",
    "therefore in order to fully capture the dynamics of the bec network we must include the contribution of the random thermal process .",
    "such stochastic versions of hopfield networks , and their generalization to the boltzmann machine ( by having additional hidden units ) are defined by modifying the update rule ( [ standardhopfield ] ) to include probabilistic effects .",
    "considering the discrete hopfield model first , the algorithm consists of selecting a particular spin @xmath58 , and making an update according to @xmath116 @xmath117 is the energy difference between the state with the flipped spin and no flipped spin @xcite .    the evolution equations ( [ twositerateequations ] ) for the bec network can be converted into a set of stochastic update rules which give the same time depedence when an ensemble average is taken .",
    "the stochastic formulation also allows for a convenient method of numerically simulating the system , which was discussed in detail in ref .",

    "we calculate the transition weight @xmath119 in ( [ twositerateequations ] ) for all the possible transitions .",
    "the transition is then made with a probability in proportion to the transition weight @xmath120 . the time increment is then calculated according to @xmath121 where @xmath122 $ ] is a randomly generated number and @xmath123 this procedure is repeated for many trajectories so that ensemble averages of quantities such as the average spin can be taken .",
    "this procedure produces exactly the same time dynamics as ( [ twositerateequations ] ) , hence for quantities such as the equilibration time this procedure must be followed .",
    "however , if only the behavior at equilibrium is required , the update procedure can be replaced by the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the update procedure is then as follows .",

    "the only difference in this case is that the bosonic stimulation factors are not present in this case , which are important only for determining the transition rates , and not the equilibrium values .",
    "the above metropolis transition rule ( [ ratioexp ] ) is identical to the stochastic hopfield network , up to the difference that each site contains energy levels between @xmath126 .",
    "it is therefore evidents in this context that the two systems are equivalent in their dynamics .",

    "as found previously , the due to the factors of @xmath0 in ( [ finalsde ] ) originating from bosonically enhanced cooling , the annealing rates may be made @xmath0 times faster , allowing for an accelerated method of finding the solution to ising model problems , as claimed in ref . @xcite .",
    "in the context of the neural networks , learning and memory retrieval are typical tasks which illustrate their utility . due to the equivalence of the bec network to a continuous hopfield model",

    "we apply various magnetic field configurations @xmath155 where @xmath156 labels the various pattern configurations that the network is exposed to during the learning process . starting with the first field configuration @xmath157",

    "we then make subsequent applications of the field @xmath155 , measure the field @xmath108 in each case , then make the replacement ( [ hebbian ] ) . for @xmath161 , the spins do not simply take the values of ( [ firstspins ] ) since the fields @xmath162 will in general be non - zero .",
    "the process is continued until the learning examples are exhausted , or the same set can be recycled .",
    "other learning algorithms may be derived in a similar way using the associations in table [ table1 ] .      as a simple example of the use of the bec network for pattern completion , we test the set of equations given in ( [ alleqns ] ) using an ising matrix trained using the hebbian algorithm of the previous section .",

    "@xcite in terms of the theory of neural networks and found that it is equivalent to a stochastic continuous hopfield model .",
    "in contrast to the continuous hopfield model where the overall timescale of the evolution is determined by the capacitance within each unit , in the bec network the timescale is determined via the rate of cooling . due to bosonic stimulated cooling , the rate of cooling may be accelerated in proportion to the number of bosons @xmath0 on each site , which in turn accelerates the cooling rate of the entire system .",
    "the bosonic stimulated cooling makes the time evolution equations ( [ alleqns ] ) on a single site not precisely the same as its hopfield model counterpart ( [ hopfielddyn ] ) , but the difference merely gives a modification of the dynamics as the system heads towards equilibrium , the overall behaviour of the system as a whole remains the same . in particular , tasks such as pattern completion may be performed using the bec network , in the same way as the hopfield model .    in this context",
    ", it would appear that using a bec network , rather than a physical implemetation of a hopfield network , is nothing but a more complicated way of implementing what could be done equally well by either standard electronics or optical means @xcite .",
    "specifically , one could imagine using simply hopfield circuits with small capacitances such that the timescale of the circuit is as small as desired .",
    "other variations of optical implementations of hopfield models allow for fast operation speeds . while for the zero temperature case this may be true , the bec system does have the advantage that the random fluctuations following boltzmann statistics is already built - in , and do not require additional circuitry to simulate .",
    "another possible advantage is that the speedups can be made systematically faster by simply by increasing the number of bosons .",
    "a possible issue for the physical realization is whether the connections between each ising site require response times of the order of the cooling time on each site .",
    "apart from a simple slowdown due to bottlenecks in the transmission , such delay times in the information between each site can introduce instabilities in the system causing divergent behavior @xcite .",
