    "the nature of the neutrino as a majorana or dirac particle is still an open question .",
    "experimental evidence of lepton - number violation weak processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath5 ) or double electron capture ( @xmath6ecec ) would determine unambiguously the majorana character of this elementary particle .",
    "in particular , in @xmath6ecec a majorana neutrino is exchanged in the capture of two electrons ( @xmath7 ) from the inner shells of an atom with mass number @xmath8 and number of protons @xmath9 : @xmath10 the daughter atom @xmath11 is unstable and decays to its ground state @xmath12 by x - rays and/or auger electrons emission from the electronic excitation and by @xmath13-ray emission if the nucleus is in an excited state . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a schematic view of the process and its energetics .",
    "the capture rate @xmath14 can be written as  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the difference between the initial and final atomic masses , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the energy and the width of the excited state of the daughter atom with two electronic holes in states @xmath20 and an excited nucleus , and @xmath21 is the transition amplitude between the initial and final states  @xcite : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the effective majorana neutrino mass , the fermi constant , the cabbibo angle , the axial - vector coupling constant and the nuclear radius respectively ; @xmath28 is the lepton part of the matrix element that takes into account the atomic electron wave functions of the states @xmath20 and @xmath29 is the nuclear matrix element ( nme )  @xcite .",
    "equation  [ rate ] shows a resonant behavior with an increase of the capture rate whenever @xmath30 is fulfilled , otherwise the process is very much suppressed .",
    "this is a very restricted condition to search for isotopes with a potential @xmath6ecec because typical values for the widths of the atomic states are of the order of electron volts ( ev ) while @xmath17 is found by subtracting two quantities which are of the order of mev .",

    "recently fang et _ al . _",
    "@xcite have extended these calculations to deformed shapes and found a substantial suppression of the nmes that leads to longer half - lives .",
    "however , in these calculations the deformation is a free parameter that is not consistently determined within the model .    in this work",
    "we use an energy density functional ( edf ) method including beyond - mean field correlations to evaluate the @xmath6ecec nmes for these isotopes .",
    "this method was originally developed to study in a self - consistent manner the role of deformation , shape mixing and pairing correlations in @xmath5 nmes  @xcite . here ,",
    "a density - dependent effective two body interaction between the constituent nucleons is assumed as the starting point . then , single particle energies , residual interactions beyond the mean field , pairing and deformation content of the nuclei , transitions and decays rates , etc . , are deduced self - consistently from solving the associated quantum many - body problem . in addition , mixing of different shapes is also allowed within this formalism .",
    "this is a different perspective that the one used in qrpa calculations  @xcite , where the several free parameters of the model are adjusted specifically for each capture . in particular , the deformation of initial and final nuclei",
    "are fitted to reproduce either the spectroscopic quadrupole moment of the @xmath33 state or from the reduced transition probabilities @xmath3 .",
    "the effects of shape mixing , particle number and angular momentum restoration are not considered .",
    "in addition , pairing gaps are also found by fitting at the bcs level experimental even - odd mass differences .",
    "finally , single particle energies and residual interactions do not come from the same underlying interaction , and an additional renormalization is required adding two more adjustable parameters to the model .",
    "we now summarize the formalism that we use to compute the nmes considering that the initial and final nuclei are in their ground states .",

    "the spatial part of the wave functions is affected by the so - called neutrino potentials @xmath40 that include nucleon finite size corrections  @xcite , radial short - range correlations within the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom )  @xcite and higher order currents  @xcite .",
    "detailed expressions for these operators can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "initial ( @xmath41 ) and final ( @xmath42 ) states are found by using configuration mixing techniques based on the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) with particle number and angular momentum restoration of hartree - fock - bogoliubov type ( hfb ) mean - field wave functions  @xcite : @xmath43 where the axial quadrupole deformation @xmath44 is used as the generating coordinate and @xmath45 are the coefficients of the linear combination which are obtained by solving the corresponding hill - wheeler - griffin ( hwg ) equations  @xcite .",
    "the set of wave functions @xmath46 are defined as : @xmath47 being @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 the projection operators on to angular momentum @xmath51 and number of neutrons and protons , respectively ; @xmath52 are hfb type mean - field wave functions that are found by using the variation after particle number projection method  @xcite .",
    "we have used two parametrizations of the gogny force as the underlying density - dependent interaction , namely , the most widely used in nuclear structure calculations d1s  @xcite and the most recent one d1 m  @xcite that is designed to give the best fit to experimental masses in the whole nuclear chart .",
    "experimental observables such as nuclear masses , radii , spectra , transition rates , etc . can be directly compared to the expectation values calculated from the gcm wave functions given in eq .",

    "[ fig5 ] the single particle energies ( s.p.e . ) as a function of the deformation for the @xmath58 isotopes .",
    "a similar analysis applies also to the rest of isotopes studied here . in the spherical point ( @xmath59 )",
    "these levels have a degeneracy equal to @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 this degeneracy is broken in @xmath62 doubly degenerated levels .",
    "in the following discussion we maintain the name of the spherical orbits for referring the different levels .",
    "it is well known that pairing energies are larger whenever the level density around the fermi energy is larger .",
    "this is precisely what it is observed in the range of deformations @xmath63 $ ] where proton levels coming from the orbits @xmath64 are very close in energy . for the neutrons ,",
    "the fact that the spherical orbit @xmath65 is not fully occupied , and the fast lowering of the @xmath66 levels and a rising of the @xmath67 induced by prolate deformation leads to a large level density around spherical shapes .",
    "hence , large pairing correlations are expected there and , correspondingly , large nmes are predicted . on the other hand , for larger prolate deformations ( @xmath68 $ ] ) we observe that the density of levels around the fermi level is smaller for protons and neutrons . in particular , gaps are found in the proton s.p.e .",
    "produced by the emptying of some levels coming from the @xmath69 and the filling of intruder @xmath70 orbits . in the neutron part ,",
    "the reduction of the level density is due to the sharp decrease of some @xmath71 levels , which start to be occupied at @xmath72 , and the increase of some orbits from @xmath73 .    the final results for the nmes and half - lives calculated with d1s and d1 m parametrizations are summarized in the table  [ table2 ] .",
    "we observe smaller values of the nmes for the d1 m parametrization although the difference between the results is not very significant .",
    "the largest nme corresponds to the decay of @xmath0gd that , together with a large resonance enhancement , results in the shortest half - live among the candidates studied here @xmath74 y ) . in the evaluation of the half - lives we assume a neutrino majorana mass @xmath75 mev and the values of @xmath28 , @xmath76 and @xmath19",
    "are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite corresponding to the electronic transition that gives the shorter half - life in each case .",
    "we also compare the nmes obtained in this work with the most recent deformed qrpa calculations  @xcite .",
    "our values are a factor @xmath77 smaller than the qrpa ones .",
    "however , larger nmes are obtained within our approach if we neglect the configuration mixing and assume single deformations for initial and final states similar to the ones used in qrpa calculations .",
    "this shows again the relevance of the deformation and configuration mixing in determining the value of the nmes .",
    "in summary , we have used a state - of - the - art energy density functional method to compute nuclear matrix elements for the most promising @xmath6ecec candidates .",
    "our approach includes particle number and angular momentum symmetry restoration and shape mixing along the axial quadrupole deformation @xmath44 , using gogny d1s and d1 m as the underlying interactions .",
    "we observe a strong reduction of the nmes whenever the deformation of mother and daughter nuclei is not close to the spherical shape .",
    "all isotopes studied here have a large prolate deformation , and therefore , we predict very small values of the nmes . finally , for all cases considered in this work we find half - lives longer than @xmath4 years despite the large resonance enhancement found in very recent experiments for these nuclei .",
