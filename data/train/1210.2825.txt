    "<S> a key idea is to consider a heterostructure system which consists of the 3d cs ti and a chiral - symmetry - broken ( csb ) trivial insulator with the hamiltonian , as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , the trivial insulator means that @xmath19 in the bulk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we can consider the csb trivial insulator with inversion symmetry in the bulk which ensures @xmath19 . to deal with spatially varying heterostructure systems , </S>",
    "<S> we utilize an adiabatic approach . </S>",
    "<S> that is , as long as there is a finite energy gap which separates the ground state and the first excited states , the interface structure can be smoothly deformed to the slowly varying one . in the slowly varying structure , </S>",
    "<S> the position operator @xmath20 in the hamiltonian can be treated as a parameter ( adiabatic parameter ) independent of 3d momentum @xmath21 , which parametrizes the spatial inhomogeneity of the heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> then , the magnetoelectric polarization @xmath22 is constructed from the adiabatic hamiltonian of the heterostructure system , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 interpolates between the bulk hamiltonian of the cs ti , @xmath24 , and that of the csb trivial insulator , @xmath25 , when @xmath26 is varied ; i.e. @xmath27 when @xmath26 is a point in the bulk of the cs ti , and @xmath28 when @xmath26 in the bulk of the csb trivial insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic approach was exploited before to derive electromagnetic responses of the tri z@xmath0 tis from the axion field theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to extend the adiabatic argument for the z@xmath0 non - triviality to the z nontrivial electromagnetic responses . </S>",
    "<S> we , first consider the quantum anomalous hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the heterostructure junction system , the anomalous hall effect caused by surface dirac fermions is obtained by integrating @xmath26-direction under a @xmath26-independent electromagnetic field , @xmath29 \\\\ & = \\frac{e^2}{2 \\pi \\hbar c } \\left ( \\int_{z_0,c}^{z_1 } dz \\frac{d p_3(z)}{d z } \\right ) \\int dtd^2 x \\epsilon_{\\mu \\nu \\rho } a_{\\mu } \\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\rho}.   \\end{split}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is a point in the cs ti ( csb trivial insulator ) , and @xmath32 is a path of @xmath26-integral . </S>",
    "<S> hence the hall conductivity is given by , @xmath33 there are two important remarks . </S>",
    "<S> first , although the magnetoelectric polarization @xmath16 is gauge - invariant only for mod @xmath34 , the line integral of a small difference of @xmath22 is fully gauge - invariant . </S>",
    "<S> second , @xmath35 is determined not only by the bulk magnetoelectric polarization at the point @xmath30 and that at the point @xmath31 , but also by a homologous equivalence class of the path @xmath32 . this means that @xmath35 depends on the microscopic structure of the interface , and is not protected solely by the bulk topology . </S>",
    "<S> the concrete path @xmath32 is determined by the signs of the mass gaps of dirac fermions on the surface of the cs ti . in our system </S>",
    "<S> , the mass gaps are generated by the chiral - symmetry breaking field induced by the csb trivial insulator at the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we consider the case that the sign of the chiral - symmetry breaking field , and hence , that of the induced mass gaps are uniform on the interface between the cs ti and the csb trivial insulator . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the hamiltonian @xmath25 satisfying this condition is generally expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) for any @xmath21 , and @xmath6 is the chiral symmetry operator mentioned before , and @xmath39 does not generate mass gaps of the surface dirac fermions . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that @xmath6 itself plays the role of a chiral - symmetry breaking field . </S>",
    "<S> then the winding number @xmath18 for @xmath24 and the magnetoelectric polarization @xmath22 for the adiabatic hamiltonian @xmath23 satisfies the following relation , @xmath40 this relation is one of our central new findings . </S>",
    "<S> we present a sketch of the proof of eq.([n3p3 ] ) below . </S>",
    "<S> the details are given in the supplemental materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the magnetoelectric polarization of the cs ti with the winding number @xmath18 is @xmath41 , the value of @xmath42 is fixed by chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> also , as mentioned above , the value of @xmath43 in the csb trivial insulator is fixed to be zero . due to these fixed boundary values </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath44 is adiabatically invariant , which means that this quantity is not changed unless the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state closes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can deform @xmath45 to a flat band system : @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath25 mentioned above is deformed to @xmath47 without closing the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> then , the adiabatically equivalent class of flat band hamiltonian @xmath45 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is a projection to the occupied bands of @xmath24 , and @xmath51 monotonically changes from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , as @xmath26 changes from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show @xmath54 @xcite , where @xmath55 is the magnetoelectric polarization of @xmath56 defined by ( [ mep ] ) .    . </S>",
    "<S> in ( b ) and ( c ) , we assume cs ti ( tsc ) is coated by a csb trivial insulator ( sc ) so that the interface structure has a finite energy gap anywhere . ]    using eqs.([n3p3 ] ) and ( [ qahe ] ) together , we can readily obtain the remarkable result that the winding number @xmath18 can appear in the quantized hall conductivity for the heterostructure system depicted in fig.1(a ) , @xmath57 hence , the z non - triviality of cs tis can be detected experimentally in this electromagnetic response .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also apply the formula ( [ n3p3 ] ) to the investigation on topological magnetoelectric effects which are characterized not by the z@xmath0 invariant , but by the z invariant @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the heterostructure system depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and ( c ) , which consists of a cylindrical cs ti with its surface coated by a csb trivial insulators . </S>",
    "<S> from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ n3p3 ] ) , the magnetoelectric polarization of the cs ti coated by the csb trivial insulator is given by @xmath58 , which leads the magnetoelectric effect , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xcite i.e. , @xmath61 @xmath62 here , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are an electric field and a magnetic field applied parallel to the axis of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the winding number successfully appears in the above magnetoelectric responses . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that if the system is extended without open boundaries and possesses translational symmetry , magnetoelectric polarization ( [ mep ] ) is gauge - dependent under large gauge transformation so that @xmath65 where @xmath66 is integer . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pb ] ) and ( [ me ] ) implies that the particular choice of the configuration of the heterostructure as depicted in fig.1(b ) and ( c ) corresponds to the particular choice of the gauge that can extract the winding number of the ti in the heterostructure system .    </S>",
    "<S> _ case of tri tscs  </S>",
    "<S> _ the above argument is also applicable to class diii tri tscs in three dimensions . in the case of tscs with spin - triplet pairing , since both charge and spin are not conserved , it is difficult to detect the topological character in electromagnetic responses . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead , thermal responses can be a good probe for the topological nontriviality , because surface majorana fermions still preserve energy . an effective low energy theory for the thermal responses of tscs </S>",
    "<S> is the gravitational axion field theory described by the action @xcite , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a gravitoelectric field which play the same role as temperature gradient @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a gravitomagnetic field , which is in analogy with a magnetic field of electromagnetism , and @xmath72 is the fermi velocity . because of time - reversal symmetry , @xmath16 in the above action ( [ tsc - axion ] ) , takes only two values , i.e. @xmath73 or @xmath74 , implying the z@xmath0 non - triviality , and hence eq.([tsc - axion ] ) is an incomplete description for the z nontrivial tscs . </S>",
    "<S> however , as in the case of class aiii tis discussed above , the winding number @xmath18 can be detected as thermal responses in a certain class of heterostructure system . in the case of class aiii tis , an important role </S>",
    "<S> is played by the chiral - symmetry - breaking field @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , also in the case of tri tscs , the winding number appears in the heterostructure system composed of a tri tsc and a trivial phase with broken chiral - symmetry . for a @xmath75-wave tsc which is realized in @xmath1he , cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath3 and li@xmath0pt@xmath3b , </S>",
    "<S> the chiral - symmetry - breaking field is nothing but an s - wave pairing gap with broken time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily seen from the fact that the s - wave pairing term of the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the s - wave gap , and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is the pauli matrix for particle - hole ( spin ) space , and the chiral symmetry operator @xmath6 is expressed as @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> when the imaginary part of @xmath77 is nonzero , this term breaks chiral - symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> thus , eq.([n3p3 ] ) is applicable for the heterostructure system composed of a tri tsc and a trivial @xmath81-wave sc with broken time - reversal symmetry , as long as the real part of the s - wave gap does not yield gap - closing . for the system depicted in figs.1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) the quantum anomalous thermal hall effect and the topological gravitomagetoelectric effects associated with the winding number are realized . </S>",
    "<S> combining the gravitational axion field theory ( [ tsc - axion ] ) and the relation ( [ n3p3 ] ) , we obtain the quantum anomalous thermal hall conductivity , @xmath82 realized for the system shown in fig.1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result essentially coincides with that obtained by wang et al . from the argument based on surface majorana fermions @xcite . we can also obtain the gravitomagnetoelectric effects , @xmath83 @xmath84 realized for the system shown in fig.1(b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([gme1 ] ) implies that circulating energy current flows surrounding the axis of the cylinder induces the energy ( or thermal ) polarization , resulting in nonzero temperature gradient along the axis . </S>",
    "<S> the winding number explicitly appears in this thermal response .    _ chiral polarization and the winding number _ </S>",
    "<S> hitherto , we have explored the z topological responses in heterostructure junction systems in which the winding number successfully emerges as the quantum hall effect and the topological magnetoelectric effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still desirable to establish a direct connection between the winding number and the bulk physical quantities , as in the case of the quantum hall effect in a two - dimensional electron gas and z@xmath0 tis . </S>",
    "<S> we pursue this possibility here . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we introduce the chiral polarization defined by , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the wannier function , @xmath87 is the unit cell volume , and @xmath88 is the projected chiral position operator defined by @xmath89 with @xmath90 a position operator and @xmath91 the projection to the occupies states . generally , to construct the wannier function localized exponentially in real space , we need the absence of gauge obstruction of the bloch wave function , i.e. , vanishing of chern number @xmath92 @xcite . in chiral symmetric systems , the chern numbers @xmath93 are zeroes @xcite , and hence the exponentially localized wannier functions are always well defined . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiralp ] ) is similar to charge polarization , but an important difference is that the chiral symmetry operator @xmath6 is inserted in ( [ chiralp ] ) . for the class aiii tis and the class bdi tis with two sub - lattice structures , @xmath94 represents a difference of charge polarization between two sub - lattices . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that in contrast to charge polarization which depends on the choice of gauge , @xmath94 is gauge - invariant , since the gauge ambiguity cancels out between the two sub - lattice contributions @xcite . as will be shown below </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath94 is a key bulk quantity which can be related to the winding number . </S>",
    "<S> actually , in the case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , @xmath94 is expressed by the 1d winding number @xmath95 as @xcite , @xmath96 for instance , for the 1d bdi class tis such as the su - schrieffer - heeger model of polyacetylene , eq.([p5n1 ] ) represents fractional charges which appear at open edges of the system . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([p5n1 ] ) is derived from non - trivial algebraic properties satisfied by @xmath88 , which can be regarded as a generalization of the commutation relation of the projected position operator @xmath97 @xcite . in the 3d case </S>",
    "<S> , this algebra also yields an interesting result that the winding number @xmath18 is expressed by the nambu three bracket of @xmath88@xcite , which recently attracts much attentions in connection with the density algebra in 3d tis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have not yet succeeded to relate the nambu bracket to any physical quantities in condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we here take a different approach for the 3d case . in fact , in the case of 3d aiii tis , on the assumption that the occupied and unoccupied wannier states satisfy the chiral symmetry @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , a more remarkable and useful relation between @xmath94 and the winding number @xmath18 can be derived ; @xmath94 can be induced by an applied magnetic field , in analogy with the topological magnetoelectric effect , and furthermore , @xmath18 appears in the response function . from the first - order perturbative calculation with respect to a magnetic field , we obtain @xcite , @xmath100 thus , the winding number can be detected as the chiral polarization induced by a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is another main result of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that an analogous effect may be realized in 3d tri tscs . in the case of tscs , to explore topological characters , we need to consider thermal responses , instead of electromagnetic ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have not yet succeeded to obtain thermal analogue of eq.([p5b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is highly non - trivial what @xmath94 means for the case of superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> these are important open issues which should be addressed in the near future .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion  _ we have clarified that the z non - triviality of 3d tri tscs and tis with sub - lattice symmetry can appear in electromagnetic and thermal responses of heterostructure systems which consist of the tscs or tis and csb trivial s - wave superconductors or band insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we have also established the relation between the bulk winding number and the bulk chiral polarization , which may be utilized for experimental detection of the z non - triviality .    </S>",
