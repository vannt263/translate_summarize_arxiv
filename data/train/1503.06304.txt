    "we are going to apply proposition  [ prop : auxg_k ] with sets @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "notice that every edge of @xmath23 which contains a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath262 and the remaining vertex from @xmath336 must be colored red .",
    "( this is because for a @xmath240-tuple to end up in @xmath262 , there must have been no vertex @xmath89 in step   that could extend the blue path . )",
    "it also follows from step that each @xmath240-tuple in @xmath262 is contained in at least one blue edge .",
    "thus , proposition  [ prop : auxg_k ] implies that @xmath337 .",
    "that means that the number of red edges which contain a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath262 and the remaining vertex from @xmath319 is at least @xmath78 times the number of blue edges with a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath262 .",

    "again , if @xmath341 , then we use the same argument as above to find that the number of red edges in @xmath338 which contain a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath339 and the remaining vertex from @xmath319 is at least @xmath78 times the number of blue edges in @xmath338 with a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath339 .",
    "indeed , we can again apply the inequality from proposition .",
    "this is because @xmath342 is smaller than the number of all blue edges in @xmath23 containing a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath339 , while ( since we do not remove red edges ) @xmath343 remains same in both @xmath338 and @xmath23 . now remove the blue edges from @xmath338 which contain a @xmath240-tuple from @xmath339 obtaining a @xmath2-graph @xmath344 .",
    "keep repeating the procedure until it is no longer possible .    at some point",
    ", we will run out of blue edges in @xmath345 for some @xmath346 , and the procedure will terminate prematurely in step  . in this case",
    "@xmath347 , @xmath348 and @xmath319 has no blue edges .",
    "however , there still may be some blue edges which contain a vertex from @xmath349 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : auxg_k ] ( applied for @xmath350 ) implies that the number of such edges is at most @xmath244    let @xmath351 and @xmath352 be the numbers corresponding to @xmath226 and @xmath230 obtained at the end of the procedure applied to @xmath353 .",
    "thus , @xmath354 for each @xmath355 .",
    "let @xmath356 and @xmath357 denote the number of red and blue edges in @xmath23 .",
    "observe that @xmath358 furthermore , since all sets @xmath359 are mutually disjoint , each red edge in @xmath23 containing a @xmath240-tuple from some @xmath359 can be only counted at most @xmath2 times .",
    "thus , @xmath360 consequently , by and , we get @xmath361 and so @xmath362 the conclusion is that there are more red edges than there are blue edges in @xmath23 .",
    "if we reverse the procedure and look for a red path instead of a blue one , we will conclude that there are more blue edges than red edges .",
    "since these two statements contradict each other , the only way to avoid both statements is if a monochromatic path exists .",
