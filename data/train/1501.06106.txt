    "prior acquaintance with the concepts of _ partitioned genus distribution _ ( abbreviated here as _ * pgd * _ ) and _ production _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) are necessary preparation for reading this paper .",
    "the exposition here is otherwise intended to be accessible both to graph theorists and to combinatorialists .",
    "the number of combinatorially distinct embeddings of a graph  @xmath0 in the orientable surface of genus  @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the sequence @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is called the _ * genus distribution * _ of @xmath0 .",
    "a genus distribution contains only finitely many positive numbers , and there are no zeros between the first and last positive numbers .",
    "the _ * genus polynomial * _ is the polynomial @xmath7    log - concave sequences    a sequence @xmath8 is said to be _ * nonnegative * _ , if @xmath9 for all  @xmath10 .",
    "an element  @xmath11 is said to be an _ * internal zero * _ of  @xmath12 if @xmath13 and if there exist indices @xmath1 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 . if @xmath17 for all @xmath10 , then @xmath12 is said to be _ * log - concave*_. if there exists an index  @xmath18 with @xmath19 such that @xmath20 then @xmath12 is said to be _ * unimodal*_. it is well - known that any nonnegative log - concave sequence without internal zeros is unimodal , and that any nonnegative unimodal sequence has no internal zeros .",
    "a prior paper @xcite by the present authors provides additional contextual information regarding log - concavity and genus distributions .    for convenience ,",
    "we sometimes abbreviate the phrase `` log - concave genus distribution '' as _ * lcgd*_. proofs that closed - end ladders and doubled paths have lcgds @xcite were based on explicit formulas for their genus distributions . proof that bouquets have lcgds @xcite was based on a recursion . a conjecture that all graphs have lcgds was published by @xcite .",
    "stahl s method @xcite of representing what we have elsewhere formulated as simultaneous recurrences @xcite or as a transposition of a _ production system _ for a surgical operation on graph embeddings as a matrix of polynomials can simplify a proof that a family of graphs has log - concave genus distributions , without having to derive the genus distribution itself .",
    "newton s theorem that real - rooted polynomials with non - negative coefficients are log - concave is one way of getting log - concavity .",
    "stahl @xcite made the general conjecture ( conjecture 6.4 ) that all genus polynomials are real - rooted , and he gave a collection of specific test families .",
    "shortly thereafter , wagner @xcite proved that the genus distributions for the related closed - end ladders and various other test families suggested by @xcite are real - rooted .",
    "however , liu and wang @xcite answered stahl s general conjecture in the negative , by exhibiting a chain of copies of the wheel graph @xmath21 , one of stahl s test families , that is not real - rooted .",
    "our previous paper @xcite proves , nonetheless , that the genus distribution of every graph in the @xmath21-linear sequence is log - concave .",
    "thus , even though stahl s proposed approach to log - concavity via roots of genus polynomials is sometimes infeasible , results in @xcite do support stahl s expectation that chains of copies of a graph are a relatively accessible aspect of the general lcgd problem .",
    "the genus distributions for the family of ringel ladders , whose log - concavity is proved in this paper , are not real - rooted either .",
    "log - concavity of genus distributions for directed graph embeddings has been studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another related area is the continuing study of maximum genus of graphs , of which @xcite is an example .",
    "linear , ringlike , and tree - like families    stahl used the term``@xmath22-linear '' to describe chains of graphs that are constructed by amalgamating copies of a fixed graph @xmath22 .",
    "such amalgamations are typically on a pair of vertices , one in each of the amalgamands , or on a pair of edges .",
    "it seems reasonable to generalize the usage of _ * linear * _ in several ways , for instance , by allowing graphs in the chain to be selected from a finite set .",
    "we use the term _ * ring - like * _ to describe a graph that results from any of the following topological operations on a doubly rooted linear chain with one root in the first graph of the chain and one in the last graph :    1 .   a self - amalgamation of two root - vertices ; 2 .",
    "a self - amalgamation of two root - edges ; 3 .   joining one root - vertex to the other root - vertex ( which is called a _ * self - bar - amalgamation * _ ) .",
    "every graph can be regarded as _ * tree - like * _ in the sense of tree decompositions .",
    "however , we use this term only when a graph is not linear or ring - like . for any fixed tree - width @xmath23 and fixed maximum degree @xmath24",
    ", there is a quadratic - time algorithm @xcite to calculate the genus polynomial of graphs of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". one plausible approach to the general lcgd conjecture might be to prove it for fixed tree - width and fixed maximum degree .",
    "recurrences have been given for the the genus distributions of cubic outerplanar graphs @xcite , 4-regular outerplanar graphs @xcite , and cubic halin graphs @xcite , all three of which are tree - like .",
    "however , none of these genus distributions have been proved to be log - concave . nor have any other tree - like graphs been proved to have lcgds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes a representation of partitioning of the genus distribution into ten parts as a _ pgd - vector_. section 3 describes how _ productions _ are used to describe the effect of a graph operation on the pgd - vector .",
    "section 4 analyzes how self - bar amalgamation affects the genus distribution .",
    "section 5 offers a new derivation of the genus distributions of the ringel ladders and proof that these genus distributions are log - concave .",
    "a fundamental strategy in the calculation of genus distributions , from the outset @xcite , has been to partition a genus distribution according to the incidence of face - boundary walks on one or more roots .",
