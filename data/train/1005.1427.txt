    "our aim is to provide a better approximation than those proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and this is achieved by the inclusion of all relevant terms of the background dimensionality 8 ( which equals twice the order of the coefficient @xmath13 $ ] or the total number of derivatives of the metric tensor in each term ) in the renormalized effective action .",

    "the calculation of the functional derivatives of the effective action with respect to @xmath21 is rather tedious and time consuming process .",
    "fortunately , for the spherically- symmetric geometries one can considerably simplify calculations . indeed , substituting the line element of the general static and spherically - symmetric spacetime expressed in the schwarzschild gauge into the effective action and performing simple integrations one obtains a reduced functional that depends on the two metric potentials .",
    "two components of the stress - energy tensor are given by appropriate lagrange derivatives of the lagrangian of the reduced action functional with respect to the time and radial components of the metric tensor .",
    "this approach is justified by the symmetric criticality theorems of palais  @xcite and the remaining components can easily be calculated form the covariant conservation equation .",

    "before proceeding to the calculation of the renormalized stress - energy tensor in the reissner - nordstrm geometry let us construct @xmath53 as it shares some of the general features of the full stress - energy tensor while simultaneously being calculationally less involved .",
    "for example , if the next - to - leading term in the expansion leads to substantial improvement of the result it is likely that the quality of the analytic approximation of the stress - energy tensor would also improve .",
    "similarly , if the vacuum polarization diverges on the event horizon it is quite probable that the stress - energy tensor is also divergent there .",

    "similarly , for a given @xmath66 the modification caused by the next - to - next - to - leading term is small everywhere outside the event horizon .",

    "in this work our goal was to construct the approximate field fluctuation and renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive field in the spacetime of the reissner - nordstrm black hole and to investigate how the higher - order terms of the expansions ( [ weff ] ) and ( [ fluctsq ] ) affect the final results .",

    "it has been found that in both cases the minimal approximations are to be constructed from the first two terms of ( [ fluctsq ] ) and ( [ weff ] ) for the field fluctuation and the stress - energy tensor , respectively .",
    "although we have constructed the general form of the stress - energy tensor up to the next - to - leading terms by functional differentiation of the action functional with respect to the metric , here we proposed a computationally simpler method in which the reduced action functionals are varied with respect to the functions @xmath143 and @xmath144 both methods , when overlap , give , of course , identical results .",
    "we hope that our results will be of use in further calculations .",
    "we indicate a few possible directions of investigations .",
    "first , it would be interesting to analyze the back reaction of the quantized massive field upon the geometry of the reissner - nordstrm black hole . due to simplicity of the stress - energy tensor in the reisssner - nordstrm spacetime the quantum - corrected metric",
    "can easily be constructed performing two elementary quadratures .",
    "since the quantum part in the right hand side of the semiclassical einstein field equations is calculated in a large mass limit it is purely geometric quantity and can be expressed solely in terms of the riemann tensor , its covariant derivatives and contractions .",
    "this allows to treat the semiclassical theory as the higher derivative theory and construct various characteristics encoded in the geometry of the quantum - corrected black hole such as location of the horizons in nondegenerate as well as degenerate case  @xcite , equations of motion of the test particles  @xcite , temperature and entropy  @xcite and energy - momentum complexes  @xcite .",
    "further , construction of the approximate stress - energy tensor as well as the field fluctuation in more complex backgrounds and the accompanying numerical calculations would certainly strengthen our understanding of the problem .",
    "especially interesting in this regard is the problem of the lukewarm  @xcite and ultraextremal  @xcite black holes .",
    "finally , an important and interesting continuation of the calculations presented in this paper would be construction of the of the next - to - leading term of the spinor and vector fields .",
