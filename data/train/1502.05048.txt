    "<S> [ fig : peak_heights ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is excellent agreement between theory and experiment . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath26 differs appreciably from @xmath25 and we extract a value of order @xmath99 . while in principle , one could also rely on the main peaks to extract @xmath25 and @xmath26 , this is less accurate since andreev current and thermal peaks also contribute to the total current .    </S>",
    "<S> if the relaxation process relied on directly exciting a quasiparticle from the shiba state to the continuum , we would predict a ratio of the relaxation rates at the two experimental temperatures of order @xmath100 . we can account for a substantial part of the apparent discrepancy with our observations by recalling that there are additional shiba states . </S>",
    "<S> if relaxation proceeds as a multistep process which first excites to the second shiba state , we predict a ratio of relaxation rates which is consistent with experiment ( see also @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions._we show that stm experiments on subgap states in superconductors probe both single - electron and andreev tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that such experiments are particularly fruitful when performed with superconducting tips . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> thermal smearing can be neglected and the temperature dependence of the current arises entirely from activated quasiparticle relaxation processes . moreover , the additional thermal peaks facilitate the analysis and provide access to the relaxation rates . </S>",

    "<S> this regime can be used to map out the bound - state wavefunction . at stronger tip - substrate tunneling , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the normal - state conductance becomes sublinear . </S>",
