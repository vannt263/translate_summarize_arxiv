    "bilayer fluid membranes@xcite spontaneously self assemble when aliphatic molecules are dissolved in water at a sufficiently high concentration . at high temperature ,",
    "these membranes have no internal order and can be modeled as fluctuating structureless surfaces characterized by a bare bending rigidity @xmath0 .",
    "the bending rigidity is length - scale dependent and becomes zero at the persistence length @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a molecular length and @xmath3 is the temperature . at length scales",
    "less than of order @xmath4 , the membrane is flat ; at longer length scales , it is crumpled .",
    "a flat rigid membrane can have quasi - long - range ( qlr ) hexatic order @xcite at low temperature and undergo a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) disclination unbinding transition @xcite to a disordered high - temperature phase .",
    "a fluctuating membrane can also have qlr hexatic order @xcite .",
    "hexatic order stiffens the bending rigidity so that , rather than scaling to zero at long length scales , it approaches a constant times the hexatic rigidity @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the hexatic membrane is thus more rigid than a fluid membrane , and it is said to be  crinkled \" rather than crumpled .",
    "a fluctuating hexatic membrane can undergo a kt transition from the crinkled to the crumpled state .",
    "reference discussed two possible mechanisms for the crinkled - to - crumpled transition : disclination melting and crumpling .",
    "the latter mechanism is analogous to that producing the flat - to - crumpled transition in tethered membranes@xcite and is argued to be associated with the buckling instability@xcite of a membrane with a single disclination .",
    "figure [ gtfig ] shows a schematic phase - flow diagram in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane ( @xmath8 ) for a @xmath9 membrane embedded in three dimensions adapted from ref . .",
    "the vertical line at @xmath10 is the kosterlitz - thouless disclination unbinding line of a flat membrane .",
    "the curved line joining the vertical line at @xmath11 is an estimate of the crumpling transition obtained by equating the energy of a single positive disclination in a buckled membrane to its entropy .",
    "thus , the crumpling transition in this estimate is a kosterlitz - thouless transition in a buckled membrane .",
    "this schematic phase diagram describes qualitatively features that are in agreement with simple physical reasoning : for large @xmath0 , there should be a disclination melting to the crumpled phase as temperature is increased , and at fixed @xmath5 , there should be a transition to the crumpled phase as @xmath0 is decreased .",
    "it , however , has features that are either unexpected or unexplained .",
    "the discontinuous change in curvature where the melting and crumpling lines join is surely an artifact .",
    "it suggests that the physics of the crinkled - to - crumpled transition produced by decreasing @xmath5 at fixed @xmath0 and by decreasing @xmath0 at fixed @xmath5 are totally different , the latter being associated with the buckling instability of a membrane with a single disclination .",
    "it leaves unanswered whether the buckling instability line for the zero temperature membrane has any significance for a membrane in thermal equilibrium , which is allowed to choose disclination configurations to minimize its free energy and thereby to reject highly energetic configurations with an excess of positive or negative disclinations .    in this paper , we present a detailed analysis of the low - temperature crinkled - to - crumpled transition in hexatic membranes .",
    "our approach treats both disclinations and gaussian curvature in the same real - space renormalization procedure and allows us to obtain recursion relations for @xmath0 , @xmath5 and the disclination fugacity @xmath12 .",

    "there are two coulomb - like terms in this hamiltonian : one which is zero when the local disclinations density equals the local gaussian curvature and one , arising from the imposition of a covariant cutoff@xcite , that couples gaussian curvature to gaussian curvature .",
    "finally , we transform the coulomb - gas hamiltonian to a sine - gordon hamiltonian with a term coupling the sine - gordon field @xmath30 to the gaussian curvature with an imaginary coefficient .",

    "we show in particular that the renormalized hexatic rigidity appearing in orientational correlation function is the same as that calculated from the free energy .",

    "these equations show that height fluctuations renormalize the hexatic rigidity in the absence of disclinations .",
    "this renormalized rigidity then flows under renormalization in the presence of disclination in exactly the same way as the rigidity of a flat membrane .",
