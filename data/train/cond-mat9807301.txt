    "the importance of phase transitions with several order parameters is very well known in different branches of physics @xcite .",
    "a great amount of theoretical work has been done in order to understand and construct accurate phase diagrams .",
    "as is well known , two different approaches are usually employed , one more phenomenological by introducing landau polynomial potentials which try to describe experimental singular behaviors and the second one applying catastrophe theory ( ct ) ( also known as singularity theory @xcite ) and thus adopting a more methodological point of view . even in the second case",
    "there are several ways to deal with phase transitions and diagrams .",
    "most works adopting the second point of view start with the canonical unfoldings as given and base their treatments on the effect of perturbations leading to preserving or not the internal symmetry of the system considered or , in other words , they focus their analysis in the symmetry - breaking character of some phase transitions . the procedure we adopt here is different since we begin with a thermodynamic potential ( for example , the gibbs potential ) , assuming a mean field approach , and we apply an algorithm or program according to the general mathematical theorems established by ct , in order to extract all the topological information of the original thermodynamics potential . in a recent paper",
    "we have applied this ct program to a three component model phase diagram and we have found for a one order parameter potential the highest singularity with codimension five to be the _ wigwam _ or @xmath3 catastrophe @xcite .    our ct program could be briefly stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath4 be a real function with state variables @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and control parameters @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ; that is , @xmath9",
    ". then we must take the subsequent steps :    1 .",
    "we pick ( @xmath10 ) such that @xmath11 is a _ degenerate critical point _ of @xmath12 and we consider the unfolding @xmath13 and @xmath14 to translate @xmath11 to the origin of coordinates .",
    "we calculate the determinacy and codimension of @xmath15 from the @xmath16-jet of @xmath15 .",
    "of course , if @xmath15 is @xmath16-determinate then @xmath17 , that is , the function @xmath15 is equal to @xmath18 up to a change of coordinates . in other words , they are _ equivalent _ and have qualitatively the same properties ; therefore , both have the same codimension , cod@xmath19 cod@xmath20 .",
    "3 .   we study the @xmath16-transversality of @xmath21 . if this function is @xmath16-tranversal we can affirm that @xmath21 and the canonical form of the unfolding of @xmath15 are isomorphic .",
    "then we can replace the original @xmath22 function by this canonical unfolding .",
    "if not , we can state that the @xmath22 function is not susceptible to be studied by ct .",
    "+    ct has usually not been applied in a rigorous way using all these concepts and theorems needed for its correct implementation .",
    "this catastrophe program proposed here provides a very useful and systematic way to examine and classify with not very much effort general behaviors of physical systems .",
    "in particular , we emphasize the study of transversality of the actual thermodynamical potentials which guarantees that those simple forms ( polynomial potentials or canonical forms ) represent indeed up to a diffeomorphism the original thermodynamical potential . following this ct program",
    "we do not need to invoke any convention ( for example , delay or maxwell convention ) in order to classify degenerate or non - degenerate critical points on the state variables space .",
    "both conventions are not intrinsic to ct .",
    "only when we deal with the time evolution or when dynamical considerations about the physical system are considered , a given convention could be advisable .",
    "in particular , when the order of a phase transition needs to be determined a convention is necessary because the transition occurs when an appropriate separatrix in the control parameter space is crossed .    here",
    "we will focus our attention on the lattice gas model for a system with three components which simulates , in particular , a binary fluid mixture .",
    "a wide literature has already been devoted to it from different points of view , restricted to the case with one order parameter .",
    "in fact , very few studies with these methods can be found for phase transitions with two order parameters @xcite . this is rather surprising since the landau potential for the three - state potts model , which is a particularly important three - component model ,",
    "has long been known to have two order parameters @xcite .",
    "we shall perform a complete ct study of the case with two order parameters , which is the maximum number for this model .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the thermodynamical potential to be analyzed , give its physical interpretation and discuss general stability questions which help connect usual concepts in thermodynamics with those in catastrophe theory . in section 3",
    "we apply the ct program to the potential previously introduced by considering the singularities with corank equal to 2 and establish the elementary catastrophes associated . in section 4 , we analyze in more detail the potts model as a particular case .",
    "the last section is devoted to a discussion of the previous results and of the structure of the phase diagram entailed by them .",
    "in the mean field theory , the gibbs potential is a function of the concentration of two of the three components and depends on three thermodynamical parameters , which can be taken as the temperature and the chemical potentials of the two components , and on three molecular parameters .",
    "the phase diagram deduced from this function is an accurate description of the system , except close to the ( multi)critical points , where fluctuations become important and alter significantly the mean field theory predictions .",
    "for this reason , the gibbs potential has been the basis for determining the overall phase diagram @xcite .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite a phenomenological model for a ternary mixture is obtained by assuming the gibbs potential in the form @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 gives the number of total moles and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the moles of each component .",
    "the variables @xmath28 are the mole fractions defined by @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; and hence we have the constraint @xmath32 this model can be derived from the mean field theory of a lattice model hamiltonian with variables taking three different states , representing the molecules of the three components @xcite .",
    "then @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent molecular interaction parameters .",
    "the two order parameters to be considered in the sequel can be roughly thought of as the two independent differences between concentrations allowed by the constraint ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "several systems of interest are described by this gibbs potential , eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) : a ternary mixture at constant volumen , for example , a mixture of metals ; a spin lattice where the molecules have spin one ; a binary fluid mixture , where one of the three states represents a vacancy instead of a new molecule and the corresponding concentration is associated to a variable total volumen . in the last case ,",
    "the possible phases are vapor , miscible liquid mixture and inmiscible liquid mixture .",
    "the convenient extensive variables are the specific volume @xmath35 and the relative concentration @xmath36 of the two fluids and the intensive variables are the pressure and the chemical potential of one of the fluids . moreover , the thermodynamical potential eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) depends on @xmath37 and @xmath38 and is therefore the helmholtz potential @xmath39 this system is perhaps the most interesting for applications , given the great amount of experimental data on binary fluid mixtures @xcite .",
    "however , the potential ( [ gibbs ] ) is not the most popular for fitting data ; a related form which has similar dependence on the relative concentration of the two fluids but is of van der waals type for the volume is usually considered instead .",
    "we believe that this form , which is much more difficult to analyze , gives essentially the same qualitative behavior .",
    "let us consider the reduced form of the gibbs potential obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) and dividing by @xmath40 , @xmath41 where now the new parameters @xmath42 are defined with respect to the old ones @xmath43 dividing them by @xmath44 . from the constraint eq.([cons ] ) , we build a new function @xmath22 of two variables such that @xmath45    the mean field theory prescription is then to minimize the _ non - equilibrium gibbs potential _ @xmath46 , @xmath47 with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to differences between the chemical potentials of the three components @xcite .",
    "ct will be applied to the @xmath52 function to classify the corank-2 singularities , at the generic point @xmath53 which moves on the triangle @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "ct conventionally uses the origin of coordinates as the point where singularities occur .",
    "therefore , we shall translate the function @xmath57 in order to have the singularities at the origin .",
    "this translated function is written now as @xmath58 and the germ of the unfolding @xmath21 is @xmath59 now according to the ct program proposed in our previous paper @xcite and mentioned in the introduction , the following steps will be developed for our problem :    1 .",
    "find conditions for which the origin of coordinates is a degenerate critical point of corank equal to 2 of @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   show that @xmath15 is equivalent to @xmath60 ( polynomial ) , shortly expressed as @xmath61 , which means that there is a diffeomorphism @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .",
    "the determinacy and codimension of @xmath15 will also be evaluated .",
    "3 .   find a canonical unfolding @xmath64 ( polynomial ) of @xmath60 by means of a basis of the vector space @xmath65 , which can be understood as the space of perturbations ( see appendix b ) .",
    "4 .   find a canonical 5-unfolding @xmath66 of @xmath15 .",
    "5 .   establish the @xmath16-transversality of @xmath21 and if it holds , then by using the main theorems about @xmath16-transversality , @xmath21 and @xmath66 will be isomorphic .",
    "now the first step is to write the conditions for which the origin of coordinates ( 0,0 ) is a degenerate critical point with corank equal to 2 of @xmath15 .",
    "this can be done by equating all the first and second partial derivatives of @xmath15 to zero at the point ( 0,0 ) ( hypothesis @xmath67)thus the hessian of the germ @xmath15 vanishes as well .",
    "this leads to five conditions among the variables and parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 . from that system of five equations",
    "the following relations can be extracted @xmath70 and @xmath71 with the definition @xmath72 .",
    "( [ tri1 ] ) give rise to a surface with parameters @xmath11 and @xmath73 fulfilling the condition for a degenerate critical point with corank 2 at @xmath74 ( fig .  2 ) .      with the hypothesis @xmath67 ,",
    "the 3-jet of @xmath15 ( taylor expansion truncated beyond terms of degree 3 ) around the point @xmath74 is @xmath75 this 3-jet can be considered now as a homogenous polynomial of degree equal to 3 and can be rewritten as @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we know from singularity theory that a general non - null homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 is equivalent by a linear transformation to one and only one of the following germs : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we must remark that these @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not to be identified with the initial physical variables though they are linearly related to them .",
    "the application of this lemma to eq .",
    "( [ cub ] ) to classify the 3-jet is given in appendix a and here only the final conclusions will be summarized :    1 .   if @xmath84 then @xmath85 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath86 then @xmath87 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath88 then @xmath89 .    all of these three cases can be collected in a plot shown in fig .  1 . in fig .  1 we display in the @xmath90 space the regions for the @xmath91 germs and in fig .",
    "2 the separatrices among regions with different codimensions in parameter space .",
    "the separatrix @xmath92 , say , in conjuction with the equations defining the instability surface ( [ tri1 ] ) gives rise to the plane @xmath93 , used in fig .  2 to find the separatrix in parameter space , which is a hyperbola branch .",
    "the equivalence between the 3-jet and the canonical germs implies that their codimensions are equal .",
    "thus we have that @xmath94 and we observe that the behavior of the codimension of the 3-jet is discontinuous according to fig .  1 .",
    "indeed , when the point @xmath53 crosses the inner triangle the codimension of the 3-jet jumps to infinity .",
    "the codimension is only finite when what we could call hypothesis @xmath95 is fulfilled , that is , @xmath96 on the contrary , if @xmath97 , corresponding to the sides of the inner triangle , the germ @xmath15 is not 3-determinate and we have to increase the order of its jet by one more degree to explore 4-determinacy .",
    "we have that @xmath98 where now the @xmath99-coefficients are found to be : @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 as before , in order to classify the 4-jet of @xmath15 we invoke again a lemma of the singularity theory ( see appendix a ) . in all of the subcases",
    "examined the 4-jet is equivalent to the canonical germ @xmath103 , it is 4-determinate and its codimension is equal to 4 .",
    "once we have shown that the 3-jet is equivalent to the canonical germs @xmath91 , and the 4-jet to @xmath103 , it is clear that as these germs are 3- and 4-determinate , the 3-jet and 4-jet will be also 3- and 4-determinate , respectively . then @xmath105 ( for @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) both with @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ( for @xmath97 ) but with @xmath111 .",
    "these equivalences exist up to an unknown change of coordinates , so that here and in the following the variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 have no physical interpretation and may be regarded as dummy variables .    to see that @xmath91 are 3-determinate and according to the main theorem about @xmath16-determinacy , it suffices to prove that @xcite @xmath112 which is easy ( for notation , see appendix b ) .",
    "the same can be proven for the 4-determinate case but in eq .",
    "( [ deter ] ) the exponent @xmath113 should be replaced by @xmath114 .",
    "it is well known from ct that @xmath115,[y],[x^2]\\}$ ] is a basis for the quotient vector spaces @xmath116 and @xmath117 and @xmath115,[y],[x^2],[y^2]\\}$ ] for @xmath118 . moreover , the @xmath16-transversal ( for all @xmath119 ) canonical unfolding of the canonical form @xmath80 ( _ elliptic umbilic _ , @xmath1 ) and its dual @xmath81 ( _ hyperbolic umbilic _ , @xmath0 ) and @xmath120 ( _ parabolic umbilic _ , @xmath2 ) are respectively @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath123    the corresponding bifurcation diagrams are well known in the singularity theory @xcite and can be seen in any of the standard books on this theory @xcite .",
    "equations governing such bifurcation diagrams are @xmath124 @xmath125 and @xmath126 which are obtained by equating to zero the first derivatives and hessian of @xmath15 in each case .      since @xmath21 has five parameters , the preceding unfoldings have to be extended with two or one irrelevant parameters in order to apply the isomorphy theorem .",
    "thus , for example , for the canonical unfoldings @xmath91 , the two new unfoldings denoted by @xmath127 and @xmath128 can be written as @xmath129 and @xmath130 and they are @xmath16-transversal unfoldings for all @xmath119 of @xmath131 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "now the new bifurcation sets are @xmath132 and @xmath133 .    in both cases",
    ", we can affirm that there is a change of coordinates ( a diffeomorphism ) @xmath134 such that @xmath135 and the same holds for @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , @xmath136 and @xmath137 where @xmath138 , is a 3-tranversal unfolding of @xmath15 with five parameters .",
    "moreover , for the bifurcation sets we have that @xmath139 and @xmath140 a similar reasoning can be used for the canonical unfolding @xmath141 but now we have only one irrelevant parameter .    finally , these canonical unfoldings of @xmath15 need to be related to the function @xmath21 or translated gibbs potential .",
    "this is shown explicitely in next subsection through the so - called transversality condition .",
    "now we return to the translated gibbs potential @xmath21 to establish its relation with the unfolding of @xmath15 studied above .",
    "the condition for the existence of this relation is its transversality . since we will be dealing with the physical function @xmath21",
    "its arguments will be the original physical variables , to be distiguished from the dummy variables used before .",
    "the vector space of the transversality , @xmath142 , is defined by the first partial derivatives of @xmath21 with respect to the five parameters according to @xmath143 where @xmath144 means all the linear combinations with real coefficients .",
    "let us analyze the transversality of the unfolding @xmath145 .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , this study is carried out in order to show that the function @xmath21 and the canonical unfolding of the germ @xmath15 are isomorphic .",
    "the vector space of the transversality , @xmath142 , is defined by eq.([trans ] ) and reads in our case @xmath146    our next step is to prove that @xmath21 is 3- or 4-transversal , according to each case . for this goal , we invoke one of the main theorems on @xmath16-transversality which states that @xmath21 will be @xmath16-transversal when the following algebraic condition is met @xcite @xmath147 which is fulfilled in our case for @xmath148 or @xmath114 .",
    "this requirement is proved in appendix c with the hypothesis @xmath67 and @xmath149 or @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "we finally conclude that @xmath21 is a 3- or 4-transversal unfolding of @xmath15 with five parameters .",
    "moreover , by using the main theorem on @xmath16-transversality , and for the 3-transversal case , @xmath150 and @xmath151 are isomorphic to @xmath21 , that is , there are three diffeomorphisms and a perturbation of parameters depending on @xmath53 for _ each case _ such that @xmath152 where the diffeomorphisms take the following expressions : @xmath153 with @xmath154 all of these diffeomorphisms preserve the origin of coordinates .",
    "moreover , concerning the bifurcations , we have that @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "similar expressions can be written for the 4-transversal case .",
    "the natural ( and oldest ) generalization of the ising model consists of taking a site variable which can take three equivalent states instead of two , constituting the three - state potts model .",
    "( similarly , one can define the @xmath157-state potts model . )",
    "it has complete permutation symmetry among the three states , yielding a gibbs potential corresponding to ( [ rgibbs ] ) with @xmath158 , fig .",
    "2 , leaving as the only parameter the temperature @xmath159 .",
    "the corank-2 instability occurs for @xmath160 and the correponding potential is the @xmath1 germ .",
    "the 3-parameter unfolding ( [ unfoldd-4 ] ) contains the possible perturbations of temperature or chemical potentials . since in the three - state potts model only the temperature perturbation is allowed we must have a one - parameter unfolding .",
    "its form is best deduced by symmetry arguments @xcite .",
    "we can substitute the germ by the symmetric form @xmath161 where we have introduced the complex variable @xmath162 .",
    "the permutation symmetry is obviously generated by the discrete rotations @xmath163 and the reflection @xmath164 .",
    "the temperature perturbation preserves the symmetry and belongs to the vector space @xmath165 .",
    "hence , it must be @xmath166 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the corresponding unfolding is @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a monotonic function of the temperature , at least , in a neighbourhood of @xmath169 .",
    "now there arises the problem that the unfolding ( [ 3punfold ] ) , being a section of the complete unfolding of @xmath1 , contains potentials with one minimum and three saddle points if @xmath170 or with one maximum and three saddle points if @xmath171 .",
    "these potentials are not bounded below nor have the three minima to be expected in this model .",
    "we must recall here the local character of ct and the discussion in @xcite .",
    "there we remarked that the global character of these potentials can only be established by a numerical study over the entire range of the variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus one finds that they indeed have three minima , far from the point @xmath74 and distributed symmetrically , if we keep the temperature in a neighbourhood of @xmath169 . for a large value of @xmath159 only the minimum at @xmath74 survives",
    "this is physically sensible , for at high temperature only the symmetric disordered phase can remain .",
    "the temperature @xmath169 precisely signals the point at which the symmetric disordered phase becomes unstable and disappears .",
    "potentials for various situations are plotted in fig .",
    "note that for @xmath172 the three minima converge to @xmath74 , eventually merging there .",
    "since their depth decreases as the depth of the minimum at @xmath74 increases , there must be a value of @xmath159 such that they are equal .",
    "if we adopt the maxwell convention then we have a first order phase transition .",
    "this phase transition is known to occur in this model in space dimension @xmath173 and almost certainly for @xmath174 @xcite . in @xmath175",
    "the phase transition is definitely of second order @xcite , which means that the mean - field theory potential with which we started is insufficient in low dimensions to describe accurately the real character of the possible phase transitions .",
    "landau potentials for the 3-state potts model that are bounded below have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "they are commonly derived by renormalization group ( rg ) arguments .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that for @xmath176 the only rg relevant term further from the cubic is the quartic symmetric term @xmath177 .",
    "it is even possible to prove with the powerful methods of @xmath178 conformal field theory that this term , in addition to the cubic term , constitute a well defined landau potential @xcite .",
    "so the potential @xmath179 seems to be adequate for this model .",
    "in fact , due to the addition of the quartic term , it exhibits the same behavior as the total non - polynomial potential displayed in fig .",
    "3 . in any event",
    ", we must remark that the quartic term does not belong to the germ , as calculated before .",
    "it could well arise from a more refined gibbs potential , namely , of the type obtained with cluster variation methods @xcite , especially if symmetry arguments are invoked like in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the possible modes of instability and further singularities of the mean - field theory gibbs potential for a three - component model in the case that two order parameters are needed for their description . since the case of one order parameter has been already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the study of this gibbs potential is now complete .",
    "we have found that three new catastrophes take place , namely , the _ hyperbolic umbilic _ , @xmath0 , its dual the _",
    "elliptic umbilic _ , @xmath1 , and the _ parabolic umbilic _ ,",
    "@xmath2 , catastrophes .",
    "parabolic umbilic _ has codimension 4 , which is the highest we can reach in the case of two control parameters , unlike the case of one control parameter studied in @xcite , where codimension five was reached .",
    "the germ and unfolding of the _ elliptic umbilic _ catastrophe are precisely ( isomorphic to ) those of the 3-state potts model , which is the model with the highest symmetry , and generally show three and even four phase coexistence . the total potential for the models belonging to the _ hyperbolic umbilic _ class do not have more than one local minimum and therefore they can not give rise to phase coexistence .",
    "the phase structure for the _ parabolic umbilic _ is fairly complicated and can be seen in any of the standard books about ct @xcite .",
    "finally , it is remarkable that with two order parameters the highest codimension 5 , which should give rise to even more complex singularities , is not reached .",
    "we must say a few words about natural generalizations . instead of limiting ourselves to three components we could well envisage the case of @xmath157 components .",
    "this would include most models ever considered in the physics of phase transitions .",
    "the most symmetric case is the @xmath157-state potts model .",
    "an essential advantage of increasing @xmath157 is that mean - field theory becomes more accurate  in fact becoming exact for space dimension @xmath180 if @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "a landau potential for the @xmath157-state potts model with @xmath182 order parameters is already known @xcite .",
    "presumably , the rigorous study of the highest corank instabilities of the @xmath157 component gibbs potential would produce a germ equal to the cubic term of that landau potential , as for the 3-state potts model .",
    "the corresponding singularities exhibit the interesting feature of having _ modular parameters _",
    "@xcite already for @xmath183 .",
    "there would certainly be a flock of other singularities with the same corank and the same or higher codimension , and with lower corank .",
    "we leave to the entrepreneurial reader the exploration of this endless world of mathematical entities and their physical application .",
    "this work has been supported by dgicyt - spain with grants pb96 - 0887 , pb96 - 0651-c03 - 01 and pb95 - 0071 .",
    "the application of the lemma of ct to eq.([cub ] ) to classify the 3-jet can be carried out in a systematic way considering the following subcases : + ( @xmath184 ) if @xmath185 ( that is , @xmath186 ) , then the auxiliary cubic equation of eq.([cub ] ) , obtained by dehomogenizing the polynomial , is given by @xmath187 its discriminant is defined as @xmath188 , where @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the roots of the cubic equation ( [ pol3 ] ) .",

    "therefore , this situation , which would lead to a different singularity with 3-jet @xmath238 , is actually outside the domain we consider .",

    "this comes from the fact that all the 4-degree monomials of the 4-jet ( [ j4 ] ) belong to the jacobian ideal of @xmath245 except precisely @xmath246 and therefore can be removed by a diffeomorphism . from the linear transformation eq .",

    "the corresponding auxiliary cubic equation is now@xmath256 the roots of this last equation are : @xmath257 and @xmath258 . with the linear transformation @xmath259 applied to the 4-jet",
    "we obtain that @xmath260 here the sign of @xmath261 is positive and therefore the 4-jet is again equivalent to the canonical germ @xmath103 , its codimension being again equal to 4 .",

    "@xmath266 and @xmath267 give to @xmath265 the estructure of a ring and @xmath268 is a maximal ideal of this ring .",
    "moreover , the operations @xmath266 and @xmath269 with @xmath270 give to @xmath265 the structure of a real vector space of dimension @xmath262 .",
    "the ideal @xmath271 is generated by @xmath5 , that is , @xmath272 . in general , if @xmath273 , we designate by @xmath274 the ideal generated by @xmath275 , that is , @xmath276 in particular , @xmath277 .",
    "it is possible to define powers of @xmath271 as @xmath278 .",
    "it can be proven that @xmath278 is equal to the ideal of @xmath265 generated by the monomials in @xmath279 of degree @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , for example , @xmath280 and @xmath281 we have also that @xmath282 where by @xmath283 we mean the derivative of degree @xmath284 .    now the main theorem about @xmath16-determinacy establishes a sufficient condition for a germ @xmath15 to be @xmath16-determinate .",
    "this condition reads @xmath285 and , in our case , it will be applied for @xmath286 and @xmath114 .",
    "the factor @xmath287 is known as the ideal of jacobi and is defined from the first partial derivatives of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath288 and @xmath289 , respectively ) .",
    "the calculation of this ideal is the general starting point to establish the determinacy and codimension of @xmath15 .",

    "analogously , we have that @xmath294    one is not always in the position to invoke a given lemma from ct to classify the germ and establish its @xmath16-determinacy . in what follows",
    "we illustrate how to proceed in the general case using the condition above ( [ kdeter ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath295 and therefore we have to prove that @xmath296 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\nu_2 [ \\frac{1}{2 } x^4 z_0^{-2 } + x^3 y\\ , z_0^{-2 } +   \\frac{1}{2 } x^2 y^2 n ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\nu_3 [ \\frac{1}{2 } x^2 y^2 m + x y^3 z_0^{-2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } y^4 z_0^{-2 } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\nu_4 [ \\frac{1}{2 } x^2 y^2 z_0^{-2 } + x y^3 z_0^{-2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } y^4 n ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\nu_5 [ \\frac{1}{2 } x^3 y\\ , m + x^2 y^2 z_0^{-2 } +   \\frac{1}{2 } x y^3 z_0^{-2 } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\nu_6 [ \\frac{1}{2 } x^3 y\\ , z_0^{-2 } + x^2 y^2 z_0^{-2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } x y^3 n ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and by equating coefficients of the same degree we obtain five equations relating the @xmath297 coefficients with the @xmath298 coefficients .",
    "this linear system of equations has solutions in @xmath299 only if the hypothesis @xmath95 is fulfilled , eq.([sigma1 ] ) .    under these conditions , the germ and the 3-jet of the germ are equivalent , @xmath300 and @xmath301 , that is , the dimension of the quotient vector space associated by the ideal of jacobi of the 3-jet .",
    "moreover , it can be also proved that @xmath115,[y],[x^2]\\}$ ] is a basis of that quotient vector space .",
    "similarly , alternative basis can also be @xmath115,[y],[y^2]\\}$ ] or @xmath115,[y],[x^2 + y^2]\\}$ ] .",
    "as has been mentioned above we need to show that @xmath21 is 3-transversal ( similar calculations are needed in order to show that for the hypothesis @xmath97 , @xmath21 is 4-transversal ) .",
    "one of the main theorems about transversality establishes that this property is fulfilled when @xmath302 the ideal of jacobi of @xmath15 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ijg ] ) and the vector space @xmath142 by eq.([vh ] ) .    in eq.([ijg ] ) , the ideal of jacobi of @xmath15 contains monomials of degree greater than 2 .",
    "we are going to show that monomials of degree equal to 3 belong to @xmath303 .",
    "thus we have that @xmath304 and the linear system of equations obtained from equating coefficients of the same degree has solutions in @xmath305 and @xmath306 if @xmath149 .    on the other hand ,",
    "a straightforward consequence of what we have shown above is that @xmath307 so finally we can rewrite the transversality condition as @xmath308 in other words , we have to find a set of @xmath298-parameters fulfilling @xmath309 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\nu_7 \\,[\\frac{1}{2 } x^2 \\alpha_0^{-2 } + x y \\alpha_0^{-2 } +   \\frac{1}{2 } y^2 n ]   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again by equating coefficients of the same degree we obtain a set of equations between the family of known @xmath297 and unknown @xmath298 parameters .",
    "the corresponding system of equations has a matrix of rank equal to 5 and the transversality condition is fulfilled .",
    "for the 4-transversal case , the procedure is entirely similar .",
    "only the following observation needs to be made .",
    "monomials of degree 1 and 2 are included in the vector space of transversality and monomials of degree 5 and higher are considered in the term @xmath310 .",
    "so the equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ con4 ] ) has to take into account monomials of degree 3 and 4 .",
    "this leads to a system of nine equations and ten unknown parameters .",
