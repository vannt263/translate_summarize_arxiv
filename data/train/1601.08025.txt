    "samples in the unit ball , the dual process has previously featured as a parabolic growth process @xcite .",
    "second , we establish a qualitative link with scaling transforms used previously for different models of random polytopes ; see remark ( ii ) below and section 4.1 .",
    "lastly , the transform suitably re - scales the _ floating bodies _ for @xmath0 , showing that their re - scaled images play a central role in the re - scaled convex hull geometry .",
    "floating bodies usefully approximate random polytopes , as in @xcite , but here we show that their re - scaled images also play a key role in asymptotic analysis .",

    "the situation with @xmath0 a unit ball involves quantitative differences and similarities .",

    "roughly speaking , the obstruction to finding a global scaling transform goes as follows .",
    "the transform given here , like those in @xcite , relies on the construction of a one - parameter family of @xmath79-dimensional surfaces interior to @xmath0 ( boundaries of associated floating bodies for @xmath0 ) , in which the height coordinate is a function of the corresponding parameter and the space coordinate is given by a mapping from a subset of @xmath57 to the surface belonging to the one - parameter family .",
    "it is in general difficult to construct a global mapping from @xmath57 to a @xmath79-dimensional manifold , and thus difficult to find a global scaling transform .",
    ".2 cm ( v ) _ approximate additivity of the variance_. the lack of a global scaling transform necessitates showing that @xmath80 and @xmath18 are well approximated by the sum of variances of contributions arising from small neighborhoods around each vertex of @xmath0 .",

    "these non - trivial technical obstacles are not present when @xmath0 is the unit ball @xcite . .2 cm ( vi ) _ extension to general polytopes_. the fundamental work of brny and buchta @xcite shows that the extreme points of a general polytope @xmath0 concentrate in regions defined by each flag of @xmath0 .",
    "these ` flag regions ' , themselves simple polytopes , could individually be treated by the methods of this paper . if one could show ( a ) negligibility of covariances of contributions to @xmath11 and @xmath15 arising from input on distinct flag regions as well as",
    "( b ) negligibility of contributions to @xmath11 and @xmath15 arising from input on the complements of flag regions , then variance would be additive with respect to flags .",
    "this would extend our results to general polytopes and it would align our second order results with the first order results of @xcite , which shows that expectation asympotics are additive with respect to flags .",
    "however showing additivity of variance with respect to flags seems to be a separate project which would either require a scaling transform more general than @xmath43 or a non - trivial extension of the methods of section 3 .",
