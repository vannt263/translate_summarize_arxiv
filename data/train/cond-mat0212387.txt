    "our study of long - wavelength vibrational excitations starts with the continuum version of the equations of motion of a set of harmonically bound atoms , which reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the force constant matrices and @xmath56 is the displacement vector of atom @xmath27 for a vibrational mode of energy @xmath57 .",
    "we introduce mass and atomic density functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the position of atom @xmath27 . the continuum version that substitutes eq.([eq : discrete ] ) is then given by @xmath62 where we made the usual assumption that the force constant matrix depends on coordinate differences only .",

    "these functions are described by a series of very sharp peaks at values given by the reciprocal lattice vectors . disordered or amorphous materials do not produce these sharp peaks with the exception of the @xmath68 maximum which is not related to spatial order .",
    "one can assume that some of the salient features of eq.([eq : ftcontinuum ] ) are captured by retaining the @xmath68 maximum only , i.e. , we approximate @xmath69 where @xmath29 and @xmath70 are the average mass and volume per atom . equation ( [ eq : ftcontinuum ] ) simplifies to @xmath71 and describes a class of solutions that should be common for all harmonic solids .",

    "we note that @xmath73 follows from the invariance of the vibrational energy with respect to a displacement identical for all atoms . assuming that the force - constant matrix falls off sufficiently fast with distance an expansion of eq.([eq : scontinuum ] ) in powers of @xmath74 is permissible .",

    "<S> the standard approach to learn about the composition and structure of the earth s interior entails measurements of sound velocities of candidate compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the results are then compared to seismological data to exclude or confirm a particular compound . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will describe the use of nuclear resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( nrixs ) to measure the velocity of sound .    </S>",
    "<S> the nrixs method was introduced to probe the lattice dynamics of materials by employing low - energy nuclear resonances .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in nrixs experiments , only signals from nuclear resonance absorption are monitored , and for this reason the extracted quantity is specific to the resonant isotope . </S>",
    "<S> this technique provides the phonon excitation spectrum as seen by the probe nuclei ,  @xcite and in most cases one can extract the partial vibrational frequency distribution , a function often referred to as the partial phonon density of states ( pdos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nrixs method has been applied to various materials , e.g. , thin films and multilayers ,  @xcite nanoparticles ,  @xcite crystals with impurities ,  @xcite organic molecules ,  @xcite proteins ,  @xcite samples under high pressures ,  @xcite and samples of geophysical interests .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite most of these samples are compounds , and , while the obtained pdos gives only part of the lattice dynamics , the low - energy portion of the pdos provides the debye sound velocity of the whole sample . </S>",
    "<S> we will now show that , due to universal features of acoustic modes of harmonic solids , the low - energy portion of the pdos is related to the debye sound velocity in a simple way .    </S>",
    "<S> the normalized phonon density of states is defined by @xmath0 where the energy eigenstates of lattice vibrations @xmath1 are labeled by quantum number @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the total number of atoms in the solid . in the harmonic lattice approximation , </S>",
    "<S> a pdos , which is more relevant to nrixs experiments , is given by  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 enumerates resonant nuclei , @xmath6 is the total number of resonant nuclei , @xmath7 is a unit vector in the incident photon direction , and @xmath8 are phonon polarization vectors . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : pdos ] ) shows that the vibrational polarizations are projected onto the incident photon direction and in particular the vibrational modes with polarization perpendicular to the direction of the incident photon do not contribute . in the case of a single crystal , </S>",
    "<S> the measured vibrational properties become dependent on the incident photon direction and were called `` projected , ''  @xcite whereas in cases of polycrystalline or isotropic samples , the measured spectrum is an average over all directions . for a crystal in which resonant nuclei occupy only equivalent lattice sites , the quantity that can be extracted from nrixs experiments is exactly described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pdos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the resonant nuclei occupy different sites , what can be extracted is an approximation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pdos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation is based on an average of phonon spectra for these different lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> the closure conditions of the phonon polarization vectors guarantee the normalization of @xmath9 , i.e. , its integration over all phonon energies is one . </S>",
    "<S> the orthonormality and closure conditions are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote the spatial components . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions hold for any harmonic solid , and the polarization vectors have to be specified for every atom in the solid , in contrast to the crystal case , where they can be reduced to a much smaller set for atoms in one unit cell only . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation of @xmath13 from @xmath14 is contained in the behavior of the phonon polarization vectors @xmath15 and can be expressed in terms of a modulating function , @xmath16 which we now determine for low - energy vibration modes .    in a crystal , </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic modes form three branches described by phonon momentum . for disordered solids </S>",
    "<S> , we still expect hydrodynamic modes on length scales that are large compared to length scales characterized by inhomogeneities in the material . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the properties of such hydrodynamic modes . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that linearly dispersing plane - wave modes exist on long length scales , and that these modes are described by momentum @xmath17 and branch number @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> energies and atomic displacements associated with these modes take the following form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the sound velocity , @xmath21 is a normalized polarization vector , and @xmath22 are the atomic positions . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization factor @xmath23 can be determined as follows . for a normal mode @xmath2 with energy @xmath1 , </S>",

    "<S> a comparison with eq.([eq : disp ] ) under consideration of the normalization condition eq.([eq : otho ] ) results in @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the average atomic mass . for the low - energy , hydrodynamic modes , </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore write @xmath30    in the small @xmath31 , low - energy regime , we rewrite eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : pdos ] ) to obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the nuclear resonant isotope , and the debye velocity @xmath35 is defined as an average over all sound velocities @xmath36 we see that for small energies , the modulating function becomes energy independent . </S>",
    "<S> if we define a projected sound velocity similarly by @xmath37 we obtain the simple relationship @xmath38 for an isotropic sample , the sound velocity does not have directional dependence , and we can further simplify eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : debyevel ] ) and ( [ eq : paravel ] ) to identify @xmath39 . in the case of a polycrystalline sample , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : chiave ] ) and ( [ eq : debye ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , eq .  ( [ eq : debyepdos ] ) shows the dependence of the modulation function on the photon direction for anisotropic samples . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite it is identical to @xmath44 for isotopically pure samples , for which the pdos becomes total dos . here </S>",

    "<S> the pdos of a variety of samples has been measured by nrixs . here </S>",
    "<S> we show three examples representing crystals ( bcc iron , hematite ) and materials with point defects ( @xmath45pd@xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crystalline samples are translationally invariant , and thus for them the basis of modes is in fact given by momentum eigenstates with polarization vectors which are known to obey eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pol ] ) explicitly .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite while the point - defect case is expressly not translationally invariant , by using the lattice green s function technique , it is still possible to find closed form expressions for the polarization vectors , with eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : chiave ] )  and  ( [ eq : debye ] ) again being found to follow . </S>",
    "<S> we shall describe the details of this specific calculation elsewhere ,  @xcite while noting here that the modulation to the low - energy part of host lattice dos is found to depend only on the mass ratio even in the event of a force constant change at the defect site .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the low - energy region of the pdos divided by energy squared is displayed for the three samples in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> bcc iron 95%  enriched in  is an example of the limiting case where @xmath47 , and nrixs provides the total rather than the partial dos . </S>",
    "<S> hematite enriched with  represents a situation , in which the resonant nuclei form only a part of the unit cell . the @xmath45pd@xmath46 sample approaches another limiting case in which the nuclear resonant isotopes occupy only a very small portion of lattice sites . in this limit , @xmath48 , the average atomic mass @xmath29 in the above equations </S>",
    "<S> is well approximated by the mass of a host lattice atom , and the sound velocity obtained is that of the pure host , rather than of the host / impurity system . </S>",
    "<S> these samples thus represent a very broad range of nuclear resonant isotope concentrations .    </S>",
    "<S> pd@xmath46 , 0.6mev for @xmath49o@xmath50 , and 1mev for bcc iron . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ]    we extracted numerical values for the velocities of sound by averaging @xmath51 obtained from measured data in the region from zero to 5mev according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : debye ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are tabulated in table  [ tbl : vc ] , where we also compare our values with sound velocities from other sources as explained in the footnotes of the table . for iron and palladium , </S>",
    "<S> the results from nrixs measurements are within the range of sound velocities that were obtained by other means . in the case of hematite , </S>",
    "<S> our results give clearly a lower value for @xmath35 than is obtained from the measured elastic constants . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult for us to judge the reliability of values for @xmath35 obtained by other methods that usually do not measure @xmath35 directly but rely on post - experimental data averaging . </S>",
    "<S> values obtained with the nrixs method seem to be lower or on the lower end of ranges given by other authors </S>",
    "<S> . this might be due to the fact that the phonon spectrum up to 5mev ( corresponding to a frequency of 1.2thz ) is used to derive the sound velocity . at such high frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> the phonon dispersion may already be nonlinear , which would typically lead to a reduction in the value of the obtained @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> improvements in energy resolution could make smaller phonon energies accessible , which would potentially provide a better measure of sound velocity .    .[tbl </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : chiave ] )  and  ( [ eq : debye ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have relied critically on the assumption of debye behavior at small phonon energies . in particular , we require debye behavior to extrapolate to typical sound frequencies ( @xmath53hz ) from the thz range , which is accessible to nrixs . however , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we see deviations from debye behavior , which would correspond to a horizontal line . besides nonlinearities in the phonon dispersion as mentioned above , the removal of the elastic contributions to the nrixs spectra can be a source of systematic uncertainties .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also the nrixs technique relies on harmonic behavior of the sample to extract the pdos from the measured data .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite all these possibilities may contribute to the deviations seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in future studies aimed at low - frequency dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest measuring the resolution function simultaneously by nuclear forward scattering to improve the reliability of peak substraction . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , a highly accurate resolution function should be available . besides the peak - subtraction procedure and the energy resolution ( usually defined as fwhm ) , the shape of the resolution function is also of major importance . </S>",
    "<S> the access to small excitation energies is greatly improved if the tails of the resolution function can be minimized by design of the x - ray monochromator .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , difficulties in the peak removal usually become more severe with increasing ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering intensities . in many cases , the relative strength of the elastic scattering </S>",
    "<S> is reduced by saturation effects in the sample .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this highly desirable effect is less pronounced for samples with low concentrations of the resonant isotope or in cases of generally weak inelastic scattering , e.g. , at very low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the special requirements for data collection near the elastic peak , an accurate measurement of the entire spectrum is equally important to achieve an accurate normalization .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that nuclear resonant isotopes can be used to measure the sound velocity of a solid in the context of the harmonic approximation and debye - like low - frequency dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is valid even for very low concentrations of the nuclear resonant isotope , and therefore the probing nuclei provide information about the host lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the presented method will have significant impact in the scientific area of high - pressure research and , in particular , in the field of geophysics , where sound velocity is of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> also the strategic placement of resonant nuclei in artificial structures may provide insight into local atomic motion , which at low energies is thought to influence the electronic noise in nanostructure devices . </S>",
    "<S> thus nrixs opens another venue to measure sound velocities of solids and can complement other techniques or even supercede established methods in those cases where they become too demanding or even impossible .    </S>",
