    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) describes a two - level atom interacting with a single - mode radiation field . because it is a soluble fully quantum mechanical model , the jcm has been attracting many researchers attention since it was proposed in 1963 @xcite . considering the hamiltonian for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field , assuming near resonance and applying the rotating - wave approximation to it",
    ", we obtain the hamiltonian of the jcm .",
    "thus , the jcm is suitable for describing interaction of the radiation with the matter , for example , the spontaneous emission given rise to by a single two - level atom in the cavity field .",
    "if we put the single - mode field into the state with sharply defined photon number at initial time , the jcm causes the rabi oscillations in the atomic population inversion .",
    "moreover , if we put the field into the coherent state initially , the jcm shows the collapse and the revival of the rabi oscillations . because the classical theory can not explain the revival of the rabi oscillations , we can regard it as an evidence of the quantum nature of the radiation , that is , the discreteness of photons @xcite .",
    "however , in the case where we prepare the single - mode field in a thermal state initially , we hardly predict how the system evolves . because of the thermal fluctuation of the field , the bloch vector develops in time in a confusing manner .",
    "both its norm and direction change hard at random , so that it seems to be in disorder .",
    "a number of researchers analyze this problem in details and try to find distinct properties , which characterize its unpredictable behaviour .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , von foerster computes time evolution of the probability for finding the atom in the ground state with preparing the radiation field into various states at initial time .",
    "knight and radmore investigate both the thermal jcm and its corresponding semiclassical model @xcite .",
    "they compare time evolution of the atomic population inversion of the quantum model with that of the semiclassical model by plotting their graphs numerically . in ref .",
    "@xcite , knight analyzes the time - dependence of the atomic inversion of the jcm with an initial field state in thermal equilibrium . in the work , he states the following observation : the thermal fluctuation causes the collapse of the rabi oscillations and their collapse time is very short . in addition",
    ", the revival overlaps it , so that interference occurs and it generates a very irregular time evolution .",
    "liu and tombesi discuss thermodynamics of the jcm @xcite . in their analysis ,",
    "the grand partition function of both the atom and the boson field is considered .",
    "when we discuss the thermal jcm , we have to handle an intractable infinite series .",
    "if the single - atom field is resonant with the atom , the @xmath6th term of this intractable infinite series is given by a trigonometric function of @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath3 represents the variable of the time .",
    "buck and sukumar emphasize this fact in ref .",
    "@xcite . because the infinite series is a superposition of the trigonometric function of @xmath7 for @xmath8 and it can not be a fourier series , the value of the sum of the series varies in an unpredictable manner as the time @xmath3 progresses .",
    "arroyo - correa and sanchez - mondragon try to discuss the thermal jcm and evaluate the atomic population inversion , which is described by this intractable infinite series , using a technique of the complex analysis @xcite .",
    "et al_. examine a new analytical approach to obtain an approximate sum of this series , which is reliable for a small initial mean photon number @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , klimov and chumakov rewrite this intractable infinite series as a sum of two integrals by using the abel - plana formula .    not only the thermal fluctuation but also a continuous measurement lets the jcm exhibit chaotic behaviour . fukuo _ et al_. study time evolution of non rotating - wave approximation jcm under a continuous quantum - nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite . counting the number of photons inside the cavity with the qnd photodetector",
    ", the system evolves in an irreversible way and yields chaos .    in this paper",
    ", we study the time evolution of the bloch vector governed by the thermal jcm .",
    "preparing the atom and the single - mode field initially in a certain pure state and a mixed state with a bose - einstein photon number distribution respectively , we let the whole system develop according to the jcm hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the system never suffers from dissipation . as mentioned before , under these circumstances",
    ", the behaviour of the bloch vector is thrown into disorder . in this paper , taking a different viewpoint compared with ones that we have been used to , we investigate quasiperiodicity of the bloch vector s trajectories . using the concept of the quasiperiodicity , we can explain the confused behaviour of the system as an intermediate state between periodic and chaotic motions .",
    "the revealed quasiperiodic structures hidden in the thermal fluctuation of the bloch vector have close relations with topics of the number theory , which is one of the oldest branches of the pure mathematics .",
    "this appearance of unexpected natures of the thermal jcm itself is our motivation for this work .    in the current paper , we discuss the following three facts :    * we draw an analogy between the dynamics of the bloch vector and that of a compressible fluid .",
    "we show that the time evolution of the bloch vector is equivalent to a compressible inviscid flow that has no vorticity . *",
    "if we adjust the time displacement @xmath0 properly , figures consisting of plotted dots at the constant interval @xmath0 acquire scale invariance under replacement of @xmath0 by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary real but not transcendental number .",
    "this fact is derived by making use of the weyl criterion , which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence of real numbers to be uniformly distributed modulo unity .",
    "* we can compute values of the time variable @xmath3 , which let @xmath4 ( the absolute value of the @xmath5-component of the bloch vector ) be very small , with the diophantine approximation ( a rational approximation of an irrational number ) .    in ref .",
