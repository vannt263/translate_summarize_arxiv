    "the fate of living cells is regulated through interactions with other cells and with the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) . through receptor - ligand bonds formed by specific proteins the cell adheres to the ecm forming adhesion domains ( clusters of closed bonds ) .",

    "focal adhesions are involved in the transmission of signals and mechanical forces , and play key roles in cell anchorage and migration  @xcite .",
    "consequently , understanding how adhesion domains form , and the factors that control their size , shape , and growth  @xcite , is of profound practical importance .",
    "extensive studies have been performed on theoretical models for single bond dynamics  @xcite , collective dynamics of discrete bonds  @xcite , and employing effective potentials  @xcite ; as well as experimentally on cell - mimetic model systems  @xcite such as lipid bilayer vesicles with embedded ligands brought in the vicinity of receptors tethered to supported membranes  @xcite .",

    "( b )  an analogous _ in vitro _",
    "example in which the pinning sites are formed by stiff and permanently closed bonds ( tethers ) between membrane and substrate . ]",
    "while theoretical models predict a macroscopic phase separation , adhesion domains in cells are typically finite in size .",
    "it has been proposed that trapping in membrane corrals ( or compartments ) reduces the mobility of receptors  @xcite , which becomes a limiting factor for the growth of adhesion domains .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative explanation based on the observation that , due to the interactions with the ecm , membrane height fluctuations are locally suppressed .",
    "these `` pinning sites '' induce quenched disorder of the _ random - field _ type which prevents macroscopic domain formation in @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "hence , based on the fundamentals of statistical physics alone , adhesion domains of finite size are implied in a wide variety of contexts .",
    "the mere presence of random - field disorder provides a robust mechanism controlling the size of adhesion domains , irrespective of the details of the many and complex molecular processes between cell and ecm .",

    "the minimum of the non - specific potential is thus taken to be the reference height from which @xmath2 is measured .",
    "these non - specific interactions arise due to volume exclusion , van der waals forces , and the possible formation of an electrostatic double layer , as well as an effective pressure due to the restricted volume the membrane can move in .    the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 define a length , @xmath8 , which sets the scale over which the membrane height fluctuations are correlated  @xcite , @xmath9 see appendix  [ sec : corr ] .",

    "the physical picture is that , since the membrane is pinned to the minimum of the non - specific potential @xmath98 , closed bonds can not `` pull down '' the membrane as easily as before .",
    "this impedes the above mentioned facilitation of bond formation due to undulations , and consequently the effective chemical potential is reduced .",
    "choosing a sufficiently negative @xmath99 , the opposite situation of an increased local chemical potential may also be realized .",
    "we typically consider a low pinning density @xmath100 , such that @xmath92 effectively becomes a binary random variable with values @xmath101 . in this limit",

    "nevertheless , given that an infinitesimally weak random - field is sufficient to destroy macroscopic domain formation in two dimensions  @xcite , we expect that even a low pinning density will drastically affect adhesion domain formation",
    ". finally , note that in addition to the dominant random - field disorder , the pinning sites also induce a marginal perturbation .",

    "note that our composite move is ergodic , and thus by itself constitutes a valid mc algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , we still found it useful to also implement the non - composite variant , whereby the membrane height is updated without changing the corresponding bond variable . in terms of the composite move above , this corresponds to @xmath136 , while in step ( 2 ) the bond variable @xmath109 is not changed . in",
