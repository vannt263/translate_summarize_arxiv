    "to achieve the design luminosity of @xmath5 in operation an ongoing effort of improvement is necessary . as part of this process",
    "new design options are explored and their effect on the design parameters studied .",
    "no individual option improves every single aspect of the machine and therefore all solutions have to be carefully compared and the solution with the overall best performance chosen .",
    "part of this work is the study of unwanted effects , developing methods to compensate these and possibly test them in operating facilities .",
    "based on these results design specifications and tolerances are developed .",
    "we report on the latest results of these efforts .",
    "in december 2010 the italian ministry for education , university and research approved the superb project  @xcite . with this decision",
    "the project enters a new stage .",
    "the current conceptual design has been published in @xcite .",
    "the campus tor vergata near rome , italy was chosen as site for the facility .",
    "this was officially announced at the xvii superb workshop and kick off meeting in la biodola ( isola delba ) italy from 28 may 2011 to 02 june 2011 . on october 7@xmath6",
    "the laboratory nicola cabibbo was offically launched .",
    "the new international center for fundamental and applied physics is located on the campus of rome tor vergate in italy and will host the superb collider . the next goal is to deliver the engineering design report within the next year .",
    "design construction has started .",
    "all calculations discussed in this paper and @xcite are based on the design parameters as summarized in table [ parameters ] .",

    "there are currently two designs under consideration for the interaction region layout .",
    "one bases its design on vanadium permendur panofsky quadrupoles for qd0 and qf1 for both rings ( `` russian '' design ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ russianir ] .",
    "the second utilizes superconducting air coils for qd0 and qf1 ( `` italian '' design ) .",
    "in addition a portion of the her qd0 is laid out as vanadium permendur panofsky quadrupole .",
    "both solutions show good behavior for synchrotron radiation backgrounds and beam apertures . with respect to the detector solenoid compensation",
    "the latter option provides better compensation possibilities for both rings as different angles for qd0 and qf1 of her and ler is the optimum solution .      for the qd0 design a prototype of the superconducting `` italian ''",
    "design is being built .",
    "the quadrupole will have a magnetic length of 30 cm and a gradient of 96 t / m and an inner bore radius of 2 cm .",
    "critical aspects are the small space available for the sc wire and the thermal stabilization material ( cu+al ) , and the small margin to quench .",
    "the prototype will help in determining the maximum gradient achievable at 4.2k and the field quality at room temperature .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ qd0 ] for a sketch of the magnet .",
    "the aluminum structure supporting the superconducting wire has been constructed and a test winding installed in it as shown in fig .",
    "[ qd0_a ] .          over the past year",
    "two alternative arc cells have been developed .",
    "three different versions for the her arc cell were designed : v12 is the current version , v13 was modified to improve chromatic behavior and v14 to reduce the ring circumference .",
    "the major driver were the optimization of emittance , dynamic aperture , reduction of chromaticity for version 13 and reduction of ring circumference for version 14 .",
    "the parameters for these new lattices are summarized in @xcite .",
    "a detailed description for both solutions is given in @xcite .",
    "the detector solenoid has a strong 1.5 t field in the ir area , and its tails extend over the range of several meters .",
    "the coupling of the horizontal and vertical betatron motion needs to be corrected in order to preserve the small design beam size at the interaction point .",
    "additional complications are : ( 1 ) the solenoid is not parallel to either of the two beams due to the crossing angle leading to orbit and dispersion perturbations . ( 2 )",
    "the solenoid overlaps the innermost ir permanent quadrupoles causing additional coupling effects .",
    "the proposed correction system provides local compensation of the solenoid effects independently for each side of the ir .",
    "it includes bucking solenoids to remove the unwanted longitudinal solenoid field tails and a set of skew quadrupoles , dipole correctors and ante - solenoids to cancel all linear perturbations to the optics .",
    "the details of the correction system design are presented in @xcite .",
    "the ultra low vertical emittances in superb rings need a very careful procedure of emittance tuning , including the study of the maximum tolerable magnet errors ( such as misalignments , tilts , bpm errors ) . to minimize the vertical emittance an orbit and dispersion as well as coupling and @xmath14-beating free steering routine has been developed .",
    "the efficiency of this routine has been studied for the superb lattices with madx .",
    "the results were presented in @xcite . the superb final focus ( ff )",
    "introduces stringent restrictions on alignment of both ff and arcs . to test the applicability of this method beam studies",
    "were conducted in late 2010 at the diamond light source . in this test",
    "the vertical emittance correction was compared to the standard method using loco .",
    "these studies are still ongoing and preliminary results were presented in @xcite .      to establish a `` vibration budget ''",
    "an ongoing study investigates the effects of on beam sensitivity to dynamic misalignments .",
    "the major sources for these are expected to be the vibration of the ir cryostat . to confirm this the effects of ground motion as originally measured at lnf and later on the tor vergate site and the vibration of arc quadrupoles",
    "have been compared to the results for both sites .",
    "the results of the tor vergate site are favorable compared to the lnf site which contributed to the site choice .",
    "for this investigation ground motion measurements at lnf site at frascati and tor vergata , vibration measurement at the sld detector at slac are combined with theoretical modeling . to establish the budget a maximum allowed orbit displacement at the interaction point reducing the luminosity",
    "is defined .",
    "the preliminary results are summarized in table [ vibration ] .",
    ".super - b proposed vibration budget . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ parameter3 ]    the brightness for the undulator radiation",
    "is depicted in figure [ f22 ] .",
    "pepx generates the highest brightness followed by her and ler .",
    "this is a result of the high beam currents in these rings .",
    "a detailed study of the difference of source point parameter and its effect on the brightness between pepx and the super - b rings by considering the photon beam diffraction limit showed that the higher brightness in pepx is generated by its lower horizontal emittance .",
    "a brief study to optimize the brightness in the her was conducted , the result is plotted in figure  [ f3 ] . by reducing the her energy and beam coupling ( from design 0.25% to 0.1% ) the beam emittance is reduced .",
    "this gain is unfortunately mostly canceled by the change of the diffraction limit as the calculation show , since to achieve the same level of brightness as in pepx the horizontal emittance would have to be significantly reduced .          when using the super - b rings as a synchrotron light source one has to plan for additional space for the photon beam lines and user space .",
    "this is significant as collider facilities are usually located underground for radiation protection purposes whereas third generation light sources are surface installations .      during the study the lnf site near rome was the primary choice",
    "this site demands an underground installation as the surface area is already mostly occupied .",
    "in addition the ring dimensions partially exceed the lnf boundaries .",
    "this investigation was aimed to understand where and with what length photon beam lines could be placed within the lnf boundary .",
    "an overview is shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "it shows the planned super - b tunnels with injector .",
    "added to these are the contour lines with distances from the source point in 25 meter steps to a maximum of 150 meters . only bend magnet source points from the outer ring were used .",
    "the upper portion of beam lines originate from the ler the lower from the her .",
    "figure [ f5 ] is a magnification of the lower left area .",
    "as the picture indicates a set of her beam lines with different length could be located there completely within lnf boundaries .",
    "the same contour line legend of fig.[f4 ] applies .          with the decission in favour for the tor vergate site the space constraints discussed in the previous section are relaxed",
    "this site is located about 4 kilometers from the original area of lnf .",
    "the preliminary results of the ground motion measurements show less activity at this site .",
    "a first scetch of the accelerator design at tor vergata as originaly planned for the lnf site is shown in fig .",
    "[ torvergata ] .",
    "with the approval by the italian government the project is moving from the conceptual to the technical design phase . with the establishing of the laboratory nicola cabibbo at the campus tor vergata as the future site of the superb facility",
    "a large step has been taken towards the realization .",
    "the collaboration with other funding agencies , through mou , is in its final phase .",
    "construction plans will follow soon ."
