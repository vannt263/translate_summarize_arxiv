    "there are several systematic effects that could skew the measurement of @xmath7 , however all appear to be well controlled in our experiment .",
    "the effects that we analyze are magnetic field fluctuation , magnetic field gradients , ac zeeman effect , and 60 hz jitter .    because neither experimental apparatus employs magnetic shielding",
    ", fluctuating ambient magnetic field is the most important systematic effect .",
    "we are aware of several sources for this error .",
    "the largest is due to the public transit system in close proximity to the experiments .",
    "large unbalanced currents powering electric buses transiently change the magnetic field in the laboratory .",
    "additionally , we have observed magnetic field drifts as magnetized objects in the laboratory slowly relax .    to quantify this effect , we proceeded in two directions .",
    "since the ground state splitting , @xmath28 , is proportional to the magnetic field , any change in the ambient field would change the resonant splitting . by repeating the measurement of @xmath28",
    ", we can observe any fluctuations in the magnetic field .",
    "doing so , we find that the magnetic field fluctuates randomly by approximately 180 @xmath5 g over a 5 minute period for the  blade \" setup .",
    "this appears as an uncertainty in @xmath7 of @xmath43 .",
    "additionally , we installed a three - axis fluxgate magnetometer near the  rod \" trap and monitored the magnetic field while data was being collected .",
    "we find that the largest drift over the course of a measurement of the zeeman resonance ( approximately 400 s ) corresponds to a 20 @xmath5 g drift in the ambient field resulting in a conservative systematic error of @xmath44 to each measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "since the magnetic field fluctuates randomly , multiple measurements will reduce this error .",
    "any fast fluctuations of the magnetic field will result in broadening of the zeeman resonance line shape .",
    "a magnetic field gradient could also affect this measurement if the ion were to shift its position over the course of the experiment . to check this",
    ", we measured the ground state resonance , @xmath28 , at two positions along the trap axis separated by 26 @xmath5 m .",
    "the observed change in the resonance frequency corresponded to a change in the magnetic field of 360 @xmath5 g , indicating a 0.14 g / cm gradient .",
    "however , we find that during a single experiment , the ion does not change its position by more than 1 @xmath5 m , placing an upper limit of @xmath45 on the systematic uncertainty of @xmath7 .    presence of trapping rf voltages may cause an ac - zeeman effect that would perturb the resonance frequencies of the ground and excited states differently .",
    "this effect may manifest itself either because the ion exhibits enhanced micromotion and oscillates at @xmath46 along a magnetic field gradient or due to an ac current at @xmath46 produced by the trapping electrodes , which would produce an oscillating magnetic field at the ion .",
    "either of these ac - zeeman effects depend on the amplitude of the rf voltage that drives the trap .",
    "measuring @xmath7 at vastly different trap rf voltages , we find that an ac - zeeman effect does not result in a statistically significant shift . the measurements at low ( high ) trap rf voltage are plotted in blue ( red ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmeas ] . we can place a fractional error of @xmath47 on this effect .",
    "lastly , the experiment is triggered at a specific phase of the ac line voltage .",

    "using precision rf spectroscopy , we have measured the land @xmath0 factor of the @xmath1 level of @xmath2ba@xmath3 to be 1.200  367@xmath49 in the  rod \" apparatus and 1.200  388@xmath50 in the  blade \" apparatus .",
    "these independent measurements combine to yield a value of 1.200  371@xmath6 .",
    "the reduced @xmath51 of these 10 measurements was found to be 0.7 .",
    "this measurement offers a factor of 70 reduction in statistical uncertainty from the previous measurement @xcite and is , to our knowledge , the most accurate measurement to date .",
    "it should be noted that our group s previous result @xcite disagrees with this new measurement by more than 3.5-@xmath35 . the value in @xcite is heavily shifted by a couple of outlying data points , which were included for completeness .",
    "we reanalyzed this data , removing the outliers , and find a result of 1.2004(5 ) , which is consistent with the improved measurement reported here .",
