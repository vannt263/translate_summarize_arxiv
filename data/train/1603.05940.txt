    "in the last two decades the diffusion of particles in narrow channels has been the focus of much research @xcite .",
    "analytically , this problem has been tackled from different angles , however the most accepted description is through the fick ",
    "jacobs equation , see @xcite .    then , the fick ",
    "jacobs equation is strictly valid in the regime of very low concentration of diffusing particles in a narrow channel of varying cross section , when the interactions are negligible .",
    "when the concentration is not small the interaction plays a crucial role and the behavior of the system can be strongly modified .",
    "this has been shown for the case of the hard ",
    "core interaction , in @xcite . very recently , a generalization of the fick ",
    "jacobs equation that takes into account this interaction has been introduced . due to the hard - core interaction",
    "this new equation is nonlinear when the particles are dragged along the channel by an external force .",
    "it has been verified that this modified fick  jacobs equation successfully reproduces the concentration of particles along the channel , in the stationary state , when contrasted with simulation results @xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is to check the validity of the recently introduced nonlinear fick  jacobs equation computing the current and the mobility of particles as a function of the external force . for the sake of completeness the particle concentration profile along the channel used in the present work",
    "will be also analysed .",
    "these results are contrasted with numerical simulations of the system .",
    "the transport along channels composed by asymmetrical cavities has recently attracted a great deal of interest due to its possible application to the separation of particles of similar size ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "we use an asymmetrical cavity where the cross section is determined by the combination of two exponential functions .",
    "the purpose of using a cavity with exponential cross section is that for this cavity the original fick  jacobs equation for non - interacting particles can be exactly solved .",
    "one of the objectives is to compare the accuracy of the modified fick ",
    "jacobs equation for interacting particles with the accuracy of the original fick  jacobs equation , contrasting their results with the corresponding monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the details of the theoretical description are given in section  [ sec : teo - sinhc ] for non  interacting particles , and in section  [ sec : teo - conhc ] for interacting ones . in section  [ sec : simulations ] , we explain the method used to obtain the numerical simulations .",
    "all the results and the main analysis of the present work is presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "some final remarks are exposed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as can be seen from @xcite and @xcite the equation that describes the transport process of non - interacting brownian particles inside a tube of variable width , and bounded to an external force @xmath3 , is the so called fick ",

    "( [ eq : fj - original ] ) .",
    "in particular , we considered a chain of identical asymmetric cavities , see fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "each of these two  dimensional cavities is described by a combination of two exponential functions , @xmath11 as we are interested in asymmetrical cavities , we will use @xmath12 . in order to maintain the continuity of the piecewise function in @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 are related by : @xmath17     asymmetric cavity described by a combination of exponential functions , see eq .",

    "the parameters used are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the distances are expressed in terms of the lattice spacing @xmath22 used in the mc simulations . ]    because the particles inside the cavity are neither created nor destroyed , when the system has reached the stationary state , the current @xmath1 is constant , for a given force and mean concentration of particles in the cavity . with that in mind",
    ", it is possible to propose a complete general solution , which has two terms , one proportional to @xmath23 ( which corresponds to the homogeneous solution , @xmath24 ) , and the other proportional to @xmath25 or @xmath26",
    ". then we solve it for both regions defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity ] ) .",
    "let us consider this expression for the concentration as a function of @xmath8 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants . to determine these constants , we make use of the following conditions :    @xmath1 is constant along the cavity : :    if @xmath32 is the current when @xmath33 $ ]    and @xmath34 is the current when    @xmath35 $ ] , then    @xmath36 $ ] . @xmath9 is continuous",

    "it has been shown that it is possible to find a modified version of the fick ",
    "jacobs equation for the case of hard - core interacting particles , see @xcite .",
    "this equation is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fj - original ] ) , but it takes into account the fact that two particles can not occupy the same position at the same time .",
    "this is embraced in the non - linear term @xmath44 : @xmath45    eq .  [ eq : fj - final ] resumes the diffusion of many interacting particles , in a one  dimensional partial differential equation . if we have reached the stationary state , @xmath1 is constant , so there is no temporal dependence .",
    "it is also important to mention that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fj - original ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fj - final ] ) are only valid when the concentration is almost constant in the transverse direction of the cavity , i.e. , @xmath46 .    to solve this equation , we described the boundary of the cavity and @xmath9 with the corresponding fourier series up to the @xmath47 term",
    ". finally , we obtained the coefficients of each term and found approximate expressions of the current and the concentration inside the cavity , in the stationary state .     and @xmath48 .",
    "the dashed line was obtained from eq .",

    "the length of the horizontal axis , @xmath53 corresponds to the size of one cavity , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . ]",
    "in order to assess the validity of the results , we simulated the described system using the standard mc method .",
    "the first step is to discretize the cavity depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we used a two  dimensional square lattice of @xmath54 sites long and @xmath55 sites tall , with lattice spacing @xmath56 .",
    "then we draw the boundaries of the cavity inside the lattice . on the exits we set periodic boundary conditions to simulate an infinite channel of cavities .",
    "the process is simulated as follows .",

    "we perform averages over @xmath61 configurations . the time is @xmath52 mc time steps . ]",
    "the jumping rate of each direction is determined by the applied force .",
    "for example , if there is no force , all the particles have the same jumping rate in any direction .",
    "the jumps have a length equal to the size of a particle .",
    "if the force is applied to the right in the @xmath8axis , the jump rate is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and we set @xmath64 for simplicity .",
    "analogously , if the force is applied to the left , @xmath65 the relation between the dimensionless external force @xmath66 and the actual force @xmath3 acting on the particle is given by @xmath67 .",
    "considering @xmath68 , it is possible to assume    if a particle tries to move into an occupied site , the process will not take place .",
    "that is how we represent the hard  core interaction . in other words , it is only one particle allowed on each site of the lattice . if the particles do not interact with each other , this condition is not fulfilled ; i.e. multiple occupation is allowed . in all cases",
    "the jumps that cross the wall of the cavity are forbidden .",
    "another key question that has to be considered is the temporal discretization .",
    "we say that one time step has passed when , in average , every particle had the opportunity to jump once . that is a convention widely used in mc simulations .",
    "the mean concentration @xmath69 in the cavity is given by , @xmath70 where @xmath39 is the total number of particles inside the cavity , and in the discrete case , is the total number of sites inside the cavity .",
    "once all the rules have been set up , we let the system evolve until the stationary state has been reached .",

    "( [ eq : fj - final ] ) for the same cavity described in section  [ sec : teo - sinhc ] considering particles that interact through hard  core potential .",
    "the first quantity we can measure to check the validity of eq .  ( [ eq : fj - final ] ) is the concentration profile , @xmath9 .",
    "the results for interacting and non  interacting particles are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : nvsx ] . it can be appreciated that both theoretical solutions match the simulation points .",
    "although they are similar in some sense , it is clear that the interaction plays an important role in the way particles arrange inside the cavity .",

    "analytical results depart from numerical simulations as the force is increased , since larger forces imply a worsening of the conditions for the validity of the fick ",

    "core interaction , the mobility reduces . as expected for a non  interacting system the mobility @xmath84 and @xmath85 increases with @xmath66 ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    "this is also the behavior of @xmath84 and @xmath85 for interacting systems when the mean concentration @xmath69 is very small . for larger values of @xmath69",
    "the dimensionless force @xmath66 produces the accumulation of particles near the exit of the cavity where the transverse area @xmath10 is small .",
    "this effect increases with @xmath66 , and the mobility is reduced ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : mu - mas ] and  [ fig : mu - menos ] ) .    due to the particle  hole symmetry , for a given dimensionless force @xmath66",
    ", it is possible to obtain ( independently of the cavity shape , see @xcite ) that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the difference in the current for a given mean concentration @xmath69 .",
    "this condition is trivially fulfilled in the mc simulation ( when a particle jumps to the right , one hole jumps to the left , or vice versa ) , but it is also obtained form eq .",

    "this is in agreement with the comparatively small value of @xmath90 obtained for @xmath48 in fig .",

    "it is important to notice that , in all cases , the analytic solution for the mobility is slightly higher than the simulations , even for the exact solution of the non  interacting case .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the discretization of the system in the simulation , that is not present in the fick ",

    "core interaction between particles . in this case",
    "the solution is expressed by a finite sum of harmonic functions .",
    "we can conclude that , when the concentration is low , both systems behave in a similar manner .",
    "the interaction does not play an important role and the non  linear term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fj - final ] ) is negligible .",
    "in contrast , for higher concentrations , the non  linear term becomes significant .",
    "this implies that , when the concentration is high enough , the current of particles is mainly determined by the interaction between particles and not so much by the interaction of the particles with the borders of the cavity .",
    "for interacting particles one can see that even when there is a small difference between the results of @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained from the generalization of the fick ",
    "jacobs equation from the ones obtained from mc simulations for the same system , the general tendencies of all the analytical results as a function of concentration and external force are verified .    comparing the analytical results with the corresponding mc results",
    ", one can note that the results of the mobility @xmath2 , obtained from the modified fick  jacobs equation for interacting particles , are at least as good as the ones obtained from the original fick  jacobs equation for non - interacting particles . for the current difference",
    "@xmath90 one finds a better agreement for the case of interacting particles . on the other hand , a very good agreement between the concentration @xmath9 obtained from the modified fick ",
    "jacobs equation and numerical results was found . in summary ,",
