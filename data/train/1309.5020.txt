    "in flat spacetime and in the absence of intervening matter , electromagnetic fields do not develop tails .",
    "light propagates without dispersion and bursts of radiation which are initially sharp remain sharp as they evolve .",
    "more precisely , the electromagnetic field @xmath0 at an event @xmath1 depends on current densities and initial data only on , and not inside , the past null cone of @xmath1 .",
    "this is referred to as huygens principle .",
    "it is fundamental to our everyday lives that light and sound as we tend to experience them satisfy at least approximate versions of huygens principle .",
    "if this were not true , moving objects would appear to blur together and spoken language would be impractical .",
    "there are , however , many wave phenomena for which huygens principle does fail .",
    "a pebble falling into a pond , for example , produces water waves which persist at any fixed location long after the initial wavefront has passed . whether or not huygens principle is valid for any particular system may be interpreted as a property of the initial - value problem associated with the particular differential equations used to describe that system . from this point of view , only a handful of reasonable wave equations satisfy huygens principle exactly .",
    "the vast majority of possibilities develop tails .    in the context of general relativity , it is of particular interest to understand how the curvature of spacetime is related to the presence of tails .",
    "the vacuum maxwell equations provide a particularly well - studied example .",
    "restricting to four - dimensional background spacetimes satisfying the vacuum einstein equation @xmath2 , huygens principle holds if and only if the geometry is either flat or is associated with a plane - symmetric gravitational wave @xcite .",
    "slightly more can be said by noting that maxwell s equations are conformally invariant .",
    "electromagnetic waves therefore propagate tail - free on all ( not necessarily vacuum ) metrics which are conformal either to flat spacetime or to a plane wave .",
    "if any further possibilities exist , they are highly constrained by the results reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that plane wave spacetimes play a privileged role in the theory of electromagnetic fields .",
    "this is not , it should be emphasized , a peculiarity of maxwell s equations .",
    "the massless klein - gordon equation also satisfies huygens principle in flat and plane wave spacetimes @xcite , but essentially no others @xcite .",
    "massless spin-@xmath3 fields propagate tail - free on plane wave backgrounds as well @xcite .",
    "this paper explores whether perturbations to the plane wave spacetimes themselves satisfy a version of huygens principle . in physical terms , does a localized packet of gravitational waves passing through a background plane wave leave behind a `` wake ? ''",
    "the answer is that such a wake does exist , although its form is remarkably simple .",
    "there are many motivations of studying plane wave spacetimes .",
    "their most obvious application is as exact models of gravitational radiation in general relativity .",
    "separate from this , plane wave spacetimes also have a number of unusual mathematical properties . their relevance for ( non - gravitational ) wave tails has already been mentioned .",
    "additionally , penrose has shown @xcite that plane waves arise as universal limits of all spacetimes in the vicinity of null geodesics .",
    "this might imply that certain aspects of `` ultra - relativistic physics '' in generic curved spacetimes can be understood using effective plane wave backgrounds .",
    "ideas of this type have already been applied to understand properties of classical @xcite and quantum @xcite fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "the penrose limit and other features of plane wave spacetimes have also led to applications in string theory and related topics @xcite .",
    "regardless of motivation , we consider linear metric perturbations on vacuum plane wave backgrounds in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "the few existing results on huygens principles in linearized general relativity can not be used to immediately answer whether gravitational tails exist on plane wave backgrounds .",
    "waylen @xcite considered the linearized einstein equation on general backgrounds and in lorenz gauge .",
    "he then asked whether the trace @xmath4 of the first - order metric perturbation @xmath5 at a point @xmath1 depended on initial data lying inside the past null cone of @xmath1 .",
    "this was always found to occur unless the background spacetime is either flat or a plane wave .",
    "later , noonan @xcite and wnsch @xcite separated asked  again in lorenz gauge  whether _ any _ part of @xmath6 depended on initial data inside the past null cone of @xmath1 .",
    "they found that this always occurred unless the background was flat .",
    "none of these results settle the issue .",
    "even if a metric perturbation develops a tail in lorenz gauge , it might not do so in another gauge .",
    "this is precisely what occurs for electromagnetic fields on plane wave backgrounds . in that case",
    ", the vector potential in lorenz gauge develops a tail ( as it does in all curved spacetimes @xcite ) .",
    "such tails can , however , be removed by appropriate gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic field @xmath7}$ ] satisfies huygens principle even though @xmath8 typically does not .",
    "the problem of gauge is significantly more subtle for metric perturbations .",
    "this is both because the class of possible gauge transformations is larger than in electromagnetism and also because it is less clear which observables should be considered .",
    "the metric at a single point is not very interesting , for example .",
    "one might instead consider perturbations to curvature scalars such as @xmath9 .",
    "these scalars vanish on the background , so their first - order perturbations are gauge - invariant .",
    "it is shown here that all such perturbations satisfy huygens principles : every locally - constructed polynomial in the curvature and its derivatives propagates tail - free on plane wave backgrounds . despite this",
    ", there is a sense in which gravitational tails  unlike their scalar or electromagnetic counterparts ",
    "locally , these can only perturb one plane wave spacetime into another plane wave spacetime .",
    "even initial data with no symmetries whatsoever produces tails which retain the full five - dimensional space of killing fields associated with the background .",
    "the waveform associated with that background may be perturbed , however .",
    "this is found to depend on only a single component of the initial metric perturbation .",
    "our results are derived by first considering the general problem of first - order metric perturbations on plane wave backgrounds .",
    "we derive the retarded green function for metric perturbations in lorenz gauge and then use a kirchhoff integral to write an arbitrary metric perturbation in terms of cauchy data and any sources which may be present .",
    "the tail of the resulting green function is used to derive various properties satisfied by the `` tail portion of the metric '' in lorenz gauge .",

    "<S> one of the most important characteristics of light in flat spacetime is that it satisfies huygens principle : initial data for the vacuum maxwell equations evolves sharply along null ( and not timelike ) geodesics . in </S>",
    "<S> flat spacetime , there are no tails which linger behind expanding wavefronts . </S>",
    "<S> tails generically do exist , however , if the background spacetime is curved . </S>",
    "<S> the only non - flat vacuum geometries where electromagnetic fields satisfy huygens principle are known to be those associated with gravitational plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> this paper investigates whether perturbations to the plane wave geometry itself also propagate without tails . </S>",
    "<S> first - order perturbations to all locally - constructed curvature scalars are indeed found to satisfy huygens principles . despite this , gravitational tails do exist . </S>",
    "<S> locally , they can only perturb one plane wave spacetime into another plane wave spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> a weak localized beam of gravitational radiation passing through an arbitrarily - strong plane wave therefore leaves behind only a slight perturbation to the waveform of the background plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> the planar symmetry of that wave can not be disturbed by any linear tail . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained by first deriving the retarded green function for lorenz - gauge metric perturbations and then analyzing its consequences for generic initial - value problems . </S>"
