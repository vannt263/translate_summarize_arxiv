    "quantum correlations arising in space - like separated measurement events can be subject to strong correlations that can not be explained by classical physics @xcite . the strength of classical correlations is bounded by bell inequalities , which are known to have quantum violations , certifying the non - classicality of the physics at play . a necessary condition to violate a bell inequality is sharing an entangled quantum state @xcite . for pure states ,",
    "the standard measure of entanglement is the entanglement entropy @xcite , defined as the von neumann entropy of a subsystem of the state .",
    "the relation between entanglement and the strength of quantum correlations has long been considered an interesting question .",
    "for the simplest bell scenario , with two parties alice and bob performing one of two two - outcome measurements , the chsh inequality @xcite constitutes a tight bound on the set of classical correlations @xcite . to maximally violate the chsh inequality , one must distribute a state with maximal entanglement entropy ( the so - called maximally entangled state ) .",
    "however , when the chsh inequality was generalized to the cglmp inequality @xcite which considers scenarios with alice and bob choosing one of two @xmath1-outcome measurements , it was discovered that the maximal quantum violation of the cglmp inequality for some low values of @xmath4 can not be achieved by distributing a maximally entangled state between alice and bob @xcite .",
    "the cglmp inequality has been studied for scenarios with number of outcomes ranging up to the order of @xmath5 , and the most non - classical state is found to be far from maximally entangled @xcite .",
    "recent results @xcite suggest that the discrepancy is due to the chosen measures quantifying quantum correlations .",
    "quantum correlations are relevant in bell scenarios beyond the scope of the cglmp inequality .",
    "significant research effort has been directed at bell scenarios where alice and bob can choose between more than two measurements .",
    "such scenarios with two - outcome measurements for alice and bob have been explored in e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and many - outcome scenarios in e.g.  refs .",
    "in addition , bell scenarios with many settings and more than two parties have been studied in @xcite .    here",

    "we investigate quantum violations of this inequality for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using both maximally entangled states and general entangled states .",
    "in addition to the maximal violations of the inequality , we study the entanglement entropy of the most non - classical quantum state by both analytical and numerical means .",
    "interestingly , we find that the nature of the most non - classical state is very different depending on whether @xmath2 ( the cglmp inequality ) or @xmath6 . when @xmath2 , the entanglement entropy of the most non - classical state is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 and thus as we increase @xmath1 the state becomes less entangled .",

    "alice and bob can each perform one of @xmath0 measurements , indexed by @xmath9 respectively , with associated outcomes @xmath10 each of which can take @xmath1 different values , where @xmath11 , on some ordered space .",
    "we will focus on cases where the number of outcomes equals the local hilbert space dimension ; that is when @xmath12 .",
    "the constraint @xmath12 will from now on be assumed unless otherwise is stated .",
    "scenarios with @xmath13 will be briefly discussed .    for the given bell scenario",
    ", we can construct the following bell inequality , @xmath14    the inequality is a chained bell inequality , and we illustrate it graphically in figure [ fig : ineq ] .    to prove this assertion , we extend the method of ref .",
    "first note the following fact : @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , if we take the complement of both sides , it holds that @xmath16 ( see figure [ fig : ineq ] ) .",
    "any classical probability distribution in the given bell scenario takes the form of a convex mixture of fully deterministic probability distributions , for which all probabilities are trivial i.e.  either zero or one .",
    "therefore , since randomness is not a fundamental property but a mere statistical property in classical probability distributions , it must hold that @xmath17 , from which the inequality follows .    ' between two measurement outcomes . ]",
    "our inequality is ( up to a permutation of parties and measurement settings ) a simplified version of the inequality derived in @xcite , analogous to the simplification of the cglmp inequality in ref .",
    "an advantage of our inequality is that its form is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "another advantage is that the inequality only depends on the relative ordering of the outcomes , and not their ascribed values .    for sake of completeness",
    ", we show that of the specific case when the outcomes take the values @xmath18 , our inequality is equivalent to that of ref .",

    "let us denote the outcomes of alice s and bob s measurements by @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , particular measurements were introduced with the motivation that the maximally entangled state has the property that if alice measures an observable with an eigenstate @xmath27 , and bob measures an observable with conjugated eigenvectors @xmath28 , correlations will be perfect .",
    "therefore , we let alice and bob measure in the respective bases given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath9 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we have conducted extensive numerical studies using semidefinite programs ( sdps ) @xcite to investigate whether these measurements are optimal .",
    "however , the problem of optimizing the quantity @xmath24 over the measurement of alice , the measurements of bob , and the shared state , can not be directly maped into an sdp . instead we have used a see - saw technique in which we first use an sdp to optimize only over the measurements of alice .",
    "then we run another sdp to optimize over the measurements of bob while fixing alice s measurements as obtained in the previous sdp .",
    "finally , we fix alice s and bob s measurements as returned by the two previous sdps and run a third sdp optimizing over only over the shared state .",
    "this procedure is iterated until a stable value of @xmath24 is obtained .",
    "naturally , this procedure does not guarantee that @xmath24 achieves its global optimum under quantum theory .",
    "yet , for all investigated cases ranging over several low values of @xmath32 , the obtained value of @xmath24 by the see - saw method returns the above measurements of alice and bob . due to this numerical evidence",
    ", we will conjecture the above measurements as optimal .",
    "the numerics supporting the conjecture of the optimal measurements is performed with the constraint that @xmath12 .",

    "specifically , we have considered @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we have observed no instance in which @xmath13 yields an enhancement over the case @xmath12 .    following the conjecture of the optimal measurements",
    ", we can define the bell operator , @xmath36 , associated with the bell expression @xmath24 as @xmath37 thus , we can write that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is some shared quantum state . the optimal value of @xmath24 is found from computing the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath36 , and the corresponding eigenvector is the associated quantum state that gives rise to the maximal violation i.e.  it is the most non - classical quantum state .",
    "however , in the case of pure quantum states we can extensively simplify the eigenvalue computation by using the schmidt decomposition to write any pure quantum state in the form @xmath40 for @xmath41 being real numbers respecting the normalization @xmath42 .",
    "it is then possible to write the bell expression @xmath24 in the following form @xmath43 where the @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 this expression is derived in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "the problem of finding the maximal quantum violation of the inequalities reduces to finding the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath45 .",

    ", we find that the limit is @xmath57 which goes to zero as @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the right - hand - side of is the no - signaling bound of @xmath24 .",
    "this is realized from the fact that the no - signaling bound of @xmath59 in coincides with its algebraic bound , that is zero , and that the affine transformation relating @xmath24 and @xmath59 is @xmath60 up to permutations of parties and settings .",
    "thus , in the limit of many measurement settings , the above result of quantum theory does converge to the no - signaling bound .",
    "however , the algebraic bound of @xmath24 is zero , and thus there is a discrepancy between the no - signaling bound and the algebraic bound of @xmath24 .    in the other limiting case of many outcomes , finding",
    "the value of @xmath61 is a bit more involved .",
    "we can use the fact that the sum in equation can be evaluated as an integral , which can be related to the trigamma function , @xmath62 , defined as the second logarithmic derivative of the gamma function , @xmath63 , as follows @xmath64 in appendix [ appb ] , we prove this relation .",
    "it is worth noting that for the special case of @xmath2 , it was shown in @xcite that the limit evaluates to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is catalan s constant , corresponding to what was obtained for the cglmp inequality in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "evidently , unless we let both @xmath67 , we can not reach the algebraic bound of @xmath24 by using maximally entangled states .",
    "this puts our inequality in contrast to that of ref.@xcite in which the algebraic bound coincides with the no - signaling bound and thus can be asymptotically achieved in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "we will now investigate the optimal quantum violations of the inequalities by sharing general entangled states .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the optimal quantum violation of the inequality corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath45 and the entangled state giving rise to the violation is the associated eigenvector of @xmath45 .",
    "this reasoning relies on the measurements and indeed being optimal choices . to strengthen this conjecture ,",
    "we have verified the optimality of these results numerically using sdps @xcite for the cases @xmath69 .",
    "and dimensions up to about @xmath70 .",
    "solid lines are obtained from maximally entangled states , the dotted lines from the most non - classical quantum state , and the dashed lines from the approximation state @xmath71 in . ]    in figure [ fig:1 ] , we have computed the maximal violation of the inequalities , the violation using a maximally entangled state , and also the violation due to the approximate state @xmath71 which is discussed below .",
    "we have chosen some particular values of @xmath72 and @xmath1 ranging from @xmath73 up to approximately about @xmath70 in exponentially increasing increments .",
    "the computation of the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath45 ( the maximal violation ) can be efficiently implemented using power iteration over the krylov space associated to @xmath45 .",
    "we elaborate on the numerical technique in appendix [ appc ] .",
    "the results suggest that the optimal violation of the inequality approaches the algebraic bound of @xmath24 , namely zero , as @xmath74 for all investigated values of @xmath0 .",
    "the convergence to the algebraic bound is more rapid with increasing @xmath0 .      due to the apparent discrepancy between",
    "maximally entangled state and the most non - classical state , @xmath75 , in terms of their ability to minimize @xmath24 , it is interesting to investigate the properties of @xmath75 .    for simplicity ,",

    "@xcite . on the one hand",

    "for general @xmath0 , the numerics in figure [ fig:1 ] indicate that the violation due to the approximate state @xmath71 converges to the algebraic bound of @xmath24 in the limit of many outcomes .",
    "furthermore , it appears that with higher @xmath0 , the violation due to @xmath71 increasingly well approximates the optimal quantum violation of the inequality .",
    "the question of how well the state @xmath71 approximates the entanglement entropy of the most non - classical state @xmath75 is investigated in the next section .",
    "in order to investigate the relation between maximal non - classicality and entanglement , we will study the entanglement entropy of the state @xmath75 by extensive numerics for high @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will also study to what extent the degree of entanglement of @xmath75 can be approximated with the introduced state @xmath85 .",
    "( dashed line ) for @xmath72 and dimensions up to @xmath70 . ]    using the schmidt basis representation , the entanglement entropy of a state @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 which is easily realized to be a number between zero and one ( see note .",
    "division by @xmath88 means measuring entropy in units of bits . for @xmath1-level system ,",
    "division by @xmath89 corresponds to measuring entropy in units of `` dits '' .",

    "the entanglement entropy is maximized for the maximally entangled state for which @xmath90 . in figure",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot the entanglement entropy of the state @xmath75 and the approximate state @xmath71 for a few values of @xmath0 and for dimensions up to about @xmath70 .",
    "remarkably , our results show that for the investigated values of @xmath0 exceeding @xmath2 , the entanglement entropy of the most non - classical state is not monotonic with @xmath1 .",
    "the sharpness of the trough of the entanglement entropy increases with the value of @xmath0 .",
    "our numerics suggests that @xmath91 is a non - monotonic function whenever @xmath92 .",
    "in addition , while for small values of @xmath1 the state @xmath82 provides a less good approximation of the entanglement entropy of the most non - classical state @xcite , we see that for @xmath93 , @xmath94 becomes a significantly better approximation of the entanglement entropy of @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of the approximate state with respect to @xmath75 appears to increase with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    due to the very slow convergence of the entanglement entropy of @xmath75 , especially for fix @xmath0 and variable @xmath1 , it is hard to tell how it behaves for @xmath1 beyond the range we have studied .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that as @xmath74 , the entanglement entropy converges to that of the state @xmath71 . in appendix",
    "[ appd ] , we show the following limit @xmath95 evidently , the entanglement entropy behaves very differently depending on whether we consider case of the cglmp inequality ( @xmath2 ) or allow for more measurements .",
    "also , this result implies that the entanglement entropy ( at the very least for the state @xmath71 ) is a non - monotonic function of @xmath1 whenever @xmath6 , which falls in line with our numerical results in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the above results show that @xmath96 entanglement entropy of the optimal and approximate state is non - monotonic for @xmath6 and that @xmath97 it converged to that of the maximally entangled state for @xmath6 .",
    "note however , that this does not imply that the optimal state or approximate state are the maximal entangled state for @xmath6 and @xmath58 .",
    "it simply means that the difference between their corresponding entanglement entropies becomes infinitesimal .",
    "an intuitive picture can be obtained by plotting the corresponding schmidt coefficients @xmath98 as a function of @xmath99 , as was done in @xcite .",
    "one observes that the shape of the curve is @xmath100-shaped and that for increasing @xmath1 , as well as @xmath0 the middle part becomes flatter and flatter .",
    "the above result suggests that as @xmath101 the function @xmath102 remains @xmath100-shaped over @xmath103 $ ] for @xmath2 , while for @xmath6 it becomes essentially a constant function for @xmath104 , as in the case of the maximally entangled state , apart from a peak with infinitesimal support at @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , those two peaks with infinitesimal support make the maximal violations of the bell inequality for this state differ from that of the maximally entangled state .",
    "note that entanglement entropy as defined in is the commonly used measure for entanglement of a state .",
    "however , we can also look at the relative entropy or kullback - leibler divergence between the maximally entangled state and the optimal or approximate state , i.e.  @xmath107 where @xmath86 is either the optimal or the approximate state .    , between the maximally entangled state @xmath47 and @xmath86 , which for solid lines represents the optimal state @xmath75 and for dashed lines represents the approximate state @xmath108 . ]",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig.relent ] as a function of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in appendix [ appd ] that @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "note that the divergence for @xmath2 is very slow , @xmath111 .",
    "this expression agrees with the numerical results shown in figure [ fig.relent ] .",
    "furthermore , it is in accordance with the above picture , where we can attribute the divergence of the relative entropy for @xmath2 to a finite difference of the @xmath98 and @xmath112 for infinitely many @xmath99 , corresponding to a finite interval of @xmath103 $ ] , while the finite value of the relative entropy for @xmath6 reflects the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath112 differ only for finitely many @xmath99 , corresponding to the two peaks at @xmath105 and @xmath106 which have infinitesimal support .    to complete the discussion , we plot @xmath113 as a function of @xmath0 in figure [ fig.infkl ] .",
    "one sees that the relative entropy between the maximally entangled state and the approximate states for infinite @xmath1 goes to zero as @xmath114 , which is in accordance with the results of @xcite , meaning that the peaks of @xmath115 at @xmath105 and @xmath106 become smaller as @xmath0 increases until for @xmath114 the approximate state becomes identical to the maximally entangled state .",
    "in this work , we have introduced a much simplified version of the mutli - setting generalization of the cglmp inequality first presented in ref .",
    "we have conjectured the optimal measurements and provided numerics supporting this claim for some low values of @xmath80 .",
    "then , we studied quantum violations of our inequalities using both maximally entangled and generally entangled states and demonstrated that the maximal violations are obtained by non - maximally entangled states .",
    "we gave strong numerical evidence that the tsirelson bound of the bell expression @xmath24 coincides with the algebraic bound of that quantity , namely zero .",
    "however , our main result is the strong evidence for the non - monotonicity of the entanglement entropy of the most non - classical state , as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath6 .     and the approximate state @xmath85 as a function of the number of the number of settings @xmath0 in the limit @xmath74 . ]",
    "we see that the most non - classical state for any @xmath6 become more and more entangled with increasing @xmath1 and its entanglement entropy converges to that of the maximally entangled state .",
    "this is very much opposite to the quantum behavior observed for the cglmp inequality @xcite i.e.  when @xmath2 .",
    "our results suggest that the discrepancy between entanglement and the strength of quantum correlations is strongly dependent on the number of settings of the bell scenario and is eradicated in the limit of large @xmath1 , given more than two settings .",
