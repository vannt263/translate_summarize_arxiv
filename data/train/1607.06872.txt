    "the study of surfaces which minimize the perimeter is a classical topic in analysis and geometry and probably one of the oldest problems in the mathematical literature : according to the first book of virgil s aeneid , dido , the legendary queen of carthage , needed to study these questions in order to found her reign in 814 b.c .",
    "( in spite of the great mathematical talent of dido and of her vivid geometric intuition , aeneas broke his betrothal with her after a short time to seal the mediterranean towards the coasts of italy , but this is another story ) .",
    "the first problem in the study of these surfaces of minimal perimeter ( minimal surfaces , for short ) lies in proving that minimizers do exist .",
    "indeed `` nice '' sets , for which one can compute the perimeter using an intuitive notion known from elementary school , turn out to be a `` non compact '' family ( roughly speaking , for instance , an `` ugly '' set can be approximated by a sequence of `` nice '' sets , thus the limit point of the sequence may end up outside the family ) . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "a classical tool of the calculus of variation is to look for minimizers in a wider family of candidates : this larger family will then possess the desired compactness properties to ensure the existence of a minimum , and then the regularity of the minimal candidate can be ( hopefully ) proved a posteriori .    to this end , one needs to set up an appropriate notion of perimeter for the sets in the enlarged family of candidates , since no intuitive notion of perimeter is available , in principle , in this generality . the classical approach of caccioppoli ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to this question lies in the observation that if  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are to an open set , possibly with smooth boundary , which can be seen as the `` ambient space '' for our problem .",
    "] smooth sets and  @xmath2 is the external normal of  @xmath1 , then , for any vector field  @xmath3 with  @xmath4 for any  @xmath5 , we have that @xmath6 consequently , the perimeter of  @xmath1 in @xmath0 , i.e. the measure of the boundary of  @xmath1 inside  @xmath0 ( that is , the @xmath7-dimensional hausdorff measure of  @xmath8 in  @xmath0 ) , satisfies the inequality @xmath9 for every vector field  @xmath3 with  @xmath10 , where the divergence theorem has been used in the last identity .",
    "viceversa , if  @xmath1 is a smooth set , its normal vector can be extended near  @xmath8 , and then to the whole of  @xmath11 , to a vector field  @xmath12 , with  @xmath13 for any  @xmath14 .",
    "then , if  @xmath15)$ ] , with  @xmath16 in an  @xmath17-neighborhood of  @xmath0 , one can take  @xmath18 and find that  @xmath3 , @xmath4 for any  @xmath14 and @xmath19 by taking  @xmath17 as small as we wish and recalling  , we obtain that @xmath20 while   was obtained for smooth sets  @xmath1 , the classical approach for minimal surfaces is in fact to take   as _ definition _ of perimeter of a ( not necessarily smooth ) set  @xmath1 in  @xmath0 .",
    "the class of sets obtained in this way indeed has the necessary compactness properties ( and the associated functional has the desired lower semicontinuity properties ) to give the existence of minimizers : that is , one finds ( at least ) one set  @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 for any  @xmath23 such that  @xmath24 coincides with  @xmath1 in a neighborhood of  @xmath25 .",
    "the boundary of this minimal set  @xmath1 satisfies , a posteriori , a bunch of additional regularity properties  just to recall the principal ones : @xmath26 we refer to  @xcite for complete statements and proofs ( in particular , the claim in   here corresponds to theorem  10.11 in  @xcite , the claim in   here to theorem  11.8 there , and the claim in   here to theorem  16.4 there ) .",
    "a natural problem that is closely related to these regularity results is the complete description of classical minimal surfaces in the whole of the space which are also graphs in some direction ( the so - called minimal graphs ) .",
    "these questions , that go under the name of bernstein s problem , have , in the classical case , the following positive answer : @xmath27 we refer to theorems  17.8 and  17.10 in  @xcite for further details on the claims in   and  , respectively .",
    "it is also worth recalling that @xmath28 see e.g. chapter  10 in  @xcite .",
    "recently , and especially in light of the seminal paper  @xcite , some attention has been devoted to a variation of the classical notion of perimeters which takes into account also long - range interactions between sets , as well as the corresponding minimization problem .",
    "this type of _ nonlocal minimal surfaces _ arises naturally , for instance , in the study of fractals  @xcite , cellular automata  @xcite and phase transitions  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a detailed introduction to the topic ) .",
    "a simple idea for defining a notion of nonlocal perimeter may be described as follows .",
    "first of all , such nonlocal perimeter should compute the interaction  @xmath29 of all the points of  @xmath1 against all the points of the complement of  @xmath1 , which we denote by  @xmath30 .",
    "on the other hand , if we want to localize these contributions inside the domain  @xmath0 , it is convenient to split  @xmath1 into  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 , as well as the set  @xmath30 into  @xmath33 and  @xmath34 , and so consider the four possibilities of interaction between  @xmath1 and  @xmath30 given by @xmath35 among these interactions , we observe that the latter one only depends on the configuration of the set outside  @xmath0 , and so @xmath36 for any  @xmath23 such that  @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in a minimization process with fixed data outside  @xmath0 , the term  @xmath38 does not change the minimizers .",
    "it is therefore natural to omit this term in the energy functional ( and , as a matter of fact , omitting this term may turn out to be important from the mathematical point of view , since this term may provide an infinite contribution to the energy ) : for this reason , the nonlocal perimeter considered in  @xcite is given by the sum of the first three terms in  , namely one defines @xmath39 as for the interaction  @xmath40 , of course some freedom is possible , and basically any interaction for which  @xmath41 is finite , say , for smooth sets  @xmath1 makes perfect sense .",
    "a natural choice performed in  @xcite is to take the interaction as a weighted lebesgue measure , where the weight is translation invariant , isotropic and homogeneous : more precisely , for any disjoint sets  @xmath42 and  @xmath43 , one defines @xmath44 with  @xmath45 . with this choice of the fractional parameter  @xmath46",
    ", one sees that @xmath47_{w^{\\sigma , p}({\\mathbb{r}}^n ) } : =   \\iint_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n\\times { \\mathbb{r}}^n } \\frac{|\\chi_e(x)-\\chi_e(y)|^p } { |x - y|^{n+p\\sigma } } \\,dx\\,dy \\\\ & & \\qquad= 2\\iint_{e\\times e^c } \\frac{dx\\,dy } { |x - y|^{n+p\\sigma } } = 2i(e , e^c)= 2\\,{\\rm per}_s\\,(e,{\\mathbb{r}}^n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as long as  @xmath48 , that is the fractional perimeter of a set coincides ( up to normalization constants ) to a fractional sobolev norm of the corresponding characteristic function ( see e.g.  @xcite for a simple introduction to fractional sobolev spaces ) .",
    "moreover , for any fixed  @xmath49 , @xmath50 also , for any fixed  @xmath14 , @xmath51 accordingly , by the divergence theorem @xmath52 \\\\ = \\ ; & -\\frac{1}{2s}\\int_{e^c } \\,dy \\left [ \\int_{\\partial e } \\frac{\\nu(x)\\cdot(x - y)}{|x - y|^{n+2s } } \\,d{\\mathcal{h}^{n-1}}(x ) \\right ] \\\\ = \\ ; & -\\frac{1}{2s\\,(n+2s-2 ) } \\int_{\\partial e } \\,d{\\mathcal{h}^{n-1}}(x)\\,\\left [ \\int_{e^c } { \\rm div}_y\\ , \\frac{\\nu(x)}{|x - y|^{n+2s-2}}\\,dy\\right ] \\\\ = \\ ; & \\frac{1}{2s\\,(n+2s-2 ) } \\iint_{(\\partial e)\\times(\\partial e ) } \\frac{\\nu(x)\\cdot\\nu(y)}{|x - y|^{n+2s-2 } } \\,d{\\mathcal{h}^{n-1}}(x)\\,d{\\mathcal{h}^{n-1}}(y ) . \\end{split}\\ ] ] that is , @xmath53 which suggests that the fractional perimeter is a weighted measure of the variation of the normal vector around the boundary of a set . as a matter of fact",
    ", as @xmath54 , the @xmath46-perimeter recovers the classical perimeter from many point of views ( a sketchy discussion about this will be given in appendix [ app12 ] ) .",
    "also , in appendix [ 9ojknaasaw ] , we briefly discuss the second variation of the @xmath46-perimeter on surfaces of vanishing nonlocal mean curvature and we show that graphs with vanishing nonlocal mean curvature can not have horizontal normals .",
    "let us now recall ( among the others ) an elementary , but useful , application of this notion of fractional perimeter in the framework of digital image reconstruction .",
    "suppose that we have a black and white digitalized image , say a bitmap , in which each pixel is either colored in black or in white .",
    "we call  @xmath1 the `` black set '' and we are interested in measuring its perimeter ( the reason for that may be , for instance , that noises or impurities could be distinguished by having `` more perimeter '' than the `` real '' picture , since they may present irregular or fractal boundaries ) . in doing that , we need to be able to compute such perimeter with a very good precision .",
    "of course , numerical errors could affect the computation , since the digital process replaced the real picture by a pixel representation of it , but we would like that our computation becomes more and more reliable if the resolution of the image is sufficiently high , i.e. if the size of the pixels is sufficiently small .",
    "unfortunately , we see that , in general , an accurate computation of the perimeter is not possible , not even for simple sets , since the numerical error produced by the pixel may not become negligible , even when the pixels are small . to observe this phenomenon ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    "we can consider a grid of square pixels of small side  @xmath17 and a black square  @xmath1 of side  @xmath55 , with the black square rotated by  @xmath56 degrees with respect to the orientation of the pixels .",
    "now , the digitalization of the square will produce a numerical error , since , say , the pixels that intersect the square are taken as black , and so each side of the square is replaced by a `` sawtooth '' curve ( see figure  [ dente di sega ] ) .        notice that the length of each of these sawtooth curves is  @xmath57 ( independently on how small each teeth is , that is independently on the size of  @xmath17 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the perimeter of the digitalized image is  @xmath58 , instead of  @xmath59 , which was the original perimeter of the square .",
    "this shows the rather unpleasant fact that the perimeter may be poorly approximated numerically , even in case of high precision digitalization processes .",
    "it is a rather remarkable fact that fractional perimeters do not present the same inconvenience and indeed the numerical error in computing the fractional perimeter becomes small when the pixels are small enough .",
    "indeed , the number of pixels which intersect the sides of the original square is  @xmath60 ( recall that the side of the square is  @xmath55 and the side of each pixel is of size  @xmath17 ) .",
    "also , the @xmath46-perimeter of each pixel is  @xmath61 ( since this is the natural scale factor of the interaction in  , with  @xmath62 ) .",
    "then , the numerical error in the fractional perimeter comes from the contributions of all these pixels . ] and it is therefore  @xmath63 , which tends to zero for small  @xmath17 , thus showing that the nonlocal perimeters are more efficient than classical ones in this type of digitalization process .",
    "thus , given its mathematical interest and its importance in concrete applications , it is desirable to reach a better understanding of the surfaces which minimize the @xmath46-perimeter ( that one can call @xmath46-minimal surfaces ) . to start with ,",
    "let us remark that an analogue of   holds true , in the sense that @xmath46-minimal surfaces have vanishing @xmath46-mean curvature in a sense that we now briefly describe .",
    "given a set  @xmath1 with smooth boundary and  @xmath64 , we define @xmath65 the expression in   is intended in the principal value sense , namely the singularity is taken in an averaged limit , such as @xmath66 for simplicity , we omit the principal value from the notation .",
    "it is also useful to recall   and to remark that  @xmath67 can be computed as a weighted boundary integral of the normal , namely @xmath68 this quantity  @xmath67 is what we call the nonlocal mean curvature of  @xmath1 at the point  @xmath69 , and the name is justified by the following observation :    [ iu678hhjka ] if  @xmath1 is a set with smooth boundary that minimizes the @xmath46-perimeter in  @xmath0 , then  @xmath70 for any  @xmath71 .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ iu678hhjka ] will be given in section  [ iu678hhjka : pf ] .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a version of lemma  [ iu678hhjka ] that holds true ( in the viscosity sense ) without assuming that the set has smooth boundary .",
    "see also  @xcite for further comments on this notion of nonlocal mean curvature .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the fractional analogue of the regularity results in   and  . at the moment , a complete regularity theory in the fractional case is still not available .",
    "at best , one can obtain regularity results either in low dimension or when  @xmath46 is sufficiently close to  @xmath72 ( see  @xcite and also  @xcite for higher regularity results ) : namely , the analogue of   is :    [ reg : a ] let  @xmath73 be a minimizer for the @xmath46-perimeter in  @xmath0 .",
    "assume that    * either  @xmath62 , * or  @xmath74 and  @xmath75 , for some  @xmath76 sufficiently small .",
    "then , @xmath77 is smooth .",
    "similarly , a fractional analogue of   is known , by now , only when  @xmath46 is sufficiently close to  @xmath72 :    [ reg : b ] let  @xmath73 be a minimizer for the @xmath46-perimeter in  @xmath0 .",
    "assume that  @xmath78 and  @xmath79 , for some  @xmath80 sufficiently small .",
    "then , @xmath81 is smooth , being  @xmath82 a closed set of hausdorff dimension at most  @xmath83 .    differently from the statement in  ,",
    "it is not known if theorems  [ reg : a ] and  [ reg : b ] are sharp , and in fact there are no known examples of @xmath46-minimal surfaces with singular sets : and , as a matter of fact , in dimension @xmath84 , these pathological examples  if they exist  can not be built by symmetric cones ( which means that they either do not exist or are pretty hard to find ! ) , see  @xcite .    in  @xcite ,",
    "several quantitative regularity estimates for local minimizers are given ( as a matter of fact , these estimates are valid in a much more general setting , but , for simplicity , we focus here on the most basic statements and proofs ) .",
    "for instance , minimizers of the @xmath46-perimeter have locally finite perimeter ( that is , classical perimeter , not only fractional perimeter ) , as stated in the next result :    [ b v t ] let  @xmath73 be a minimizer for the @xmath46-perimeter in  @xmath85 .",
    "then @xmath86 for a suitable constant  @xmath87 .",
    "we stress that theorem  [ b v t ] presents several novelties with respect to the existing literature .",
    "first of all , it provides a scaling invariant regularity estimate that goes beyond the natural scaling of the @xmath46-perimeter , that is valid in any dimension and without any topological restriction on the @xmath46-minimal surface ( analogous results for the classical perimeter are not known in this generality ) .",
    "also , in spite of the fact that , for the sake of simplicity , we state and prove theorem  [ b v t ] only in the case of minimizers of the @xmath46-perimeter , more general versions of this result hold true for stable solutions and for more general interaction kernels ( even for kernels without any regularizing effect ) and this type of results also leads to new compactness and existence theorems , see  @xcite for full details on this topic .    as a matter of fact",
    ", we stress that the analogue of theorem  [ b v t ] for stable surfaces which are critical points of the classical perimeter is only known , up to now , for two - dimensional surfaces that are simply connected and immersed in  @xmath88 ( hence , this is a case in which the nonlocal theory can go beyond the local one ) .",
    "now , we briefly discuss the fractional analogue of the bernstein s problem .",
    "let us start by pointing out that , by combining   and  , we have an `` abstract '' version of the bernstein s problem , which states that _ if  @xmath1 is a minimal graph in  @xmath89 and the minimal surfaces in  @xmath11 are smooth , then  @xmath1 is a halfspace_.    of course , for the way we have written   and  , this abstract statement seems only to say that  @xmath90 : nevertheless this abstract version of the bernstein s problem is very useful in the classical case , since it admits a nice fractional counterpart , which is :    [ gh : a ] if  @xmath1 is an @xmath46-minimal graph in  @xmath89 and the @xmath46-minimal surfaces in  @xmath11 are smooth , then  @xmath1 is a halfspace .    this result was proved in  @xcite . by combining it with theorem  [ reg : a ] ( using the notation  @xmath91 ) , we obtain :    [ bers : a ] let  @xmath92 be an @xmath46-minimal graph .",
    "assume that    * either  @xmath93 , * or  @xmath94 and  @xmath75 , for some  @xmath76 sufficiently small .",
    "then ,  @xmath1 is a halfspace .",
    "this is , at the moment , the fractional counterpart of   ( we stress , however , that any improvement in the fractional regularity theory would give for free an improvement in the fractional bernstein s problem , via theorem  [ gh : a ] ) .",
    "we remark again that , differently from the claim in  , it is not known if the statement in theorem  [ bers : a ] is sharp , since there are no known examples of @xmath46-minimal graphs other than the hyperplanes .",
    "it is worth recalling that , by a blow - down procedure , one can deduce from theorem  [ reg : a ] that global @xmath46-minimal surfaces are hyperplanes , as stated in the following result :    [ reg : fla ] let  @xmath73 be a minimizer for the @xmath46-perimeter in any domain of  @xmath11 .",
    "assume that    * either  @xmath62 , * or  @xmath74 and  @xmath75 , for some  @xmath76 sufficiently small .",
    "then , @xmath1 is a halfspace .    of course",
    ", a very interesting spin - off of the regularity theory in theorem  [ reg : fla ] lies in finding quantitative flatness estimates : namely , if we know that a set  @xmath1 is an  @xmath46-minimizer in a large domain , can we say that it is sufficiently close to be a halfspace , and if so , how close , and in which sense ?    this question has been recently addressed in  @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the results in  @xcite are richer than the ones we present here , and they are valid for a very general class of interaction kernels and of perimeters of nonlocal type ",
    "nevertheless we think it is interesting to give a flavor of them even in their simpler form , to underline their connection with the regularity theory that we discussed till now .    in this setting",
    ", we present here the following result when @xmath62 ( see indeed  @xcite for more general statements ) :    [ 1123thj ] let  @xmath95 .",
    "let  @xmath96 be a minimizer for the @xmath46-perimeter in  @xmath85 .",
    "then there exists a halfplane  @xmath97 such that @xmath98 where  @xmath99 is here the symmetric difference of the two sets ( i.e. @xmath100 ) and  @xmath87 is a constant .",
    "we stress that theorem  [ 1123thj ] may be seen as a quantitative version of theorem  [ reg : fla ] when  @xmath62 : indeed if  @xmath73 is a minimizer for the @xmath46-perimeter in any domain of  @xmath11 we can send  @xmath101 in   and obtain that  @xmath1 is a halfplane .",
    "we observe that , till now , we have presented and discussed a series of results which are somehow in accordance , as much as possible , with the classical case .",
    "now we present something with striking difference from the classical case .",
    "the minimizers of the classical perimeter in a convex domain reach continuously the boundary data ( see e.g. theorem  15.9 in  @xcite ) .",
    "quite surprisingly , the minimizers of the fractional perimeter have the tendency to stick at the boundary .",
    "this phenomenon has been discovered in  @xcite , where several explicit stickiness examples have been given .",
    "roughly speaking , the stickiness phenomenon may be described as follows .",
    "we know from lemma  [ iu678hhjka ] that nonlocal minimal surfaces in a domain  @xmath0 need to adjust their shape in order to make the nonlocal minimal curvature vanish inside  @xmath0 .",
    "this is a rather strong condition , since the nonlocal minimal curvature `` sees '' the set all over the space . as a consequence , in many cases in which the boundary data are `` not favorable '' for this condition to hold",
    ", the nonlocal minimal surfaces may prefer to modify their shape by sticking at the boundary , where the condition is not prescribed , in order to compensate the values of the nonlocal mean curvature inside  @xmath0 .    in many cases , for instance",
    ", the nonlocal minimal set may even prefer to `` disappear '' , i.e. its contribution inside  @xmath0 becomes empty and its boundary sticks completely to the boundary of  @xmath0 . in concrete cases , the fact that the nonlocal minimal set disappears may be induced by a suitable choice of the data outside  @xmath0 or by an appropriate choice of the fractional parameter . as a prototype example of these two phenomena ,",
    "we recall here the following results given in  @xcite :    [ st:001 ] for any  @xmath102 , let @xmath103 let  @xmath104 be the @xmath46-minimal set among all the sets  @xmath1 such that  @xmath105",
    ".    then , there exists  @xmath106 , depending on @xmath46 and @xmath107 , such that for any  @xmath108 $ ] we have that @xmath109    [ st:002 ] as  @xmath110 , the @xmath46-minimal set in  @xmath111 that agrees with a sector outside  @xmath112 sticks to the sector .",
    "more precisely : let  @xmath113 be the @xmath46-minimizer among all the sets  @xmath1 such that @xmath114 then , there exists  @xmath115 such that for any  @xmath116 $ ] we have that  @xmath117 .",
    "we stress the sharp difference between the local and the nonlocal cases exposed in theorems  [ st:001 ] and  [ st:002 ] : indeed , in the local framework , in both cases the minimal surface is a segment inside the ball  @xmath112 , while in the nonlocal case it coincides with a piece of the circumference  @xmath118 .",
    "the stickiness phenomenon of nonlocal minimal surfaces may also be caused by a sufficiently high oscillation of the data outside  @xmath0 .",
    "this concept is exposed in the following result :    [ m : sr ] let  @xmath119 and let  @xmath120 be @xmath46-minimal in  @xmath121 with datum outside  @xmath121 given by  @xmath122 , where @xmath123\\times ( -\\infty ,-",

    "moreover , the stickiness region gets close to the origin , up to a power of  @xmath124 .",
    "more precisely : there exist  @xmath126 and  @xmath127 , depending on  @xmath46 , such that if  @xmath128 then @xmath129\\subseteq e_m^c   \\\\{\\mbox{and } } & \\quad(-1,1]\\times [ -m,\\,-c_o m^{\\frac{1 + 2s}{2 + 2s}}]\\subseteq e_m . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    it is worth to remark that the stickiness phenomenon in theorem  [ m : sr ] becomes `` more and more visible '' as the oscillation of the data increase , since , referring to  , we have that @xmath130 hence the sticked portion of  @xmath125 on  @xmath131 becomes , proportionally to  @xmath124 , larger and larger when  @xmath132 .    also , the exponent  @xmath133 in   is optimal , see again  @xcite .",
    "the stickiness phenomenon detected in theorem  [ m : sr ] is described in figure  [ m : sr : f ] .",
    "we believe that the stickiness phenomenon is indeed rather common among nonlocal minimal surfaces , and indeed it may occur even under small modifications of boundary data for which the nonlocal minimal surfaces cut the boundary in a transversal way .",
    "a typical , and rather striking , example of this situation happens for perturbation of halfplanes in  @xmath134 .",
    "that is , an arbitrarily small perturbation of the data corresponding to halfplanes is sufficient for the stickiness phenomenon to occur . of course",
    ", the smaller the perturbation , the smaller the stickiness : nevertheless , small perturbations are enough to cause the fact that the boundary data of nonlocal minimal surfaces are not attained in a continuous way , and indeed they may exhibit jumps ( notice that this lack of boundary regularity for @xmath46-minimal surfaces is rather surprising , especially after the interior regularity results discussed in theorem  [ reg : a ] and  [ reg : b ] and it shows that the boundary behavior of the halfplanes is rather unstable ) .",
    "a detailed result goes as follows :    [ per ] there exists  @xmath135 such that for any  @xmath136 $ ] the following statement holds true .",
    "let  @xmath137 .",
    "let also @xmath138\\times[0,\\delta],\\qquad f_+ : = [ 2,3]\\times[0,\\delta],\\qquad h:={\\mathbb{r}}\\times(-\\infty,0).\\ ] ] assume that  @xmath139 , with @xmath140    let  @xmath1 be an @xmath46-minimal set in  @xmath0 among all the sets which coincide with  @xmath24 outside  @xmath0 .",

    "the result of theorem  [ per ] is depicted in figure  [ fper ] .",
    "let us briefly give some further comments on the stickiness phenomena discussed above .",
    "first of all , we would like to convince the reader ( as well as ourselves ) that this type of behaviors indeed occurs in the nonlocal case .",
    "to this end , let us make an investigation to find how the @xmath46-minimal set  @xmath143 in  @xmath144 with datum @xmath145 looks like .",
    "when  @xmath146 , then  @xmath147 is the halfplane , so the interesting case is when  @xmath148 ; say , up to symmetries ,  @xmath149 .",
    "now , we know how an investigation works : we need to place all the usual suspects in a row and try to find the culprit .",
    "the line of suspect is on figure  [ sospetti ] ( remember that we have to find the @xmath46-minimal set among them ) .",
    "some of the suspects resemble our prejudices on how the culprit should look like .",
    "for instance , for what we saw on tv , we have the prejudice that serial killers always wear black gloves and raincoats .",
    "similarly , for what we learnt from the hyperplanes , we may have the prejudice that @xmath46-minimal surfaces meet the boundary data in a smooth fashion ( this prejudice will turn out to be wrong , as we will see ) . in this sense ,",
    "the usual suspects number  1 and  2 in figure  [ sospetti ] are the ones who look like the serial killers .",
    "* # 1 *    then , we have the regular guys with some strange hobbies , we know from tv that they are also quite plausible candidates for being guilty ; in our analogy , these are the usual suspects number  3 and  4 , which meet the boundary data in a lipschitz or hlder fashion ( and one may also observe that number  3 is the minimal set in the local case ) .    then , we have the candidates which look above suspicion , the ones to which nobody ever consider to be guilty , usually the postman or the butler . in our analogy , these are the suspects number  5 and  6 , which are discontinuous at the boundary .",
    "now , we know from tv how we should proceed : if a suspect has a strong and verified alibi , we can rule him or her out of the list . in our case , an alibi can be offered by the necessary condition for @xmath46-minimality given in lemma  [ iu678hhjka ] .",
    "indeed , if one of our suspects  @xmath1 does not satisfy that  @xmath150 along  @xmath77 , then  @xmath1 can not be @xmath46-minimal and we can cross out  @xmath1 from our list of suspects ( @xmath1 has an alibi ! ) .",
    "now , it is easily seen that all the suspects number  1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and  5 have an alibi : indeed , from figure  [ sospettia ] we see that  @xmath151 , since the set  @xmath1 occupies ( in measure , weighted by the kernel in  ) more then a halfplane passing through  @xmath69 : in figure  [ sospettia ] the point  @xmath69 is the big dot and the halfplane is marked by the line passing through it , so a quick inspection confirms that the alibis of number  1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and  5 check out , hence their nonlocal mean curvature does not vanish at  @xmath69 and consequently they are not @xmath46-minimal sets .    on the other hand ,",
    "the alibi of number  6 does nt hold water .",
    "indeed , near  @xmath69 , the set  @xmath1 is confined below the horizontal line , but at infinity the set  @xmath1 go well beyond such line : these effects might compensate each other and produce a vanishing mean curvature .    *",
    "# 1 *    so , having ruled out all the suspects but number  6 , we have only to remember what the old investigators have taught us ( e.g. , `` when you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth '' ) , to find that the only possible ( though , in principle , rather improbable ) culprit is number  6 .    of course",

    "we consider a diffeomorphism  @xmath153 , with  @xmath154 and we take  @xmath155 . by minimality , we know that  @xmath156 for every  @xmath157 , with  @xmath158 sufficiently small , hence @xmath159 suppose , for simplicity , that  @xmath160 , so that we can write @xmath161 moreover , if we use the notation  @xmath162 , we have that @xmath163 similarly , if  @xmath164 , we find that @xmath165 as a consequence , @xmath166 \\\\ & & \\qquad\\cdot\\big(1+{\\varepsilon}\\,{\\rm div}\\ , v(x)\\big ) \\big(1+{\\varepsilon}\\,{\\rm div}\\ , v(y)\\big)\\,dx\\,dy \\\\ & & \\qquad- \\iint_{e\\times e^c } \\frac{dx\\,dy}{|x - y|^{n+2s } } + o({\\varepsilon } ) \\\\ & = & -(n+2s)\\,{\\varepsilon}\\ , \\iint_{e\\times e^c } \\frac { ( x - y)\\cdot   \\big(v(x)-v(y)\\big ) } { |x - y|^{n+2s+2}}\\,dx\\,dy\\\\&&\\qquad+ { \\varepsilon}\\ , \\iint_{e\\times e^c } \\frac { { \\rm div}\\ , v(x)+{\\rm div}\\ , v(y ) } { |x - y|^{n+2s}}\\,dx\\,dy+o({\\varepsilon}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we point out that @xmath167 and so , interchanging the names of the variables , @xmath168 consequently , @xmath169\\,dx\\,dy+o({\\varepsilon } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , using the divergence theorem and changing the names of the variables we have that @xmath170\\\\ & = & \\int_{e^c}\\,dx \\left [ \\int_{\\partial e } \\frac{v(y)\\cdot\\nu(y)}{|x - y|^{n+2s}}\\,d{\\mathcal{h}}^{n-1}(y ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath171.\\ ] ] accordingly , we find that @xmath172 + o({\\varepsilon})\\\\ & = & { \\varepsilon}\\,\\int_{\\partial e }   v(y)\\cdot\\nu(y ) \\ , h_e^s(y ) \\,d{\\mathcal{h}}^{n-1}(y)+o({\\varepsilon}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with  , we see that @xmath173 and so , since  @xmath174 is an arbitrary vector field supported in  @xmath0 , the desired result follows .",

    "one uses the appropriate combination of two general facts : on the one hand , one can perturb a given set by a smooth flow and compare the energy at time  @xmath175 with the one at time  @xmath176 , thus obtaining a second order estimate ; on the other hand , the nonlocal interaction always charges a mass on points that are sufficiently close , thus providing a natural measure for the discrepancy between the original set and its flow .",
    "one can appropriately combining these two facts with the minimality ( or more generally , the stability ) property of a set . indeed , by choosing as smooth flow a translation near the origin , the above arguments lead to an integral estimate of the discrepancy between the set and its translations , which in turn implies a perimeter estimate .",
    "we now give the details of the proof of theorem  [ b v t ] .",

    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ 1123thj ] : as a matter of fact , the result proven is even stronger , since it says that , after removing horizontal and vertical slabs of size  @xmath353 , we have that  @xmath8 in  @xmath112 is a graph of oscillation bounded by  @xmath353 , see figure  [ ini2 ] ( in fact , more general statements and proofs can be find in  @xcite ) .",
    "the core of the proof of theorem  [ per ] consists in constructing a suitable barrier that can be slided `` from below '' and which exhibits the desired stickiness phenomenon : if this is possible , since the @xmath46-minimal surface can not touch the barrier , it has to stay above the barrier and stick at the boundary as well .",
    "so , the barrier we are looking for should have negative fractional mean curvature , coincide with  @xmath24 outside  @xmath121 and contain  @xmath354 .",
    "such barrier is constructed in  @xcite in an iterative way , that we now try to describe .",
