    "the unique complex of the industrial nuclear reactors is inside rock and a passive shielding from cosmic muons corresponds to 600 m.w.e . due to the muons flux",
    "is suppressed by a factor 1000 ; * the composition of a nuclear fuel in the reactor is such , that the difference between the real antineutrino spectrum and u-235 spectrum is less then 1% ; * the peroid  reactor - on  is equal to approximately 50 days and therefore one may measure the background each two months but not 1 - 1.5 years usual on power atomic station ."
