    "the enormous amount of data produced at the @xmath2 factories and the perspectives concerning future experiments with @xmath3 quarks will allow us to test the flavour non - diagonal sector of the standard model in a stringent way .",
    "however , aside from enough data on flavour changing decays this requires also a sufficient theoretical control in the calculation of the standard model predictions .",
    "the sensitivity to `` new physics effects '' is expected to be largest in channels which do not have a big standard model contribution .",
    "these are in particular the loop induced flavour changing neutral current processes such as @xmath4 transitions , which are suppressed by the gim mechanism .",
    "still there is also room for `` new physics effects '' in charged current processes , e.g. through the exchange of a heavy charged higgs particle .",
    "the theoretical description of semi - leptonic decays has become very precise over the last couple of years and seems to be under good control @xcite . in combination with the very large data sets from the @xmath2 factories this has led to precise determinations of of the ckm matrix elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 , assuming that the standard model is correct @xcite .    in turn",
    ", these data may also serve to test the standard model .",
    "the charged currents will allow us to test aspects of the standard model different from the ones governed by loop induced flavour changing neutral current processes .",
    "in particular , the detailed data on semileptonic @xmath2 decays are sensitive to the helicity structure of the underlying quark transition , such as right - handed , scalar or tensor charged currents",
    ".    the type of analysis we are suggesting here is well known in the context of leptonic muon and @xmath7 decays and is usually expressed as values or limits for the `` michel parameters '' @xcite . in the present paper we analyse",
    "the @xmath0 transition current along the same lines and discuss the sensitivity which can be obtained on new couplings on the basis of the precise data on spectral moments in inclusive semileptonic @xmath2 decays .",
    "the theoretical methods available for inclusive processes are in a mature state @xcite and we shall compute the corresponding differential rates using the @xmath8 expansion @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art analysis within the standard model involves terms up to and including the terms of the order @xmath9 @xcite , the ones of order @xmath10 @xcite and the next - to - leading qed and qcd radiative corrections to the leading ( partonic ) term @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we perform the analysis for general currents at the appropriate level of precision .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the relevant operators using an effective field theory language .",
    "this allows us to identify the structure of the operators and will give us a qualitative argument on the sizes of the different contributions . in section 3 the ope for the general interaction",
    "is performed , and in section 4 we discuss the radiative corrections to the leading term which is the partonic calculation .",
    "finally we perform a numerical analysis of the effects of non - standard model interactions on the moments of semileptonic decay spectra and conclude .",
    "since the standard model is the most general renormalizable theory with the observed particle spectrum and interactions , possible effects from physics beyond the standard model will show up as @xmath11 invariant operators of higher dimension , which are suppressed by powers of the new - physics scale .",
    "focussing on the quark sector the symmetries of the standard model enforce that the leading operators are of dimension 6 .",
    "the list of relevant operators has been given in @xcite and we shall use the notations of @xcite .",
    "the quark fields are grouped into    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are doublets under @xmath14 and @xmath15 are doublets under a ( explicitly broken ) @xmath16 .",
    "the higgs field and its charge conjugate are written as a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 transforming under @xmath19 .",
    "the potential of the higgs fields leads to a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the field @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath19 is broken by the yukawa couplings and the weak hypercharge down to the standard model symmetry @xmath21 ; however , keeping the notion of the larger @xmath19 symmetry is useful for bookkeeping reasons .",
    "the standard model is the most general renormalizable lagrangian with an @xmath22 symmetry and the phenomenologically correct particle content.this means that any effect from a high scale @xmath23 is suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath23 , and  in the sense of an effective field theory  we are led to consider operators of dimension higher than 4 .",
    "hence , at scales of the order of the weak scale we may write the lagrangian as an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath23 @xmath24 where the leading term is the standard model lagrangian @xmath25 . furthermore , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ... have to be invariant under the standard model symmetry @xmath21 .",
    "the next - to - leading terms in the @xmath28 expansion involve only dim-6 or higher operators , since for quarks there is no @xmath29 invariant dim-5 operator .",
    "the list of possible operators is sizable and can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "however , in the present paper we shall concentrate on semileptonic @xmath2 decays which restricts us to a smaller subgroup .",
    "it contains operators involving two quarks and gauge fields as well as four fermion operators , consisting of two quarks and two leptons .",
    "since we know from semileptonic @xmath7 decays that a possible contribution from a four fermion operator at the weak scale is likely to be small , we shall focus on the operators with two quarks and gauge fields .",
    "these two quark operators of dimension 6 may be classified according to the helicities of the quark fields , left - left ( ll ) , right - right ( rr ) and left - right ( lr ) . a full list of the relevant two quark operators can be found in @xcite where the following basis of operators has been suggested @xmath30 with @xmath31 and all coupling matrices @xmath32 being hermitian .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath33 have once again been included to break the custodial symmetry explicitly .    in the same spirit",
    "we define rr - operators @xmath34   f_{ab}^{(3)}\\,q_b \\\\ o^{(4)}_{rr } & = & \\bar{q}_a\\ , \\tau_3 \\fmslash{r } \\tau_3 f_{ab}^{(4 ) } \\,q_b\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and again hermitian coupling matrices @xmath36 .    using an odd number of higgs fields we can construct invariant lr operators @xmath37 with the coupling matrices",
    "@xmath38    after spontaneous symmetry breaking we want to consider the contributions of these operators to the charged current @xmath0 transitions .",
    "the relevant interactions are @xmath39 containing the couplings @xmath40 and the projectors @xmath41 .    including also the contribution from the standard model",
    "@xmath42 we get the generalized interaction as @xmath43    going to hadronic energy scales we also integrate out the weak bosons .",
    "since possible new physics contributions to the leptonic sector are strongly constrained , we shall use here only the standard model piece . integrating out the weak bosons",
    "amounts to the replacement @xmath44 from which we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the usual leptonic current and @xmath47 is the generalized hadronic @xmath0 current which is given by @xmath48 where we have renamed the coupling constants to streamline the notation , @xmath49 denotes the projector on positive / negative chirality and @xmath50 is the qcd covariant derivative .",
    "note that the term proportional to @xmath51 contains the standard model contribution .    in principle",
    "one could have written ( [ enhancedgamma ] ) from the start , but the derivation via an effective field theory approach allows us to consider the expected orders of magnitudes of the different contributions .",
    "note that the derivatives acting on the fields in ( [ specialbdecayl ] ) will yield momenta of the particles involved in the decay ( see ( [ enhancedgamma ] ) ) , and hence the typical scale which has to be assigned to these derivatives is the mass of the @xmath3 quark .",
    "furthermore , we have already included the corresponding inverse powers of @xmath52 in the definitions of the couplings @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    comparing ( [ enhancedgamma ] ) with ( [ specialbdecayl ] )",
    "we get an estimate for the orders of magnitudes @xmath55 where a possible overall loop factor @xmath56 has been omitted .",
    "we note further that in minimal flavour violating scenarios @xcite any occurrence of a right handed quark is related to a helicity flip and hence mass factors occur .",
    "while the above estimates remain the same for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the estimate for @xmath59 contains a strong additional suppression factor of @xmath60 .",
    "the additional factor @xmath61 in @xmath53 and @xmath54 reflects the fact that in order to obtain a helicity flip one has to have an additional yukawa coupling , making these contributions small compared to the helicity - conserving ones .",
    "in the ( differential ) rate the relevant contributions are the interference terms with the standard model piece .",
    "a coupling between left and right handed contributions requires to flip the helicity of the final state @xmath62 quark and hence an additional factor @xmath63 will appear in these contributions .    thus for the rates we obtain additional contributions of the orders @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while all other contributions will be too small to be relevant here",
    "the calculation of the differential rate proceeds along the same lines as the corresponding calculation in the standard model .",
    "the starting point is a correlator of the two hadronic currents    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the dirac matrix corresponding to ( [ enhancedgamma ] ) , @xmath69 is the four velocity of the decaying @xmath2 meson and @xmath70 is the momentum transferred to the leptons .",
    "this correlator may be decomposed into scalar form factors according to @xmath71    contracting the imaginary part of @xmath72 with the tensor @xmath73 obtained from the leptonic currents one obtains the differential decay rate @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the corresponding phase space element .",
    "as discussed above , we shall use the standard model expression for the leptonic side of the process . using the charged lepton energy @xmath76 , the neutrino energy @xmath77 and the leptonic invariant mass @xmath78 as independent variables one obtains for the triply differential rate @xmath79\\ ] ] in the following calculation we shall adopt the notations of @xcite .",
    "bcb    ( 150,75 )    the tree - level expansion in @xmath8 is most easily set up along the lines described in @xcite . in the feynman diagram shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : feyn : tree ] , the double line denotes the propagator of a charm quark which propagating in the background field of the soft gluons of the @xmath2 meson @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the background gluon field .",
    "the ope of the forward scattering amplitude is obtained by multiplying ( [ bgfprop ] ) by the appropriate dirac structures for the currents ( see ( [ enhancedgamma ] ) and by expanding ( [ bgfprop ] ) to third order in @xmath83 @xmath84 keeping track of the ordering of the covariant derivatives .",
    "the remaining task is to evaluate the matrix elements of operators of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the full qcd field .",
    "this is done most conveniently in a recursive fashion as described in @xcite .",
    "expanding to @xmath87 requires the two well known matrix elements of dimension 5 , which are the kinetic energy parameter @xmath88 and the chromomagnetic moment @xmath89 @xmath90    the dim-4 matrix elements contain only a single derivative , while the dim-3 contributions have no derivative .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of @xmath88 , @xmath89 up to @xmath91 accuracy .",
    "the relevant general matrix elements are @xcite @xmath92 ,   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\langle b(p ) | \\bar{b}_v ( id^\\rho ) b_v | b(p ) \\rangle = -\\frac{m_b}{2 m_b } p_+    \\bigg\\lbrace v^\\rho   ( \\mu^2_g-\\mu_\\pi^2 ) \\bigg",

    "we evaluate the scalar components of the correlator @xmath72 given in ( [ hadcorr ] ) .",
    "although it is straightforward to compute all contributions we shall give here only the ones which can be expected to be sizable , these are the interferences with the standard model contribution .",
    "we write @xmath93 where all scalar components have an expansion in @xmath8 according to @xmath94    for the standard model contribution this expansion has be performed already to @xmath10 @xcite , while for the new physics contributions it is sufficient to retain the tree level terms , since the nonperturbative corrections at least to the low moments are tiny @xcite .",
    "more relevant are the qcd radiative corrections which we shall consider in the next section .      alphas    the main corrections to the non - standard model contributions is due to qcd radiative effects , since at the current level of precision the non - perturbative corrections are too small to be relevant .",
    "hence we consider now the order @xmath95 radiative corrections , which are computed by evaluating the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn : alphas ] .",
    "note that the scalar current involves also an effective quark - quark - gluon - boson vertex in order to maintain qcd gauge invariance .",
    "taking the imaginary part at the end implements the various cuts of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn : alphas ] corresponding to real and virtual radiation .",
    "the standard model contribution involves only left handed currents and has been computed already long ago in @xcite .",
    "the left handed current is a dim-3 operator and has a vanishing anomalous dimension ; hence the standard model calculation for the sum of the real and the virtual radiation yields an ultraviolet finite result .",
    "as discussed above , the non - standard model operators correspond to dim-6 operators , but after spontaneous symmetry breaking the operators may be treated as dim-3 or dim-4-operators as far as the qcd corrections are concerned .    for the right handed current the same argument holds as for the left handed current .",
    "it is also a dim-3 operator and is conserved ; thus the anomalous dimension vanishes and the sum of the real and the virtual qcd corrections is ultraviolet finite .",
    "the tensor and the scalar operators connect different helicities and thus they contain only a single power of the weak vev and in addition one derivative .",
    "consequently , from the qcd point - of - view they are dim-4 operators which renormalize in qcd .    however , we are interested only in the qcd effects on the shape of the spectra and hence the virtual corrections do not play a role , since they only renormalize the tree level result .",
    "in particular , the partonic mass moments @xmath96 ( with @xmath97 ) do not have a tree level contribution ( and hence no contribution from virtual qcd corrections ) , since the tree level rate is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "hence we need to compute only the contributions to the real radiation and can ignore - at least for this purpose - the question of the renormalization of the helicity - changing operators .",
    "the new physics contributions will have an impact on the shapes of the spectra of the hadronic and leptonic energies as well as on the spectrum of the hadronic invariant mass .",
    "it is instructive to first take a look at the tree level results for the charged lepton energy spectrum . using the variable @xmath99 we write the different contributions as @xmath100 where the superscript denotes the different contributions according to the coupling constants as defined in ( [ enhancedgamma ] ) .",

    "[ fig : spectra ] we show the effect of the additional contributions in the hadronic current at tree level .",

    "thus if the moments can be determined at the level of a few percent this would result in a determination of the non - standard couplings at a similar level .",
    "however , a precise statement concerning the precision of an extraction of a non - standard model coupling is difficult , since a full analysis requires a combined fit of all the parameters , including the heavy quark parameters and heavy quark masses , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this paper we have computed the effect of a non - standard coupling for the @xmath0 transition in a semileptonic decay , assuming that the leptonic current is purely left handed .",
    "the latter assumption is well justified by the data on purely leptonic processes , in particular the muon decay .",
    "although the calculation of nonperturbative effects for these non - standard couplings is straightforward , the main corrections are the perturbative qcd effects , which are sizable and have to be taken into account . due to the vanishing anomalous dimension of the left and the right handed currents the qcd effects are finite for these currents ; however , additional work is required to compute the virtual corrections to the scalar and tensor currents , which renormalize under qcd .",
    "fortunately , these virtual corrections do not change the shape of the spectra and thus statements about moments are still possible .",
    "on general grounds one would not expect new physics to show up in a charged current interaction , but this may as well be a false prejudice . at least from the generic point of view the most general parametrizations in terms of dimension six operators allow new physics effects in charged currents . as an example for a model one can consider a multi - higgs model , where a charged higgs boson would induce an effect in a charged current already at tree level .",
    "the effect of non - standard couplings on the moments can be sizable and thus this method opens a road to constrain possible new physics effects in charged current interactions .",
    "however , a detailed analysis needs a combined fit of all parameters in the heavy quark expansion , including the quark masses and the heavy quark expansion parameters , and the additional results given in this paper will allow us to perform such a fit .      when this paper was almost completed a parallel computation",
