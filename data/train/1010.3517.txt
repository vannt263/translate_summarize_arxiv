    "recently , the observational study of the cosmic star formation history has been at the center of our efforts to understand the evolution and the formation of galaxies .",
    "this is because the observational data play a key role in constraining physical processes governing the evolutionary history of galaxies on which outcomes of the theoretical predictions are strongly dependent .",
    "many studies have been carried out to derive star formation rates in distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , there is a major obstacle in such efforts - the dust extinction of the light coming from star formation .",
    "since the discovery of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) , it has been recognized that a significant portion of the light from the star formation is missing in the optical / ultraviolet but emitted in infrared ( ir ) . therefore , statistical studies of infrared luminous galaxies to reveal the hidden cosmic star formation activities were major themes of the more recent infrared space telescope missions such as the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , the _ spitzer _ space telescope , and the _ akari _ space telescope .",
    "such studies found that the star formation at higher redshifts ( @xmath10 ) are more obscured than at @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) underlining the importance of infrared - based studies of galaxies .",
    "however , due to the lack of efficient coverage between 10 to 20 @xmath3 in the _ spitzer _ imaging , comparison of the same rest - frame mid - infrared ( mir ) quantities over a wide redshift range is not possible to further examine the usefulness of the mir star formation indicators at various redshifts and the correlation between the star formation and the relative strengths of mir spectroscopic features made by molecules such as polyaromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) and silicates .",
    "the additional mir coverage at 10 to 20 @xmath3 is also advantageous in studying the mir - excess emission in early - type galaxies @xcite , and the identification of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ akari _ satellite is an infrared space telescope launched in february 2006 . by offering a contiguous , wide - field imaging capability in the wavelength range between 2.5 and 26@xmath3 , _ akari _",
    "complements the capability of the _ spitzer _ space telescope , and provides an unprecedented view of the universe , especially at 11 and 15@xmath3 .",
    "because of the sun - synchronous orbit of _ akari _ , deep observations can be done only at the north and the south ecliptic poles .",
    "therefore , the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) survey is one of the important extragalactic surveys of _ akari_. the nep survey has two major programs , nep - wide and nep - deep surveys .",
    "the nep - wide field covers 5.8 deg@xmath2 centered at nep , whereas the nep - deep field covers 0.38 deg@xmath2 with deeper exposures than the nep - wide .",
    "due to the wide field , the contiguous mir wavelength coverage , and the low extinction value of @xmath12 at the center of nep @xcite , the nep - wide field is unique for the studies of the extragalactic objects like infrared luminous galaxies and agns . for further information about nep surveys",
    ", the readers can refer to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "optical imaging data can enhance the value of the unique _ akari _ nep survey . since _",
    "akari _ has a low spatial resolution ( the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) is about 6@xmath9 at 15@xmath3 ) , the optical imaging with a higher resolution can help improving the astrometric accuracy and help deblending confused objects . also , the optical bands are important to construct multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of infrared sources such as galaxies and agns to understand their properties . there already exist deep optical data covering 2 deg@xmath2 of the central region of the nep - wide field , obtained by the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 filters @xcite . however , there is no deep optical data for the remaining nep - wide area .",
    "the digitized sky survey images are available , but neither their depths nor spatial resolutions are sufficient ( the depth is about 20 mag at @xmath15 and the seeing is about 3@xmath9 with pixel scale of 1.0@xmath9 at the nep area ) for identifying optical counterparts of many infrared sources . hence , we observed this remaining nep - wide area in optical @xmath16 , and @xmath17 filters .",
    "the @xmath18 filters were chosen because we needed a multiple color set at least three colors to construct the optical part of the sed of galaxy ; one blue part , one red part , and a middle part between red and infrared bands . also , those bessell filters are wider than the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filters , enabling us to achieve a higher signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) per unit exposure time than the sdss filters . throughout the paper",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath19 and @xmath20 = 70 km s@xmath21mpc@xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also use the ab magnitude system .",
    "the _ akari _ nep - wide field is centered at @xmath22 covering a circular area of 5.8 deg@xmath2 .",
    "our optical @xmath18 imaging survey covers 4.9 deg@xmath2 outside the central 2 deg@xmath2 area of the _ akari _ nep - wide .",

    "the small squares show the maidanak optical imaging area .",
    "it consists of 70 subfields , each of them having an @xmath23 field of view .",
    "these maidanak fields are grouped into 4 different sections , east ( 8 fields ) , west ( 7 fields ) , north ( 23 fields ) , and south ( 32 fields ) , and we name each subfield with e01e08 , w01w08 , n01n23 , and s01s32 .",
    "the names of the subfields and their central positions are listed in table [ tbl0 ] .",
    "the images were obtained in bessell @xmath24 , @xmath15 , and @xmath17 filters from 2007 june 12 to august 5 at the maidanak observatory in uzbekistan , using the seoul national university 4k @xmath4 4k camera ( snucam ) on the 1.5 m richey - chretien , azt-22 telescope @xcite .",
    "the ccd camera has a 4096 @xmath4 4096 format and a pixel scale of 0.266@xmath9 at f/7.75 .",
    "we used the four amplifier mode for the ccd image readout .",
    "twilight flats were taken at the start and the end of each night when possible . since the @xmath1band images are found to have complicated fringe patterns , all of the @xmath1band images were dithered by @xmath620@xmath9 in random directions .",
    "these dithered images were used to construct the master fringe image .",
    "for photometric calibration , we observed photometric standard fields from @xcite at two different altitudes at least . in most subfields ,",
    "standard star images were obtained on the same night , but in a few cases no corresponding standard star observations were carried out due to bad weather . in such cases ,",
    "the photometric calibration was done using a different way , as described in section [ sec : calib ] .",
    "table [ tbl1 ] summarizes our observations . for each filter ,",
    "typical total exposure times are 21 min in @xmath24 , 30 min in @xmath15 , and 20 min in @xmath17 filter .",
    "the images for a given subfield and a given filter were obtained mostly on a single night so that images are in homogeneous quality at least for a single filter of a given subfield .",
    "there are a few exceptions to this rule ( 3 subfields for @xmath25band and 13 subfields for @xmath1band ) .",
    "this happened when we needed to take images of a given subfield and a given filter over two nights due to observational constraints such as the lack of the observing time ( e.g. , the night was ending before finishing all the images of the subfield ) , or a rapidly deteriorating weather or seeing . in some cases , the total exposure times and the number of images of each subfield were adjusted to the weather conditions .",
    "for example , when there were thin clouds in the sky , the exposure time or the number of images were increased to compensate for the loss of the s / n .",
    "the frame times for individual exposures were also adjusted .",
    "shorter exposure times ( 2 minutes ) were used when there were no guide stars , or the weather condition was varying too rapidly .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath8band images were mostly taken during the same nights under dark / grey sky to provide images with similar seeing values , but the @xmath1band images were taken mostly during the bright time since the depth of @xmath1band images is the least influenced by the presence of the moon among the @xmath18 filters . the seeing condition for each subfield was determined as the median value of fwhm of non - saturated point sources with the magnitudes between 13 and 15 mag . in general , the seeing fwhm values of the stacked @xmath8band and @xmath1band images are stable at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , but there were more variations in the seeing conditions in @xmath25band and the @xmath25band images have the worst seeing fwhm values in general among the @xmath18 filters .",
    "the maximum and the minimum seeing values among the @xmath18 filter images of a given subfield differ by a factor of 1.5 in median , but in extreme cases , the difference could be as large as a factor of @xmath62 due to deteriorated seeing conditions in the @xmath25band .",
    "the 5@xmath7 detection limits of each subfield were determined from the sky background sigma , within an aperture diameter of 3 times fwhm value .",
    "the detection limits vary from subfield to subfield , but the median 5@xmath7 detection limit in @xmath8band is 23.1 mag .",
    "table [ tbl2 ] lists the seeings and 5@xmath7 depths for each subfield .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the seeing and the 5@xmath7 detection limit of the three filters for each subfield .",
    "we used iraf ` noao.imred.ccdred ` package to process raw images .",
    "the data were processed with usual reduction procedures such as bias subtractions using a combined bias image and flat - field correction using twilight flat of each night .",
    "dark correction was unnecessary since there is virtually no dark current in the images taken with our ccd camera .    because the bias subtraction and the flat fielding could not remove the amplifier bias level variations perfectly due to small temporal variations in the bias level , some of the preprocessed images show slightly different bias levels in different quadrants , each representing a section of image read by a single amplifier . to remove this pattern , we determined the background values of the 4 quadrants , and subtracted the differences between the background levels of the 4 quadrant images from each quadrant .",
    "then the background levels are normalized to the background level of a quadrant with the lowest background value .",
    "we removed the fringe pattern in @xmath1band following the steps below .",
    "first , we created a master fringe image combining all @xmath1band images ( 716 images ) in median .",
    "then , before subtracting the master fringe frame , we re - scaled the master fringe frame by an appropriate factor .",
    "this scaling factor is taken as the ratio of the median background value of each science image to the master fringe frame background value . finally , we subtracted the re - scaled master fringe frame from each @xmath1band image .",
    "we checked the difference in image quality before and after the fringe removal . before the fringe pattern removal",
    ", the large scale fringe pattern varies @xmath28 of the background level which is comparable to the sky sigma value per pixel .",
    "after the fringe subtraction , the large scale variation is reduced to @xmath29 of the background or more than 6 times less than the sky sigma value , showing that the fringe pattern is removed successfully well below the sky sigma values .    after the fringe correction and the registration , all images were combined in median .",
    "cosmic rays are removed during the stacking of multiple images with a sigma clipping adopting + 3-sigma for rejecting outlier pixels .",
    "to derive astrometry solutions , we used a software named scamp which finds astrometry solution by cross - matching automatically an input reference catalog containing a set of accurate ra and dec values of sources against a list of object positions obtained from an input fits image @xcite . in our case , we used usno - b1 catalog @xcite as the reference catalog for the astrometry calibration . astrometry solutions were derived for all the stacked , subfield images in each filter separately .",
    "the degree of the polynomial for distortion correction is adopted to be 4 , since it gave the best solution among other options .",
    "scamp can refine the astrometry solution by comparing positions of objects in overlapping images , but the procedure does not apply to our case .    to check the accuracy of the astrometry solution , we compared our catalog with the usno - b1 catalog stars that had the positional errors of @xmath30 0.2@xmath9 and the apparent magnitudes of 14 @xmath31 mag @xmath30 19 .",
    "figure [ fig3]-(a ) shows the distribution of the differences in position between the usno - b1 stars and the corresponding objects in our catalog in ra and dec directions .",
    "figures [ fig3]-(b ) and ( c ) show the histograms of the astrometric differences between our catalog and usno - b1 catalog of ra and dec , respectively . to derive the astrometry error",
    ", we fit the histogram of the astrometric differences with gaussian functions .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the best - fit gaussian function to the distributions . after the fitting , we find that the 1@xmath7 astrometric errors are 0.16@xmath9 for ra and 0.15@xmath9 for dec .",
    "we carried out the photometry calibration using three methods depending on the availability of the standard star data .",
    "the first method uses the landolt standard stars @xcite .",
    "this procedure applies to 25 fields in @xmath25band , 25 fields in @xmath8band , and 18 fields in @xmath1band , where the standard star data were taken at two different altitudes at the least .",
    "the adopted standard calibration formula is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an instrumental magnitude ( @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is a standard magnitude , @xmath38 is a zero point , @xmath39 is an airmass coefficient , and @xmath40 is an airmass .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were measured within an aperture of a 12@xmath9 diameter on the standard stars .",
    "we checked with growth curves that this aperture is large enough to contain virtually all photons from the star irrespective of the seeing of our data .",
    "we chose the standard stars that have similar colors for deriving the coefficients of the above formula . to confirm the effect of not including the color terms",
    ", we checked the difference between the listed magnitudes of standard stars with various colors ( those not included in the derivation of the photometric zero - points ) and the magnitudes of these standard stars derived with our photometry solutions .",
    "we find that the rms difference is less than 0.05 mag .",
    "that is , the magnitudes derived with our photometry solutions are independent of the color terms well within the error 0.05 mag .",
    "this is consistent with the expected variation in the photometric zero points due to neglecting the color term , based on an observational campaign of photometry standards using the snucam at maidanak @xcite .",
    "therefore we decided to neglect the color term of the formula .",
    "we found @xmath38 and @xmath39 values for each night and each filter , and derived the standard magnitudes of the objects using these values .",
    "the @xmath38 has the values in the range of 1.67 @xmath41 0.13 at @xmath25band , 1.70 @xmath41 0.11 at @xmath8band , and 2.07 @xmath41 0.08 at @xmath1band .",
    "also , the @xmath39 have the values of 0.33 @xmath41 0.05 at @xmath25band , 0.10 @xmath41 0.03 at @xmath8band , and 0.04 @xmath41 0.01 at @xmath1band . these values are consistent with values derived from a campaign observation of standard stars @xcite .",
    "the zero - point errors were estimated from the rms magnitude differences between the known magnitudes of the standard stars and the magnitudes of the same standard stars derived from our zero - point solution .",
    "the zero - point error is about 0.032 mag using this method .",
    "the second photometric calibration method is adopted for the data taken during the nights which have only one altitude data for standard stars ( 34 , 40 , and 27 fields at @xmath25 , @xmath8 , and @xmath1band , respectively . ) . in such cases ,",
    "we used other night s @xmath39 value since the night - to - night variation in @xmath39 is not significant .",
    "this produces an additional zero - point error of 0.028 mag , at most .",
    "consequently , the total error associated with the zero - point determination of the second photometric calibration method is less than 0.040 mag .",
    "the third method of the photometric calibration is applied to the subfields without associated standard star observations .",
    "for such fields ( 11 , 5 , and 25 fields in @xmath25 , @xmath8 , and @xmath1band , respectively . ) , we used photometry of sources in the overlapping area of a neighbor subfield .",
    "the corresponding sources that have magnitudes between 12 and 16 mag were used to measure the photometric zero - point . for this method ,",
    "the zero - point error was derived from the standard deviation of the magnitude offset between the sources in the field where we want to determine the photometric zero - point and the matched sources in the neighbor fields . in this case , the zero - point error is about 0.045 mag with respect to the photometry of the neighbor field .",
    "therefore , the total error in the zero - point for the third method is about 0.0320.045 mag , depending on the method used for the photometry calibration of the neighbor field .",
    "we checked the consistency of our photometric calibration using an overlap area between two neighboring fields ( those that were not used for the photometric calibration of the other field ) . in the case of the first method ,",
    "the mean photometry differences are @xmath42 0.028 mag in @xmath24 ( 30 fields for overlaps ) , 0.002 @xmath41 0.033 mag in @xmath15 ( 23 fields for overlaps ) , and 0.001 @xmath41 0.017 mag in @xmath17 magnitudes ( 17 fields for overlaps ) . in the case of the second method , the mean",
    "photometry differences are about 0.002 @xmath41 0.030 mag in @xmath24 ( 37 fields for overlaps ) , @xmath42 0.040 mag in @xmath15 ( 44 fields for overlaps ) , and @xmath43 0.035 mag in @xmath17 magnitudes ( 20 fields for overlaps ) .",
    "note that the consistency of our photometric calibration between different nights are well below 0.05 mag for all filters which is expected from the zero - point errors .",
    "the @xmath44 for each subfield are listed in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "for the nights which have the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 values , the @xmath44 means @xmath45 , i.e. the zero point for converting dn per exposure time to magnitude , including the airmass correction .",
    "therefore we can determine the apparent magnitude @xmath46 , through @xmath47 @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath44 can be used for the purpose of checking the depth of each subfield .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows several depths of each subfield for the three filters . for each subfield",
    ", the depth are checked using the 5@xmath7 detection limit , the 50@xmath48 completeness ( see section [ sec : comple ] ) , the 99@xmath48 reliability ( see section [ sec : reli ] ) , or the @xmath44 , as well as the total exposure time .",
    "sextractor @xcite was used for the detection and the photometry of objects in the images .",
    "we stacked @xmath5 , and @xmath1band images together , and used the @xmath18 stacked image as our object detection image .",
    "after many trials of sextractor parameter sets and examining the detected and the non - detected sources by eye , we chose a set of 1.2@xmath7 for detect_thresh , 5 connected pixels for detect_minarea , deblend_nthresh of 64 , deblend_mincont of 0.005 , 200 for back_size , and 3 for back_filtersize as the optimal set of detection parameters . lowering",
    "the detection limit produced too many spurious detections and increasing the detection limit tend to miss obvious sources .",
    "the adopted detection limit corresponds to the s /",
    "n of about 4.5 which is usually an optimal s / n limit for detection of objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to cross - identify and perform the photometry of objects in each band , we used the assoc parameter in sextractor with a matching radius of 0.658@xmath9 , 3@xmath7 value of the astrometric error .",
    "the above process may miss faint objects which are brighter in a particular filter than the others . to supplement the above source detection , we also ran sextractor on images in each filter separately .",
    "this process reveals faint sources detected in a single filter image , but not detected in the @xmath18 stacked image .",
    "these sources detected in a single filter image were also matched with detections in other single filter images with the matching radius of 0.658@xmath9 . adding these faint sources , we detected 63,333 for @xmath24 , 96,460 for @xmath15 and 70,492 sources for @xmath17 filter over the reliability of 99@xmath48 ( see section [ sec : reli ] ) . among these objects , 16@xmath48 in @xmath24 , 33@xmath48 in @xmath15 , and 15@xmath48 in @xmath17 are detected only in the single filter images .",
    "we derived aperture magnitudes using an aperture of diameter of 3 times fwhm and auto magnitudes with kron - like elliptical apertures @xcite which are taken as the total magnitudes .",
    "the aperture correction value is 0.10 @xmath41 0.02 mag for all the filters and all the subfields .",
    "the magnitude errors are computed by combining the standard sextractor estimates and the zero - point errors we estimated .",
    "the standard sextractor error estimates are based on the poisson statistics , and could underestimate the noise values when the sky noises in adjoining pixels are correlated due to the stacking of the dithered frames @xcite . using a similar procedure described in @xcite , we calculated how the error within a square aperture of @xmath49 pixels , @xmath50 , changes as a function of @xmath51 . in the case where each pixel noise is uncorrelated with each other , @xmath52 . when the noise is correlated , the exponent of @xmath51 is greater than 1 . in our data ,",
    "we find @xmath53 . for a magnitude measured within an aperture with 3.0@xmath9 diameter ( 3 times a typical fwhm of our image ) ,",
    "there are about 110 pixels ( or @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , the photometric errors of faint objects ( @xmath55 mag ) could be underestimated by as much as about a factor of 1.4 . for the brighter objects ( @xmath56 mag ) ,",
    "the photometric errors are not affected by this effect , since their errors are dominated by the object noise .",
    "for the same object that exist on two or more fields in the overlapping areas , we chose an object that had the smallest flags value from sextractor ( the flags has a nonzero value if the object is blended , saturated , and/or truncated at an edge of a image ) and the smallest photometric error . among the same objects",
    ", we only included the one with a better s / n or image quality in the final catalog .",

    "the photometry is free from saturation and non - linearity above @xmath15 @xmath57 12 mag .",
    "we cut off the faint sources over the magnitude of false detection rate 1@xmath48 ( see section [ sec : reli ] ) .",
    "we found spurious detections due to the reflection halos caused by the bright objects and due to faint , uncorrected fringe patterns in @xmath8band images . in case of the reflection halos around bright stars",
    ", we divided the bright stars into three classes , and set a radius to define the region where spurious detections lie within it ( 120@xmath9 at 8 @xmath58 mag @xmath30 10 , 80@xmath9 at 10 @xmath59 mag @xmath30 12 , 40@xmath9 at 12 @xmath59 mag @xmath30 14 ) .",
    "we flag detections inside these radii as ` near@xmath60bright@xmath60obj ' , since they are likely to be spurious detections or their photometry are not reliable .",
    "we also found many spurious detections in the outer regions of stacked @xmath8band images , thus we flag objects that are not matched with @xmath25 or @xmath1band catalogs and exist within 30@xmath9 from the edge as ` near@xmath60edge ' .",
    "we found 5,186 ( 5@xmath48 ) of ` near@xmath60bright@xmath60obj ' at @xmath8band and 14,833 ( 15@xmath48)of ` near@xmath60edge ' sources , and checked those spurious sources by eyes .",

    "the flags are marked at the last column of the catalog ( table [ tbl3 ] ) .",
    "to distinguish stellar sources from other extragalactic sources , we used a @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 color - color diagram and the sextractor stellarity index .",
    "here , the stellarity indices measure the likelihood of a source being a point source or an extended source , with the value of 1 for a perfect point source , and 0 for a diffuse , extended source . the stellarities are measured from the single - filter stacked images . however , when we determine whether a source is point - like or extended , we adopted the stellarity value measured in a stacked image in the filter where the photometric error of the source is the smallest .",
    "note that the stellarity values are nearly identical among different filter images when an object is sufficiently bright ( @xmath63 mag ) .",

    "also , in order to identify bright , extended sources ( namely , low redshift galaxies ) in the stellar region on the color - color plot , we apply a stellarity cut where stellarity index has a value between 1 ( point sources ) and 0 ( extended sources ) .    in summary",
    ", we define stellar sources as the following :    objects with @xmath76 mag and the stellarity index @xmath77 0.2 or + objects with @xmath78 mag and the stellarity index @xmath77 0.8 or + if there is no @xmath62 color available , stellarity index @xmath77 0.8    the first condition weeds out extended objects at low redshift , while the second condition allows us to select clear , point sources in the region of galaxies on the color - color magnitude .",
    "the third criterion applies to a small number of objects near the detection limit of optical images , since @xmath70 and @xmath66 images show detections of 98@xmath48 and 77@xmath48 of objects brighter than the magnitude cut of the catalog at 50@xmath48 completeness limit .",

    "is dominated by the detections performed on the single filter image ( @xmath88 of the faintest sources of @xmath8band are detected only in the single filter image ) rather than the @xmath18 stacked images , we computed the completeness using the @xmath25 , @xmath8 , and @xmath1band single filter images of each subfield , to examine the completeness of the source detection . to estimate the completeness , we created artificial objects for each magnitude bin from 12 to 23.5 mag and placed them randomly in the background regions of the single filter images .",
    "the artificial objects are made of 100 point sources and 100 extended sources where the elliptical galaxies account for 40@xmath48 of the extended sources .",
    "these artificial objects are created using the ` noao.artdata ` package of the iraf . after performing detection and photometry of these artificial sources with the same parameter setting as those applied to the actual images , we calculated the completeness , which is defined as the ratio of the number of detected artificial sources to the number of input objects for each magnitude bin . figure [ fig7 ] shows the completeness of @xmath0 , and @xmath1 band data .",
