    "magnetic nanopillars can be fabricated @xcite , which offer interesting opportunities for direct comparison with numerical models . in the application discussed here ,",
    "the pillars are grown perpendicular to a surface . for an applied field parallel to the long axis of the pillar ,",
    "there exists a stable free - energy minimum when the field is parallel to the average magnetization of the pillar , and a metastable minimum for the antiparallel orientation .",
    "magnetization reversal involves a transition from the metastable minimum to the stable minimum across a saddle point in the free energy .",
    "it is the free - energy difference between the saddle point and the metastable minimum that determines the switching time of the pillar . while determining the magnetization of the metastable minimum is comparatively easy , the magnetization of the saddle point is more difficult to determine .",
    "projective dynamics ( pd ) is a technique that has proven capable of finding the saddle point in other magnetization - reversal systems @xcite .",
    "in order for the proper dynamics to emerge , the magnetization of the simulated pillar must be discretized on a sufficiently fine scale .",
    "pillar models that have previously been studied by projective dynamics consisted only of a one - dimensional chain of spins @xcite .",
    "this model lacks richer dynamics , such as magnetization curling modes , that are seen in experiments and in more realistic models .",
    "in addition , the dependence of the switching field on the angle of misalignment between the pillar axis and the applied field observed in the one - dimensional model @xcite does not correspond to that seen in the experimental pillars @xcite .    to achieve more realistic dynamics , a model pillar with physical dimensions 10 nm @xmath0 10 nm @xmath0",
    "150 nm was discretized onto a 6 @xmath0 6 @xmath0 90 cubic lattice .",
    "the model parameters were chosen to be consistent with bulk iron : exchange length of 2.6 nm and magnetization density of 1700 emu/@xmath1 .",
    "the temperature was fixed at 20 k.    the dynamics of the system are governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite , @xmath2\\right ) , \\label{eq : m}\\ ] ] which describes the time evolution of the magnetization in the presence of a local field . here",
    "@xmath3 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio with a value of @xmath4 hz / oe , and @xmath5 is a phenomenological damping parameter , chosen as 0.1 to give underdamped behavior .",
    "@xmath6 is the magnetization density at position @xmath7 , with a constant magnitude @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the total local field at @xmath7 .",
    "the latter contains contributions from the dipole - dipole interactions , exchange interactions , and the applied field .",
    "a reversal simulation begins with the magnetization oriented along the long axis of the pillar in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "it is allowed to relax in the presence of a field @xmath11 before the field is quickly switched to @xmath12 , where @xmath13  oe has been chosen smaller than the coercive field .",
    "-axis for a 6@xmath06@xmath090 pillar .",
    "grow / shrink data were collected into 6000 bins , which span the entire magnetization axis , [ -1,1 ] .",
    "the simulation was run at 20 k , 1125 oe , and the applied field was directed along the long axis of the pillar , antiparallel to the initial magnetization .",
    "the continuous curves represent nine - point running averages ]    projective dynamics involves analyzing the probability of growing toward the stable equilibrium or shrinking away from it , as a function of a single variable that measures the progress of the reversal process . to collect growing and shrinking statistics here ,",
    "the @xmath14-component of the total magnetization of the pillar , @xmath15 , was recorded at each integration step .",
    "in addition , the change in this value from the previous integration step , @xmath16 , was also recorded .",
    "the magnetization axis was discretized into bins into which the collected data were sorted .",
    "the bin size was determined such that the discretized @xmath16 would only involve changes between adjacent bins .",
    "the growing and shrinking probabilities were calculated by counting the number of times that @xmath16 would cause the magnetization to change bins .",
    "define @xmath17 as the number of times the magnetization hopped to the next bin in the direction toward equilibrium , and @xmath18 as the number of hops in the direction back toward the metastable state .",
    "if @xmath19 is the total number of visits to the starting bin , then the growing and shrinking probabilities for each bin , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , can be written respectively as    @xmath22    the crossings of the growing and shrinking probabilities give information about the locations of the metastable free - energy minimum and the saddle point .",
    "where the two probabilities are equal , the system has no preferred direction of magnetization evolution , indicating that the free - energy landscape is flat in this region .",
    "this is the location of an extremum .",
    "the right - hand intersection in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] corresponds to the metastable free - energy minimum , where the system spends most of its time . at the saddle point , the growing and shrinking probabilities are also equal , as indicated by the left - hand crossing .",
    "the region between these two crossings shows a higher probability for shrinkage than growth , corresponding a preference for moving toward the metastable minimum .",
    "previous simulations performed on a one - dimensional chain of seventeen spins exhibited stoner - wohlfarth behavior for the angular dependence of the switching field @xcite .",
    "this is not representative of experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , a full three - dimensional model qualitatively produced the proper angular dependence @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the full three - dimensional model allows for magnetization curling modes which are simply not allowed in the one - dimensional model .",
    "pd has previously been applied to the one - dimensional spin chain @xcite , but several thousand switches had to be performed in order to accumulate sufficient statistics to reveal the free - energy extrema @xcite . with typical switches taking around 1500  cpu - hours for the full three - dimensional model , it was not clear that sufficient statistics could be generated .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the results collected from only 20 switches for the full model .",
    "the estimated @xmath20 is shown as circles , and @xmath21 as crosses .",
    "scatter in these data is primarily due to the counting statistics and the small number of samples in each bin .",
    "nine - point running averages are used to reduce the scatter and improve estimates of the crossings of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the running averages are represented by curves and are sufficient to determine the locations of the extrema with an uncertainty of about @xmath23 in the magnetization . for the one - dimensional model the estimated curves representing @xmath20 and @xmath21 are almost parallel near the saddle point , making it difficult to locate crossings of the growing and shrinking probabilities ( see fig .  1 of ref .",
    "since they cross at a significant angle for the model studied here ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , it is possible to find an estimate for the magnetization of the free - energy saddle point from far fewer switches than were needed for the one - dimensional model .",
    "the projective dynamics method was used to produce growing and shrinking probabilities during the magnetization reversal of a realistic model nanopillar .",
    "these probabilities can be used to locate the magnetization of the free - energy extrema . in particular , the magnetization of the saddle point is revealed .",
    "compared to the one - dimensional model , far fewer switches are needed to find the location of the extrema in the three - dimensional model . in the future , a study of the dependence of the saddle point on temperature and misalignment between the pillar and the applied field are planned .",
