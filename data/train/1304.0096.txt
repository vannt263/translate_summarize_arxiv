    "the swiss geometer j.  steiner posed the following question ( `` combinatorische aufgabe '' ) in 1853 :    `` welche zahl , @xmath0 , von elementen hat die eigenschaft , dass sich die elemente so zu dreien ordnen lassen , dass je zwei in einer , aber nur in einer verbindung vorkommen ? ''",
    "if we write @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 instead of @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively , then we arrive at the following contemporary definition : a _ steiner system _",
    "@xmath6 is a finite set @xmath7 of elements ( called _ points _ ) with a distinguished family of subsets ( called _ blocks _ ) such that the following holds true :    1 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath1 points in @xmath7 .",
    "each block has exactly @xmath2 elements .",
    "any @xmath3 distinct points belong to a unique block .    in order to avoid trivialities",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath8 .",
    "so steiner asked for @xmath9 systems .",
    "as a matter of fact , t.p .",
    "kirkman proved already in 1847 that an @xmath9 exists if , and only if , @xmath10 .    in this short communication",
    "we present another proof for the existence of a steiner system @xmath11 which is also called _ small witt design _ @xmath12 .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite , in particular chapter iv .",
    "there the reader will also find the definition of a _",
    "@xmath3-design _ ( which is more general than that of a steiner system ) and references on other results mentioned in this section .    in an @xmath11",
    "there are twelve points , each block has exactly six elements , and any five distinct points are contained in a unique block .",
    "there is a unique @xmath11 up to isomorphism .",
    "the same uniqueness property holds true for an @xmath13 which carries the name _ large witt design @xmath14_. the steiner systems @xmath12 and @xmath14 are due to e.  witt ( 1938 ) and r.d .",
    "carmichel ( 1937 ) . for many decades",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath14 were the only known steiner systems with parameter @xmath15 . even today",
    "only finitely many steiner systems @xmath6 with @xmath16 and none with @xmath17 seem to be known @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another remarkable property of the two witt designs concerns their automorphism group . recall that a group @xmath18 of permutations acts ( sharply )",
    "@xmath3-transitively , if for two ordered @xmath3-tuples of elements there is a ( unique ) permutation in @xmath18 taking the first to the second @xmath3-tuple .",
    "the automorphism groups of the witt designs @xmath12 and @xmath14 act @xmath19-transitively on their sets of points ; for the small witt design the action is even sharply @xmath19-transitive .",
    "these automorphism groups are the _",
    "mathieu groups _ @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "they were discovered by e.  mathieu in 1861 and 1873 , and they are early examples of _ sporadic finite simple groups_. the only finite @xmath3-transitive permutation groups with @xmath16 other than symmetric and alternating groups that seem to be known are the two mathieu groups mentioned above and two of their subgroups ( the mathieu groups @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "so the witt designs are indeed remarkable combinatorial structures .",
    "the starting point of our construction of @xmath12 is the projective plane of order three with point set @xmath24 .",
    "it is a steiner system @xmath25 , but its blocks are called _",
    "lines_.    the first step is to discuss the @xmath26-sets of points in @xmath24 .",
    "they fall into four classes which can be described in various ways , but the crucial observation is that two @xmath26-sets are in the same class if and only if they have the same number of trisecants ( i.e.  lines meeting the set in exactly three points ) .",
    "next we choose one point of @xmath24 , say @xmath27 .",
    "the twelve points of @xmath28 will be the points of the witt design @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce three kinds of @xmath26-subsets of @xmath29 and call them blocks .",
    "each block together with the distinguished point @xmath27 has a complement in @xmath24 with exactly six elements .",
    "so properties of @xmath26-sets in @xmath24 carry over to properties of blocks .    finally , we show that @xmath29 , together with the set of all blocks , is a steiner system @xmath11 . again , the results on @xmath26-sets of points turn out useful when showing that any @xmath19-set @xmath30 is contained in a block , since @xmath31 is a @xmath26-set of points in the projective plane .    the proof presented in this paper",
    "is closely related to a projective representation , in the five - dimensional projective space of order three , of the small witt design due to h.s.m .",
    "coxeter @xcite ; see @xcite and the references given there .",
    "furthermore , we refer to @xcite for an alternative description of the present construction of @xmath12 using completely different methods .",
    "let @xmath24 be the set of points of the projective plane of order three or , in other words , the steiner system @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "there are exactly @xmath32 lines ( blocks ) through each point of @xmath24 .",
    "the unique line joining distinct points @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be written as @xmath35 .      1 .",
    "@xmath37 is the union of a line and two further points ( fig.[abb1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath37 is the symmetric difference of two different lines ( fig .",
    "[ abb2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath37 consists of a triangle and an inscribed triangle , i.e.  each point of the second triangle lies on exactly one line of the first triangle ( fig .",
    "[ abb3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath37 is the set of vertices of a quadrilateral , i.e.  the set of points where two distinct lines of the quadrilateral meet ( fig .",
    "[ abb4 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath37 is of type @xmath4 then each vertex of the `` basic '' triangle is on exactly two trisecants of @xmath37 , whereas each point of the `` inscribed '' triangle is on one trisecant only .",
    "so the role of the two triangles is not the same .",
    "since two distinct vertices of the inscribed triangle determine the remaining one uniquely , the number of @xmath26-sets of type @xmath4 is @xmath41      we observe that a @xmath26-set of type @xmath43 has exactly @xmath44 trisecants .",
    "so the four types of @xmath26-sets do not overlap .",
    "finally , from @xmath45 our list from above comprises all @xmath26-sets of points .      1 .",
    "@xmath47 is the symmetric difference of two distinct lines , each not incident with @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath48 is the union of two distinct lines .",
    "@xmath47 consists of a quadrangle together with two of its diagonal points ; moreover , @xmath27 is the remaining diagonal point .",
    "if a block @xmath47 is of type a , b , or c , then @xmath49 is easily seen to be a @xmath26-set of type @xmath38 , @xmath5 or @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "thus the blocks fall into classes a , b , and c. also , let us remark that the complement in @xmath29 of a block of type a , b , or c is a block of type b , a , or c , respectively .",
    "blocks of type b are of the form @xmath51 with lines @xmath52 and @xmath53 . counting the possibilities for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and taking into account whether @xmath27 is on both lines or",
    "not , shows that there are precisely @xmath56 blocks of type b.    we obtain all quadrangles with diagonal point @xmath27 by drawing two distinct lines , say @xmath54 and @xmath55 , through @xmath27 and choosing two distinct points on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "so the number of blocks of type c equals @xmath59                                  1 .",
    "suppose that @xmath37 consists of a line @xmath54 and two further points ; let @xmath55 be the line joining those points .",
    "then @xmath74 is a block of type b containing @xmath62 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath37 be the symmetric difference of distinct lines @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "then @xmath51 is a block of type b with the required property .",
    "3 .   let @xmath37 be the union of a triangle @xmath75 and an inscribed triangle @xmath76 such that @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "there are two subcases : + if @xmath80 , say @xmath67 , then put @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 and @xmath83 is a quadrangle with diagonal points @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 which gives rise to a block of type c containing @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ abb5 ] ) .",
    "+ if @xmath84 , say @xmath69 , then put @xmath85 . then @xmath86 .",
    "so the symmetric difference of @xmath35 and @xmath87 is a block of type a through @xmath62 ( fig .  [ abb6 ] ) .",
    "4 .   let @xmath88 be the set of vertices of a quadrangle . w.l.o.g .",
    "let @xmath89 .",
    "so @xmath90 is a quadrangle with diagonal points @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath68 , say .",
    "therefore @xmath91 is a block of type c ( fig .",
    "[ abb7 ] ) .",
    "\\(c ) given a @xmath19-set @xmath30 then denote by @xmath92 the number of blocks passing through it .",
    "since each of the @xmath60 blocks contains exactly @xmath26 subsets of @xmath29 with @xmath19 elements , we obtain from the principle of counting in two ways that @xmath93 from ( b ) , @xmath94 for each of the @xmath95 sets @xmath62 appearing in the sum above .",
    "so @xmath96 is constant .",
