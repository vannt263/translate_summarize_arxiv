    "in general , cognitive users are able to coexist with primary users in two ways .",

    "@xcite , @xcite . in osa",
    ", cognitive users are allowed to access the spectrum only if the spectrum is idle , and have to free the spectrum as soon as possible once the spectrum is re - occupied . in ss , cognitive users are allowed to access the spectrum even when the spectrum is occupied , provided that the co - channel interference inflicted to the _ primary receiver _ ( pr ) does not violate a maximum interference power constraint , namely , _",
    "interference temperature_. therefore , compared with osa , ss is able to exploit more spectrum opportunities and obtain higher spectrum utilization efficiency , both of which boost the cognitive throughput @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in recent years , ss has been studied extensively @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these literature , the interference temperature of the primary system is usually assumed to be known to the _ cognitive transmitter _ ( ct ) , such that the ct is able to explicitly control the transmit power and protect primary transmissions . however , to obtain the interference temperature , the ct needs a backhaul link from the primary system .",
    "then , the primary system can transmit the information of the interference temperature to the ct . in practice",
    ", there may not exist any backhaul link between the two systems .",
    "thus , it is challenging for the ct to obtain the interference temperature and achieve ss in such a situation .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the interference temperature is highly related to the channel gain between primary transceivers , namely , primary channel gain .",
    "specifically , within a _ quality of service _ ( qos ) guaranteed primary system , the _ primary transmitter",
    "_ ( pt ) automatically adapts its transmit power to satisfy a target _ signal to interference plus noise ratio _ ( sinr or snr ) at the pr or equivalently a target transmission rate .",
    "a large primary channel gain means that the target qos of a primary transmission can be easily satisfied , even when the transmit power of primary signals is small . under the maximum transmit power constraint at the pt ,",
    "the primary transmission is able to tolerate a strong interference signal meanwhile achieve the target qos by increasing the transmit power of primary signals .",
    "this leads to a large interference temperature and contributes to a high cognitive throughput . on the contrary , if the primary channel gain is small , a large transmit power of primary signals is required to satisfy the target qos .",
    "then , to achieve the target qos of the primary transmission , only a weak interference signal can be tolerated , even when the pt works with the maximum transmit power .",
    "this leads to a small interference temperature and reduces the cognitive throughput .",
    "therefore , the primary channel gain is very important in calculating the interference temperature .",
    "( the detailed mathematical calculation of the interference temperature with the primary channel gain can be found in appendix a. )    conventionally , the primary channel gain is estimated in the primary system .",
    "in particular , the pt transmits a training signal to the pr through the primary channel .",
    "the pr extracts the information of the primary channel gain from the received training signal , and calculates the interference temperature .",
    "but , the ct can not obtain the primary channel gain . to deal with this issue",
    ", we propose new methods for the ct to estimate the primary channel gain , such that the ct is able to calculate the interference temperature and achieve ss .",
    "we note that there exists an implicit relation between primary signals and the primary channel gain . as a consequence , it is possible for the ct to exploit the relation to estimate the primary channel gain . in principle , within a qos guaranteed primary system , primary signals are carefully designed based on the primary channel gain . in particular ,",
    "if the primary channel gain is strong , the pt is able to satisfy the target qos with a low transmit power . otherwise , the pt needs to increase its transmit power to compensate for the target qos . in other words ,",
    "primary signals contain some information of the primary channel gain .",
    "thus , it becomes possible for the ct to obtain the primary channel gain .    in this paper",
    ", we develop two estimators , i.e. , a high - complexity _ maximum likelihood _ ( ml ) estimator and a low - complexity _ median based _ ( mb ) estimator , for the ct to obtain the primary channel gain .",
    "numerical results show that the estimation errors of the ml estimator and the mb estimator can reach as small as @xmath0 db and @xmath1 db , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the ml estimator outperforms the mb estimator in terms of the estimation error if the snr of the received primary signals at the ct is no smaller than @xmath2 db .",
    "otherwise , the mb estimator is superior to the ml estimator from the aspect of both the computational complexity and the estimation accuracy .    to our best knowledge , this is the first work that considers unknown interference temperature at the ct and estimates the primary channel gain for ss .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    @xmath3 by enabling the ct to sense primary signals and adopting the ml criterion to analyze the received primary signals , we develop a ml estimator for the ct to obtain the primary channel gain . in particular , the ml estimator is obtained by solving a nonlinear equation . to shed more light on the estimator design , we study the property of the nonlinear equation and develop a bisection method to solve it .",
    "in addition , we analyze the computational complexity of the ml estimator .",
    "@xmath3 after demonstrating the high computational complexity of the ml estimator , we develop a mb estimator with proved low complexity . by denoting @xmath4 as the number of the received primary signals , we derive both lower and upper bounds of an estimation with a certain probability .",

    "fig . [ fig.1 ] provides the system model , which consists of a pt , a pr , and a ct .",
    "in particular , the pt is transmitting data to the pr on a wireless channel .",
    "meanwhile , the ct intends to estimate the primary channel gain between the pt and the pr for ss . in what follows",
    ", we will present the channel model and signal model in the considered system , respectively .",
    "block fading channels are considered among three users .",
    "specifically , if we denote @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) as the small - scale block fading and the large - scale channel gain coefficients between the pt and pr ( ct ) , the channel between the pt and pr ( ct ) is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "( @xmath12 ) remains constant within each block and varies independently among different blocks . on the other hand , @xmath14 ( @xmath12 )",
    "is determined by the path - loss model .",
    "if we adopt the path loss model @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( km ) is the distance between two transceivers , the large - scale channel gain @xmath14 is @xmath17 and remains constant all the time for a given distance @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the ct needs to estimate the primary channel gain @xmath7 from the pt to pr for ss .",
    "since we focus on the sensing phase for the ct to estimate the primary channel gain , we will not discuss the transmission phase in the rest of this paper .",
    "denote @xmath18 as the primary signal with unit power , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "if the pt transmits the primary signal with power @xmath20 , the received signal at the pr in block @xmath21 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the awgn at the pr with zero mean and variance @xmath24 .",
    "then , the snr of the received primary signal at the pr is @xmath25    we further consider that the pt and pr adopt _ close loop power control _ ( clpc ) to provide qos guaranteed wireless communication @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "that means , the pt automatically adjusts its transmit power to meet a certain target snr @xmath26 at the pr .",

    "in this section , we develop a ml estimator to obtain the primary channel gain @xmath7 between the pt and the pr . in",

    "otherwise , the pt increases its transmit power to compensate for the target qos .",
    "in other words , primary signals contain some information of the primary channel gain .",
    "thus , the ct can obtain the primary channel gain by sensing primary signals .    by sensing the received primary signals , the ct can obtain the snr of the received primary signal as shown in ( [ gamma_c_1 ] ) . from ( [ gamma_c_1 ] ) , each snr of the received primary signal at the ct is highly related to the primary channel gain @xmath7 .",
    "then , it is possible for the ct to measure the snr of the received primary signal and estimate @xmath7 .",

    "we note that the ml criterion is able to efficiently extract the common information from multiple data and performs well for parameter estimations @xcite .",
    "thus , we adopt the ml criterion and develop a ml estimator for the ct to obtain the primary channel gain @xmath7 between the pt and pr .      by removing the block index @xmath21 in ( [ gamma_c_1 ] ) and writing ( [ gamma_c_1 ] ) into the form of db",
