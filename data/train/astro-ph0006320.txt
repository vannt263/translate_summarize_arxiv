    "the nature of the dark matter dominating the mass of the galaxy remains elusive .",
    "although nonbaryonic forms of dark matter are one possible explanation , it is possible that much or most of the mass may be baryonic .",
    "recent results from gravitational microlensing experiments , such as macho and eros ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ; lasserre et al .",
    "2000 ) , have put severe constraints on the abundances of compact baryonic objects in the galaxy , - such as brown dwarfs , old white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black hole remnants - thus virtually removing stellar objects as candidates for being the major constituent of the dark matter ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ; freese , fields , & graff 2000 ; lasserre et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "it has recently been proposed that the dark matter in the galaxy could consist of small , cold clouds of h@xmath2 ( pfenniger , combes , & martinet 1994 ; de paolis et al .",
    "1995a , 1995b , 1996 ; gerhard & silk 1996 ) .",
    "walker & wardle ( 1998 ) pointed out that such clouds could be responsible for the extreme scattering events ( eses ; fiedler et al .",
    "1994 ) , which would occur when the line of sight to an extragalactic point radio source is crossed by the photoionized cloud envelope . in a later paper , wardle & walker ( 1999 )",
    "considered the thermal stability of such clouds and showed that these clouds could be stable against heating by cosmic rays .",
    "these clouds could have masses of the order of jupiter s mass ( @xmath3 ) and radii @xmath4 au . if they exist , these clouds could also naturally explain the core radii of galaxies ( walker 1999 ) as well as the @xmath5-ray emission from the galactic halo ( kalberla , shchekinov , & dettmar 1999 ; sciama 2000 ) .",
    "cloud - cloud collisions would steadily resupply the galactic disk with gas to sustain steady star formation .",
    "the proposed clouds are not compact enough to produce any gravitational microlensing ( henriksen & widrow 1995 ) but draine ( 1998 ) demonstrated that they can produce magnification of background stellar sources .",
    "refraction of light passing through the clouds would cause amplification of background stars in a way resembling gravitational microlensing , which provides us with the possibility of using searches for gravitational microlensing events to either detect such gas clouds or constrain the properties of the cloud population .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the lensing rate of the stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) by clouds of molecular hydrogen , taking into account the spatial distribution of the clouds and all the relevant motions which contribute to this rate : motion of the observer on the earth , proper motion of the lmc , the velocity distribution of stars in the cloud , and the velocity distribution of lensing clouds in the galactic halo .",
    "we suppose that the dark matter is composed of clouds of only one size and mass and that the clouds are transparent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ phys ] we review some aspects of the lensing by gaseous clouds . in  [ sec : rate ] we derive basic formulae for the rate of lensing events produced by the gaseous clouds and for timescale distribution of this sort of lensing . in  [ results ]",
    "we present our results in the form of parametric plots , covering a wide range of cloud models , and compare our results with those obtained by collaborations undertaking searches for gravitational microlensing events .",
    "we determine the region of parameter space which is not excluded by these experiments and other constraints . finally , in ",
    "[ disc ] we compare our results with the limits placed on cloud models by other authors from different arguments .",
    "the physics of lensing by gaseous clouds has been discussed by draine ( 1998 ) and we repeat here only the salient points . the refractive index @xmath6 is related to the gas density @xmath7 by @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 for h@xmath2/he gas with 24% he by mass ( aip handbook 1972 ) .    for small deflections , a light ray with impact parameter @xmath11 will be deflected through an angle @xmath12    let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be the distance from source to lens , and from observer to lens ( see figure [ picture ] ) .",
    "if @xmath15 is the distance of the lens center from the straight line from source to observer , then the apparent distance @xmath11 of the image from the lens is given by the lensing equation @xmath16      following draine ( 1998 ) we define a dimensionless `` strength '' parameter @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the cloud mass , radius , and mean density .    as the pressure density - relation in such clouds is uncertain , draine ( 1998 ) considered polytropic equations of state for polytropic index @xmath31 .",

    ", we can obtain a simple analytical formula describing the dependence of the central magnification @xmath41 upon the strength parameter @xmath42 . if we define dimensionless variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 , it is straightforward to show that as @xmath45 @xmath46 the integral in this expression depends only on the cloud density profile .    substituting this result into ( [ eq : mag ] ) we get @xmath47 where @xmath48",

    "when a cloud crosses the line of sight between the distant star and the observer on the earth , it amplifies or attenuates the brightness of the star [ in fact each gaseous lensing curve exhibits some demagnification before and after the peak magnification ( draine 1998 ) , but we will be primarily interested in amplification in this paper ] .",
    "this effect can be observed by searches for gravitational microlensing in our galaxy which monitor the brightness of a large number of stars .",

    "it is important to distinguish events with different durations .",
    "any real gravitational microlensing experiment has some finite probability @xmath84 of detecting a lensing event which occurred during the monitoring campaign and this detection efficiency function @xmath85 depends strongly upon the timescale of the observed event ( alcock 1997 ) .",
    "we define the timescale @xmath86 of the lensing event as the time which the light curve spends above a threshold magnification @xmath71 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the angular impact parameter of the lens s trajectory relative to the source star ; @xmath89 ( otherwise @xmath90 ) .    in calculations of the rate of lensing we must take into account the fact that lensing clouds and source stars have some distribution in velocity space ; we average the lensing rate over these distributions to obtain the true expected rate .",
    "the general formula for the event rate per lensing cloud is @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the velocity distribution functions for lensing clouds and source stars , respectively , @xmath94 is the number of source stars per unit solid angle on the sky , and @xmath95 is the detection efficiency function for a lensing event with timescale @xmath86 .",
    "we assume for simplicity isotropic maxwellian distribution functions for the velocities of both lenses and source stars with dispersions @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively , taking into account the fact that the object containing stars is moving in general , i.e. there is some offset velocity @xmath98 in the latter distribution : @xmath99 and @xmath100 our calculations are not very sensitive to this assumption in the sense that the order of magnitude result does not depend strongly upon the exact shape of the velocity distribution .",
    "the important assumption of isotropy of the distribution function permits analytical simplifications .",

    "for example , it is directly applicable to the case of gravitational microlensing [ with corresponding @xmath114 , in which case it is identical to the formula for the event rate obtained by griest ( 1991 ) .",
    "it is interesting to know the timescale distribution of the event rate to have some idea of where to look for the events produced by the gaseous lensing .",
    "the timescale distribution is given by ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) @xmath115 where @xmath116 is defined in ( [ b_0 ] ) and @xmath117 , entering the definitions of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 in ( [ constants ] ) , is given by @xmath121 [ compare with a similar formula by griest ( 1991 ) for the case of gravitational microlensing ] .    closely related to the timescale distribution @xmath122 is its integral from @xmath123 to infinity , that is the frequency of events with timescales exceeding @xmath123 , @xmath124 where function @xmath125 is now @xmath126    if one wants to know the true event rate , for @xmath127 efficiency , one need only set @xmath128 in formulae ( [ dist ] ) and ( [ rate - t_min ] ) , as we will do in our consideration of the event rate distributions .",

    "we adopted a simple approach for the caustic regime .",
    "one can see from figure [ lightcurve ] ( upper panel ) that for a given polytropic index there exists a specific value of @xmath229 such that the inner minimum of the lightcurve ( between the central part and one of the caustic spikes ) has magnification @xmath71 .",

    "that is we assume for @xmath233 that @xmath228 only in the central part of the lightcurve .",

    ", we see that the allowed region is quite substantial , and contains the model with @xmath267 and @xmath268 au which was favored by draine ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is also possible to expand the allowed region by assuming that the clouds contribute only a small part @xmath269 of the dark matter ( see  [ param ] ) , but to get any significant effect we need to suppose that this fraction is @xmath270 which would rule out these clouds as a main constituent of the dark matter , and eliminate them as the explanation for the extreme scattering events .",
    "it is clear that our lensing restriction represented on figure [ par_space ] is sensitive to the adopted density profile of an individual cloud , but it is relatively insensitive to changes in the spatial and velocity distributions of the dark matter , since changes in these parameters are unlikely to produce variations in the event rate of @xmath271 orders of magnitude , which would be needed to move the restriction given by the observed lensing rate significantly away from the line `` rate @xmath251 '' .",
    "wardle & walker ( 1999 ) suggested that heating caused by cosmic rays in the cold molecular clouds can be balanced if particles of solid h@xmath2 can form .",
    "they argue that these particles cool the cloud by thermal continuum radiation if the cloud mass lies in the range @xmath272 .",
    "our calculations show that the lensing event rate would grow to extremely high values for masses below @xmath273 ( see figures [ n_1_5_macho ] and [ n_4_5_macho ] ) .",
    "kalberla , shchekinov , & dettmar ( 1999 ) proposed that the @xmath5-ray background emission from the galactic halo seen in egret ( @xmath274 mev photons ) data can be produced by interaction of high - energy cosmic rays with small dense clouds .",
    "they modeled this effect with different types of spatial distribution of dark matter in the form of these clouds and found that their best fit to the egret data for uniform density clouds occurred for @xmath275 .",
    "their conclusions about the cloud parameters are model dependent , but the quoted values fall within the allowed range on figure [ par_space ] for @xmath32 .    though it is impossible to observe the gravitational microlensing by the molecular clouds in our galaxy it becomes possible if one observes them in other galaxies .",
    "a search for such lenses in the virgo cluster is now underway ( tadros , warren , & hewett 2000 ) and preliminary results indicate that galaxy halos are unlikely to primarily consist of object with masses smaller than @xmath276 .",
    "we confirm this restriction but also place more rigorous constraints on the cloud properties since we can reject many models with higher cloud masses .",
    "another possible approach would be to look for periods of demagnification in the light curves of lensing events .",
    "for instance , the ogle - ii survey ( udalski et al . 1997 ) has collected a large sample of light curves for stars in the galactic bulge , including @xmath277 lensing events ( woniak 2000 ) . of these ,",
    "two or three appear to show demagnification preceding or following the central peak in brightness , although the statistical significance of the demagnification has not yet been established ( woniak , private communication ) .",
    "demagnification can not be produced by gravitational lensing by one or more point masses , but would be a characteristic signature of gaseous lensing .",
    "in this paper we have considered in detail the lensing of stars in the lmc by small self - gravitating molecular clouds which have been proposed as a candidate for the dark matter in the galaxy . lensing would occur because of the refraction of optical light in the clouds , with resulting magnification of the source .",
    "we have developed a semianalytical formalism for calculation of the lensing rate including the spatial distribution of the dark matter , finite velocity dispersions of the lensing clouds and the source stars in lmc , and proper motion of the observer and lmc itself .",
    "our calculations were carried out for a single mass and size cloud population .",
    "one can easily extend the analysis to a distribution of cloud masses and sizes by simply convolving event rates obtained for a uniform cloud population with the appropriate distributions .",
    "lensing events might be detectable by searches for gravitational microlensing .",
    "this has allowed us to obtain constraints on the cloud properties by comparing our calculations with observational results obtained by the macho collaboration .",
    "we found that almost the only possibility for the dark matter to be in the form of such molecular clouds is for the clouds to be sufficiently weak lenses so that their lensing effects are below the detection threshold of the macho experiment , since otherwise a very large gaseous lensing event rate would have been detected .",
    "this still leaves an allowed region in parameter space where these clouds could exist and not contradict the limitations posed by lensing experiments and simple physical considerations .    though we have performed event rate calculations for only one halo model [ given by equation ( [ halo ] ) ] , we expect our results to be relatively insensitive to the particular form of the spatial distribution of these clouds , or the assumed shape of the velocity distribution of the clouds and the stars in the lmc .",
    "future microlensing experiments with a lower detection threshold magnification @xmath71 could either detect these clouds or strengthen the constraints on their properties .",
    "we thank b.paczyski and p.woniak for very helpful discussions , and r.h.lupton for availability of the sm plotting package .",
    "this research has been supported in part by nsf grants ast-9619429 and ast-9988126 .",
    "for the purposes of the lensing rate calculations the velocities of the lens , observer , and source along the line of sight are not important , because only transverse motions are significant .",
    "it means that we can immediately perform integrations in equation ( [ rate - raw ] ) over @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "taking into account ( [ timescale ] ) we can perform integration over @xmath88 in ( [ rate - raw ] ) and define the result as a function @xmath280 : @xmath281 so that now @xmath282 we now change variables from @xmath283 and @xmath284 to @xmath285 and @xmath286 via equation ( [ vels ] ) : @xmath287    we integrate over @xmath288 and @xmath289 to obtain after lengthy but straightforward calculations @xmath290 where @xmath291 @xmath292    introducing polar coordinates in velocity space @xmath293 , @xmath294 and normalizing @xmath295 to some characteristic velocity @xmath117 we get @xmath296 where @xmath297 the last integral in equation ( [ rate-3 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath298 where @xmath106 is the modified bessel function of order zero , and @xmath299    so , finally we get for the event rate produced by one lens @xmath300    thus , the total event rate per source , produced by all lenses between us and lmc , is given by formula ( [ rate - tot ] ) .",
    "now , we obtain the formula for the timescale distribution ( [ dist ] ) . note that @xmath86 and @xmath88  the angular distance from the lens s trajectory to the source star in the perpendicular direction  are directly related by equation ( [ timescale ] ) : @xmath301 with @xmath302 , @xmath303 . to obtain @xmath122",
    "we simply omit the integration over @xmath88 in ( [ rate - raw ] ) . also , the velocity @xmath304 is limited by @xmath305 .",
    "all the other steps are analogous to those which we have done in derivation of ( [ rate - tot ] ) and we obtain equation ( [ dist ] ) .    if we are interested only in events whose durations are larger than some chosen value @xmath123 , then to get the total rate we should integrate in ( [ rate - raw ] ) over @xmath88 not up to @xmath306 , but up to @xmath307 with @xmath308 .",
    "one can easily see that we will get in this case for @xmath129 the formula ( [ rate - t_min ] ) .",
    "the detection efficiency function @xmath85 characterizes the sensitivity of the experiment to events with different durations .",
    "we will use the detection efficiency @xmath309 assumed by macho experiment to estimate how it would affect gaseous lensing ( see figure 8 in alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) .",
    "we first recall some simple facts about gravitational microlensing .",
    "the amplification @xmath216 in the case of gravitational microlensing is determined by the formula @xmath310^{1/2 } , \\label{gml}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath311 is the impact parameter , @xmath6 is the mass of the lensing object , @xmath312 is the time of observation , and @xmath304 is , again , the relative velocity of the lens and the source star .",
    "recall that we defined the timescale @xmath86 to be the time spent with magnification @xmath72 . from equation ( [ gml ] ) we find that , for gravitational microlensing , @xmath313^{1/2}\\nonumber    \\\\= \\hat t\\left[u_t^2-u_{min}^2 \\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{tau - b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath314 is the value of @xmath315 at which the magnification is equal to @xmath71 and @xmath316 is the maximum magnification for a given @xmath317 .",
    "we use a very simple algorithm for converting detection efficiency function from @xmath318 to @xmath86 : since @xmath319 , their ratio @xmath320 is a function of @xmath316 ( or @xmath317 ) for a given @xmath71 .",
    "thus we can average this ratio over the distribution of the maximum magnifications @xmath316 and assume that the value of known @xmath321 is equal to the @xmath322 , that is @xmath323    the calculation of @xmath324 is quite straightforward and can be most easily done in terms of @xmath317 ( see the last equality in equation ( [ tau - b ] ) ) . since the distribution of lensing events over @xmath317 is just constant @xmath325^{1/2}du_{min}}{\\int\\limits^{u_t}_0 du_{min}}= \\frac{\\pi}{4}u_t=\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2 } } \\left(\\frac{a_t}{\\sqrt{a_t^2 - 1}}-1\\right)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] for @xmath140 , accepted by macho experiment , @xmath326 , which means that @xmath327 ."
