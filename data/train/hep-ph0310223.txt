    "most recent studies of photoproduction have been done with fixed target , real photon beams , or in @xmath7 collisions at the hera collider , where the electromagnetic field of the electron is a source of photons .",
    "however , collisions at hera are limited to photon - proton center of mass energies of about 200 gev , and no higher energy photoproduction facilities are planned .",
    "however , photoproduction can also be studied at @xmath3 and @xmath8 colliders .",
    "these collisions offer some advantages over @xmath7 collisions .",
    "the fermilab tevatron can reach somewhat higher @xmath9 energies than hera , and the lhc can reach more than an order of magnitude higher in energy than hera . although photoproduction is a smaller fraction of the total cross section at @xmath3 colliders than at hera , higher machine luminosities can at least partly make up for this .",
    "finally , the cp antisymmetric @xmath3 and cp symmetric @xmath10 initial states allow for some interesting interference effects .",
    "similar reactions are already studied at heavy ion colliders @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration at rhic has measured the cross section for @xmath11 @xcite , and a significant photonuclear and two - photon physics program is planned for the lhc @xcite .",
    "cross sections for @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite have been calculated .",
    "photonuclear interactions with heavy ions are limited to lower energies than for proton collisions .    here , we consider photoproduction of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at rhic , the tevatron , and the lhc .",
    "although it runs at a somewhat lower energy than the tevatron , rhic collides polarized protons , allowing for photoproduction studies with polarized targets .    after introducing the ideas behind photoproduction , we will show the rates , rapidity distributions and @xmath2 spectra for these cases .",
    "we will also note how this reaction can be used to measure gluon parton distributions down to @xmath12 at the tevatron and @xmath13 at the lhc . after discussing the production rates",
    ", we will briefly discuss the experimental feasibility of the measurement .",
    "although we focus on vector meson production , other photoproduction reactions should also be accessible at proton colliders .",
    "@xmath5 photoproduction in @xmath3 collisions has been considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "that calculation used a very different approach , focusing on the energy lost by the protons .",
    "this makes analytic or numerical comparisons between their result and ours very difficult .",
    "photoproduction rates depend on two factors : the photon flux , and the photon - proton cross section .",
    "the cross section is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the photon energy , @xmath16 is the photon flux , and @xmath17 is the corresponding photoproduction cross section . the 2 accounts for the fact that either proton / anti - proton can be the emitter or the target .",
    "the photon flux is given by the weizscker - williams method of virtual photons .",
    "for high energy photons , there is a need to consider the proton internal structure .",
    "we use the photon spectrum given by drees and zeppenfield @xcite @xmath18\\ ! \\big(\\ln{a } - { 11\\over 6 } + { 3\\over a } -{3\\over{2 a^2 } } + { 1\\over 3a^3}\\big)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the fine structure constant and @xmath20 equation 2 is derived using a proton form factor with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the lorentz boost of the beam and @xmath23 is the proton - proton center of mass energy .",
    "this spectrum is close to that of a point charge with a minimum 0.7 fm impact parameter .    for exclusive vector meson production ,",
    "the photoproduction reaction must not be accompanied by hadronic interactions . to explore this",
    ", we consider an alternative photon flux .",
    "we eliminate the proton form factor , treating the proton as a point charge , and instead require @xmath24 fm .",
    "this reduces the vector meson production by about 20% ; half the difference between these calculations is a reasonable estimate of the systematic uncertainty . a more detailed calculation , including the hadronic interaction probability as a function of @xmath25 , should lead to a more accurate photon flux , with smaller errors .",
    "the photon flux in @xmath3 and @xmath26 collisions can also be studied by considering other photoproduction and two - photon interactions .",
    "the photoproduction cross sections , @xmath27 depend on the gluon density in the proton@xcite . at mid - rapidity , @xmath5 production is sensitive to gluon with @xmath28 down to @xmath29 at the tevatrony and @xmath30 at the lhc .",
    "away from mid - rapidity , significantly lower gluon energies can be probed .    for cross section estimates , we use data from hera .",
    "of course , this requires some extrapolation at the tevatron , and significant extrapolation at the lhc , but that s why the measurement is interesting .",
    "we parameterize the @xmath5 cross section@xcite @xmath31 where w is the @xmath32 center of mass energy . up to @xmath33 gev , this is well measured .",
    "the @xmath34 cross section is parameterized@xcite @xmath35 neither the absolute values of the cross section nor the energy dependence are well known , so there is considerable room for an improved measurement .",
    "the ratio of @xmath34 to @xmath36 to @xmath37 is also unknown ; the zeus and h1 collaborations assumed that about 70% of the signal was from @xmath38 .",
    "this ratio seems to be measurable at the tevatron .",
    "the photon energy can be determined from the rapidity of the produced vector meson , @xmath39 : @xmath40 one complication is that either beam particle is equally likely to produce the photon ; the cross sections for these two possibilities are added . unambiguous determination of the photon energy is possible only at @xmath41 ; more sophisticated analyses are needed to determine the cross section for other photon energies .",
    "two promising approaches to moving away from @xmath41 are to use lower energy data to determine the cross section for the lower energy photon , and to measure the ratio from the two directions by measuring the interference fraction , as discussed below",
    ". it may also be possible to use roman pots or other forward taggers to track the scattered protons ; the proton with the larger @xmath2 is very probably the target .",
    "this approach could at least partially resolve the two - fold direction ambiguity , and simplify gluon distribution measurements away from @xmath41 .    here",
    ", we consider 3 facilities : @xmath3 collisions at @xmath42 gev at rhic , @xmath43 collisions at 1.96 tev at the tevatron ( the results shown at the small - x and diffraction 2003 were at @xmath44 tev ) , and @xmath3 collisions at 14 tev at the lhc .",
    "we assume luminosities of @xmath45/@xmath46/s , @xmath47/@xmath46/s and @xmath48/@xmath46/s respectively . with these assumptions , we find the @xmath49 shown in fig .",
    "1 . table 1 summarizes the total cross sections and rates for @xmath5 and @xmath6 production .",
    "lighter vector mesons are also produced prolifically at @xmath3 and @xmath4 colliders .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 production should be several orders of magnitude larger than for the @xmath5 .",
    ".total cross sections and rates for production of the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 .",
    "the rates are for @xmath53 s of running at the tevatron and the lhc . for rhic , where most of the running time is devoted to heavy ions , @xmath54 s is used .",

    "the vector meson @xmath2 depends on the @xmath2 of the photon and the @xmath2 acquired when the vector meson is produced ; the latter is dominant in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "the @xmath2 of the photon depends on the form factor of the proton / anti - proton : @xmath55 where the form factor @xmath56 is the same one used previously . here , @xmath57 is the transverse momentum of the photon .",
    "the @xmath2 from the vector meson production is just given by the form factor .",
    "we assume that the photon @xmath2 and that obtained in the scattering are randomly oriented .",
    "the final ingredient in the @xmath2 spectrum is an interference term @xcite .",
    "the two possibilities , proton # 1 emitting a photon which scatters off proton # 2 , and vice versa , are indistinguishable , and so the amplitudes add .",
    "the cross section for a given impact parameter , @xmath25 , is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the amplitudes for production for the two possibilities .",
    "the exponential is a propagator to account for the phase difference between the two positions . at @xmath41 , @xmath61 and",
    "the cross section simplifies to @xmath62\\ ] ] the sign of the interference term depends on the symmetry of the system . for @xmath3 ( and @xmath63 ) colliders , one possibility can be transformed into the other via a parity transformation .",
    "vector mesons are @xmath64 , _",
    "i.e. _ negative parity , so the minus sign applies . for @xmath43 colliders ,",
    "the requisite transformation is a cp transform , so the plus sign applies .",
    "of course , the impact parameter @xmath25 is unmeasurable , so the @xmath2 spectrum is obtained by integrating over @xmath25 .",
    "this washes out the interference except for @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mean impact parameter .",
    "however , for @xmath3 collisions , the mean @xmath2 is not too different from @xmath67 , so the interference has a large effect on the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath2 distributions for @xmath6 production at rhic and the lhc .",
    "because of the different sign of the interference , they look quite different .",
    "as table 1 shows , the @xmath5 rates are high at all 3 accelerators . even after accounting for leptonic branching ratios and reasonable acceptance estimates",
    ", the signals should be large .",
    "the @xmath6 rates are high at the tevatron and the lhc , but , because of the small leptonic branching ratios , are marginal at rhic .    at rhic and the tevatron ,",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 photoproduction cross sections are both about 0.1% of the corresponding hadroproduction cross sections @xcite . however , because photoproduction is exclusive , @xmath68 , it should not be difficult to separate the signal from hadronic backgrounds .",
    "three characteristics appear useful in separating the signal : the meson @xmath2 , the presence of rapidity gaps , and the detection of the scattered protons . here , we focus on the @xmath6 .    hadronically produced vector mesons typically have @xmath69 .",
    "a cut on @xmath70 gev / c eliminates 94% of the hadronic background , while leaving almost all of the photoproduction .",
    "isolation cuts based on rapidity gaps can provide the remaining separation power . in a hadronic interaction ,",
    "the probability of having a rapidity gap with with @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mean charged particle multiplicity . at rhic , @xmath74 at @xmath41 , rising to 3.9 at the tevatron .",
    "so , a single gap with width @xmath75 will reduce the background by a factor of @xmath76 at rhic and @xmath77 at the tevatron , _ i.e. _ well below the signal level .",
    "this is well within the capability of large detectors .",
    "in fact , the situation is better than this , since there will be gaps on both sides of the vector meson .",
    "exclusive @xmath5 production has been seen by the cdf collaboration in @xmath4 collisions at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "we believe that the origin of these exclusive events is photoproduction in peripheral collisions , as described above .",
    "if they were needed , roman pots could be used to detect the scattered protons , gaining cleanliness at some cost in detection efficiency .",
    "one attractive feature of using roman pots is that if the proton @xmath2 can be measured , it should provide some information on which proton emitted the photon , and which was the scattering target .",
    "cuts on rapidity gaps are less effective in rejecting other diffractive interactions",
    ". however , vector mesons have the wrong quantum numbers to be produced in double - pomeron interactions .",
    "one background is double - pomeron production of the @xmath78 or @xmath79 , decaying to @xmath80 or @xmath81 , where the photon is missed . at the tevatron ,",
    "the double - pomeron cross sections for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 are about 600 - 735 nb and 0.1 - 0.9 nb respectively@xcite . after accounting for the branching ratio ,",
    "these backgrounds are small for the @xmath5 , and very probably small for the @xmath6 . also , the @xmath2 for double - pomeron produced mesons is considerably larger than for photoproduction .",
    "the photoproduction cross section rises with beam energy much more rapidly than the soft pomeron trajectory , so the ratio of photoproduction to hadronic interactions , both diffractive and non - diffractive , should grow as the beam energy increases .",
    "this is why photoproduction could not be observed in lower energy , fixed target , experiments .",
    "conversely , it should be even more important at the lhc .",
    "the rates for photoproduction of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons in @xmath3 and @xmath82 collisions at rhic , the tevatron and the lhc are high , and these reactions can be used to measure the gluon content of the proton at low @xmath28 values .",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum of the produced vector mesons are quite different at @xmath3 and @xmath82 colliders .",
    "the hadronic backgrounds to these reactions can be controlled by selecting events with low @xmath2 vector mesons in an otherwise empty detector .",
    "photoproduction of other channels may also be of interest at hadron colliders .",
    "the cross sections for different photoproduction channels rise rapidly with beam energy , in contrast to most diffractive channels .",
    "so , as accelerator energy progresses , photoproduction will become more and more important .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge useful conversations with angela wyatt and mike albrow .",
    "we thank the mike albrow , christophe royon and maxine hronek for organizing an enjoyable conference .",
