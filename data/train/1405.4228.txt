( for non - causality - based explanations for query answers in dl ontologies , see @xcite . )    since some causes may be stronger than others , @xcite also introduces and investigates _ responsibility _ , that reflects the relative degree of actual causality . in applications involving large data sets , it is crucial to rank potential causes according to their responsibilities @xcite .",

    "the notion of necessary hypothesis set we just introduced extends the notion of ( single ) necessary hypothesis that has been studied in abduction @xcite .",
    "the extended notion not only captures responsibility as defined in @xcite for datalog queries , but it is also interesting in the context of abduction _ per se_. in particular , it provides a sort of quantitative metric to rank relevant hypothesis according to their _ degree of necessity _ , which can be captured in terms of the sizes of necessary hypothesis sets to which they belong . in particular , the smaller the size of a necessary hypothesis set , the the more necessary are its elements to be included among the relevant hypothesis that explain the observation .",
    "we believe that the degree of necessity in abduction captures the notion of responsibility as introduced in the context of causality @xcite .",

    "it is easy to verify that the relevant hypothesis are the actual causes for @xmath106 .",

    "now they can be extended by applying results and techniques for abductive reasoning , as those obtained in @xcite .",
    "these extensions are a matter of ongoing research .",
    "another direction to explore for fruitful connections with all the above turns around the _ view update problem _ , which is about updating a database through views .",
    "the problem is about minimally changing the underlying database ( i.e. the base relations ) , in such a way that the changed base instance produces the intended changes in the view contents . put in other terms , it is an update propagation problem , from views to base relations .",
    "this old and important problem in databases .    since intended changes on the views may create alternative , admissible candidates to be the updated underlying database . as a consequence ,",
    "user knowledge imposed through view updates creates or reflects _ uncertainty _ about the base data .",
    "the view update problem is related to all the problems mentioned above .",
    "we mention some connections without going into details .",
    "first of all , the view update problem has been treated from the point of view of abductive reasoning @xcite .",
    "the idea is to  abduce \" changes on base tables that explain the intended changes on the views .",
    "we also should mention that database repairs are related to the view update problem . actually , _ answer set programs _ ( asps ) for database repairs ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive account and references ) implicity repair the database by updating conjunctive combinations of intentional , annotated predicates . those logical combinations -views after all- capture violations of integrity constraints in the original database or along the ( implicitly iterative ) repair process ( hence the need for annotations ) .",
    "even more , in @xcite , in order to protect sensitive information , databases are explicitly and virtually  repaired \" through secrecy views that specify the information that has to be kept secret . in order to protect information ,",
    "a user is allowed to interact only with the virtually repaired versions of the original database that result from making those views empty or contain only null values .",
    "repairs are specified and computed using asp , and an explicit connection to prioritized attribute - based repairs @xcite is made @xcite .",
    "finally , we should note that abduction has also been explicitly applied to database repairs @xcite .",
    "the idea , again , is to  abduce \" possible repair updates that bring the database to a consistent state .    the areas of causality for query answers , database repairs and consistent query answering , model - based diagnosis ( in its consistency - based and abductive versions ) , and database updates through views will all benefit from a deeper investigations of their mutual relationships , for better understanding them , and taking advantage of known results for some of them to obtain new results for the others .",
