    "in the relatively new scientific field of quantum information and quantum computing @xcite , the creation and control of entangled - photon pair is a rather key issue @xcite .",
    "the most used ( common ) way of generating entangled - photon pairs is through a parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique for entangled - photon generation is the two - photon cascade decay of atomic excitations @xcite .",
    "recently , an extension of the atomic technique , the cascade - emission process from a biexciton state in a semiconductor quantum dot ( sqd , usually called artificial atoms ) , was proposed @xcite and demonstrated @xcite . in this more efficient entangled - photon generation scheme , the entangled photons are generated from the cascade emission through the degenerate intermediate states having different polarizations .",
    "a much better control of this process is achieved by placing the sqd in a microcavity , where the material excitations and the photons of the cavity are strongly coupled . then the sqd - cavity system is described in terms of the coupled states of material excitations and cavity photons , which usually called dressed states ( properly treated using cavity quantum electrodynamics , i.e. describing matter and light on quantum mechanical grounds ) .",
    "actually , it has been shown in recent theoretical investigations that under specific optimal conditions a drastic enhancement of the entangled - photon generation can be achieved for sqds embedded in a cavity @xcite .",
    "this is achieved , as the dressed - states formed in the sqd - cavity system eliminate the which - path information which prevents the formation of entangled - photon pair in the biexciton decay process .",
    "moreover , the energies of these intermediate dressed states are tuned to be degenerate states by using a high - q cavity @xcite .",
    "recently the entangled - photon generation from a sqd - cavity system , where the biexciton is efficiently excited under resonant conditions , was studied in refs .",
    "the resonant excitations of biexciton occur through the dressed biexciton states .",
    "two of the four bell states can be generating by selecting the frequencies of applied fields with certain polarizations ( cross - circularly polarized fields ) @xcite .",
    "the other two bell states can be generated by changing the combination of polarizations or by properly adjusting only the frequencies of the input fields@xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have achieved control of the non - entangled co - polarized photons @xcite , as they are strongly suppressed due to the photon blockade effect @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate theoretically the entangled - photon generation from an sqd - cavity system by calculating the thermal entanglement of formation ( eof ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our model of the qd - cavity system and the resulting dressed states .",
    "the bell states generated from the dressed states are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we present numerical results on the entangled - photon pairs from the qd - cavity system in the presence of a biexciton .",
    "our results are summarized in sec.v .",
    "we describe the qd nanostructure by a four - level system taking into account the ground state @xmath0 , the two circularly right and left polarized degenerate exciton states @xmath1 and the biexciton state @xmath2 , which are orthogonal and normalized .",
    "in addition we consider that the qd is embedded in a microcavity which supports circularly right- and left- polarized photons of energy equal to the energy difference between the exciton and the ground state .",
    "actually , we should be careful if we have to include other ( excited ) exciton states and biexciton states .",
    "the present model is valid once the level separation of excitons and biexcitons are greater than the vacuum rabi splitting .",
    "these approximations are valid in the gaas sqds as for realistic values of the later dimensions of the sqd the rabi splitting is of the order of few tenths of mev , while the level separation is a few mev @xcite .",
    "then , the qd - cavity system is represented by a hilbert space which is the direct product of states of the qd nanostructure and the cavity - mode photons .",
    "hence the representation of the product states has the following form , @xmath3 where y describes the energy states of the qd and @xmath4 specifies the number of the right- ( left- ) polarized photons in the cavity . in fact the presence of an anisotropic electron - hole exchange interaction results in the well known fine structure splitting ( fss ) of the two excitonic states . however in our study",
    "we assume that the two exciton states are degenerate , assuming that the fss has been minimized by either properly treating the qd structural properties , as for example by controlling the growth process , or by applying external ( mechanical , electric and magnetic ) fields .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the qd - cavity quantum system is given by @xmath5 where the index @xmath6 runs over the @xmath7 ( right- polarized ) and @xmath8 ( left - polarized ) qd states or cavity - mode photons .",
    "@xmath9 is the energy difference between the exciton and the ground state .",
    "@xmath10(@xmath11 ) is the coupling constants between the exciton(biexciton ) transition and one cavity - mode photon .",
    "@xmath12 is the binding energy of the biexciton state .",
    "the ground state has zero energy . in this article",
    "we adopt the natural units ( @xmath13=1 ) .",
    "it is rather straightforward to diagonalize the @xmath14 hamiltonian and find its eigenstates , usually called dressed states .",
    "these dressed states being a linear superposition of product states are characterized and grouped by the total number of qd excitations and photons .",
    "the product states are divided into one state of zero energy ( @xmath15 ) , four states of @xmath9 energy ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , seven states of @xmath20 energy ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and one state of @xmath28 energy ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the dressed states are categorized into three groups .",
    "the group with the lowest ( zero ) energy which is actually the @xmath15 product state .",
    "the second group with states of higher energy , all in the region of @xmath9 .",
    "actually we have only two energy values with a @xmath30 energy splitting known as the vacuum rabi splitting .",
    "these dressed states are a superposition of singly excited qd of specific polarization and absence of photons and ground state qd in the presence of one photon with the same polarization and hence can be characterized by their polarization ( namely , ( @xmath31,@xmath32,@xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) . finally , we have eight dressed states of energy around 2@xmath9 .",
    "we can separate these states into two categories , the co - polarized dressed states ( linear superposition of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath27 ) denoted as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and the cross - polarized dressed states ( linear superposition of @xmath39 , @xmath29 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) corresponding to a singlet state @xmath40 of energy @xmath20 and three triplet states . additionally , the cross - polarized states have eigen - energies of the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "substantially , @xmath43 are the differences of @xmath20 from each @xmath44 and they are the real solutions , multiplied by @xmath12 , of the equation @xcite , @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    in general the cavity is coupled to the environment by cavity - mode photons leaking out of the cavity . in order to have a control of these leaking photons we apply external electromagnetic fields interacting with the microcavity .",
    "we consider cw laser fields with electric fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 are the amplitudes and the frequencies of the right-(left- ) polarized laser fields all assumed real .",
    "then the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the lasers and the cavity photons is @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a phenomenological parameter describing the cavity photon leakage .",
    "the dynamics of the density matrix operator of the whole quantum system ( @xmath54 ) in which the damping of the excited states is taken into account is described by means of the following standard master equation @xmath55\\\\ & + \\gamma_x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\{|g\\rangle,|x_r\\rangle\\}_{\\rho(t ) } + \\frac{1}{2}\\{|g\\rangle,|x_l\\rangle\\}_{\\rho(t)}\\right ) \\\\ & + \\gamma_b\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\{|x_r\\rangle,|b\\rangle\\}_{\\rho(t ) } + \\frac{1}{2}\\{|x_l\\rangle,|b\\rangle\\}_{\\rho(t)}\\right ) \\\\ & + \\gamma",
    "\\{\\mathbbm{1},\\alpha_k^{\\dagger}\\}_{\\rho(t ) } \\end{split } \\label{master}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the damping constants from the exciton and biexciton , respectively .",
    "the last term of eq.([master ] ) represents the photon leakage from the cavity to the environment .",
    "we focus on the steady state solution of the master equation achieved , at sufficiently large @xmath59 , by vanishing the time derivative , of the coupled non - linear differential equations of the master equation and practically solving an algebraic system of non - linear equations .",
    "we work in the weak coupling regime assuming all the coupling constants much smaller than the characteristic energy , @xmath9 of the system under investigation .",
    "moreover , we consider the weak fields limit of very small amplitudes of both the external electric fields .",
    "both conditions should be met as under these conditions eq.([master ] ) is a valid master equation .",
    "now , we turn our attention to the emitted photon of the qd - cavity system .",
    "as we are in the weak field limit , it is sufficient to consider only the subspaces of zero , one and two excitations of qd and cavity simultaneously . actually it is more convenient to work with the dressed states of the qd - cavity system and assume only cascade transitions between neighboring subspaces .",
    "hence the corresponding transitions and emissions of a k - polarized photons are represented by the following operators @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the transition amplitude from the @xmath62 to the @xmath63 ( @xmath61 are summarized in ref.@xcite , from eq.(15 ) till eq.(19 ) ) .",
    "as the energy splitting of the dressed states in the two upper subsets is unequal we can take advantage of this and create entangled photons .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "we use input field frequencies @xmath64 or @xmath65 tuned to the lower state of single excitation ( of energy @xmath66 - @xmath10 ) .",
    "then the photon pairs generated via the upper state of single excitation ( of energy @xmath66 + @xmath10 ) would have energies which are different from @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then by performing spectral filtering we extract these photons . hence , one possible scheme would be to tune @xmath67 to the @xmath66 - @xmath10 state resonantly driving the @xmath69 transition , and consider spectral filtering of the @xmath70 and @xmath66 + @xmath10 . in order to estimate",
    "any property of the photon pairs generated via the cascade process we need the reduced density matrix where the bases are in the following order @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with photon frequencies @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "hence our major task is to find the density matrix , @xmath77 of this four dimensional ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) hilbert space , as once we know the @xmath77 density matrix we can extract any information for the classical and quantum correlations of the photon pairs generated in the qd - cavity system . the @xmath77 density matrix can be calculated by properly tracing out the @xmath82 density matrix describing the whole qd - cavity system . as the photon pairs @xmath83 are generated through cascade transitions through the @xmath84 or @xmath85 dressed states , we can describe this process by transition operators , @xmath86 acting on the total hamiltonian , @xmath87 .",
    "for example the transition operator which creates the @xmath88 pair is given by @xmath89    the density matrix , @xmath77 can be represented as @xmath90 where the coefficients @xmath91 are proportional to the @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "the proportionality coefficients are determined from the condition @xmath93=1 $ ] .",
    "for ( a ) @xmath94,(b ) @xmath95 and ( c ) @xmath96 . the highest degree of entanglement , for all cases , is observed at the center of the diagram and more precisely for the dressed states @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "figure.[fig : db ] shows eof as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath99 for fixed values of @xmath100 and the input field frequency at @xmath101 ( i.e. tuned at the lowest possible transition ) and with three different values of the biexciton binding energy . a relatively low value of @xmath12 of @xmath102 ( e.g. inas qd ) at fig.[fig : db](a ) , an intermediate value of @xmath103 ( e.g. gaas / alas qd ) at fig.[fig : db](b ) and a high one of @xmath104 ( e.g. cucl qd ) at fig.[fig : db](c ) .",
    "and @xmath105 states as a function of the biexciton binding energy.,title=\"fig:\",width=9 ]   and @xmath105 states as a function of the biexciton binding energy.,title=\"fig:\",width=9 ]    in all figures ( ( a ) to ( c ) ) it is apparent that the largest values of the entanglement reported by eof occur along the lines which correspond to resonant transitions of the upper four dressed states to the intermediate state ( of energy @xmath106 ) .",
    "the four major lines denote resonant excitations for the dressed state @xmath107 ( top curve with positive slope ) , @xmath97 ( second curve ) , @xmath98 ( third curve ) and @xmath108 ( bottom curve with positive slope ) .",
    "there are two more lines denote resonant excitations for the dressed state @xmath36 ( curve with negative slope between the intermediate single and triple curves ) and@xmath35 ( bottom curve with negative slope in plots ( a ) and ( b ) ) . for the high value of the binding energy ( plot ( c ) ) the two latter curves disappear or one changes slope . in the low and intermediate binding energies ( plots ( a ) and ( b ) ) , we find that there is a gap where the eof becomes zero .",
    "this disappearance of the entanglement originates by the fact that the transition amplitude @xmath109 becomes zero . under this condition",
    "we obtain that for @xmath110 , with @xmath111 @xcite . as expected , when we increased the binding energy this gap moved towards to the beginning of the excitation line of @xmath107",
    ". moreover , for small values of @xmath12 the dressed states @xmath98 and @xmath97 are almost degenerated but in our case this is not true .",
    "indeed , there are two regions of maximum entanglement at the center of the diagram which means that the two dressed states are not degenerated .",
    "this happens , as from @xcite we know the relation @xmath112 . as a result , for small values of the binding energy @xmath12 ,",
    "the value of @xmath113 is almost zero , thus the dressed states @xmath97 and @xmath98 are almost degenerate , which is not happen in our case as mentioned above .    by systematically investigating cases of binding energy higher than the one of @xmath104 ( figure[fig : db](c ) )",
    ", we have found that the eof diagram remains practically unchanged .",
    "the explanation of the latter behaviour is given by means of figure [ fig : ai ] where we reveal that the dressed states energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ai](a ) ) and the transition rates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ai](b ) ) remain unchanged above an binding energy at @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ fig : canvas ] shows the entanglement of formation ( eof ) for a wider range of g and @xmath115 .",
    "now we have also set @xmath116 .",
    "a thin line of maximum eof surrounded by a region where the entanglement is zero or very small , is observed at the center of the diagram between of excitation lines of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "additionally , we observe other thin lines of zero entanglement just under of the above line at the center of the diagram too , as well as under the line of excitation with the dressed state @xmath108 . actually under the line of @xmath108",
    "there are two thin lines of zero entanglement . from @xcite",
    "we know the relations @xmath112 as well as @xmath117 , where the @xmath43 is the difference between @xmath118 and the corresponding eigen - energies . by adding these relations we also have @xmath119 .",
    "these relations indicate the possible values but also give information about the forbidden values of @xmath43 .",
    "more specifically , it is evident that @xmath43 can not be zero for example as must be greater or smaller than this value . as a consequence ,",
    "there are forbidden areas in this figure where the entanglement becomes zero . in one of these lines , as mentioned above , there is a thin line of maximum .",
    "this happens because for @xmath120 there is a forbidden area but also there is resonance with the dressed state @xmath98 with @xmath121 , with @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath53 for @xmath95 , @xmath100 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    ", width=9 ]    finally , we systematically investigate the effect of the laser intensities .",
    "figure [ fig : erel](a ) shows the degree of entanglement as a function of g and @xmath115 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 whereas in figure [ fig : erel](b ) is @xmath127 and @xmath128 and all the other parameters are exactly the same .",
    "as it is easily observable the two diagrams are not symmetric to each other .",
    "this is because the left - polarized laser field is tuned to the state @xmath34 as we have @xmath129 , thus we have more excitations and as a consequence more generated entangled photon pairs in the second case . for this reason , in figure [ fig : erel](b )",
    "we have many regions with high degree of entanglement .",
    "we observe maximum eof along the lines which indicate resonant with the dressed states @xmath97 , @xmath130 ( with j=1,2,3 ) as well as the co - polarized state @xmath36 .     and",
    "there are maximums only for resonant with @xmath97 and @xmath98 and for ( b ) @xmath128 and @xmath127 .",
    "the entanglement has completely different behaviour in comparison to the previous case ( a).although should be noted that in both cases only two bell - states , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are generated.,title=\"fig:\",width=9 ]   and @xmath126 .",

    "the entanglement has completely different behaviour in comparison to the previous case ( a).although should be noted that in both cases only two bell - states , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are generated.,title=\"fig:\",width=9 ]    it is worth noting that the gap where the eof becomes zero across the line of @xmath107 still remains but this is not true for the maximum along the line of @xmath36 where instead of a maximum we observe a minimum .",
    "this is because the pairs which generated from the state @xmath36 or @xmath38 are not entangled any more since we use lasers with different amplitudes thus , the probability to have excitation with a right - polarized photon is greater than the corresponding probability of an excitation with a left - polarized photon .",
    "additionally there is a thin line of zero entanglement between the excitation lines of @xmath97 and @xmath98 . on the other hand , in figure [ fig : erel ]",
    "there are only two maximums along the excitation lines of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "obviously , the results will be reversed if one tunes @xmath67 laser frequency to the @xmath66 + @xmath10 state resonantly driving the @xmath133 transition , and consider spectral filtering of the @xmath134 and @xmath135 - @xmath10 .",
    "in summary , in the present work , we theoretically investigated the generation of polarization - entangled photons from a microcavity in which a qd is embedded in , radiated by two laser fields of opposite circular polarization ( left / right ) .",
    "our theoretical model relies on the dressed states scheme of the qd nanostructure considered as a four - level system and containing energies up to the order of the two exciton states ) .",
    "by systematically investigate the entanglement of formation , for various values of the important parameters of the quantum dot system as the bi - exciton binding energy and the intensities of the applied fields we have shown that there is a strong dependence of the quantum correlations on them .",
