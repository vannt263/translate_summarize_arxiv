    "the discovery of a sub - kpc central drop in stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath0-drop  in short ) in three seyfert galaxies with double bars ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) has brought this phenomenon to the foreground .",
    "in fact , a @xmath0-drop  was previously observed in a single object ( ngc6503 ) by @xcite .",
    "to explain the low velocity dispersion in the centre , @xcite had to built up a model with a distinct dynamically cold and compact isothermal nucleus in addition to the large scale stellar disc with the same mass - to - light ratio .",
    "others examples can be found in a few papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for instance ) but have been most probably overlooked because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of these observations .",
    "more recent observations of larger sample and better signal - to - noise ratio have confirmed ( @xcite , @xcite , emsellem et al . in preparation ) the presence of @xmath0-drop  in several single - barred galaxies .",
    "however , it is still premature to attempt to make statistics on the frequency of @xmath0-dropsin galaxies since a complete and systematic survey is not yet available .",
    "more challenging and not yet explained is the observation of @xmath0-drops  in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. ngc1404 , @xcite ) .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath0-drops  in such objects should deserve a detailed study .",
    "@xcite(hereafter paper  ii ) found that the stellar @xmath2  drop is the kinematical signature of stars born from a dynamically cold gaseous component .",
    "the origin of the drop results from the conspiracy of two factors .",
    "first , the new stars are concentrated toward the centre , and since they are just born from the low - dispersion gas component , their dispersion is much lower than for the old stars component .",
    "but second , the effect is amplified by the fact that the gas dispersion is also dropping toward the centre ( and therefore the new stellar component too ) .",
    "this is due to the strong accumulation of gas toward the centre , in a nuclear disk , where dissipation is stronger than elsewhere , and where the gas is therefore cooling down efficiently .",
    "the existence of flattened and rapidly rotating nuclear stellar discs has been predicted by @xcite and further studied by @xcite .",
    "they showed that such stellar discs could remain flattened for a long time since two body relaxation is a slow process .",
    "thus , a few issues remain opened :    1 .",
    "the frequency of @xmath0-drop  in galaxies depends on the lifetime of the phenomenon . in paper",
    "ii we were not able to give such an estimate .",
    "however , even if the frequency of this kinematical effect is still under unknown , it can be firmly stated that it is not a peculiar phenomenon since it is observed in an increasing number of ` normal ' galaxies .",
    "we give in table  [ tab : census ] an updated list of @xmath0-dropobservations .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath0-drops  have been detected using a number of absorption lines from the optical to the near infrared ( mg line triplet at @xmath3 5164 , 5173 , 5184  , ca triplet at @xmath4 8542 and 8662  , @xmath5co  molecular bands at roughly 2.29@xmath6 m , etc . ) which traces various ages of stellar populations .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-drops  can not be data reduction artifacts since stellar kinematics has been retrieved from absorption lines using various techniques .",
    "2 .   other mechanisms could be at work to remove some kinetic energy from the stellar component .",
    "for instance , a massive and concentrated dark halo seems to be able to generate a @xmath0-drop  in one of the simulations of @xcite ( their fig .",
    "3 .   beyond its intrinsic dynamical lifetime",
    ", the detectability of any @xmath0-drop  should be also limited by the lifetime of the stellar populations that have been used to trace the kinematics .",
    "for instance , in paper  i , @xmath0-drops  has been detected using the @xmath5co bandhead at 2.29  @xmath6 m .    in this paper",
    ", we will specifically address the problem of @xmath0-drop  lifetime using a new set of n - body experiments .",

    "an initial stellar population is set up to reproduce a typical disc galaxy .",
    "positions and velocities for @xmath12 particles are drawn from a superposition of two axisymmetric @xcite discs of mass respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( cf . table  [ tab : simul ] ) , of scale lengths respectively @xmath15 and @xmath16  kpc and common scale height of @xmath17  kpc .",
    "initial velocity dispersions are computed solving numerically the jeans equations .",
    "the initial disc radius is 30  kpc except for run h  for which the truncation radius is 50  kpc .",
    "the gaseous component of runs a@xmath18 , a@xmath19 , a@xmath20  and a@xmath21  is represented by 50000 particles for a total mass of @xmath22  m@xmath23 distributed in a 6  kpc scalelength miyamoto - nagai disc . for the collisionless run a@xmath24 @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been proportionally scaled so as to keep the same total mass than a@xmath18 .",
    "evolution is computed with a particle ",
    "mesh n - body code which includes stars , gas and recipes to simulate star formation when necessary .",
    "the broad outlines of the code are the following : the gravitational forces are computed with a particle  mesh method using a 3d polar grid with @xmath25 active cells , the hydrodynamics equations are solved using the sph technique and the star formation process is based on toomre s criterion for the radial instability of gaseous discs ( cf .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "since we used a log  polar grid , we have improved the pre - computation of self - forces by subdividing each cell in @xmath26 subcells .",
    "self - forces are then linearly interpolated before being subtracted from gravitational forces .",
    "when star formation is active , the radiative cooling of the gas has been computed assuming a solar metallicity .",
    "we have also checked that our results are independent of the radial resolution in the central 100  pc by using @xmath27 cells . in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] we display the region of the bar for various snapshots .",
    "more details on the global evolution of such kind of simulations , with similar initial conditions and star formation on a longer timescale can be found in @xcite for instance .",
    "compared to the simulations used in paper  ii , those described in the present paper are much more accurate since we have used 5 times more stellar particles and an improved n@xmath28body code .",
    "we will only deal with a case extract from a dozen of such simulations of various resolutions and initial setup .",
    "however , all our simulations display @xmath0-drops .",
    "the generic simulation a@xmath18  is thus representative of our database .",
    "another example of simulations with @xmath0-drops  are given in @xcite for a study of ngc1068 .",
    "apart from the smaller number of stellar particles ( @xmath29 particles ) , the setup of the stellar and gas distribution of run h  is similar to others runs .",
    "it includes an additional live dark halo made of @xmath30 live particles distributed in a plummer sphere of scalelength @xmath31  kpc and mass @xmath32  m@xmath23 .",
    "as our intention is to check the robustness of our results against the presence of the massive dark halo , a plummer sphere is a simple but sufficient description of the halo .",
    "the setup of initial velocities and velocity dispersions of disc particles is made consistently with the dark matter distribution .",
    "since the interaction between the extended live dark matter spheroid and the stellar / gaseous disc can not be computed with our particle  mesh code because of the limited vertical range of the grid code , run h  has been evolved with gadget , the tree - based n - body@xmath33sph code developed by @xcite .",
    "we used a adaptive time step based on the dynamical time and limited by the courant  friedrichs  levy condition .",
    "h  does not exhibit any significant stellar @xmath0-drop  up to 5.35  gyr although others kinematical and morphological stellar properties are roughly similar to halo - dominated models as those described by @xcite ( e.g. flat rotation curve , stellar ring encircling the bar , etc . ) .",
    "the stellar radial velocity dispersion is indeed rather flat , at @xmath34  km@xmath35s@xmath36  in the central 2  kpc at @xmath37  gyr . on the contrary , the radial velocity dispersion of the gas drops by 20  km@xmath35s@xmath36  in the central 8  kpc , approximately the diameter of the stellar bar .",
    "others runs , not displayed here , with more massive and/or more extended halos do not develop stellar @xmath0-drops  either .",
    "since our star formation recipes have not yet been implemented in gadget we are not able to check the combined effect of a live dark halo and star formation .",
    "the effect of a halo on the @xmath0-drop  formation thus deserves a much more in - depth study than the present one .",

    "to estimate the amplitude of a @xmath0-drop  ( hereafter @xmath40 ) , we have chosen to express it as the difference between two representative or mean values of @xmath0 : one outside the drop in the kinematically hot part of the bulge ( @xmath41 ) and one inside the drop , i.e. the central mean @xmath0 ( @xmath42 ) . moreover , we will only deal with @xmath43 for the sake of simplicity since the other two components of the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath44 ) also display the same effects ( cf .",
    "paper  ii ) .",
    "every value of @xmath43 is obviously a mass - weighted average since new particles may have different mass than initial ones .    to determine the value of @xmath42",

    "we made several trials with height - limited disc instead of a cylinder but we found no significant differences apart from a higher noise due to lower numbers of particles .",
    "the selection typically leads to particle numbers between 4000 and 10000 particles in the central 200  pc .",
    "after some trials , we decided to compute @xmath41  in two annuli .",
    "the first one , between 450 and 550  pc , represents a quiet region , outside the drop and the close surrounding region , but still in the region that could be considered as the bulge of the galaxy .",
    "the second one has been chosen between 250 and 350  pc as being representative of the maximum value of @xmath43 outside the central drop .",
    "the difference between @xmath41  in such a region and @xmath42  give an extreme value of @xmath0-drop .",
    "however , the radius of the maximum @xmath43 slightly increases during the evolution .",
    "we thus found more practical to only use the first annulus ( 450@xmath28550  pc ) to analyse into some details the typical @xmath0-drop  evolution although it slightly underestimates the real @xmath41  and thus the real depth of the @xmath0-drop .",

    "its evolution could be roughly separated into three phases .",
    "boundaries of these phases are approximately defined since they should depend on the details of the star formation history in the central region .",
    "@xmath40 remains approximately constant at 25  km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "the comparison with the pure n - body run a@xmath24  shows that such an amplitude is expected in case of a low star formation rate or no star formation at all .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in paper  ii that an artificial @xmath0-drop  of such a small amplitude is expected because of n - body softening effects . however",
    ", the amplitude of such a numerical @xmath0-drop  is much lower than those observed and should fully diseappear after convolution by any realistic point spread function .",
    "the sfr inside the central 200  pc is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] . for @xmath47",
    "myr the central sfr remains below 1  m@xmath1while most of the new particles are created in the large scale disc .",
    "thus , at @xmath48  myr , the mass of the new population roughly amounts to that of the gaseous component but remains an order of magnitude lower than the old population ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-drop  increase is now very significant so that @xmath40 reaches @xmath50  km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "this is the @xmath0-drop  growth phase which corresponds to the burst of star formation in the central region .",
    "however , such phase could be due either to the decrease of @xmath42  or to an increase of @xmath41 .    to disentangle both effects , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmaage ] the distribution of @xmath43 as a function of the epoch of particle formation for several selected times , up to @xmath51  myr .",
    "the two regions of reference are separately displayed .",
    "the old population is included in the first bin ( 0 - 25  myr ) .",
    "for each curve , the last bin represents the mean @xmath43 of the newest particle born during 25  myr before the corresponding time .    the @xmath43 distribution in the central 200  pc clearly shows an increase with time between @xmath52 and @xmath53  myr , for all generation of particles .",
    "the newest particles have a lower @xmath43 than the old population as expected . at each time , the shape of the histogram is roughly a linear relationship between @xmath43 and the epoch of particle formation . in first approximation ,",
    "the rate of heating is independent of the epoch of formation , i.e. the age of particles .",
    "this heating process stops around @xmath53  myr .",
    "the @xmath43 distribution then does not evolve any more for particles born between @xmath54 and @xmath53  myr .",
    "a number of particles born for @xmath55  myr gets into the central region from the outside ; these particles have a very high @xmath43 , greater than the old population , but their total mass is not high enough to increase @xmath42 .",
    "another way to represent @xmath42  evolution is to display separately the evolution of @xmath43 for the two particle populations of run a@xmath18(@xmath56  for the initial or ` old ' particles and @xmath57  for the ` new ' particles , i.e. for particles born during the run ) and for all the particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfoff ] ) .",
    "the control run a@xmath24  is also plotted to show the heating of collisionless particles for @xmath58  myr .",
    "such heating is mainly due the development of the stellar bar perturbation which increases the mass in the central region ( cf .",
    "paper  ii ) .",
    "run a@xmath24  can not develop a @xmath0-drop .",
    "however , this run allows us to estimate the increase of @xmath43 due to the secular heating of the central region .",
    "[ fig : sfoff ] ( top panel ) shows that @xmath42  clearly increases until @xmath59  myr and then slightly decreases to reach a plateau around @xmath42@xmath60  km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "the stellar mass in the central 200  pc is mainly made out of new particles , especially for @xmath61  myr ( fig  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "@xmath42  variations are thus strongly correlated to @xmath57  ones .",
    "the population of new particles responsible for this plateau ( those that are born at @xmath62  myr ) is made out in part of particles born inside the central 200  pc and in part of low @xmath43 particles that have migrated from the outside .",
    "the fraction of new particles which is born and stays in the central region vary from 25 to 10%  between @xmath53 and @xmath51  myr .",
    "thus , the migration of low @xmath43 particles from outside the central 200  pc takes over from particles born inside the central region when the local sfr strongly decreases after @xmath63  myr ( cf .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "this dynamical effect is obviously due to the strong growth of the central total mass which sinks the potential well .",
    "the evolution of @xmath41  is not driven by the same causes . indeed , the @xmath43 distribution in the 450 - 550  pc annulus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaage ] , bottom panel ) does not show any saturation of the heating process . on the contrary to the central region",
    ", there is no clear relationship between @xmath43 and the epoch of formation .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that new particles that are born in the annulus region can not stay there .",
    "thus , both @xmath56  and @xmath57  increase . as",
    "a consequence , @xmath41continuously grows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfoff ] , bottom panel ) , its values being moreover greatly dominated by @xmath56  since the old population represents most of the mass in the annulus .",
    "the @xmath0-drop  growth is thus due in great part to the heating of the surrounding region , since @xmath42  reaches a plateau .      during this phase",
    ", the @xmath0-drop  development seems to saturate .",
    "indeed , @xmath40 gains only 10  km@xmath35s@xmath36  in roughly 700  myr . in the central 200  pc , after @xmath51  myr , the slope of the relationship between @xmath43 and the epoch of formation changes for particles born after @xmath65  myr ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : sigmaageb ] ) . during this phase ,",
    "the heating is less efficient so that particles born after @xmath66  myr keep a low @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , most of the mass in the central region is due to particles born between 250 and 600  myr , i.e. during the burst of star formation ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath42  does not evolve ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : sfoff ] ) , as @xmath57 , even if @xmath56  continues to slightly increase .",
    "the 450 - 550  pc annulus being dominated by the old population , @xmath41is driven by the behaviour of @xmath56  which slightly increase by a few km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath57  is greater than @xmath56  during this phase .",
    "this effect is mainly due to particles born between 50 and 625  myr which cross this region",
    ". finally , since @xmath42  does not evolve , the small @xmath0-drop  fluctuations are again mainly due to the weak heating of the surrounding region .    for @xmath67  myr",
    ", @xmath45 fluctuates around a mean value of 65  km@xmath35s@xmath36 , with no significant sign of increase or decrease .",
    "thus , a @xmath0-drop  is not a transient feature .",
    "to throw some light on the matter of @xmath0-drop  lifetime , we have switched off the star formation process at three different times of run a@xmath18  and pursued the runs ( runs are named a@xmath19 , a@xmath20  and a@xmath21 ) for a while . for a@xmath19 , star formation has been stopped at @xmath68  myr , when the total star formation rate ( sfr ) is maximum ( roughly 20  m@xmath1 , cf .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "the simulation was then proceeded until @xmath69  myr . for a@xmath20 ,",
    "star formation has been stopped in the middle of the @xmath0-drop  growing phase ( @xmath53  myr ) whereas it has been switched off at @xmath70  myr for a@xmath21 , when the @xmath0-drop  is well developed and closed to be stable .",
    "the first obvious effect of switching off the star formation is the decrease of @xmath40 for all the three runs ( cf .",
    "[ fig : deltasigma ] ) . for run",
    "a@xmath19 , @xmath40 becomes even negative for @xmath71  myr which means that the central region becomes hotter than the rest of the galaxy .",
    "the heating timescale is very short .    as in sect .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , we need to disentangle @xmath43 variations for both representative regions and thus come back to fig .  [",
    "fig : sfoff ] where @xmath42  and @xmath41  of a@xmath19 , a@xmath20  and a@xmath21  are compared to those of a@xmath18 , as well as the contribution of @xmath56  and @xmath57  to @xmath42  and @xmath41 .    for @xmath72  myr ,",
    "the mass in the central 200  pc is dominated by the new population when star formation is active , so that @xmath42closely follows @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , the mass of the new population continuously increases when star formation is active ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) so as to equals the mass of the old population at @xmath73  myr .",
    "then , the new population dominates the central region .",
    "obviously , this is no more the case when star formation is switched off . indeed , between @xmath68 and @xmath53  myr , @xmath42  of a@xmath19  increases by @xmath50  km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "the rate at which @xmath57increases is higher ( @xmath74  km@xmath35s@xmath36  myr@xmath36 ) during the first @xmath75  myr than the following 150  myr ( @xmath76  km@xmath35s@xmath36myr@xmath36 , very close to the rate of run a@xmath24 ) .",
    "a marginal effect is the small heating of the old population ( @xmath77  km@xmath35s@xmath36  at @xmath53  myr ) .",
    "the heating of the new population is also very efficient in the 450 - 550  pc annulus but , since this region is dominated by the old population , the effect on @xmath41  is limited to @xmath78  km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "thus the heating of the central region is mainly responsible to the @xmath0-drop  disappearance .",
    "this heating has mainly two causes :    1 .",
    "the rapid gas accumulation in the central region strongly increases the central mass and makes local perturbations of the gravitational potential ; 2 .",
    "low-@xmath0 particles that escape from the central region are not replaced by new ones .",
    "indeed , the new population is made only in part of particles which are born and remain inside the 200  pc .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] how evolves the mass of this sub - population .",
    "it clearly decreases which means that a fraction of low-@xmath0 particles could be heated outside the central region , during their escape .",
    "when star formation is active , they are replaced at each timestep by the last generation of particles .",
    "this is no more the case for a@xmath19 , a@xmath20  and a@xmath21 .    for a@xmath20  and a@xmath21 , the decrease of @xmath40 has a longer timescale than for a@xmath19  even though the same mechanism than for a@xmath19  comes into play when the star formation is switched off .",
    "the amplitude of the decrease of @xmath40 is therefore smaller for a@xmath20  than for run a@xmath19 , and even smaller for a@xmath21 . since the central @xmath57  is roughly constant for @xmath79  myr for a@xmath18(cf .",
    "[ fig : sfoff ] ) , one can not invoke the effect of a colder population which needs more energy to be heated .",
    "in fact , the heating of the central region is much more difficult at @xmath53 or @xmath70  myr essentially because the mass of the new low-@xmath0 population is greater than the old one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "another cause is the bar itself . for @xmath80  myr",
    ", the gravitational perturbations made by the formation of the stellar bar have vanished .",
    "finally , there is also less gas accumulation in the centre than for a@xmath19  since star formation has consumed a significant fraction of the available reservoir in the central region .",
    "we confirm the result found in paper  ii that the appearance of a stellar @xmath0-drop  in hydro@xmath33n@xmath28body simulations is unavoidable on the condition that star formation is take into account . indeed , low-@xmath0 gas accumulates into a central disc because of the gravitational torques induced by the stellar bar .",
    "it gives raise to a new stellar population with the same velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-drop  appears quickly after the beginning of the bar formation , i.e. @xmath81  myr for our simulation a@xmath18 .",
    "it takes roughly 1  gyr to reach the maximum amplitude .",
    "then , the amplitude of the @xmath0-drop  remains constant ( @xmath82  km@xmath35s@xmath36 ) until the end of the simulation ( 2.1  gyr ) .",
    "timescales could however strongly depend on the star formation rate in the central region .",
    "a @xmath0-drop  is thus not a transient feature .",
    "however , all stellar populations , even low-@xmath0 particles , are heated , probably by fluctuations in the central region of the gravitational potential field as those described by , for instance , @xcite , or stochastic heating made by resonances between several density waves @xcite",
    ". however , in this paper , we did not investigate into details what could be the heating mechanisms since this deserves a dedicated study .",
    "the @xmath0-drop  persistence is thus not due to some improbable cooling mechanism .",
    "our experiments of switching off the star formation recipes at various epoch prove the relationship between this long lifetime and the refurbishment of the new stellar population of low-@xmath0 .",
    "a star formation rate as low as 1  m@xmath1  in the central 200 pc is enough to sustain a permanent @xmath0-drop  by replacing heated particles by new low-@xmath0 ones .",
    "such a rate is not uncommon in barred galaxies provided that the central region is regularly fed by fresh gas .",
    "moreover , when the star formation rate is too low , it will take several hundred myr for the @xmath0-drop  to disappear .",
    "this could explain why @xmath0-drops  are still observable in early - type galaxies with no sign of nuclear star formation ( e.g. ngc4477 ) .",
    "the visibility of a @xmath0-drop as well as its opposition to heating mechanisms , strongly depends on the mass ratio between the old ` hot ' population and the ` new ' cold one . for a@xmath18",
    "the central star formation rate reaches 5  m@xmath1  during the bar formation phase so as to create a new population which becomes more massive than the initial one at @xmath83  myr , thus on a rather short timescale .",
    "@xmath0-drops  should thus be rather common in barred galaxies in the local universe .",
    "a systematic survey of the central kinematics in barred galaxies could confirm these results .",

    "<S> we have made hydro / n - body simulations with and without star formation to shed some light on the conditions under which a central kinematically cold stellar component ( characterized by a velocity dispersion drop or @xmath0-drop ) could be created in a hot medium ( e.g. a bulge ) and survive enough time to be observed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the timescale for a @xmath0-drop  formation could be short ( less than 500  myr ) whereas its lifetime could be long ( more than 1  gyr ) provided that the central region is continuously or regularly fed by fresh gas which leads to a continuous star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> star formation in the central region , even at a low rate as 1  m@xmath1 , is mandatory to sustain a permanent @xmath0-drop  by replacing heated particles by new low-@xmath0 ones . </S>",
    "<S> we moreover show that as soon as star formation is switched off , the @xmath0-drop  begins to disappear .    </S>",
