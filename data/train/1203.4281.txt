    "asymmetric line profiles are frequently encountered , e.g. , in atomic photoionization due to a quantum mechanical interference between resonant and a nonresonant ionization pathways . according to the quantum mechanical analysis of fano @xcite",
    "the photoionization cross section as a function of photon energy @xmath0 in the vicinity of the resonance energy @xmath1 can be represented as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are slowly varying functions , @xmath5 is a reduced energy , @xmath6 is the natural ( lorentzian ) line width , and @xmath7 is the asymmetry parameter .",
    "the latter can be calculated theoretically from the transition matrix elements of the interfering resonant and nonresonant ionization channels .    as an example fig .",

    "the resonances are associated with dipole allowed double photoexcitation of the @xmath9 ground state to @xmath10 and @xmath11 states and subsequent autoionization .",
    "the principal quantum number @xmath12 depends on the photon energy . for @xmath13 both rydberg series converge towards the series limit at about 31.15  ev .",

    "@xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the experimental data the resonance lines can be fitted by a fano profile . in",
    "such fits the experimental photon energy distribution ( window function ) has to be taken into account . in many cases the experimental window function can be represented as a gaussian where the gaussian full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) corresponds to the experimental energy spread .",
    "thus , for a fit to the experimental data the fano profile has to be convoluted with a gaussian .",
    "the situation is similar to emission spectroscopy of hot gases where doppler broadening results in voigt line profiles , i.e. , the convolution of a lorentzian with a gaussian .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the voigt profile can be calculated efficiently from the complex error function @xcite ( also known as the faddeeva function ) .",
    "it is much less known that also the convolution of a fano profile with a gaussian can be represented by the complex error function .",
    "a corresponding rater simple formula has already been given in the appendix of a previous publication @xcite .",
    "the formula allows for a fast and accurate evaluation of the convolution in peak fitting routines . here",
    "its derivation is presented .",
    "it is noted that a different , more complex formula has been published earlier without its derivation @xcite .",
    "it seems , that this formula has not received much attention since even in more recent work the convolution of a fano profile with a gaussian has only been treated approximately or by numerical integration ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
