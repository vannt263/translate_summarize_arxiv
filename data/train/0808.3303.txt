    "it has been well known that many open - shell nuclei are deformed in the ground state .",
    "the nuclear deformation generates the collective rotational motion , which is characterized by a pronounced rotational spectrum as well as strongly enhanced quadrupole transition probabilities .",
    "theoretically , a standard way to discuss nuclear deformation is a self - consistent mean - field theory@xcite . by allowing the rotational symmetry to be broken in the mean - field potential , the mean - field theory provides an intuitive and transparent view of the nuclear deformation .",
    "e.g. , _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent systematic study of nuclear deformation based on the skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov method .",
    "the state - of - the - art mean - field approach also takes into account the effects beyond the mean - field approximation , such as the angular momentum projection and the configuration mixing @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent mean - field method has been extensively applied also to hypernuclei @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent experimental review on @xmath0 hypernuclei ) .",
    "these calculations have successfully reproduced the mass number dependence of @xmath0 binding energy , from a light nucleus @xmath5c to a heavy nucleus @xmath6pb .",
    "we notice that most of these calculations have assumed spherical symmetry . only recently",
    ", deformed calculations have been carried out in a broad mass region using the non - relativistic skyrme hartree - fock method @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have reported that the hypernuclei which they studied have a similar deformation parameter to the corresponding core nuclei with the same sign .    the aim of this paper is to study the deformation property of @xmath0 hypernuclei using the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) method , as an alternative choice of effective @xmath7 and @xmath8 interactions .",
    "the rmf method has been as successful as the skyrme - hartree - fock method in describing stable nuclei as well as nuclei far from the stability line@xcite .",
    "et al . _ have argued @xcite that the change in the nucleon spin - orbit potential due to the presence of @xmath0 particle is much more emphasized in the rmf approach as compared to the non - relativistic approach , since the spin - orbit potential in the former approach is actually given as a sum of scalar and vector potentials .",
    "that is , even if the change in the mean - field potential ( given as a difference of scalar and vector potentials ) is small , the change in the spin - orbit potential may not necessarily be small .",
    "therefore , a slightly different conclusion from that with the non - relativistic approach may result concerning the structure of hypernuclei .",
    "in fact , we will demonstrate below that the shape of @xmath4c and @xmath3si nuclei are drastically changed when a @xmath0 particle is added to them .",

    "we summarize the paper in sec . iv .",

    ", we neglect the tensor @xmath0-@xmath10 interaction .",
    "this is justified since we consider only the ground state configuration , in which the @xmath0 particle occupies the lowest @xmath17 single - particle state@xcite , @xmath18 being the projection of the single - particle angular momentum onto the symmetry axis .",

    "@xcite , that is , @xmath39 and @xmath40 mev for the neutron and the proton pairing gaps , respectively .",
    "( it has been known that these pairing gaps underestimate the deformation parameter of @xmath41ne nucleus when it is calculated with the nl3 parameter set@xcite .",

    "the dashed line is the deformation parameter for the even - even core nuclei , while the solid line is for the corresponding hypernuclei . for the ne isotopes ,",
    "the deformation parameter is always similar between the core nucleus and the corresponding hypernucleus , although the deformation parameter for the hypernucleus is slightly smaller than that for the core nucleus .",
    "this is consistent with the previous results with the non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock method @xcite . on the other hand , for the si isotopes , the deformation parameter for the @xmath43si nuclei is drastically changed when a @xmath0 particle is added , although the change for the other si isotopes is small .",
    "that is , the @xmath43si nuclei have oblate shape in the ground state .",
    "when a @xmath0 particle is added to these nuclei , remarkably they turn to be spherical .",
    "ne ( the dashed line ) and @xmath44ne ( the solid line ) nuclei obtained with the constrained rmf method with the nl3 parameter set .",

    "si and @xmath45si nuclei . ]",
    "the potential energy surfaces for the @xmath46ne and @xmath47si nuclei are shown in figs .",

    "the meaning of each line is the same as in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "in order to facilitate the comparison , we shift the energy surface for the hypernuclei by a constant amount as indicated in the inset of the figures . for the @xmath48ne nucleus",
    ", the prolate minimum in the energy surface is relatively deep ( the energy difference between the oblate and the prolate minima is 3.04 mev , and that between the spherical and prolate configurations is 3.63 mev ) , and it is affected little by the addition of the @xmath0 particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy surface for the @xmath3si nucleus shows a relatively shallow oblate minimum , with a shoulder at the spherical configuration .",
    "the energy difference between the oblate and the spherical configurations is 0.754 mev , and could be easily inverted when a @xmath0 particle is added .        in order to check the parameter set dependence of the results , we repeat the same calculation with the nlsh parameter set @xcite .",
    "the potential energy surface for the @xmath47si nuclei obtained with the nlsh set is shown in fig .",
    "one sees that the potential energy surface is qualitatively almost the same between the nl3 and nlsh parameter sets , although the @xmath0 binding energy is slightly different .",
    "namely , the oblate @xmath3si nucleus becomes spherical in the presence of @xmath0 particle , again with the nlsh parameter set .",
    "we also check the dependence of the results on the treatment of pairing correlation . for this purpose , we perform the calculations i ) without taking into account the paring correlation and ii ) with the constant force approach for the strength of the seniority pairing force . for the latter approach ,",
    "we determine @xmath49 and @xmath50 so that they lead to @xmath39 and @xmath40 mev for the ground state of each nucleus .",
    "( for instance , @xmath51 and @xmath52 mev for the nl3 calculation of @xmath3si nucleus . )",
    "we confirm that our conclusion remains the same for both the treatments of the pairing correlation , due to the fact that @xmath53 or @xmath54=14 is an oblate magic number@xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath0 particle significantly changes the deformation of @xmath3si nucleus , at least for the two parameter sets of the rmf lagrangian and irrespective of the treatment of pairing correlations .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in contrast , for the @xmath55si nuclei , the dependence on the parameter set and the treatment of pairing is much stronger .",
    "for instance , with the nlsh parameter set , the @xmath56si is slightly oblate and the deformation parameter is similar between @xmath57si and @xmath58si . without the pairing correlation , the deformation is similar between @xmath57si and @xmath58si for both nl3 and nlsh .",
    "apparently more careful investigations will be necessary for these nuclei before we can draw a definite conclusion on their deformation parameter .",
    "we summarize our results for @xmath43si and @xmath43si + @xmath0 in table i.    c and @xmath59c nuclei . ]    as another example which shows a large effect of @xmath0 particle on nuclear deformation , we next discuss the @xmath4c nucleus . for this nucleus ,",
    "the calculation with the nl3 parameter set did not converge , due to the instability of the scalar meson field @xcite , and we here show only the results with the nlsh set . fig .",
    "6 shows the potential energy surface obtained with the nlsh parameter set together with the constant gap approximation for the pairing correlation .",
    "the behaviour of energy surface of @xmath4c is similar to that of @xmath3si shown in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "that is , the energy surface has a shallow oblate minimum and a shoulder at the spherical configuration . for this nucleus",
    ", the energy difference between the oblate and the spherical configurations is as small as 0.13 mev . by adding a @xmath0 particle , the oblate minimum disappears and the ground state becomes spherical",
    "this is exactly the same effect of @xmath0 particle as that in the @xmath3si nucleus .",
    "for this light nucleus , the pairing correlation does not play an essential role , and we confirm that our conclusion remains the same even if we do not include the pairing correlation ( see table i ) .",
    "we have used the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory to investigate quadrupole deformation of @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "we have shown that , while an addition of @xmath0 particle does not influence much the shape of many nuclei , @xmath4c and @xmath3si make important exceptions .",
    "that is , we have demonstrated that the @xmath0 particle makes the shape of these nuclei change from oblate to spherical . for the @xmath3si nucleus",
    ", this conclusion was achieved both with the nl3 and nlsh parameter sets of the rmf lagrangian , although the calculation with nl3 was not converged for the @xmath4c nucleus due to the instability of sigma field .",
    "we have also confirmed that the conclusion is independent of the treatment of pairing correlation among the nucleons .",
    "an important next question will be how to observe experimentally the drastic structure change of the hypernuclei found in this paper .",
    "for this purpose , a measurement of the energy of the first 4@xmath60 state , and thus a deviation from a rotational spectrum , will be extremely useful .",
    "on the other hand , the potential energy surface for the @xmath2c and @xmath1si nuclei is somewhat soft and a large anharmonic effect of collective vibration might be expected .",
    "one may thus need to perform _",
    "e.g. , _ a generator coordinate method ( gcm ) calculation @xcite , on top of the mean field calculation presented in this paper , and calculate the excitation spectra before one can compare the theoretical results with experimental data .",
