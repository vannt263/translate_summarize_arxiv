    "<S> for a real borel measurable function @xmath0 , which satisfies certain integrability conditions , it is possible to define a stochastic integral of the process @xmath1 with respect to a brownian motion @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a diffusion driven by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well know that the stochastic exponential of this stochastic integral is a local martingale . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we consider the case of an arbitrary borel measurable function @xmath0 where it may not be possible to define the stochastic integral of @xmath1 directly . however </S>",
    "<S> the notion of the stochastic exponential can be generalized . </S>",
    "<S> we define a non - negative process @xmath4 , called _ generalized stochastic exponential _ , which is not necessarily a local martingale . </S>",
    "<S> our main result gives deterministic necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath4 to be a local , true or uniformly integrable martingale . </S>"
