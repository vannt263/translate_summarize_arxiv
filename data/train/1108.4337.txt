    "other codes can give slightly different values of the cross section for the same input parameters .",
    "furthermore the dependence of si cross section on not precisely known hadronic physics quantities can cause variations up to a factor five for a given point of the cmssm parameter space  @xcite . there is a further dependence of the si cross section on @xmath186 . anyway",
    "the choice @xmath0 is the benchmark case study also for direct searches of supersymmetric particles at lhc : atlas and cms typically present exclusion curves in the ( @xmath187 ) plane with @xmath0 and fixed @xmath2  @xcite . with the proposed formula , hence",

    "in this paper we have reviewed the formalisms and the approximations found in literature for the treatment of the sd neutralino - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "we argued that all that one needs to correctly take into account the detailed nuclear physics information provided by shell - model calculations is just one of the normalized structure functions of ref .",

    "we have shown that the factorization of the particle physics degrees of freedom from the nuclear physics momentum dependent structure functions implied by this formalism allows for a straightforward proof of the general formula  ( [ diseg ] ) proposed in ref .",

    "we have further discussed the ability of some of the present experiments and their future upgrade to larger active masses ( coupp and xenon100 ) to constrain the stau co - annihilation region of the cmssm . in this region of the parameter space",
    "the neutralino mass is in the interval 180 - 550 gev and the si cross section is a decreasing function of the mass for @xmath188 , taking values in the range @xmath189 pb and it is still poorly constrained by experiments .",
    "the sd cross sections , with the proton and the neutron , are in the range @xmath190 pb .    coupp , although the high sensitivity of  to the proton sd scattering and the fact that the sd neutralino - nucleon cross sections are larger than the si neutralino - nucleon cross section , can constrain the model in its large mass phase only by the si interaction with .",
    "the reasons are various : first , because of the @xmath89 scaling of the si neutralino - nucleus cross section ; second , there is a strong cancellation between the protons and neutrons contribution in the sd neutralino-  cross section ; third , the active mass of  is small .",
    "furthermore , in , for the considered particle physics model , the si rate is never negligible compared to the sd rate . in the case that the exposure were such that the model could be probed through sd scattering , an exclusion curve in the plane ( @xmath96 , @xmath139 ) would be inaccurate .",
    "finally we have given a fitting formula for the si neutralino - nucleon cross section in the stau co - annihilation region as a function of the two fundamental parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( @xmath188 ) that allows to directly convert an upper limit into an exclusion plot in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) plane for the case study @xmath0 .",

    "in this appendix we derive the formulas given in section  [ sec2 ] following the formalism of ref .  @xcite",
    "but with a simplified and slightly different notation .",
    "the neutralino - nucleon sd cross section is determined by the axial part of effective lagrangian . at the nucleon level , in the isospin representation that is convenient for nuclear physics calculations , we can write @xmath191 the operator @xmath192 act as @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 is the identity operator in isospin space .",
