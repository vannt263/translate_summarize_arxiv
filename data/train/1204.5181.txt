    "our ability to uncover the elusive properties of dark matter in galaxies is based on the analysis of velocities of stars . for the case of pressure - supported systems like elliptical galaxies ,",

    "higher order velocity information can be extracted from absorption line spectra .",
    "the shape of the velocity distributions is usually quantified within the framework of a gauss - hermite series , introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the advantage of this formalism is that hermite polynomials @xmath9 are orthonormal with respect to a gaussian weight function .",
    "the ( lowest order ) gauss - hermite moments measure structure in the central parts of the velocity distribution and have a limited dependence on the poorly - determined tails .    however , a disadvantage of the gauss - hermite formalism is that it can not be easily applied to the large class of problems in which the kinematic observations come in the form of discrete velocity measurements , rather than as line of sight velocity distributions extracted from absorption spectra .",

    "difficulties are mainly connected with the heterogeneous observational uncertainties and the probabilities of membership .",
    "additionally , a straightforward implementation of the methods of @xcite and @xcite is only possible for continuous data , thus introducing the potentially important loss of information due to data binning . in general",
    ", a dataset of discrete velocities @xmath10 comes together with a set of observational uncertainties @xmath11 , the values of which are usually inhomogeneous .",
    "also , the different kinematic tracers may have different probabilities of membership , @xmath12 , which should also be included .",
    "it is difficult to account properly for this information within the framework of a gauss - hermite series , as the binning procedure erases virtually everything except @xmath13 .",
    "for this reason , the accuracy of the results obtained can be seriously diminished if the observational uncertainties are large ( in terms of the intrinsic dispersion @xmath14 ) , and/or if either the observational uncertainties themselves or the membership probabilities are highly inhomogeneous .",
    "furthermore , whatever the sample size @xmath15 , the shape measured within the gauss - hermite framework is _ not _ the shape of the intrinsic velocity distribution @xmath16 itself , but rather the shape of its convolution with the uncertainties kernel , often taken to be gaussian .",
    "this causes an attenuation of the signal due to the intrinsic deviations from gaussianity in @xmath16 .",
    "the magnitude of this attenuation needs to be separately quantified and then simulated on models before direct comparison with the observables , which is a lengthy procedure .    given these difficulties ,",
    "it is clear that a feasible solution might be to use bayesian methods , which naturally allow us to include all available information , such as uncertainties of any origin , as well as probabilities of membership .",

    ", this may be viewed as a limitation of a bayesian framework , since any parametric family of velocity distributions may not be flexible enough to describe the dataset .",

    "this information provides powerful observables for future dynamical analyses of the dsphs , and will help constrain the mass profiles in these systems .",

    "finite samples of velocities naturally introduce some noise , which may be able to alter completely the intrinsic shape .    in general , the magnitude of the noise has its strongest dependence on the sample size @xmath15 .",

    "this result is approximately independent of the intrinsic shape of the velocity distribution : we find that the accuracy limits quantified here remain substantially unchanged for synthetic datasets extracted from non - gaussian distributions . as a consequence , for sample sizes less than 200 ,",
    "the accuracy of any measurement is potentially very low , which casts doubts on the reliability of results obtained using just a few tens of tracers .",
    "in fact , the situation is even worse , as the intrinsic signal in @xmath16 is also attenuated by the observational uncertainties on the discrete kinematic measurements .",
    "thus , it is highly likely that any deviation from gaussianity detected in small samples is an artefact of under - sampling and/or binning , rather than being real .",

    "apparent rotation is a potentially dangerous effect because it alters the shape of the observed velocity distribution . in particular , for the line of sight velocity distribution @xmath16 , the contribution of apparent rotation is degenerate with the signal produced by tangential anisotropy .",
    "for this reason , whenever possible , apparent rotation is usually subtracted from the dataset before estimating the shape of @xmath16 . nonetheless , it is useful to have an understanding of this spurious effect , since the subtraction of the apparent velocity field from the dataset does come at a price .",
    "it may , in fact , not be worthwhile degrading each discrete velocity measurement with the uncertainty of the apparent velocity field if the effect on @xmath16 is expected to be exceedingly small .    for simplicity",

    "all systems but fornax are characterized by line of sight profiles that are substantially more peaked than gaussian outside the centre .",
    "if interpreted following both  @xcite and  @xcite , this suggests a radially biased orbital structure in sculptor , carina and sextans .",
    "detailed dynamical modelling is required in order to quantify the orbital structure , and to assess the effects of the stellar density distribution as well as those of the unknown inclination . nonetheless , on a qualitative level ,",
    "the sharply falling photometric profile of the dsphs assures us that a significantly peaked velocity dispersion can be robustly associated with a radial bias of the orbits . on the other hand , fornax , shows line profiles that are flat - topped at large radii , hence perhaps favouring some tangential anisotropy .",
    "this suggests that it may have had a different recent accretion history to the other dsphs .",
    "support for this viewpoint is also provided by its distinctive shell structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also consider the angular behaviour of the asymmetric deviations from gaussianity . in fornax",
    ", we find a systematic angular trend , that we interpret as originating in a small level of intrinsic rotation .",
    "in fact , we find that this trend is mirrored in systematic residuals in the mean velocity with respect to the astrometrically determined proper motion .",
    "this is consistent with a mild intrinsic rotation about the minor axis , reaching about 1 kms@xmath83 in the radial range covered by the kinematic sample .",
    "our methods for characterizing the shapes of line profiles in discrete kinematic datasets are both powerful and adaptable . in recent times , the size and variety of such datasets has increased substantially , with applications that range from the kinematics of the globular cluster populations in relatively distant massive galaxies to precision kinematics of giant stars in our own galactic neighborhood .",
    "we anticipate that our methods will find ready application to a rich variety of datasets , and are actively pursuing further applications .",
