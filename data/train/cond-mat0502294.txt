    "the investigation of spin - liquid phases is currently a very active field of research , partly  but not only  because of their possible connection to the superconductivity observed in several cuprates .",
    "the definition of a `` spin liquid '' is itself a matter of debate . following the work of shastry and sutherland on a two - dimensional model",
    "whose exact ground state is a product of dimer singlets ,  @xcite the word is sometimes used to designate phases in which the spin - spin correlation function decays exponentially fast with distance at zero temperature .",
    "however , such phases often exhibit other types of long - range order , like dimer order , which manifest themselves as non - decaying correlation functions involving more than two spins .",
    "@xcite in that respect , the word liquid is not appropriate , and it should arguably be reserved to systems in which _ all _ correlation functions decay exponentially fast at large distance .",
    "this discussion would be quite academic if the only characteristic of such liquids was the _ absence _ of any kind of order , but following the pioneering work of wen ,  @xcite it is well admitted by now that such liquids can exhibit another property known as _",
    "topological order _ : in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state ( when defined on a topologically nontrivial domain ) exhibits a degeneracy not related to any symmetry and referred to as topological degeneracy .",
    "these degenerate ground states live in topological sectors which can not be connected by _ any _ local operator .",
    "the realization of such phases in quantum spin models is still preliminary though .",
    "the best candidates are frustrated magnets for which quantum fluctuations are known to destroy magnetic long - range order , but their ground - state properties are very difficult to access , and when definite conclusions are reached , it is usually because the presence of some kind of long - range order ( dimer , plaquette , etc . ) can be established .",
    "@xcite the main difficulty is in a sense technical : a good diagnosis would require to study large enough clusters , but this is not possible since quantum monte carlo simulations of frustrated antiferromagnets are plagued with a very severe minus sign problem .    in that respect ,",
    "effective models such as the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) are extremely interesting .",
    "although their relationship to actual heisenberg antiferromagnets is not a simple issue ,  @xcite they describe resonance processes typical of strongly fluctuating frustrated quantum magnets while retaining the possibility to be analyzed by standard techniques such as quantum monte carlo .",
    "this possibility was first exploited by moessner and sondhi ,  @xcite who developed a finite - temperature monte carlo algorithm to study the qdm on a triangular lattice defined by the hamiltonian :    @xmath0 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath1 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath2 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath1 [ 0.8ex ]",
    "@xmath3 + @xmath4 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath1 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath2 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath1 [ 0.8ex ] @xmath5    where the sum runs over all plaquettes including the three possible orientations . the kinetic term controlled by the amplitude @xmath6 changes the dimer covering of every flippable plaquette , i.e. , of every plaquette containing two dimers facing each other , while the potential term controlled by the interaction @xmath7 describes a repulsion ( @xmath8 ) or an attraction ( @xmath9 ) between dimers facing each other .",
    "since a positive @xmath7 favors configurations without flippable plaquettes while a negative @xmath7 favors configurations with the largest possible number of flippable plaquettes , the so - called maximally flippable plaquette configurations ( mfpc ) , one might expect a phase transition between two phases as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the actual situation is far richer though .",
    "as shown by moessner and sondhi , who calculated the temperature dependence of the structure factor , there are four different phases ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_diag_non_complete ] ) : * i ) * a staggered phase for @xmath11 , in which the ground - state manifold consists of all non - flippable configurations ; * ii ) * a columnar ordered phase for @xmath10 sufficiently negative ; * iii ) * an ordered phase adjacent to it called the @xmath12 phase where the structure factor develops a low - temperature peak at an intermediate value of the wave - vector and which probably consists of resonating plaquettes which make a @xmath13-site unit - cell pattern ; * iv ) * a liquid phase with a featureless and temperature - independent structure factor .",
    "this last phase has been interpreted as a short - range resonating valence bond ( rvb ) phase in which all correlations decay exponentially , even at low temperature .  @xcite it is separated from the staggered phase by a special point , the rokhsar ",
    "kivelson ( rk ) point ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "at this point , the ground - state manifold contains all staggered configurations plus another configuration of zero energy , the sum of all possible configurations . in that particular state",
    ", the dimer - dimer correlation function has been shown to decay exponentially with distance at zero temperature .",
    "@xcite     phase diagram of the qdm on the triangular lattice as a function of @xmath10 after ref .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    while the arguments put forward by moessner and sondhi in favor of this phase diagram are quite convincing , this proposal calls for further investigation for several reasons .",
    "first of all , this zero - temperature phase diagram was inferred from finite - temperature results , and a direct analysis of ground - state properties would be welcome . besides , the location of the phase boundaries is to a large extent unknown , as well as the nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different phases .",
    "finally , and more importantly , a direct investigation of the rvb phase would help to understand its physical properties .",
    "in particular , this phase is expected to be liquid in the strong sense of the word , and , as such , to have topological degeneracy , but this could not be checked by the finite temperature calculation of moessner and sondhi .",
    "in fact , this property , which lies at the root of ioffe et al s proposal for q - bits ,  @xcite has never been directly observed . as noticed by ioffe and collaborators on the basis of exact diagonalizations of small clusters ,",
    "the finite - size effects are still huge for the small cluster sizes accessible with that technique , and no conclusion regarding the thermodynamic limit could be reached .    in this paper , we address all these issues , and answer most of them , by a careful investigation of the zero - temperature properties of the model essentially based on the implementation of a green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) algorithm .",
    "the huge finite - size effects are shown to be a natural consequence of the subtle interplay between the cluster geometry , the order parameter of the underlying phase ( if any ) and the topological sector .",
    "this analysis turns the finite - size effects into a very powerful tool to investigate the ground - state properties of the model as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we have obtained strong evidence in favor of topological degeneracy close to the rk point , and we have been able to locate the transition between the two ordered phases with a reasonable accuracy .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the minimal technical background necessary to understand the results presented in the following sections . to keep this technical section as small as possible , some details have been relegated into appendices .",
    "we then discuss the various phases and the transitions between them in section iii , and finally we conclude in section iv .",
    "on the triangular lattice , the qdm has conserved quantities defining topological sectors ( ts ) .",
    "@xcite on finite clusters , these conserved quantities are defined by the parity of the number of dimers intersecting a given line which satisfies two properties : 1 ) it is closed , or it ends at the boundaries of the cluster ; 2 ) it does _ not _ divide the cluster into two disconnected pieces .",
    "the first condition ensures that the parity is conserved when applying the hamiltonian , while the second condition guarantees the possibility to construct configurations with both parities . on a cylinder ,",
    "the only choice is a line going from one end to the other , while on a torus , one can choose any closed loop that goes around one of the axis of the torus . since the sectors defined by two lines that can be deformed into each other continuously are the same , one ends up with two sectors for a cylinder and four sectors for a torus . in the following , we will work exclusively with clusters defined on a torus .      on the triangular lattice , it is possible to construct two types of clusters which keep all the symmetries of the infinite lattice .",
    "@xcite in terms of the basis vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 [ with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , they are defined by two vectors : @xmath19 with @xmath20 or @xmath21 for type - a clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ cluster_a ] ) and @xmath22 for type - b clusters ( see fig .  [ cluster_b ] ) .",
    "the clusters have the geometry of tori obtained by identifying sites of the infinite lattice modulo the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "since the number of sites must be even to accommodate dimers , we consider only clusters with @xmath20 even .",
    "the four topological sectors that we denote with ( 0,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,0 ) , and ( 1,1 ) can be defined by considering loops along @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the first ( resp .",
    "second ) number refers to the loop along @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) , and 0 ( respectively 1 ) stands for even ( respectively odd ) .",
    "remarkably , even on a finite cluster , three of the four sectors are always equivalent : this property is a consequence of the correspondence between sectors under rotations ( see appendix  [ section_ts ] ) and applies equally to type - a and type - b clusters , and , therefore , the three sectors have the same spectrum . however , which sectors are degenerate depends on the size of the cluster , according to the rule of fig .",
    "[ linked_ts ] .",
    "if the system is in a completely liquid phase with no long - range order at all , all topological sectors are expected to be equivalent up to finite - size effects , and each topological sector should contain one replica of the ground state . however , if some dimer order develops , this is no longer true , and the ground state will only be found in some sectors .",
    "the rule depends on the cluster size and on the type of order .",
    "the columnar order can only appear in the ( 0,0 ) sector , and , according to the rule of fig .",
    "[ linked_ts ] , in the ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) sector when @xmath29 is odd . on the other hand",

    "a few typical results are listed in the appendix  [ section_exact_diag ] . however , on the basis of these results only , not much could be said regarding the issues of topological degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit and of the phase transitions .",
    "fortunately , since all non - diagonal matrix elements are non - positive , the zero - temperature gfmc method could be implemented .",
    "@xcite in particular , we make use of the algorithm with a fixed number of walkers described in ref .  .",
    "the algorithm is ergodic at sufficiently large @xmath10 , except for the staggered configurations , which anyway play no role in the parameter range @xmath32 in which we are interested .",
    "however , the large energy barriers present for negative values of @xmath10 , typically @xmath33 , make it difficult to browse the configuration space efficiently . in particular , for very negative @xmath10 , the probability to sample states around the mfpc starting from a generic one becomes exponentially small , introducing serious ergodicity problems in the algorithm ( appendix  [ section_mfpc ] ) .",
    "results have been obtained with this algorithm for clusters with up to 588 sites . while no guiding function was required very close to the rk point , a guiding function favouring clusters according to the number of flippable plaquettes had to be implemented to keep a good statistics when decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "we now turn to the presentation of the results we have obtained starting from the rk point and decreasing toward the most negative values of @xmath10 affordable by gfmc . as mentioned previously , the analysis is based on a comparison of the ground - state energy in different topological sectors . since the sectors ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 )",

    "new results with respect to previous investigations could be obtained thanks to the combination of two factors : i ) the large sizes reachable with gfmc ( up to 588 sites ) ; ii ) the precise identification of the interplay between the cluster geometry , the topological sector and the nature of the ground state .",
    "the most important result of this paper is to provide the first direct numerical evidence that the four topological sectors on a torus are indeed degenerate in the thermodynamic limit in a finite range below the rk point , thus confirming the identification of this phase as an rvb phase by moessner and sondhi .",

    "the transition between the rvb phase and the @xmath12 phase is more difficult to pin down , but the behavior of the topological gap for large clusters suggests that it takes place between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "the correlation length increases away from the rk point , but we could not obtain a reliable evidence that it diverges , as would be the case for a continuous phase transition . in that respect , it would be very useful to implement a dynamical version of the gfmc algorithm to calculate the excitation gaps to vison and non - vison excitations inside a given topological sector ( thus extending beyond the rk point the results of ref .  ) .",
