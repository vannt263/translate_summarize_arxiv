    "there is increasing evidence that a large fraction of the nuclei of nearby galaxies show many similarities with powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ; these objects are termed low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ; active galaxies with nuclear l@xmath10 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath12 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1997a , hereafter h97a ) .",
    "these similarities include broad h@xmath9 lines ( ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , broader h@xmath9 lines in polarized emission than in total emission @xcite , nuclear uv sources @xcite and water vapor megamasers @xcite .",
    "however , the emission - line spectra of llagns ( i.e. low - luminosity seyferts , liners , and `` transition '' nuclei [ nuclei with spectra intermediate between those of liners and h  ii regions ] ) , can also be modeled in terms of photoionization by hot , young stars @xcite , by collisional ionization in shocks @xcite , or by aging starbursts @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not clear that accretion onto a black hole powers all llagns .",
    "how does one distinguish accretion - powered llagns from llagns powered by hot stars or supernova shocks ?",
    "broad h@xmath9 lines and bright unresolved optical or uv sources are ambiguous indicators because they can all be produced in starburst models ( see terlevich et al .",
    "1992 ) , and a search for broader polarized h@xmath9 emission is currently feasible in only a few of the brightest llagns @xcite .",
    "further , all these indicators are highly dependent on viewing geometry and obscuration and on the signal to noise of the observations , a problem exacerbated by the low optical and uv luminosities of llagns .",
    "their observation demands both high signal - to - noise spectra and high spatial resolution to separate weak nuclear emission lines from the starlight of the host galaxy .",
    "one well - known property of some powerful agns is a compact , flat - spectrum nuclear radio source , usually interpreted as the synchrotron self - absorbed base of the jet which fuels larger - scale radio emission .",
    "astrophysical jets are known to be produced in systems undergoing accretion onto a compact object ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so such compact radio sources in galactic nuclei may reasonably be considered a signature of an agn . much theoretical work",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been devoted to this disk - jet relationship in the case of galactic nuclei and it has been suggested that scaled - down versions of agn jets can produce flat - spectrum radio cores in llagns @xcite .",
    "nuclear radio emission with an inverted spectrum is also expected from an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a possible form of accretion onto a black hole at low accretion rates @xcite , or from bremsstrahlung , cyclotron and synchrotron emission from plasma accreting quasi - spherically onto a black hole @xcite . from the observational perspective",
    ", @xcite showed that liner nuclei tend to be associated with a compact radio source , and compact , flat - spectrum radio cores are known to be present in many ` normal ' e / s0 galaxies @xcite . flat - spectrum radio cores are , however , uncommon in normal spirals or seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "flat - spectrum radio sources can also result through thermal emission from optically - thin ionized gas or through free - free absorption of non - thermal radio emission , a process which probably occurs in compact nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature , t@xmath13 , in such starbursts is limited to log  [ t@xmath14(k ) ]  @xmath6 5 @xcite .",
    "thus it is necessary to show that t@xmath13 exceeds this limit before accretion onto a black hole can be claimed as the power source .    in this paper",
    ", we present a high - frequency ( 15  ghz or 2  cm ) , high - resolution ( @xmath15  015 ) survey of llagns with the very large array ( vla , * ? ? ?",
    "this resolution is high enough to isolate nuclear emission from that of the host galaxy , and the radiation is unaffected by the obscuration present at uv or optical wavelengths , and less affected by free - free absorption than observations at longer cm wavelengths .",
    "further , large samples can be quickly studied , as deep radio maps are achievable in as little as 1520 min per object .",
    "higher resolution follow - up observations are then required in order to eliminate the possibility that the radio cores are thermal in origin , as discussed above .",
    "we have therefore embarked on a program to observe a large number of llagns at high resolution with the vla and the very long baseline array ( vlba , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to identify accretion - powered nuclei , to test the predictions of adaf and jet models , and to characterize the presence and structure of radio jets on sub - pc to hundred - pc scales . in this paper , we report on the results of the first stage of this program  vla observations of 48 llagns which have been extensively observed at other wavebands .",
    "preliminary results of this project have been published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a total of 48 galaxies were selected from the magnitude - limited palomar spectroscopic survey of 486 nearby bright galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1995 ) .",
    "all 48 galaxies were originally selected , using preliminary spectral classification , to have nuclei with `` pure '' liner or `` transition object '' ( composite liner  +  h  ii ) characteristics .",
    "the spectral type of 8 of the nuclei was somewhat uncertain , and these galaxies were later reclassified as seyferts ( h97a ) .",
    "thus , our sample of 48 llagns consists of 22 `` pure '' liners , 18 `` transition objects , '' and 8 low - luminosity seyferts .",
    "the 48 objects were not selected by well - defined criteria ; they were individually chosen for study at multiple wavelengths because they were particularly `` interesting '' llagns .",
    "our sample is the subject of a rigorous observational campaign involving radio observations at 2  cm ( reported here ) , 3.6  cm and 6  cm @xcite , _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ optical @xcite and uv imaging @xcite as well as spectroscopy @xcite , and x - ray imaging by the _",

    "( whose nuclear spectrum is that of an h  ii region ) and ngc  5756 ( a southern spiral not in the palomar spectroscopic survey )  were observed by the vla over three runs on 1996 october 7 , 11 and 18 , while the array configuration was being changed from ` d ' to ` a ' ( see thompson et al .",
    "1980 for a description of the vla configurations ) .",
    "the weather was fair for all runs with clear skies and temperatures between 0 and 23c .",
    "two 8 min observations of each galaxy were sandwiched between three 2 min observations of a nearby phase calibrator , so that the total time on source was typically 16 min .",
    "for the october 7 run , there were 9 antennas at a - configuration pads plus 18 antennas at d - configuration pads .",
    "five d - configuration antennas were taken out of the array at various times during the run to be moved to their a - configuration pads ; they did not start observing again until after our run was completed .",
    "a sixth d - configuration antenna was removed from the array for painting .",
    "of the nine antennas at a - configuration pads , the data from the three most recently moved were unusable , since the antenna positions were poorly determined .",
    "for the october 11 run , 25 of the 27 antennas were on their a - configuration pads , but the data from the four most recently moved antennas were unusable as their positions were poorly determined .",
    "for the october 18 run , all except one of the antennas were at their a - configuration pads , and all had reasonably well - determined positions .",
    "the data were calibrated using the aips software , following the standard procedures outlined in the aips cookbook .",
    "since positions for recently - moved antennas were not well determined at the time of observations , antenna positions listed in the data files were updated with the corrections to the positions found by vla operators over the few weeks after the observations .",
    "we found that using all position corrections up to those determined on november 23 , 1996 , led to the best calibrator phase solutions for most of the recently - moved antennas .",
    "other bad data were removed before the phase solutions , derived from the phase calibrators , were applied to the target galaxies . on the october 7 and october 18 runs ,",
    "the source 1328 + 307 ( 3c  286 ) was observed twice and used to set the flux - density scale to that of @xcite . on the shorter october 11 run , an observation of 0404",
    "+ 768 was used to set the flux - density scale ( we used a 2  cm flux - density of 1.46  jy for this source ) .",
    "the phase calibrator flux - densities were bootstrapped to that of 0404 + 768 , and the bootstrapped values were found to be in good agreement with those listed in the vla flux - density database ( part of the `` vla calibrator manual '' ; available on - line at http://www.nrao.edu ) .    the maps were made with aips task imagr . for the october 7 run , we imaged each object twice , once using only the antennas on d - configuration pads , which resulted in @xmath155-resolution maps , and once using only those baselines which included at least one antenna on an a - configuration pad , which resulted in @xmath15015 resolution maps .",
    "for the other two runs , a single map was made for each source , using all antennas . for sources stronger than about 3  mjy",
    ", we were able to iteratively self - calibrate the data so as to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the final map .",

    "noise in the maps prior to self - calibration was 0.1  mjy .",
    "many of the maps of the undetected nuclei show 4 to 5  @xmath16 peaks at various locations in the map .",
    "we therefore conservatively use 10 times the r.m.s .",
    "noise in the map as the upper limit for the flux density of the undetected sources , so the sensitivity of our survey is about 1.1  mjy .    on the october 11 run , ngc  266 , ngc  404 , and ngc  7217",
    "were also observed at 0.7  cm and 3.6  cm , with the vla split into two subarrays which observed at different frequencies ( not all antennas had 0.7  cm receivers ) .",
    "these data were reduced as described above .",
    "an observation of 0404 + 768 was used to set the flux - density scale at 0.7  cm .",
    "we set the 0.7  cm flux density of 0404 + 768 to 578.2  mjy for the ac if s and 575.3 for the bd if s , after finding , from the vla flux - density database , that these were the flux densities on 1997 february 24 , the date closest to our run that the source was observed ( the flux density stayed between 500 and 600  mjy for the following @xmath15300 days ) . the flux density of the phase calibrators , 0055 + 300 and 2201 + 315 , were bootstrapped to that of 0404 + 768 , and the results were consistent with the values listed in the flux - density database . at 3.6  cm , the observation of 3c  48 could not be used to set the flux - density scale , as the four innermost antennas ( and almost every alternate antenna on each arm ) were observing at 0.7  cm , so that none of the 3.6  cm interferometer baselines was small enough for an accurate flux - density calibration solution ( the vla calibrator manual specifies that a - configuration observations of this calibrator should be restricted to 040 k@xmath0 ) .",
    "we therefore set the flux density of 2201 + 315 ( the phase calibrator for ngc  7217 ) to 2.51  jy in both ac and bd if s at 3.6  cm , as this was its measured value on 1997 january 17 , the date closest to our run ( after this date , the flux density of this source rose steadily to 3.5  jy over the next @xmath15300 days and then stayed roughly constant ) .",
    "the flux density of 0055 + 300 ( the phase calibrator for ngc  266 and ngc  404 ) was then bootstrapped from that of 2201 + 315 .",
    "the result , s(0055 + 300 )  = 0.82 jy , is consistent with the values listed in the flux - density database for this source .",
    "nevertheless , the 3.6  cm and 0.7  cm flux densities of the three galaxies are subject to additional uncertainty .",
    "all data were calibrated and imaged independently by two of us ( nmn and hf ) , yielding consistent results ( all corrections for antenna positions were also independently done ) .",
    "we are therefore confident of the results , despite the uncertainties caused by the uncertain antenna positions .",
    "the results of the vla observations are listed in table 1 , with columns explained in the footnotes .",
    "the radio positions for the 22 detected objects are limited by the positional accuracy of the phase calibrators , which is typically 210  milli - arcsec ( mas ) , and by the accuracy of the gaussian fit to the source brightness distribution , which depends on the signal to noise ratio of the source detection . the overall accuracy should typically be better than @xmath1550  mas for all target sources detected in a - configuration , and better than 500  mas for target sources detected in only d - configuration .",
    "we have compared the radio positions derived here with optical positions from cotton , condon , & arbizzani ( 1999 ) , which were measured from the digital sky survey with typical 1@xmath16 accuracy 1525 in each of right ascension and declination . for all but two of the 2  cm detected nuclei , the radio and optical positions agree to within 135 ( see table 1 ) . in ngc  185 and",
    "ngc  4550 , the offsets between radio and optical positions are significant , and as discussed in appendix a , it is possible that the radio sources we detected in these two galaxies are not related to the galaxy nucleus .    assuming that the radio sources towards ngc  185 and ngc  4550 are in fact associated with their nuclei , the detection rate of 2  cm radio cores in the a - configuration maps of our llagn sample is 37% ( 18 of 48 ) , at a 10@xmath16 detection limit of 1.1  mjy .",
    "the rate is more striking if we consider the detection rates for low - luminosity seyferts ( 75% ; 6 of 8) and for liners ( 50% ; 11 of 22 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only one of the 18 observed ` transition ' nuclei was detected .",
    "the morphological type of the galaxy with the detected transition nucleus , ngc  5866 , is one of the earliest of the transition objects observed .",
    "an additional four objects were detected in d- but not a - configuration maps ; we do not consider these four as nuclei with compact 2  cm radio cores . in comparison , @xcite detected 30% ( 64 of 210 ) of all e / s0 galaxies with d @xmath17 40 mpc and m@xmath18 @xmath17 14 mag in a 6  cm vla survey with resolution 5 and 10@xmath16 detection limit 1  mjy ; the lower resolution and lower frequency make their survey more prone to detecting emission from sources unrelated to the central engine .",
    "the radio luminosities of most of the detected 2  cm cores are between 10@xmath19 and 10@xmath20 w hz@xmath12 ( fig .  1 ) ,",
    "similar to the luminosities seen in ` normal ' e / s0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is notable , however , that a significant fraction of the detected 2  cm compact cores are in spiral galaxies ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the 0.7  cm maps of ngc  404 , ngc  266 , and ngc  7217 were , as expected , noisy , and all three galaxies were undetected at a 10@xmath16 limit of 10  mjy . at 3.6  cm ,",
    "ngc  266 and ngc  7217 were detected as unresolved sources with flux densities 3.1  mjy and 1.2  mjy , respectively , while ngc  404 was not detected at a 10@xmath16 upper limit of 0.9  mjy .",
    "none of the objects show reliable extended structure in either a- or d - configuration maps .",
    "this is not surprising as the high resolution may resolve out most extended emission , which is expected to be weak at the high frequency observed .",
    "for a few sources , a gaussian fit ( with peak flux - density , major and minor axes as free parameters ) to the nuclear radio source brightness distribution results in a gaussian size slightly larger than the beam size so that the peak flux - density is slightly smaller than the total flux - density ( see table 1 ) ; however , the deconvolved source sizes are much smaller than half the beam size , so we consider these sources as unresolved . of the 8 objects which are detected in both our a- and d - configuration maps , ngc",
    "2655 is the only one with significantly more flux density at 5 resolution than at 015 resolution .",
    "thus , most of the detected 2  cm nuclear radio sources are compact at the 015 resolution ( typically 1525  pc ) of our survey .",
    "the implied brightness temperatures for the 2  cm compact nuclei are t@xmath13  @xmath4 10@xmath21  k except for ngc  4278 and ngc  6500 which have t@xmath13  @xmath4 10@xmath22  k , and ngc  185 , ngc  4548 , ngc  4550 , ngc  4636 and ngc  5033 which have t@xmath13  @xmath4 10@xmath23  k.    we have supplemented our 2  cm observations with radio data at other wavelengths from the literature , such as the 6  cm radio survey of @xcite and the 20  cm vla first survey catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter first ) , in order to derive non - simultaneous spectral indices for the 2  cm detected nuclei ; details of the spectral index determination are listed in appendix a for each galaxy detected at 2  cm .",
    "while the actual value of the spectral index is uncertain , given the resolution mismatch and the non - simultaneity of the observations , we can determine whether the core is flat spectrum ( @xmath240.3 ; s@xmath25 ) , or steep spectrum ( @xmath260.3 ) , as noted in column 13 of table 1 .",
    "since compact flat - spectrum radio sources are often variable , the use of non - simultaneous data at two frequencies can cause some intrinsically flat - spectrum radio sources to be misclassified as steep - spectrum sources .",
    "however , since extended steep - spectrum radio sources are not variable , the use of non - simultaneous data at two frequencies should rarely cause intrinsically steep - spectrum radio sources to be misclassified as flat - spectrum sources .",
    "also , since the resolution is better at the higher frequency , resolution effects will tend to steepen the measured spectrum if extended emission is present .",
    "thus we are confident of the reality of the flat spectra obtained .",
    "fifteen of the 18 objects detected in our a - configuration 2  cm maps show a flat - spectrum radio core , and one has an undetermined radio spectrum .",
    "the remaining two objects detected in the a - configuration 2  cm maps , ngc  2655 and ngc  4636 , show evidence for the presence of a steep - spectrum radio core , although ngc  4636 has `` jet''-like steep - spectrum nuclear radio extensions @xcite which may dominate over any flat - spectrum nuclear component within the beam of the radio maps . in the case of ngc  2655 ,",
    "the inferred steep - spectrum of the nucleus is consistent with the presence of extended 2  cm radio emission .",
    "the radio morphology of the llagns detected at 2  cm is different from what is seen in `` classical '' seyferts @xcite , where the nuclear radio emission is usually dominated by steep - spectrum `` jet '' or double radio components on tens to hundreds of pc scales , and any pc - scale radio core may potentially be hidden by free - free absorption at cm wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high incidence of compact , flat - spectrum radio cores in the spiral galaxies in our sample is unusual ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the high incidence of flat - spectrum radio cores in low - luminosity seyferts is also unusual , given that flat - spectrum compact radio cores are found in only about 10% of `` classical '' seyferts @xcite .      correlations between the emission - line and radio luminosities of active galaxies are well known , and are found in both seyfert @xcite and radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the [ o  iii ]  @xmath05007 line is usually used in assessing these correlations , but this line is weak in liners and we use instead [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 , which also has the advantage of being uncontaminated by emission from h  ii regions . in our llagn sample , the 2  cm radio power appears closely correlated with the nuclear [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosity ( fig .",
    "2a and 2b ) .",
    "testing the statistical significance of this apparent correlation is not straightforward as there exist both upper limits ( line not detected ) and highly uncertain values ( non - photometric data ) for the [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities , along with upper limits to the 2  cm radio powers .",
    "eight of the llagns in the sample have non - photometric [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 flux densities .",
    "we treated these eight flux densities as photometric measurements when using the bivariate tests from the asurv statistical software package ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter asurv ) .",
    "this approximation should not bias the results significantly as the uncertainties in the flux density are expected to be much less than an order of magnitude .",
    "when this is done , tests on the whole sample indicate a correlation between the radio and [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities at the 97% significance level . deleting ngc  185 ( the point at the bottom left corner of fig .",
    "2a ) , for which the association of the radio source with the nucleus is uncertain ( section 3.1 ) , lowers the significance level by only 1% .",
    "do the llagns undetected at 2  cm truly lack radio cores , or do a significant fraction of them have radio cores which are weaker than those in the detected llagns because of , for example , a lower bulge luminosity @xcite or a later morphological type ? the distributions of host galaxy bulge luminosity and distance ( as listed in h97a ) are more or less similar for the detected and undetected liners .",
    "the 2  cm compact core liners have a median host galaxy morphological type ( t@xmath27= @xmath21.5 ) which is earlier than , and a median [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosity ( log  l@xmath28}$](median )  = 31.5 watts ) which is higher than , that for liners without compact 2  cm cores ( t@xmath27= 2.0 , log  l@xmath28}$](median )  = 31.1 watts ) , though the difference is not statistically significant . given the correlation between emission - line and radio luminosity , it is possible that deeper radio imaging will find compact radio cores in the 2  cm undetected liners .",
    "the host galaxies of the two undetected seyferts have bulge luminosities in the b band among the lowest of the eight seyferts in our sample .",
    "there is no clear difference between the morphological types of the detected and undetected seyferts .",
    "seventeen of the non - detected nuclei are `` transition objects . ''",
    "statistical tests from the asurv package indicate that the distributions of the 2  cm radio power of liners and transition objects in the sample are different at a confidence level of 99.399.5% . while the numerical value of the significance level is questionable given that there is only one detection among the transition objects , arbitrarily changing the four transition objects with the lowest radio flux - density upper limits into radio detections still results in a difference between transition object and liner radio powers at the 9298% significance level .",
    "while the transition nuclei have somewhat lower median bulge luminosities and generally later morphological types compared to the detected liners , the statistical significance of these differences is not high .",
    "not unexpectedly , the transition objects in our sample do appear to have weaker [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities as compared to the liners and seyferts ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "if the non - photometric [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 flux measurements are considered to be accurate , statistical tests from the asurv package indicate that in our sample the [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities of the transition objects are lower than that of liners and seyferts at the @xmath1599.8% significance level .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this luminosity difference is large enough to explain the striking difference in the detection rates .",
    "surprisingly , the one transition nucleus detected at 2  cm , ngc  5866 ( the rightmost circle in fig .",
    "2b ) , has one of the lowest [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities among the transition nuclei .",
    "we find compact 2  cm radio cores in both type 1 and type 2 nuclei , that is , those with and without visible broad h@xmath9 emission .",
    "furthermore , some type 1 nuclei in our sample ( two seyferts and four liners ) do not have a compact radio core at our detection limits . among liners ,",
    "64% ( 7 of 11 ) of type 1 nuclei host compact radio cores , as compared to only 36% ( 4 of 11 ) of type 2 nuclei .    additional evidence supports the accretion - powered nature of the nuclei with compact , flat - spectrum 2  cm cores .",
    "ngc  4579 is one of the very few llagns with a detected fe  k@xmath9 line ( terashima et al . 1998 , 2000 ) ; such lines are believed to originate through fluorescence in an accretion disk .",
    "the optical  uv spectrum of ngc  4579 has been studied in detail by @xcite , who show that the broad - line region in this object is detectable in a number of permitted transitions .",
    "the broad - band spectral energy distribution of ngc 4579 @xcite has been interpreted in the context of an adaf model @xcite .",
    "ngc  4278 and ngc  6500 are both known to harbor pc - scale radio cores studied with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques @xcite , and ngc  4203 @xcite , ngc  4278 and ngc  4636 @xcite show kinematic evidence for massive dark objects at their centers .",
    "@xcite find that the nuclei of ngc  404 , ngc  4569 , and ngc  5055 , all undetected at 2  cm , contain massive stars which probably generate sufficient ionizing photons to power the optical emission lines , so it is not necessary to invoke an accretion - powered source . on the other hand , they find that the nuclei of m  81 , ngc  4594 , and ngc  6500 ( and perhaps ngc  4579 ) exhibit a severe `` deficit '' in ionizing photons ( i.e. apparently insufficient photons shortward of the lyman limit , as inferred through extrapolation of the observed uv spectrum , to power the optical and uv emission lines ) , but their x - ray / uv ratios are two orders of magnitude higher than those of the three stellar - powered liners .",
    "@xcite concluded that , in these four objects a component that emits primarily in the extreme - uv may be the main photoionizing source .",
    "we observed and strongly detected two of these nuclei ( ngc  4579 and ngc  6500 ) at 2  cm , and the other two are known to have pc - scale radio cores @xcite . finally , the lack of clear evidence for x - ray emission from an agn in ngc  404 , ngc  4111 , ngc  4192 , and ngc  4569 @xcite , galaxies undetected at 2  cm , is consistent with an absence of an accretion - powered source .      a significant number of the llagns with 2  cm compact radio cores in our sample show extended 20  cm radio emission in 5 resolution first maps , and/or 154 maps from other sources ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we therefore compared the p.a .",
    "of this radio extension , when available , with that of the host galaxy major axis for all llagns in our sample which host 2  cm compact radio cores .",
    "the relevant p.a.s are listed in table 2 , and a histogram of the difference in the two p.a.s , @xmath29 , is shown in fig .",
    "the single transition object ( shown in grey ) shows extended emission along the host galaxy major axis , so it is likely that the radio emission is from the galaxy disk .",
    "on the other hand , liners and low - luminosity seyferts with compact 2  cm radio cores appear to favor extended radio emission along the galaxy disk minor axis , although the small number of objects prohibits any meaningful statistical tests .",
    "the extent of this minor - axis radio emission is typically only 05 to 3 ( 50350  pc for most galaxies in the sample ) , and could trace the inner parts of wide - angle , minor - axis outflows , as seen in classical seyferts @xcite , or low - luminosity collimated `` jets '' from the central engine .",
    "we have detected unresolved 2  cm nuclear radio emission in 75% of low - luminosity seyferts and 50% of liners .",
    "at least 83% of these nuclear radio sources have flat radio spectra . at this point",
    "it is not clear whether the 2  cm non - detected liners and low - luminosity seyferts really do not have compact radio cores , or whether their compact cores simply have lower radio luminosities or are hidden by , for example , free - free absorption . in powerful agns , compact flat - spectrum nuclear radio cores",
    "are widely accepted as the signature of synchrotron emission from the base of a synchrotron self - absorbed jet ( see the review by zensus 1997 ) .",
    "the compact , flat - spectrum radio cores we detect in llagns could be scaled - down versions of powerful agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or could trace emission from an adaf @xcite , or material undergoing quasi - spherical accretion @xcite . alternatively , the radio cores could be produced by thermal bremsstrahlung from ionized gas or by synchrotron radiation which has suffered free - free absorption .",
    "such emission could originate from an active nucleus or nuclear star forming regions .",
    "the lower limits to the brightness temperatures , t@xmath30 , of the 2  cm compact core objects in our sample are 10@xmath5  k , so the vla observations alone can not rule out the notion that the radio emission originates in star formation regions .",
    "however , most objects have brightness temperatures too high to be optically - thin thermal emission from a gas at 10@xmath31  k. the expected value of t@xmath13 is @xmath15 10@xmath31  k ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the observing frequency and @xmath34 is the frequency at which the source becomes optically thick .",
    "many of our objects have a flat spectrum between 2  cm and 20  cm suggesting @xmath34  @xmath17 1.4  ghz ( 20  cm )",
    ". if this is the case , then thermal emission must have t@xmath35 k i.e. @xmath17  90  k , lower than all of our measurements .",
    "further , higher resolution observations of 10 of the detected objects in this sample reveal brightness temperatures @xmath36  10@xmath8  k , strongly suggesting that synchrotron self - absorption is responsible for the flat spectra and arguing against a thermal origin @xcite .",
    "thus , it is very likely that at least 50% of the liners and low - luminosity seyferts in our sample contain accretion - powered nuclei .",
    "several independent factors , described in section 3.5 , support our proposition that the presence of a compact , flat - spectrum ( as determined from vla observations ) radio core is related to the presence of accretion onto a massive black hole in llagns .",
    "the detection rate of radio cores in transition objects in our sample is dramatically low ( 1 of 18 ) .",
    "the significant difference between transition and `` pure '' liner detection rates , combined with the lack of any significant difference between their host galaxy properties , suggests one of the following .",
    "1 ) the central engines of transition objects are intrinsically different from those of `` pure '' liners , or 2 ) transition objects are truly composite nuclei with a liner and an h  ii component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case both the liner component and its radio emission are much weaker in transition objects than in `` pure '' liners . using the luminosity in the [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 line as an indicator of the luminosity of the liner component ,",
    "this second premise is supported by the results that the [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 and 2  cm luminosities are correlated at the @xmath1597% significance level , and that the [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosity of the transition objects is lower than that of the liners and seyferts in the sample at the @xmath1599.8% significance level ( fig .  2 ) .    finally , if the extended 20  cm radio emission , which appears preferentially aligned with the host galaxy minor axis in a subset of 2  cm compact core llagns ( fig .",
    "3 ) , does trace jets from the central engine , there are interesting implications for the orientation of the central engines of agn",
    ". similar analyses of `` classical '' seyferts @xcite have shown that the distribution of p.a.@xmath37 ",
    "p.a.@xmath38 is more or less uniform between 0 and 90 .",
    "one explanation for this uniform distribution is that radiation from the central engine illuminates the inner accretion disk inducing a `` radiative instability '' @xcite which causes large warps in the inner disk . in this case",
    ", even if the outer accretion disk shares the same axis of rotation as the host galaxy disk , the jet ( presumably launched along the axis of the inner accretion disk ) may then be at a random angle with respect to the axis of the galaxy disk .",
    "if the radiation instability is indeed the correct explanation , then in llagns , where the radiation field of the central engine is much weaker , the disk is expected to be less prone to the radiation instability ( see e.g. equation 3.2 and section 3.2 of pringle 1997 ) , so that the jet axis is more likely to be along the host galaxy rotation axis .",
    "this is precisely what we find .",
    "alternately , the jet power in llagns may be low enough that buoyancy dominates jet motions on the scale ( typically 50350  pc ) of the extended emission , redirecting the jet along the minor axis .",
    "our further surveys for 2  cm radio cores in llagns and our completed observations of 17 nearby bright llagns at 03 resolution with the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) at 20  cm will potentially reveal more on this subject .",
    "our detection of compact , flat - spectrum radio cores in about 50% of low - luminosity seyferts and liners in a sample of 48 low - luminosity agns , when combined with vlba observations @xcite , suggests that at least half of all low - luminosity seyferts and liners are accretion powered .",
    "given the sensitivity limit of our survey , the true incidence of radio cores is likely to be higher .",
    "the 2  cm radio power is significantly correlated with the [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosity for llagns in our sample . the lower detection rate ( at @xmath492% significance ) of compact radio cores in `` transition '' nuclei suggests that either these nuclei are intrinsically different from `` pure '' liners , or their `` pure '' liner component is of lower luminosity , with correspondingly lower luminosity radio cores .",
    "the latter interpretation is favored by the correlation between the radio and [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities coupled with the lower [ o  i ]  @xmath06300 luminosities of the `` transition '' nuclei as compared to the liners .",
    "the presence or absence of a detected broad h@xmath9 line is not a good indicator of the presence or absence of a compact , flat - spectrum 2  cm radio core .",
    "a significant number of the liners and low - luminosity seyferts which contain 2  cm compact radio cores show evidence , at low resolution ( 15 ) and frequency ( 1.4  ghz or 20  cm ) , for extended radio emission along the galaxy disk minor axis .",
    "this radio emission may trace a wide - angle outflow or a weak , highly - collimated jet along the disk rotation axis .",
    "if the latter is true , it lends support to the idea that it is the `` radiative instability '' which causes warps in the nuclear accretion disks of more luminous seyfert galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that the data presented here are the initial results of a larger program to study a well - defined sample of llagns at high resolution with the vla and vlba ; results of these will appear in future papers in this series .",

    "the galaxy is diffuse , @xmath15 12 x 10 in extent , and has a prominent dust lane to the north - west which may bias the optical position determination . overlaying the optical and radio images shows that the 2  cm radio source lies at the south - west tip of the dust lane , and the offset from the optical center does appear to be more than can be explained by dust lane obscuration .",
