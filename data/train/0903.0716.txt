    "the physical mechanism of pulsar radio emission remains still poorly understood .",
    "observational evidence ( e.g. kramer , wex & wielebinski  2000 ) suggests that it must be due to some coherent radiation mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , neither the exact mechanism ( curvature radiation , free electron maser emission , excited plasma waves , etc . ) , nor its origin ( inner or outer magnetosphere ) are clear .",
    "it is nevertheless widely accepted that radio emission originates within a few stellar radii from the stellar surface , and is due to relativistic plasma outflowing from the two stellar magnetic poles ( e.g. kramer _",
    "et al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we here would like to propose a new physical picture for pulsar radio emission that capitalizes on what we have learned about the pulsar magnetosphere when studied under the assumption of force - free ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the first self - consistent solution of the axisymmetric problem ( contopoulos , kazanas & fendt  1999 , hereafter ckf ) demonstrated that the pulsar magnetosphere consists of a closed line corotating region ( the so called ` dead zone ' ) that extends up to the ` light cylinder ' at distances @xmath3 from the rotation axis ( @xmath4 is the angular velocity and @xmath5 the period of the rotating neutron star ) , and two open line regions that originate around the two stellar magnetic poles ( the so called ` polar caps ' ) . from each polar",
    "cap outflows the main magnetospheric current , which in the case of the aligned rotator may be estimated as @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the stellar polar magnetic field and radius respectively ( gruzinov  2004 ; contopoulos  2005 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 sign in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) depends on whether the magnetic axis is aligned or counter - aligned with the axis of rotation ( our results will heretofore refer to the aligned case with the corresponding result for the counter - aligned case in parentheses ) .",
    "ckf established that the return electric current flows along the separatrix between open and closed field lines .",
    "in fact , they self - consistently determined the distribution of electric current as well as the distribution of electric space - charge everywhere in the magnetosphere .",
    "we would like to point out here that magnetohydrodynamics does not deal with the issue of how this is materialized with actual distributions and flows of charged particles ( electrons and positrons ) .",
    "this is not really a problem for the largest part of the magnetosphere since it is known that the number density of the electron - positron plasma that fills the magnetosphere exceeds the above space - charge by a huge multiplicity factor ( on the order of @xmath10 ; e.g. arons  1983 ) , and all that is needed in order to obtain the distributions required by ckf is a _",
    "slight difference in the velocities of electrons and positrons_. as we will now argue , this may not be true in the separatrix between open and closed field lines .",
    "we will discuss here only the axisymmetic case ( we plan to address the 3d problem in paper  ii of this series based on the numerical results of kalapotharakos & contopoulos  2009 ) .",
    "inside the closed line region , @xmath11 , and particles at its tip corotate with lorentz factor @xmath12 equal to @xmath13 where , @xmath14 is the ( cylindrical ) distance from the rotation axis .",
    "let us heretofore denote quantities at the inner / outer surface of the separatrix with @xmath9 indices respectively .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field @xmath15 , and @xmath16 uzdensky  ( 2003 ) and others pointed out that , as the tip of the dead zone approaches the light cylinder , the poloidal magnetic field @xmath17 diverges as @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the lorenz invariant @xmath20 is continuous across the separatrix , and @xmath21 ; see ffig .  1 ; see also fig .  4 of kalapotharakos & contopoulos  2009 , fig .",
    "11 of timokhin  2006 , and fig .  1 of spitkovsky  2006 ) .",
    "note that particles at the tip of the dead zone corotate with the star due to the combined action of the magnetospheric electric and magnetic fields . during that motion ,",
    "they deviate around their corotation radius within distances on the order of the gyroradius @xmath22 here , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the electron mass and charge respectively , and @xmath25 is the gyration frequency . for a ` cold ' particle distribution , _",
    "this distance dictates also the thickness of the separatrix layer_. we will assume that the closed line region extends as close to the light cylinder as is allowed by the equations of motion , namely that @xmath26 eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) & ( [ d2 ] ) yield @xmath27    one interesting feature of the separatrix is that it is negatively ( positively ) charged with surface charge density @xmath28 we can express the number density @xmath29 of charge carriers in the separatrix layer as @xmath30 obviously , _ the multiplicity factor @xmath31 must be on the order of unity for the force - free assumption to be valid_. note that at the tip of the dead zone , the goldreich - julian number density @xmath32 is equal to @xmath33 } \\approx \\frac{b_p^-}{4\\pi e d}=\\frac{(b_p^-)^2}{4\\pi\\gamma m_e c^2}\\label{ngj}\\ ] ] ( goldreich & julian  1969 , ckf ) , and therefore , @xmath34 we have shown here that the number density of charge carriers at the tip of the separatrix must be close to the minimum number density needed to support the surface charge density required by eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "these particles corotate with the star at speeds very close to the speed of light . if we now apply ampre s law @xmath35 and if we assume that particles at the tip of the separatrix move with velocities @xmath36 , then eqs .  ( [ bs ] ) & ( [ bphi ] ) imply that @xmath37 note that the separatrix is negatively ( positively ) charged , and therefore , @xmath38 points along the direction of stellar rotation and towards the star .",
    "in other words , _ electrons ( positrons ) in the separatrix follow a spiral motion as they move inwards away from the tip of the closed line region , with very small pitch angles on the order of @xmath39 _ ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "ckf ( and for that matter all subsequent investigations ) failed to emphasize the significance of this annular ( i.e. azimuthal ) electric current .",
    "these electrons / positrons emit incoherent synchrotron radiation up to a cutoff frequency @xmath40 which corresponds to hard x - rays .",
    "we emphasize once again that this incoherent synchrotron radiation is due to the macroscopic corotating motion of the separatrix electrons ( positrons ) around the light cylinder .",
    "we would like to name this configuration _ ` the pulsar synchrotron'_.",
    "what remains to be calculated is the total power radiated from such an electron ( positron ) configuration .",
    "the power radiated by an individual particle is equal to @xmath41 with a frequency distribution ( in erg / s / hz ) @xmath42 at low frequencies @xmath43 ( jackson  1975 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , the annular volume where radiating electrons / positrons attain their maximum lorentz factor given by eq .  ( [ gamma ] ) has thickness and height comparable to @xmath44 , and contains @xmath45 particles .",
    "the total incoherent power emitted by these particles is probably too low to be observable .",
    "as we will now argue , however , coherency effects may become very important in the radio frequency range around 100  mhz .",
    "it is well known that , in laboratory synchrotrons , particles travel in bunches with macroscopic dimensions ( @xmath46 mm ) along their direction of motion , where the bunch length @xmath47 is determined by the geometrical and operational characteristics of the synchrotron .",
    "it has been observed that , _ at wavelengths comparable to the bunch length ( or the length of any structure in the bunch ) , the radiation from multiple particles is in phase _ , giving a radiated power proportional to @xmath1 times the power radiated by an individual particle , where @xmath2 is the bunch population ( e.g. venturin _ et al . _",
    "this emission is orders of magnitude stronger than the incoherent power at those wavelengths , which is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "a practical application of this effect is the generation of thz coherent synchrotron radiation in synchrotrons with x - ray incoherent synchrotron radiation ( e.g. sannibale _ et al . _  2003 ) .",
    "the pulsar synchrotron is certainly very different from an earth synchrotron .",
    "nevertheless , we may also obtain a characteristic bunch length @xmath47 in the pulsar synchrotron as follows : separatrix electrons / positrons stay in the annular volume of maximum lorentz factor at the tip of the dead zone for a path - length on the order of @xmath48 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "if indeed particles emit coherently at the above characteristic wavelength during the time they need to cross the region of maximum lorentz factor , the coherent radiation corresponds to about 100  mhz .",
    "the annular radiating volume consists of @xmath49 regions of length @xmath47 , each one consisting of @xmath50 particles .",
    "the total luminosity of the coherent emission in a frequency range on the order of @xmath51 may be estimated as the sum of the luminosities of the @xmath52 coherently emitting regions @xmath53 ( the factor of 2 accounts for the contribution to the total radio luminosity from both hemispheres of the dead zone separatrix ) .",
    "this is just an order of magnitude calculation of the coherent radio luminosity expected from the tip of the dead zone .",
    "more detailed analysis will require the 3d numerical self - consistent reconstruction of the electric and magnetic field geometry near the tip of the dead zone together with the calculation of separatrix particle orbits ( work in progress ) .",
    "nevertheless , our estimate of the coherent radiation frequency is not far from the observed peak of pulsar radio emission at a few hundred mhz .",
    "moreover , as we can see in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , our result in eq .  ( [ l ] ) is consistent with estimates of the total pulsar radio luminosity obtained from the atnf pulsar catalogue times the average brightness , where @xmath54 is the observed pulse width .",
    "the total radio luminosity is then calculated in the context of the pulsar synchrotron model in which radiation is emitted within @xmath55 radians above and below the equator .",
    "this is very different from the canonical model where radio emission is produced in two beams originating in the polar caps . ]",
    "( manchester _ et al . _",
    "we therefore believe that our scenario merits serious consideration as an alternative to the radio pulsar phenomenon .",
    "the scenario that pulsar radio emission may be coming from the light cylinder is not new . in the early days of pulsar astronomy",
    ", people discussed the possibility that radio pulses may be due to hot plasma corotating at discrete positions on the light cylinder ( e.g. gold  1968 , 1969 ; bartel  1978 ; cordes  1981 ; ferguson  1981 ) .",
    "these models have since been abandoned .",
    "our present model is different in several respects ( our plasma is cold in its rest frame , the fundamental synchrotron radiation frequency is the neutron star rotation frequency , pulses are due to the 3d structure of the magnetosphere , etc . ) .",
    "we would like to conclude this presentation with two final points of interest .",
    "the first has to do with one of the few robust facts about pulsar radio emission , namely the characteristic s - curve polarization sweeps . in order for our model to survive as a valid alternative to highly successful phenomenological models such as the rotating vector model of radhakrishnan & cooke  ( 1969 )",
    ", it has to be able to explain this fact .",
    "this analysis requires knowledge of the 3d structure of the pulsar magnetosphere obtained only recently by spitkovsky  ( 2006 ) and kalapotharakos & contopoulos  ( 2009 ) .",
    "let us , however , present here some preliminary results , and let us introduce the three basic angles of the 3d problem , namely the angle @xmath56 between the rotation axis and the stellar magnetic moment , the angle @xmath57 between the observer line of sight and the rotation axis , and the observed polarization angle @xmath58 with @xmath59 along the rotation equatorial plane .",
    "let us also introduce the angle @xmath60 between the rotation equatorial plane and the direction connecting the central star with the instantaneous position of the tip of the dead zone on the light cylinder .",
    "in the context of our present pulsar synchrotron model , radiation is observed whenever the instantaneous direction of the annular current at the tip of the dead zone happens to lie close to our line of sight .",
    "the instantaneous direction of polarization @xmath58 lies along the direction of the instantaneous radius of curvature which , we argue , must be close to @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 $ ] . in fig .",
    "( 4 ) we show the variation of @xmath60 with pulsar longitude as obtained in the solution of kalapotharakos & contopoulos  ( 2009 ) for inclination @xmath62 .",
    "we also plot the resulting polarization sweep for an observer inclination @xmath63 .",
    "this preliminary result is promising enough to justify the continuation of our effort in paper  ii of this series .",
    "the second point of interest has to do with the equatorial return current sheet beyond the light cylinder .",
    "one can directly check that this is positively ( negatively ) charged , that is with a surface charge _",
    "opposite _ to that of the separatrix current sheet inside the light cylinder . and",
    "yet , the electric current in both current sheets flows in the same direction , that is towards ( away from ) the star .",
    "given the limitation on the available number density of charge carriers imposed by the force - free approximation ( see discussion in ",
    "2 ) , in order to supply the inward flowing electrons ( positrons ) and the outward flowing positrons ( electrons ) , we need a source of pairs at the tip of the separatrix at the position of the light cylinder .",
    "this may either be supplied as a steady stream of pairs along the separatrix from the surface of the star , or through pair creation by some yet to be determined process at that position .",
    "note that as these particles move away from the tip of the dead zone , they either move along the equator in a trajectory which becomes asymptotically radial ( i.e. with a radius of curvature much larger than @xmath64 ) , or they move inwards where the corotation lorentz factor becomes smaller and smaller . in both cases , their contribution to the total synchrotron radiation energy content is expected to be much smaller than the radiation they emit as they traverse the annular volume of thickness @xmath44 just inside the light cylinder that we discussed in the previous section .",
