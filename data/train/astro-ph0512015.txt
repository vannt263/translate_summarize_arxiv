    "the extragalactic gamma - ray sky is still poorly explored with only a few surveys having been performed so far above 10 kev : the all - sky survey conducted in the 1980 s by the heao / a4 instrument in the 13 - 80 kev band ( levine et al .",
    "1984 ) and more recently those of rxte / pca and swift / bat , in the 8 - 20 and 14 - 195 kev bands respectively ( revnivtsev et al . 2004 , markwardt et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the latter , characterized by a positional uncertainty of @xmath53 and a flux detection limit of @xmath010@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , is the most accurate and sensitive survey to date at high energies .",
    "it covers the high latitude sky providing a sample of 44 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , most of which are previously known from x - ray studies .",
    "despite being so rare , gamma - ray surveys are an efficient way to find agn as they probe heavily obscured regions / objects , i.e. those that could be missed in optical , uv , and even x - ray surveys .",
    "indeed , 64% of the non - blazar sources found by swift / bat have absorption in excess of 10@xmath6 atoms @xmath3 and the overall column density distribution is bimodal .",
    "while none of the sources brighter than 3@xmath110@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 shows high column densities , almost all weaker objects are absorbed .",
    "quantifying the fraction of agn missed by low energy surveys is necessary if we want to provide input parameters for synthesis models of the x - ray background and to understand the accretion history of the universe .",
    "a further step in this field is provided by the imager ( ibis ) on board integral , which , like bat , is surveying a large fraction of the sky above 20 kev with similar sensitivity and positional accuracy .",
    "analysis of the first year of integral observations covering largely the galactic plane and centre has provided a first sample of 10 gamma - ray selected agn ( bassani et al .",
    "2004 ) ; more recently the second ibis survey has listed 32 such objects ( bird et al . 2005 ) .",
    "detailed analysis of integral observations also suggests that agn are becoming a major constituent of the ibis source population ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2005 , beckmann et al . 2005 ) ; at least 15% of the objects in the second ibis catalogue are active galaxies . here , we present a further step in our all - sky survey project , limiting the search to extragalactic objects .",
    "we have analysed @xmath011300 integral pointings and detected 62 agn in the 20 - 100 kev energy range .",
    "data reported here belong to the core program and public open time observations and span from revolution 46 ( february 2003 ) to revolution 309 ( april 2005 ) inclusive ; this represents a significant extension both in exposure time and area coverage with respect to the second ibis catalogue ( bird et al .",
    "2005 ) with more than 4000 extra pointings being analysed . a detailed description of the data analysis and source extraction criteria can be found in the above reference , the only difference being the use of an updated version ( 4.2 ) of the standard osa software .    to search for agn",
    "we have used the 20 - 100 kev flux map , which provides a good combination between significance of detection and overall background level over the mosaic = 1.9 and a break around 100 kev ( malizia et al .",
    "2003 ) and the energy band was selected to match these spectral characteristics . the threshold significance level used for the source extraction was 5@xmath8 .    staring data , which tend to be much noisier than dithering observations , as well as early exposures performed while the instrument set - up was still being finalized , were not included in the present mosaic ; also sources detected only occasionally , e.g. in one or two revolutions only , are not considered in the present sample although they may be associated to flaring agn such as blazars .",
    "due to the different database used , our catalogue results may not include some sources already reported in the literature ( e.g. beckmann et al . 2005 ) .",
    "for each excess , the flux extracted from the 20 - 100 kev light curve was then used to estimate the source strength ( up to 6% in flux can be lost in the mosaicing process ) and independently confirm the image detection .",
    "once a list of reliable excesses was produced , we proceeded to identify them by cross checking the ibis error boxes ( assumed to be 3as default ) with the simbad , ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) and heasarc ( high energy astrophysics science archive research center ) databases .",
    "of all the excesses found in this survey , we report in table 1 only those which can be confidently associated with agn . while some of the other detections may also be active galaxies , due to their location near the galactic plane it is difficult to discriminate them from galactic objects without further observations .",
    "the 62 sources listed in the table are divided into two sections : ( a ) 32 objects already reported as confirmed or candidate active galaxies in the 2@xmath9 ibis catalogue ( all but one of the candidates have subsequently been confirmed as agn through follow up optical spectroscopy ( masetti et al . 2005a , b ) ) and ( b ) 30 new objects , including four which were classified as unidentified in the 2@xmath9 ibis survey but which we now consider to be agn candidates .",
    "between both sets there are 14 sources which have not yet any optical classification , but their extragalactic nature is strongly indicated either by follow up chandra observations ( igr j07565 - 4129 , igr j12026 - 5349 and igr j17204 - 3554 ) , by their high latitude location ( igr j13000 + 2529 , igr j13057 + 2036 , igr j16194 - 2810 and igr j18429 - 3243 ) or by multiwaveband analysis using radio , infrared and x - ray archival data whereby their optical counterpart has been found to be associated with a galaxy ( igr j07597 - 3842 , igr j14552 - 5133 , igr j14492 - 5535 , igr j16558 - 5293,igr j20187 + 4041 , igr j20286 + 2544 and igr j21178 + 5139 ) .    in the table",
    ", we list the relevant ibis parameters ( position , exposure and flux in mcrab ) together with ( where available ) the optical classification and redshift obtained from ned archive or from more recent publications as detailed in the table . between 20 - 100 kev ,",
    "1 mcrab corresponds , for a crab like spectrum , to 1.6@xmath110@xmath2 erg @xmath3s@xmath4 which is a value close to our detection limit . for objects with known distance",
    ", fluxes have been converted to gamma - ray luminosities assuming h@xmath10=71 km sec@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath10=0 ( spergel et al .",
    "available column densities are also listed and have been obtained from x - ray data in the literature or in public databases . unfortunately a significant fraction ( about 30% ) of our objects do not have archival x - ray spectra , so that an estimate of the column density must await x - ray follow up observations .",
    "the quoted column densities are intrinsic to the source , except for those cases where n@xmath11 is comparable to the galactic absorption , in which case the quoted values are upper limits .",
    "about 40% of the objects listed in table 1 are well known gamma - ray emitters and have been studied in the ibis energy range by previous missions such as bepposax , osse and rxte ; comparison of our data with past observations indicates overall agreement ( within a factor of a few ) on the flux ( soldi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the remaining objects are detected above 10 kev for the first time ; many of these were not even known to be active nor to be x - ray sources before their integral discovery ( sazonov et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is largely due to their location in the galactic plane which has prevented an in - depth study of these objects up to now .",
    "a comparison of the ibis catalogue with the swift sample indicates that the intersection is very small ( only 9 sources ) , due to bat observing mostly the high galactic latitude sky while ibis maps preferentially the galactic plane .",
    "it is likely that , together , these two surveys will provide a complete and deep sky coverage and thus the best yet sample of gamma - ray selected agn for some time to come .",
    "it must be remembered that the present survey is highly inhomogeneous in sky exposure and coverage , thus the present sample is far from being complete .",
    "nevertheless a few interesting considerations can be drawn by a simple statistical analysis . for objects with known distance , we plot in figure 1 the gamma - ray luminosity against redshift , to show the large range in these parameters sampled by the present survey . from this figure",
    "it is also evident that our sensitivity limit is around 1.5@xmath110@xmath2 erg @xmath3s@xmath4 ( straight line in the figure ) .    within the overall sample ,",
    "42 objects are classified as seyfert galaxies , 6 are blazars and 14 are still unclassified . within the sample of seyfert galaxies , 23 objects",
    "are of type 1 - 1.5 while 19 are of type 2 thus illustrating the power of gamma - ray surveys to find narrow line agn . excluding the blazars , the average redshift of our sample is 0.021@xmath120.017 ( 1@xmath8 ) while the mean luminosity in log is 43.45@xmath120.71 . assuming 10@xmath6 atoms",
    "@xmath3 to be the dividing line between absorbed and unabsorbed sources , we find that absorption is present in 65@xmath1217% of the sample .",
    "this result is in line with the swift findings ( markwardt et al .",
    "2005 ) and above that found in x - ray surveys for bright objects ( la franca et al .",
    "2005 , comastri 2004 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that 14@xmath127% of the total sample is due to compton thick objects which is about three times the frequency found by swift .    in figure 2",
    "we show the column density of the sources as a function of ibis luminosity .",
    "although from this figure there is little evidence of any strong correlation , the few high luminosity objects in the survey all have low absorption .",
    "we can further investigate the relationship between n@xmath11 and log(l ) by forming the ratio between the fraction of absorbed sources above a given luminosity and that below this value .",
    "it can be seen from figure 3 that below log(l)@xmath043.5 the ratio is practically constant while above this luminosity it decreases sharply implying that at high ibis luminosities there are very few absorbed sources .",
    "this is in agreement with that found by the swift / bat team and obtained from 2 - 10 kev studies ( la franca et al .",
    "2005 ) .    within the sub - sample of 17 seyfert 2s with known n@xmath11 , we find that all are absorbed and almost 30% are compton thick ; this is in line with previous estimates of the column density distribution of type 2 objects based on x - ray data ( risaliti et al .",
    "1999 , bassani et al .",
    "interestingly we also find that 33% of type 1 objects are absorbed .",
    "more in depth studies of the present sample require optical classification of all objects and a detailed analysis of their broad band behaviour ( particularly in the x - ray to gamma - ray band ) in order to understand the role of absorption and the relation of extragalactic gamma - ray surveys to those in other wavebands .",
    "in the meantime this catalogue testifies to the power of integral / ibis to probe the extragalactic gamma - ray sky , discover new active galaxies and find absorbed objects .",
    "this research has been supported by asi under contract i / r/046/04 .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from ned ( jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology ) , simbad ( cds , strasbourg , france ) and heasarc ( nasa s goddard space flight center ) .",
