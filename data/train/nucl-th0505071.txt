    "since the pioneering work of brink and vautherin @xcite , continuous efforts have been made to readjust the parameters of the skyrme type effective nucleon - nucleon interaction to better reproduce experimental data .",
    "most of the parameters of the skyrme interactions available in the literature were obtained by fitting the hartree - fock ( hf ) results to experimental data on bulk properties of a few stable closed shell nuclei . only recently ,",
    "several families of the skyrme parameters e.g. , ski1 - 6 , sly1 - 10 , skx and sko @xcite were obtained by fitting hf results to the experimental data on the bulk properties of nuclei ranging from the @xmath12stable nuclei to those near the proton and/or neutron drip lines . in the skx interaction , to yield appropriately the values for the binding energy differences between mirror nuclei also referred to as the coulomb displacement energy ( cde ) , the contribution of the coulomb exchange term in the hf equations is ignored and the direct coulomb term is evaluated by replacing the point proton distribution by its charge distribution .",
    "however , it has been further shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the skx interaction is not suitable for studying the properties of neutron stars . since",
    ", for the skx interaction , the quantity @xmath13 which is directly related to the slope of the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath6 , becomes negative for nuclear matter densities @xmath14 well below @xmath7 ( @xmath15 @xmath16 is the saturation density ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ski1 - 6 , sly1 - 10 and sko skyrme interactions are found to be suitable for the study of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "but , these families of skyrme interactions significantly underestimate the values of the cde for mirror nuclei , since the coulomb exchange term was included .",
    "thus , it is desirable to have a unified interaction which includes the merits of several families of the skyrme interactions as mentioned above .",
    "one can further enhance the applicability of the skyrme type effective nucleon - nucleon interaction by imposing certain constraints as discussed below .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "we implement , for the first time , the simulated annealing method ( sam ) @xcite to fit the values of the skyrme parameters and develop a more realistic skyrme type effective interaction .",
    "the sam is an elegant technique for optimization problems of large scale , in particular , where a desired global extremum is hidden among many local extrema .",
    "this method has been found to be an extremely useful tool for a wide variety of minimization problems of large non - linear systems in many different areas of science ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . very recently",
    "@xcite , the sam was used to generate some initial trial parameter sets for the point coupling variant of the relativistic mean field model . in the present context",
    ", we use the sam to determine the values of the skyrme parameters by searching for the global minimum in the hyper - surface of the @xmath17 function given as , @xmath18 where , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number of experimental data points and the number of fitted parameters , respectively , @xmath21 is the theoretical error and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the experimental and the corresponding theoretical values , respectively , for a given observable .",
    "the values of @xmath24 depends on the skyrme parameters , since , the @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) is calculated using the hf approach with a skyrme type effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .    toward the purpose of obtaining a more realistic parameterization of the skyrme interaction ,",
    "we apply the sam to fit the hf results to an extensive set of experimental data for the binding energy , charge radii , spin - orbit splitting and root mean square ( rms ) radii of valence neutron orbits .",
    "our data set used in the fit consists of 14 spherical nuclei , namely , @xmath25o , @xmath26o , @xmath27si , @xmath28ca , @xmath29ca , @xmath29ni , @xmath30ni , @xmath31ni , @xmath32ni , @xmath33sr , @xmath34zr , @xmath35sn , @xmath36sn and @xmath37pb .",
    "we also include in our fit the experimental data for the breathing mode energies for the @xmath34zr , @xmath38sn , @xmath39sm and @xmath37pb nuclei .",
    "in addition , we include in the fit , the critical density @xmath4 which is determined from the stability conditions for the landau parameters .",
    "we further constrain the values of the skyrme parameters by requiring that ( i ) the quantity @xmath40 must be positive for densities up to @xmath41 ; a condition imposed by neutron star models @xcite , ( ii ) the enhancement factor @xmath8 , associated with the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule for the isovector giant dipole resonance , lies in the range of @xmath9 @xcite and ( iii ) the landau parameter @xmath10 , crucial for the spin properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter , should be positive at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we also provide simple but consistent schemes to account appropriately for the cde and the center of mass corrections to the binding energy and charge radii . in order to check the reliability of the proposed skyrme interactions for the study of high density matter",

    "note , in particular , that the direct term of eq .",
    "( [ hdir ] ) is proportional to @xmath78 and not to @xmath79 , as it should be for a direct term , see a detailed discussion in ref .",
    "we point out that for the cde of mirror nuclei the magnitude of the self interaction term is cde/(2@xmath80 ) , i.e. , one has a spurious increase in the calculated cde of about 6.3% and 2.5% for the a=17 and 41 systems of mirror nuclei , respectively .",
    "we recall that within the mean - field approximation , adjusted to reproduce the experimental values of the charge rms radii , the calculated cde of analog states ( obtained using eq .",
    "( [ hcoul ] ) ) are smaller than the corresponding experimental values by about 7% . it was first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this discrepancy , also known as the nolen - schiffer anomaly @xcite , can be explained by taking into account the contributions due to long range correlations ( lrc ) and due to the charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the nn interaction , see also ref .",
    "we add that for the mirror nuclei with a=17 and a=41 , the lrc and the csb each accounts for about half of the discrepancy between theory and experiment . also , the magnitude of the bona fide exchange coulomb term is about the same as that due to lrc , but with opposite sign .",
    "therefore , neglecting the bona fide coulomb exchange term does not resolved the discrepancy between theory and experiment , but can account for the contribution of lrc .",
    "we add that in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that by ignoring the coulomb exchange term in the form of of eq .",

    "( 12 ) , i.e. , by including only the coulomb direct term in the form of eq .",
    "( 13 ) ( as is the case for the skx interaction ) , one reproduces the experimental values of the cde .",
    "it should be clear that this is due to the fact that by adopting the form of eq .",
    "( 13 ) for the coulomb direct term one not only neglects the bona fide coulomb exchange term , but also adds the spurious contribution of the self - interaction term . the unphysical neglect of the bona fide coulomb exchange term together with the spurious contribution of the self - interaction term results in a contribution to cde which is similar in magnitude to that obtained from the lrc + csb terms . for simplicity",
    ", we will adopt in this work the form of eq .",
    "( 13 ) for the coulomb direct term .",
    "the hf approach applied to finite nuclei violates the translational invariance , introducing a spurious center of mass ( cm ) motion .",
    "thus , one must extract the contributions of the center of mass motion to the binding energy b , radii and other observables . an accurate way to restore",
    "the translational invariance is to use the projection method .",
    "but , it is numerically very expensive .",
    "so , it is desirable to develop simple schemes for the cm corrections to various observables",
    ". normally , one makes the cm corrections only to the binding energy and not to the radii .",
    "however , the cm corrections to the rms radii for light nuclei may be as large as @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "in the present work we shall consider the cm corrections to the binding energy as well as charge rms radii used to fit the skyrme parameters .    to account for the cm correction to the total binding energy , one must subtract from it the so - called cm energy given as , @xmath82 where , @xmath83 is the total linear momentum operator .",
    "traditionally , one simplifies the computation of eq .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) by taking into account only the one - body parts of it , which can be easily achieved by replacing @xmath84,$ ] in the kinetic energy term . in this case , the effects of neglecting the two - body part of eq .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) are compensated by renormalization of the force parameters .",
    "this may induce in the forces an incorrect trend with respect to @xmath85 which becomes visible in the nuclear matter properties .",
    "in fact , it is found in ref .",
    "@xcite that an over simplified treatment of @xmath86 obtained by renormalizing the nucleon mass appearing in the kinetic energy term leads to a larger value of the surface energy coefficient than those obtained using the full cm correction .",
    "this gives rise to differences in the deformation energy which becomes quite pronounced for the super deformed states .",
    "very recently @xcite , we also find that a large value of the surface energy coefficient yield a smaller value for the critical density .",
    "thus , an appropriate and still simple scheme to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) is highly desirable .",
    "we note , however , that the sly6 , sly7 and sly10 interactions @xcite have been obtained by evaluating eq .",

    "( [ ecm ] ) is given by , @xmath87 a value of @xmath88 mev is used in many relativistic mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "an improved version for the cm correction can be obtained by modifying the oscillator frequency as @xmath89 mev , which has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the skx interaction . here",

    "we emphasize that this scheme is quite reliable even for the nuclei away from the @xmath94-stable line where the values of the rms radii deviate from the @xmath95 law .",
    "we have calculated the total binding energy for the sly7 interaction using our simple scheme for the cm correction , eq .",
    "( [ hw ] ) , and compare them with those given in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained by using one - body and two - body parts of the eq .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) .",

    "skyrme interactions only contain monopolar and dipolar contributions to the particle - hole interaction so that all landau parameters are zero for @xmath113 .",

    "( [ tk ] ) , yields reasonable values for the best fit parameters . to validate the present approach we carried out the following checks . starting with the final values of the skyrme parameters",

    "the value of @xmath212 is obtained by averaging over all the successful reconfigurations for a given @xmath181 .",

    "we see from table [ in3 ] that , except for the @xmath25o and @xmath29ca nuclei , the deviations in the values of the charge rms radii for the kde0 interaction is less than 0.5% .",

    "we would also like to add that the said difference for the skx interaction is 66.3 mev which is about 1.0 mev lower than our most realistic kde0 interaction . on the other hand , most of the skyrme interactions which include the contribution from the exchange coulomb term yield @xmath223 mev , which is about 6 mev lower than the corresponding experimental value .",

    "all of these interactions are quite suitable for modeling the neutron star with masses close to the canonical one @xcite , because , they yield @xmath228 for @xmath229 . in fig .",
    "[ eos_neu ] we plot the eos for the pure neutron matter resulting from the kde0 and kde interactions and compare them with the ones obtained for sly7 interaction and the realistic uv14+uvii model @xcite .",

    "we have carried out two different fits named as kde0 and kde , as described in sec .",
    "the corrections to the binding energy and charge rms radii due to the center of mass motion were performed using simple but consistent schemes .",
    "the nuclear matter properties for both interactions proposed in the present work are obtained directly from the fit .",

    "this selection was done using a uniform random number .",
    "however , one can think of performing random selection of a component of @xmath166 by assigning a more plausible weight factors to these components .",
    "one can also try out different annealing schedules to determine the rate of cooling . in the present work we employed the cauchy annealing schedule which yields a faster cooling rate than that of the boltzmann schedule , but , a slower rate than the exponential annealing schedule .",
    "the effects on the binding energy and radii due to the correlations beyond mean - field @xcite can be included in the fit .",
