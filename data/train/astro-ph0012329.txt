    "a shock wave is termed nonradiative if the cooling time of the postshock gas exceeds the dynamical time scale .",
    "nonradiative shocks lack cooling zones , therefore the optical and ultraviolet line emission is excited close to the shock front .",
    "the emission line fluxes and line widths are sensitive to the shock velocity and the degree of postshock electron - ion / ion - ion equilibration .",
    "this property makes the optical and ultraviolet lines valuable tools for investigating collisionless heating in high mach number , low density shock waves .    for an ion of mass @xmath4 , the jump conditions for a strong shock in an ideal gas medium ( @xmath5 ) give a postshock temperature @xmath6 in an unequilibrated shock , the electron and proton temperatures are in the ratio 1/2000:1 , while the temperatures of o ions and protons are in the ratio of 16:1 . in contrast , the temperatures of all three species are equal in an equilibrated shock .",
    "collisionless heating can produce equilibrations anywhere between these two extremes . in principle , the amount of collisionless heating from plasma waves , mhd turbulence and other processes is sensitive to such parameters as the magnetosonic mach number and angle between the magnetic field and shock front .",
    "understanding this relationship is of critical importance in the interpretation of x - ray , ultraviolet and optical data of high mach number collisionless shocks .",
    "a nonradiative shock in partially neutral gas emits a pure balmer line spectrum generated by collisional excitation .",
    "each balmer line consists of a narrow component produced by excitation of cold h  i and a broad component produced by proton - h  i charge exchange .",
    "the shock velocity and electron - ion equilibration can be gauged from the broad component line width and ratio of broad component to narrow component flux @xcite@xcite .",
    "the ion - ion equilibration can be gauged in turn by measuring the width of the o  vi @xmath21032 , 1038 lines and the variation of o  vi flux with position behind the shock .",
    "the target of our fuse observations was cygnus p7 , a nonradiative shock in the ne corner of the cygnus loop supernova remnant@xcite .",
    "we acquired ultraviolet spectra of cygnus p7 in june 2000 for a total of 64 ks ( all during orbital night ) and four slit positions behind the shock ( fig .",
    "the spectra presented here were acquired through the 4@xmath720@xmath8 medium resolution ( mdrs ) slit .",
    "slit position 1 was centered on the crisp balmer - dominated filament and placed parallel to it ( fig .",
    "1 ) . to observe the intensity variation of o  vi , we centered slits 2 , 3 and 4 at 5@xmath8 , 10@xmath8 and 15@xmath8 behind the shock , respectively .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra of positions 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 appear in fig",
    ". 2 . to minimize the background contribution ,",
    "these spectra were extracted from the lif 1a channel ( one of four available with fuse ) , the detector yielding the highest effective area at @xmath91020  .",
    "the spectral resolution is 0.08 (25 ) , corresponding to filled slit emission .",
    "the 1-d spectra of cygnus p7 ( fig .",
    "2 ) reveal three important features : ( 1 ) the o  vi lines are considerably broader than the airglow lines , confirming the detection of o  vi emission in the cygnus p7 shock .",
    "the velocity width of the o  vi @xmath31032 line is @xmath0120 . combining this result with",
    "the shock velocity of 300@xmath1365 predicted from balmer line spectroscopy of cygnus p7 , we obtain @xmath100.7 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the electron - proton equilibration @xmath110.7@xmath11.0 predicted by the balmer line analysis ; in an earlier analysis@xcite of balmer line emission from cygnus p7 , we measured an h@xmath12 broad component width of 262 .",
    "this corresponds to a shock velocity of 265@xmath1365 for cases of no equilibration and full equilibration , respectively .",
    "( 2 ) the o  vi emission lines are strongly affected by absorption .",
    "the absorption features tend to shift blueward at slit positions farther and farther behind the shock .",
    "the variation of o  vi flux with position is masked by the o  vi absorption features ; ( 3 ) the shape of the @xmath31038 absorption profile differs from that of the @xmath31032 profile .",
    "this is mainly due to galactic h@xmath13 absorption at the position of the o  vi @xmath31038 line .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the oberved o  vi absorption : either the bulk of the absorption is produced by interstellar matter ( o  vi , h@xmath13 , c  ii@xmath14 , etc . ) along the line of sight , or the absorption is produced locally by o  vi ions within the shock .",
    "there are three lines of evidence in favor of the latter interpretation :    \\(1 ) the velocity width of the o  vi @xmath31032 absorption feature is @xmath090 , comparable to the width of the @xmath31032 emission line .",
    "the o  vi column density and temperature required to produce the observed absorption are n@xmath152@xmath1610@xmath17 @xmath18 and t@xmath193@xmath1610@xmath20k .",
    "these values are @xmath2110 times larger than the o  vi column density and temperature expected for the ism along the cygnus loop line of sight@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the progressively larger blueshift of the o  vi absorption lines with distance behind the shock can not be explained by interstellar o  vi absorption .",
    "( 3 ) the line center ratio i@xmath22(v=0)/i@xmath23(v=0 ) varies significantly with slit position , from around 0.6 ( position 2 ) to 1.1 ( position 4 ) .",
    "these localized variations are consistent with o  vi resonant scattering within the shock .",
    "the appearance of the o  vi spectrum may be due to a combination of internal resonant scattering and a curved shock geometry .",
    "on the one hand , the o  vi column density and temperature obtained from the fuse spectra are consistent with the range of shock velocities ( 300@xmath1365 from the balmer lines ) and preshock densities ( n@xmath240.1@xmath10.3 @xmath25 from rosat x - ray observations ) estimated for cygnus p7 . on the other hand , a curved shock geometry could explain both the increasing value of i@xmath22(v=0)/i@xmath23(v=0 ) and the increasing absorption blue shift with position behind the shock . in a curved shock , o  vi photons produced farther downstream could be absorbed by o  vi ions on the near ( blue shifted ) side of the shock .",
    "in fuse observations of a nonradiative shock in the ne cygnus loop , we find o  vi emission line widths consistent with moderate to high electron - ion equilibration .",
    "we also find strong o  vi absorption near the centers of the o  vi emission lines . a quantitative explanation of the interplay between the o  vi emission and resonant scattering requires ( 1 ) a careful modeling of the shock geometry , and ( 2 ) a monte carlo simulation to adequately treat resonant scattering at moderate optical depths ( 0@xmath261 ) .",
    "we will address these issues in future work ."
