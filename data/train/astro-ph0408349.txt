    "observing galaxy clustering in deep redshift surveys is one of the most direct way to probe the evolution and structure of our universe itself .",
    "recent advances in observational technologies of deep surveys are spectacular , and enormous amount of information on deep universe must be flooded in near future . to understand the cosmological meaning of galaxy clustering in deep universe , theoretical analysis of the clustering of observed galaxies are necessary .",
    "the observable objects in the deep redshift surveys are fainter than the shallow surveys , and the sampling number density per comoving volume is smaller if we adopt selection criteria by apparent magnitude of galaxies .",
    "when one is interested in linear clustering regime , where complex nonlinear dynamics is not relevant , the mean separation of the objects should be at least of order @xmath3 .",
    "recent advances of redshift surveys , such as the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe survey ( deep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , etc .  can map such fainter objects with sufficient qualities . by an efficient color - selection technique",
    ", the sampling number density can be improved .    the deep redshift surveys , if the sampling density is large enough , have many advantages .",
    "first , the observable volume at deep redshifts is much larger than that at shallow redshifts , simply because the available volume is large in distant space .",
    "second , the nonlinear clustering properties are less important at a fixed scale in deep surveys , because the universe is younger in deep universe and there is less time for the density fields to evolve nonlinearities .",
    "third , while the observations of the nearby universe can map only the snapshot of the recent universe , the observations of the deep universe reveal the evolutionary properties of the universe .",
    "this is an indispensable information to establish a consistent picture of the whole universe .",
    "the measurements of the cosmic microwave background , such as the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite , provide the information of the universe at very high redshift , @xmath4 . on the other hand , the traditional galaxy redshift surveys , such as the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , iras point source catalog redshift survey ( pscz , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the aat two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveal the recent universe , @xmath5 .",
    "systematic investigations of the universe between these redshifts are undoubtedly promising ways to unveil the evolutionary feature of the universe .",
    "especially , the galaxy redshift surveys of redshift range of @xmath6@xmath7 can be attainable by present - day technology .",
    "the kilo - aperture optical spectrograph ( kaos ) project is proposed to survey galaxies at those redshifts with sufficient density , using one of the existing gemini telescopes .",
    "one of the most significant feature of the universe one can probe by such deep redshift surveys is the nature of the dark energy component of the universe .",
    "the dark energy component does not have important contributions at very high redshifts .",
    "the effects of the dark energy can be probed by studying how the recent universe evolves with redshifts .",
    "one of the striking evidence of the dark energy was provided by the luminosity distance ",
    "redshift relation of type ia supernovae @xcite at redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "the galaxy redshift surveys had not been considered to provide constraints on the dark energy , since the galaxy surveys had been restricted to the low - redshift universe at @xmath5 .",
    "the ongoing and future galaxy surveys will break this limitation and the evolutionary features of the universe , including dark energy properties , will be searched by galaxy surveys .",
    "a machinery of probing the dark energy by galaxy surveys is based on the extended alcock - paczyski ( ap ) effects @xcite on galaxy clustering in redshift space .",
    "recently , several authors investigate the feasibility of detecting the nature of the dark energy from the extended ap effects of the correlation function @xcite and the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of the extended ap effect are easier when the power spectrum is used , because the dependences of the observed power spectrum with ap effect on cosmological parameters are not complicated once the dependence on the mass power spectrum is known . including simultaneously the peculiar velocity effect @xcite and the ap effect on the power spectrum requires only simple procedures to implement @xcite .",
    "however , observational determination of the reliable power spectrum requires a homogeneous sample , since the observed spectrum is a convolution of the survey geometry and the real density spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function is more straightforward to observationally determine .",
    "once the selection function of the survey is known , the correlation function is obtained by simple pair countings even when the survey selection is inhomogeneous and the geometrical shape of the survey is complex .",
    "although the theoretical calculation of the two - point correlation function in redshift space is not as obvious as that of the power spectrum , we now have an analytical formula which make a numerical implementation very fast @xcite .",
    "the last formula also contains wide - angle effects of the survey , which can not be naturally implemented in the power spectrum analysis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the two - point correlation function in deep redshift space and its dependence on cosmological parameters .",
    "the cosmological information contained in the correlation function is quantitatively investigated . as a result ,",
    "we provide error forecasts of the cosmological parameters probed by the correlation function in a given redshift survey .",
    "complementarity of samples at different redshifts is quantitatively addressed .",
    "the analysis in this paper provides useful information for the design of the future surveys at deep redshifts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , a compact version of the analytic expression of the correlation function in arbitrarily deep redshift space , derived from a more general expression of the previous work is presented .",
    "physical contents in the analytic formula are addressed in  3 . in  4 ,",
    "series of deep redshift surveys which are within reach of the present - day technology are considered and expected error bounds are estimated by means of the fisher information matrix . optimal designs for the future redshift surveys are indicated .",
    "conclusions and discussion are given in  5 .",

    "useful equations in calculating the fisher matrix with marginalizations are given in appendix  [ app1 ] .",

    "the physical effects on the correlation function in deep redshift - space can be placed in three categories .",

    ", where @xmath58 is the amplitude of the power spectrum , @xmath59 is the primordial spectral index , @xmath62 is the hubble parameter normalized by @xmath64 km / s / mpc , @xmath65 is the fraction of the baryon density to the total mass density , @xmath63 is the density parameter of neutrinos .",
    "the primordial spectral index @xmath59 determines the overall shape of the power spectrum . in the standard harrison - zeldovich spectrum , @xmath66 .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 determines the scale of the particle horizon at the equality epoch @xmath67 , since the radiation density is accurately known by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background , @xmath68 k @xcite . as a result , the power spectrum has a characteristic peak at @xmath69 .",
    "the baryon fraction @xmath61 and hubble parameter @xmath62 , as well as @xmath60 are responsible to the scales and strength of acoustic oscillations and silk damping .",
    "the dependences are not expressed by simple scaling relations , and useful fitting relations on physical grounds are provided by @xcite .",
    "the density parameter of neutrinos , @xmath63 characterizes the free streaming scales by the existence of the hot dark matter . in standard cold dark matter scenarios ,",
    "this parameter is negligible . in the analysis of galaxy clustering ,",
    "the spectral amplitude @xmath58 is more conveniently specified by the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath70 depends on other parameters explained above which determine the shape of the power spectrum .    in figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the dependences of the power spectrum and correlation function in real space on parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are plotted .",
    "we consider a model with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 as a fiducial case .",
    "thick lines correspond to the fiducial model , and other lines show the effects of varying individual parameters , considering @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 as independent parameters .",
    "the amplitude is normalized by @xmath76 .",
    "the upper panels show the effects on the power spectrum and the lower panels show that on the correlation function , which are the ( 3d ) fourier transforms of the corresponding power spectrum .",
    "the correlation function in comoving space is given by the function @xmath77 of equation ( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) .",
    "the oscillatory behavior appears in the power spectrum by acoustic waves before recombination epoch . since this oscillatory behavior is periodical in fourier space , just one peak",
    "is appeared in the correlation function .",
    "the scale of the peak corresponds to the sound horizon at the recombination epoch .",
    "we call this peak as a _ baryon peak _ in the correlation function .    increasing @xmath60 shifts the peak of the power spectrum to the right , so that the powers on large scales are suppressed when @xmath70 is fixed .",
    "correspondingly , the correlation function on large scales are smaller for larger @xmath60 .",
    "the scale of the zero - point of the correlation function decreases with this parameter .",
    "the location of the baryon peak is changed by @xmath78 because the sound horizon is also dependent on this parameter .",
    "the main effect of the parameter @xmath61 is on the strength of the silk damping .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath61 enhances the power on large scales when @xmath70 is fixed .",
    "the location of the baryon peak is less dependent on @xmath61 , and the absolute amplitude of the baryon peak is predominantly dependent on @xmath61 .",
    "the zero - point of the correlation function is not much affected as long as @xmath79 .",
    "although the effect of @xmath62 on the power spectrum does not seem to be significant in the figure , the phase of the baryon oscillation is shifted .",
    "this is partly because we fix @xmath60 instead of the physical dark matter density @xmath80 .",
    "since the fraction @xmath61 is also fixed , the physical densities varies with @xmath62 as @xmath81 , @xmath82 in our choice of the independent parameters .",
    "although the shape of the power spectrum is determined by the physical density parameters , the length scale should be measured in units of @xmath83 in redshift space , and one can not eliminate the explicit dependence on the hubble parameter by scalings .",
    "it is only when baryons are absent that the shape of the power spectrum is characterized by a single parameter @xmath60 , without any explicit dependence on @xmath62 .",
    "the effect of @xmath62 on the correlation function is more noticeable since the multiple baryon wiggles in the power spectrum cumulatively contribute to the baryon peak in the correlation function .",
    "the sound horizon at the recombination epoch increases with @xmath62 when @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fixed , and the location of the baryon peak is shifted to the right .",
    "the second category of the physical effects on the correlation function in deep redshift - space is the velocity distortions , or the kaiser s effects .",
    "these effects are included in second and third terms of equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) . in linear regime ,",
    "the coherent infall toward centers of density maxima flatten the clustering pattern along the lines - of - sight . depending on the geometrical angles among the observer and the two points ,",
    "the correlation function in redshift space is a linear combination of the functions @xmath84 .",
    "the functions @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , are plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] with the fiducial model of the power spectrum described above .",
    "other functions , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are not significant when @xmath36 , @xmath37 are small and are omitted in the figure .",
    "all the functions @xmath23 have irregularities on the scale of the baryon peak . since the correlation function in redshift space is expressed by a linear combination of these functions , the resulting function has the same irregularities on the same scale .",
    "the third category of the physical effects on the correlation function in deep redshift space is the extended ap effect .",
    "the irregularities on the scale of baryon peak play a role of spherical objects with known radius in comoving space .",
    "originally , @xcite proposed that measuring the ellipticity of some objects which are spherical in comoving space , the value of the cosmological constant can be constrained .",
    "it was pointed out that the power spectrum @xcite and the correlation function @xcite can serve as such objects .",
    "the baryon wiggles in the power spectrum can be used for this purpose @xcite . while the baryonic feature is split into many wiggles in the power spectrum ,",
    "there is just one peak in the correlation function .    in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , contour plots of the resulting correlation function in redshift space with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath7 are shown .",
    "the fiducial model parameters with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath71 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath73 are adopted .",

    "first point labeled by @xmath9 is sitting at the center of each plot .",
    "the contour lines represent the value of the correlation function in redshift space , @xmath105 , and the coordinates of the plots are @xmath106 . in other words ,",
    "the plots show the contours of the correlation function in apparent @xmath40-space .",
    "a prominent feature in these plots is the existence of ridges .",
    "these ridges are perfectly circular in comoving space , i.e. , they are located at the lines of constant @xmath26 .",
    "the scales of the baryon peak in comoving correlation function , which we have seen in the figure  [ fig1 ] , is indicated by thick dotted lines in the plots . obviously , the ridges correspond to the baryon peaks in comoving correlation function .",
    "therefore , we will call those ridges as the _ baryon ridges_. while the peculiar velocities alter the amplitudes of the correlation function along the ridges depending on the direction relative to the lines of sight , the shape of the ridges are not distorted by them .",
    "therefore , the baryon ridges are ideal statistically spherical objects which are useful for the extended ap test .",
    "the fourier counterpart of the baryon ridge is the acoustic rings in the power spectrum in redshift space @xcite .",
    "while the rings in the power spectrum are spread over many scales , the baryon ridges in the correlation function have just a single scale .",
    "besides the linear power spectrum at present , the correlation function in deep redshift space depends on other cosmological parameters such as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the overall amplitude of the correlation function depends on the linear growth rate @xmath14 .",

    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the dependences of the relevant functions on cosmological parameters .    in the derivatives by @xmath107 , the mass density parameter @xmath108",
    "is fixed so that the derivatives with respect to @xmath107 is equivalent to the derivatives with respect to the dark energy density parameter , @xmath112 .",
    "the redshift evolution of dark energy equation of state is parameterized by @xmath113 .",
    "the parameter sensitivity of the physical quantities are generically higher in deep redshift samples .",
    "the dark energy is less important when the redshift is too high .",
    "only the function @xmath44 is sensitive to @xmath108 at low redshifts .",
    "overall , parameter sensitivity is high at around @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , intense redshift surveys around redshift @xmath115 provide important constraints on cosmological models .",
    "accurate estimations of how the correlation function in deep redshift space can constrain the cosmological parameters are crucial in designing redshift surveys . for this purpose",
    ", we assume idealized surveys which are accessible by present - day technologies , and give estimates of the error bounds for cosmological parameters , calculating fisher information matrices . in this section",
    ", we consider @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath109 , and @xmath118 as an independent set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the bias is the most uncertain factor in galaxy redshift surveys . on linear scales ,",
    "the complex bias uncertainty is renormalized to a scale - independent linear bias parameter , @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the bias parameter is not a universal parameter and varies from sample to sample , depending on selection criteria of individual observations and also on redshifts . in the following , we always consider the situation that the bias parameter in a given sample is unknown in each sample and should be determined simultaneously with other parameters . in other words , the bias is always marginalized over in the fisher analysis below .",
    "therefore , the results in the following are free from the bias uncertainty unless the variation of the bias in each sample is too strong .",
    "the forecasts of expected errors in parameter determinations in a given sample are most easily obtained by the analysis of the fisher information matrix ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique enables us to obtain expected errors in parameter determination by a given sample without performing any monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the fisher information matrix is the expected curvature matrix around a maximum point of the logarithmic likelihood function @xmath119 in parameter space as defined by the equation ( [ eqa-1 ] ) .",
    "when the distribution of the data is given approximately by a multivariate gaussian one with a correlation matrix @xmath120 , the fisher matrix is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the set of model parameters .",
    "predictions of the error bounds when some parameters are marginalized over are also useful . for this purpose",
    ", we can define the marginalized fisher matrix by a method presented in appendix  [ app1 ] , and obtain the corresponding error forecasts .",
    "the bias parameters are always marginalized over by that method .",
    "thus , the calculation of the fisher matrix is straightforward once the correlation matrix @xmath120 of the data and its derivatives are obtained .",
    "however , the calculation of the correlation matrix depends on what kind of observed data is analyzed .",
    "a straightforward definition of the data in an analysis of the two - point correlation function is the binned values of the correlation function .",
    "the two - point correlation function in redshift space is a function of a set of the variables @xmath123 . with a suitable binning of this three - dimensional space",

    "to evaluate this correlation matrix , appropriate estimates of covariances between components of @xmath124 in a given observation with certain geometry and selection function are necessary .",
    "this is marginally possible , but requires intensive multidimensional integrations to obtain the proper correlation matrix .",
    "fortunately , there is a simpler , alternative method of evaluating the fisher matrix of a given sample , using the information of the two - point correlation function @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the data vector is taken to be pixelized galaxy counts @xmath126 in a survey sample .",
    "thus , the correlation matrix is simply given by the smoothed correlation function convolved by pixels : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the volume of the pixel @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the expected number of galaxies in that pixel .",
    "the integrated regions are limited within pixels in redshift space .",
    "the second term is the contribution from the shot noise @xcite . at first sight ,",
    "the six - dimensional integration in equation ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) seems computationally costly to perform .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that there is no need to perform these direct integrations when one can set the spherical shape of the pixels in comoving space . in which case , performing the smoothing integrations of equation ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) is equivalent to just replacing the power spectrum @xmath131 by @xmath132 in the equation ( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) , where @xmath133 is the smoothing kernel in fourier space and @xmath134 is the smoothing radius in comoving space . on one hand ,",
    "one need to know the cosmological parameters @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath109 in advance to set pixels in redshift space which are exactly spherical in comoving space . on the other hand ,",
    "the slight ellipticity of the pixels does not change the value of the correlation matrix which is calculated by assuming spherical pixels .",
    "therefore , with an approximate set of cosmological parameters , one need not to perform the integrations of equation ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) and directly obtain an accurate correlation matrix in just the same way as computing the correlation function itself in redshift space .    in the following , we use the latter method to calculate the fisher matrix .",
    "the correlation matrix of equation ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) is calculated from the expected number density in each cells and models of the correlation function .",
    "the fisher matrix with any marginalization is obtained only from the correlation matrix .",
    "one of the advantages of the deep redshift surveys is that the information from the time sequence of the galaxy clustering is available .",
    "since the solid angle on the sky is limited to @xmath137 at most , the comoving volume in which we can observe galaxies is larger in high - redshift universe than in low - redshift universe .",
    "if the galaxies in a spectroscopic survey are selected in a fixed solid angle by certain criteria , as commonly done in redshift surveys like the 2df and the sdss surveys , the number density of observed galaxies becomes sparse at high redshifts .",
    "this is a critical drawback in a correlation analysis since the shot noise dominates the clustering signal on scales of interest .",
    "for example , sdss quasar sample is not optimal to determine the cosmological parameters from the clustering , because of their sparseness @xcite . to maximally take advantage of the linear formula of the correlation function in deep redshift space",
    ", clustering properties on scales of @xmath138@xmath139 provides a useful information on cosmology .",
    "too small scales suffer the nonlinear effects which has less cosmological information and have difficulties in analytical treatments .",
    "therefore , observations with a number density of over about @xmath140 is ideal .    to retain comparable number densities at different redshifts ,",
    "the survey region on the sky should be narrower at high redshifts than at low redshifts , since the total number of observed galaxies is usually limited by the observation time , or budgets .",
    "therefore , an optimal design of the redshift survey will be something similar to that illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the optimal survey illustrated here consists of several layers of sub - surveys .",
    "each sub - survey is optimized to catalog particular redshift range and has selection criteria that is most effective to pick the galaxies up in corresponding range of redshift .",
    "while simple color selections can be used for this purpose , the photometric redshift data might be the best to fulfill the required selections .",
    "in low - redshift layers , the surface number density of galaxies for the spectroscopy can be low , while the sky coverage of the survey regions should be wide . in high - redshift layers ,",
    "the surface number density should be high , while the sky coverage can be narrow .",
    "the requirements of the telescope for each layers are different .",
    "thus this optimal survey would effectively carried out by several telescopes with a wide spectrum of capabilities such as resolutions and wideness of the field of view .",
    "one can also imagine a limit of infinite number of layers .",
    "the survey geometry in this case is like a big column in redshift space , as illustrated in figure  [ fig6 ] .    in this case",
    ", the selection criteria should continuously vary with the position on the sky , therefore delicate selections are required to sample galaxies as homogeneously as possible . while technically more challenging , this survey strategy is ideal for the cosmological analysis of the clustering at various redshifts in the deep universe .    in this section , however , we consider more realistic surveys that can be achieved by present - day technologies .",
    "we take the series of baseline redshift surveys explained below .",
    "the surveys are categorized to four types , which are assumed to be volume - limited samples .",
    "the choices of samples at high - redshifts are similar to that considered by @xcite .",
    "the first sample is a low - redshift sample around @xmath141 .",
    "this sample is motivated by a volume - limited subsample of galaxies in the sdss survey @xcite with absolute @xmath142-magnitude @xmath143 .",
    "our baseline sample has a uniform number density @xmath144 in the redshift range @xmath145@xmath146 .",
    "the sky coverage is assumed to be @xmath147 str .",
    "the bias factor is assumed to be @xmath148 .",
    "we call this sample as _ sample a _ below .",
    "the second sample is the one around @xmath149 .",
    "this sample is motivated by the volume - limited catalog of the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sdss survey @xcite .",
    "our sample is assumed to have @xmath150 , @xmath151@xmath152 , @xmath153 str . , and @xmath154 .",
    "we call this sample as _ sample b _ below .",
    "the next samples are the series of surveys around @xmath155 .",
    "the choice of the target galaxies is not trivial .",
    "we follow the baseline surveys that are considered by @xcite .",
    "the target galaxies are assumed to be either giant ellipticals or luminous star - forming galaxies .",
    "this category of samples consists of surveys of four redshift bins , @xmath156@xmath157 , @xmath158@xmath159 , @xmath160@xmath161 , and @xmath162@xmath163 .",
    "the sky coverage is assumed to be @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 , respectively .",
    "the bias factors are @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "approximately we have @xmath172 in each samples with the above choices of bias factors .",
    "we assume @xmath173 commonly for each samples .",
    "we call the series of samples as _ sample c1 _ to _",

    "the last sample is the survey of lyman break galaxies around @xmath174 .",

    "the spherical cells with a comoving radius @xmath184 are placed in closed - packed structure in a survey region .",
    "the total number of cells is exactly 4900 in each 1/10 subsample .",
    "thus the comoving volumes of all samples are essentially the same . the resulting fisher matrix is multiplied by 10 to obtain the final fisher matrix .",
    "this method of subdividing the sample into 1/10 is taken to reduce the dimension of the matrix and to compromise with the cpu time and the memory requirement of handling the large correlation matrix . in general ,",
    "the subdivision overestimates the error bounds because the information from cross correlations between subsamples is neglected .",
    "however , the larger the sample is , the less such cross correlations are .",
    "we confirmed that the error bounds of the full sample is accurately calculated by just adding the fisher matrices of the subsamples in our case .      according to the calculation of the fisher matrix ,",
    "the expected error bounds with any marginalization are straightforwardly obtained by methods explained in appendix  [ app1 ] . since the bias parameter should be simultaneously determined sample by sample , we calculate the fisher matrix of each sample with bias separately marginalized over within each sample .",
    "therefore , the results below are not affected by bias uncertainties , as long as the bias factor does not significantly varies within each samples .    in figure  [ fig7 ] , concentration ellipsoids in 2-parameter estimations",
    "are plotted , i.e. , each panel shows the expected error bounds when corresponding two parameters are simultaneously determined , fixing other parameters except the bias parameter .",
    "the bias parameters are marginalized over .",
    "the fisher matrix of the combined sample are also calculated by adding the fisher matrices of sample a  d with bias separately marginalized over sample by sample .",
    "most of the pairs of parameters do not exhibit degeneracy between them .",
    "this means that those pairs of parameters contribute to the correlation function fairly differently as explained in  3 .",
    "however , one can notice relatively clear degeneracies between @xmath185 and @xmath109 .",
    "since we consider @xmath108 and @xmath185 as independent parameters , changing the parameter @xmath185 is equivalent to changing the dark energy density @xmath186 with @xmath108 fixed .",
    "the parameters of the dark energy are mainly constrained by ap effect besides the linear growth rate . in the low - redshift samples",
    ", the parameters @xmath112 and @xmath109 only depend on the growth rate and thus degenerate with each other .",
    "since the bias parameter and the growth rate is distinguishable by the velocity distortion , one can still extract information on the dark energy from low - redshift sample with the cost of the degeneracy . on the other hand , high - redshift samples can actually constrain these two dark energy parameter independently .",
    "the direction of the major axis of the concentration ellipse in the @xmath107@xmath109 plane rotates anti - clockwise with the average redshift of the samples .",
    "accordingly , the concentration ellipse of the combined sample is quite small .",
    "for example , the error bound of @xmath112 is @xmath187 and that of @xmath109 is @xmath188 .",
    "the presented error bounds are given when the other parameters are fixed except the bias .",
    "it is also interesting to see the expected constraints when all parameters are determined by only using the deep galaxy surveys . in figure",
    "[ fig8 ] , the concentration ellipses are plotted on @xmath107@xmath109 plane when the other parameters @xmath108 , @xmath116 , @xmath61 , @xmath70 and @xmath118 s are all marginalized over .",
    "the complementarity of the surveys at various redshifts is obvious in this case .",
    "the concentration ellipses of high - redshift samples are also elongated by uncertainties of other parameters .",
    "the direction of the major axis of the ellipses rotates anti - clockwise with redshifts .",
    "consequently , the degeneracy between @xmath107 and @xmath109 are broken in the combined sample and the error bound is much smaller than in the individual samples . the error bound of @xmath112 is @xmath189 and that of @xmath109 is @xmath190 even when all the other parameters are completely unknown .",
    "in this paper , properties of the two - point correlation function in deep redshift space is theoretically investigated .",
    "a completely general expression of the linear correlation function derived by @xcite is reduced to a simpler form , eq.([eq2 - 8])([eq2 - 14 ] ) with an approximation which is valid for realistic surveys .",
    "baryon wiggles in the power spectrum correspond to a single peak in the correlation function .",
    "this peak differently depends on the parameters of the underlying power spectrum , @xmath191 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . in the two - dimensional contour plot of the correlation function in redshift space ,",
    "the corresponding feature is the baryonic ridge .",
    "the shape of the ridge is perfectly circular in comoving space , in spite of the effects of the peculiar velocity .",
    "this is preferable for the cosmological test by the ap effect . using the analysis of the fisher information matrix ,",
    "the cosmological test by the correlation function in deep redshift space is shown to constrain the properties of the dark energy component as well as other cosmological parameters , even if the bias is uncertain .",
    "in particular , there is a clear complementarity of the samples of various redshift ranges in probing the dark energy component .",
    "therefore , a survey of a wide redshift range is particularly useful to probe the dark energy . keeping a sufficient number density of galaxies in the given observation time ,",
    "examples of the optimally designed survey geometry are illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] and figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "selecting galaxies for the spectroscopic follow - ups as densely as possible is one of the major technical challenges in this kind of survey strategy .",
    "however , recent advances of the technology enable us to carry it out",
    ". with the advent of 8 - 10 m telescopes , galaxies of @xmath192 can be straightforwardly selected by color selections as demonstrated by , e.g. , the sdss survey @xcite and the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite . in @xmath193 ,",
    "lyman - break galaxies are photometrically selected with sufficient density @xcite .",
    "the range @xmath194 is known as the _ redshift desert _ , since spectroscopic identifications of galaxies were historically difficult .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that large numbers of galaxies in this range can actually be selected with standard broadband color selection technique using the keck i telescope with the lris - b spectrograph .",
    "thus galaxies at @xmath0 can be optically selected by ground - based 8 - 10 m telescopes with sufficient number densities @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proposed surveys illustrated by figure  [ fig5 ] and figure  [ fig6 ] in the redshift range of @xmath0 with approximately homogeneous selections are accessible by present - day technologies .",
    "cosmology with the large - scale structure has mainly been studied by the snapshot of the nearly present universe , since the sufficient number of galaxies have been available only at shallow redshifts , @xmath195 .",
    "cmb observations , on the other hand , map the universe of the @xmath196 universe .",
    "the observations of the galaxy clustering in the deep - redshift universe of @xmath197 , which are within reach of the present - day technology , will provide a unique information on the evolving universe with the analysis of the correlation function presented in this paper .",

    ". only data of the snapshots of the universe are not enough to confirm the consistency of the cosmological model . whether or not the structure of the universe with respect to both space and time are fully explained by minimal set of cosmological assumptions and parameters will be a major concern in cosmology . in the era of the precision cosmology ,",
