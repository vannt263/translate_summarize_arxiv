    "nearly coherent 270620 hz oscillations have been observed during type  i x - ray bursts@xcite from neutron stars in nine low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; see van der klis 2000 for a recent review ) .",
    "oscillations may occur because a hot spot forms on the rotating neutron star surface during the burst @xcite .",
    "their frequency evolution has been interpreted in terms of a burning layer that expands by @xmath250  m and slows at the start of the burst , only to spin up again over several seconds as the layer contracts @xcite .",
    "the pairs of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ; see van der klis 2000 for a review ) observed in the persistent emission of most burst oscillation sources naturally divide the sources into two categories .",
    "the frequencies of these twin khz qpos vary by up to a factor of 2 , while their separation @xmath3 varies by at most @xmath4% and suggests the relation @xmath5 , with @xmath6 for the three sources with a `` slow '' @xmath7  hz and @xmath8 for the six sources with a `` fast '' @xmath9  hz @xcite .",
    "this relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath10 has been interpreted in terms of a beat frequency model for the khz qpos relating the inner accretion disk motion with the neutron star spin frequency , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this model presumes that @xmath12 and suggests that sources with slow burst oscillations  ( @xmath6 ) have a single visible hot spot on their surface and that sources with fast burst oscillations  ( @xmath8 ) have a pair of hot spots @xcite .",
    "this further suggests that all nine sources have @xmath13  hz , and several authors have proposed mechanisms for a natural spin equilibrium near this frequency ( white & zhang 1997 ; bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the khz qpos in terms of relativistic accretion - disk precession has also been proposed ( stella & vietri 1998 ; psaltis & norman 2000 ) , but it does not explicitly address the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "millisecond oscillations do not occur in every burst from these nine lmxbs .",
    "@xcite found that oscillations from  are usually observed only in bursts which exhibit photospheric radius expansion , during which the apparent radius of the emission region increases by @xmath14  km because the flux at the surface of the neutron star exceeds the eddington limit . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite found that bursts from _ without _ radius expansion exhibited oscillations more often than radius expansion bursts .",
    "one common property of both sources is that millisecond oscillations are only observed from bursts which occur on the so - called `` banana '' branch of their x - ray color - color diagrams , which corresponds to relatively high accretion rates ( see van der klis 1995 for a review of lmxb phenomenology ) . in this _",
    ", we explore these dependencies of the burst oscillation phenomenon on burst properties by making a comparison between x - ray bursts with and without coherent oscillations in all 9 sources using archival data from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we have examined all observations of 828 , we use the results from strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1997a ) . for the same reason",
    ", the persistent emission can not be isolated for this source .",
    "] of the 9 burst oscillation sources in the _ rxte _ public archive as of 2001 march 22 .",
    "we searched all of the data taken with the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) for type  i bursts and found a total of 125 bursts with data that allowed both timing and spectral analyses .",
    "these bursts are summarized by source in table  1 .",
    "for the five sources for which detailed burst studies have been published , our results are consistent with the published work (:",
    "chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ; : wijnands , strohmayer , & franco 2001 ; : fox et al . 2001",
    "; : muno et al .",
    "2000 ; : franco 2001 , van straaten et al . 2001 ; and : galloway et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in order to characterize the persistent emission",
    ", we calculated average soft ( 3.75.1 kev/2.33.7 kev ) and hard ( 8.718 kev/5.18.7 kev ) x - ray colors for 256  s intervals using background - subtracted light curves . location on an x - ray color - color diagram is a good tracer of the accretion rate @xmath15 ( see van der klis 1995 and references therein ) . @xcite and @xcite exhibit bursts over the widest range of @xmath15 , while cursory checks of the color - color diagrams for the other sources suggest that bursts were only observed at high accretion rates because few or no observations were made during low @xmath15 intervals .    to search for oscillations",
    ", we created twice - oversampled power spectra for 2  s intervals of data every 0.25  s for the duration of each burst . if oscillations are detected within @xmath16  hz of the expected frequency and within 10 seconds after the start of a burst with a probability @xmath17 that the signal is due to poisson noise in a single trial , we consider the oscillation to be a detection .",
    "we also used this technique to search all of the bursts for oscillations at the first three harmonics of the slow oscillations , and at 0.5 , 1.5 , and 2.0 times the frequency of the fast oscillations .",
    "we found no evidence for oscillations at these frequencies in any of the bursts .",
    "using power spectra of 1 s intervals , we can place upper limits on the fractional rms amplitude of oscillations at these frequencies of 515% during a burst .",
    "these are not very stringent upper limits , so application of more sensitive search techniques such as those described in @xcite , @xcite , and strohmayer ( 2001 ) will be useful for more detailed studies .",
    "we produced energy spectra for each 0.25 s interval from each burst using available combinations of data modes which provide at least 32 energy channels .",
    "we subtracted spectra from 15 s of emission from before the burst to account for background , and fit each spectrum between 2.520 kev with a model consisting of a blackbody multiplied by a constant interstellar absorption ( determined from the mean value from fits using variable absorption ) .",
    "the model provides an apparent temperature ( @xmath18 ) and a normalization equal to the square of the apparent radius ( @xmath19 ) of the burst emission surface , and allows us to estimate the bolometric flux as a function of time .",
    "the peak flux of bursts from a given source can vary by a factor of 510 . in many bursts ,",
    "photospheric radius expansion is evident at the start of the burst , during which @xmath20 increases and @xmath18 decreases such that the bolometric flux remains constant , presumably at the eddington limit ( see lewin et al .",
    "our definition of radius expansion includes bursts which exhibit a second increase in radius immediately after the minimum which follows the expansion phase .",
    "we find several such bursts from ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one such burst from both and .",
    "a summary of our results for the nine burst oscillation sources is given in table  1 .",
    "there is a tight connection between the presence of oscillations and of radius expansion in fast ( @xmath21  hz ) sources from every perspective .",
    "fast oscillations occur predominantly during bursts with radius expansion , and almost all bursts with radius expansion exhibit oscillations . at the same time",
    "most of the bursts without fast oscillations also lack radius expansion . in slow ( @xmath1  hz ) sources",
    ", there is no preference for whether bursts with or without radius expansion exhibit oscillations .",
    "this suggests that the frequencies of burst oscillations and the properties of bursts are connected .",
    "although the sample of bursts from an individual source is in some cases quite small , the correlations for fast and slow sources as groups are quite significant . in order to quantify the significance of our results",
    ", we hypothesize that radius expansion occurs in bursts with a fixed probability , @xmath22 .",
    "given a sample of @xmath23 bursts , the probability of observing a number @xmath24 of bursts with radius expansion is @xmath25 we can then compute the probability density for @xmath22 given @xmath24 radius expansion bursts in a sample of @xmath23 bursts , @xmath26 .",
    "we have plotted these probability densities in figure  [ dist ] for fast and slow sources , considering as our sample population either all observed bursts ( dashed line ) and only those bursts which exhibit oscillations ( solid line ) . although fast and slow sources exhibit radius expansion in about equal fractions of bursts in general , fast sources exhibit radius expansion during bursts with oscillations far more often ( 88@xmath27% of the time ) than slow sources ( 31@xmath28% ) .",
    "the trends for individual sources are interesting in that they follow the behavior expected from considering the sources as groups ( figure  [ whendo ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , slow sources are more likely to show radius expansion during bursts _ without _ oscillations ( 53@xmath29% ) than fast sources ( 20@xmath30% ) .",
    "we can rule out some observational selection effects as causes for these correlations .",
    "for example , we are not systematically missing oscillations from weak bursts , as might occur if all oscillations had the same fractional amplitude .",
    "we observe oscillations in some of the weakest bursts from , , , and , while no oscillations are detected during some of the stronger bursts from these sources .",
    "therefore , our correlations are based upon genuine variations in the strengths of the oscillations .",
    "however , since bursts were observed from only two sources at low @xmath15 (  and ) , there is a remote chance that these correlations are an artifact of the higher @xmath15 at which the remaining sources were observed .",
    "for instance , the bursts with the longest time scales take place at low fluxes in @xcite and at low inferred @xmath15 in @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that these long bursts do not exhibit radius expansion ( as in ; see for example muno et al .",
    "2000 ) , so there would be no strict relationship between radius expansion and fast oscillations if these bursts exhibit oscillations .",
    "however , we would consider this a surprise given the absence of oscillations at low accretion rates in   and .",
    "on the other hand , the time scales of bursts from the slow oscillators ( swank , taam , & white 1984 ) and @xcite have not been observed to vary systematically with the persistent flux , so we can not predict how observing bursts at low @xmath15 in slow sources would affect our correlations .",
    "we have found that oscillations from the 6 fast burst oscillation sources are tightly connected to photospheric radius expansion , whereas oscillations from the 3 slow sources are about equally likely to be found in bursts both with and without radius expansion .",
    "what drives this correlation remains to be determined : is it the burst properties themselves , the oscillation frequencies , or some unseen third parameter ?    according to the beat frequency model of khz qpos , the fact that @xmath31 for the `` slow '' sources whereas @xmath32 for the `` fast '' ones can be accounted for if one or two antipodal hot spots on the surface of the rotating neutron star are visible to the observer ( miller et al .",
    "one possibility is that the distinction between fast and slow oscillations is due to a difference in the orientation of the hot spots and the observer with respect to the rotation axis of the star .",
    "this seems unlikely .",
    "radius expansion is observed with similar likelihood from both fast and slow sources , and therefore is unlikely to depend on our viewing angle .",
    "we would not expect oscillations to be associated with radius expansion bursts only in the fast sources if viewing angle effects determine whether one or two spots are observed .",
    "it also does not appear that the strengths of the bursts determine the oscillation frequencies by igniting either one or two hot spots .",
    "if this were the case , one would expect to detect slow oscillations during weak bursts without radius expansion from the fast sources , and fast oscillations during strong bursts from the slow sources . out of the 125 bursts we observed from sources of burst oscillations ,",
    "we find no evidence for harmonic or half - frequency signals with powers comparable to the signals at the frequencies in table  [ sum ] .    if the distinction between slow and fast oscillators is equivalent to a division between slow and fast rotators , @xmath11 ( or some related quantity , e.g. , the effective surface gravity ) could determine which bursts show oscillations .",
    "however , that option is not free of complications , as the transition between the burst properties for sources that exhibit fast and slow oscillations must be very sharp , since the two populations are not at all well separated in frequency ( see table  [ sum ] ) .",
    "when comparing the observed distribution of @xmath10 to a uniform distribution of frequencies between 250650  hz , a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( e.g. , eadie et al .  1971 ) can exclude a uniform distribution at only the 1.3@xmath33 ( 81% ) confidence level .",
    "it is interesting to note that the recent report of a possible @xmath34  hz burst oscillation from the 401  hz pulsar sax j1808.4@xmath353658 ( in t zand et al .",
    "2001 ) would make the @xmath10 distribution even more consistent with a uniform distribution ( excluded at only the 0.9@xmath33 or 64% confidence level ) , so the putative transition would have to be correspondingly sharper .",
    "we have listed a few additional properties of these lmxbs in table  [ sum ] . neither the activity level nor the long - term average accretion rate @xmath36 , as determined from nearly 5 years of data from the _ rxte _  all - sky monitor ( levine et al . 1996 ) , appears to be correlated with the frequencies of the burst oscillations .",
    "fast oscillations are observed in both transient ( and ) and persistent ( e.g. , ) sources , as well as from both low @xmath36 and high @xmath36 sources .",
    "orbital periods are measured for only 4 of the 9 sources , and range from 0.81 to 19 hours .",
    "it is apparent that these burst oscillation sources are an inhomogeneous group , which makes measurements of oscillations from other sources highly desirable .",
    "we feel that the most likely explanation for the observed correlations is that the burst properties change differently as a function of @xmath15 in fast and slow sources .",
    "x - ray burst theory predicts that radius expansion should occur only at low @xmath15 ( fujimoto , hanawa , & miyaji 1981 ; ayasli & joss 1982 ) .",
    "this agrees with observations of the slow oscillator ( franco 2000 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ) , but does not appear to hold true for the fast oscillators @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite . if oscillations only appear at high @xmath15 ( as suggested by franco 2001 ) , then they would indeed be associated with radius expansion in the fast sources , but not the slow sources .",
    "furthermore , bildsten ( 2000 ) has suggested that some mechanism acts in these latter sources to confine the accreted material such that the _ local _ @xmath15 can decrease even as the global @xmath15 increases . if this is true , such confinement is somehow related to the higher frequency of the fast burst oscillations",
