    "recurrent outbursts in accreting systems are commonly attributed to global instabilities in their associated accretion discs . in particular , it is believed that thermal instability driven by strong variations in the disc s cooling rate causes the observed state transitions in dwarf novae ( dne ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( lasota 2001 ) , while the rich array of accretion variability associated with quasars could be excited by thermal instability driven by variations in the turbulent heating rate ( shakura and sunyaev 1976 , abramowicz et al .  1988 ) , by thermal - viscous instability ( lightman & eardley 1974 ) , or assorted dynamical instabilities ( e.g.  papaloizou & pringle 1984 , kato 2003 , ferreira & ogilvie 2009 ) . on the other hand , fu ori outbursts , characteristic of protostellar discs , probably result from the interplay of thermal , gravitational , and magnetorotational instability ( mri ) across the intermittently inert dead zone ( gammie 1996 , balbus & hawley 1998 , armitage et al .",
    "2002 , zhu et al .  2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "exceptions to this class of model include classical novae whose outbursts can be traced to thermonucleur fusion of accreted material on the white dwarf surface ( gallagher & starrfield 1978 , shara 1989 , starrfield et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the most developed , and possibly most successful , model of accretion disc outbursts describes the recurrent eruptions that characterise the light curves of dne and lmxbs . in this model , the ionisation of hydrogen , occurring at temperatures of around 5000 k , induces a significant opacity change in the disc orbiting the primary star ( faulkner et al .",
    "1983 , hereafter flp83 ) , which then leads to thermal instability and hysteresis in the disc gas ( pringle 1981 ) .",
    "the system exhibits a characteristic ` s - curve ' in the phase plane of surface density @xmath0 and central temperature @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) , and as a consequence the gas falls into one of two stable states : an optically thick hot state , characterized by strong accretion , or an optically thin cooler state , in which accretion is less efficient ( e.g. meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , flp83 ) .",
    "outbursts can then be modelled via a ` limit cycle ' , whereby the disc jumps from the low accreting state to the high accreting state and then back again as mass builds up and is then evacuated .",
    "this mechanism , based on local bistable equilibria , is the foundation for a variety of advanced models , which have enjoyed significant successes in reproducing the observed behaviour of accretion discs in binary systems , even if interesting discrepancies persist ( lasota 2001 ) .",
    "the classical model of dne and lmxbs treats the disc as laminar and assumes that the disc turbulence can be modelled with the @xmath2 prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , whereby the action of the turbulent stresses is characterized as a diffusive process with an associated ` eddy ' viscosity ( balbus & papaloizou 1999 ) .",
    "this has been sufficient to sketch out the qualitative features of putative outbursts , but such a crude description has imposed limitations on the formalism that are now impeding further progress ( lasota 2012 ) . on the other hand , fully consistent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd )",
    "simulations of disc turbulence generated by the mri have been performed for almost 20 years ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 , stone et al .",
    "1996 , hawley 2000 , etc ) , though typically with simplified thermodynamics ( e.g.  isothermality ) .",
    "it is the task of this paper to begin the process of uniting the classic thermal instability models of dne and lmxbs with full mhd simulations of the mri , and thus consistently account for both the turbulence and radiative cooling .",
    "the first step we take is limited to local models , as even though discs undergo global outbursts , the ability of local annuli to exhibit hysteresis behaviour is key .",
    "local studies will permit us to assess if and how the classic model of thermal instability can operate in the presence of realistic turbulent heating .",
    "at the same time , they provide an excellent test of the mri itself ; if the mri is to remain the chief candidate driving disc accretion it must fulfil its obligations to classical disc theory .",
    "we undertake unstratified shearing box simulations of the mri that include ohmic and viscous heating and a radiative cooling prescription that is able to mimic the transition between the optically thin and thick states ( flp83 ) .",
    "these simulations clearly reproduce s - curves in the @xmath0 and mean temperature plane , and these constitute the main result of our paper .",
    "we can thus animate local thermal limit cycles via a sequence of local box runs .",
    "in particular , the simulated turbulent heating is found to be ` well - behaved ' and not so intermittent as to prematurely disrupt the thermal limit cycles required by the classical theory .",
    "in addition , simulations with differing net toroidal and vertical fluxes produce s - curves that exhibit variable mean values of @xmath2 , suggesting that when global simulations are considered , and net - flux is no longer conserved locally , variations in effective @xmath2 between the upper and lower branches of the s - curve may be produced , as required by the classical model ( e.g.  smak 1984a ) .    finally , the simulated short - term behaviours of the average viscous stress and the disc pressure reveal only a weak functional dependence , as remarked upon by previous authors ( hirose et al .",
    "this poor correlation means that proposed thermal instabilities driven by a direct heating response to imposed pressure perturbations are unlikely to function in radiation - pressure dominated accretion discs ( e.g.  shakura & sunyaev 1976 , abramowicz et al .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the thermal instabilities implicated in dne and lmxbs , which are driven by the cooling response to imposed temperature perturbations , mediated via opacity variations .",
    "note , however , that over _ long times _ we find that the stress and pressure are correlated .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the following section we discuss the thermal instability model for dne and lmxbs in more detail . in section 3",
    "we present the governing equations while outlining the radiative cooling prescription the simulations adopt . in section 4",
    "we give the numerical details of the simulations .",
    "our results are presented in section 5 , and we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we consider close binary systems that consist of one low - mass lobe - filling star transferring material to a degenerate companion , either a white dwarf or a black - hole / neutron star .",
    "the characteristic feature of these systems is their recurrent eruptive activity in the optical or x - ray spectrum , respectively .",
    "dne undergo outbursts of some 2 - 5 magnitude which last 2 - 20 days , with recurrence intervals ranging from 10 days to years ( see e.g.warner 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , certain sources exhibit more complex behaviour , such as ` superoutbursts ' and ` standstills ' ( whereby the cycle is interrupted for an indefinite period ) .",
    "lmxbs are poorly constrained relative to dne because they emit almost exclusively in x - rays , and so do not enjoy the same observational coverage .",
    "even so , it has been established that their outbursts exhibit luminosity enhancements of several orders of magnitude , while their spectra progress through a series of canonical x - ray states ( mcclintock and remillard 2006 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that outbursts in these systems take place in the accretion disc that orbits around the primary star and are triggered once sufficient mass has built up in the disc . during an outburst",
    "the disc jumps from a cool low - accreting state to a hot high - accreting state that deposits this surfeit of material onto the central object .",
    "after this mass has been evacuated the disc returns to its low state and the cycle repeats .",
    "the basic outline of the model was first proposed by smak ( 1971 ) and osaki ( 1974 ) ; but the physical basis for instability in the disc was not understood till much later ( flp83 , see also hoshi 1979 ) .",
    "researchers now recognise that the cycles are the consequence of a thermal instability related to the variation of opacity with temperature .",
    "above roughly @xmath3k the collisional ionisation of hydrogen commences , and this liberates an increasing number of free electrons that enhance the gas opacity @xmath4 . the dependence of opacity on temperature , for a range of densities , is conveniently illustrated in fig .",
    "9 of bell & lin ( 1994 ) .",
    "the figure shows that , after ionisation of hydrogen is complete @xmath5k , we have roughly @xmath6 , and thus @xmath4 decreases with temperature . on the other hand , cold molecular gas , with @xmath7k ,",
    "exhibits a @xmath4 that also decreases with temperature , primarily on account of dust grain destruction .",
    "but the gas opacity in the intermediate temperature regime between these two limits _ increases _ rapidly with temperature , because of the flood of free electrons .",
    "here @xmath8 , approximately . this dramatic tendency for heat to be better trapped as",
    "temperature increases leads immediately to thermal instability in this regime .",
    "the instability criterion can be formulated quantitatively via the following argument .",
    "let us denote by @xmath9 the local turbulent dissipation rate per unit area .",
    "then local thermal equilibrium is determined by balancing this injection rate against the disc s radiative losses : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective temperature of the disc s photosphere and @xmath12 is stefan s constant .",
    "if we now denote by @xmath1 the midplane temperature of the disc , a local thermal stability criterion for this state is simply : @xmath13 ( lasota 2001 ) .",
    "this expresses the requirement that when the midplane temperature @xmath1 is increased , the cooling response via radiation must outstrip the increase in the heating .",
    "if this condition is not met , then the midplane temperature increase will be reinforced and there will be a thermal runaway .    at high temperatures , well above the ionisation threshold , we find that the disc radiates efficiently and that @xmath14 .",
    "the heating rate @xmath9 , on the other hand , increases much more slowly ( @xmath15 for a laminar @xmath2 model ) and so thermal stability ensues .",
    "however , in the transition regime , where @xmath16 k , the photospheric temperature @xmath11 varies very weakly with @xmath1 because the opacity is increasing rapidly .",
    "the cooling rate barely responds to an increase in central temperature @xmath1 , which leads to the trapping of excess heat and thermal instability . at the lowest temperatures , @xmath17k , stability",
    "is recovered because the disc enters an optically thin regime in which the rate of surface radiation increases rapidly with @xmath1 . in summary ,",
    "the disc is bistable and will tend to move to one of two thermally stable steady regimes : ( a ) hot and ionised ( hence efficiently accreting ) , with @xmath18k ; or ( b ) cold and predominantly neutral ( less efficiently accreting ) with @xmath19k .",
    "in addition , there exists an unstable intermediate equilibrium state between these two limits .",
    "disc modelling of flp83 . for reference",
    "the parameters were @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( see section 3 and the appendix ) .",
    "we remark that in this figure , central temperature is plotted as ordinate . however , if the mass flow rate @xmath24 is used instead , a curve of the same qualitative form results ( flp83).,width=288,height=192 ]    because for a given surface density @xmath0 there can be up to three @xmath1 associated with a thermal equilibrium , the family of equilibrium solutions sketches out a characteristic s - curve in either the @xmath25 plane or , alternatively , the @xmath26 plane , where @xmath27 is mass accretion rate .",
    "note that @xmath27 can be directly related to @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( e.g.  see flp83 and section [ diagnostics ] below ) . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot a representative family of such thermal equilibria in the @xmath25 plane computed via the techniques of flp83 .",
    "there is a range of @xmath0 for which the system supports three states , two stable ( indicated with a blue colour ) , one unstable ( indicated with a red colour ) .    in fig .",
    "1 the trajectory of the outbursting limit cycle is represented by the black arrows .",
    "consider gas physically located at the outermost disc radii and in a thermodynamic state associated with the lower branch . at this radius",
    ", mass steadily accumulates because accretion onto the primary star can not match the mass transfer into the disc from the secondary .",
    "consequently , the surface density increases and we travel up the lower branch until it ends , at which point the gas heats up dramatically .",
    "once it settles on the upper branch accretion is much more efficient and a transition wave propagates through the disc ( papaloizou et al .",
    "1983 , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1984 , smak 1984a ) .",
    "provided conditions are favourable and the front propagates inwards , converting the entire disc into an upper state , there will be a global outburst that results in a significant mass deposit onto the primary .",
    "consequently , the surface density everywhere decreases until the disc undergoes a downward transition to the lower branch .",
    "our discussion of the thermal equilibria and limit cycles need only consider local models of an accretion disc .",
    "however , more advanced dn and lmxb models must incorporate additional global physics in order to capture the heating and cooling fronts that mediate branch changes , and ultimately to match specific observations in detail ( e.g.  papaloizou et al .",
    "1983 , smak 1984b , ichikawa & osaki 1992 , menou et al .",
    "even so , all such global treatments are founded on the hysteresis behaviour of the local model ( single annulus ) outlined above . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on this fundamental engine of instability .",
    "our aim is to show that it can function in the presence of turbulence generated by the mri .",
    "this is intended as a first step in moving disc outburst modelling away from the heuristic @xmath2 prescription .",
    "future work can then include the detailed global physics .",
    "we adopt the local shearing box model ( goldreich & lynden - bell , 1965 ) and a cartesian coordinate system @xmath28 with origin at the centre of the box .",
    "these coordinates represent the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions respectively .",
    "vertical stratification is neglected .",
    "the basic equations express the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy and include the induction equation for the magnetic field .",
    "they incorporate a constant kinematic viscosity @xmath29 and magnetic diffusivity @xmath30 the continuity equation , equation of motion , and induction equations are given by @xmath31 and the first law of thermodynamics is written in the form @xmath32 here the convective derivative is defined through @xmath33 @xmath34 is the keplerian orbital frequency evaluated at the centre of the box , @xmath35 is the velocity , @xmath36 is the magnetic field and @xmath37 is the internal energy per unit mass .",
    "the tidal potential is @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the ( radiative ) cooling rate per unit volume .",
    "the right hand side of equation ( [ energycons ] ) includes contributions from viscous dissipation , ohmic heating and radiative losses .",
    "the components of the viscous stress tensor @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 in addition , the magnetic field must satisfy @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we adopt an ideal gas equation of state @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the isothermal sound speed , with @xmath45 the temperature , @xmath46 the gas constant , and @xmath47 the mean molecular weight .      in order to proceed",
    ", we need to realistically account for the radiative cooling of the gas , via the term @xmath39 .",
    "the shearing box by definition is located far from the disc s upper and lower surfaces with periodic boundary conditions applied in the vertical direction . nevertheless , we can approximate the box s radiative losses in a physically meaningful way via a prescription outlined in flp83 .",
    "our model assumes that the cooling @xmath39 is a function only of time and horizontal position @xmath48 .",
    "it is taken to be @xmath49 where @xmath11 is interpreted as the effective temperature at the upper and lower vertical boundary of the disc .",
    "here @xmath50 is a reference scale height .",
    "the main task is to derive how the surface temperature @xmath11 varies in response to changes in the midplane temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we envisage that @xmath11 takes a different form in three distinct physical disc regimes .    1",
    ".   the first regime corresponds to the hot optically thick conditions associated with the disc s high accreting state . in such a state ,",
    "the disc s photospheric temperature @xmath11 is marginally above the value appropriate for the ionisation threshold for hydrogen ( @xmath51 k ) and so the entire disc is optically thick .",
    "the classical relationship @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is midplane optical depth , can be used to relate @xmath11 and @xmath54 as most of the optical depth comes from the regions close to the midplane , @xmath53 can be evaluated using the midplane opacity .",
    "2 .   the second regime corresponds to an intermediate ` hybrid ' state in which the midplane is hot and partially ionised but the surface layers have become sufficiently cool for hydrogen ionisation to fall off sharply . as a consequence ,",
    "the opacity drops near the photosphere with drastic consequences for the disc s vertical temperature structure , as in cool stars ( hayashi & hoshi 1961 ) .",
    "the classical dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath1 breaks down , with the connection between the two becoming quite weak .",
    "instead , we must determine @xmath11 from the outer boundary condition @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is photospheric optical depth .",
    "the third regime corresponds to the cool optically thin regime in which the entire disc , including the midplane , lies marginally below the ionisation threshold . in this regime ,",
    "consideration of direct cooling then yields a simple approximate relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath11 .    in the appendix we consider each regime in turn and",
    "obtain three functional forms relating @xmath11 to @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "our final expression for @xmath11 is an interpolation formula , eq .",
    ", connecting these different regimes . in summary ,",
    "the prescription for finding @xmath11 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are two dimensionless constants , and the midplane optical depth is @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the opacity evaluated at the midplane density @xmath62 and temperature @xmath1 .",
    "all dimensional quantities are in cgs units . as in flp83 the opacity in regime 1",
    "is taken to be @xmath63 and in regime 3 it is taken to be @xmath64 in addition , @xmath65 finally , we specify a constant @xmath47 for all regimes .",
    "this of course neglects partial ionization , but should not interfere especially in our qualitative results .",
    "in flp83 , thermal equilibrium solutions are computed by matching the cooling rate , computed according to the above procedure , with the turbulent alpha heating , for which the volume heating rate is @xmath66 where the shakura - sunyaev @xmath67 parameter is a dimensionless constant less than one ( cf .",
    ". these solutions may be viewed as relations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , though they are more commonly re - expressed as relations between @xmath0 and @xmath68 some of these s - curves are illustrated in figs [ fig:1 ] and 4 - 6 .",
    "we solve equations - with a parallel version of zeus ( stone & norman 1992a , 1992b ) .",
    "this uses a finite difference scheme to obtain the spatial derivatives , is first order explicit in time , and employs constrained transport to ensure @xmath36 remains solenoidal .",
    "our version of zeus has been altered according to improvements outlined by lesaffre & balbus ( 2007 ) , silvers ( 2008 ) , and lesaffre et al .",
    "these simulations are conducted in a shearing box with dimensions @xmath69 . as a check on the robustness of the main results and to verify their independence on the numerical implementation",
    ", some simulations were also performed with nirvana ( ziegler 1999 , papaloizou & nelson 2003 ) adopting a shearing box with dimensions @xmath70    the reference scale height is given by @xmath71 and thus corresponds to some prescribed isothermal sound speed @xmath72 or , equivalently , temperature @xmath73 .",
    "note that as the simulations considered here are not isothermal , @xmath72 need not necessarily correspond to the actual sound speed at any location or any time . in practice",
    ", however , it often approximates a volume average of the initial average sound speed ( for zeus runs ) or the sound speed under quasi - steady conditions ( nirvana runs ) .",
    "the box is periodic in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 direction and shearing periodic in the azimuthal @xmath76 direction ( see hawley et al .",
    "space is scaled by @xmath50 and time is measured in units of @xmath77 .",
    "density is measured in terms of the average mass density in the box @xmath78 , and magnetic field by the background field strength @xmath79 ( see below ) .",
    "finally , temperature is scaled by @xmath73 .",
    "the nirvana simulations employ a resolution of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the number of grid cells in the @xmath82th direction .",
    "this resolution level was adopted in fromang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and fromang ( 2010 ) and was there found to be converged .",
    "the zeus simulations , on the other hand , adopt a resolution of @xmath83 . though more demanding , because of the higher resolution in the direction of shear",
    ", the zeus simulations can take advantage of the numerical benefits of an isotropic grid ( lesaffre & balbus 2007 ) .",
    "additional runs were performed with the resolution reduced by a factor of two for both codes and these indicated no significant differences from the main results ( see section 5.4 ) .    in order to study simulations with a range of strengths of turbulent activity , three different magnetic field configurations ( and boundary conditions ) were implemented : fields with zero net - flux ( or zero vertical - flux ) , fields with net vertical - flux , and fields with net toroidal - flux ( see hawley et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the net field cases",
    ", we must stipulate the initial plasma beta of a run : @xmath84 where @xmath79 is the strength of the mean field penetrating the box and @xmath85 is the initial pressure .",
    "as @xmath86 decreases , simulations become more active and display larger effective values of @xmath2 . furthermore",
    ", the cases with net vertical and with net toroidal flux produce turbulence manifesting similar mean values of @xmath2 but with different characteristics ( hawley et al .",
    "this can give an indication of to what extent specification of the mean value of @xmath2 is sufficient to characterize the thermal equilibria .",
    "in the zero flux case , we set the initial vertical field to be of the form @xmath87 .",
    "however , provided @xmath79 is large enough for the mri to be resolved , the system attains a state after some 10 orbits that is independent of the initial condition ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .    for the diffusivities , we adopted parameters similar to those in fromang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) which compared results for zero flux simulations obtained from three codes , zeus , nirvana and the pencil code .",
    "these were found to be consistent and , in subsequent work of fromang ( 2010 ) , converged .",
    "we remark that fromang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that the level of mri turbulence critically depends on the magnetic prandtl number @xmath88 , i.e.  the ratio of kinematic viscosity to magnetic diffusivity . as a consequence , we set @xmath89 to ensure sustained activity , and take @xmath90    finally , in the case of nirvana ,",
    "the initial data was prepared from similar isothermal simulations to those carried out in fromang et al .",
    "heating and cooling is then ` switched on ' at a given time after a quasi - steady turbulent state is attained .",
    "the zeus runs begin from large amplitude perturbations which blend a large number of mri shearing waves , as calculated from the linear theory ( balbus & hawley 1992 ) . in this way",
    "a saturated turbulent state can be achieved relatively quickly and without an initial disruptive transient ( lesaffre et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested in thermal equilibria generated by models in which heating is provided directly through mri turbulence . accordingly , the cooling prescription must be implemented as an algorithm within our simulations .",
    "the values for @xmath1 that are input into the function @xmath39 ( see equations ( [ cooling ] ) and ( [ cool ] ) ) is taken to be the vertically averaged temperature in the box , @xmath91 and thus @xmath39 is a function only of @xmath74 , @xmath76 , and time .",
    "consequently , the cooling rate is the same for every @xmath75 at a given horizontal location @xmath92 .",
    "this is a natural consequence of using a one - zone cooling model of the type we have adopted .    as mentioned earlier , the governing equations that we numerically solve",
    "are scaled according to fiducial values for time , space , density , etc . however , when we evaluate the cooling function @xmath39 , we must convert back to physical dimensions .",
    "this means we need to specify explicit values for @xmath34 , @xmath73 , and @xmath0 .",
    "all calculations were carried out adopting an angular velocity @xmath34 corresponding to a keplerian circular orbit of radius @xmath93 cm around a star of mass @xmath94 .",
    "this choice corresponds to the outer regions of an accretion disc around a white dwarf and yield @xmath95 s@xmath96 ( flp83 ) .",
    "we explored , however , a range of values for the temperature scale @xmath73 and @xmath0 , over separate simulations , in order to sketch out the various thermal equilibria in the phase space of these variables .",
    "the values were chosen so that the simulation begins near an estimated point on an s - curve calculated from an alpha - disc model .",
    "once @xmath39 is calculated in dimensional units it is rescaled to simulation units and fed into the energy equation . in most cases ,",
    "simulations remain in the same phase space neighbourhood .",
    "however departures can occur in cases where there is a thermal runaway ( i.e. no nearby equilibrium ) . in some cases",
    "the box dimensions become mismatched to the physical conditions , at which point the simulation was terminated .    while @xmath73 and @xmath0 varied considerably , we employed two parameter sets for @xmath97 .",
    "the first set , corresponds to : @xmath22 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to these as ` set 1 ' .",
    "the second set was that adopted by flp83 : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "we refer to these as ` set 2 ' .",
    "we choose two sets to extend the range of possible disc states and also display the insensivity of our qualitative results to these parameters .",
    "of central importance in our simulations are the turbulent stresses which , via the transport of angular momentum , facilitate mass accretion and localised heating ( see balbus & papaloizou 1999 ) .",
    "we measure the stresses via the turbulent alpha : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the @xmath103 component of the total turbulent stress tensor and the angle brackets indicate a box average .",
    "this is a quantity that fluctuates in time , and thus must be distinguished from the ( constant ) shakura - sunyaev alpha parameter @xmath67 that is used in laminar disc modelling , defined through @xmath104 the two quantities should coincide once the turbulent alpha is averaged over long times .    the turbulent stresses @xmath102 extract energy from the orbital shear and ,",
    "once this energy travels down a turbulent cascade , it is thermalised by ohmic and viscous dissipation .",
    "this turbulent heating is captured directly in our model via the first two terms on the right side of . in a thermal quasi - steady state",
    "this heating rate @xmath9 must balance the radiative cooling rate @xmath39 .",
    "if this is not achieved the temperature of the system @xmath45 will evolve until a thermal balance is obtained .    in a steady state laminar disc the accretion rate @xmath24 is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the vertically averaged value of @xmath29 weighted by density . in a turbulent disc , the equivalent relation employing local averaged quantities is @xmath107 and , like @xmath2 , is a time varying quantity .",
    "we undertake numerical simulations of mri - induced turbulence for two sets of cooling parameters . for each parameter",
    "set we investigate three different magnetic configurations : ( a ) zero - net flux , ( b ) net - vertical flux , and ( c ) net - toroidal flux . and for each configuration we conduct a suite of separate simulations with various @xmath108 in order to sketch s - curves in each of the 6 cases .    in the net - vertical flux runs ,",
    "the initial plasma beta is @xmath109 .",
    "this large value is taken in order to minimise recurrent channel flows  an artefact of small boxes  that may skew our equilibrium results ( hawley et al .  1995 , sano & inutsuka 2001 , latter et al .",
    "for the net - toroidal flux , stronger fields were employed and the initial beta was either @xmath110 or @xmath111    once heating and cooling were activated , each simulation was run until the system had relaxed towards a turbulent thermal equilibrium , if one was nearby , or had monotonically heated up or cooled down so as to change solution branches ( cf .  the vertical arrows in fig .  1 ) . in the former cases , the relaxation time depended on the heating rate and hence the magnitude of the turbulent stresses . because of the small values of @xmath2 in the zero flux runs , this process could take some time and these runs were typically continued for between 150 and 250 orbits .",
    "the net toroidal - flux runs exhibited larger @xmath2 and a corresponding shorter heating time scale .",
    "they required 30 - 100 orbits to reach a quasi - steady states with meaningful statistics .",

    "for the first three simulations / panels , the surface density @xmath0 moves through increasing values , each of which permits a cool low - accreting equilibrium .",

    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] we plot s - curves for the various runs . these show the time - averaged temperature ( once thermal equilibrium is achieved ) as a function of surface density @xmath0 ( a conserved input parameter ) .",
    "the figures graphically summarise some of the data in tables [ table1]-[table4 ] . as in fig .  4 , the blue points with error bars represent the runs which were begun near a stable thermal equilibrium .",
    "the arrows represent ` thermally unstable ' runs , which were begun at the base of each arrow and were evolved to a state at the tip of each arrow , at which point the simulation either approached a stable branch or was stopped .",
    "first , the simulations reveal that the volume averaged temperature fluctuations in the turbulent equilibria are relatively small , some 10% , much smaller than for @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the thermal equilibria are in fact very stable : turbulent fluctuations are not so extreme as to push the system over the unstable intermediate branch in the @xmath283 diagram . in all the cases we simulate , equilibrium states never jump branches spontaneously . only at the ` corners ' of the s - curve",
    "is this a prospect . and on each corner the system could only move in one direction . as a consequence ,",
    "limit cycle behaviour should follow broadly along the lines predicted by the classical theory .",
    "the ` runaway ' simulations represent the system switching branches on account of the fact that no equilibrium state was available .",
    "the simulations that went from the vicinity of the lower to upper branches heated up at a rate @xmath284 , as expected .",
    "the simulations that left the vicinity of the upper branch cooled at a varying rate determined by @xmath39 . in some cases turbulence in",
    "the latter simulations died out once the volume averaged temperature in the box achieved a level much lower than the starting temperature @xmath73 .",
    "this is because the scale height in the box becomes so small ( of order the dissipation scale ) that the mri is suppressed .",
    "similarly , the physical condition of the gas becomes mismatched to the box size when the simulations catastrophically heat up .",
    "simulations in both cases were discontinued once this occurred .",
    "local simulations that begun near the s - curve ` corners ' would often bobble around indeterminately before switching curves . in these cases the system was near criticality and",
    "therefore small fluctuations in the heating rate change the stability of the system unceasingly . a sudden change in heating may cause the local equilibrium to vanish ; the gas heats up or cools only for the heating to readjust and the equilibrium state to reappear .",
    "it follows that in a limit cycle the branch jumping near branch ends can have a stochastic component .",
    "however , we reiterate we do not see such transitions between the _ central _ regions of the upper and lower branches .    superimposed upon the numerical s - curves are representative analytical s - curves derived from flp83 , in which @xmath67 is a user defined parameter .",
    "these @xmath67 values were chosen so that good agreement was obtained with the numerical equilibria on the lower branch .",
    "note , in particular , that once we set the analytic curves to match the lower equilibria , the upper numerical equilibria tend to exhibit slightly higher temperatures than expected from the analytic s - curves .",
    "quite generally , the upper numerical branch is better approximated by alpha models with larger @xmath67 values than required on the lower branches .",
    "this could reflect the fact that the effect of turbulent heating is not accurately described by the classical @xmath2 model given the run times of the simulations .",
    "however , it could also to some extent reflect a bias in the way the simulations were set up and carried out .",
    "a close study indicates that the turbulent @xmath2 weakly depends on the ratio of the average temperature @xmath285 to the reference temperature @xmath73 , or equivalently the mean scale height to the reference scale @xmath50 .",
    "very ` hot ' ( small ) boxes with @xmath286 exhibit a smaller @xmath2 , while ` colder ' ( large ) boxes yield larger @xmath2 , with relative differences @xmath287 .",
    "this is essentially a numerical effect arising from variations in the effective reynolds number and it can operate within any simulation . as a consequence , there is some low level indeterminacy in both the properties of the equilibrium solutions and the exact locations of the s - curve corners . their existence and gross properties , however , remain .",
    "another , less important , consequence of this ` alpha feedback ' is the larger amplitude and intermittent thermal fluctuations in the saturated turbulent states , as compared to isothermal models .",
    "we remark that the need for a branch - dependent @xmath288 in the context of @xmath2 disc modelling , was recognised early in order to obtain decent matching of outburst behaviour with observations ( smak 1984a , lasota 2001 ) .",
    "however , for the reasons mentioned above , caution should be exercised in the interpretation of our numerical local @xmath2 determinations in this context .",
    "finally , note that the levels of turbulence and values of @xmath2 increase with imposed toroidal or vertical magnetic flux .",
    "thus if the flux were to increase as a system transitioned from a low state to a high state , the higher state would be associated with a larger value of @xmath289 thus global disc simulations , for which net - flux need not be conserved locally , could potentially lead to such local @xmath2 variations .",
    "we compared the box averaged pressure ( and temperature ) with the turbulent stress in our quasi - steady equilibria . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we plot a representative evolution of these two fluctuating quantities .",
    "as is clear , on the orbital time - scale there only exists a weak dependence between pressure and the turbulent stress ( described by @xmath2 ) .",
    "there are three discrepancies .",
    "first , pressure _ lags behind _ the turbulent stress by roughly an orbit , which indicates that on short times the causal relationship is from viscous stress to pressure and not the other way around , in agreement with hirose et al .",
    "peaks in @xmath2 describe intense large - scale events , the energy of which subsequently tumbles down a cascade to reach dissipative scales .",
    "the gas heats up and the pressure increases .",
    "this process , however , is not instantaneous and the original @xmath2 signal is significantly modified ( ` smoothed - out ' ) by the time that it manifests itself as heating ( see pearson et al .",
    "2004 for similar results in forced isotropic turbulence ) .",
    "second , the volume averaged pressure and @xmath2 time series are dissimilar ; in particular , the volume averaged pressure appears at best as a heavily convolved version of @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , variations in @xmath2 are much larger than related variations in the volume averaged pressure , which are relatively mild , with the former @xmath29030% , and the latter less than @xmath291% .    , versus time and the volume averaged pressure versus time .",
    "parameters correspond to set 1 ; there is a net toroidal - flux associated with initial @xmath114 , and @xmath292 ( ub ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is clear that the latter tracks the stress imperfectly , with much of the short time scale stochastic variability seen in the stress washed out .",
    "gross features are also associated with a time - lag of about an orbit .",
    ", width=288,height=192 ]    this poor correlation between the viscous stress and pressure on short times casts doubt on the existence of thermal instabilities that rely on these two quantities to be functionally dependent ( shakura & sunyaev 1976 , abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) . indeed",
    ", numerical simulations of the mri in radiation pressure dominated discs reveal no thermal instability ( hirose et al .",
    "recently , linear stability analyses have been conducted that allow the pressure to lag behind stress , and vice - versa .",
    "these show that , despite this impediment , instability can in fact persist , especially with the short time - lags witnessed in our simulations ( lin et al .  2011 ; ciesielski et al .",
    "it would appear then that the main obstacle to instability in turbulent models of discs is due to something else , perhaps the stochastic nature of the viscous stress which is not faithfully reproduced in the behaviour of the volume averaged pressure ( janiuk and misra 2012 ) .    finally",
    ", note that over _ long _ times the turbulent stress @xmath102 and pressure _ are _ correlated .",
    "thus turbulent accretion on the hot upper branch of equilibria is greater than accretion in the colder states ( cf .",
    "section 5.1 ) .      finally , we briefly discuss issues associated with the numerics .",
    "parameter set 1 was primarily undertaken with zeus and parameter set 2 with nirvana , however the two codes were run on an overlap set of some 8 simulations .",
    "the comparison yielded good agreement in both @xmath121 and @xmath2 , with discrepancies within the range of the fluctuations .",
    "it follows that not only are our qualitative results robust with respect to parameter choices and magnetic configurations , they are robust with respect to numerical method .    in addition , we performed a short study in order to confirm that the simulations were adequately converged with respect to resolution and reynolds number .",
    "a representative sample of runs were taken and we evaluated the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath121 for different reynolds numbers while keeping the prandtl number constant and equal to 4 . in summary we found that doubling the kinematic viscosity @xmath29 ( halving the reynolds number ) led to changes in @xmath2 and @xmath121 that were less than @xmath293 .",
    "this reproduces the very weak reynolds number dependence uncovered by fromang ( 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , the result held whether we took 64 grid points per @xmath50 or 128 points .",
    "thus we were assured that these quantities were satisfactorily converged .",
    "next we kept the diffusion coefficients fixed and varied the resolution .",
    "we evaluated the above quantities at both 64 and 128 grid cells per @xmath50 .",
    "the lower resolution runs yielded slightly lower @xmath121 but the discrepancy was within @xmath294 .",
    "this small decline is understandable because at coarser resolutions more of the turbulent energy is removed by the grid and thus less captured by physical ohmic and viscous heating . as a consequence ,",
    "there is slightly less direct heating .",
    "that said , the effect is small and in general no greater than the statistical fluctuations of the runs .",
    "it leads in no way to any change in the qualitative behaviour exhibited .",

    "in addition , cylindrical mri simulations should be performed with the flp83 cooling prescription , anologous to the global @xmath2 disc calculation of papaloizou et al .",
    "such simulations would describe how real turbulence mediates the heating and cooling fronts that propagate through the disc during a transition between branches .",

    "in this appendix we detail how the cooling prescription of section 3.2 was derived .",
    "in particular we show how the effective temperature @xmath11 is calculated within each of the three important gas regimes introduced .",
    "the radiative cooling function can be written as a flux in the diffusion approximation by @xmath344 where @xmath345 in which @xmath4 is the opacity , @xmath346 is the stefan - boltzmann radiation constant and @xmath347 is the speed of light . setting the optical depth as @xmath348 we obtain the vertical component of @xmath349 in the form @xmath350 we integrate from near the disc surface where @xmath351 ( the effective temperature ) , and @xmath352 to the mid plane where @xmath353 , @xmath354 and @xmath355 thus we obtain @xmath356 where @xmath1 is the mid plane temperature .    in the hot optically thick regime 1 , @xmath357 and @xmath358",
    "so that ( [ thick ] ) implies @xmath359 where we have approximated @xmath360 to be constant and equal to its surface value @xmath361 this equation relates the effective temperature @xmath11 to the central temperature @xmath1 .    to complete the prescription we take the scale height to be @xmath362 and set the surface density to @xmath363 finally , as most of the optical depth arises from the regions near the midplane , we approximate eq .   by @xmath364 where @xmath61 is the opacity evaluated at the density @xmath62 and the midplane temperature @xmath54 in this hot ionised regime , we can approximate @xmath4 by the following formula : @xmath365 ( flp83 ) .",
    "so for specified @xmath34 , the above relationships enable @xmath11 ( and hence @xmath39 ) to be related to conditions in the mid plane , and hence @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this regime exhibits a cooler disc midplane that is still well ionised but surface layers that are @xmath366 k , and which are poorly ionised . as a result , near the photosphere",
    "@xmath4 not only drops significantly but becomes a steeply increasing function of temperature .",
    "it follows that the requirement @xmath367 at the photosphere determines the thermal structure of the disc , as in cool stars ( hayashi & hoshi 1961 ) . instead of ( [ thick1 ] )",
    "one must impose the condition @xmath368 , where @xmath56 is the optical depth at the location where @xmath369 .",
    "as the optical surface is @xmath370 above the mid plane , it converts to a relationship between the disc surface density @xmath11 and @xmath1 that leads to the central unstable part of the s - curve when thermal equilibria are considered .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath371 which we define through @xmath372 with @xmath373 being the opacity evaluated at the _ central _ density @xmath62 but with the photospheric temperature @xmath11 .",
    "it is anticipated that @xmath371 overestimates the optical depth of material above the disc photosphere @xmath56 by some factor of order unity .",
    "this factor we quantify through the dimensionless constant @xmath58 , so that @xmath374 once the dependence of @xmath373 on @xmath11 and @xmath62 is specified , equation supplies a means to obtain @xmath11 , and hence @xmath39 , when the disc is in regime 2 . finally , an approximate functional form of @xmath4 in this regime of incomplete hydrogen ionisation is @xmath375 ( flp83 ) .      in this regime",
    "the vertical structure of the disc is isothermal with @xmath376 .",
    "however , because the disc is optically thin in the vertical direction , @xmath360 is reduced from @xmath377 by a factor @xmath378 thus we set @xmath379 where @xmath59 is a dimensionless constant of order unity that takes account of appropriate frequency averaging and any other necessary corrections arising from a more complete discussion of radiation transport .",
    "this condition also connects @xmath11 to @xmath1 and @xmath0 . the central optical depth in this regime @xmath53",
    "is computed using eq .   and the opacity prescription introduced in eq .  .",
    "the prescription for @xmath11 is given in eq .",
    "for each of the three regimes . in numerical simulations one could switch from one form to the other according to the local value of @xmath1 ; we however employ an analytic interpolation of the three forms , as in flp83 . in eq .",
    ", the effective temperature @xmath11 takes one of three forms , which we denote by either @xmath380 or @xmath381 where the subscript indicates the associated regime .",
    "these three functions are then interpolated via the following : @xmath382 ^ 2},\\label{cool}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( flp83 ) .",
    "it is this algebraic expression for @xmath11 that is used in equation to evaluate @xmath39 .",
    "the two free parameters @xmath59 and @xmath58 can be chosen to fit results obtained from vertical integrations with standard local @xmath2 modelling . in fig .",
    "( a1 ) we plot the resulting functional dependence of @xmath11 on the central temperature @xmath1 with the three regimes indicated on the curve . in regimes 1 and 3 the effective temperature increases steeply with central temperature , while in the transitional regime 2 the dependence is very weak on account of the rapid changes in opacity near the surface . in this intermediate regime",
    "the radiative cooling rate is very ` flat ' and , consequently , thermal instability ensues ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) .     as a function of central temperature @xmath1 as determined from the flp83 cooling prescription , cf .  eq .  .",
    "parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in addition , we have indicated on the curve which regime is dominant.,width=336,height=240 ]"
