    "pion photo- and electroproduction is presently one of the main sources of our information on the structure of nucleons and nuclei . with the advent of the new generation of high intensity , high duty - factor electron accelerators as jefferson lab ( newport news ) , mami ( mainz ) and elsa ( bonn ) , as well as modern laser backscattering facilities as legs ( brookhaven ) and graal ( grenoble )",
    ", this field reaches a new level of promise .",
    "the elementary amplitude of pion photo- and electroproduction on free nucleons is one of the main ingredients of the analysis of these reactions for nuclei .",
    "it has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies , and over the past 30 years a series of models was developed for photon energies from threshold up to 500 mev ( see for example refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "attempts to extend these models to energies up to around 1 gev , by use of effective lagrangians and coupled channels approaches , have been presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite . unfortunately , most of the recent models are too sophisticated and complicated and difficult to handle for nuclear applications .",
    "a simple and effective model for nuclear calculations was developed in the late 70 s by blomqvist and laget  @xcite .",
    "it provided an adequate description of then available experimental data up to the first resonance region .",
    "however , in the mean time modern electron accelerators have provided a host of new high precision data .",
    "beams of high current and high duty - factor have reduced the statistical errors to the order of a few percent , and the new data have provided us with high quality multipole analyses of pion photoproduction from vpi @xcite and mainz  @xcite .    with such advances",
    "it is certainly appropriate to develop new models for the description of pion photo- and electroproduction .",
    "with respect to nuclear applications , these models should have a simple and physically transparent form . on the other hand",
    "they should satisfy gauge invariance and unitarity , and reproduce the existing experimental data , not only in the first but also in the second and third resonance regions , for both pion photo- and electroproduction , which are the subject of the current interest .",
    "it is therefore the aim of this work to develop a model having these properties .    as a starting point",
    "we will use the prescriptions of the isobar model  @xcite , assuming that resonance contributions in the relevant multipoles have breit - wigner forms .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the @xmath7 vertices will be determined via the corresponding helicity amplitudes or quark multipole moments  @xcite .",
    "the nonresonant contributions will be described using standard born terms with a mixed pesudovector - pseudosclar @xmath8 coupling and vector meson exchange .",
    "the final amplitude will be unitarized by extending the procedure developed by olsson  @xcite and laget  @xcite to the case of virtual photons and higher resonances .",
    "finally we demonstrate that such an extremely economical model provides a good description for individual multipoles as well as differential cross sections and polarization observables .",
    "we believe that the developed model can be used not only for nuclear applications , but also as a starting point to predict and analyze forthcoming data for pion photo- and electroproduction on proton and neutron targets .",
    "in the following we will briefly summarize the most important expressions which clarify the conventions used in our paper .",
    "for details we refer to , e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "in accordance with ref.@xcite we decompose the current operator in the @xmath9 @xmath10 frame into the standard cgln amplitudes @xmath11",

    "the eight amplitudes @xmath19 are complex functions of three independent variables , e.g. the total energy @xmath15 , the pion angle @xmath20 , and the four - momentum squared of the virtual photon , @xmath21 . due to current conservation",
    "we obtain the two relations @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "they are connected with the longitudinal ones by @xmath35 .    from total isospin conservation in the pion - nucleon system",
    "it follows that the amplitudes @xmath11 ( or the multipoles ) can be expressed in terms of three independent isospin amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these are @xmath36 for the isoscalar photon , and for the isovector photon the two amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the @xmath9 system with total isospin @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "however , it is also useful to define the proton @xmath41 and neutron @xmath42 amplitudes with total isospin 1/2 , @xmath43 with this convention the physical amplitudes for the four physical pion photo- and electroproduction processes are @xmath44\\,,\\qquad",

    "there are 16 different polarization observables for the reactions with real photons . in pion electroproduction",
    "we have four additional observables due to the longitudinal amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 and 16 observables due to longitudinal - transverse interference , giving a total number of 36 polarization observables . in the literature there occur many different definitions for these observables . in our work",
    "we shall mainly follow the convention of ref.@xcite . in the case of comparison with experimental data presented in different conventions",
    ", we will give special comments .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the main goal of our present work is to develop a simple model for nuclear applications , which should be consistent with the recent data for pion photo- and electroproduction on nucleons at photon energies ( or equivalent energies ) up to 1 gev .",
    "this energy range covers the first and second , and touches the third resonance regions .",
    "the base line for a correct description of the resonance contributions is , of course , a reliable description of the nonresonant part of the amplitude ( nonresonant background ) .",

    "( 5 - 6 ) we have included explicitly @xmath6 dependent proton ( @xmath53 ) , neutron ( @xmath54 ) and pion ( @xmath55 ) electromagnetic form factors . in the case of real photons",

    "we express the nucleon form factors in terms of the sachs form factors by the standard dipole form , and assume that @xmath58 which is the simplest way to preserve gauge invariance . in the same way we treat the axial form factor @xmath59 .",
    "the description of the hadronic @xmath8 system is a more sophisticated part of the theory of pion photo- and electroproduction . in this case",
    "there are two possibilities for the construction of the interaction lagrangian , the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , @xmath60 and the pseudovector ( pv ) , @xmath61 @xmath8 coupling , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . at low pion energies",
    "the pv coupling is to be preferred , because it fulfills pcac and is consistent with low energy theorems ( let ) and chiral perturbation theory to leading order .",
    "however , the pv model can not be renormalized in the usual way , and this produces a problem at high energies . on the other hand , the renormalizable ps model leads to a better description at the higher photon energies . in our work",
    "we consider both of these schemes by a gradual transition between them .",
    "the final expressions for the cgln amplitudes @xmath24 , obtained using the effective lagrangians ( 5 - 8 ) are well - known ( see , for example ref.@xcite )",
    ". we will refer to them as _ born term contributions_. they are the dominant part of our background .",
    "the other part is related to _",
    "vector meson exchange contributions_. in general they are much smaller , but as we will show below they are quite important for some multipoles .",
    "the effective lagrangians for @xmath64 and @xmath65 exchange are  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the @xmath64 and @xmath65 meson field operators respectively , and @xmath67 is the radiative coupling determined by @xmath68 decay . the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath69 is defined using a dipole form factor .    in general the values for the strong coupling constants @xmath70 ( vector coupling ) and @xmath71 ( tensor coupling ) in eq .",

    "the off - shell behaviour of the vertex functions is described by hadronic monopole form factors , @xmath74      from the considerations above we find that the following ingredients for the construction of the background are not well defined : 1 ) the type of the @xmath8 coupling and 2 ) the coupling constants for the vector meson exchange contributions .",
    "the best way to fix them is to analyse nonresonant @xmath75- and @xmath76-wave multipoles . in our energy region",
    "these are @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . at photon",
    "@xmath79 energies @xmath80 mev , the multipole @xmath81 can also be considered as nonresonant .",
    "first , let us fix the coupling constants of the vector mesons .",
    "for this purpose we consider the multipoles which are independent of the type of the @xmath8 coupling .",
    "these are @xmath82 and @xmath78 , of which the first one ( @xmath83 ) is especially sensitive to @xmath64 exchange contributions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the final results for the coupling constants and cut - off parameters @xmath84 are given in table 1 .",
    "the real parts of the nonresonant multipoles @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the isospin @xmath87 channel are more appropriate to fix the optimum parametrization for the @xmath8 coupling . in fig .",
    "2 we have depicted their energy dependence obtained with ps ( dotted curves ) and pv ( dashed curves ) couplings . in the threshold region the best description of recent analyses from vpi  @xcite and mainz  @xcite can be obtained within a pv model . as pointed out before , this coupling has also to be preferred on general grounds , because it reproduces the leading terms of chpt near threshold . however , at larger photon energies ( @xmath88 mev ) the results of the vpi group are in between our calculations with pv and ps couplings . in such a situation , in order to describe @xmath89 and @xmath90 multipole in a wide energy range up to @xmath91 gev , the most economical way is to construct a _",
    "hybrid model _",
    "( hm ) with a mixed type of @xmath8 coupling .",
    "in order to give a reasonable threshold behavior , it has to start with pure pseudovector coupling at the lowest energy and will develop into pseudoscalar coupling at the highest energies .",
    "the simplest effective lagrangian for such a model may be written in the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the asymptotic pion momentum in the @xmath9 @xmath10 frame which depends only on @xmath15 and is not an operator acting on the pion field . from the analysis of the @xmath90 and",
    "@xmath89 multipoles we have found that the most appropriate value for the mixing parameter is @xmath94 mev . we note that for the pion pole terms the pion couples with on - shell nucleons only , and hm , pv and ps models are all equivalent .",
    "moreover , only the multipoles @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are affected by changing the coupling schemes .",
    "one of the important peculiarities of the @xmath85 multipoles is the relatively large imaginary part , even at low pion energies .",
    "the origin of this feature is well - known : pion - nucleon rescattering ( or final @xmath9 interaction ) . in order to take account of this effect",
    ", we shall use a prescription in accordance with unitarity ( fermi - watson theorem ) and k - matrix approach , i.e @xmath97 where @xmath98/2i$ ] is the pion - nucleon elastic scattering amplitude with the phase shift @xmath99 and the inelasticity parameter @xmath100 ( both taken from the vpi analysis ) .    in fig .",
    "2 ( solid curve ) we see that the unitarity condition ( 13 ) combined with our lagrangian ( 12 ) provides an excellent description of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath89 multipole in a wide energy range . in fig .",
    "2 we illustrate similar results for the case of isospin 1/2 and @xmath101 mev . in the next section we will describe the analysis of the latter channel for the higher energies in connection with @xmath3 resonance excitation .    finally we note that in the charged pion channels the multipole @xmath85 is not sensitive to different choices of the @xmath8 coupling and contributions of pion rescattering . however , these effects are extremely important in the neutral channels for both the @xmath85 and @xmath102 multipoles . in the latter case",
    "we predict a large imaginary part that certainly has to be taken into account in future analyses of the @xmath103 reaction , e.g. , in the transverse - longitudinal ( tl ) cross section , where the nonresonant @xmath104 multipole interferes with the large resonant @xmath105 multipole .",
    "the background contributions being fixed , we can develop a reliable scheme to study baryon resonances by analyzing the relevant multipoles . however , it is well - known ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , that even in this case the procedure for the extraction of the `` bare '' resonance contributions is not trivial due to the interference with the background . in the present work we generally consider so - called `` dressed '' resonances which include `` bare '' resonances and vertex corrections due to the interference with the background .",
    "we believe that for nuclear applications this is a more appropriate way to facilitate the investigation of medium effects . on the other hand",
    ", the k - matrix approach asserts that at resonance position the contribution from the interference term is small or even vanishing in the case of an ideal resonance .",
    "therefore , we expect to get reliable informations about the conventional resonance parameters at the position of the resonance .",
    "first we consider pion photoproduction .",
    "for the relevant multipoles @xmath106 we describe the resonance contributions assuming a breit - wigner energy dependence of the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the usual breit - wigner factor describing the decay of the @xmath109 resonance with total width @xmath110 , partial @xmath9-width @xmath111 and spin @xmath112 , @xmath113^{1/2}\\,,\\qquad k_w=\\frac{w^2-m_n^2}{2w}\\,.\\ ] ] the factor @xmath114 is @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the isospin 3/2 and isospin 1/2 multipoles respectively , as defined by eq .",

    "the total width @xmath110 in eqs.(14 - 15 ) is the sum of @xmath111 and the `` inelastic '' width @xmath124 . for the latter one",
    "we assume dominance of the two - pion decay channels and parametrize the corresponding energy dependence as in ref.@xcite , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the momentum of the compound ( 2@xmath127 ) system with mass @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath122 . concerning the definition of @xmath124",

    "we parametrize the @xmath15 dependence of the @xmath132 vertex beyond the resonance peak with a form factor @xmath136 where the damping parameter @xmath118 is the same as in eqs.(16 - 17 ) and @xmath137 at @xmath122 . in order to preserve the correct `` pseudothreshold '' behaviour , mainly given by the born terms",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath138 , with @xmath139 the orbital angular momentum of the photon",
    ".    one important ingredient of the breit - wigner parametrization ( 14 ) is the unitary phase @xmath140 .",
    "the main role of this parameter is to adjust the phase @xmath51 of the total multipole ( background plus resonance ) to the corresponding pion - nucleon scattering phase @xmath141 ( in accordance with the fermi - watson theorem , when the influence of the inelastic channels is small ) or to the experimentally observed phase .",
    "the latter procedure will become necessary when the photon energy increases above 500 mev , the approximate limit of the fermi - watson theorem .    for the most important @xmath142 resonance ( @xmath143 and @xmath144 multipoles ) ,",
    "the influence of the inelastic channels is negligibly small up to @xmath145 mev . in this region @xmath146 with very good accuracy . at the higher energies , where the @xmath147 contribution becomes small , we will use the ansatz  @xcite @xmath148\\,.\\ ] ] the pion - nucleon scattering phases @xmath149 and inelasticity parameters @xmath150 are taken from the analysis of the vpi group ( said program ) .",
    "then , applying the unitarization procedure developed by olsson  @xcite and laget  @xcite , we can determine the phase @xmath151 .",

    "we apply the same procedure to the @xmath152(1440 ) resonance and the corresponding multipoles @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "however , in this case the influences of the inelastic channels on the pion photoproduction phase become important already at @xmath155 mev , and they are different in the proton and neutron channels . in this situation",
    "we define @xmath151 by using the results of the vpi analysis .    in the second and third resonance regions the most important resonances are the @xmath3 contributing to the @xmath156 multipole , the @xmath2 with contributions to the @xmath157 and @xmath158 multipoles , and the @xmath4 with contributions to the @xmath159 and @xmath160 multipoles . in the isospin 3/2 channel",
    "the most important resonance is the @xmath5 which contributes to the @xmath161 and @xmath162 multipoles .",
    "unfortunately , for all these multipoles little information is available about the phases beyond the resonance peak .",
    "therefore , in these cases we consider @xmath140 a free parameter that we take as a constant extracted from the observed ratio between the imaginary and real parts at the resonance peak .",
    "the final results for the more important multipoles and the corresponding values for the resonance parameters are presented in figs .",
    "4 - 6 and tables 2 - 3 , respectively .",
    "we note that the @xmath132 vertex at resonance is described by the two helicity amplitudes @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",

    "we compare our results ( solid curves ) for differential cross sections , photon ( @xmath165 ) and target ( @xmath166 ) asymmetries with the recent dispersion relation analysis of mainz  @xcite ( dashed curves ) , and with old and new data from bonn and mainz in the first resonance region .",
    "one can see that our model describes the observables in this region at the same level of accuracy as dispersion relations .",
    "moreover , in this energy region our model can be extremely simplified by keeping only contributions from @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances , and the calculations with pure pv @xmath8 coupling and with our hybrid model differ very little .    in figs .",
    "9 - 12 we present our results ( solid curves ) for the differential cross sections and single polarization observables at @xmath155 mev , where the contributions from the second and third resonance regions become increasingly important .",
    "our complete model generally agrees well with the experimental data in the @xmath167 channel over a wide energy region up to 1 gev .",
    "however , there is one exception , the differential cross section at 700 mev . from fig .",
    "4 we can see that this is the region where the @xmath3 resonance has a maximum contribution due to a cusp effect",
    ". in this region calculations without the @xmath168 resonance ( dashed curves ) describe the data better . in the @xmath169 channel",
    "we could only obtain a satisfactory agreement with the data up to @xmath170 mev .",
    "unfortunately , the data sets of different groups are not consistent in that channel , and the error bars are much bigger than in the case of the data at lower energies .    in fig .",
    "13 we demonstrate the evolution of the energy distribution in the @xmath167 channel at backward angles by subsequent addition of resonance contributions to the born terms .",
    "first , we see that the large contribution from ( non unitarized ! ) born terms is strongly suppressed by the @xmath147 resonance .",
    "the second interesting feature is related to the excitations of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 resonances . at @xmath171",
    "their contributions are comparable and it is difficult to separate them . however , at @xmath172 the contribution of the @xmath2 resonance is very small , because the @xmath173 multipole vanishes at this kinematics .",
    "this fact provides a possibility to study the contribution from the @xmath3 resonance and the related cusp effect due to the opening of the @xmath174 channel , clearly separated from @xmath2 effects .",
    "the major problem in the extension of our model to the case of virtual photons is associated with the determination of the @xmath6 dependence of the amplitudes @xmath175 at the resonance peak . for the main @xmath176 amplitude",
    "we define this dependence by @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the usual dipole form factor . the parameter @xmath179 will be determined later .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( 21 ) an additional @xmath6 dependence appears due to the kinematical factor @xmath180 , with the virtual photon three - momentum @xmath181    at present time there is only little experimental information available on the @xmath6 dependence of the small @xmath144 and @xmath182 multipoles .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we therefore assume that the corresponding electromagnetic amplitudes have the same @xmath6 dependence as @xmath176 , @xmath183 of course , this assumption will have to be checked whenever more information about the @xmath184 and @xmath185 ratios will be available from the new experiments .",
    "the extension of the unitarization procedure to the case of pion electroproduction is straightforward for the @xmath147-resonance , because the fermi - watson theorem requires that the phases of the total @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath182 multipoles should not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the position of the resonance peak does not depend on @xmath6 either . in our model",
    "this important requirement is satisfied by an appropriate choice of the phase @xmath140 in eq .",
    "we note that after the unitarization procedure this phase will depend not only on @xmath15 but also on @xmath6 . in this way we always obtain resonance multipoles with real parts vanishing at the resonance position @xmath186 mev and with the total phases of the multipoles equal to 90@xmath187 . in fig .",
    "14 we give our predictions for the @xmath143 and @xmath144 multipoles at @xmath6=0 , 0.2 , and 1.0 ( gev / c)@xmath188 which satisfy this requirement .",

    "only little information is available on the multipole @xmath153 related to the excitation of the roper resonance @xmath1 . in our analysis as well as in many other ones , we neglect the contributions from longitudinal resonance excitations , because of a lack of any reliable data .",
    "moreover , an analysis of the existing exclusive and inclusive electroproduction data  @xcite showed no indication of an excitation of the roper resonance at high @xmath6 .",
    "this implies a rapid fall - off of the corresponding proton helicity amplitude @xmath134 with @xmath6 .",
    "however , such a result would be at variance with numerous quark model calculations .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we take the @xmath6 dependence of the electromagnetic amplitude @xmath202 at resonance ( @xmath203 mev ) in the form @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the harmonic oscillator parameter of quark model calculations whose value varies from @xmath206 gev , which reproduces the proton charge radius , to @xmath207 gev , which fits the @xmath135 helicity amplitude for the @xmath208 resonance  @xcite . beyond the resonance peak we introduced an additional @xmath6 dependence in the form factor @xmath209 using the usual prescription , replacing @xmath210 and @xmath211 .    due to the importance of the inelastic channels , we can no longer apply the fermi - watson theorem to the @xmath152 resonance as well as to resonances in the second and third resonance regions . as in the case of real photons",
    "we will assume that the real part of the multipoles vanishes at resonance , i.e. @xmath212 independent of @xmath6 .",
    "as a consequence of eq .",
    "( 14 ) , the phase @xmath140 becomes a @xmath6 dependent function .",
    "the procedure of finding @xmath213 at resonance we will again call _",
    "unitarization procedure_.    as may be seen seen in fig .",

    "( 25 ) , leading to a rapid fall - off with @xmath6 . in the non - unitary approach , where @xmath198=const , the @xmath6 dependence is smoother and the real part of the @xmath153 multipole has a large negative value at resonance . in fig .",
    "16 we illustrate the effect of unitarization also for the proton helicity amplitude @xmath134 which is related to the amplitude @xmath202 by @xmath214 for the harmonic oscillator parameter we have taken the value @xmath215 gev .",
    "with such a value our unitarization procedure works up to @xmath6=1 ( gev / c)@xmath188 , while smaller values of @xmath205 limit applicability to smaller momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the pion electroproduction amplitudes in the second and third resonance regions has been defined in accordance with refs.@xcite , where @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 resonances are considered the dominant states of the @xmath216_1 $ ] and @xmath217_2 $ ] super multiplets in an @xmath218 symmetry scheme . within this model the transitions between the nucleon and its resonances are expressed in terms of the quark electric and magnetic multipoles @xmath219 and @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the photon helicity , @xmath222 and @xmath223 or @xmath224 are the orbital and total angular momenta , depending on the multipolarity of the transitions .",
    "as in most other analyses of the experimental data , we neglect the contributions from the longitudinal ( or coulomb ) transitions assuming that the corresponding quark multipoles @xmath225 and @xmath226 vanish .    our choice",
    "to express the @xmath6 dependence in terms of the quark multipole moments is motivated , first , by their simple connection with the amplitudes @xmath133 listed in table 5 .",
    "second , as we will see below , the quark multipole moments exhibit a very simple @xmath6 dependence .",
    "the third advantage is that by this way we can obtain both proton and neutron amplitudes .",
    "as may be seen in table 5 we have assumed a certain deviation from the predictions of the @xmath227 symmetry in the case of the neutron amplitudes in order to match with our values for the corresponding helicity amplitudes at the photon point , leading to a 10% increase for the @xmath2 , a 10% decrease for the @xmath4 and 30% decrease for the @xmath3 resonances .    in terms of the quark multipoles the experimental data have been compiled by burkert et al.@xcite in the form @xmath228 for the transition to the @xmath216_1 $ ] super multiplet describing the excitation of the @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 resonances , and @xmath229 for the transition to the @xmath217_2 $ ] super multiplet describing the excitation of the @xmath4 resonance . in order to minimize relativistic effects ,",
    "the @xmath6 dependence is evaluated in the equal velocity frame ( evf ) with @xmath230    the @xmath6 dependence of the so - called _ reduced quark multipole moments _ @xmath231 and @xmath232 is parametrized similarly as in ref.@xcite with a slight modification in order to match with the amplitudes @xmath133 of table 3 ( or the helicity amplitudes of table 4 ) at the photon point . for the transition to the @xmath216_1 $ ] super multiplet",
    "we obtain @xmath233 for the transition to the @xmath217_1 $ ] super multiplet the parametrization is @xmath234 note that in eqs .",

    "17 and 18 we demonstrate the consistency of our parametrization with the reduced quark multipole moments and helicity amplitudes compiled by burkert  @xcite .",
    "note that for the second @xmath240 resonance we followed the assumption of ref.@xcite , @xmath241 where the @xmath242 mixing angle matches our value for the helicity amplitude at the photon point .",
    "the unitarization procedure for the excitation of the @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 resonances is similar to the procedure for the @xmath1 resonance , i.e. we assume that the total phase @xmath243 at @xmath122 is independent of @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "19 we compare the @xmath6 dependence for the more important proton electric and magnetic multipoles at resonance to the results of the analyses from desy , nina and bonn , compiled by foster and hughes  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of the @xmath152 resonance , our unitarization procedure for these multipoles does not seriously modify the original @xmath6 dependence of the quark multipole moments , as can be seen by comparing the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "19 .    in the following figs .",
    "20 - 23 we present some examples for observables of @xmath244 and @xmath245 electroproduction . in general the results of our model",
    "are in good agreement with the existing data .",
    "in particular we note that our results obtained without @xmath1 resonance contribution get closer to the data with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates a strong decrease of @xmath246 as function of @xmath6 .",
    "we hope that future experimental studies will clarify these problems occurring for the roper resonance contribution .",
    "furthermore a precise @xmath247 separation would be very useful in order to obtain more information about the @xmath6 dependence of the @xmath248 multipoles .",
    "finally , we comment on the @xmath249-channel resonances which are often present in effective lagrangian approaches . obviously , the main subject of experimental and theoretical studies are the @xmath75-channel resonances , while the contributions from the tails of the @xmath249- channel resonances are just slowly varying backgrounds which are essentially real and affect all the multipoles .",
    "we assume that the @xmath249-channel contributions are effectively included in the unitarization procedure and the nonresonant background of our model .",
    "more sophisticated methods beyond the isobar model of our work will demand an explicit inclusion of the @xmath249-channel resonances in a crossing symmetric way .",
    "we have developed a new operator for pion photo- and electroproduction for applications to reactions on nuclei at photon equivalent energies up to 1 gev .",
    "the model contains born terms , vector mesons and nucleon resonances up to the third resonance region ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) .    for the born terms we propose an energy dependent superposition of pseudovector and pseudoscalar @xmath8 couplings .",
    "this procedure describes the correct energy dependence of the nonresonant multipoles for photon @xmath79 energies up to @xmath91 gev , in particular in the case of the @xmath250 and @xmath251 multipoles , and provides an excellent agreement with the results of the mainz multipole analysis at photon energies below 500 mev and with the vpi analysis at higher energies .",
    "the resonance contributions in the @xmath75-channel are parametrized by the standard breit - wigner form for the relevant multipoles .",
    "unitarity is fulfilled by multiplying the resonance terms with appropriate phases .",
    "we find that the unitarization procedure developed for pion electroproduction is very important for extracting the @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath252 resonance multipoles , especially for small @xmath6 . in the case of the @xmath1 resonance , we assume that the phase of the total @xmath153 multipole is independent of @xmath6 at resonance which leads to a suppression of the roper resonance with increasing values of @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the electromagnetic form factors for the @xmath168 , @xmath208 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 resonances is expressed in terms of quark multipole moments , attributing the first three states to the @xmath216 $ ] and the last state to the @xmath255 $ ] multiplets .",
    "the assumption of a @xmath6 independent phase at resonance leads only to a small modification of the @xmath6 dependence of the helicity amplitudes in these cases .    within our model",
    "we obtain good agreement with the existing experimental data for pion photo- and electroproduction on the nucleon . due to its inherent simplicity , the model is well adopted for predictions and analysis of future results on pion electroproduction on nucleons and nuclei .",

    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 201 ) .      in this appendix ,",
    "we give the @xmath15 and @xmath6 dependence for the phases @xmath256 in the breit - wigner parametrization obtained after the unitarization procedure .",
    "first , let us consider the @xmath15 dependence at the photon point @xmath6=0",
    ". in this case our results for the phases of the magnetic , electric and longitudinal components of the @xmath0 resonance can be parametrized by @xmath257 where @xmath258(100 mev ) .",
    "all phases are given in degrees .",
    "for the phases of the proton and neutron components of the magnetic excitation of the @xmath1 resonance we have @xmath259 the longitudinal excitation of the roper resonance is neglected in our model . for the other resonances we assumed the phases @xmath260 to be constants as listed in table 3 .",
