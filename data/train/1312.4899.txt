    "the shape of the two - point correlation function of the observed galaxy field , or of its fourier - transform the power spectrum , contains features such as baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the turn - over marking the transition between radiation dominated and matter dominated evolutionary phases @xcite .",
    "these features can be used to place tight constraints on relative abundances of different energy - density components of the universe ( radiation @xmath12 , dark matter @xmath13 , baryonic matter @xmath14 and de @xmath15 ) .",
    "presently , these ratios are measured to much higher accuracy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , for most cosmological models these features provide most information when used as a standard ruler .",
    "if the universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large - scales , the correlation function and power spectrum should likewise be rotationally invariant .",
    "the observed two - point statistics instead exhibit a strong anisotropy with respect to the line - of sight ( los ) direction .",
    "two effects are responsible for this apparent anisotropy : the redshift - space distortions ( rsd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the alcock  paczynski effect ( ap ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rsd arise in maps made from galaxies if distances are determined from measured redshifts assuming that they are only caused by the hubble flow .",
    "because of gravitational growth , the galaxies tend to infall towards high- density regions , and flow away from low - density regions , such that the clustering is enhanced in the los direction compared to the perpendicular direction .",
    "the observed redshifts thus have a component aligned with these flows . on large - scales where gravitational growth is",
    "linear , measuring the relative clustering in both los and transverse directions leads to a measurement of the logarithmic growth rate of structure @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a scale factor , @xmath18 is a measure of the amplitude of the matter power spectrum and @xmath19 is the linear growth function normalized such that @xmath20 ( see * ? ? ? * for a review of rsd ) .",

    "galaxy clustering data measures the growth at low redshifts . combining this information with the accurate estimates of the amplitude of matter perturbations at @xmath22 provided by cmb allows for extremely strong constraints for deviations from the predictions of general relativity ( gr ) since even small changes in the growth of structure accumulate to a large offset over cosmic time ( for recent gr constraints see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "anisotropies are also observed due to the ap effect , which stems from the fact that we need to convert observed angular positions and redshifts of galaxies to physical coordinates in order to measure clustering statistics .",
    "if the fiducial cosmology used for this mapping is different from the true cosmology this will induce anisotropies in the measured clustering pattern even in absence of rsd .",
    "angular distortions are sensitive to the offset in the angular distance @xmath23 and distortions in the los direction depend on the offset in @xmath24 . measuring the ap effect provides accurate estimates of the angular distance and hubble parameter and can be used to constrain properties of de ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most of the information on @xmath27 usually comes from the most pronounced feature in the correlation function  the position of the bao peak in the monopole .",
    "it is therefore convenient to report results in terms of @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the sound horizon at the drag epoch which sets the bao scale ( for a review of bao and ap see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the rsd signal within the correlation function is difficult to model because of the significant contribution from nonlinear effects and higher order contributions from galaxy bias .",

    "the third weight corrects for the missed galaxies due to fibre collisions and redshift failures using the algorithm described in @xcite .",

    "since these effects are statistically independent , the total weight is a product of three @xmath63 .",

    "the optimal choice of binning for the correlation function measurements depends on two competing effects . using small bin size retains more information , but",
    "since we estimate covariance matrices by computing a scatter of finite number of mock catalogues ( see section  [ sec : covariances ] ) , using more bins deteriorates the precision at which the elements of the covariance matrices can be estimated .",
    "empirical tests performed on the mock catalogues suggest that the rsd signal is more or less insensitive to the binning choice , while the bao measurements are optimal at @xmath66 mpc ( for details see * ? ? ?",

    "figure [ fig : gcshape ] displays the posterior likelihood of @xmath272 obtainable from _ dr11 _ data alone .",
    "the likelihood surface does not close even within @xmath273 of the cmb constraints .",
    "previous studies either fix the shape parameters to their cmb best - fit values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , let @xmath274 vary and fix the rest ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , or marginalise over them by taking a prior centered around cmb best - fit values ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we adopt a different approach and apply the cmb shape prior to our galaxy clustering likelihood .",
    "since later we will combine our results with planck data to obtain constraints on de and mg parameters one may be led to an erroneous impression that the cmb data is being double - counted .",
    "we demonstrate below that this is not the case .",
    "let @xmath275 be a cmb likelihood , where @xmath17 are shape parameters and @xmath139 are other parameters that may be related to de and gravity parameters of interest [ @xmath276 .",

    ". for simplicity , assume @xmath17 , @xmath139 and @xmath278 to be scalars and that all likelihoods are multivariate gaussian .",
    "this demonstrates that direct combination of galaxy clustering and cmb data always produce stronger constraints on derived parameters and therefore the galaxy clustering measurements obtained by assuming a cmb prior on the shape can be combined with the cmb data without double counting the information ."
