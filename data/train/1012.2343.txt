    "with the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing in neutrino oscillation experiments , leptogenesis @xcite has become the most attractive model of baryogenesis to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this can be expressed for example in terms of the baryon - to - photon number ratio and is very well measured by cmb observations @xcite to be [ etabobs ] _",
    "b^cmb = ( 6.2 0.15)10 ^ -10 .",
    "leptogenesis originates from the see - saw mechanism @xcite that is based on a simple extension of the standard model where right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with a majorana mass matrix @xmath15 and yukawa couplings @xmath16 to leptons and higgs are added . within @xmath0 models , three rh neutrinos @xmath17",
    "( @xmath18 ) are nicely predicted and for this reason they are traditionally regarded as the most appealing theoretical framework to embed the seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , within the simplest set of assumptions inspired by @xmath0 models @xcite , barring strong fine - tuned degeneracies in the rh neutrino mass spectrum and using the experimental information from neutrino oscillation experiments , the traditional @xmath19-dominated leptogenesis scenario predicts an asymmetry that falls many orders of magnitudes below the observed one @xcite .",
    "this is because , within @xmath19-dominated leptogenesis , where the spectrum of rh neutrinos is hierarchical and the asymmetry is produced from the decays of the lightest ones , successful leptogenesis implies a stringent lower bound on their mass @xcite , @xmath20 . on the other hand , @xmath0 grand - unified theories typically yield , in their simplest version and for the measured values of the neutrino mixing parameters , a hierarchical spectrum with the rh neutrino masses proportional to the squares of the up - quark masses , leading to @xmath21 and therefore to a final asymmetry much below the observed one .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that , when the production from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos @xcite and lepton flavour effects @xcite are simultaneously taken into account @xcite , the final asymmetry can be generated by the decays of the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos and allowed regions in the low energy neutrino parameter space open up .    in this paper",
    "we proceed with the analysis of @xcite and present the resulting constraints on all low energy neutrino parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the current experimental status on low energy neutrino parameters , we set up the notation and describe the general procedure to calculate the the asymmetry and find the constraints . in section 3 we first consider the case already studied in @xcite , when the dirac basis and the charged lepton basis coincide and then , in section 4 , we allow for a misalignment between the two bases not larger than that one described by the ckm matrix in the quark sector .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present a global scan in the space of parameters where all possible cases between the case of no misalignment and the case of a misalignment at the level of the ckm matrix are taken into account .",
    "we also discuss two scenarios , one at small @xmath22 and one at large @xmath22 , and show how , within @xmath0-inspired models , minimal leptogenesis could be tested in future low energy neutrino experiments .",
    "notice that our discussion is made within a non - supersymmetric framework .",
    "recently a study of @xmath0-inspired models within a supersymmetric framework has also enlightened interesting potential connections with lepton flavour violating decays and dark matter @xcite .",
    "an analysis of leptogenesis within left - right symmetric models , where a type ii seesaw contribution to the neutrino mass matrix is also present , has been performed in @xcite . within these models ,",
    "the minimal type i scenario considered here represents a particular case recovered under specific conditions .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , a dirac mass term @xmath23 , is generated by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath24 gev of the higgs boson . in the see - saw limit , @xmath25 , the spectrum of neutrino mass eigenstates splits in two sets : three very heavy neutrinos , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively with masses @xmath28 almost coinciding with the eigenvalues of @xmath15 , and three light neutrinos with masses @xmath29 , the eigenvalues of the light neutrino mass matrix given by the see - saw formula @xcite , m_= - m_d1d_mm_d^t , that we wrote in a basis where the majorana mass matrix is diagonal defining @xmath30 .",
    "the symmetric light neutrino mass matrix @xmath31 is diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , that , in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , can be identified with the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments measure two neutrino mass - squared differences . for no one",
    "has @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the two heavier neutrino masses can therefore be expressed in terms of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath22 as [ m2m3nor ] m_2 = , m_3 = , where we defined @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "recently , a conservative upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses , @xmath39 , has been obtained by the wmap collaboration @xcite combining wmap 7 years data plus baryon acoustic oscillations observations and the latest hst measurement of @xmath40 . considering that it falls in the quasi - degenerate regime",
    ", it straightforwardly translates into [ upperbound ] m_1 < 0.19ev ( 95% cl ) .",
    "we will adopt the following parametrization for the matrix @xmath32 in terms of the mixing angles , the dirac phase @xmath41 and the majorana phases @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite @xmath44 and the following @xmath45 ranges for the three mixing angles @xcite [ twosigma ] _ 12= ( 31.3 ^ -36.3^ ) , _ 23= ( 38.5 ^ -52.5^ ) , _ 13= ( 0 ^ -11.5^ ) . in the case of io the expression of @xmath46 in terms of @xmath22 becomes [ m2m3inv ] m_2 = , while the expression for @xmath47 does not change . with the adopted convention for the light neutrino masses , @xmath48 , the case of io corresponds to relabel the column of the leptonic mixing matrix performing a column cyclic permutation ,",
    "explicitly @xmath49 the predicted baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath50 is related to the value of the final @xmath51 asymmetry @xmath52 by @xcite [ etab ] _ b 0.9610 ^ -2 n_b - l^f , where @xmath53 is the @xmath54 number in a co - moving volume that contains on average one rh neutrino @xmath55 in thermal ultra - relativistic equilibrium abundance ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "this is clearly a conservative condition , since the asymmetry gets enhanced when @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",

    "the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are actually irrelevant for the determination of the final asymmetry ( unless @xmath77 is unrealistically large to push @xmath79 from @xmath80 above the lower bound @xmath81 gev to achieve successful @xmath19 leptogenesis ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath82 is relevant to set the scale of the mass @xmath83 ( valid for @xmath84 ) of the next - to - lightest rh neutrino mass , but it does not alter other quantities crucial for thermal leptogenesis , such as the amount of wash - out from the lightest rh neutrinos .    defining the flavoured @xmath85 asymmetries as _ 2-_2-_2 _",
    "2+_2 , these can be calculated using @xcite [ eps2a ] _ 2 \\ { im+ } , where ( x)=x and @xmath86 is the decay rate of the rh neutrino @xmath1 into the flavor @xmath87 with couplings given by the yukawa s matrix @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume an initial vanishing @xmath1-abundance instead of an initial thermal abundance as in @xcite .",
    "in this way , a comparison of the results in the two analyses gives a useful information about the dependence of the final asymmetry on the initial @xmath1 abundance when successful leptogenesis is imposed .",

    "the total decay parameters are then just simply given by @xmath91 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the quantities @xmath92 .    from the decay parameters",
    "one can then calculate the efficiency factors that are the second needed ingredient , together with the @xmath85 asymmetries , for the calculation of the final asymmetry .",

    "the @xmath0-inspired conditions @xmath97 , yield a rh neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath98 , though , as we already noticed , this spectrum is obtained for a broader range of @xmath99 values . in this situation ,",
    "the asymmetry is dominantly produced from @xmath1 decays at @xmath100 in a two flavour regime , i.e. when final lepton states can be described as an incoherent mixture of a tauon component and of coherent superposition of a an electron and a muon component .",
    "therefore , at the freeze - out of the @xmath1 wash - out processes , the produced asymmetry can be calculated as the sum of two contributions , [ nbmltm2 ] n_b - l^t~m_2 _ 2(k_2,k_2)+ _",
    "2e+(k_2,k_2e+ ) , where @xmath101 stands for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "at @xmath107 the coherence of the @xmath108 quantum states breaks down and a three flavour regime holds , with the lepton quantum states given by an incoherent mixture of @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 flavours .",
    "the asymmetry has then to be calculated at the @xmath19 wash - out stage as a sum of three flavoured contributions .",
    "the assumption of an initial vanishing @xmath1-abundance allows to neglect the phantom terms in the muon and in the electron components @xcite so that the final asymmetry can be calculated using the expression n_b - l^f",

    "notice that successful leptogenesis relies on points in the parameter space where one out of the three @xmath112 . from this point of view the constraints on low energy neutrino experiments that we will obtain should be quite stable against effects that could enhance the asymmetry such as a resonant enhancement for special points where @xmath113 .",
    "such effects are however still able to relax the lower bound on @xmath114 and on the @xmath115 , since the @xmath116 s do not depend on @xmath114 .",
    "we start from the case @xmath117 that has been studied already in @xcite deriving constraints in the plane @xmath118 for no . here",
    "we show constraints on all low energy neutrino parameters , including the case of io .",
    "let us first discuss the case of no . in fig .  1 we plotted the final asymmetry @xmath50 for the same three sets of values of the involved parameters as in the fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where these three choices were corresponding to three different kinds of solutions for successful leptogenesis .",
    "+   +   +   +    this time the third solution ( right panel ) , is suppressed and successful leptogenesis is not attained . in @xcite ,",
    "this was the only solution corresponding to a final asymmetry dominantly in the muon flavour instead than in the tauon flavour ( as for the first two ) .",
    "the suppression that we find now is explained partly because we are adopting a correct determination of the phases in the @xmath58 matrix ( cf .",
    "( [ dphi ] ) ) and partly because we are now assuming an initial vanishing @xmath1-abundance instead than an initial thermal one .",
    "we will see however that , allowing for @xmath119 , this kind of solution will again yield successful leptogenesis in some allowed regions of the parameter space , characterized in particular by large values of @xmath120 .",
    "the solution in the central panel is also partly suppressed and successful leptogenesis is not attained .",
    "however , in a parameter scan , we find that this kind of solution can still give successful leptogenesis for slightly different values of the parameters than those indicated in the figure caption . in this case",
    "the difference with respect to the results in @xcite is explained just in terms of the different assumption on the initial abundance .",
    "this dependence on the initial conditions is due to the fact that @xmath121 , i.e. the solution falls in the weak wash - out regime at the production .    finally , the first solution ( left panel ) is fully unchanged .",
    "it therefore exhibits a full independence of the initial conditions and this is in agreement with the fact that it respects all the necessary conditions for the independence on the initial conditions found in @xcite .",
    "notice that these conditions also enforce an efficient wash - out of a possible pre - existing asymmetry .",
    "a scan in the space of parameters confirms that these three solutions obtained for special sets of values are actually representative of the three general kinds of solutions that come out and , therefore , the drawn conclusions apply in general .    in the panels of figure 2",
    "we show the results of such a scan that highlight the allowed regions in the parameter space projected on different two - parameter planes .",
    "+   +    the scatter plots have been obtained scanning the three mixing angles @xmath122 and @xmath6 over the @xmath123 ranges eqs.([twosigma ] ) , the three phases @xmath124 over the ranges @xmath125 $ ] and the absolute neutrino mass scale for @xmath126 .",
    "these ranges also coincide with those shown in the plots , except for @xmath22 where the plots are for @xmath127 simply because no allowed solutions have been found for lower values .",
    "the shown results have been obtained in two steps .",
    "a first scan of @xmath128 points has yielded a first determination of the allowed regions . with a second scan of additional @xmath129 points , restricted to the excluded regions",
    ", we have then more robustly and sharply determined the contours of the allowed regions .",
    "notice that these regions have no statistical significance and the random values of the parameters have been generated uniformly .    in the top left panel the three rh neutrino masses are plotted versus @xmath22 .",
    "we have also plotted the lower bound on the reheating temperature calculated as [ trhmin ] t_rh^min .",
    "this calculation relies on the fact that in the case @xmath117 the solutions , as we commented , always fall in a tauon @xmath1-dominated scenario .",
    "it can be seen that the lowest bound is given by @xmath130 that in a supersymmetric version , if unchanged , would be marginally reconcilable with the upper bound from the gravitino problem @xcite .",
    "this is another reason to extend our investigation to cases with @xmath119 in next sections .    in the top central panel",
    "we have then plotted the allowed region in the @xmath118 plane that can be compared with an analogous figure in @xcite . here",
    ", however , we show only those points that respect the condition @xmath131 but for 2 different values of @xmath132 ( in @xcite we were only showing points for @xmath133 ) .",
    "the ( red ) star represents a point found for a minimum value @xmath134 .",
    "this point basically roughly indicates where the maximum of the asymmetry occurs in the parameter space for a fixed value of @xmath135",
    ". we will continue to use this convention ( yellow circles for @xmath133 , green squares for @xmath136 and red stars for minimum found @xmath135 value ) throughout the next figures .",
    "the structure of the allowed region in the @xmath118 plane can be understood as follows . since @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    ", we immediately deduce that a large lepton asymmetry in the tau flavor may be produced only for sufficiently large values of @xmath22 .",
    "this is rather easy to understand .",
    "if @xmath22 tends to zero , we go into the so - called decoupling limit , @xmath139 .",
    "as the @xmath85 asymmetry needs ( at least ) two heavy states to be generated at the one - loop level , and disregarding the contribution from the @xmath19 , @xmath140 must vanish .",
    "the wash - out parameter @xmath141 is @xmath142 @xcite and therefore the final baryon asymmetry may be estimated to be _",
    "b510 ^ -3_2 5 ( ) 10 ^ -10 , which requires m_1()^210 ^ -3ev , for no .",
    "this estimate holds if the wash - out from the interaction with @xmath19 is negligible , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath143 .",
    "of course , the smaller is @xmath22 , the smaller @xmath144 needs to be . for @xmath145 ev , the only possibility is that @xmath144 is significantly below unity .",
    "extending the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds [ pp ] s_13(-2 ) > 0.04 . to get the feeling of the figures involved , we may set @xmath146 and find that the wash - out mediated by the @xmath19 s vanishes for an experimentally allowed value of the mixing between the first and the third generation of lh neutrinos , @xmath147 in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "if @xmath22 is larger than @xmath148 ev , then @xmath149 is allowed and @xmath6 can be taken to be vanishing .",
    "notice also that the lower bound eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) on @xmath6 increases with @xmath150 .",
    "this nicely reproduces the linear dependence emerging from the numerical results in the _ left column middle panel _ for the plane @xmath151 and that is described , roughly for @xmath133 and more accurately for @xmath136 , by [ linear ] _ 2344^+4(_13 - 7^ ) , represented with a dashed line in the panel . in the _ top right panel _ we show the allowed region in the plane @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath85 non conserving terms in neutrino oscillation probabilities can be expressed in terms of the _ jarlskog invariant _ @xmath153 given by @xcite j_cp & = & im[u_3u_e 2u_2^u_e3^ ] + & = & c_12s_12c_23s_23c^2_13s_13 , such that p___-p_|_|_= 4j_cp_k > js_;kj(m^2_kjl2e ) , where @xmath154 . in the bottom left panel we show the allowed points in the plane @xmath155 .",
    "it can be noticed that a non zero value of @xmath153 is not crucial .",
    "looking at the bottom - central panel , it is interesting to notice that the allowed regions for the majorana phases are centered approximately around @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",

    "one can see how there is a precise relation between @xmath160 and @xmath22 , given approximately by @xmath12 .",
    "it can be also noticed that there is quite a strict lower bound @xmath161 .",
    "lowest values @xmath162 are the most favoured ones in this case .",
    "though current planned experiments will not be able to test the full allowed range , it is still interesting that they will test it partially , tightening the constraints on the other parameters as well .",
    "we have also made an interesting exercise .",
    "we determined the constraints without making use of any experimental information on the mixing angles and letting them just simply variate between @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ thijarb ] .",
    "first , notice that the lower bound on @xmath22 relaxes of a few orders of magnitude ( see left panel ) .",
    "then notice quite interestingly that small values @xmath165 are well allowed for @xmath166 but values @xmath167 would have been very marginally consistent .",
    "therefore , the current bound @xmath165 seems to match quite well with successful @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis    on the other hand , values @xmath168 would have been more optimal for @xmath165 than the current experimental large atmospheric values ( see the central panel in the figure ) . however , they are still allowed thanks to the observed range of values of the solar neutrino mixing angle ( see the right panel ) . for the solar neutrino mixing angle",
    "there is no real favourite range of values for @xmath165 .",
    "let us now discuss the results for io .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in grand unified models with conventional type i seesaw mechanism one can always find , for any no model satisfying the low energy neutrino experimental constraints , a corresponding io model . therefore ,",
    "though they exhibit some unattractive features that quite strongly disfavour them ( e.g. instability under radiative corrections ) , io models within grand unified theories are not unequivocally excluded .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to check whether the requirement of successful leptogenesis can somehow provide some completely independent information .",
    "we repeated the same scan performed in the case of no and the results are shown in figure  [ constrio ] , the analogous of the figure  [ constrno ] for the no case .",
    "one can see that io is only very marginally allowed . for @xmath133 , there is only a small region at large values of @xmath169 . extending the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is explained by the fact that the wash - out parameter @xmath144 turns out to be k_110 ^ 3evm_atm , while in the no case @xmath144 was proportional to @xmath170 .",
    "this constrains @xmath171 to be as large as possible , thus ruling out small values of @xmath22 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in this case the allowed values for @xmath7 lie in the second octant and correspond to the largest ones compatible with the current experimental limits .",
    "the allowed values of the effective neutrino mass fall in a narrow range , @xmath172 .",
    "+   +    therefore , io will be in any case fully tested from cosmology and @xmath159 experiments during next years .",
    "we will see that this conclusion will hold also allowing @xmath119 . as usual , in the plots the red star corresponds to the minimum value of @xmath135 for which we have found a solution , @xmath173 .",
    "the corresponding set of values indicates approximately where the asymmetry has a maximum for a fixed @xmath135 value .    for this choice of values , in figure  [ io ] , we show the plots of the rh neutrino masses , of the asymmetry @xmath50 , of the @xmath85 asymmetries @xmath174 , @xmath175 , of @xmath176 and of @xmath177 versus @xmath22 .",
    "+    one can see how the heaviest rh neutrino mass @xmath178 decreases with @xmath22 much faster and at @xmath179 one has @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , as one can see from the central top panel , the @xmath85 asymmetries are this time strongly suppressed at @xmath181 . on the other hand , in the range @xmath182",
    "the @xmath85 asymmetries are large enough that successful leptogenesis is still possible .",
    "notice , that this kind of solutions are a sort of modification of the solution obtained at large @xmath22 values for no , simply shifted at somehow larger values .",
    "the asymmetry is therefore strongly depending on the initial conditions ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the first kind of solution , at small @xmath22 values , is completely absent .",
    "therefore , though io is strongly disfavoured , it is not completely ruled out , a conclusion somehow very similar to that one obtained from completely independent arguments @xcite . in this case",
    ", however , leptogenesis provides quite a precise quantitative test .",
    "we can conclude this section saying that these results confirm and complete those shown in @xcite .",
    "in particular it is confirmed that there are viable solutions corresponding to the different points shown in the figures falling in the currently experimentally allowed ranges of the parameters , .",
    "the model is therefore not ruled out .",
    "a further step is now to understand whether the model is predictive , excluding regions of the parameter space that future experiments can test . from the figures , as we have discussed ,",
    "it is clear that assuming @xmath117 such excluded regions exist and therefore one obtains interesting constraints .",
    "however , it is important to go beyond the simple condition @xmath117 in order to test the stability of the constraints for variations of @xmath59 .",
    "this is the main objective of the next sections .",
    "we now study how the constraints change when a misalignment between the physical basis where @xmath66 is diagonal and the flavour basis , where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , is considered , corresponding to @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath59 is unitary , we can parameterize it similarly to the leptonic mixing matrix introducing three mixing angles , one dirac - like phase and two majorana - like phases , @xmath185 where we defined @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , we have now six additional parameters that give much more freedom .",
    "we will not explore the full parameter space but , in the spirit of @xmath0-inspired models , we will allow only small mixing angles @xmath188 at the level of the mixing angles in the ckm matrix .    as a first definite example we repeat the analysis performed for the case @xmath117 for a definite case where the @xmath189 are exactly equal to the mixing angles in the ckm matrix and therefore we set @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , where the latter is the measured value of the cabibbo angle .      for no the results are shown in figure 6 .",
    "+   +    there is a first result to highlight : @xmath135 values as low as @xmath193 are now allowed .",
    "this is an interesting result in connection with the study of realistic @xmath0 models . at the same time",
    "this result also implies slightly lower values of @xmath114 and consequentially of the minimum value of @xmath194 that can be now as low as @xmath195 , as it can be noticed in the top - left panel in fig .",
    "6 . in this case",
    "we have more generally calculated the minimum reheat temperature as [ trhmin2 ] t_rh^min , considering that in the case the asymmetry at the production can be either tauon dominated or @xmath108 dominated .",
    "this is because the third kind of solution that was highly suppressed in the case @xmath117 , the right panel in fig .  1 , becomes now viable and is @xmath108 dominated , as we will discuss soon in more detail .",
    "notice that if we compare the allowed points for @xmath136 with those found for @xmath117 , the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters are now less stringent .",
    "in particular an allowed region for values @xmath196 is also found for very small values of @xmath6 . indeed , in the case @xmath117 , and for small values of @xmath22 , the suppression of the wash out value @xmath144 imposed a lower bound on @xmath6 . by choosing @xmath197 introduces the possibility of getting vanishing @xmath144 even for zero @xmath6 angles . extending the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds indeed that one configuration where @xmath144 is smaller than unity is attained if @xmath198 ( mod @xmath199 ) and @xmath200\\,[m_{\\rm sol}^4/(m_2 ^ 3\\ , m_3)]\\sim -(5/12)(m_{\\rm sol}/m_{\\rm atm})\\sim -10^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this implies @xmath201 ( mod @xmath199 ) , as confirmed by our numerical results .",
    "including in the analysis the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle , as one can see from the panel with the constraints in the @xmath151 plane , only values @xmath202 for @xmath165 are allowed for @xmath203 .",
    "notice that , for @xmath204 , the allowed region in @xmath205 only marginally overlaps , at small values of @xmath7 , with the region for the case @xmath117 .",
    "this means that a measurement of these three quantities can distinguish between the two cases , @xmath117 and @xmath197 , and not all combinations of these three quantities seem to be possible",
    ". we will be back on this point in the next section .",
    "in figure 7 we plotted the relevant quantities for three particular choices of the parameters , as indicated in the figure caption , corresponding to the three kinds of solutions found for @xmath197 .",
    "+   +   +   +    these three sets of values correspond to the three kinds of solutions that are found in the scan plots .",
    "the first two sets , corresponding to the left and central panels , give a tauon dominated asymmetry , while the third set , corresponding to the right panels , yields a muon dominated asymmetry .",
    "notice that these three kinds of solutions are the same three kinds , with slight modifications , found for the case @xmath117 .",
    "however , one can see that this time the third kind of solution , where the final asymmetry is muon dominated , also yields successful leptogenesis .",
    "the major difference that explains this result , is that for @xmath197 the flavoured @xmath85 asymmetries @xmath175 are not as hierarchical as in the case @xmath117 , as it can be clearly seen in the three panels showing the @xmath85 asymmetries in figure 7 .",
    "we have also repeated , as for the case @xmath117 , the exercise to leave the mixing angles completely free , without imposing any experimental constraint finding the results shown in fig .",
    "[ thijarb2 ] .",
    "one can see that in this case the points found when the current experimental constraints are imposed ( the green points ) fall in more marginally allowed regions , also for @xmath6 .",
    "this might suggest that @xmath117 seems to be a more attractive case than @xmath197 .",
    "finally , we also present in figure  9 the constraints obtained for io . even though there is again a remarkable suppression of the allowed regions compared to no , they are somehow less restrictive than for @xmath117",
    ". in particular now a broader range of values for @xmath22 is allowed and @xmath7 can be as low as @xmath206 for @xmath204 .",
    "+   +    this is also confirmed by the fact that lowest allowed value is now @xmath207 , much lower than in the case @xmath117 ( it was @xmath208 .",
    "however , it is still fair to say that the io case is only marginally allowed and certainly disfavoured compared to the no case .",
    "the two specific cases that we discussed , @xmath117 and @xmath197 , suggest an interesting sensitivity of @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis to slight deviations of @xmath59 from the identity .",
    "this sensitivity was absent in the results found in @xmath19-dominated leptogenesis @xcite . in this way",
    "it seems that one could even gain some information on @xmath59 from low energy neutrino experiments .",
    "however , there is a potentially dangerous aspect of such a sensitivity : if for a slight variation of @xmath59 the entire space of low energy neutrino parameters becomes accessible , then any chance to test @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis is lost . on the other hand , from a comparison of the results obtained for the two definite cases , @xmath117 and @xmath197 , one can understand that this does not happen .",
    "one can still suspect that for a continuous variation of the parameters in @xmath59 , such that @xmath59 changes from @xmath117 to @xmath197 , new solutions appear so that any point in the space of the low energy neutrino parameters can be obtained for a proper choice of @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we study this issue .",
    "we perform a global continuous scan of the parameters for @xmath59 between @xmath117 and @xmath197 .",
    "obviously a precise limit @xmath197 for such a global scan is somehow arbitrary .",
    "it should be therefore taken as a working assumption defining @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis , even more than the condition @xmath97 that , as we stressed many times , should not be regarded as a very restrictive assumption .",
    "clearly within well defined realistic @xmath0 models , more specific conditions on @xmath59 should be obtained . in any case one expects that if the @xmath59 satisfies the condition @xmath209 , then the allowed values for the low energy parameters should fall in the allowed regions for @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis .",
    "therefore , in this section we present the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters for a continuous variation of the values of the mixing angles @xmath188 in the range @xmath210 ( i.e. for @xmath209 ) .",
    "more explicitly the shown scatter plots are obtained for the low energy neutrino parameters scanned over exactly the same ranges as for the case @xmath117 .",
    "the three angles in @xmath59 are scanned over the ranges @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , while the three phases are scanned over @xmath125 $ ] . in order to determine the allowed regions ,",
    "we have followed the same strategy as in the case @xmath117 , with a similar total number of scanned points , @xmath214 .",
    "the results for no are shown in figure  10 .",
    "one can see how the allowed regions are approximately given by a super - position of those found for @xmath117 and @xmath197 plus all intermediate solutions .",
    "the result is that now the correlations among the parameters found in the two special cases seem to disappear .",
    "there are however still interesting non trivial constraints .",
    "what clearly survives is that the allowed points still cluster within two distinguished ranges of values for @xmath22 , one range at small values , @xmath215 , and one range at high values , @xmath216 , a distinction that is sharp for @xmath217 ( green squares ) while it is softer for @xmath133 ( yellow circles ) .",
    "+   +   +    at the same time one can see that a global scan actually shows a slight correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath6 in the low @xmath22 range while the interesting linear dependence between @xmath6 and @xmath7 found for @xmath117 seems now to be lost .",
    "however , it should be considered that these plots are projections on two - parameters planes of an allowed region in a seven - parameter space .",
    "therefore , only a full multi - parameters analysis would be able to unreveal correlations involving more than two parameters .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to the distinct analysis that we carried out for the two special cases @xmath117 and @xmath197 , one can catch sight of an interesting correlation among @xmath22 , @xmath218 , @xmath6 and @xmath160 . to this extent , this time we have also plotted the constraints in the plane @xmath219 , showing how the lower bound on @xmath160 increases with @xmath6 .      in order to find out whether the linear dependence between @xmath6 and @xmath7 found for @xmath117 ( cf .",

    "( [ linear ] ) .",
    "notice that inside this region there are still sort of sub - regions that seem to be excluded .",
    "we can summarize these results saying that , at low values of @xmath5 , there is an interesting testable constraints in the plane @xmath151 given by the relation eq .",
    "( [ th13th23 ] ) .",
    "in particular experiments that are already taking data such as the nuclear reactor experiment double chooz @xcite and the long baseline experiment t2k @xcite have the capability of a @xmath223 discovery of values @xmath224 .",
    "our results seem to suggest that if such high @xmath6 values will not be found , then a restricted range of values for @xmath7 is predicted . for example , if @xmath225 then @xmath226 , and if @xmath227 then @xmath202 .",
    "such a constraint on @xmath7 should be also tested during next years with quite a good accuracy by the t2k experiment @xcite .",
    "these constraints in the plane @xmath151 should be considered at this level indicative , and should also consider that they are quite sensitive to the value of @xmath135 .",
    "notice that at the same time , cosmological observations and/or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments should also be able to test the condition @xmath228 .",
    "it should be therefore appreciated that this scenario will be tested during next years .",
    "it is also interesting to notice ( see right panel in fig .",
    "11 ) that there is a linear dependence between @xmath160 and @xmath6 as well . in particular , for @xmath229 , at large values @xmath230 one has @xmath231 and even for @xmath224 one has @xmath232 .",
    "these values for @xmath160 are below the sensitivity of future planned experiments ( @xmath233 ) such as exo @xcite . however",
    ", at least , @xmath160 can not be arbitrary small but has a lower bound that , for sufficiently large @xmath6 values , is @xmath234 times below the currently planned reachable experimental sensitivity , a very small value but maybe not completely hopeless .    within the two - parameter analysis we are presenting , we can not draw sharper predictions but is seems quite plausible that from a more involved multi - parameter analysis precise correlations could emerge , maybe also involving the solar neutrino angle @xmath218 . in this respect",
    "the central panel in figure  11 suggests that the solar mixing angle could indeed play also a role and that maybe sharper predictions in the 3 parameter space @xmath235 exist .",
    "we can also study how the allowed regions would reduce requiring large values @xmath236 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  12 .",
    "one can see that in this case one obtains very clear    constraints that will allow to test this scenario during next years in a quite unambiguous way .",
    "first of all from the fig .  10 , thanks to the very precise values of the majorana phases , one can notice that there is a very clear relation between @xmath22 and @xmath160 .",
    "second , one can see from the left panel of fig .",
    "12 how there is an upper bound @xmath13 for @xmath229 . for values of @xmath237",
    ", one has even @xmath238 .",
    "it should be said however that at these large @xmath22 values , one typically obtains a final asymmetry that depends on the initial conditions .",
    "since we are assuming vanishing initial @xmath1 abundance and vanishing initial asymmetry , these constraints should be regarded as the most stringent ones , but likely also the best motivated ones .",
    "finally , we repeated the global scan for io as well and the results are shown in fig .  13 .",
    "+   +   +    one can see how the allowed regions somehow merge those found for the two extreme cases @xmath117 and @xmath197 .",
    "there is therefore nothing really new .",
    "io is quite strongly constrained and it will be fully tested in next years .",
    "in particular we can notice again how there is a clear lower bound on @xmath7 rather than an upper bound as in no .",
    "more particularly , one can notice that the allowed region in the plane @xmath152 is approximately described by [ m1th23io ] _",
    "2343^+12^(0.2ev / m_1 ) ( the dashed line in the upper right panel ) .",
    "it is then quite interesting that @xmath0 inspired leptogenesis is able to distinguish no and io even at @xmath11 , when the same values of @xmath160 and of @xmath239 ( the quantity tested by cosmological observations ) are found both for io and for no . from this point of view",
    "@xmath0 inspired leptogenesis provides a way to solve this ambiguity .",
    "we have derived constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters from @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis .",
    "our investigation shows that even minimal leptogenesis , based on a type i seesaw mechanism and assuming a thermal production of the rh neutrinos and with a traditional high mass scale rh neutrino spectrum , can be testable within a well motivated framework , where the see - saw parameter space is restricted by the @xmath0-inspired conditions .",
    "the role played by the @xmath1 decays is crucial in this respect , not only in re - opening the viability of these models .",
    "the presence in the @xmath1-dominated regime of a double stage , a production stage and a lightest rh neutrino wash - out stage , seems to introduce , as shown simultaneously both by the numerical and by the analytical results , a strong direct dependence on neutrino mixing angles as well , in addition to the dependence on the absolute neutrino mass scale , already found in usual @xmath19-dominated leptogenesis @xcite .      in the significant case of no with low @xmath22 values",
    ", the neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass seems to be too small to be measured but not arbitrary small and in any case future experimental results can be anyway useful to restrict the allowed regions for the other parameters and sharpening the predictions .",
    "the results for @xmath119 seems also to be sensitive to @xmath59 itself and they therefore suggest that there is an opportunity to gain information on it , an interesting point within studies of specific @xmath0 models .",
    "it is quite interesting that there is an allowed region in the parameter space that allows large values of @xmath6 testable with on - going reactor neutrino experiments and that for these large values the models favours either large or small @xmath7 values depending whether @xmath5 or @xmath240 .    in the small @xmath22",
    "range it is also interesting that the constraints are completely independent of any assumption on the initial conditions , a point that maybe makes this option more attractive .",
    "it is actually quite interesting that this conclusion is also supported by completely independent and general considerations based on the possibility to reproduce , without a particularly fine tuned @xmath58 matrix , the observed atmospheric to solar neutrino mass ratio , @xmath241 , starting from hierarchical neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "it is found @xcite that this experimental observation is far more natural if the lightest neutrino presents a much stronger hierarchy than the the two heavy ones , as it occurs in the region that we have found at small @xmath22 .",
    "it should be also stressed again , that since our results are independent of @xmath78 and @xmath77 , as far as @xmath242 and @xmath243 , they hold even for a yukawa couplings hierarchy milder than in the case of up quark masses .",
    "this can help to make even more natural to reproduce the result @xmath241 without a fine tuned @xmath58 .",
    "a more precise measurement of @xmath218 could also play a relevant role in testing these models , a point that should be addressed by a more involved multi - parameter analysis .",
    "a future accurate determination of the neutrino mixing angles will be therefore crucial to test @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis and could even yield some interesting information on the matrix @xmath59 . in conclusion",
    ", it seems that @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis provides an interesting well justified example that gives some hopes about the possibility of testing minimal leptogenesis even only with low energy neutrino experiments",
