    "observations of the curvature perturbation in the universe strongly suggest that it is generated during inflation by the gravitational production of particles .",
    "the field , whose quantum fluctuations are responsible for the particle production is typically considered to be a scalar field ; one of the many flat directions that are envisaged in theories beyond the standard model .    very little has ever been discussed about gravitational production of vector fields during inflation ( see refs .",
    "this is mostly because , to achieve particle production in a de - sitter background , the field in question must be light enough for its compton wavelength to extend beyond the horizon .",
    "however , a massless vector field is conformally invariant and , therefore , it does not couple to the inflating gravitational background , which means that it does not undergo particle production . hence , vector field generation during inflation has been ignored .    in this work",
    "i investigate the possibility that a vector field with non - zero mass undergoes indeed particle production during inflation .",
    "my motivation was originally the possibility that a small , albeit non - zero , mass may lead to something interesting .",
    "however , i have found that this is not a promising direction , as it is shown below .",
    "nevertheless , i have discovered that a negative mass - squared comparable to the hubble scale can indeed result to the desired scale - invariant superhorizon spectrum of perturbations .",
    "in contrast to previous work @xcite the vector field considered is not assigned to the task of driving inflation .",
    "this is so in order to avoid generating a large scale anisotropy , which is otherwise inevitable ( see , however , ref .",
    "the curvature perturbations are produced in the same spirit as in the curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "thus , it is assumed that the vector field is subdominant during inflation .",
    "consequently , particle production gives rise to isocurvature perturbations , which turn adiabatic at some point after inflation if the vector field manages to dominate the universe before its decay .",
    "what i find is that an oscillating massive vector field does not result in a large scale anisotropy even when it dominates the universe .",
    "therefore , a vector field can indeed realise the curvaton scenario .    throughout the paper i use natural units , where . the signature of the metric is ( 1,-1,-1,-1 ) .",

    "then it is evident that the equation assumes the same form as the case of @xmath41 and , therefore , the results are identical to the previous section . however , in the opposite case , when , the equation becomes @xmath42 \\delta\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\cal a$}^\\parallel\\simeq 0\\ , , \\label{long}\\ ] ] which , in fact , is identical to the equation of motion for a perturbation of a light scalar field in a de - sitter background .",
    "the solution of the above , after matching to the vacuum in eq .",
    "( [ match ] ) , is of identical form to eq .",
    "( [ solu ] ) with the crucial difference that , this time @xmath43 thus , the dominant contribution to the power spectrum is again given by eq .",
    "( [ paperp ] ) .",

    "( [ paflat ] ) for extremely light fields .",
    "parameterising the scale dependence of the perturbations in the usual manner @xmath46 we obtain for the spectral index the result @xmath47 which is the usual finding in the case of a light scalar field .",
    "the similarity between the longitudinal component of a massive vector field to a scalar field can be understood if one considers that the mass of the vector field is due to the higgs mechanism , in which case the longitudinal component corresponds to the scalar degree of freedom ( the goldstone boson ) which has been `` consumed '' by the vector field in the higgs process .",
    "however , we should also note here that , in the limit of the longitudinal component of the vector field becomes unphysical .",
    "( the superhorizon spectra of @xmath41 and @xmath40 in the case when are shown in figure  1 . )    thus , we see that a light vector field may indeed obtain an almost scale invariant superhorizon perturbation spectrum , through its longitudinal component . however , the price to pay is that the condition has to be satisfied throughout the superhorizon evolution of the perturbations in question .",
    "this means that , for the cosmological scales , we must satisfy the constraint @xmath48 where ` * ' denotes the epoch when the cosmological scales exit the horizon during inflation and ` end ' denotes the end of inflation , while @xmath49 corresponds to the number of remaining e - foldings of inflation . for the cosmological scales we have and also , typically .",
    "hence , we find that the mass of the vector field has to be . such an extremely light field can not decay before nucleosynthesis and , therefor , can not be responsible for the curvature perturbations imprinted on the thermal bath of the hot big bang .",
    "the only possible solution would be to consider a subsequent period of inflation , occurring after the decay of the vector field , which would last long enough to drastically diminish @xmath50 , but not too long to render the original inflationary period irrelevant .",
    "this highly contrived scenario , however , suffers from another problem , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , in order to avoid large scale anisotropy in the universe , we do not consider the possibility that the vector field in question can act as the inflaton field .",
    "instead we assume that the vector field may imprint its spectrum of curvature perturbations onto the universe at some time after the end of inflation , when it becomes dominant ( or nearly dominant ) before its decay .",

    "we can then assume that the scalar field @xmath142 is heavy during inflation and , therefore , .",
    "however , at or after the end of inflation a phase transition gives non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to both scalar fields . in this scenario",
    "the vacuum mass of the vector field would be @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the vevs of @xmath131 and @xmath142 respectively . from the above",
    "we see that there is a chance that , after inflation , the mass of the vector field ceases to be tachyonic provided .",
    "this also means that , in the vacuum , @xmath131 is not a ghost .    a similar way to attain the desired results but without casting doubt in the validity of eq .",
    "( [ phi2 ] ) is as follows .",
    "one can consider that instead of the mass term changing signs after inflation , the kinetic term of the vector field does so . indeed , in supergravity the kinetic term of a vector field is multiplied by the gauge kinetic function @xmath148 : @xmath149 the gauge kinetic function is a holomorphic function of the fields of the theory .",
    "suppose that it is of the form @xmath150 where @xmath144 is an appropriate cutoff scale .",
    "then , similarly as before , we may assume that @xmath142 is heavy during inflation and , therefore , driven to zero .",
    "this introduces a change of sign of the kinetic term of the vector field .",
    "suppose , now , that the mass of the vector field is , where @xmath151 is the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "then , for our considerations , the reversal of the sign of the kinetic term is entirely equivalent to the reversal of the sign of the mass - term because changing the overall sign of the vector lagrangian density in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) does not affect the equations of motion in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) .",
    "therefore , particle production of the vector field will take place during inflation .",
    "however , the physics will be affected because one has to consider that the sign for the gravitational lagrangian density is not reversed and we may still run into trouble in the same manner as with the ghost condensate above .",
    "now , after inflation , a phase transition may send @xmath142 to a non - zero value @xmath147 .",
    "this changes the sign of the kinetic term ( renderring the vacuum stable ) provided . in this case , in the post - inflation era our vector field undergoes the desired oscillations and can become a successful curvaton .",
    "another way to comply with the requirement in eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) is to assign a `` potential '' @xmath152 to the vector field , in the manner considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where . for example , that way we may assume a negative mass - squared with the vacuum stabilised through a self - coupling of the vector field of the form : @xmath153 i.e. we assume , with . such self - couplings might arise when considering non - abelian vector fields .",
    "note that , the above assumption generates a positive mass - squared in the vacuum for our vector field .",
    "this means that , while the vector field may lie on top of the @xmath154potential hill during inflation , after inflation @xmath155 and the vector field begins oscillating in a potential , corresponding to isotropic pressureless matter as we have shown .- potential not linear to @xmath156 then one expects @xmath157 .",
    "due to eq .",
    "( [ tdiag ] ) this is bound to generate a large - scale anisotropy if the oscillating vector field dominates the universe .",
    "it is intriguing that a weak such anisotropy ( preferred axis ) is claimed to exist in the cmb radiation @xcite . ]    finally , note that the vector field may not need to oscillate and dominate the universe after inflation , in order to imprint its curvature perturbation spectrum .",
    "one may consider a modulated - reheating scenario @xcite , where the vector field controls the decay rate of the inflaton through a coupling such as the one in eq .",
    "( [ lm ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the above scenarios are quite contrived and involve a number of tunings .",
    "in summary we have shown that , in principle , a vector field can indeed be responsible for the observed curvature perturbation in the universe . in order to be so the mass - squared of the vector field has to be during inflation .",
    "the vector field must be subdominant during inflation to avoid generating a large - scale anisotropy .",
    "hence , particle production generates an originally isocurvature perturbation , which can become adiabatic if , after inflation , the vector field dominates the universe before its decay , in accordance to the curvaton scenario .",
    "indeed , we have shown that , if after inflation the mass - squared of the vector field becomes positive , then the field begins oscillating .",
    "we have demonstrated that an oscillating vector field scales as pressureless matter with the universe expansion and does not cause any large scale anisotropy even when it dominates the universe .",
    "hence , provided the mass of the vector field complies to the above requirements , the ` vector curvaton ' scenario can account successfully for the observations .",
    "admittedly , the condition for the mass of the vector field during inflation is hard to achieve and , at best , amounts to a certain level of tunning .",
    "still , using a ` vector curvaton ' may be additionally motivated by the fact that no scalar fields have been observed as yet in nature .",
