    "ab - initio many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) is a state of the art method to reliably describe excited electronic states in electronic - structure theory @xcite .",
    "here we first briefly outline mbpt for electron - hole pairs for comparison and to provide a common notation .",
    "thereafter corresponding issues for two electrons are outlined , followed by the discussion of trionic states for two electrons and one hole .",
    "the discussion is carried out in second quantization and kept very brief and simple , for explanatory purpose . before deriving the hamilton matrices in our many - body approach",
    ", hartree - fock theory is used for explanatory reasons only .",
    "the formal description of correlated particles follows general concepts @xcite that have been employed for , e.g. , semiconductor quantum dots @xcite . here",
    "we present the following derivations and formulas to have a consistent notation to extend it .",
    "our many - body approach adds two essential features to those approaches : ( i ) we incorporate inhomogeneous and anisotropic dielectric screening @xmath15 on the atomic scale , rather than using a dielectric constant @xmath17 or a simple distance dependence @xmath49 .",
    "( ii ) the band - structure energies and the screened coulomb interaction between the particles both result from the same @xmath0 self - energy operator ( which incorporates dielectric screening ) and must be evaluated on equal footing .      within second - quantization notation",
    ", the ground state for an @xmath50-electron system may be denoted as @xmath51 .",

    "we prefer the short - hand notation @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) for the sake of brevity . within hartree - fock theory ,",
    "the single - particle states @xmath61 are considered to be the solutions of the hartree - fock equations ( i.e. @xmath51 is taken as a single slater determinant and minimizes the total energy of the system ) .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian is then given as @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the matrix elements of the single - particle terms ( kinetic energy and external potential , e.g. pseudopotentials from the cores ) and @xmath64 being matrix elements of the coulomb interaction : @xmath65 the coordinate @xmath66 combines position and spin ; correspondingly , the integration includes spin summation , i.e. @xmath67 . at the moment , the bare coulomb interaction is considered , i.e. @xmath68 . the implementation of screening effects ( replacing @xmath69 by @xmath70 ) is discussed further below .",
    "it turns out that the free electron - hole pair configurations @xmath71 are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ supp_eq2 ] ) , because the matrix elements between two configurations @xmath71 and @xmath72 are non - diagonal : @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the ( hartree - fock ) band - structure energy of level @xmath75 .",
    "the hartree - fock ground - state energy @xmath76 can be disregarded in the following .",
    "excited states result as linear combinations of the free electron - hole pair configurations , given by the diagonalization of the hamilton matrix of eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq4 ] ) : @xmath77 and the excitation energy @xmath78 of excitation @xmath79 resulting from the eigenvalue equation @xmath80 these coupled states are the true electron - hole excitations ( i.e. , excitons in periodic systems ) .",
    "note that the discussion here is restricted to the tamm - dancoff approximation within time - dependent hartree - fock theory .",
    "( [ supp_eq5 ] ) and ( [ supp_eq6 ] ) contain the total momentum * q * of the exciton , which ( according to bloch s theorem ) is a good quantum number of the exciton and can be preselected .",
    "accordingly , the summations in eqs .",
    "( [ supp_eq5 ] ) and ( [ supp_eq6 ] ) , which contain double summations over @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are restricted to such @xmath59 that fulfill @xmath81 .",
    "the electron - hole pair configurations yield a real - space amplitude of @xmath82 ( employing annihilation and creation field operators , with @xmath7 and @xmath83 denoting the coordinates of the hole and the electron ) , with a corresponding linear combination for a coupled state @xmath79 : @xmath84 ( again with the restriction @xmath81 in the summation ) .",
    "furthermore , optical dipole transitions between the ground state and an excited state are controlled by the dipole - moment operator , @xmath85 , yielding @xmath86 note that only states with @xmath43 yield a non - zero dipole moment .",
    "a formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq4 ] ) can be derived independently within many - body perturbation theory .",
    "however , two important changes result from the consideration of dielectric screening effects : ( i ) the hartree - fock energy levels are replaced by quasiparticle levels @xmath87 from a @xmath0 calculation , and ( ii ) the interaction matrix elements between the electron - hole pair configurations becomes screened in the direct interaction part .",
    "we thus obtain an effective hamiltonian for electron - hole pair states : @xmath88 which is employed in the well established @xmath0/bse method .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath89 have the same structure as eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq3 ] ) , but with the screened coulomb interaction @xmath90 which includes dielectric screening effects in terms of the ( inverse ) dielectric function of the system via @xmath91 .",
    "as in most @xmath0/bse studies , we use dynamic screening in the @xmath0 , but restrict ourselves to static screening in the bse . note that within mbpt the exchange interaction between electrons and holes results from the classical part of the ( bare ) coulomb interaction and is therefore not screened .      as a preparation for trion states ,",
    "we take an intermediate step and discuss states in which two electrons are moving in the conduction bands .",
    "an independent - particle configuration would be given by @xmath92 to avoid double counting , we require that @xmath93 .",
    "this assumes that the empty states are ordered .",
    "the definition of the order is arbitrary ( in particular when @xmath56 ) includes a wave number ) but has to be kept . within hartree - fock theory , the configurations ( [ supp_eq11 ] ) are again not eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ supp_eq2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the hamilton matrix elements between such configurations result as @xmath94 the diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq12 ] ) yields correlated electron - electron pair states .",
    "the two - electron states ( [ supp_eq11 ] ) have a real - space amplitude of @xmath95 ( with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the coordinates of the two electrons ) which reflects the anti - symmetry required from two identical particles ( including the vanishing of the wave function for @xmath96 , i.e. same position and spin ) .    for physical correspondence to eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq9 ] ) we again replace the hartree - fock levels by qp energy levels ( also stemming from the @xmath0 approach ) and screen the interaction .",
    "we thus obtain an effective hamiltonian for electron - electron pair states : @xmath97 note that both interaction terms are screened .",
    "this is necessary to guarantee invariance of the entire approach when the order of the single - particle states ( see at the beginning of this subsection ) is selected in a different way .      as a direct extension of secs .",
    "[ subsec_bse ] and [ subsec_ee ] , independent - particle configurations of two electrons and one hole are constructed as latexmath:[\\[\\label{supp_eq21 }    with the restriction again that @xmath93 within the chosen order of the single - particle levels , to avoid double counting among the identical electrons .    within the framework of hartree - fock theory , the matrix elements between these configurations are @xmath99 the interpretation of these terms is straight - forward : the first line of eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq22 ] ) describes independent motion of each particle in the system s band structure , while the other terms describe the interaction ( direct and exchange ) between the two electrons , and between the hole and each of the electrons .    in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ supp_eq9 ] ) and ( [ supp_eq14 ] ) we employ an effective hamiltonian for trion states as : @xmath100 again , keeping the general form as in eq .",

    ", @xmath104 denotes the total momentum of the trion state ( which , similar to excitons , is a good quantum number following bloch s theorem ) . since the wave numbers of the contributing configurations @xmath105 have to fulfill the requirement @xmath106 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq23 ] ) is reduced .",
    "similar to excitons and electron - electron states , a configuration ( [ supp_eq21 ] ) has a real - space amplitude @xmath107 ( with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the coordinates of the hole and the two electrons ) and the corresponding linear combination for the trion state , is given by @xmath108    the expansion coefficients @xmath109 and the energy @xmath110 of a trion @xmath111 result from the eigenvalue problem @xmath112 note that the energy @xmath110 is _ not _ a transition energy to occur in an ( optical ) spectrum . such transitions ( including absorption or emission of a photon ) would occur between the trion @xmath101 and an electron in the conduction band @xmath113 ( i.e. the single electron from which the absorption process starts , or the single electron which remains after one electron and the hole of the trion have recombined ) .",
    "note that the trion and the remaining electron must have the same wave number @xmath104 to allow photon - assisted transitions between them .",
    "consequently , ( optical ) transition energies would be given by @xmath114 this is associated with a dipole moment @xmath115",
    "due to the third particle , the configuration space is much larger for trions than for excitons .",
    "a precise analysis of the required hardware is therefore necessary .    the number of occupied bands included in eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq23 ] ) is denoted as @xmath116 , the unoccupied bands as @xmath117 and the number of @xmath118-points as @xmath119 .",
    "the size of the trion hamiltonian is @xmath120 ( instead of @xmath121 for excitons ) , including the factor @xmath241/2 from the restriction that @xmath5@xmath122@xmath6 ( see sec . [ subsec_eeh ] ) .",
    "therefore the full hamilton matrix can only be stored in memory for very small systems .    in eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq28 ] ) all four terms ( kinetic energy , electron - electron interaction and electron - hole interaction ) include kronecker deltas .",
    "this allows to index these combinations properly and therefore to reduce the number of floating point operations for every matrix - vector multiplication drastically , in analogy to commonly known sparse matrix operations . in addition , this makes it possible to restrict the memory requirement tremendously and to share it efficiently between the processors . the minimal required memory for non - zero elements of the hamiltonian scales with @xmath123 .",
    "in the particular case of the ( 8,0 ) cnt , we usually employ @xmath27 @xmath118-points , 16 valence bands ( out of a total of 128 valence bands , including spin ) and 16 conduction bands . in these calculations ,",
    "less than one percent of the hamilton matrix elements is non - zero .",
    "this causes memory requirements of about @xmath124 gb . when @xmath125 @xmath118-points are employed , the requirement rises to about @xmath126 gb .",
    "in addition , up to ten vectors ( of the dimension of the hamiltonian ) are required for the iterative procedure of applying the hamiltonian to states and for the evaluation of the spectrum ( using , e.g. , the haydock method ) . for the determination of trion states by an iterative diagonalization , on the other hand , more vectors and therefore more memory is required . for example , the determination of the lowest 5000 trion states ( i.e. , all states below 2.2ev in fig .  1 of the main text ) requires about @xmath127 gb of memory , again employing @xmath27 @xmath118-points .",
    "the trion calculations are carried out in the framework of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "therefore several steps are necessary , which will be discussed one after the other .      as a basis for the many - body calculations of the ( 8,0 )",
    "cnt we first carry out a dft calculation to provide an optimized geometry , dft wave functions , and their band - structure energies .",
    "the @xmath128 cnt consists of @xmath27 carbon atoms in the unit cell , the configuration is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figstruc ] .",
    "the structure has eight - fold rotational symmetry along the tube axis , two mirror symmetries are observed perpendicular to it at the center and the border of the marked unit cell . the local density approximation ( in the parametrization of perdew and zunger @xcite ) .",
    "norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite in kleinman - bylander form @xcite are used .",
    "we employ a mixed basis of 5 shells of gaussian orbitals ( 38 functions with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 symmetry , with decay constants from 0.1 to 3.0 @xmath133 ) per carbon atom plus plane waves with a cutoff of @xmath134ry .",
    "the basis is unstable due to ( almost ) linear dependence among the basis functions .",
    "stability is recovered by eliminating those linear combinations which are responsible for the instability , such that the resulting overlap matrix is again positive definite .",
    "a mesh of 16 @xmath118-points in the one dimensional brillouin zone is employed for the dft .",
    "we obtain an optimized lattice constant of @xmath135  and a tube diameter of @xmath136   after full relaxation of the structure .",
    "we employ a large unit cell perpendicular to the tube axis to guarantee a minimal distance of @xmath137  between the tubes . with this",
    "we obtain the eigenvalues and wave functions which serve as input for the @xmath0 calculation .",
    "the mbpt calculations are carried out within the @xmath0 approximation for the electron self energy .",
    "this requires a second , auxiliary basis set in which two - point quantities ( e.g. , the dielectric function , the screened coulomb interaction etc . ) are represented .",
    "again , a mixed basis of 4 shells of gaussian orbitals ( 34 functions with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath138 symmetry , with decay constants from 0.25 to 4.0 @xmath133 ) per carbon atom plus plane waves with a cutoff of @xmath134ry is used , which again has to be stabilized by elimination of linear dependence .",
    "the main purpose of the @xmath0 calculation is to provide the band - structure energies @xmath139 required in eqs .",
    "( [ supp_eq9 ] ) and ( [ supp_eq28 ] ) , for the * k*-points in which the exciton and trion states are represented .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy operator further involves an integration in reciprocal space , which is carried out by a finite sum over * q*-points . for reasons of consistency with the bse and trion calculation ( see below )",
    "we employ a grid of * q*-points given by the differences between the * k*-points of the exciton ( or trion ) states .",
    "obviously this difference grid includes the @xmath44 point ( @xmath140 ) , at which the coulomb interaction diverges .",
    "we solve this problem by replacing the screened coulomb interaction @xmath141 by its average @xmath142 in the reciprocal volume @xmath143 of each grid point @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath0 calculations should include self - consistency in terms of the resulting band - structure energies .",
    "here we simplify this requirement by including a scissors shift of @xmath145ry before the rpa screening and the @xmath0 self - energy operator are evaluated .",
    "thereby we anticipate the opening of the gap in a self - consistent approach .",
    "comparing to this , our procedure is accurate to within 0.05 ev . starting from a dft - lda gap of 0.58 ev , we finally obtain a @xmath0 band gap of 1.70 ev .",
    "similar results of @xmath146 ev ( dft ) and @xmath147ev ( @xmath0 ) have been found previously @xcite .",
    "the optical properties are then obtained by solving the bse .",
    "we have tested convergence with respect to the * k*-points , using grids from 16 to 64 points .",
    "the resulting optical spectra are compiled in fig .",
    "[ figs1 ] .",
    "we observe results converged better than @xmath145ev even for meshes with only 16 @xmath118-points .",
    "especially the first optical peak at @xmath148ev is very stable , as well as the first dark exciton at @xmath149ev ( not shown ) .",
    "both this optical peak and the next one at @xmath150ev are in good agreement with previous studies , as well as with experimental data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in the last step we include an additional electron , and consider trion states as linear combinations of three - particle configurations . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : req ] , the direct diagonalization of the trion hamilton operator is not possible due to its high dimension ( @xmath2410@xmath151 ) , which depends on the number of bands and , in particular , on the number of * k*-points to be considered . for the evaluation of the optical spectrum the haydock recursion method",
    "@xcite and real - time integration followed by fourier transform @xcite are a well established techniques . for the determination of a limited number of eigenstates at low energy , we employ iterative diagonalization techniques @xcite .",
    "we have carefully checked the convergence behaviour of the spectra ( using the haydock method and using fourier transform after real - time integration ) and of the eigenstates with respect to the * k*-point sampling ( see fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] ) .",
    "we have further checked that in the low - energy part of the spectrum ( accessible by iterative diagonalization ) the eigenstates and the haydock method yield the same spectral data .    to converge the full trion spectrum",
    "a larger number of @xmath118-points has to be used than for the excitons .",
    "fortunately , the low - energy results from 32 @xmath118-point are already reasonably well converged ( in comparison with data from larger sets , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] ) .      in analogy to the dipole moment for an exciton ( see eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq7b ] ) ) the optical dipole moment for a trion are calculated by eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq27 ] ) .",
    "note that in contrast to excitons , the initial ( or final ) state from ( or to ) which a transition occurs is _ not _ the ground state @xmath51 but a single - electron state in a conduction band , @xmath113 .",
    "due to momentum conservation in the optical transition , this electron s momentum must equal the trion momentum , * k*. for fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] we have chosen @xmath32 , and the single - electron initial / final state is the cbm .",
    "although the spectra from various * k*-point grids are in reasonable agreement with each other , their exact shape slightly depends on the @xmath118-point mesh , in particular at higher energy .",
    "fortunately , the behaviour of the low - energy states is very stable .",
    "[ figs3 ] shows the convergence of two excitons and of the related trions with respect to the grid density .",
    "in particular the energies of the lowest - energy trion ( at 1.1 ev ) and of the lowest dipole - allowed trion ( at 1.4 ev ) are very stable , similar to the excitons .    -points .",
    "the first dark ( bright ) exciton and trion are marked by black ( red ) crosses and dots .",
    "in addition , further trions ( that are found in the manageable number of lowest states ) are indicated by blue dots . ]",
    "optical absorption due to trions starts from a single - electron state and ends in a trion state .",
    "in contrast , luminescence ( see fig .",
    "1 b of the main text ) starts from the trions and ends in a single - electron state @xmath113 , again conserving total momentum . in this context",
    "several issues have to be considered .",
    "first , after the original excitation process the trions will ( after some time ) equilibrate according to the system s temperature . by including a temperature - dependent boltzmann distribution",
    ", we obtain a luminescence spectrum @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "secondly , this expression requires to consider all possible momenta * k * and final - state band indices @xmath58 .",
    "however , we find in our calculations that the dipole moments are particularly strong near @xmath32 and quickly decrease for @xmath154 . furthermore ,",
    "@xmath110 increases for @xmath155 , leading to a decreasing boltzmann factor and decreasing contribution to eq .",
    "( [ supp_eq29 ] ) .",
    "we have found that focusing on @xmath32 is sufficient , since the inclusion of other momenta has no recognizable effect on the luminescence spectrum at room temperature .",
    "it should also be noted that the optically allowed trions near 1.4ev show strong dipoles only for @xmath156 ( i.e. , the remaining electron in the lowest conduction band ) and much smaller contribution from other bands .",
    "transitions to higher bands @xmath58 occur at lower energy , but are dipole forbidden in the present case .",

    "<S> , we perform a general determination of @xmath14 for one- , two- , and three - dimensional systems ( and gain full access to the atomic composition ) . </S>",
    "<S> this must be performed on a microscopic level , including many - body effects , starting from atom- and orbital - resolved single - particle wave functions @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the six - dimensional dielectric function @xmath15 evaluated from @xmath2 and their energies @xmath16 within the random - phase approximation is also included [ rather than using a dielectric constant @xmath17 or a simple distance dependence @xmath18 . the dielectric function is needed for the screened coulomb interaction ( @xmath19 ) which contains the full information about spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> such procedure was the key to understand excitons in cnts @xcite within an ab - initio @xmath0/bse approach . </S>",
    "<S> we note that ( in contrast to many model hamiltonians ) the screened interaction ( @xmath20 etc . ) within @xmath0/bse ( see e.g. @xcite ) acts in a natural way on the band structure ( @xmath21 etc . ) , on the excitonic binding , and on the trions on equal footing . </S>",

    "<S> fortunately , all coulomb interaction terms ( bare or screened , direct or exchange ) in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) _ are of two - particle nature only _ , and the resulting hamilton matrix is very sparse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this opens an avenue to deal with the trion hamiltonian iteratively , either by haydock recursion or similar @xcite when focusing on spectra , or by the lanczos algorithm or similar @xcite when eigenstates are requested . </S>",
