    "based on the analysis of nmr experiments  @xcite , it offers an explanation for transport and optical experiments  @xcite and a variety of anomalies in underdoped cuprates  @xcite and furthermore yields a d@xmath6-wave pairing state with a transition temperature @xmath7 of correct order of magnitude .  @xcite    however , there are also observations , which indicate effects due to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "raman scattering experiments and ir measurements show the softening of some phonon modes as the temperature is decreased below @xmath7  @xcite . in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8",
    "the largest shift was found for the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) raman - active mode of @xmath11-symmetry , which involves the out - of - plane vibration of the oxygen atoms o(ii ) and o(iii ) in the copper - oxygen planes  @xcite . for some oxygen - related phonon modes",
    "the onset of the frequency softening was found to start even 50 - 60 k above @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of this anomaly was found to be similar to that of the nmr relaxation rate @xmath12 , which , in the latter case , is due to an anomalous behavior of the spin excitations , and indicates a possible coupling between phonons and spin degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "especially interesting is the observation of the anomalous oxygen isotope effect in the high-@xmath7 superconductors  @xcite . at optimal doping with largest @xmath7 only a very small oxygen isotope exponent @xmath13",
    "is observed , whereas in the underdoped and overdoped systems the isotope exponent can reach values close to the bcs - value @xmath14 .",
    "due to these experimental findings it is of interest to investigate in more detail the influence of electron - phonon interaction on the spin fluctuation induced superconducting state . in this context",
    "it was shown that oxygen buckling modes support a @xmath4-pairing state , whereas oxygen breathing modes will support an s - wave state  @xcite .",
    "hence , an analysis of the role of the electron - phonon interaction in the cuprates has to take into account all vibrational modes .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the interplay of the spin fluctuation and the electron - phonon interaction in the superconducting state of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we find that taking into account both spin fluctuation and electron - phonon interaction gives a superconducting state of d@xmath6-symmetry , while electron - phonon interaction alone would yield an anisotropic s - wave pairing with a much smaller critical temperature .",
    "the @xmath4-superconducting state is caused by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and the critical temperature @xmath7 is reduced by simoultaneous consideration of phonons .",
    "nevertheless we find a positive isotope effect .",
    "we show that the momentum dependence of the total electron - phonon interaction amplifies the pairing interaction by an amount of about 5 - 10% in the @xmath4-wave channel , which is a necessary condition for a positive isotope effect .",
    "furthermore we identify the phonon - modes , which make the most dominant contribution to the @xmath4-pairing interaction .",
    "the decrease of @xmath7 is explained by the large isotropic part of the electron - phonon interaction , which enhances the electron scattering rate significantly .",
    "however , this effect will be reduced when correlation effects are taken into account , since correlation induced suppression of charge fluctuations will predominantly reduce the isotropic part of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "our results are obtained with a self - consistent strong coupling eliashberg calculation .",
    "finally , in order to make this interplay of spin fluctuation and electron - phonon interaction more transparent , we present a simple weak coupling model .    in the present work we will not address a variety of rather important aspects of the electron - phonon interaction in cuprates . in calculating the electron - phonon coupling constants",
    ", we will completely ignore the correlated nature of the involved charge carriers , even though this is expected to be essential to deduce reliable quantitative information about the strength of this interaction and its relative importance for different phonon modes .",
    "based on calculations by zeyher and kuli  @xcite , we can at least show that the latter aspect does not oppose to the conclusions of our results .",
    "furthermore , lattice anharmonicities will also be neglected , since we believe that within the presented framework , where the mutual influence of electron- phonon and spin fluctuation interaction is investigated within an eliashberg theory , anharmonicities , if relevant for the cuprates at all , can hardly affect our result .",
    "these rather drastic approximations are necessary to enable us to draw quantitative , material specific conclusions about the role of phonons within a spin fluctuation scenario .",
    "the main complication in this context is that , in distinction to the electronic system , the phononic degrees of freedom behave completely three dimensional , and there is no obvious restriction to a few relevant phonon modes .",
    "the coupled electron - phonon system is characterized by the hamiltonian : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the electron creation operator of the hybridized cu-3d@xmath6 and o-2p@xmath17 orbitals with energy @xmath18 describing the fermionic low energy degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the spin fluctuations are treated in terms of the interaction of the electron spin with a spin - field @xmath19 characterized by a spin susceptibility @xmath20 .",
    "note , alternatively one could also use a hubbard like hamiltonian and determine @xmath20 diagrammatically , e.g. within the fluctuation exchange approximation  @xcite , which would not change the conclusions of this paper .",

    "we do not restrict the momentum summation to the fermi surface but take the entire bz into account . since",
    "both pairing interactions @xmath71 and @xmath72 are chosen to reproduce the experimental spin - susceptibility and phonon - dispersion , we do not take additional renormalizations of @xmath73 and @xmath74 into account .",
    "first , we will demonstrate that our treatment of the spin fluctuations yields indeed a superconducting state with @xmath4 symmetry and a reasonable critical temperature .",
    "the effective interaction due to spin fluctuations is repulsive for all momenta and is peaked at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath75 , as can be seen in fig .",

    "we investigate the influence of the electron - phonon interaction on the spin - fluctuation induced superconducting state .",
    "solving the eliashberg equations yields @xmath4-superconductivity even in the presence of phonons , as can be seen from the momentum dependence of the gap - function in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] . for obtaining some information about the isotope effect",
    ", we have performed eliashberg calculations for two different oxygen-    isotopes o(16 ) and o(18 ) . for this",
    "the whole electron - phonon interaction , i.e. the phonon dispersions and the electron - phonon coupling constants , has been calculated separately for the two oxygen masses . in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] the momentum averaged density of states at a temperature of @xmath78 is shown for the two oxygen isotopes o(16 ) and o(18 ) .",
    "for comparison the density of states for only spin fluctuation induced superconductivity is shown as well .",
    "two important things can be learned from fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] : the superconducting gap is reduced dramatically in the presence of phonons , but nevertheless the isotope effect is positive .",
    "this can be infered from the fact that there still remains a small superconducting gap in the density of states of the oxygen isotope o(16 ) at the temperature chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ( t=80k ) , whereas for o(18 ) the superconducting gap has already completely disappeared .",
    "note that similar results have been obtained by h .- b .",

    "pao  @xcite .",
    "they also find that the electron - phonon interaction reduces the critical temperature of spin fluctuation - induced superconductivity considerably , whereas the isotope exponent remains small but negative .",
    "however in their calculation this is due to the local nature of the electron - phonon interaction whereas the focus of our work is to investigate the role of the k - dependence of this interaction .    in order to obtain an estimate for the critical temperature of the two oxygen isotopes",
    ", we have performed succesive calculations in the temperature range between 78k and 83k .",
    "since the self - consistent solution of the eliashberg equations gives rise to a finite single particle scattering rate in the gap once the temperature is nonzero we choose the disappearance of the dip structure in the dos as criterion for @xmath7 . in this way we obtain for the oxygen isotope o(16 ) a critical temperature of @xmath79 and for the isotope o(18 ) @xmath80 . using these values for the calculaion of the isotope exponent @xmath81",
    ", we obtain an approximate value of @xmath82 , which is only slightly larger than experimentally found in optimally doped cuprates .    for a better understanding of the phononic contribution to the pairing interaction and the reason for the positive isotope effect",

    "the phonon density - of - states and the mcmillan function @xmath57 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] . for total electron - phonon coupling strength",
    "we obtain @xmath83 , which is in good agreement with estimates of @xmath84 @xcite from experimental determination of frequency shifts and line widths .",
    "nevertheless , the calculated @xmath83 should    lead to a considerable contribution to the resistivity , which within the spin fluctuation model is believed to be dominated by purely electronic scattering .",
    "this indicates that role and relative weight of these two scattering channels for transport phenomena is not yet completely understood .",
    "we checked that modifications of @xmath22 due to backscattering vertex - corrections do not reduce @xmath22 considerably .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) , we show the momentum dependence of the zero frequency effective phonon mediated electron - electron interaction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_ph ] ) .",
    "the interaction is attractive for all momenta and most important for the present study peaked for small momentum transfer . in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](b )    we show the on site interaction @xmath85 : @xmath86 which represents the pairing interaction in the case of isotropic s - wave superconductivity , and the nearest neighbor interaction @xmath87 : @xmath88 which represents the pairing interaction in the case of @xmath4-symmetry superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath85 and @xmath87 are attractive in some frequency range , but the on site interaction is much stronger and the corresponding attractive frequency range is slightly larger .",
    "therefore , phonons alone will give rise to s - wave superconductivity .",
    "this is natural for a phononic mechanism , since the electron - phonon interaction is attractive for all momenta and thus the momentum averaged interaction @xmath85 is dominant .",
    "the self - consistent solution of the eliashberg equations confirms this . taking only the electron - phonon interaction into account",
    ", we obtain superconductivity with anisotropic s - wave symmetry without nodes    as can be seen from the momentum dependence of the off - diagonal self energy in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] . for obtaining this result at the numerically accessible temperatures @xmath89 we had to double the total electron - phonon coupling strength artificially .",
    "but we expect that enhancing the coupling strength should solely increase the critical temperature and not change the symmetry of the superconducting state . even for this artificially large coupling strength of @xmath90 superconductivity",
    "already vanishes between about @xmath91 .",
    "hence , for realistic coupling strengths the critical temperature of phonon induced superconductivity is much smaller than the critical temperature of spin fluctuation induced superconductivity .",
    "note that in this case the repulsive coulomb interaction was not taken into account , which will suppress the critical temperature of the s - wave superconducting state even more .",
    "most interesting , however , is the result that all phonon modes together can generate an attractive interaction between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "thus the consideration of electron - phonon coupling increases the pairing interaction in the @xmath4-wave channel , which is a necessary prerequisit for a positive isotope effect .",
    "the reason for the resulting decrease of the superconducting gap due to the presence of phonons is the large on - site interaction @xmath85 , which enhances the scattering rate dramatically .",
    "therefore , concerning the sign of the isotope effect , it is plausible , that the isotope effect is positive as long as the positive contribution from the increased pairing interaction @xmath87 ( where the larger cut - off corresponds to the smaller oxygen mass ) outweighs the negative contribution from the increased scattering rate due to larger on - site interaction @xmath85 . also it is clear that including both spin fluctuation and electron - phonon interaction still yields @xmath4-superconductivity , since the consideration of electron - phonon coupling even increases the @xmath4-pairing interaction , whereas the spin fluctuation contribution to @xmath85 , the s - wave pairing interaction , is strongly repulsive , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , and therefore reduces the s - wave pairing interaction dramatically .",
    "we will focus now on the question , why the nearest neighbor electron - phonon interaction is attractive at all .",
    "the attractiveness of @xmath87 can be traced back to the fact that the phononic interaction is peaked for small momentum transfer , since multiplication with @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v10 ] ) gives more weight to small momenta .",
    "obviously , besides the shape of the fermi surface , which is taken from arpes experiments , the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon interaction is the key feature , which controls possible contributions to different pairing symmetries .",
    "the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon interaction consists of two contributions , as can be seen by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_ph ] ) ; namely the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon coupling constants and the momentum dependence of the phonon - green s function . because the momentum dependence of the phonon - green s function is directly related to the dispersion of the phonon spectrum , which is relatively weak in the case of dominating optical phonon modes , we find that the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon coupling constants is the decisive factor",
    ". therefore , phonon modes with coupling strength largest for small momentum transfer can enhance the @xmath4 pairing interaction .",
    "however , phonon modes with coupling strongest for large momentum transfer reduce the @xmath4 pairing interaction .    in order to find out which phonon modes support the @xmath4-pairing interaction , the vibrations of single atoms ( per unit cell ) will be investigated . for illustration of the structure of",
    "yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 we refer to fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] .",
    "the greatest coupling strength is caused by the vibration of the in - plane oxygens o(ii ) , with vibration amplitudes along the cu - o bonding axis and along the z - axis , i.e. breathing mode like and buckling mode like vibrations , and by the vibrations of the apex oxygen o(i ) in z - direction .",
    "for illustration of the displacement patterns of the breathing mode and the buckling mode we refer to fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] the momentum dependence along the @xmath93-direction of the corresponding electron - phonon coupling is shown .",
    "the in - plane oxygen o(ii , iii ) vibrations are quite well described by the momentum dependence @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which is the result for the breathing and buckling mode , respectively , if only nearest neighbor interaction is considered .",
    "thus the breathing mode reduces @xmath4-superconductivity , because the momentum dependence of its coupling strength is peaked for large momentum transfer . on the other hand the coupling strength of the buckling mode",
    "is peaked for small momentum transfer and therefore the buckling mode supports @xmath4-wave superconductivity in so far as the @xmath4-pairing interaction is increased by the buckling mode .",
    "the small wiggles in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] are caused by wiggles in the momentum dependence of the free susceptibility @xmath96 , which determines the screening properties of the cuo@xmath0-planes ( see appendix ) . in the case of the apex oxygen vibrations ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the coupling is different for the two apex ions in the primitive cell : the closer apex oxygen causes a more or less momentum independent coupling , whereas the coupling of the further apex oxygen is stronger for small momentum transfer similar to the buckling mode like vibrations . in respect to vibrations of the other ions , which are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] , we find that the coupling of vibrations in z - direction is generally peaked for small momentum transfer .",
    "the vibration of the oxygen ions is the most dominant contribution to the total coupling strength , whereas the contribution of yttrium and barium is very small due to screening in the cuo@xmath0-planes .",
    "altogether all vibrations in z - direction , especially the buckling modes , increase the nearest neighbor interaction @xmath87 . only the breathing mode and the vibration of the chain oxygen o(iv ) along the @xmath97-bonding axis reduce @xmath87 .",
    "the other modes are of no relevance with respect to @xmath87 .",
    "note that within our approach the coupling strength of the buckling mode is about twice as large as the coupling strength of the breathing mode .",
    "the situation is opposite , if the same calculations are performed with the original zeyher - model .",
    "the reason for this is to be found in the different treatment of screening . in zeyher s model",
    "the screening planes are smeared over the whole elementary cell , whereas in our approach the exact position of the @xmath37-planes with respect to the vibrating ion and the cooper - pairing hole is considered .",
    "it is evident that    the screening of the breathing mode is better , if one accounts for the fact that both the vibrating oxygen ion and the cooper pair forming hole are located within the same plane . on the other hand",
    "the opposite is true for the buckling mode . because the vibration of the oxygen- ion in z - direction is perpendicular to the @xmath37-plane , it can not be screened within the same plane , but only by charges induced in more distant planes .",
    "therefore , the buckling mode is less screened , if one takes the relative location of the vibrating oxygen - ion , the cooper - pairing hole , and the screening plane explicitly into account . additionally , it has to be pointed out that in our approach ( as in the zeyher - model ) only the electrostatic part of the electron - phonon coupling is considered , whereas all contributions arising from changes in the overlap of neighboring electronic wave functions have been neglected .",
    "it is to be expected that these neglected effects are strongest for the breathing mode .",
    "this means that the coupling strength of the breathing mode could be somewhat underestimated in our approach . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that recently the electron - phonon coupling was calculated by o.  k.  andersen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and o.  jepsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite within a tight - binding model derived from lda linear - response calculations .",
    "they find a total electron - phonon coupling strength of @xmath98 , which is similar to our findings , and a medium @xmath4-wave - coupling strenth of @xmath99 , which is even much larger than our value .",
    "most interesting , they also find a very dominant coupling of the buckling mode .",
    "although their approach is complementary to ours , their results are quite similar , which supports our results concerning the relative coupling strengths of the breathing and the buckling mode .",
    "anyway we expect that a more dominant breathing mode would reduce @xmath87 somewhat , leaving the other results qualitatively unchanged .",
    "our numerical results , obtained within a strong coupling eliashberg theory , show that the electron - phonon interaction reduces the critical temperature , even though it increases the d - wave pairing interaction and the isotope effect is positive . in order to investigate these aspects in a qualitative , but more transparent way",

    "there are two contributions , which determine the size of the gap - function @xmath119 .",

    ", this is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation . whether the increase of @xmath46 for non - optimal doping concentration is solely due to the decreasing strength of the leading electronic pairing interaction or of more subtile nature is beyond the scope of the present paper",
    "in summary , we find that spin fluctuation induced @xmath4-superconductivity is robust against the existence of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature is reduced by the interaction with phonons due to an enhancement of the electron scattering rate .",
    "furthermore , we find that the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon interaction increases the @xmath4-pairing interaction slightly .",
    "this is important for getting a positive isotope effect .",
    "our results indicate that the isotope effect is small for optimal doping .",
    "if one assumes that the spin - fluctuation coupling strength varies with the doping concentration , this would imply a strong doping dependence of the isotope effect .",
    "a major approximation of the present work is the neglect of the effect of strong electronic correlation on the electron - phonon coupling constants .",
    "as shown by lichtenstein and kuli  @xcite strong electronic correlation cause a suppression of charge fluctuations at small distances .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath126 to be reduced for zone boundary phonons",
    ". this would decrease @xmath127 and thus the large scattering rate due to phonons .",
    "for the same reason , we expect @xmath101 to be slightly enhanced by electronic correlations .",
    "our results demonstrate that the existance and sign of the isotope effect can be understood within a spin fluctuation induced d - wave state . due to the d - wave nature of the superconducting state",
    ", it is particularly important to obtain a proper description of the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "it was shown that out - of - plane vibrations are essential for the d - wave state and that one can not focus solely on one particular phononic mode .",
    "finally , the strong electronic correlations inhibit the occurrence of a phonon induced superconducting state with s - wave symmetry .",
    "a phonon induced d - wave state can be excluded because of the insufficient strength of this subdominant pairing interaction .",
    "we are grateful to m. peter , d. pines , m. kuli , b. stojkovi , and c. thomsen for helpful conversations on this and related topics .",
    "j. s. acknowledges the financial support of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "in this appendix the treatment of the local field corrections arising from the position of the screening @xmath37-planes relatively to the vibrating ion will be discussed .",
    "if spatial inhomogenity is taken into account , the dielectric function becomes a matrix in the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath128 : @xmath129 here , @xmath130 is the irreducible polarization of the density - density correlation function @xmath131 , which characterizes the screening properties of the system .",
    "the inverse dielectric function is defined by : @xmath132 this can be expressed as : @xmath133 the susceptibility @xmath131 has to be determined by solving the following integral equation : @xmath134 in the cuprates the most dominant screening is caused by mobile charges within the cuo@xmath0-planes . in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 there are two planes per unit cell .",
    "therefore , the susceptibility @xmath131 is a @xmath135-matrix , describing density - density correlations within the same plane and between both of the planes .",
    "the polarization @xmath130 on the other hand reduces to a diagonal matrix , because the particles are assumed to be confined to the planes . in real space",
    "the polarization is given by : @xmath136 where @xmath137 are the z - coordinates of the @xmath37-planes , with @xmath138 being the index for the primitive cell , @xmath139 the index for the @xmath37-plane within the primitive cell and c the height of the primitive cell .",
    "fourier transformation yields : @xmath140 here , @xmath141 refer to the in - plane wave vectors , whereas @xmath142 represent the wave vectors in z - direction . in rpa @xmath143",
    "reduces to the noninteracting particle - hole bubble of the holes in the @xmath37-planes .",
    "@xmath130 is diagonal with respect to the in - plane wave vectors and the @xmath144-dependence is simple enough .",
    "this permits an analytic treatment of the @xmath144-summations .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : dyson - chi ] ) can be inverted easily and the inverse dielectric function can be obtained in this way .",
    "there remains only the question of how to choose the z - coordinate @xmath145 of the screening planes , which are not unambiguous due to the internal buckling of the @xmath37-planes .",
    "in our calculations we assumed that the screening plane should follow the buckling of the @xmath37-plane .    99 present address : institut fr theorie der kondensierten materie , universitt karlsruhe , d-76128 karlsruhe , germany p. monthoux , a. balatsky , and d. pines , phys .",
