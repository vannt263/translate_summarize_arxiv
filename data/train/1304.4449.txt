    "in particular , for the lattice parameters optimized with gga ( @xmath15=4.06   and @xmath16=5.51   @xcite ) , the band gap is only slightly underestimated , as 1.8 ev to be compared with the experimental value of 1.9 ev @xcite ( for this compound , good agreement of the size of the band gap estimated theoretically with that found experimentally has been pointed out in earlier work as well @xcite ) .",
    "application of the experimental value of the lattice parameters causes the band gap to shrink by 0.22 ev @xcite . because the size of the band gap is crucial in order to correctly define the appearance of the defect states inside the band gap ,",
    "the band structure properties have been evaluated for the optimized lattice parameters . however , for calculations of the defect formation energy , an adjustment of the interlayer distance by using the experimental data of the lattice constant ( @xmath17 @xcite ) has been performed .",
    "it was found that only the formation energy of the pb interstitial is considerably affected by the mismatch in the lattice parameters , caused by the poor incorporation of pb atom of large atomic radius between the layers ( the formation energies of the vacancy defects have been pointed out not to be affected by gga limitation in our previous work @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the literature on defect formation in semiconductors @xcite and particularly in simple oxides @xcite , has revealed that additionally to the vacancy defects investigated in our previous study @xcite , interstitials have to be considered . for crystalline materials ,",
    "interstitial defects induce a large lattice distortion into their immediate neighbourhood that results in their high formation energy @xcite . in this regard ,",

    "we start from a short description of the vacancy defects already investigated in our previous work @xcite . the o vacancy ( @xmath18 ) is occupied by two electrons localized on the four nearest pb atoms with maximum of the electron density to manifest at the vacancy site ( see the electron density distribution in fig .  [",

    "the pb vacancy has also three charge states ( 0 , 1@xmath22 , 2@xmath22 ) but its charge states would be of negative sign , i.e. ionization of the vacancy occurs through an electron gain .",
    "the effect of mismatch of the lattice parameters on location of the vacancy - induced states was examined .",
    "it is found that a position of the defect states relatively to the valence band top is not affected with application of the experimental lattice parameters : since the vacancy states are localized entirely within single layer , an alteration in the interlayer interactions has almost no impact on its property @xcite .",

    "electrons occupying the vacancy site are indicated by the arrows while filled circles correspond to absence of electron . ]",
    "there are two interstitial defects to be considered in @xmath0-pbo crystal lattice , the o and pb interstitials .",
    "binding of the o interstitial ( @xmath25 ) to the host occurs with participation of the lone pair pb:@xmath13 electrons from the host ( the lone pair pb:@xmath13 in @xmath0-pbo is chemically active @xcite ) : the bond is made between lone pair pb:@xmath13 electrons of the host and o:@xmath28 empty orbital of oxygen atom .",
    "the o:@xmath28 empty orbital appears upon excitation of the ground state o:@xmath29 to the o@xmath30:@xmath31 state .",

    "inside the band gap , the localized state is located above the midgap at @xmath19(@xmath25)-@xmath20=1.27 ev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) . this localized state can accommodate up to two extra electrons and , therefore , there are three charge states ( 0 , 1@xmath22 , 2@xmath22 ) are assigned to it .    the energetically favourable position of the pb interstitial ( @xmath26 ) in the lattice is similar to the o interstitial , i.e. on top of the pb atom .",
    "the pb interstitial is exited from the ground state of configuration pb:@xmath13@xmath14 to the pb@xmath30:@xmath32@xmath33 state thus allowing @xmath32 and @xmath34 electrons to contribute in bond formation with the host .",
    "the host pb atom participates in bonding , again with its pb:@xmath13 electrons ( the bond length is 2.9  ) .",
    "the originated defect state is occupied by two electrons which are pb:@xmath35 electrons belonging to @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( d ) ) . since each electron stays on its own orbital , hund s rules dictate the ferromagnetic ordering of these electrons @xcite . the spin - polarization energy defined as the energy difference between the spin - unpolarized and spin - polarized states",
    "is found to be @xmath36=0.235 ev that indicates the stable triplet ground state @xcite .",
    "the pb interstitial induces a localized state inside the band gap and spin - polarized solution separates the occupied and unoccupied states as @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=0.99 ev and @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=1.51 ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "ionization of the defect state formed by the pb interstitial can occur as through electron gaining ( ( 1@xmath22 ) for one electron added and ( 2@xmath22 ) for two electrons ) , so , through an excitation of existing electrons .",
    "overall , there are five charged states ( 2 + , 1 + , 0 , 1@xmath22 , 2@xmath22 ) can be considered for the pb interstitial .    since properties of the interstitial defects are expected to depend on the interlayer distance , an alteration in position of the defect states inside the band gap with implementation of the experimental lattice parameters has been investigated .",
    "it was found that for the o interstitial the defect state is shifted only by 0.05 ev outwards @xmath37 .",
    "however , the effect is more pronounced for the pb interstitial because of larger atomic radius of pb atom .",
    "thus , the state occupied by electrons appears at @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=0.97 ev while empty state at @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=1.25 ev .",
    "moreover , for the defect state like pb interstitial , dft is known to delocalize the defect wave function and underestimate the splitting between the unoccupied and occupied states that occurs due to self - interaction of the unpaired electrons @xcite .",
    "therefore , defect wave - function localization has been additionally examined with hartree - fock ( hf ) approach applied directly to the unpaired electrons @xcite ( in this way the accuracy provided by dft is preserved ) . indeed",
    ", it resulted in stronger localization and , therefore , enhanced splitting of the defect states such as @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=0.54 ev for the occupied state and @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=1.66 ev for the empty state .",
    "however , since the experimental lattice parameters and hf correction have opposite effect on the defect wave function localization , application of both leads to compensation effect in level splitting such as appearance of the defect states in the band gap is @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=0.54 ev for the occupied state and @xmath19(@xmath26)-@xmath20=1.22 ev for the empty state .",
    "since the band gap size is reduced by 0.22 ev @xcite , location of these defect states in respect to bottom of the conduction band is very close to that found with gga ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "we have established that some defects can act as a donor impurity ( @xmath38 ) , others as acceptors ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , while @xmath26 can be both an electron donor ( @xmath41 ) and an acceptor ( @xmath42 ) . an ability of defects to appear in several charge states encourages the electron exchange between defects : the electron donor compensates missing electrons on the acceptor .",
    "the process of the charge exchange defines the energetically favorable charge state for defects appearing upon compound growth .",
    "the main way to identify formation of defects inherent to the crystal structure is to compare the formation energies of different defects , as particularly this parameter is a measure of the defect concentration .",
    "the formation energy of a defect @xmath43 in charge state @xmath44 ( + 2/+1/0/-1/-2 ) can be defined as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the total energy of the system containing the single defect and defect - free system , respectively .",

    "@xcite ) .    for calculation of the formation energy of the native point defects @xmath55 , the supercell approach has been applied .",
    "in order to minimize an interaction between a defect and its periodic replicas , the sufficiently large supercell ( 3@xmath123@xmath123 ) is used for simulation of defects .",
    "the geometry optimization procedure has been applied as for the neutral supercell ( the total energy of the system corresponds to @xmath47 ) and so after defect has been charged : @xmath46 energy has been evaluated for the defects in the different charge states @xmath44 ( + 2/+1/0/-1/-2 ) ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "an alignment of the top of the valence band ( @xmath37 ) for supercell with charged defect to that in the bulk is performed with help of the correction term @xmath54 @xcite . since for accurate calculation of the formation energy of interstitial defects",
    "the mismatch in the interlayer distance ( @xmath16=5.51  ) occurring for the lattice parameters optimized with gga in comparison to the experimental data ( @xmath16=5.07 @xcite ) is essential , the experimental value has been used for those calculations . in this case , an application of the so - called band gap error @xmath56 @xcite is required to compensate for a reduction of the band gap size @xcite . for vacancies , because of their weak interactions with the opposite layer , the formation energy would be rather insignificantly affected by the interlayer distance mismatch , and the same argument works for the vacancies appearing on the surface of the single crystal ( platelet ) .",
    "however , for interstitial defects because of their strong interaction with the opposite layer , the formation energy would be altered upon appearance on the platelet s surface . for defects on surface ,",
    "slab s thickness was four layers , its width was @xmath310  , while distance between slabs was @xmath314  .    to simulate the deficit and excess of oxygen",
    ", the pb - rich / o - poor and pb - poor / o - rich limits have been applied in evaluation of the chemical potentials .",
    "the chemical potentials have been found for the pb - rich / o - poor limit as @xmath57=@xmath58(o atom)+@xmath59 , where @xmath59 is the standard enthalpy of formation of pbo compound , while @xmath60 is determined from @xmath59=@xmath57+@xmath60 . for the pb - poor / o - rich limit",
    "the chemical potentials are @xmath60=@xmath58(pb atom)+@xmath59 and , similarly , @xmath57 is found from @xmath59=@xmath57+@xmath60 .",
    "the standard enthalpy of formation @xmath59=-2.92 ev per pb - o pair has been calculated elsewhere @xcite applying a formalism described in details earlier @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the formation energies of the different defects in the relevant charge states and our results as a function of the fermi level position for the pb - rich / o - poor and pb - poor / o - rich limits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "since the fermi level defines a probability for electron to occupy the defect state , the formation energy of the charged state is a function of fermi level position inside the band gap .",
    "as @xmath61 deviates in a range defined by @xmath59 ( in real growth conditions to be controlled by the partial pressure of reactants ) it induces a shift of the formation energies .",
    "the concentration of the defects can be estimated through their formation energies as @xmath62 exp@xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath65 k is the deposition temperature and @xmath66 is the concentration of sites available for defects to be formed .",

    "( a ) oxygen deficit ( pb - rich / o - poor limit ) .",
    "( b ) oxygen excess ( pb - poor / o - rich limit ) . ]    for the pb - rich / o - poor limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) ) , the formation energies of the o vacancy ( @xmath18 ) and the pb interstitial ( @xmath26 ) appear to be much lower than that for other defects and , therefore , these defects are expected to dominate .",
    "the defect concentrations estimated for their zero charge states are @xmath68@xmath5 for the o vacancy and @xmath69@xmath5 for the pb interstitial . for the fermi level assigned to the midgap ,",
    "the ( 0 , 1 + ) and ( 0 , 1- ) states are energetically preferable for the o vacancy and the pb interstitial , respectively . since the thermodynamic transition @xmath70 is found to occur almost at the midgap , it indicates a potential for both states to be formed during the compound growth .",
    "however , to be ionized , @xmath71 has to dispose of its electron and therefore , the appearance of the @xmath72 charge state would naturally depend on the presence of the electron acceptor . for the pb interstitial",
    ", we have calculated the formation energy for the five states ( 2 + , 1 + , 0 , 1@xmath22 , 2@xmath22 ) . since the formation energy of the ( 1- ) state that occurs when an extra electron is added , is significantly lower than that",
    "when an electron is removed ( @xmath73=3.98 ev for @xmath67 at midgap ) , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 states have been disregarded .",
    "the thermodynamic transition @xmath76 occurs close to the midgap and , therefore the charge states ( 0 , 1@xmath22 ) appear to be the preferable states . to become ionized to the ( 1@xmath22 ) state , @xmath77 has to gain an electron ( electron acceptor ) .",
    "therefore , the charge exchange between @xmath71 and @xmath77 is possible as one of them can work as an electron donor while other as an acceptor .",
    "the concentration of ionized states to manifest upon charge exchange would be limited by the defect of lower concentration , i.e. by the pb interstitial ( @xmath69@xmath5 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the balance of electrons and holes occupying both defect sites in either combination of the charge states ( @xmath71/@xmath77 or @xmath72/@xmath78 ) is always shifted to a higher population of electrons ( four electrons against two holes ) .",
    "therefore , with respect to the conductivity type , redundant electrons induced by the o vacancies would cause @xmath1-type doping of @xmath0-pbo at the pb - rich / o - poor limit to be in agreement with our previous studies @xcite . in the non - equilibrium electron gas ( photogenerated or injected carriers ) , the ionized o vacancies @xmath72 and the pb interstitials in both charge states @xmath77 , @xmath78 would work as trapping centers for electrons in the conduction band .",
    "for the pb - poor / o - rich limit , only the o interstitial , @xmath25 , possesses a low formation energy , while the formation energies of other defects ( @xmath26 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 ) are higher than 3.0 ev .",
    "in fact , the formation energy of @xmath25 being so closed to zero implies the spontaneous appearance of this defect such as the defect concentration can become equal to the concentration of the possible defect sites ( @xmath79@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "the o interstitial in its neutral charge state @xmath80 misses two electrons and , to be ionized to the charge states ( 1-/2- ) , has to acquire electrons .",
    "since the thermodynamic transition @xmath81 occurs close to the midgap , @xmath25 potentially can be formed in the charge states ( 1-,2- ) . however , because the concentration of centers of the donor type ( @xmath26 , @xmath18 ) is negligible , the o interstitial is expected to occur primary in its @xmath80 state .",
    "the @xmath80 state would act as a trap for the non - equilibrium electrons in the conduction band .",
    "therefore , under growth conditions corresponding to the oxygen excess , the high concentration of @xmath80 defects each to be occupied by two holes , would be able to cause @xmath2-type doping .",
    "moreover , the state formed by the o interstitial is characterized by a quite delocalized nature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( c ) ) : the long defect tails in combination with the high defect concentration would results in strong defect - defect interaction potentially leading to formation of the defect band .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that all investigated defects , @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 being considered in bulk @xmath0-pbo would be inherent to surface of the single crystal ( platelet ) . for some defects ,",
    "the formation energy is found to be lowered when they are placed on the platelet surface .",
    "the strongest effect is observed for the pb interstitial for which the formation energy drops by @xmath3 1.0 ev . for the vacancies , the formation energy is only affected provided they appear at the edge of the platelet ( for example , it is reduced by 0.3 ev for oxygen vacancy ) .",
    "the reduction of the formation energy at the platelet edge is a result of surface reconstruction leading to formation of the pb - o double bonds instead of single bonds .",
    "since the balance of electrons and holes occupying the defect sites is not affected by the formation of surface states , the considered phenomenon of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-doping remains valid .",
    "there is one more interesting feature to be examined , which is defect pairing . for the pb - rich / o - poor conditions",
    ", the pairing may occur between @xmath18 and @xmath26 defects , and is promoted by a lowering of the formation energy by 0.84 ev .",
    "such a pair @xmath18-@xmath26 still forms two defect levels at @xmath19(@xmath21)-@xmath20=1.22 ev and @xmath19(@xmath21)-@xmath20=0.66 ev and each level is occupied by two electrons . for the pb - poor / o - rich conditions , the interaction between @xmath25 and @xmath21 potentially can occur but because each localized state is occupied by two holes ,",
    "such interaction is repulsive . under equilibrium growth conditions ,",
    "the formation energy of @xmath21 and @xmath18 would become comparable , indicating a possibility of their pairing as well @xcite .",
    "this combination of defects is unique as it induces vanishing of the dangling bonds and , therefore , occurs without generation of a defect state inside the band gap .",
    "moreover , because the formation energy is lowered by 1.47 ev upon defect pairing , it indicates the pairing to occur not only during the compound growth but also as a post - growth migration of the o vacancy towards the pb vacancy .",
    "our study on the formation of defects in single crystal @xmath0-pbo has revealed that some defects under certain growth conditions would appear in significant concentration causing @xmath1- or @xmath2-type doping of compound . in particular , for the pb - rich / o - poor limit a formation of the @xmath18 and @xmath26 defects are found to dominate with concentrations of @xmath68@xmath5 and @xmath69@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the obtained defect concentrations are in good agreement with concentration of the localized states estimated experimentally ( @xmath82-@xmath68@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "it was established that accumulation of electrons on sites of the @xmath18 and @xmath26 defects results in @xmath1-type doping of @xmath0-pbo . for the oxygen excess created during the compound growth ( pb - poor / o - rich limit ) ,",
    "another defect is found to manifest which is the o interstitial .",
    "the concentration of @xmath25 is predicted to approach the highest limit because its formation energy is around zero , i.e. the defect concentration may become equal to the number of the possible defect sites . since each @xmath80",
    "is occupied by two holes , its high concentration would result in @xmath2-type doping of @xmath0-pbo .",
    "moreover , such low formation energy of the o interstitial might be a problem for the post - growth procedures such as annealing .",
    "we predict that annealing in an atmosphere of oxygen addressed to heal o vacancies would generate new defects such as o interstitials . with respect to the transport properties",
    ", the negative impact of the dominant defects , @xmath25 , @xmath18 and @xmath26 would become apparent because these defects induce the states close to the midgap : severe trapping of non - equilibrium electrons from the conduction band is expected .",

    "<S> first principles calculations ( gga ) have been applied to study the crystallographic defects in @xmath0-pbo in order to understand an origin of @xmath1- and @xmath2-type conductivity in otherwise undoped @xmath0-pbo . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that deposition in oxygen - deficient environment to be defined in our simulations by the pb - rich / o - poor limit stimulates a formation of o vacancies and pb interstitials both characterized by quite low formation energies @xmath3 1.0 ev . the o vacancy , being occupied by two electrons , shifts the a balance of electrons and holes between these two defects to an excess of electrons ( four electrons against two holes ) that causes @xmath1-type doping . for the pb - poor / o - rich limit , an excess of oxygen triggers the formation of the o interstitials characterized by such a low formation energy that spontaneous appearance of this defect is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the concentration of o interstitials is able to reach an extreme magnitude equal to number of the possible defect sites ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the localized state formed by the o interstitial is occupied by two holes and because there are no other defects in reasonable concentration to balance the hole redundancy , @xmath2-type doping is induced .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.5truecm    recent developments in radiation medical imaging technology impose new requirements on photoconductive materials : polycrystalline and amorphous materials are considered for application in flat panel detectors @xcite with preference given to high z ( atomic number ) polycrystalline semiconductors . among all polycrystalline materials , </S>",
    "<S> lead oxide ( @xmath0-pbo ) is the most promising candidate due to its long history of employment in optical imaging devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite such extensive application , properties of @xmath0-pbo are not well established . </S>",
    "<S> there are limited data on the transport properties : the low mobility - time product indicates poor carrier transport @xcite and , therefore , it is believed that carrier transport should be controlled by trapping on defects . for application of pbo in real time procedures such as fluoroscopy , transport characteristics are required to be optimized , for which an understanding of the nature of the defects is important . the thermal evaporation technique used for deposition of pbo layers </S>",
    "<S> @xcite presumes a deficiency of atomic oxygen ultimately leading to formation of oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the conductivity enhancement of pbo samples observed after thermal annealing in an atmosphere of oxygen supports this hypothesis @xcite . in our previous studies devoted to defect formation in @xmath0-pbo single crystal </S>",
    "<S> , we confirmed that this compound tends to loose oxygen due to the low formation energy of the oxygen vacancy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen vacancies are found to be occupied by two electrons that leads to a prediction of excess of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed @xmath1-type conductivity of the pbo layers grown under conditions of oxygen deficiency @xcite verifies our theoretical findings @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> samples characterized by excess oxygen show the exact opposite behavior : @xmath2-type conductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pb vacancies considered in our previous study @xcite , although they are occupied by two holes and the oxygen rich conditions promote their formation , can not be responsible for @xmath2-type doping because of their rather high formation energy . in order to develop the post - growth annealing procedures directed to suppression of the vacancy defects , an understanding of whether the origin of @xmath2-type conductivity is defect related </S>",
    "<S> is urgently required : the application of annealing in oxygen atmosphere becomes questionable , provided it generates new defects , while healing the oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to obtain a real picture a comprehensive study of all type of defects that can be formed under different growth conditions is required . here </S>",
    "<S> we apply first - principles methods for such a study ( the pb - rich / o - poor and pb - poor / o - rich limits of the growth conditions are considered ) with focus on an analysis of the defects being inherent to the @xmath0-pbo crystal structure , the appearance of the defect states inside the band gap , charged states and formation energies . </S>"
