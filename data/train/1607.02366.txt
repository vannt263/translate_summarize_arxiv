    "* six - state sarg04 qkd protocol . * in this section , we introduce the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol with @xmath1-photon ( @xmath2 ) source . in this protocol",
    ", there are six polarization encoding quantum states , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the six states are then arranged into twelve sets @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where the first and second states of each set correspond to logic 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the steps of the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol with a @xmath1-photon source are outlined as follows .",
    "alice sends a series of signals to bob .",
    "each pulse is chosen randomly from the twelve sets listed above , and alice randomly sends one state from each set to bob through the insecure quantum channel .",
    "bob randomly measures the incoming bit strings with one of the three bases , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "afterwards , he exploits an authenticated classical channel to announce to alice the situations where he did not register any click at his detection unit , and both of them discard these signals .",
    "alice reveals to bob the sets on which she encodes her information .",
    "bob then compares his measurement results with alice s set information .",
    "if bob s measurement result is orthogonal to one of the states in the set , he concludes that the other state has been sent , which represents a conclusive result ; he concludes an inconclusive result otherwise .",
    "he discards all the inconclusive results and broadcasts to alice which of his results are conclusive .",
    "alice selects randomly a portion of her remaining signals and announces them to bob , and bob calculates the bit error rate to test for eavesdroppers . if the bit error rate is much higher than the upper bound , they abort the protocol .",
    "they perform error correction and privacy amplification on the remaining bit string to obtain the shared secret key .    * a virtual edp - based six - state sarg04 protocol . * to estimate phase error for privacy amplification , one can construct an equivalent edp version of the six - state sarg04 protocol .",
    "first , we introduce some notations . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the eigenstates for @xmath21 and @xmath20 basis , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 ; @xmath26 is an identity operation ; @xmath27 is a @xmath28 rotation around the @xmath29 axis ; @xmath30 is a @xmath28 rotation around the @xmath31 axis . in the edp-@xmath1 protocol",
    ", alice prepares many pairs of qubits in the state @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "she then randomly rotates @xmath35 and sends system @xmath36 to bob , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . upon receiving the qubits ,",
    "bob first applies a random reverse rotation @xmath39 , before performing a filtering operation defined by a klaus operator @xmath40 .",
    "then alice and bob would compare their indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 via public communication , and keep the qubit pairs with @xmath43 and @xmath44 when bob s filtering operation is successful .",
    "they then choose some states randomly as test bits and measure them in the @xmath20 basis , and compare their results publicly to estimate the bit error rate and the information acquired by eve . finally , they utilize the corresponding calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) code to correct the bit and phase errors@xcite , and perform a final @xmath20 measurement on their qubits to obtain the secure key .    the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol is equivalent to the edp - based six - state sarg04 qkd protocol , except for the only difference , a @xmath45 total rotation around @xmath22 basis . by analyzing the virtual edp - based six - state sarg04 qkd protocol ,",
    "we give the exact phase error rate formula , whose detailed analysis is provided in the methods section .",
    "for the case with a single - photon source , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the phase error rate and bit error rate , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is the probability that both bit flip and phase shift occur , which restricts the mutual information between phase error and bit error .",
    "for the case of a two - photon source , the relationship can be given by @xmath50 for the case with a three - photon source , the error rates can be written as @xmath51 for the case with a four - photon source , the error rates are calculated by @xmath52 where @xmath53    now we reexamine the four - state sarg04 qkd protocol@xcite , and we find that the mutual information between bit error and phase error of a two - photon source is not zero .",
    "the expression can be given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 from which we can see that this phase error rate formula is the same as the result in ref .",
    "the secure key rate of the edp - based qkd using one - way classical communication can be given by@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the binary shannon entropy , @xmath58 is the conditional shannon entropy function shown in the methods section .",
    "we calculate the secure key rates versus the bit error rates for the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol with single - photon , two - photon , three - photon and four - photon sources , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . for comparison , we also calculate the secure key rate versus bit error rate for bb84 protocol@xcite , six - state protocol@xcite , and four - state sarg04 qkd protocol@xcite . for the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol",
    ", one can extract the secure key rate from @xmath1-photon component when the bit error rate is no larger than @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) , and @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 ) .",
    "for the four - state sarg04 qkd protocol with our calculation , one can extract the secure key rate from two - photon component when the bit error rate is lower than @xmath67 .",
    "we can see that the bit error rate thresholds of single - photon and two - photon in the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol are the same with the results in ref .",

    "randomized weak coherent state sources@xcite , we study the secure key rate with infinite decoy states@xcite , which can be given by @xmath68+q_{2}[1-h(e_{p_{2}}|e_{b_{2}})]+q_{3}[1-h(e_{p_{3}}|e_{b_{3}})]\\\\ & + q_{4}[1-h(e_{p_{4}}|e_{b_{4}})]-q_{\\mu}fh(e_{\\mu } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the gain of the @xmath70-photon signal states which can be estimated by the decoy - state method ; @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is the phase ( bit ) error for the @xmath70-photon state ; @xmath73 and @xmath74 are , respectively , the total gain and quantum bit error rate under signal states with @xmath75 intensity , and can both be acquired directly through the experiment .",

    "[ f2 ] . in our simulation , we use the following parameters : the detection efficiency is @xmath76 , the dark count rate of each pulse is @xmath77 , and the intrinsic loss coefficient of standard telecom fibre is @xmath78db / km . these values are adopted from the 200 km mdiqkd experiment data@xcite .",
    "we also set the misalignment error rate to @xmath79 , the efficiency of error correction is @xmath80 . for comparison",
    ", we also give the secure key rates of bb84 qkd protocol@xcite , four - state sarg04 qkd protocol@xcite , and the rrdps qkd protocol@xcite with the case of infinite decoy states .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) , the secure transmission distance of the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol is more than 270 km , farther than the four - state sarg04 qkd protocol because of the higher bit error rate threshold in the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol .",
    "the case of finite decoy states is considered in the fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) .",
    "by exploiting one weak decoy state and vacuum state , one can extract the secure key from single - photon component ( see methods ) .",
    "however , the secure key rate and secure transmission distance of the six - state and four - state sarg04 qkd protocol are all smaller than those of bb84 protocol since the bit error rate of bb84 protocol is small and the efficiency of basis shift is high@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , since the security of rrdps qkd does not rely on signal disturbance monitoring , in our case where @xmath81 is low , the secure key of rrdps qkd is much lower than qubit - based qkd protocols .",
    "for each qkd protocol , how to extract as much secure key as possible is a critical task . here ,",
    "we present the exact relations between the phase error and bit error as well as the mutual information parameters with single - photon , two - photon , three - photon , and four - photon sources . through restricting the mutual information , we have obtained higher bit error rate thresholds of three - photon , four - photon six - state sarg04 and two - photon four - state sarg04 qkd protocol . in the quantum digital signature protocol with @xmath82-participant@xcite ( one signer and @xmath83 recipients )",
    ", the signer will prepares @xmath83 copies of quantum states and send a copy of quantum states to each recipient through the insecure quantum channel . to guarantee the security against the forgery attack of untruthful recipient",
    ", the honest recipient needs to estimate the information leak of his received quantum states , which will correlate to the phase error rate of qkd with @xmath83-photon sources .",
    "the security analysis of the four - state and six - state sarg04 qkd protocol with two - photon sources has been used for the three - participants quantum digital signature@xcite .",
    "similarly , we can expect that the security analysis of the six - state sarg04 qkd protocol with three and four - photon sources can also be used for the four - participant and five - participant quantum digital signature .",
    "* the six - state sarg04 protocol with single - photon source . * we consider the following four orthogonal bell states @xmath84 alice prepares the initial quantum state @xmath85 .",
    "if eve performs no attacks and bob does a successful filtering operation , the quantum state shared by alice and bob can be given by @xmath86 here , we consider that eve can perform the most general attack on all qubits transmitted through the insecure quantum channel . by tracing out all other qubits , we can focus on one qubit state .",
