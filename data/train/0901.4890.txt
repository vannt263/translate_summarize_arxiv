    "due to its clean experimental environment the international linear collider ( ilc ) offers the possibility to look for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in a model - independent way .",
    "this has been pointed out in  @xcite . in this",
    "study the expected sensitivity to such a wimp signal , the achievable mass resolution and the influence of beam polarisation are investigated using a full detector simulation of the international large detector ( ild ) of the ilc .",
    "it is assumed that the cosmic dark matter ( dm ) component is only due to one new type of particle , and that the relic density is determined by pair annihilation of wimps into sm particles .",
    "these annihilations may produce an @xmath1 pair ( @xmath2 ) with an unknown branching fraction @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is strongly motivated by recent pamela results  @xcite . the total annihilation cross section @xmath5 is then determined by the observed . the annihilation cross section required to match",
    "the observed relic density is in the order of a few pb  @xcite .",
    "using crossing relations one can derive the expected cross section for the reverse process , i.  e. @xmath6 , which could be observable at the ilc .",
    "the resulting cross section contains as free parameters :    * the @xmath1 branching fraction @xmath3 * the mass of the wimp @xmath7 and its spin @xmath8 * the angular momentum @xmath9 of the dominant partial wave ( @xmath9 corresponds to the spin of the exchange particle in the annihilation ( production ) process ) .    since the produced wimps leave the detector without any further interaction an additional photon from isr is required ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the main background is the radiative neutrino pair production @xmath11 .",
    "this reaction is mediated dominantly by t - channel if the center of mass energy is significantly above the @xmath12-pole .",
    "therefore is strongly reducible depending on the polarisation state of the initial electrons and positrons .",
    "+ in this model - independent approach no constraints are imposed on the helicity structure of the wimp couplings to electrons , which therefore enter the production cross section as a new free parameter .",
    "we consider three different scenarios for the helicity structure of the wimp couplings :    * the same as the sm charged current interaction , i.  e. only @xmath13 is nonzero * parity and helicity are conserved : @xmath14 * opposite to the sm charged current interaction , only @xmath15 is nonzero .    in the last two cases a significant enhancement of the signal to background ratio",
    "is expected if electrons ( and positrons ) beams are appropriatly polarised .",
    "for the sm @xmath16 background the slac sm whizard event sample  @xcite is used .",
    "this sample is generated with the whizard event generator including beamstrahlung and beam energy spread from guinea pig for nominal ilc beam parameters .",
    "each @xmath11 event contains up to two _ additional _ isr photons .",
    "the sample size corresponds to 10 fb@xmath17 of luminosity at @xmath18 gev .",
    "the background sample is reweighted with respect to the energy and polar angle of the detected photon according to the wimp production and background cross sections .",
    "the benefit of this method is that a full signal sample can be obtained for all investigated combinations of cross section parameters with only one simulation and reconstruction cycle , reducing the amount of processing time significantly .",
    "since the predicted signal cross section assumes only one photon to be radiated , the center of mass energy of the hard subprocess is used for the application of weights .",
    "+ the event sample is then fed into the full mokka 06 - 06-p03 ild detector simulation ( detector model ldcprime_02sc ) with a 3.5 tesla magnetic field , and reconstructed with marlinreco using the pandora particle flow algorithm ( pflow )  @xcite .",

    "this behaviour is quantified in figure [ fig : gamma_ratio](a ) showing the average ratio @xmath20 of the reconstructed photon candidate s energy to the photon energy on generator level .",

    "this lowers the ratio @xmath20 especially at high energies ( black triangles ) . this effect can be compensated by applying a simple merging procedure .",

    "if wimps are observed at the ilc , their mass can be determined from the recoil mass distribution of the photons : @xmath37 figure  [ fig : mass ] shows an example for the recoil mass distribution for a 180  gev wimp with both beams polarised . the wimp signal shown in red ( dark grey ) on top of the sm neutrino background kicks in at @xmath38 360  gev . from this distribution the wimp mass",
