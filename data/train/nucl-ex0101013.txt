    "a calibration of a time projection chamber ( tpc ) is performed for two main purposes : the _ gain correction _ , which is needed to compensate variations in the front - end electronics ( fee ) and in the gas gain , and the _ energy calibration _ , which is performed in order to determine the amount of electric charge that is measured at a known energy deposition in the chamber .",
    "the gain of the pre - amplifier electronics varies from chip to chip ( see also section  [ measurements ] ) and within a chip from channel to channel .",
    "moreover , variations in gas gain may occur due to inhomogeneties of the electric field and geometrical non - uniformities .",
    "a straightforward and effortless relative gain correction for the pre - amplifier electronics can be perfomed by a so - called pulser calibration .",
    "this is done by injecting calibrated charge pulses into the anode or gating grid wires of the multi - wire proportional chambers ( readout chambers).[pulsercalib ] each pulse induces a charge on each cathode pad @xmath1 , resulting in a charge signal @xmath2 which is proportional to the channel s response .",
    "multiplicative calibration constants @xmath3 are then obtained by dividing the average charge per pad @xmath4 ( @xmath5 number of pads ) by the charge induced on an individual pad : @xmath6    each measured charge per pad @xmath7 ( i.e. integrated adc channels ) then gets multiplied by this calibration constant in order to obtain the calibrated charge : @xmath8    however , pulsing the anode wires induces a signal on all pads simultaneously , producing a large current load on each fee channel which may result in a modification of the electronics response .",
    "thus , the pulser calibration can only be considered as a first step in the calibration procedure .",
    "it is not possible to perform an absolute energy calibration by a pulser calibration only .",
    "therefore , an alternative calibration method using a radioactive source has to be considered .",
    "although particle identification via @xmath9 measurement is difficult with the star ftpc ( * ? ?",
    "* sect.6.6 ) , an energy calibration is useful to optimize the accuracy of the position measurement .",
    "it can easily be done with a radioactive source such as which is injected into the chamber gas .",
    "an electron emitted during the decay process of ( see section  [ decayprocess ] ) produces secondary electrons by ionization in the gas , where the number of produced electrons is proportional to the initial decay energy ( i.e. the kinetic energy of the primary electron ) .",
    "since the decay energies of suitable sources are relatively low ( @xmath10 ) , the primary electron is stopped very quickly , and the secondary electrons emerge from virtually one point .",
    "these secondary electrons are then drifted by an electric drift field to the readout chambers where they are amplified at the anode wires , and the charge signal from the gas amplification is detected at the cathode pads .",
    "the decay energies of the radioactive source are known , and thus the corresponding energies can be assigned to the peaks of the measured charge spectra . starting from a distinct reference peak , the energy that corresponds to a measured charge @xmath11",
    "is then calculated by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy and @xmath14 is the measured charge of the reference peak . however , because the highest decay energy of is relatively high compared to the energies of a few kev deposited by a minimum ionizing particle , the anode voltage @xmath15 has to be reduced from the value suitable for minimum ionization .",
    "the results from the energy calibration must then be extrapolated to higher gain voltages .",
    "as the dependence of the amplification on the anode voltage has been measured , such an extrapolation is accurate .",
    "further applications of the krypton calibration are a cross - check of the pulser calibration and an investigation of gas flow effects in the chamber by studying the location of krypton decays at the beginning of the injection . moreover",
    ", a calibration is needed to check the detector linearity over a wide energy range , and to monitor the long term detector stability .",
    "the high track density in the forward rapidity regions of the star experiment covered by the ftpcs ( pseudorapidity range of @xmath16 ) requires a special design for the tracking detectors in these regions .",
    "in contrast to conventional time projection chambers , the two forward tpcs of the star detector use radial drift fields , and the curved readout chambers are part of the outer cylinder walls . the compactness of the ftpcs ( 60 cm diameter and 120 cm length ) with only 22 cm drift length and the use of a cool gas provides a very good position resolution ( 150 @xmath17 m ) and two - track separation ( 1 mm ) @xcite . in order to minimize the number of readout channels without compromising the detector performance the surface",
    "is covered only partially by cathode pads .",
    "there are 10 padrows per ftpc , with 960 pads each .",
    "the length of one pad is 20 mm ( in @xmath18 direction , where @xmath18 points along the beam pipe ) , and the pad pitch is 1.9 mm ( in azimuthal direction @xmath19 ) .",
    "the distance between the padrows is intermittently 65 mm and 85 mm . for further details on the star ftpc ,",
    "see @xcite .    as",
    "the padrows are not adjacent to each other , a problem arises when localized charge clusters from radioactive decays are to be detected .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ padrow ] , only a fraction of the cluster charge can be detected by the pads when the cluster is located at the border of a padrow .",
    "the question whether a calibration with a radioactive source can nevertheless be done triggered a systematic investigation on the practicability of a calibration with radioactive krypton .",
    "is a stable isotope produced from which decays by electron capture with a mean lifetime of 124 days .",
    "the decay scheme @xcite is shown in figure  [ rbdecay ] .",
    "the ground state of is not reached directly in the decay but via nuclear transitions from intermediate excited levels .",
    "the relevant level for drift chamber calibration is the isomeric ( metastable ) 41.6kev state .",
    "it is fed down from two higher levels in 76% of all decays and has a lifetime long enough ( @xmath20h ) for the to be introduced and distributed in the drift chamber before it decays .",
    "the isomeric state decays entirely by an e3 nuclear de - excitation transition to the 9.4kev level with a transition energy @xmath21 of 32.2kev .",
    "this short - lived state then decays immediately ( @xmath22ns ) to the ground state with @xmath21 = 9.4kev .",
    "in contrast to other common calibration sources like or , almost no low energy photons are produced since both transitions from the 41.6kev and the 9.4kev states proceed almost entirely by internal conversion ( ic ) with ratios of electron - to - photon emission of @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath25 of an ic electron is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the atomic binding energy of the electron .",
    "the subsequent atomic de - excitation of the electron hole produces either x - rays or auger electrons with an energy equal to @xmath27 .    for the 41.6kev - to-9.4kev transition",
    "the internal @xmath28 conversion occurs predominantly on an electron in an outer ( l , m , n ) shell , the total electron emission probability from such shells being 77% @xcite .",
    "the binding energies for the outer shells are small @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , the de - excitation of an outer - shell hole leads in most cases to the emission of an auger electron rather than an x - ray .",
    "therefore practically the full energy @xmath21 of 32.2kev is carried away by electrons and can be collected . if , however , the internal conversion occurs in the k shell ( 23% of the cases ) an ic electron with an energy @xmath25 of 17.8 , 18.1 , 19.5 or 19.6kev is produced , corresponding to four k sub - levels with binding energies of 14.3 , 14.1 , 12.7 and 12.6kev @xcite , respectively , according to eq .",
    "( [ kinetic ] ) .",
    "in addition , the de - excitation of the k - shell hole yields x - rays or auger electrons with an energy equal to the binding energy .    for the 9.4kev - to - ground state transition the low transition energy allows only internal conversion on an outer - shell electron , so that practically the full transition energy of 9.4kev is carried away by the ic electron ( 95% of the cases ) or by the escaping @xmath28 ( 5% ) .    for more details on the released energies and on the branching fractions ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the overall decay spectrum has been simulated , using the branching fractions in table 4 of @xcite and assuming a resolution of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the width of a gaussian .",
    "the simulated spectrum is shown in figure  [ krsim1 ] ; it is composed of five parts :    * the strong peak at 41.6kev is due to the electrons from the dominant modes of the two - step decay of the 41.6kev isomeric state via the 9.4kev state . because of the short lifetime of the 9.4kev state the two decay energies of 32.2kev and 9.4kev are deposited in the majority of cases at the same location such that the total decay energy is collected in a single cluster . * the smaller peak around 30kev comes from two contributions : ( a ) electrons with @xmath25 = 32.2kev from the 41.6kev - to-9.4kev transition when the 9.4kev @xmath28 escapes ; ( b ) k - shell ic electrons ( @xmath32 19.5kev ) together with ic electrons from the decay of the 9.4kev state at the same location , leading to a total energy deposition of @xmath33 29kev . *",
    "the very small accumulation around 20kev is due to k - shell ic electrons ( @xmath34 19.5kev ) when the 9.4kev @xmath28 escapes . *",
    "the peak at 12.7kev is produced by the conversion of k - shell x - rays in the chamber gas , away from the location of their origin .",
    "* the peak at 9.4kev results from either the conversion of the escaped 9.4 kev @xmath28 in the gas or the 9.4kev electron energy , separated from the preceding 32.2kev transition .",
    "figure  [ krsim2 ] shows a more detailed simulation , where partially detected clusters caused by the pad geometry , diffusion , the detector resolution , and cut criteria comparable to those in the experiment were considered .",
    "the 41.6kev peak is clearly visible while the several peaks around 30kev as well as the 9.4kev and the 12.7kev peaks are hardly separable .",
    "moreover , the shape of the low energy part of the spectrum is strongly affected by the chosen threshold .",
    "the isomeric state is a very useful isotope for calibrating a time projection chamber for several reasons : in contrast to other frequently used calibration sources such as , is a gas which can be distributed over the chamber volume using the existing gas system .",
    "therefore , no laborious unmounting of the chamber and installation of fe sources is necessary .",
    "the mean lifetime of is short enough to ensure the chamber to operate normally again after a reasonably short time , i.e. once a few half - lives have passed after cutting off the krypton supply to the chamber . if required , the gas can be left within the closed gas system until the radioactivity subsides . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean lifetime of the isomeric state is long enough for a sufficient number of subsequent decays to occur inside the chamber .",
    "krypton s parent isotope @xmath35rb has a sufficiently long mean lifetime ( @xmath36d ) , is a solid , and thus may be mounted as a foil inside a bypass line of the gas system .",
    "as it is not possible to trigger on the krypton decays , a random trigger must be used .",
    "the decay rate must be high enough to ensure good statistics within a reasonable time ( an estimate of the number of events needed is carried out at the end of section  [ measurements ] ) .",
    "due to random triggering there is no information on the decay position in the drift direction .",
    "therefore , to obtain a clean spectrum , absorption ( mainly caused by oxygen pollution in the gas ) must be smalls , 17% of the electrons are absorbed @xcite . ] .",
    "as neither the star ftpc nor the ftpc readout electronics were completed when the measurements were performed , a small test - setup using the na49 readout electronics @xcite was constructed . for this test - setup ,",
    "the same materials and gas - mixture ( ar / co@xmath37 50/50 ) as for the ftpc , and a pad geometry comparable to the ftpc ( two non - adjacent padrows with 16 pads each ) were used .",
    "the major differences between the test - setup and the ftpc was the axial drift field ( in contrast to the radial drift field of the ftpc ) and the planar readout chamber . however , the charge deposited on the pads is hardly affected by the drift field geometry and the cluster sizes were comparable to those measured in a test tpc with a radial drift field . for details on the test - setup and the measurements ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the calibration was performed in three steps : the pulser calibration , the calibration with , and the calibration with .",
    "the pulser calibration is described earlier in section  [ pulsercalib ] .",
    "the amplification factors of the 16 channels per preamplifier / shaper chip decrease characteristically with increasing channel number @xmath1 ; they differ by up to 15% .",
    "this behavior is a property of the architecture of the na49 fee chips and is not observed in the ftpc electronics where the fluctuation of the amplification factor is below 3% .",
    "thus , a pad - wise calibration was necessary for the test - setup but might not be needed for the calibration of the ftpc . however , the pulse shape of the ftpc electronics is affected by the current load on the chip .",
    "the rise time of the pulse is reduced as the number of pulsed channels increases @xcite which will affect the total integrated cluster charge .",
    "thus , a cross - check of the pulser calibration has to be performed .    for the measurements with the source ,",
    "two aluminum strips doped with were mounted at the cathode plate of the drift field cage , opposite to the two padrows .",
    "decays via electron capture to @xmath38mn which subsequently emits an x - ray photon from the k - shell with an energy of 6kev .",
    "this photon may ionize an argon atom in the gas which releases an electron from the k - shell , which has a binding energy of 3.2kev .",
    "in addition , either auger electrons or an escaping x - ray photon with an energy of 3.2kev are emitted , the latter being responsible for the 2.8kev escape peak @xcite .",
    "the supplementary calibration using was performed for several reasons :    * a cross - check of the pulser calibration and a first order energy calibration was needed to tune the anode voltage for the krypton measurements . * determining the widths of the 6kev main peak and of the 3kev escape peak gave an accurate measurement of the chamber resolution . *",
    "a comparison of the gas amplification at anode voltages in the operating range of the ftpc ( 1700v to 1800v ) was required . *",
    "the clear fe spectrum allowed a straightforward determination of suitable cut criteria in order to reduce noise .",
    "the electron energy deposition of roughly corresponds to the energy deposition of a minimally ionizing particle .",
    "thus , it was possible to perform an energy calibration at the ftpc s operating anode voltage of @xmath39  1750v .",
    "in addition , further measurements at voltages from 1700v to 1800v were carried out .",
    "these results were extrapolated to lower voltages in order to find the anode voltage where the complete krypton spectrum can be measured without electronics saturation caused by the high decay energies of .    for each pad a separate fe spectrum was measured and a combined fit of the two peaks was performed ( see figure  [ fespec ] ) . for the calculation of the calibration factors only the position of the 6kev peak",
    "was considered .",
    "the width of the peak and hence the detector resolution were determined to be @xmath4012% .",
    "the positions of the fitted gaussians on the charge spectra of each pad ( except the marginal pads ) is shown as a function of the pad number in figure  [ feladung ] . by applying the fe calibration factors from a reference measurement at 1750v to measurements at different anode voltages ,",
    "the consistency of the fe calibration and thus the expected precision for the krypton calibration was investigated ( see figure  [ fekaladung ] , where only statistical errors are shown ) .",
    "the resulting uncertainty is determined to be @xmath412% .",
    "the comparison of the calibration factors obtained with the pulser and the iron source shows notable differences .",
    "the drop in amplification with increasing channel number is smaller for calibration using the fe source ( @xmath4211% ) than for the pulser calibration ( @xmath4215% ) .",
    "this is due to the lower current demand of the amplifying electronics in the case of the fe measurement because only a few pads receive charge signals .",
    "a thorough investigation of cut criteria showed that constraints on the cluster size in drift direction @xmath43 and in @xmath19 direction ( see coordinate system in figure  [ padrow ] ) significantly improve the spectra and reduce noise and background .",
    "an effective background rejection is of great importance for the following calibration with .",
    "moreover , clusters located at the marginal pads of each padrow were rejected .      in the first step ,",
    "krypton spectra were recorded at high anode voltages ( 1600v and 1700v ) , focusing on the 9.4kev peak .",
    "the calibration factors from the fe reference measurement were applied to the data and the spectra from the individual pads were combined to one spectrum . by this means , the accuracy of the extrapolation of the gas gain measurements with fe from high anode voltages to lower voltages was checked .",
    "this extrapolation was correct within an error @xmath44 , which includes statistical and systematical errors .",
    "the optimum anode voltage for collecting the complete krypton spectrum was determined to be 1500v .    in the second step ,",
    "a high statistics run at 1500v was carried out in order to allow a pad - wise calibration with the 41.6kev peak . in some of the high energy decays ,",
    "several electrons are produced consecutively in a short time span .",
    "this results in charge clusters with multiple peaks . as the summed electron energy is relevant",
    ", a special cluster finder was used that does not deconvolute overlapping clusters , but sums up the total charge .",
    "the cuts determined by the fe measurements were applied and the calibration constants were then obtained by fitting a simple gaussian to the upper part of each spectrum ( see figure  [ krpad ] ) .",
    "this calibration was repeated iteratively several times since the cluster charge is summed up from several pads with different calibration factors although the resulting charge is assigned to the spectrum of the central pad .",
    "finally , a total krypton spectrum was obtained by combining the calibrated spectra of the single pads ( except the marginal pads ) .",
    "this measured krypton spectrum is in good agreement with the simulation ( compare figures  [ krsim2 ] and [ krresult ] ) .",
    "the position of the peaks were determined by a combined fit to a satisfactory precision .",
    "both the linearity and the accuracy of the fitting procedure were checked in the following way : the maximum of the high energy peak was assigned to an energy of 41.6kev .",
    "the energies of the other peaks were then calculated from their fitted positions , assuming linearity .",
    "the deviations of the energies thus obtained from the expected values were @xmath45% .",
    "the relative width @xmath46 of the 41.6kev peak ( i.e. the resolution ) was determined to be 10% .",
    "the amplification in the gas is sensitive to the density which changes due to temperature and atmospheric pressure variations .",
    "therefore the measurements were performed in an air - conditioned room .",
    "as the atmospheric pressure was not monitored during the measurements , a more precise calibration can be attained when appropriate correction factors are applied to the data .    in order to obtain a spectrum where the 41.6kev peak can be fitted precisely , at least 1000 decay events that fulfill the cut criteria are required . with moderate cut criteria ,",
    "80% of the events pass the cuts and thus 1250 events have to be recorded .",
    "consequently , if a pad - wise calibration of the ftpc s 19200 pads is required , a total of @xmath47 events is needed .",
    "for a chip - wise calibration ( each chip reads out 16 pads ) this number decreases to @xmath48 events . assuming that the data can be written with a rate of 15hz and that there is one krypton decay detected per trigger , it takes about 28hours to record @xmath48 events .",
    "it was shown that a calibration with krypton-83 m is a very useful and convenient calibration method for the star ftpc .",
    "its practicability is not affected by the ftpc s pad geometry where the cathode is not completely covered with pads . with this method ,",
    "both a compensation of deviations in amplification within 2% and a precise energy calibration can be obtained .",
    "the energy resolution was determined to be @xmath49 ."
