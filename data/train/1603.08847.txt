    "muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) experiments make use of polarized muons , which thermalized in the sample , act as a magnetic spin microprobe or as a hydrogen - like probe in the host material .",
    "muons provide unique information at local atomic level on physical properties of matter and are used to study a variety of static and dynamic phenomena in superconductivity , magnetism , material science , radical chemistry , semiconductor physics and many other fields .",
    "they give information unavailable to other techniques so that muon studies are often complementing those involving other methods .",
    "high pressure research has become one of the most significant area in @xmath0sr and is a major tool in understanding the properties of different phases of matter and their interplay .",
    "this is best exemplified in the role of magnetism in many unconventional superconductors , where pressure can drive the system from one state to another and where the specific local information of @xmath0sr can help to identify on one hand different magnetic states ( ordered , short range ordered or disordered ) and how they coexist or compete with superconductivity at nanoscale and , on the other hand , to quantify the effects on the strength and structure of superconductivity , such as the determining the superfluid density and the gap symmetry and structure .",
    "the importance of this technique has led to the development of dedicated instruments .",
    "the instrument called gpd ( general purpose decay instrument ) and the associated beam - line at psi represent the state of the art of the tools available for pressure studies in @xmath0sr ; to enhance the field of application a continuous effort is being invested in improving the relevant parameters for an experiment such as pressure and temperature range , signal to background level and minimum sample quantity required .    in this review paper",
    "we summarize the status of high - presssure studies in @xmath0sr .",

    "the muon is an elementary particle , positively or negatively charged , with spin 1/2 and lifetime @xmath2  @xmath0s .",
    "@xmath0sr makes mostly use of the positive muons , which can be produced with very high polarization .",
    "implanted in a solid sample they very quickly thermalize at a generally interstitial position of the lattice where they act as a local magnetic probe . the possibility to use muons as microprobe of matter",
    "was predicted already in 1957 in the seminal work of l.r .",
    "garwin et al .",
    "reporting about  observations of the failure of conservation of parity and charge conjugation in meson decays : the magnetic moment of the free muon `` @xcite , where they recognized the potential of polarized muons and wrote : ' ' it seems possible that polarized positive and negative muons will become a powerful tool for exploring magnetic fields in nuclei , atoms , and interatomic regions  .",
    "muons are obtained from the decay of positive pions ( @xmath3 ) . at psi",
    "the pions are generated by bombarding two graphite targets with an intense beam of protons with 590 mev kinetic energy at a present maximum current of 2.2 ma .",
    "because of the parity violating pion decay only left - handed @xmath4 exist so that the decay muons have the spin antiparallel to their momentum in the pion rest frame .",
    "this property allows to obtaining polarized beams . presently , there are worldwide four facilities : psi ( switzerland ) and triumf ( canada ) , delivering continuous beams and isis ( uk ) and j - parc ( japan ) , delivering pulsed beams . in these facilities",
    "beam lines have been optimized to transport polarized muons to dedicated instruments where @xmath0sr experiments under different experimental conditions are performed .",
    "the @xmath0sr technique is based on the observation of the time evolution of the muon spin polarization @xmath5 of an ensemble of muons after their implantation into a sample ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the direct observation of the muon spin dynamics is possible due to the parity violating muon decay .",
    "positive muons decay into a positron , muon antineutrino and electron neutrino ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the positron is preferentially emitted along the direction of the muon spin at a moment of the decay ( decay asymmetry ) .",
    "thus , by measuring the direction and the timing of a significant number of decay positrons ( typically several millions per detector ) it is possible to directly follow the time evolution of the polarization of a muon ensemble .    sr experiment . ( a ) overview of the experimental setup .",
    "spin polarized muons with spin @xmath8 parallel to the momentum @xmath9 are implanted in the sample placed between the forward ( f ) and the backward ( b ) positron detectors .",
    "a clock is started when the incoming muon traverses the start detector ( s ) and stopped by the decay positron detected in detector f or b. ( b ) histograms of detected positrons @xmath10 and @xmath11 as a function of time for the forward and backward detector , respectively .",
    "( c ) the asymmetry signal calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_musr_asymmetry ] ) . ]    the basic principle of a @xmath0sr experiment at the high pressure setup at psi is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : msr_schematic ] . at the time of the implantation into the sample , a clock triggered by the muon traversing detector s is started .",
    "after the very quick thermalization , the muons spin starts to precess with the larmor frequency @xmath12 ( @xmath13mhz / t is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon ) in the local magnetic field @xmath14 ( @xmath15vector sum of external and internal magnetic field ) until it decays with lifetime of @xmath16s and emits a positron preferentially in the direction of the spin at the time of decay .",
    "the latter is then detected by one of the positron - detectors which stops the clock . repeating this procedure for several @xmath17 muons , histograms ( @xmath0sr time spectra )",
    "are generated .",
    "for the initial spin orientation of the muon parallel to its momentum ( as is the case for the energetic muons used for pressure studies ) , the spin rotation / relaxation can be observed using two positron counters mounted on the opposite sides of the sample in the forward @xmath18 and the backward @xmath19 detector(f / b denotes forward / backward with respect to the initial spin direction ) .",
    "the number of positrons detected by each counter as a function of time reflects the time dependence of the muon spin polarisation along the axis of observation @xmath20 defined by the two detectors : @xmath21\\cdot(1 \\pm a_{\\rm 0}p(t){n}_{\\rm f(b)}),\\ ] ] where @xmath22 @xmath23 is the experimentally observable maximum decayasymmetry at @xmath6 and the average is over the muon ensemble implanted in the sample .",
    "its value depends on the details of the experimental configuration and factors , such as the detector solid angle and efficiency , absorption and scattering of positrons in the material .",
    "it typically lies between 0.25 and 0.3 , slightly lower than the intrinsic asymmetry of the muon decay , which is 1/3 .",
    "the signal corresponding to the time evolution of the muon spin polarisation can be directly extracted by looking at the so called asymmetry function @xmath24 , determined as the difference of the signals observed by the two counters , normalised by their sum : @xmath25 the parameter @xmath26 takes into account the different solid angle and efficiency of the f and b positron - detectors and is calibrated at the beginning of the experiment .",
    "the quantities @xmath24 or @xmath5 contain all the information about the interaction of the muon spin ( or magnetic moment ) with its local environment and provide therefore the physical information about the investigated system .",
    "generally two different magnetic field configurations are used : the transverse - field ( tf ) and the longitudinal ( lf ) configuration . in the tf - configuration",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath27 is applied perpendicular to the initial muon polarization , whereas in lf-@xmath0sr the field is applied along the initial muon spin direction ( see fig .",

    "in this section we describe the @xmath0e1 beam line , delivering high energetic polarized positive muons , and the gpd instrument .      in conventional @xmath0sr experiments in bulk materials",
    "the so - called surface muons are used .",
    "they are obtained from pions decaying at rest near the surface of the production target and hence their name . as a consequence of the two - body decay",
    "they are fully polarized and have a kinetic energy of 4.1 mev and a momentum of 29.8 mev / c , so that beams based on this process are nearly monochromatic and 100% polarized .",
    "their range in matter corresponds to @xmath28 mg/@xmath29 ( _ e.g. _ in cu with density 8.96  g/@xmath30 this amounts to 0.20.3  mm only ) . to be able to traverse the cell walls and stop in the sample material placed inside a pressure cell ,",
    "more energetic muons are needed .",
    "this is achieved by collecting muons , which are the product of pions decaying in flight , so that the total momentum of the muons is the relativistic vector sum of the pion momentum and of the intrinsic momentum from the decay .",
    "the polarization of such a high energy muon beam ( decay muon beam line ) in the laboratory frame is about 80% .",

    "the beam optics consist of magnetic elements to transport and focus the beam ( quadrupoles , q ) to the instrument and select the momentum ( dipoles a ) .",
    "slits ( f ) are used to adjust beam size , intensity and momentum width .",
    "pions produced in the thick target e in the forward direction are extracted at 8@xmath32 and collected over a small solid angle using a triplet of half quadrupoles .",
    "the first dipole magnet ask81 selects the momentum of the pions , which enter a 8  m long decay channel section consisting of a superconducting solenoid with a longitudinal field of @xmath33  t. a large fraction of pions with not too high momentum decay in the channel . in this respect",
    "the solenoid may be viewed as an extended muon source .",
    "the second and third dipole magnets together with the slit system perform a muon momentum and momentum width selection . usually , only the muons emitted parallel ( forward ) or antiparallel ( backward ) to the muon momentum are selected , in order to obtain a large degree of polarization , which in the laboratory frame is limited to about 80% .",
    "note that opposite to the surface  muons having spins oriented antiparallel to their momentum , the backward  muons generally used for pressure @xmath0e1 have spins parallel to the momentum ( see also figs .",

    "the finite dispersion of the beam momentum has to be convoluted with the natural  longitudinal and transverse straggling of the muons as a consequence of energy loss and scattering while crossing the shields of the cryostat , pressure cell walls and thermalizing in the sample",
    ". these effects amount to a spread of the order of a few millimeters , and limit the minimum possible dimension of the beam spot at the sample .",
    "moreover , the size of the beam is also momentum dependent .",
    "obtaining the optimum values of the beam momentum , which also depends of the particular choice of the pressure cell ( see below ) is therefore a key operation , which is performed at the beginning of a measuring series . summarizing :    * samples of relative large dimensions are required ( @xmath1 150 mm@xmath44 ) in order to have a sizable signal from the sample inside the pressure cell .",

    "development at psi has concentrated on improving the characteristics of this type of cells within the boundary condition to use them in an existing sample and cryogenic environment ( which limits the maximum outer diameter of the pressure cell to about 26  mm ) . *",
    "our experimental tests reveal that more than 50% of the muons can be stopped in the sample by using a piston - cylinder pressure cell with @xmath52  mm inner diameter and about 30% for @xmath53  mm cell . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath52  mm cells sustain less pressure than the @xmath53  mm ones .",
    "thus the choice of the specific pressure cell will be dictated by the experimental requirements .",
    "several parameters are determinant to perform successful @xmath0sr measurements under pressure .",
    "the most important are the availability of a large sample volume and hydrostatic pressure conditions . in addition",
    ", low temperatures ( _ i.e. _ sub - kelvin ) are generally required to study several relevant condensed matter topics .",
    "another factor is the possibility to perform pressure scans without actually opening the cell .",
    "in addition to the obvious time saving , which is essential when using a costly particle beam , this latter point is important ( i ) for calibration reasons : each opening of the cell may lead to a slight change of the sample position , and/or cause a redistribution of the sample pieces in case of a multi - parts sample , which would require a new time - consuming calibration ; ( ii ) the physical properties of the sample may change during each fresh pressurization .",
    "all the above mentioned points require the use of piston - cylinder pressure cells for which the mechanical properties can be either calculated using the long cylinder theory @xcite and/or simulated by using finite element analysis applications ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",

    ", we will briefly overview the history of @xmath0sr experiments performed under pressure , describe the design of the pressure cells used at psi and present the properties of the materials used to build the pressure cell and related accessories .",
    "the first @xmath0sr experiments under pressure at psi were performed in 1980 by butz _",
    "_ @xcite . a clamped cell with oil as pressure transmitting media ( maximum pressure , @xmath54  gpa ) was used for studying the transition metals fe and ni .",
    "as a next step , in 1986 a gas pressure cell was designed ( @xmath55  gpa , helium as pressure transmitting media ) @xcite .",
    "however , due to safety reasons , the maximum pressure available for these cells was limited to about 0.9  gpa .",
    "this type of pressure device was successfully used until 1999 for various studies @xcite .",
    "in addition to the limited pressure range , these cells had the disadvantage that the helium capillary imposed quite severe temperature range restrictions , with typical lowest temperatures slightly below 10  k. moreover , safety reasons imposed a release of the pressure when accessing the experimental area which caused unwanted pressure cycles .    at the beginning of 2001 , a new generation of psi pressure cells came into operation @xcite .",
    "the starting point was a close collaboration with the group of d.  jaccard from the university of geneva .",
    "a first development was a single layer piston cylinder cell , open solely at one end , using liquid as a pressure transmitting media and made of a copper beryllium ( cube ) alloy .",
    "the peculiar opening at only one end was adopted because of the restrictions imposed by the sample environment , _",
    "i.e. _ the distance between the center of the cryostat windows to the bottom of the sample space . this cell could reach @xmath56  gpa ( @xmath57  gpa ) for a 7  mm ( 5  mm ) inner diameter of the cell .",
    "a further step was accomplished with the use of mp35n ( ni - co - cr - mo ) alloy for the body of the pressure cell and pressures up to about 1.9 - 2.0  gpa could be routinely obtained .",
    "the latest developments are double layer cells made of a combination between cube and mp35n . to guarantee a @xmath0sr signal with a high enough signal to background ratio , the dimensions of the sample space are rather large limiting therefore the maximum pressure to 2.5  gpa ( 1.8  gpa ) for a sample space with a diameter of 6 mm for pressure cells opened from both sides made out of mp35n / mp35n ( or cube / cube , respectively ) .",
    "this type of cells will be presented in more details in section  [ sec : p - cell ] .",
    "it is fair to say that presently the bulk of @xmath0sr experiments under pressure , as well as of the further development of @xmath0sr pressure cells are performed at psi .",
    "this is due to the unique combination of high - pressures and sub - kelvin croygenics capabilities available at the gpd instrument .",
    "nevertheless , some activity takes place also at isis ( uk ) and at triumf ( canada ) . at isis",
    "the experiments are carried out using the high - momentum riken - ral beamline by using gas pressure cell with @xmath58  gpa @xcite . at triumf",
    "a single wall piston - cylnder type of pressure cell with maximum pressure @xmath59  gpa is used .",
    "the experiments are conducted at the m9b beam - line by using the dedicated ` omni - prime ' spectrometer .",
    "the cross - sectional view of a fully assembled typical double - wall pressure cell is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - cell ] .",
    "the main components of the cell are : ( i ) a cylindrical double - wall body , ( ii ) pistons , ( iii)mushroom  seals , ( iv ) locking nuts , and ( v ) spacers .",
    "the latest are needed to support the pistons and prevent their rotation when the nuts are tightened .",
    "diameters and heights of the outer and the inner cylinders are @xmath60  mm , @xmath61  mm , and @xmath62  mm , @xmath63  mm , respectively .",
    "two types of cells with inner diameter 6  mm and 7  mm were produced . with both pistons",
    "completely inserted , the maximum sample height is @xmath64  mm . the body of the cell , the top and the bottom locking nuts and the mushroom pieces are made of mp35n alloy ( ni  35% , co  35% ,",
    "cr20% , and mo10% in weight percent , see ref .",
    "all the pieces were heat - treated for 4 hours at 590  @xmath65c after machining .",
    "pistons and spacers are made of non - magnetic tungsten carbide ( ceratizit - ctf21r , see ref .",
    "the sealing rings were made of fully hardened copper beryllium alloy ( berilco-25 ) .",
    "the body of the pressure cell consists of two parts  the inner and the outer cylinders which are shrink fitted into each other .",
    "two alternative methods for the fabrication of the pressure cell were tried . in the first approach ,",
    "the inner cylinder was prepared with a diameter @xmath66  mm bigger than the inner diameter of the outer cylinder . by heating the outer cylinder up to @xmath67c and cooling down the inner one to liquid nitrogen temperature",
    "it is possible to fit them into each other . by coming back to ambient temperatures",
    "the inner cylinder remains under radial compression from the outer cylinder . in the other approach ,",
    "the outer surface of the inner and the inner surface of the outer cylinders were machined conically with the angle of @xmath68 .",
    "the diameter difference of both fully assembled cylinders is @xmath69  mm .",
    "the pressure cell is produced by mechanically inserting the inner cylinder into the outer one by using a hydraulic press .",
    "this process is similar to the situation of a cold / warm fitting of the cylinders as described above .",
    "the friction between the two parts is high enough to keep the cell fully assembled .",
    "note that pressure cells produced by both described ways were found to behave very similarly with respect to the the maximum reachable pressure , as well as with respect to the pressure loss caused by friction between the sealing system and the pressure cell walls .",
    "sr experiments .",
    "the calculations are made using the ansys r15.0 software . ]    in order to investigate the mechanical response of the cell to the applied pressure , a finite element analysis by using the ansys r15.0 software was performed @xcite using the appropriate boundary conditions and including a modeling of the force between two cylinders .",
    "figure  [ fig : ansys ] shows a sectional view of the body of the cell with the corresponding principal stress and the shear stress distributions .",
    "these calculations were made for ` extreme ' conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ when the stress at the border between two cylinders reaches the so - called ultimate tensile strength of the mp35n alloy ( 2.07  gpa , ref .",
    "the results reveal that the ` theoretical ' limit for a double - wall cell made of mp35n alloy is of the order of 3.9  gpa . for safety reasons ,",
    "the maximum applied pressure is always limited to 3.5  gpa .",
    "the applied pressure at closing time is calculated as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the force applied by the hydraulic press and @xmath72 is the surface area of the piston .",
    "note that @xmath73 is usually much larger than the effective real pressure inside the cell due to friction effects .    as will be shown later for @xmath74  k , the @xmath0sr response of a mp35n cell is strongly temperature dependent . therefore",
    ", at very low temperature , the cell signal may be difficult to separate from the one of the sample . for precise experiments",
    "we have also prepared a single wall pressure cells of a similar design ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - cell ] ) made of copper beryllium alloy . even though such a cell allows to reach a maximum pressure just half of the one accessible with a double wall mp35n cell ,",
    "the paramount advantage of it is a @xmath0sr response that is temperature independent at very low temperatures .",
    "the design of the seal is defined by two requirements .",
    "first , as shown in section  [ sec : musr_under_pressure ] , in @xmath0sr experiments under pressure the muons stop not only in the sample but also in the pressure cell walls . therefore , the muon asymmetry spectra described by eq .",
    "[ eq : asymmetry_pc ] consists of ` sample ' and ` pressure cell ' contributions and one should avoid the presence of any other material , except the sample , inside the pressure cell channel .",
    "a second requirement is to have the possibility to perform several pressure changes without opening the pressure cell .",
    "we approached the problem by implementing the seal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - cell]b .",
    "the seal assembly consists of a conically shaped sealing ring ( hardened copper beryllium ) , a mushroom - shaped piece ( mp35n alloy ) , a teflon ring and a rubber o - ring .",
    "the initial sealing is made by the o - ring allowing one to close the cell and to increase the pressure up to the level where the teflon ring starts to flow and to fill the gap between the mushroom and the pressure cell walls .",
    "the conical copper beryllium ring impedes that the teflon flows further which would cause a blocking of the piston .",
    "this design makes full use of the bore of the cell to accommodate the sample , and allows to perform repeated pressure changes in increasing or decreasing directions .",
    "the process of loading the cell is permanently monitored by using a specially designed computer - controlled system allowing to measure in - situ the displacement of the piston ( @xmath75 ) and the radial expansion of the pressure cell as a function of loading force @xmath71 .",
    "special attention is paid to maintain the pressure cell in the ` elastic ' regime , _",
    "i.e. _ by ensuring that the slope @xmath76 of the loading curve @xmath77 is almost constant",
    ". a sudden change of the slope @xmath76 would correspond either to a leakage of the cell or would signal that one exceeds the local stress level above the elastic regime . in both cases",
    "the loading process must be immediately stopped and the pressure in the cell released to zero .",
    "the exact pressure inside the cell is determined by monitoring the pressure - dependent shift of the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath78 ) of a small piece of indium ( pressure probe ) .",
    "the volume of the pressure probe is much lower than the one of the sample to avoid an additional background contribution to @xmath0sr signal .",
    "for the superconducting transition temperature of indium the following relation holds @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80  k is the transition temperature of in at ambient pressure .",
