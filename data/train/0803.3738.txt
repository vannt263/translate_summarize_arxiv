    "consider the 2d axial projection of a centrifugal forward fan ( @xcite ) .",
    "air is sucked from a central zone and channeled between two blades .",
    "then , centrifugal force put it towards the external zone of the fan . from the point of view of a single blade , air flow reaches its geometrical basis and go through the blades channel . in this work",
    "the fundamental hypothesis is that _ the flow field is tangent to the profile of a blade at its initial point_.    [ plotfig1 ]        it can be shown that this condition is suitable in the case of noise reduction .",
    "but what about the profile of the blade , in the case of geometrical or engineering bonds ?",
    "+    [ plotfig2 ]        let \\{@xmath0 } a cartesian system local to a blade , with @xmath1-axis containing the blade s initial geometrical point ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "assume that the blade s profile is the graphic of a smooth function @xmath2 .",
    "also we assume that _ the flow velocity field is tangent along the concave side _ , that is we neglect physical effects as boundary layer or flow separation ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the acceleration along the blade s side is the sum of the tangential and the centripetal accelerations , that is ( see @xcite )    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the local speed in the \\{@xmath0 } system , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the radius of curvature :    @xmath7    note that we consider @xmath8 if @xmath9 , negative otherwise .",
    "then the @xmath10-component of the total local acceleration is    @xmath11    now we try to write previous equation using only @xmath1 and its derivatives .",
    "first of all , as @xmath12 , by chain rule we have    @xmath13    @xmath14    so that    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    also , note that @xmath17 , so using usual trigonometric formulas we can write    @xmath18    with all these previous identities and the assumption @xmath19 , after some simplifications equation ( [ xlocalacc ] ) becomes    @xmath20    in the points of the blade where @xmath21 this equation is banally satisfied , so we can say that in the points where @xmath22 is not null the blade equation is    @xmath23    previous is a nonlinear differential equation that can be used in two manners : if one assigns the blade profile , that is the function @xmath24 , then by ( [ diffeq2 ] ) it can be computed the law motion @xmath25 along the blade side ; if one wants to assigne a particular motion @xmath26 , then it can compute the blade profiles @xmath24 which satisfy that law .",
    "suppose that engineering project or physical bonds require a particular law motion @xmath25 such that @xmath27",
    ". then @xmath28 .",
    "note that , for our geometrical assumptions , we have a boundary condition @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the cartesian coordinates of the blade s initial point .",
    "also , from physical assumptions about the tangential flow at blade s initial point , we have a bondary condition on the derivative : @xmath31 , being @xmath32 the slope of the flow field at impeller inlet .",
    "then the blade profile is determined by the differential problem"
