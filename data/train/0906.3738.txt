    "quantum entanglement @xcite describes a scenario where the quantum states of two objects separated in space are strongly correlated .",
    "these correlations can be exploited in emerging technologies such as quantum computing , should one be able to spatially separate the entangled objects without destroying the correlations . in a broader context , quantum entanglement could prove to be of practical importance in the fields of spintronics @xcite and information cryptography @xcite .",
    "it also holds a considerable interest from a purely fundamental physics point of view , prompting some of the more philosophically inclined discussions related to quantum theory and causality .",
    "superconductors have been proposed as natural sources for entangled electrons @xcite , as cooper pairs consist of two electrons that are both spin and momentum - entangled .",
    "the cooper pair can be spatially deformed by means of the crossed andreev reflection ( car ) process in superconducting heterostructures . in this scenario ,",
    "an electron and hole excitation are two separate metallic leads are coupled by means of andreev scattering processes at two spatially distinct interfaces .",
    "unfortunately , the signatures of car are often completely masked by a competing process known as elastic co - tunneling ( ct ) which occur in the same type of heterostructures .",
    "in fact , the conductances stemming from ct and car may cancel each other completely @xcite , thus necessitating the usage of noise - measurements to find fingerprints of the car process in such superconducting heterostructures .",
    "recently , graphene @xcite has been studied as a possible arena for car - processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown how a three - terminal graphene sheet containing @xmath0-doped , @xmath1-doped , and superconducting regions could be constructed to produce perfect car for one particular resonant bias voltage .",
    "also , the signatures of the car process in the noise - correlations of a similar device were studied in ref .",
    "however , the role played by the spin degree of freedom in graphene devices probing non - local transport has not been addressed so far .",
    "this is a crucial point since it might be possible to manipulate the spin - properties of the system to interact with the spin - singlet symmetry of the cooper pair in a fashion favoring car .    in this paper ,",
    "we show that precisely such an opportunity exists  it is possible to obtain a spin - switch effect between virtually perfect car and perfect ct in a superconducting graphene spin valve .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , this effect is seen for all bias voltages in the low - energy regime rather than just at one particular applied voltage difference .",
    "the key observation is that the possibility of tuning the local fermi - level to values equivalent to a weak , magnetic exchange splitting in graphene renders both the usual andreev reflection process and ct impossible .",
    "in contrast , this opportunity does not exist in conventional conductors where the fermi energy is large and of order @xmath2(ev ) .",
    "we show that graphene spin valves provide a possibility for a unique combination of non - local andreev reflection and spin - dependent klein tunneling @xcite . our model",

    "the incoming electron from the left ferromagnet may either be reflected normally or andreev - reflection ( ar ) . in the latter process ,",
    "it tunnels into the superconductor with another electron situated at @xmath32 , leaving behind a hole excitation with energy @xmath33 .",

    "we assume that the superconducting region is heavily doped , @xmath42 , which causes the propagating quasiparticles to travel along the @xmath43-axis since the scattering angle in the superconductor satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "we obtain the following wavefunction ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 while @xmath48 for subgap energies @xmath49 and @xmath50 for supergap energies @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to consider carefully the scattering angles in the problem .",
    "since we assume translational invariance in the @xmath52-direction , the @xmath52-component of the momentum is conserved .",
    "this gives us @xmath53 it is clear that the angle of transmission for the electrons in the right ferromagnet is equal to the angle of incidence when the magnetizations are p , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "also , one infers that there exists a critical angle above which the scattered waves become evanescent , i.e. decaying exponentially .",
    "this may be seen by observing that the scattering angles exceed @xmath55 ( thus becoming imaginary ) above a certain angle of incidence @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , the ar wave in the left ferromagnetic region becomes evanescent for angles of incidence @xmath57 , where the critical angle @xmath58 is obtained by setting @xmath59 in the equation @xmath60 expressing conservation of momentum perpendicular to the interface .",

    "a similar argument can be made for the transmitted electron wave - function in the right ferromagnetic region , corresponding to the ct process , where the critical angle for this process becomes @xmath63|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the p configuration , the ct process thus always contributes to the transport of charge .",
    "finally , the contribution to transport of charge from car comes from the hole - wave function in the right ferromagnetic region , which becomes evanescent for angles of incidence above the critical angle @xmath64|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the p configuration , this criteria is the same as the vanishing of local ar expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalar ] ) .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that the most interesting phenomena occur when the exchange field @xmath10 is comparable in magnitude to the chemical potential @xmath65 . if @xmath66 , the effect of the exchange field should be minor and the ar is never specular .",
    "in contrast , the situation becomes quite fascinating when we consider the case @xmath67 under the assumption of a doped situation @xmath68 .",
    "first of all , the incoming quasiparticles from the left ferromagnetic region are completely dominated by the majority spin carriers @xmath69 , since the density of states ( dos ) for @xmath70 electrons vanishes at the fermi level . since @xmath67 , the ar process is suppressed for all incoming waves as @xmath71 .",
    "we now show how the fate of the cross - conductance in the right ferromagnetic region depends crucially on whether the magnetization configuration is p or ap . in the p configuration , we see that @xmath72 , which means that the transport is purely governed by the ct process . in the ap configuration , we see that @xmath73 , which means that the transport is mediated purely by the car process .",
    "this suggests a remarkable spin - switch effect  by reversing the direction of the field in the right ferromagnet , one obtains an abrupt change from pure ct to pure car processes mediating the transport of charge . in each case",
    ", there is no local ar in the left ferromagnetic region . in the standard metallic case ,",
    "the distinct signatures for the ct and car contributions are masked by each other , and it becomes necessary to resort to noise - measurements in order to say something about the contribution from each process . in the present scenario ,",
    "we have showed how it is possible to separate the two contributions directly by a simple spin - switch effect which is commonly employed in experimental work on f@xmath14s heterostructures .",

    "[ fig : ap ] . in both cases ,",
    "the magnitude of the conductance varies strongly when considering different widths @xmath98 due to the fast oscillations which pertain to the formation of resonant transmission levels inside the superconductor .",
    "also , it is seen that while the ct process is favored for short junctions @xmath99 , the car process is suppressed in this regime in favor of normal reflection . upon increasing the junction width , the ct conductance drops while the car conductance peaks at widths @xmath100 .",
    "the remarkable aspect is that it is possible to switch between these two scenarios of exclusive ct and exclusive car simply by reversing the direction of magnetization in one of the ferromagnetic layers .",

    "it would be challenging to obtain a truly homogeneous chemical potential in a graphene sheet , and electron - hole puddles appear to be an intrinsic feature of graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been speculated that such charge inhomogeneities may play an important role with regard to limiting the transport characteristics of graphene @xcite near the dirac points .",
    "however , for our purposes this is actually beneficial ",
    "it is precisely the suppression of charge and spin transport at fermi level for the andreev reflection and co - tunneling process which renders possible the spin - switch effect .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the inclusion of charge inhomogeneities should alter our results qualitatively .",
    "finally , we note that since the spin of the charge - carriers in each of the non - superconducting graphene sheets are practically speaking fixed due to the vanishing dos for minority spins , the spin - switch effect for car and ec predicted in this paper can not be directly related to entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , it constitutes a clear non - local signal for quantum transport which can be probed experimentally , and should be helpful in identifying clear - signatures of the mesoscopic car phenomenon .",

    "we have shown how one may create a spin - switch effect between perfect elastic co - tunneling and perfect crossed andreev - reflection for all applied bias voltages by reversing the magnetization direction in one of the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "the basic mechanism behind this effect is that the local fermi - level in graphene may be tuned so that the fermi surface for minority spins reduces to a single point in the presence of a weak , magnetic exchange splitting .",
    "this is very distinct from the equivalent spin valve structures in conventional metallic systems , where noise - measurements are required to clearly distinguish between these processes .",
