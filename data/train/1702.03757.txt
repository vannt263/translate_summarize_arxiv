    "the presence of additional terms in the qcd green s functions , beyond those generated by ope ( understood as perturbation theory and power corrections ) , is a generally accepted fact , with support both from theory and phenomenology . according to the standard terminology @xcite ,",
    "these terms are said to violate quark - hadron duality .",
    "we recall that , in its conventional sense , quark - hadron duality assumes that the description in terms of the ope , valid on the euclidian axis and at complex energies , can be analytically continued to match with the description in terms of hadrons , which live on the minkowski axis .",
    "dvs are supposed to arise from contributions of internal lines with soft momenta in the feynman diagrams , which are not included in the ope .",
    "their calculation from first principles is , at least at present , impossible .",
    "quantitative understanding must be based on realistic models , whose main features have been tested against experimental data .",
    "two types of specific mechanisms have been suggested , one considering quarks in an instanton field @xcite , the other based on narrow - resonance saturation in the large-@xmath3 limit @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms are materialized in exponentially suppressed terms on the spacelike axis , which exhibit oscillations when analytically continued to the timelike axis .",
    "more formal arguments in favour of the existence of dvs are provided by ideas of resurgence and the associated trans - series @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the ope , expected to be a divergent expansion with increasing large - order coefficients , is actually an asymptotic series , leads also naturally to the presence of additional exponentially suppressed contributions @xcite .",
    "however , beyond these somewhat general arguments , no detailed dynamical calculation of the additional contributions present in the theoretical expression of the green s functions is available .",
    "the phenomenological extraction of dvs is far from trivial because one must detect terms exponentially suppressed as function of energy , while an infinity of terms logarithmically and power suppressed , _",
    "i.e. _ larger in principle , are neglected in the standard truncated expansions of the green functions .",
    "since these expansions are actually divergent , the magnitude of the neglected terms can be quite substantial .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , the confrontation between theory and experiments implies an analytic continuation in the complex energy plane , with its known instabilities and pitfalls .",
    "analyticity is usually exploited by means of a cauchy integral relation along a contour in the complex plane for the qcd polarization amplitude of interest multiplied by a suitable weight .",
    "this allows one to build sum - rules that relate the integrated theoretical predictions on the contour to weighted integrals over the spectral function data on the positive minkowski axis .",
    "the weight is chosen such as to enhance or to suppress the contribution of various terms in the theoretical expression of the amplitude .",
    "the impact of dvs for practical calculations is therefore sensitive to the weights that are employed and vary depending on the quantity of interest . when extracting qcd parameters , for example , different weight functions have been advocated . in some works ,",
    "dvs are explicitly taken into account by means of realistic parametrizations  @xcite , which allows for a quantitative control of their contribution , while in others dvs are ignored on the basis of their suppression by the weight functions employed   @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the different approaches is still being questioned  @xcite and , therefore , a better understanding of dvs would certainly contribute to the precision with which qcd parameters can be extracted .",
    "this is particularly true for the determination of the coupling @xmath4 from the @xmath2-hadronic spectral functions .    in the recent paper @xcite ,",
    "a method based on functional analysis was proposed in order to test the presence of dvs in qcd .",
    "the method starts from the obvious remark that the  true \" polarization amplitude and its approximate theoretical expression are entirely different functions , with different analytic properties , which can not coincide in the complex energy plane .",
    "moreover , defining a functional distance , measured in a certain norm , between these two functions along a contour in the complex plane , a rigorous nonzero lower bound on this distance can be shown to exist .",
    "in particular , for the functional distances defined in @xmath1 and in @xmath0 norms , the lower bound can be calculated by an explicit algorithm involving the qcd approximant in the complex plane and an infinity of fourier coefficients obtained from the spectral function (  moments \" ) measured experimentally on a part of the timelike axis .    as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the minimal distance between the true function and its approximant can be used as a tool for detecting the presence of dvs . in particular , from the variation of the minimal distance with respect to a parameter @xmath5 that measures the strength of the duality violating contribution , one can infer the optimal value of this parameter .",
    "formulated in this way , the problem becomes analogous to the search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in experiments at very high energies , where one tests for the presence of new physics through a `` strength parameter '' @xmath5 of the signal , while treating sm as a background .",
    "in our case , the `` new physics '' is represented by dv terms , while ope is the background representing the `` known physics '' .    the application of these ideas to a toy model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that the new approach might be useful for detecting the presence of dvs in qcd .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the exact model contains , besides a purely perturbative term and an expansion identified with higher - dimension terms in the ope , an additional term that can be interpreted as a dv contribution . the minimal functional distance defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculated with the spectral function of the model and a truncated ope to mimic the physical cases , displayed a sharp minimum at the true value of the strength @xmath5 of the dv term .",
    "in particular , the functional distance measured in @xmath1 norm proved to be more sensitive to the variation of the parameter @xmath5 than the distance measured in @xmath0 norm .",
    "however , the effect of the experimental uncertainties inherent in the spectral function used as input was only barely touched in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of this aspect is crucial for assessing the usefulness of the method to detect dvs from real data . in the present paper",
    "we address precisely this problem .",
    "we consider the same toy model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming now that the spectral function is measured only in a finite number of bins with uncertainties and correlations similar to those reported in real experiments on hadronic @xmath2 decays .",
    "it turns out that a statistical interpretation of the minimal distances defined by functional analysis is difficult to assess theoretically .",
    "therefore , we perform an empirical study based on pseudodata , where fake data on the spectral function are generated in a number of bins , with a multivariate gaussian distributions with covariances inferred from the aleph covariance matrix for the vector ( @xmath6 ) channel  @xcite .",
    "the statistical distribution of the parameter @xmath5 that measures the magnitude of the dv term added to the usual ope is then derived by monte carlo simulations , allowing the extraction of a mean and a standard deviation .",
    "the aim is to establish if the method is able to detect , in a statistically significant way , the presence of dvs from error - affected experimental measurements .",
    "we also compare the procedures based on @xmath1 and @xmath0 norms and establish which is the most eficient tool when the uncertainties in the spectral function are taken into account . in the process , we give closed analytical expressions for the functional distances in a generalized weighted @xmath0 norm that interpolates almost exactly between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start , in sec .  2 , with a brief review of the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , defining the minimal functional distances in @xmath1 and @xmath0 norms and presenting the algorithms for their calculation .",
    "[ sec : math ] contains two new mathematical developments important for applications : in subsection  [ sec : approx ] we prove that the minimal distance based on the general weighted @xmath0 norm can be written down in a closed analytic form , and in subsection  [ sec : approx ] we derive a suitable approximation of the minimal distance based on @xmath1 norm by a class of weighted @xmath0 norms . in sec .",

    "having in view the importance of detecting and describing dvs in a reliable way , this framework , although somewhat limited , is of interest as a complementary approach to other phenomenological studies .",
