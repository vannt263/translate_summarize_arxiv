    "fingerprints of this new magnetic state have been observed in thin films of fege by lorentz transmission - electron microscopy@xcite and in bulk samples by small - angle neutron scattering@xcite as a characteristic distribution of the lateral magnetization and a hexagonal bragg - spot pattern , respectively .",
    "the occurrence of a skyrmion phase and the helical magnetism in zero field are the consequence of the dzyaloshinskii - moryia interaction ( dm ) .",

    "the investigation of the critical behavior of fege and related cubic helimagnets is of prime interest as it yields important microscopic information about the underlying magnetic interactions .",
    "several studies were devoted to determine the critical exponents of some chiral cubic magnets",
    ". nonetheless , the reported values and universality classes across these compounds are controversial and contradictory . based on isothermal magnetization data",

    "however , a study on fe@xmath10co@xmath11si using isothermal magnetization and magneto - transport reported a consistent set of critical exponents that fall in the 3d - heisenberg universality class@xcite .",
    "results of a scaling analysis based on temperature - dependent ac - susceptibility data on cu@xmath12oseo@xmath13 led to the conclusion that this insulating chiral magnet also belongs to the 3d - heisenberg universality class@xcite .",
    "in particular the inconsistent findings reported for fege@xcite are puzzling as it can be regarded as a strong band - ferromagnet with a stable magnetic moment ( @xmath14 ) , a relatively high ordering temperature , and negligible spin fluctuations@xcite . in this respect fege",
    "is similar to a classical band - ferromagnet ( fm ) , like ni@xcite , but with the peculiarity that the transition from the pm phase to helical ordering is obscured by the ics state .",
    "therefore , a consistent scaling analysis of the critical behavior should be performed in fields strong enough to overcome the dm interaction and to exclude any influence of the helical , conical , and skyrmion states .",

    "however , in contrast to this , mnsi has been argued to exhibit tri - critical mean - field behavior@xcite .",
    "thus , the question arises why mnsi should be so different from the other cubic helimagnets despite the same underlying magnetic interactions .",
    "unfortunately , this question can not be unambiguously answered as no scaling study has been made in the appropriate regime for mnsi so far .",
    "as pointed out above , a scaling analysis can only provide a meaningful answer if it is done in the critical region ( @xmath99 ) and on the unperturbed magnetic system , i.e. for fields well above @xmath7 .",
    "these requirements are obviously quite challenging for mnsi , given its low @xmath5 and relatively high @xmath7 values , and were not fulfilled in the reported scaling studies@xcite .",
    "moreover , the spin polarization of the weak itinerant band - ferromagnet mnsi@xcite is strongly affected by the longitudinal spin - fluctuations in contrast to the _ stable _ spin - polarization of fe in the strong band - ferromagnet fege@xcite .",
    "this effect is seen in a very large high - field susceptibility in mnsi which further complicates the scaling analysis .",

    "according to the difference in the masses , the energies below 24 mev are dominated by ge modes , while fe modes dominate at higher frequencies .    adding the experimentally determined electronic specific heat to the calculated phonon contribution yielded the non - magnetic contribution to @xmath104 shown as solid line in fig .",
