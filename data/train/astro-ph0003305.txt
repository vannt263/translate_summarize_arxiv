    "magnetic reconnection is of great interest in many space and laboratory plasmas @xcite , and has been studied extensively for more than four decades .",
    "the most important question is that of the reconnection rate .",
    "the process of magnetic reconnection , is so complex , however , that this question is still not completely resolved , even within the simplest possible _ canonical _ model : two - dimensional ( 2d ) incompressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) with uniform resistivity @xmath0 in the limit of @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the global lundquist number , @xmath3 being the half - length of the reconnection layer ) .",
    "historically , there were two drastically different estimates for the reconnection rate : the sweet ",
    "parker model @xcite gave a rather slow reconnection rate ( @xmath4 ) , while the petschek @xcite model gave any reconnection rate in the range from @xmath5 up to the fast maximum petschek rate @xmath6 .",
    "up until the present it was still unclear whether petschek - like reconnection faster than sweet ",
    "parker reconnection is possible .",
    "biskamp s simulations @xcite are very persuasive that , in resistive mhd , the rate is generally that of sweet  parker .",
    "still , his simulations are for @xmath7 in the range of a few thousand , and his boundary conditions are somewhat tailored to the reconnection rate he desires , the strength of the field and the length of layer adjusting to yield the sweet  parker rate .",
    "thus , a more systematic boundary layer analysis is desirable to really settle the question . in particular",
    ", one needs an elaborate and detailed picture of the reconnection current layer  namely , a picture that features a realistic model for the variation of the outside magnetic field along the layer , and realistic 2d profiles of the plasma parameters inside the layer .",
    "the development of such a framework is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "we believe that the methods developed in this paper are rather universal and can be applied to a very broad class of reconnecting systems that include more realistic physics .",
    "however , for definiteness and clarity we keep in mind a particular global geometry , that presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - global ] ( although we do not use it explicitly in our present analysis ) .",
    "this figure shows the situation somewhere in the middle of the process of merging of two plasma cylinders .",
    "regions  i and ii are ideal mhd regions : regions  i represent unreconnected flux , and region  ii represents reconnected flux .",
    "the two regions  i are separated by the very narrow _ reconnection current layer_. plasma from regions  i enters the reconnection layer and gets accelerated along the layer , finally entering the _ separatrix region _ , also between regions  i and ii .",
    "in general , both the reconnection layer and the separatrix region require resistive treatment .",
    "the plasma entering the separatrix from the reconnection layer is traveling at nearly the alfvn speed .",
    "it crashes into the plasma at rest on the separatrix lines , that has not passed through the reconnection layer , but which got there by direct @xmath8 motion across the lines as the position of the separatrix changed by reconnection .",
    "this crash generates considerable heat , and hence back pressure on the reconnection layer .",
    "however , the separatrix region is continually in transition since different plasma occupies it as the reconnection proceeds so that the heated plasma is moved into the reconnected region .",
    "thus , the plasma encountered by the outflowing reconnected plasma is continually refreshed and can always be taken initially at rest . therefore , there is a time delay before the back reaction sets in . in our paper",
    ", we attempt to model this dynamical behavior of the separatrix plasma as accurately as possible .",
    "[ tbp ]    in the limit @xmath1 the reconnection rate is slow compared with the alfvn time @xmath9 , which allows one to break the whole problem into the global problem and the local problem . in a previous paper ref .",
    "@xcite , we argued that on the _ global scale _",
    "( i.e. , on the scale of order the half - length of the layer  @xmath3 ) the time evolution of the reconnecting system can be described as a sequence of magnetostatic equilibria . in paper",
    "@xcite we explained that the role of the global solution is to give the general geometry of the reconnecting system , the position and the length of the reconnection layer and of the separatrix , and the boundary conditions for the local problem ( which , in turn , determines the reconnection rate ) .",
    "these boundary conditions are expressed in terms of the outside magnetic field  @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the direction along the layer . in particular",
    ", @xmath10 provides the characteristic global scales : the half - length of the layer  @xmath3 , defined as the point where @xmath10 has minimum , and the global alfvn speed , defined as @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to understand that the global solution is essentially independent of the local reconnection physics .    in this paper",
    "we study the local problem concerning the reconnection layer itself .",
    "our main goal here is to determine the internal structure of a steady state reconnection current layer ( i.e. , to find the 2d  profiles of plasma velocity and magnetic field ) , and the reconnection rate represented by the ( uniform ) electric field  @xmath13 .",
    "our most important result is that , in the case of uniform resistivity , there is a unique stable steady - state solution , and this is essentially the sweet",
    " parker solution .",
    "we show that petschek s solution ( which is not unique and supposedly encompasses a variety of reconnection solutions from that of sweet and parker to a solution reconnecting at almost the alfvn speed ) actually relaxes to the single sweet - parker solution .",
    "first , in section  [ sec - model ] we discuss the assumptions of our physical model of the layer in some detail .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - rescaled ] we introduce the rescaled equations representing the mathematical model of our problem . in section  [ sec - simulations ]",
    "we present our numerical simulations . and",
    ", finally , in section  [ sec - conclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "by the local problem we mean the analysis of the _ internal structure _ of the reconnection layer and the separatrix layer , which is necessary for the determination of the reconnection rate . since in ideal mhd",
    "these layers are current sheets of zero thickness , resolving their inner structure can not be done in this ideal framework and requires the addition of some new nonideal physics .    historically , most important , and conceptually most interesting for the purpose of resolving the current layer , is the inclusion of small resistivity .",
    "the model in which the only nonideal effect is that of the resistivity appears to be the simplest model with the minimal required complexity needed to resolve the current density singularity of an ideal mhd solution .",
    "thus , in this analysis we _ assume _ that the only new nonideal physical process is small constant and uniform resistivity @xmath0 ( and perhaps viscosity  @xmath14 ; see discussion below ) .",
    "the inclusion of the small resistivity means the introduction of a new dimensionless small parameter associated with it , namely the inverse lundquist number @xmath15 , which is considered the _ primary small parameter _ of the problem .",
    "this means that we are interested in studying the case of @xmath1 , and we want to determine how the parameters of the layer , such as its thickness and the reconnection rate , scale with @xmath7 in the leading order .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , making use of this small parameter helps to simplify the problem significantly while keeping all essential features , such as the two - dimensional nature of the problem , intact .    the next assumption we make concerns a steady state .",
    "the _ steady - state _ condition means that parameters of the current layer as well as the boundary conditions change very slowly compared with the global alfvn time , which is the characteristic time spent by a fluid element inside the reconnection layer . a very important consequence of the steady - state condition in 2d geometry is that , due to the maxwell equation @xmath16 , the @xmath17  component of the electric field is uniform : @xmath18 .",
    "as for the plasma viscosity , it does not seem to be necessary to include it , because viscosity , unlike resistivity , does not play any role in the actual breaking the lines of force .",
    "however , we always include a small constant and uniform viscosity  @xmath14 for two reasons .",
    "first , in our numerical simulations we include it for numerical stability .",
    "the second and more important reason is that the consideration of very small ( even compared with the resistivity ) viscosity is useful to correctly understand some important features of the magnetic field configuration at the very center of the current layer ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    next",
    ", most of the classical models of reconnection , including both sweet  parker and petschek , assume that the outside merging magnetic field is uniform .",
    "but this assumption actually prohibits one from formulating the problem in a mathematically complete and consistent manner , because the downstream boundary conditions for the flow can not be correctly specified . in this quasi - one - dimensional framework",
    ", there is no natural end of the layer ; in particular , there is no way to define the global scale  @xmath3 . this , in turn , makes all attempts to get some scalings for the reconnection rate with the lundquist number essentially meaningless , since the definition of the lundquist number involves  @xmath3 .",
    "now , in our paper a generic and more or less representative variation of the outside magnetic field @xmath10 along the layer and along the separatrix [ where it is called @xmath19 is included as an integral part of the problem . in particular , the global scale ( the half - width @xmath3 of the layer )",
    "is defined naturally as the distance along the midplane from the center of the current layer to one of the two endpoints  i.e. , the points where the outside magnetic field goes through a minimum and where the separatrices branch off the midplane @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , this global scale is the characteristic scale for the function @xmath10 . since this function",
    "is determined by the global ideal mhd solution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the scale  @xmath3 is , by definition , independent of the physics of the resistive layer .    thus , the nonuniformity of the outside magnetic field along the layer makes the problem essentially _ two - dimensional _ ( rather than one - dimensional ) .",
    "one practically important consequence of this fact is that the problem becomes much more complicated mathematically , so that one has to abandon any hope for a nice analytical solution and to resort to numerical simulation instead .",
    "thus , the physical model of the reconnection layer that we are going to use in this paper for treating the local problem , can be summarized as    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ two - dimensional , steady - state , incompressible , resistive mhd with constant and uniform resistivity ( and perhaps viscosity ) in the limit of very large lundquist number .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    perfect mirror symmetry is assumed with respect to both the @xmath21  axis and the @xmath11  axis . and @xmath22 are even and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are odd with respect to @xmath20 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are even and @xmath25 and @xmath22 are odd with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 along @xmath20 and @xmath28 along @xmath26 , which means that the two axes of symmetry are stream lines . ]",
    "we call this model the _ canonical reconnection layer model_.    when considering the local problem in this model , we use the global scale in the @xmath11  direction ( along the layer ) , and the local scale in the @xmath21  direction ( across the layer ) .",
    "the outside magnetic field @xmath10 determined by the global solution here plays the role of a boundary condition at @xmath29 .",
    "finally , although in this section we talked only about the reconnection layer itself , the same physical model applies also to the separatrix layer .",
    "in accordance with our physical mode , we can now write down the set of two - dimensional steady - state fluid equations for our system . these equations are :    \\(i ) the incompressibility condition : @xmath30    \\(ii ) the @xmath17  component of ohm s law : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "\\(iii ) the equation of motion ( with the viscosity ) : @xmath33 + \\nu \\nabla^2   { \\bf v } ,                                      \\eqno{(3)}\\ ] ] where the density is set to one .",
    "now we take the crucial step in our analysis .",
    "we note that the reconnection problem is fundamentally a boundary layer problem , with @xmath34 being the small parameter .",
    "this allows us to simplify our mhd equations by performing a _ rescaling procedure_@xcite inside the reconnection layer , to make rescaled resistivity equal to unity .",
    "this can be done in a natural way if one rescales the distances and the fields in the @xmath11  direction to the corresponding _ global _ values ( i.e. , the length of the layer  @xmath3 , the outside magnetic field just above the center of the layer @xmath35 , and the corresponding alfvn speed @xmath36 ) , while rescaling the distances in the @xmath21  direction and the @xmath21  components of the velocity and magnetic field to the corresponding _ local _ values : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the sweet",
    " parker thickness of the current layer .",
    "thus , one can see that the small scale  @xmath42 emerges naturally as the thickness of the resistive boundary layer .    the viscosity @xmath14 is now rescaled as @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that it is at least as small as the resistivity [ which means @xmath44 or less ] , and most of the time ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we will be interested in the case of vanishing viscosity @xmath45 ( which means @xmath46 ) .",
    "now , all of the rescaled dimensionless quantities ( @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 ) are generally of order  1 . using the small parameter @xmath47",
    ", one can simplify the equations by writing them down in the leading nontrivial order in @xmath48 .",
    "this way one neglects all unimportant corrections , keeping only the essential terms .",
    "first , the incompressibility condition is written in rescaled quantities in exactly the same way as in the unrescaled quantities : @xmath49    the @xmath17  component of the steady - state ohm s law can be written as @xmath50 where the first term on the rhs is the resistive term .",
    "next , consider the equation of motion .",
    "since all the velocities in the @xmath21  direction are small compared with the alfvn speed , the inertial terms in the @xmath21  component of the equation of motion  ( 3 ) are small , and this equation just gives one the pressure balance across the current sheet : @xmath51 which allows one to determine the pressure @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 once the pressure and the magnetic field @xmath10 outside the reconnection layer are known .",
    "it is customary to set the pressure outside the layer to zero , so that @xmath54 ( of course , one can add a large constant to the pressure to enforce incompressibility . since this constant cancels out of all our equations , we ignore it . )    finally , one has the @xmath11  component of the equation of motion , with acceleration provided both by the pressure gradient force , and by magnetic forces , and with the viscous force : @xmath55    it is interesting to note that almost everywhere in the layer the magnetic force @xmath56 is actually just the @xmath11  component of the magnetic pressure gradient force @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the unit vector along @xmath59 .",
    "the magnetic tension force @xmath60 is higher order everywhere except very close to the midplane ( in a thin region where the unrescaled fields satisfy @xmath61 ) .",
    "we believe that this rescaling procedure captures all the important dynamical features of the reconnection process .",
    "in order to find the steady - state solution for the system , we designed a time dependent resistive mhd code for the main reconnection layer .",
    "this main code was supplemented by another code describing the separatrix , which is needed to provide the nearly correct downstream boundary conditions for the main code .    in section  [ subsec - scheme ]",
    "we describe the main code for the reconnection layer together with the boundary conditions . in section  [ subsec - initial ]",
    "we discuss the different choices for the initial conditions used in the simulation . in section  [ subsec - separatrix ]",
    "we present the model for the separatrix region that we have used in order to get the downstream boundary conditions for the main layer . in section  [ subsec - results ]",
    "we report the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in order to approach the steady - state solution described by the system of rescaled equations  ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 )",
    ", we followed the true time evolution of the system , starting with some initial conditions that will be described in section  [ subsec - initial ] .",
    "the time evolution is described by the following two dynamic equations for the two dynamic variables @xmath62 and @xmath25 : @xmath63 and @xmath64 +   \\nabla \\cdot ( { \\bf b } b_y ) +   \\nu { { \\partial^2 v_y}\\over{\\partial x^2 } } +   \\left ( \\nu_y { { \\partial^2 v_y}\\over{\\partial y^2 } } \\right ) .",
    "\\eqno{(11)}\\ ] ] these equations are written ( using @xmath65 ) in conservative form ( i.e. , in the form of conservation laws ) , which is preferable for numerical computations .",
    "small artificial resistivity @xmath66 and viscosity @xmath67 , acting in the @xmath11  direction , are added to provide numerical stability . because they are small",
    ", these terms do not change the solution noticeably , as was verified in the runs .",
    "the natural unit of time in our simulations is the global alfvn time @xmath68 .",
    "once @xmath25 and @xmath62 are known everywhere at a new time step , one can find all other variables .",
    "namely , @xmath22 and @xmath24 are given by the derivatives of @xmath62 : @xmath69 and @xmath23 is obtained from the incompressibility condition by integrating @xmath70 in the @xmath21  direction starting from the midplane , where @xmath27 because of the symmetry : @xmath71    we used the finite - difference method with centered derivatives ( providing second order accuracy ) in both the @xmath21 and the @xmath11  directions .",
    "the time derivatives were one - sided .",
    "our scheme was explicit in the @xmath11  direction , but in the @xmath21  direction the resistive term in ohm s law ( @xmath72 ) was treated implicitly , while all other terms were treated explicitly .",
    "this enabled us to speed up the computations .",
    "we conducted the simulations on a rectangular grid ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "because of the symmetry , we considered only one quadrant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - comp - box ] ) .    [ t ]    now let us discuss the boundary conditions .",
    "there are four boundaries in the system : the upstream ( or upper ) boundary @xmath74 , @xmath75 , the downstream ( or right ) boundary @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and the two boundaries formed by the axes of symmetry : the lower boundary @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and the left boundary @xmath26 , @xmath77 .",
    "the flow enters through the upper boundary and leaves through the right boundary , so that there is no flow of plasma through the left and the lower boundaries . while the boundary conditions at the left and the lower boundaries come from simple symmetry conditions , the boundary conditions on the upper boundary and especially on the right boundary are more complicated , as we shall discuss below .    on the upper boundary ,",
    "the boundary conditions come from matching with the ideal mhd solution in region  i above the reconnection layer . in rescaled quantities ,",
    "this matching should be done at @xmath80 .",
    "but since in a numerical simulation it is not possible to place a boundary of the computation box at infinity , we place it at some sufficiently large @xmath81 .",
    "the typical values of @xmath82 in our simulations were @xmath83 .    from the ideal solution in region  i we know that , as @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( meaning @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 , which is prescribed .",
    "it turns out that , since the upper boundary is placed not at infinity but at some finite ( although large ) @xmath82 , it is better , for numerical reasons , to choose @xmath88 instead of @xmath89 .    as for the magnetic field",
    ", we just set @xmath90 .",
    "the function @xmath10 depends on the external boundary and the thermodynamics of the global solution as well as the amount of reconnected flux . rather than make use of a specific global solution we choose a generic one since the physics in the reconnection layer should be the same .",
    "however , near @xmath91 ( the end of the reconnection layer which terminates in a cusp geometry we must employ the square - root behavior derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , which any global solution must have .",
    "thus , in our numerical simulations we typically took @xmath92 consistent with the cusp solution ( see ref .",
    "the value @xmath93 of the outside magnetic field @xmath94 at the endpoint @xmath95 typically was taken to be @xmath96 or @xmath97 [ the magnetic field is normalized so that @xmath98 .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions worked well in our simulations .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the solution near the upper boundary was smooth , and the solution deep inside the reconnection layer did not depend on the exact position of the upper boundary .    at the lower boundary @xmath20 ,",
    "the boundary conditions come naturally from the requirement that both @xmath25 and @xmath62 be symmetric with respect to the midplane .",
    "thus , @xmath99 and also @xmath100 .    here",
    ", however , we would like to make one remark .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath101 at @xmath20 is needed only when one includes the viscous term @xmath102 in the equation of motion .",
    "if one does not keep this term , then this equation contains only first derivatives of @xmath25 in the @xmath21  direction , so one needs only one condition , which can be set at the upper boundary . in our simulations",
    ", however , we always include viscosity ( usually small , but not zero ) , both for numerical reasons and in order to resolve the behavior near the midplane ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the left boundary are similar to those on the lower boundary .",
    "they follow from symmetry and are rather straightforward : @xmath103    now consider the right ( or downstream ) boundary .",
    "we chose it at some point @xmath104 close to the endpoint ( typically @xmath105 ) .",
    "then , one needs to specify the downstream boundary conditions on this boundary .",
    "this boundary is , in fact , the interface between the main layer and the endpoint region and the separatrix .",
    "the boundary conditions should describe the effect of the separatrix reacting back on the main layer , in particular the back pressure .",
    "we are not aware of any previous numerical or theoretical studies in which the role of the back pressure has been adequately investigated .",
    "the problem of how to set the boundary conditions on this boundary is rather nontrivial and its discussion is postponed until section  [ subsec - separatrix ] .    to summarize ,",
    "the advantages of our approach to numerical simulation of the reconnection layer are the following :    \\1 ) first , the use of rescaled equations takes us directly into the realm of @xmath106 .",
    "\\2 ) second , this is an essentially 2d ( rather than 1d ) code that uses a realistic variation of the outside magnetic field along the layer .",
    "the position of the endpoint is clearly defined in terms of the function @xmath10 .",
    "we do not assume @xmath107 as many people do .",
    "\\3 ) we obtain the steady - state solution by following the true time evolution , and the rescaled equations are such that we do not give the boundary conditions for the incoming flow velocity at the upstream boundary .",
    "this is because the physical @xmath23 is small and its evolution is not determined from a dynamic equation of motion .",
    "instead , the equation of motion in the @xmath21  direction simply degenerates into the vertical pressure balance , and @xmath23 is determined from the incompressibility condition .",
    "thus , we do not specify @xmath108 as a boundary condition , which means that _ we do not prescribe the reconnection rate _ !",
    "the system itself determines what the reconnection rate should be !",
    "this is really a very important point .",
    "the fact that we rescaled the @xmath21  coordinate using the sweet ",
    "parker scaling does not actually mean that we prescribe the sweet ",
    "parker reconnection rate .",
    "if the system wants to go at a faster rate , then it would try to develop some new characteristic structures , extending beyond @xmath82 , and we should be able to see it .",
    "we have performed several runs with different initial conditions consistent with our boundary conditions .    in some cases we started with a configuration qualitatively resembling the sweet ",
    "parker reconnection layer ( see figs .",
    "[ fig - local - init - psi - cont - sp1 ] and [ fig - local - init - j - x - sp1 ] ) .",
    "these initial conditions can be written in the following analytical form :    @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 where we took the outside magnetic field @xmath10 in the form  ( 14 ) , and the variation of the magnetic flux on the midplane as @xmath112    the initial velocity was taken in the form @xmath113 and @xmath114 where the initial outside electric field @xmath115 varied but typically was of order one .",

    "( it should be observed that petschek , in his original paper , did not specify a unique reconnection rate .",
    "instead his reconnection rate depended on the length of the dissipation region @xmath116 , and his reconnection velocity was @xmath117 .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath118 gives the sweet - parker rate .",
    "the usually quoted petschek reconnection velocity , @xmath119 , was obtained by him when he took the minimum possible value for @xmath116 that would not seriously perturb the global solution .",

    "however , the solution in the bulk of the main layer strongly depends on the position of both the upstream and downstream boundaries , which is physically not acceptable . ] instead , they require matching with the solution in the separatrix region , which itself is just as complicated as the main layer . therefore , we have developed a supplemental numerical procedure for the separatrix region .",
    "to make the situation more tractable , we have adopted _ simplified physical model for the separatrix _ ",
    "namely , a model in which the resistive and the viscous terms are omitted , and hence the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma .",
    "even though this model does not describe the separatrix completely accurately , it should give one a qualitatively correct picture of the influence of the separatrix region back on the main layer , and thus sufficiently reasonable downstream boundary conditions for the main layer .",
    "in particular , our model includes the effects of the back pressure that the separatrix exerts on the main layer .",
    "we follow one given field line as it moves across the separatrix of length  @xmath134 as described in the introduction .",
    "this field line is described in terms of two functions : the magnetic field @xmath135 , and the parallel velocity @xmath136 . here",
    "@xmath137 is the length measured along the field line , starting from the boundary between the separatrix and the main layer ( @xmath138 or @xmath76 ) , and ending at the reflection point  a at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig - global ] ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "now , the time evolution in this one - dimensional problem corresponds to the perpendicular motion of the field line through the separatrix region . the new time variable  @xmath140 represents the relative position of the field line in real 2d space with respect to other field lines , and there is a one - to - one correspondence between the time  @xmath140 and the @xmath21  position of the footpoint ( the point where the field line intersects the boundary @xmath76 ) of this field line .",
    "this correspondence between @xmath140 and  @xmath21 is given by the @xmath21  component of the velocity of the field line , @xmath141 ( @xmath21 decreases as @xmath140 increases ) , and by the initial condition that @xmath74 at @xmath121 .",
    "we stop the simulation of the separatrix at the moment @xmath140 when @xmath142 becomes zero  i.e. , when the midplane is reached .",
    "a substantial advantage of this model is that one actually does not need to know where the field line is in real 2d space !",
    "the only thing one does need to know about the position of the field line in order to set up the downstream boundary conditions for the main layer is where it connects to the main layer  i.e. , what is the value of the coordinate @xmath21 at the point where the field line intersects the downstream boundary @xmath76 ( i.e. , the footpoint ) .",
    "the boundary conditions on the upper boundary of the separatrix are @xmath143 and @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the field outside the separatrix in the upstream region given by the global ideal mhd solution , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our simulation",
    "we took this outside field in the form @xmath146    now these conditions become the _ initial _ conditions at @xmath121 for our 1d ( plus time ) problem concerning this one field line .",
    "as in the main layer , we use here an explicit ( in @xmath137 ) code with centered differences for convective derivatives in the @xmath137  direction .",
    "the boundary conditions at the right boundary @xmath139 ( the reflection point  a on fig .",
    "[ fig - global ] ) come from the condition of symmetry with respect to this point ( @xmath139 ) : @xmath147    the other pair of boundary conditions is given at the left ( incoming ) boundary @xmath138 and is provided by the main layer in terms of the values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 . assuming that the steady state in the main layer has already been achieved , these boundary conditions are constant in time in the laboratory frame , but in the frame moving along together with the field line , they are now time - dependent .    since at the boundary @xmath76 the layer is still essentially straight , and the field lines ( except those few very close to the midplane , which are ignored ) are also almost straight",
    ", then the absolute value of the magnetic field @xmath150 is almost exactly equal to  @xmath24 and the parallel velocity @xmath151 is almost exactly equal to  @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the matching conditions at this boundary are @xmath152 , @xmath153 .    as for the downstream ( or lower ) boundary ,",
    "one really does not need to set any conditions there because the @xmath21  coordinate in our model corresponds to time and the new equations have only first - order time derivatives .",
    "now let us derive the differential equations for this model of the separatrix .",
    "the main idea in this derivation is that the convective term @xmath154 is replaced by the time derivative @xmath155 .",
    "the natural unit of time in this model is the alfvn time , the natural unit of distance in the @xmath137  direction is the global scale  @xmath3 , and that of the parallel velocity is the alfvn velocity  @xmath36 .",
    "first of all , one can apply this model only to the part of the separatrix where the field lines are not very strongly curved ( i.e. , where the radius of curvature of the field lines is of order  @xmath3 ) , the magnetic field itself is sufficiently strong ( of order @xmath93 or at least @xmath156 ) , and the perpendicular velocity @xmath157 ( which in ideal mhd is equal to @xmath158 ) is small compared with the parallel velocity @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the model is bound to fail in the very small region near the midplane where the real physical @xmath24 becomes comparable with @xmath22 .    in the system of reference",
    "moving together with the field line in the direction perpendicular to @xmath160 , the ( parallel component of ) the magnetic induction equation becomes @xmath161 and the parallel equation of motion becomes @xmath162 .",
    "\\eqno{(32)}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( 32 ) is equivalent to eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and  ( 11 ) .",
    "physically , the force parallel to @xmath160 is the pressure gradient force which can be expressed in terms of @xmath150 by eq .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the fluid in the initial problem was incompressible , in this 1d problem the motion is effectively not incompressible ( @xmath163 ) , and the thickness of the flux tube ( @xmath164 ) plays the role of density .",
    "now let us see how the back pressure from the separatrix acts on the main layer .",
    "as the field line moves , the incoming velocity @xmath165 increases from almost zero at @xmath121 to about the alfvn velocity , and the incoming magnetic field @xmath166 drops from @xmath93 to zero at the midplane .",
    "therefore , there is a point @xmath167 somewhere in the middle of the left boundary of the separatrix where the incoming flow becomes locally super - alfvnic ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the propagation of information with respect to the fluid in our model occurs at the local alfvn speed by the means of two characteristics @xmath169 . for @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) ,",
    "one characteristic goes from the left boundary @xmath138 ( @xmath76 ) towards the right boundary , while the other characteristic goes from the upper boundary @xmath74 towards the left boundary , carrying information about the pressure and the flow in the separatrix to the main layer .",
    "this means that , for @xmath172 , the layer `` feels '' the effect of the separatrix in the form of the back pressure coming from the previously undisturbed fluid in the separatrix region .",
    "this back pressure is found to have some stabilizing effect , making the solution deep inside the main layer independent of @xmath82 and almost independent of the position @xmath173 of the downstream boundary ( where the separatrix and the main layer solutions are matched ) .",
    "after the field line crosses the point @xmath167 , the flow becomes super - alfvnic and the characteristic @xmath174 is deviated away from the left boundary back into the separatrix region .",
    "now both characteristics come out of the left boundary and there is no propagation of information from the separatrix region into the main layer .",
    "this also means that when the field line reaches the vicinity of the midplane @xmath20 and the description of the separatrix region as a region of almost straight field lines fails , it does not matter much , because the flow at this point is very strongly super - alfvnic and the main layer does not feel what happens downstream .",
    "we would like to remark that in our simulations we have not observed any shock formation in the separatrix .",
    "of course , this picture of the flow of information is valid only in this ideal mhd model . in the real situation with resistivity",
    ", there is always propagation of information upstream due to the resistive diffusion .    to summarize , the model of the separatrix region presented here has two main drawbacks .",
    "first , it describes an ideal mhd separatrix .",
    "second , it _ assumes _ that the boundary conditions on the incoming boundary @xmath138 ( @xmath76 ) are stationary ( i.e. , that the main layer has already reached the steady state ) .",
    "( this second objection can be removed if the main layer is evolved with right hand boundary conditions changing in step with the separatrix solution and _ vice versa _ , but this would involve a longer simulation . ) in addition , the model is valid only when the field lines are essentially straight , as discussed above ( the region where this assumption breaks down is discussed in ref .",
    "despite all that , however , we feel that this model provides a _ qualitatively correct picture of the dynamics in the separatrix region in the steady state _ , and thus gives us sufficiently reasonable downstream boundary conditions for the main layer .",
    "now let us present and discuss the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "we found that , after a transient period of a few alfvn times , _ the system reaches a steady state that is independent of the initial configuration_.    in particular , when we start with a petschek - like initial configuration ( described in section  [ subsec - initial ] ) , the high velocity flow rapidly sweeps away the transverse magnetic field  @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - bx(0,y)-t - petschek ] ) .",
    "this is important , because , for a petschek - like configuration to exist , the transverse component of the magnetic field on the midplane , @xmath175 , must be large enough to be able to sustain the petschek shocks in the field reversal region . for this to happen , has to rise rapidly with  @xmath11 inside a very short diffusion region , @xmath175 @xmath176 ( in the case @xmath177 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - bx(0,y)-t - petschek ] , @xmath120 ) , to reach a certain large value ( @xmath178 for  @xmath179 ) for @xmath180 .",
    "while the transverse magnetic flux is being swept away by the plasma flow , it is being regenerated by the merging of the @xmath24  field , but only at a certain rate and only on a global scale in the @xmath11-direction , related to the nonuniformity of the outside magnetic field  @xmath10 , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the initial petschek - like structure is destroyed , and the inflow of the magnetic flux through the upper boundary drops in a fraction of one alfvn time .",
    "then , after a transient period , the system reaches a steady state consistent with the sweet  parker model .",
    "[ t ]    in general , the transient period typically lasts a few alfvn times , during which the incoming electric field can oscillate around its final steady - state value .",
    "these oscillations have a period of order @xmath181 , and a decay time also of the same order .",
    "after several @xmath181 , the electric field becomes constant and uniform throughout the computational domain and the system approaches steady state .",
    "we terminate our simulations typically after 5 or 10 alfvn times .",
    "the time evolution of the incoming electric field [ i.e. , @xmath182 for different choices of the initial conditions is represented in figs .",
    "[ fig - local - e(t)-sp1 ] and  [ fig - local - e(t)-petschek ] .",
    "[ tbp ]    [ tbp ]    we believe that the fact that we rescaled @xmath21 using the sweet ",
    "parker scaling does not mean that we prescribe the sweet ",
    "parker reconnection rate . indeed ,",
    "if the reconnecting system wanted to evolve towards petschek s fast reconnection , it would then try to develop some new characteristic structures , e.g. , petschek - like shocks , which we would be able to see .",
    "note that , if petschek is correct , then there should be a range of reconnection rates including those equal to any finite factor greater than one times the sweet ",
    "parker rate  @xmath5 .",
    "however , in our simulations we have demonstrated that there is only one stable solution and that it corresponds to  @xmath183 . in this sense",
    "we have demonstrated that petschek must be wrong since reconnection can not even go a factor of two faster than sweet ",
    "parker , let alone almost the entire factor of  @xmath184 .",
    "there seems no alternative to the conclusion that fast reconnection is impossible .",
    "it is interesting that in petschek s original paper  @xcite the length of the central diffusion region @xmath116 is an undetermined parameter , and the reconnection velocity @xmath185 depends on this parameter as @xmath186 .",
    "if @xmath116 is taken as small as possible then petschek finds that @xmath187 .",
    "however , @xmath116 should be determined instead by balancing the generation of the transverse field @xmath22 against its loss by the alfvnic flow ( it should be remarked that petschek did not discuss the origin of this transverse field in his paper ) . as we discussed above , this balance yields @xmath188 , with the resulting unique rate equal to that of sweet  parker .",
    "this results are borne out by our time - dependent numerical simulations .",
    "the final steady - state configuration represents the _ sweet  parker reconnection layer_. this means that all the plasma parameters are of order one in the rescaled coordinates , and change on a scale of order @xmath42 in the @xmath21  direction and on a global scale  @xmath3 in the @xmath11  direction . for our choice of boundary conditions [ i.e. , of the outside magnetic field @xmath10 ] , the reconnection rate in the steady state was @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the typical sweet  parker reconnection rate .",
    "the use of the time - dependent equations allows us not only to find the steady - state solution , but also to draw some conclusions about its stability .",
    "the sweet ",
    "parker solution was found to be stable and robust : it did not depend on the positions of the boundaries @xmath82 , @xmath173 or on the small artificial resistivity and viscosity .",
    "moreover , we found that it is fairly insensitive even with respect to the choice of the parameters describing the outside magnetic field , such as @xmath192 ( thus , @xmath13 varies by about 10% as @xmath93 changes from 0 to 0.3 ) .",

    "this solution corresponds to the following set of the parameters describing the boundary conditions : @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath97 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 [ see eqs .  ( 14 ) and  ( 29 ) ] . in this particular",

    ", the current density @xmath199 rapidly goes to zero as @xmath84 , and @xmath200 monotonically , which means that there is no flux pile up in front of the layer .",
    "the velocity @xmath25 does not quite go to zero at the upper boundary , but its value at @xmath74 is small and goes to zero as the artificial @xmath201 .",
    "next , the solution in the layer shows an essentially linear rise of @xmath25 and @xmath22 along the midplane @xmath20 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig - local - steady - vy(y ) ] and [ fig - local - steady - bx(y ) ] ) .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath202 near @xmath26 , contrary to the cubic behavior predicted by priest and cowley  @xcite , was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( together with the nonanalytic behavior of the solution near the midplane in the limit  @xmath203 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath22 exhibit a sharp change near the downstream boundary @xmath76 , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig - local - steady - bx(y ) ] .",
    "this change is due to the fact that in the separatrix region we neglect the resistive term @xmath204 , which is in fact finite .",
    "that is , the ( perpendicular ) resistivity effectively has a discontinuity across @xmath76 : @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "this discontinuity in the equations also shows up in the solution , but it is smoothed out over some vicinity of @xmath173 by the artificial resistivity and viscosity in the @xmath11  direction . as these @xmath66 , @xmath67 go to zero , the region of the rapid change near @xmath173 becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "[ tbp ]    [ tbp ]    let us add a few remarks about the role of the separatrix region in our simulations .",
    "first , it appears that the destruction of the initially - set - up petschek - like configuration and its conversion to the sweet  parker - like layer is so robust and happens so fast , that it is determined by the dynamics in the main layer and by its interaction with the upstream boundary conditions [ i.e. , with the scale of nonuniformity of the outside magnetic field @xmath10 ] . as a consequence , it has nothing to do with the downstream boundary conditions ( i.e. , with the separatrix region )",
    ". therefore , the fact that our model of the separatrix does not describe the separatrix completely accurately seems to be unimportant , as far as the instability of the petschek solution is concerned .",
    "thus , we believe that the separatrix region , while providing physically reasonable downstream boundary conditions for the main layer problem , does not really have a strong effect on the principal result that the stable steady - state solution is the sweet  parker layer with the sweet",
    " parker reconnection rate .",
    "still , we have to point out that for the solution of the problem to be _ really _ complete , one needs to build a better model of the separatrix region .",
    "such a model would include real time dependence and resistivity , and also would treat the very near vicinity of the endpoint of the reconnection layer .",
    "a proper consideration of the endpoint region _ can not _ be done in rescaled variables , and a further rescaling of variables and matching is needed .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we present a definite systematic solution to a particular clear - cut , mathematically consistent problem concerning the _ internal structure of the reconnection layer _ within the canonical framework ( incompressible 2d mhd with uniform resistivity ) with the outside field @xmath10 varying on the global scale along the layer .",
    "we have first derived a system of rescaled equations that should be valid in the limit @xmath207 .",
    "then , we have developed a 2d resistive mhd code that followed the time evolution of the system in order to achieve the steady state .",
    "we conclude that , under the assumptions of our model , _ the petschek - like solutions are unstable _ and the system quickly evolves to the only stable steady - state solution corresponding to the _ sweet  parker reconnection layer_. thus , the petschek mechanism for fast reconnection does not work in our model .",
    "the steady - state reconnection rate in our model problem is remarkably close to the sweet ",
    "parker value @xmath208 .",
    "this main result is consistent with the results of simulations conducted by biskamp@xcite and also those by ugai@xcite and by scholer@xcite",
    ". it also agrees with the experimental results in the mrx experiment @xcite .    finally , even though we draw our conclusions ( about petschek - like structures being unstable ) only for this very specific model ,",
    "this result is fundamentally important , because this model is the canonical framework typical of most models of magnetic reconnection , including both sweet  parker and petschek .",
    "this framework is the simplest possible framework for a reconnection problem , and thus provides the necessary foundation on top of which one can add more complicated physical processes . because the sweet  parker model with the classical ( spitzer )",
    "resistivity is known to be too slow to explain the very fast time scale for the energy release in solar flares , one has to look for physics beyond resistive mhd with the spitzer resistivity .",
    "the inclusion of some new physical processes into the model ( for example , locally enhanced anomalous resistivity is probably the most suitable candidate ) would create a very different situation in which some petschek - like structure with fast reconnection may be possible .",
    "we are grateful to d.  biskamp , s.  cowley , t.  forbes , m.  meneguzzi , s.  jardin , m.  yamada , h.  ji , s.  boldyrev , and a.  schekochihin for several fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by charlotte elizabeth procter fellowship , by the department of energy contract no .",
    "de - ac02 - 76-cho-3073 , and by nasa s astrophysical program under grant nagw2419 .",
    "we give a rough physical argument for why the length  @xmath209 of the petschek diffusion region must be of order the global length  @xmath3 , and correspondingly , why the petschek reconnection rate must reduce to the sweet  parker rate .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath22 field should have two terms : a loss term @xmath210 , and a source term due to the nonuniform merging of the incoming @xmath24 field .",
    "an estimate for the size of this source term is as follows .",
    "the boundary condition for the external field @xmath24 is determined globally by a field scaled to the global length  @xmath3 . for simplicity , we take this as @xmath211 and apply it over the length of the petschek diffusion layer , @xmath212 .    if the external field were entirely uniform , then the merging of the field in the diffusive region would be uniform and there would be no tendency to develop a @xmath22 field . if the boundary condition on @xmath24 is satisfied and @xmath212 , the tendency to develop @xmath22 by nonuniform merging would be proportional to @xmath213 , the nonuniformity of the external field .",
    "there are several terms leading to the generation of @xmath22 , all of the same order of magnitude .",
    "for example , consider the rate of generation of @xmath22 by the resistive diffusive velocity alone .",
    "let the layer initially have only a @xmath24 field and be of uniform thickness  @xmath214 .",
    "then @xmath215 is stronger at @xmath26 than at @xmath216 by the amount @xmath217 , so the electric field @xmath218 is correspondingly larger .",
    "therefore , the rate at which lines enter at @xmath26 is larger by @xmath219 than that at @xmath220 .",
    "these excess lines must turn from the @xmath11 direction to the @xmath21 direction and produce the @xmath22 field . dividing this rate by @xmath209 we get the rate of generation of the @xmath22 field , @xmath221    one can convince oneself that the other terms , that generate the @xmath22  field such as the variation in the layer thickness  @xmath214 , the variation in the @xmath21 velocity of the plasma , etc .",
    ", are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the above rate @xmath222 should give a rough positive upper bound to the regeneration rate of the @xmath22 field .",
    "therefore , the @xmath22 field can not be stronger than that given by the balance equation @xmath223 so @xmath224 . now , according to petschek , the emerging @xmath22  field drives the shocks at a speed @xmath225 in the @xmath21  direction , which just balances the incoming plasma with velocity @xmath185 ."
