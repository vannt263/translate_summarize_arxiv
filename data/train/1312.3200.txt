    "wyner @xcite introduced the information - theoretic model for confidentiality in noisy communications , called _",
    "wiretap channel _ , where a legitimate transmitter wishes to transmit a confidential message to a legitimate receiver while keeping it hidden from an eavesdropper ( wiretapper ) .",
    "the eavesdropper is assumed to have unlimited computation power , know the coding scheme of the legitimate user , and it only listens to the channel . when the channel to the eavesdropper is a degraded version of the channel to the legitimate receiver , wyner @xcite proposed the secrecy capacity achieving scheme , known also as _ wyner s wiretap channel coding _ , which constitutes of multicoding and randomized encoding ( * ? ? ? * section  22.1.1 ) .",
    "this result is extended to the broadcast channel with confidential message and to the general wiretap channel ( not necessarily degraded ) by csiszr and krner @xcite .",
    "recently , different legitimate - wiretapper user combinations were studied  @xcite . in this line of works , scenarios with multiple eavesdroppers considered only _ non - colluding _ ones .",
    "this implies that information leakage of a certain message to all eavesdropper is computed as the maximum of the leakage to each of them . in some applications ,",
    "this assumption may underestimate the eavesdroppers power : eavesdroppers can collude , i.e. , share their channel outputs ( observations ) , and make the attack more effective @xcite .",
    "hence , combating colluding eavesdroppers , especially in wireless networks , has been a significant challenge  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , all previous works modeled @xmath0 colluding eavesdroppers as one eavesdropper with @xmath0 antennas",
    "; we term this _ perfect colluding _ eavesdroppers . using the equivalent single - input multiple - output ( simo ) gaussian wiretap channel ,",
    "the information leakage is determined by the aggregate signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of all eavesdroppers ; compared to the maximum snr in the non - colluding case @xcite .",
    "this assumption significantly overestimates eavesdropping capability , forcing a legitimate user to increase its power linearly with the number of eavesdroppers to achieve a positive secure rate .",
    "however , collusion ( esp . in the wireless networks ) necessitates communication resources and power consumption .",
    "this , in fact , restricts the collusion channel capacity and thus improves the achievable secure rate by the legitimate user .",
    "hence , here the problem is to find an appropriate model and to analyze the effect of these constraints on the secrecy capacity based on this model .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the potential constraints in collusion , by modeling _ constrained collusion _ with an equivalent wiretap channel , called _ wiretap channel with constrained colluding eavesdroppers _ ( wtc - cce ) . for our _ general",
    "_ wtc - cce , we assume that colluding eavesdroppers communicate ( by defining their channel inputs ) over a virtual _ collusion channel _ , in addition to the main channel .",
    "the higher the collusion channel capacity , the more leaked information can be exchanged .",
    "our model captures previously studied models as special cases : non - colluding with zero collusion rates and perfect collusion with infinite collusion rates .",
    "we also propose a special case , the _ orthogonal _ wtc - cce : the collusion channel is orthogonal to the main one ( unlike the general wtc - cce where eavesdroppers shares the same channel with the legitimate transmitter ) .",
    "first , we derive an achievable secure rate ( a lower bound on the perfect secrecy capacity ) for the general discrete memoryless wtc - cce .",
    "the idea is to let the eavesdroppers do their best in colluding .",
    "hence , the information leakage rate is derived by considering the outer bound on the capacity region of the collusion channel ; this resembles the cut - set upper bound for the relay channel @xcite .",
    "next , we extend our result to the general gaussian wtc - cce and its orthogonal version .",
    "the main difference is that in the general model , the eavesdroppers may use jamming techniques to confuse the legitimate receiver but they could be exposed to the legitimate user . in the orthogonal model , beyond increased required resources , the eavesdroppers may loose some information leakage rate due to not sending jamming signals",
    ". however , the orthogonality may serve eavesdroppers in hiding themselves .",
    "we provide numerical examples to analyze the achievable secure rate and evaluate the overestimation amount ( by comparing to perfect colluding case ) in different scenarios .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : definition ] introduces the channel model and the notations . in section  [ sec : dmc ] , our main results for the general discrete - memoryless channel are presented , while in section  [ sec : gaus ] , the gaussian channel results are stated .",
