    "the cdf collaboration has reported an excess in the production of two jets in association with a @xmath1 boson production  @xcite from data collected at the tevatron with a center - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev and an integrated luminosity of 4.3  fb@xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath1 boson is identified through a charged lepton ( electron or muon ) with large transverse momentum .",
    "the invariant mass of the dijet system is found to be in the range of 120 - 160  gev .",
    "the @xmath0dijet production has a few pb cross - section which is much larger than standard model ( sm ) expectation .",
    "the dijet system may be interpreted as an unidentified resonance with mass around 150  gev which predominantly decays into two hadron jets .",
    "this leads to the speculation that a beyond sm new particle has been found . at present",
    "the deviation from the sm expectation is only at 3.2@xmath7 level .",
    "the excess needs to be further confirmed . on the theoretical side ,",
    "our understanding of the parton distributions and related matter still have room for improvement to make sure that the excess represents genuine new physics beyond the sm  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless studies of new particle explanation has attracted much attention .",

    "common to all of these models is that the new particle must decay predominantly into hadrons ( dijet ) .",

    "@xcite , for example .",
    "the @xmath1+@xmath18 or @xmath99+@xmath18 processes have large cross - sections as can be seen from table  [ table2 ] , especially for the diquark - type models . following the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , by taking into account the qcd @xmath0jets background , the @xmath247 signal in the @xmath76 case can be seen with the signal - to - background ratio of @xmath248 for the events with @xmath249  [ gev ] . assuming the total detection efficiency to be @xmath250 , an expected integrated luminosity for the @xmath251 discovery is @xmath252  [ fb@xmath6 ] in this case . for the color - octet scalar cases ,",
    "the signal - to - background ratio is estimated to be @xmath254 , therefore a better understanding of the background events is needed to find the signal .",
    "we have studied the possibility of explaining the cdf @xmath0dijet excess by introducing colored scalar @xmath18 bosons .",
    "being colored scalars , through coupling to two quarks , they naturally decay into dijet which provides one of the key feature of the @xmath0dijet excess .",
    "there are several colored scalars , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , which can have tree level renormalizable yukawa couplings with two quarks .",
    "not all of them can successfully explain the @xmath0dijet excess .",
    "because the @xmath0dijet excess requires a sizable coupling to the first generation of quarks compared to the higgs couplings to them , the sizable couplings must also be consistent with other existing experimental data .",
    "we have analyzed fcnc constraints from meson - antimeson data .",
    "we find that without forcing of the yukawa couplings to be some special texture forms most of the scalars , except the @xmath258 , are in trouble with fcnc data .",
    "we , however , find that the @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 can be made consistent with all data . while we confined our study to phenomenological implications of these colored particle , we note that a concrete realization of their coupling is harder to achieve .",
    "even one finds a flavor symmetry to forbid certain entries of the yukawa matrices , for example the off  diagonal entries of @xmath109 for the octet , it is often the case that they are induced at loop level . in this sense , all the scenarios discussed here are to be considered as fine  tuned until a concrete realization is achieved .",
    "the candidate of the color triplet scalar is an @xmath40 singlet , and it also produces @xmath98dijet excess at about 1/4 of the @xmath262 process , which is not observed as a bump around 150 gev yet .",
    "we also studied some predictions for the diquark signal at @xmath263 colliders , the rhic and the lhc .",
    "if the cdf excess is the diquark origin , it may be confirmed at the early lhc study . the rhic experiment can help to distinguish the diquarks .      after finishing this work ,",
    "the cdf reported an updated analysis  @xcite using data collected through to november 2010 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.3 fb@xmath6 .",
    "their results are consistent with their early analysis  @xcite and increased the significance to 4.1@xmath7 .",
    "recently d0 collaboration also reported their results of an analysis  @xcite with an integrated luminosity of 4.3 fb@xmath6 .",
    "they did not find similar @xmath0diget excess .",
    "although d0 was also looking at similar excess , the methodology differs in some way which may be potentially important cause for differences .",
    "we are not in a position to decide which one may be correct which has to be settled among the experimental groups . we think that a study of implications of the cdf results is still worthy .",
    "our results are not altered by the new cdf data .",
