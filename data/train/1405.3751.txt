    "we give an answer to this question by constructing a family of stein fillable contact 3-manifolds with @xmath17 and @xmath24 whose stein filling is not diffeomorphic to @xmath22 .",

    "thus the stein fillings of the contact manifolds in the above theorem are candidates for corks , and we may construct an exotic pair .    this note is constructed as follows . in section @xmath6 , we review some definitions and properties of positive lefschetz fibrations and the casson invariant . in section @xmath0 , we prove theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "the proof of this theorem is based on works of loi and piergallini @xcite and akbulut and ozbagci @xcite , who proved that , for any _ positive allowable lefschetz fibration _ ( _ palf _ ) @xmath30 , there exists a stein fillable contact structure @xmath7 on @xmath31 such that @xmath7 is supported by the open book obtained from @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a stein filling of @xmath25 .",
