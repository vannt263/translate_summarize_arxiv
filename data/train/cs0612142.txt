    "since the original work of moore and shannon @xcite , network reliability has been a field devoted to the calculation of the connection probability between different sites of a network constituted by edges ( links , bonds ) and nodes ( vertices , sites ) , each of them having a probability of operating correctly ( the reliability ) .",
    "this field , although mainly developed in an applied background @xcite , is strongly related to graph theory @xcite , combinatorics and algebraic structures @xcite , percolation theory @xcite , as well as numerous lattice models in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , the all - terminal reliability @xmath3 , i.e. , the probability that all nodes are connected , is derived from the tutte polynomial , an invariant of the associated graph , when all edges have the same reliability @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this polynomial appears in the partition function for various potts models , and has been calculated for several families of graphs @xcite ; the location of its complex zeros has also been studied @xcite . the two - terminal reliability @xmath5 , the probability that a source @xmath6 and a destination @xmath7 are connected , is known in percolation theory as the connectivity function or pair connectedness .",
    "it has been used in modeling epidemics or fire propagation @xcite .",
    "this approach is complementary to the effort recently devoted on complex networks , in which the network resilience , i.e. , its robustness against link or node failures ( sometimes following deliberate attacks ) has been studied for ` scale - free ' random graphs @xcite .",
    "exact reliability calculations are known to be very difficult @xcite , except for series - parallel reducible graphs for which only successive simplifications \\{@xmath8 , @xmath9 } are needed . even for planar graphs with identical edge reliabilities @xmath0 and perfect nodes ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) ,",
    "their algorithmic complexity has been classified as # p - hard @xcite . yet",
    ", the development of internet traffic makes it important to assess the overall reliability of network connections , when links _ and _ nodes may fail .    in this work",
    ", we show that for a network represented by an undirected graph @xmath11 , the two - terminal reliability may be expressed as a product of transfer matrices , where _ individual _ edge and node reliabilities are exactly taken into account .",
    "such a factorization , already observed for graph colouring polynomials @xcite , 2d - percolation in square strips @xcite or all - terminal reliability polynomials @xcite , originates with the underlying algebraic structure of the graph .",
    "we apply our method to the two examples ( @xmath12 is the complete graph with @xmath13 nodes ) of figure  [ reseaux ] .",
    "the @xmath14-ladder describes a generic architecture for long - haul connections , while the @xmath15-cylinder slightly generalizes the ` sponge model ' of width three by seymour and welsh @xcite .",
    "when edge and node reliabilities are respectively equal to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a unique transfer matrix is involved ; its largest eigenvalue determines the asymptotic power - law behaviour of reliability as a function of the ladder length .",
    "the location of the complex zeros of @xmath16 exhibits striking structure transitions as @xmath1 decreases from one to zero .",
    "we illustrate the variety of behaviours for the above - mentioned graphs . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we finally give the matrix decomposition for the all - terminal reliability of the @xmath14-ladder with arbitrary edge reliabilities ( the uniform case has already been treated by chang and shrock @xcite ) .",
    "-ladder ( bottom ) @xmath15-cylinder .",
    "links and nodes are identified by their reliabilities : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc . for links , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for nodes .",
    "the source is @xmath22 , the possible destinations are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 . a missing link or node s reliability is simply set to zero . ]",
    "the gist of our method is to simplify the graph by removing links of the @xmath13th ( last ) elementary cell of the network , namely the edges and nodes indexed by @xmath13 , a procedure called pivotal decomposition or deletion - contraction @xcite . if the end terminal @xmath7 ( which can be regarded as perfect ) is connected to node @xmath23 through edge @xmath24 , with respective reliabilities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the graphs where @xmath24 or @xmath23 have been deleted , and @xmath30 the graph where @xmath7 and @xmath23 have been merged through the ` contraction ' of @xmath24 ; ( [ pivotaldecomposition ] ) merely sums probabilities of disjoint events .",
    "this procedure , along with standard series - parallel reductions , is repeated for the three ( instead of the usual two ) secondary graphs in order to take advantage of a structural recursivity of the graph . after a finite number of such reductions , we get replicas of the original graph , albeit with one less elementary cell and with the @xmath31th cell s edge and node reliabilities possibly renormalized by those of the @xmath13th cell , or set to either zero or one . in order to ensure the existence of a recursion relation , the graph structure must be _ closed _ under successive applications of ( [ pivotaldecomposition ] ) ; it may initially require the use of extra edges with symbolic reliabilities , so that all nodes of an elementary cell are connected pair - wise , even if such links do not exist in the graph under consideration . at this point ,",
    "a recursion hypothesis is needed , giving for instance @xmath32 as a sum over specific polynomials in the reliabilities indexed by @xmath13 ; these are often obvious from the @xmath33 value .",
    "going from @xmath34 to @xmath13 provides the transfer matrix linking the prefactors of the polynomials , because @xmath35 is an affine function of each component reliability ; the ( often trivial ) @xmath36 case serves as the initial condition of the recurrence .",
    "three structurally identical , secondary graphs are obtained . ]",
    "let us first illustrate this method by calculating @xmath37 for the @xmath14-ladder ( top of figure  [ reseaux ] ) .",
    "following the guidelines of the preceding section , we first consider @xmath18 for deletion as detailed in figure  [ pivotfirststep ] .",
    "note that the three secondary graphs have essentially the same structure .",
    "the renewed application of ( [ pivotaldecomposition ] ) leads to two families of contributions .",
    "the first one is a sum of @xmath38-like terms with prefactors , in which the ` old ' @xmath39 , ... , @xmath40 are renormalized by one or more of the ` new ' @xmath41 , ... , @xmath42 .",
    "the second one is a sum of @xmath43-like terms .",
    "there is no need for coupled recursion relations for the two destinations @xmath19 and @xmath20 , since they are essentially identical through the permutations @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 may be expressed as the sum of five polynomials in @xmath17 , ... , @xmath20 ( see below ) .",
    "the five prefactors at step @xmath13 are obtained from those at step @xmath34 by a recursion relation which translates as a @xmath48 transfer matrix ( such calculations are routinely performed by mathematical software ) .",
    "the value of @xmath49 leads to @xmath50 where @xmath51 s coefficients @xmath52 are ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 with @xmath55 . in the @xmath56 case , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the five above - mentioned polynomials are actually given by the first row of @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is given by ( [ rel2s0snformelle ] ) if the left vector is @xmath61 .",
    "we have here another useful instance of a product of random matrices @xcite .",
    "the case of identical reliabilities @xmath62 ( unless @xmath63 , see the restriction above ) and @xmath64 is worth investigating , since only the @xmath13th power of a unique matrix needs be taken .",
    "because of the recursion relation between successive values of @xmath65 , the generating function @xmath66 is a rational fraction of @xmath67 .",
    "its denominator @xmath68 is derived from the characteristic polynomial of the transfer matrix , taken at @xmath69 .",
    "the numerator of @xmath70 is then deduced from the computed first terms of the @xmath71 s expansion .",
    "the final result reads : @xmath72 equations  ( [ gechellek4][dechellek4 ] ) are simpler for perfect nodes , because the denominator is of degree 2 in @xmath67 ; a partial fraction decomposition provides @xmath73 , \\\\",

    "the location of the zeros of @xmath16 in the complex plane is also worth investigating .",
    "the situation differs from that for chromatic @xcite and all - terminal polynomials @xcite , because @xmath16 is not a graph invariant .",
    "however , the node reliability @xmath1 is an extra parameter that has a deep impact on the curves to which the zeros of @xmath16 converge as @xmath83 .",
    "the critical values of @xmath1 at which shape transitions occur may be deduced @xcite from the three roots of @xmath84 .",
    "the straightforward but tedious procedures used to determine these values , along with a few asymptotic expansions as @xmath85 , are outlined in the appendix ( they are also applied to the @xmath15-cylinder configuration ) .",
    "we limit ourselves to the final results in the following sections .",
    "a sample of the richness of behaviour is displayed in figures  [ zerosrel2k4rho1.0][zerosrel2k4rho0.01 ] for the @xmath14-ladder and decreasing values of @xmath1 .",
    "we initially observe four well - separated ` curves ' that merge into two when @xmath1 is exactly equal to 0.8 ( see figure  [ zerosrel2k4rho0.8 ] ) and separate again .",
    "when @xmath1 further decreases , other isolated zeros appear , as in figure  [ zerosrel2k4rho0.01 ] .",
    "these zeros occur in pairs , the separation of which vanishes exponentially with @xmath13 , and converge to roots of the algebraic equation @xmath86 equation ( [ equation points isoles ] ) is obtained by ensuring that @xmath87 and @xmath68 have a common root .",
    "the true limiting isolated points are such that this root is the eigenvalue of greatest complex modulus at the given @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "actually , the triplet of figure  [ zerosrel2k4rho0.01 ] appears only when @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a solution of ( see the appendix ) @xmath90 whereas the associated @xmath91 is a solution of @xmath92 if @xmath93 ( the algebraic equation satisfied by @xmath94 is actually of degree 65 in @xmath1 ) , only the two rightmost isolated points are present .",
    "the leftmost isolated point , located on the real negative axis , is asymptotically given by @xmath95 ; for the other two , @xmath1 must be replaced by @xmath96 . by contrast , the algebraic curves asymptotic limit is a circle of radius @xmath97 centred at @xmath98 , demonstrating a different power - law behaviour with @xmath1 . finally , a third critical value @xmath99 also appears , for which we have not been able to find the defining algebraic equation satisfied by @xmath1 ( its degree is likely to be large ) ; at this value , there is an asymptotic ( anti-)crossing of the curves in the vicinity of @xmath100 .",
    "in the second architecture of figure  [ reseaux ] , @xmath22 is still the source while @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the three possible destinations ( the last two are equivalent through a permutation of variables ) .",
    "the crucial point is to take all @xmath101 , because in the successive applications of ( [ pivotaldecomposition ] ) , the merging of nodes entails a secondary graph in which @xmath102 and @xmath103 are connected .",
    "as mentioned above , the dummy  with respect to the manhattan - like strip  link @xmath104 between @xmath105 and @xmath106 must therefore be present right at the start ; this allows us to unveil the _ coupled _ recursion relations between the source and _ all _ the destinations .",
    "each source - destination reliability is a sum of eight polynomials in reliabilities indexed by @xmath13 .",
    "this could lead to @xmath107 transfer matrices @xmath108 .",
    "however , several rows of these matrices , if not identical , are linearly dependent ; rearrangements of terms actually reduce their size to @xmath109 , even when @xmath110 .",
    "the final result reads @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the column vector defined by @xmath113 for @xmath114 ( using the kronecker notation : @xmath115 is equal to 1 if @xmath116 and 0 if @xmath117 ) , and @xmath118 is a row vector which depends on the destination : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",

    "the eigenvalue of greatest modulus @xmath130 involved in the asymptotic power - law behaviour obeys @xmath131 .",

    "the overall structure is more complicated than that for the @xmath14-ladder , but some features are quite similar",
    ".    a segment of the real axis appears as a limit curve when @xmath135 .",
    "these critical values obey different criteria . indeed , the higher one ( with the associated critical , real @xmath136 ) occurs when two complex roots of @xmath137 have the same ( lowest ) modulus as a real negative root of @xmath138 .",
    "by contrast , the lower critical value 0.4202958 appears when @xmath137 exhibits two complex roots and a real positive root with the same modulus ( the critical @xmath0 is about 1.8363587 ) .",
    "what happens when @xmath85 ? the outermost parts of the curves tend asymptotically to a circle of radius @xmath139 , i.e. , approximately @xmath140 . the closed curve on the left survives .",
    "for instance , a triple point @xmath141 goes asymptotically as @xmath142 , with @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( @xmath145 is a root of a polynomial of degree 10 , and @xmath146 is a rational fraction of @xmath147 ) . from each of these points ,",

    "one of them crosses the imaginary axis at @xmath148 , with @xmath149 ( @xmath150 is actually the root of a polynomial of degree 17 ) .      in this case , the generating function @xmath151 is now equal to @xmath152 , where for perfect nodes @xmath153    -cylinder , @xmath101 , @xmath132 and @xmath79 . ]    , with @xmath154 . ]    , with @xmath82 . ]",
    "note that @xmath155 is of degree 4 in @xmath67 ( even when @xmath126 ) , so that a complete analytical solution for the two - terminal reliability could be obtained  but would be very cumbersome .",
    "the location of complex zeros are displayed in figures  [ zerosstreet3nfnneq0rho1.0][zerosstreet3nfnneq0rho0.01 ] .",
    "critical values of different nature occur in this case .",
    "two isolated zeros exist as long as @xmath156 .",
    "they do not survive in the @xmath85 limit , in contrast with the @xmath14 case . for @xmath157 ,",
    "they merge with a continuous curve at @xmath158 .",
    "for these isolated points , the relevant @xmath0 and @xmath1 obey the polynomial constraint @xmath159 the origin of which is similar to that of ( [ equation points isoles ] ) .",
    "another feature is the segment on the real axis ( see figure  [ zerosstreet3nfnneq0rho0.3 ] ) which occurs when @xmath160 .",
    "these two critical values are actually solutions of a polynomial in @xmath1 of degree 95 , and the associated critical @xmath0 s , namely 1.60638989 and 4.56013168 , are also roots of a polynomial in @xmath0 of degree 95 .",
    "these transitions occur when the equation @xmath161 has a double , real ( negative ) root , the opposite of which is also a root .    as in the preceding subsection ,",
    "the global structure expands as @xmath85 .",
    "the outer curves tend asymptotically to a circle of radius @xmath162 .",
    "the closed curve on the left also survives ( see figure [ zerosstreet3nfnneq0rho0.01 ] ) . here",
    "again , it crosses the imaginary axis asymptotically at @xmath163 .",

    "this is a special case of a multivariate tutte polynomial @xcite .",
    "if @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) , we recover chang and shrock s result ( appendix 4.2 of @xcite ) @xmath173 with @xmath174 the asymptotic power - law scaling factor is controlled by @xmath175 with @xmath176 .",
    "the two - terminal reliability of undirected networks may be expressed by a product of transfer matrices , in which each edge and node reliability is exactly taken into account .",
    "this result is easily extended to the all - terminal reliability with nonuniform links , as well as to directed graphs .",
    "we can now go beyond series - parallel simplifications and look for new ( wider ) families of exactly solvable , meshed architectures that may be useful for general reliability studies ( as building blocks for more complex networks ) , for the enumeration of self - avoiding walks on lattices , and for percolation with imperfect bonds _ and _ sites . since the true generating function is itself a rational fraction , pad approximants should provide efficient upper or lower bounds for these studies .",
    "moreover , individual reliabilities can be viewed as average values of random variables .",
    "having access to _ each _ edge or node allows the introduction of disorder or correlations in calculations .",
    "the location of complex zeros of the two - terminal reliability polynomials exhibits numerous structure transitions , with the possible occurrence of isolated points , convergence to segments of the real axis , and also an expansion from the origin as @xmath1 goes to 0 which obeys power - law behaviours with rational exponents which may differ strongly for seemingly not too dissimilar graphs .",
    "all critical values of the node reliability are actually algebraic values .",
    "finally , in a more applied perspective , let us mention that the failure frequency @xmath177 of a given connection is another important performance index of networks .",
    "if equipment @xmath178 with reliability @xmath179 has a failure rate @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "the matrix factorization makes the calculation straightforward , since each @xmath179 appears in one transfer matrix only .    very helpful information and suggestions by n.  l.  biggs , n.  bontemps , r.  combescot ,  .",

    "our method relies on well - known results for the zeros of recursively defined one - parameter polynomials @xcite .",
    "since we are dealing here with two - variate ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) polynomials , let us outline the procedure used to obtain the figures , the critical values , and the asymptotic expansions given in the text .",
    "as shown by many published studies , the convergence of the zeros to limiting sets of algebraic curves is already apparent for @xmath13 roughly equal to 50 . to be on the safe side , we calculated these polynomials for @xmath182 or @xmath183 in order to ( i )",
    "be very close to the asymptotic limit ( ii ) get a good sampling of the zeros , since  especially in the small-@xmath1 limit  they are not uniformly distributed over the asymptotic curves when @xmath184 ( see figures  [ zerosstreet3nfneq0rho1.0][zerosstreet3nfneq0rho0.1 ] and [ zerosstreet3nfnneq0rho0.01 ] ) .",
    "we have calculated these polynomials using mathematica and recursion relations based on the denominator of the generating function . if @xmath185 then @xmath186 knowledge of the first @xmath187 polynomials deduced from the generating function allows the quick determination of @xmath188 for a given @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 has not been kept as a parameter because of the explosion in the number of terms , but has been given rational values in order to prevent numerical errors ; this gives polynomials with integral coefficients that may be very large ( hundreds of digits sometimes ) .",

    "the zeros of recursively defined ( one - parameter ) polynomials mostly tend to aggregate close to curves such as ( at least ) two eigenvalues have the same modulus ( the largest one for all the eigenvalues ) .",
    "assuming that the ratio of the two eigenvalues is equal to @xmath189 , we can write @xmath190 which must be compared with ( [ denominateur d(z ) general ] ) .",

    "replacing @xmath7 by the more practical @xmath194 gives a polynomial constraint @xmath195 .",
    "however , the true limiting curves are defined by only a subset of this constraint s many solutions for a given @xmath1 and @xmath196 ranging from -1 to + 1 , because @xmath197 must be the largest . in this context",
    ", it does no harm to investigate special points of these curves .",
    "in our case studies the endpoints of the limiting curves are such that both roots are equal ( @xmath199 or equivalently @xmath200 ) : they are thus obtained from a subset of the solutions of @xmath201 . for the @xmath14-ladder with @xmath79 ,",
    "this leads to @xmath202 which gives the true endpoints of figure  [ zerosrel2k4rho1.0 ] : @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 ( all the solutions are actually roots of the polynomial of degree 8) . a quicker way to find these endpoints is to investigate when @xmath68 and @xmath207 are both equal to zero .",

    "indeed , they pinpoint the limiting curves and can be obtained more easily because they satisfy @xmath198 and @xmath209 . considering the even and odd components of @xmath68 as functions of @xmath210 and performing the elimination of @xmath211 gives a new constraint @xmath212 , which is nothing but @xmath213 . this task is simpler because the degree of the polynomials has been divided by two ( this definitely helps because even computer - assisted computations become ugly when the degree of @xmath68 increases ) .",
    "a few real zeros may correspond to opposite roots . for the @xmath14-ladder with @xmath79 , -0.2430623 and 1.527648",
    "are indeed two such examples of intersections of the curves with the real axis , which may ultimately be tracked down to solutions of @xmath214 ( see figure [ zerosrel2k4rho1.0 ] ) .",
    "they are frequent features of the complex zeros structure .",
    "we mentioned in the previous paragraph that algebraic curves may intersect the real axis at a given @xmath0 , the location of which can be traced back to particular roots of @xmath198 .",
    "whole segments of the real ( positive or negative ) axis may also occur for some graphs ( see figures  [ zerosstreet3nfneq0rho0.6 ] and [ zerosstreet3nfnneq0rho0.3 ] ) .",
    "it happens when , for a fixed @xmath1 , two complex conjugate eigenvalues have the largest modulus for an extended range of real @xmath0 s .",
    "the proper assessment of the endpoints of this segment generally requires careful , numerical tests of the roots of @xmath198 .",
    "the existence of segments of the real axis may be restricted to a limited range of @xmath1 s or may persist down to @xmath85 ; it depends on the graph under consideration .",
    "when an algebraic curve ( _ and its symmetrical twin with respect to the real axis ) _ crosses the real axis , we have @xmath195 and @xmath215 , because @xmath0 is a double ( real ) root at the intersection .",

    "this occurs when three roots of @xmath198 have the same modulus .",
    "these points are usually harder to pinpoint in practice , especially away from the real axis .      changes  sometimes quite drastic  in the global structure of the complex zeros occur at particular values of @xmath1 : the apparition or disappearance of real segments , isolated zeros , and small closed curves .",
    "these changes take place when , as @xmath1 varies , different pairs of eigenvalues have the largest modulus .",
    "such a situation may be described in the following , simplified way .",
    "let us assume that a particular point of the complex zeros structure is described by @xmath217 .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , this feature s origin changes and can be traced back to _ another _ constraint @xmath218 . at the critical ( @xmath219 )",
    ", both constraints must be satisfied .",
    "elimination of one variable among @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads to the desired critical value .",
    "since @xmath1 is kept real , we usually eliminate @xmath0 . not surprisingly , @xmath220 is a root of an algebraic equation , the degree and ( integral ) coefficients of which may become quite large .",
    "for instance , let us consider the apparition of the _ third _ isolated zero in the @xmath14-ladder configuration .",
    "its existence is based on ( [ equation points isoles ] ) , which is apparently satisfied for @xmath221 .",
    "when @xmath1 is slightly smaller than @xmath220 , the isolated zero  which remains on the real axis  approaches the leftmost algebraic curve , which intersects the real axis at a point such that @xmath213 . @xmath220 and",
    "the associated @xmath222 are therefore defined by their obeying the following two conditions , ( [ equation points isoles ] ) and @xmath223 the elimination of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 leads to the defining algebraic equation for the remaining parameter , which can be expressed as a product of polynomials .",
    "comparison with the numerical data ( one can always bracket @xmath220 or @xmath222 by trial and error ) allows to select the relevant polynomial , given in ( [ equation rho critique k4 troisieme zero isole ] ) and ( [ equation p critique k4 troisieme zero isole ] ) .",
    "obviously , the elimination procedure , which heavily relies on computer software ( mathematica in the present case ) , works best when the degrees ( in the variables to be eliminated ) of the polynomials are not too large",
    ". a point may be worth mentioning : finding critical values involving only real @xmath220 and @xmath222 is usually much easier than for a real @xmath220 and complex conjugate @xmath222 s , because @xmath222 is associated with @xmath224 which is seldom equal to @xmath225 .",
    "we have been able to calculate the critical @xmath220 corresponding to the apparition of the first two isolated ( complex conjugate ) zeros for the @xmath14-ladder , by considering the conditions @xmath195 and ( [ equation points isoles ] ) , which can be decomposed in real and imaginary parts .",
    "this gives four equations and four parameters , namely @xmath1 , @xmath196 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 .",
    "while it does not present any conceptual difficulty , this task may become numerically challenging since after each elimination procedure , the degrees in the remaining variables have a tendency to ` explode ' .",
    "suffice it to say that the polynomial defining this critical @xmath220 is of degree 65 , much larger than the degree 10 exhibited by ( [ equation rho critique k4 troisieme zero isole][equation p critique k4 troisieme zero isole ] ) .",
    "our general method is to first assess numerically the expansion rate of the different substructures , which must behave as a negative fractional power of @xmath1 ( because of the polynomial constraints in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "this can be done by calculating the complex zeros for @xmath1 equal to @xmath228 , @xmath229 , etc .",
    "for instance , we infer from numerical calculations that the isolated zeros move from the origin with an expansion rate proportional to @xmath230 .",
    "setting @xmath231 in ( [ equation points isoles ] ) gives to lowest order @xmath232 and implies that @xmath233 .",
    "the leading term is therefore easily obtained , down to its prefactor ( note the symmetry of order 3 lying at the heart of the triplet of isolated zeros ) .",
    "the following terms of the asymptotic expansion may be deduced iteratively in a straightforward way .    as regards the sets of algebraic curves , the procedure is identical , with possibly different exponents . the ` best ' equation to start with",
    "is obtained for opposite roots ( see above ) .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath234 in ( [ equation t egal -1 k4-ladder ] ) gives @xmath235 , implying @xmath236 .",
    "note that because the asymptotic structure is not strictly circular , the following terms of the expansion may depend on the argument ( not only on the modulus ) of the leading term of @xmath237 .",
    "finally , in such cases as the @xmath15-cylinder with @xmath122 , the above procedure gives several possible analytical solutions for @xmath237 with an expansion rate in @xmath238 , with very close numerical values which makes the correct identification of the true prefactor quite tedious .",
    "after careful numerical tests , we finally identified the expansion rate as @xmath139 .",
    "the elements @xmath239 of the @xmath109 transfer matrix @xmath108 are @xmath240    all the following matrix elements are equal to zero : @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 , @xmath278 .    note that for @xmath279 , one must set @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
