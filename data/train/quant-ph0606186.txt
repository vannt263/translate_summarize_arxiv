    "recently , a new axiom for quantum mechanics , called the hardy axiom , has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "this axiom is the bedrock of the bohm - gadella theory , which is meant to be a `` _ consistent and exact theory of quantum resonances and decay _ ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bohm - gadella theory was initially formulated in the late 1970s  @xcite , and it was a creative attempt to accommodate states for nonrelativistic resonances , the `` gamow vectors ''  @xcite .",
    "a byproduct of the bohm - gadella theory was that the time evolution of the `` gamow vectors '' is given by a semigroup rather than by a group , expressing time asymmetry at the microscopic level .",
    "the bohm - gadella theory was subsequently refined in  @xcite . with further improvements",
    ", it was summarized in  @xcite .",
    "the single most important mathematical piece of the bohm - gadella theory is the rigged hilbert space of hardy class .    in 1994 ,",
    "the bohm - gadella theory received a boost from the preparation - registration arrow of time  @xcite .",
    "the preparation - registration arrow of time provides , by means of causality , the physical justification for the hardy axiom and thus also for the bohm - gadella theory .",
    "after several review articles , and after extending the theory to relativistic resonances  @xcite , the assumptions of the bohm - gadella theory have been explicitly formulated as a new axiom for quantum mechanics , the hardy axiom  @xcite . the state of the art of the bohm - gadella theory can be found in review  @xcite .",
    "if we denote the lippmann - schwinger bras by @xmath0 , and the `` in '' and `` out '' wave functions by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then the hardy axiom states that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hardy functions . by using the hardy axiom , the two major achievements of the bohm - gadella theory , the `` gamow vectors '' and time asymmetry , are readily obtained .",
    "although its goals are worth pursuing , the bohm - gadella theory suffers from at least two major problems .",
    "first , the bohm - gadella theory is purely formal , that is , nobody has found a potential to which such a theory applies .",
    "the way the bohm - gadella theory works is by _ presupposing _ that the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation are distributions acting on two spaces of hardy functions . in the bohm - gadella theory ,",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation is never solved , and one gets along by means of the hardy - function assumption .",
    "second , and more important , the content of the hardy axiom is not a matter of assumption , but a matter of proof .",
    "the properties of the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation can not be simply assumed ; rather , one must solve the lippmann - schwinger equation and derive the properties of its solutions .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a critical examination of the bohm - gadella theory .",
    "we will show that the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation do not comply with the hardy axiom , thereby showing that the bohm - gadella theory is inconsistent with standard quantum mechanics . in order to show this",
    ", we will use the example of the spherical shell potential and the results of  @xcite , where that same potential was used to obtain the rigged hilbert spaces that accommodate the lippmann - schwinger equation  @xcite and its analytic continuation  @xcite .    as mentioned above , the justification for the hardy axiom comes from causality , by way of the preparation - registration arrow of time . since the preparation - registration arrow of time seems so compelling , one might still think that the hardy axiom must be correct , and that there must be some subtlety missing in our analysis . to dispel any remaining doubts , we will show that the derivation of the preparation - registration arrow of time is actually flawed .",
    "thus , neither hardy functions appear when we solve the lippmann - schwinger equation , nor there is a physical reason why they should .",
    "in addition , we will see that not only the hardy axiom but also other aspects of the bohm - gadella theory are inconsistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "furthermore , the two major achievements of the bohm - gadella theory , the resonance states and time asymmetry , can be achieved within standard quantum mechanics .",
    "thus , the bohm - gadella theory is not only inconsistent with quantum mechanics , but also unnecessary .",
    "in sec .  [",
    "sec : hfreview ] , we review the properties of hardy functions .",
    "as well , we recall the precise statement of the hardy axiom .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : alinfar ] , we show that the behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath6 does not comply with the hardy axiom . more specifically , we will show that whereas the hardy axiom implies that the analytic continuation of @xmath5 ( respectively @xmath6 ) vanishes on the lower ( respectively upper ) infinite arc of the second sheet of the riemann surface , the truly quantum mechanical @xmath5 and @xmath6 blow up exponentially in that infinite arc .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : prat ] , we show that the derivation of the preparation - registration arrow of time is flawed .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrumh ] , we argue that the semiboundedness of the hamiltonian seems to be the reason why the hardy axiom does not apply in quantum mechanics .    in secs .",
    "[ sec : gsdbsss ] and  [ sec : gsdbs ] , we compare the most salient features of the bohm - gadella theory with standard quantum mechanics .    before turning to the main body of the paper",
    ", we would like to make three remarks .",
    "first , although we will focus on the spherical shell potential for zero angular momentum , our results are valid for any partial wave and for a large class of potentials that include , in particular , potentials of finite range .",
    "the reason why our results are valid for such a large class of potentials is that , ultimately , such results depend on whether one can analytically continue the jost and scattering functions into the whole complex plane . since",
    "such continuation is possible for potentials that fall off at infinity faster than any exponential  @xcite , our results remain valid for a whole lot of potentials . what is more , when the tails of the potential fall off slower than exponentials , the analytic properties of the jost and scattering functions are even in more disagreement with the hardy axiom .",
    "second , although the results of this paper render the rigged hilbert space of hardy class unsuitable for the lippmann - schwinger equation , the rigged hilbert spaces of  @xcite lie at the heart of the foundations of the lippmann - schwinger equation . and third , it is not that the math of the bohm - gadella theory is wrong , it is rather that the math of the bohm - gadella theory is inconsistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "in this section , we list the definition and main properties of functions of hardy class .      a hardy function @xmath7 on the upper half of the complex plane @xmath8 is a function satisfying the following conditions @xcite :    * it is analytic on the open upper half - plane , i.e. , on the set of complex numbers with positive imaginary part . * for any value of @xmath9 , the integral @xmath10 converges .",
    "* for all @xmath9 , these integrals are bounded by the same constant @xmath11 , @xmath12    the set of hardy functions on the upper half - plane , often referred to as hardy functions from above , is a linear space that we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , hardy functions on the lower half - plane @xmath14 are analytic on the open lower half - plane , and for these functions the conditions  ( [ 68 ] ) and ( [ 69 ] ) hold with @xmath15 .",
    "we denote the linear space of hardy functions from below by @xmath16 .",
    "any hardy function @xmath7 has a unique boundary value @xmath17 on the real axis : @xmath18 the boundary value @xmath17 is square integrable , and its squared norm is also bounded by @xmath11 : @xmath19 thus , a function in @xmath20 uniquely determines a square integrable function on @xmath21 .    an important theorem , due to titchmarsh  @xcite , states that hardy functions can be recovered from their boundary values on the real line . if @xmath17 is the function representing the boundary values of a hardy function @xmath7 on @xmath22 , then @xmath23 where the signs ( @xmath24 ) and ( @xmath25 ) correspond to hardy functions on the upper and lower half - planes , respectively .",
    "this one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath26 functions and their boundary values on @xmath21 allows the identification of @xmath7 with @xmath17 for @xmath27 .",
    "another important theorem on hardy functions is that by paley and wiener  @xcite .",
    "the theorem asserts that if @xmath28 , then the fourier transform of @xmath29 , @xmath30 has the property @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath33 , then the fourier transform of @xmath29 has the property @xmath31 for @xmath34 .",
    "the paley - wiener theorem is the major reason why hardy functions have been widely used in causality problems in which the frequency ( energy ) runs through the entire real line  @xcite .    a theorem due to van winter  @xcite establishes that a hardy function can be recovered from just its boundary values on the positive real axis @xmath35 .",
    "whether the recovered function is an element of @xmath13 or @xmath16 is determined by means of the mellin transform .",
    "thus , if we call @xmath36 the space of boundary values on @xmath37 of the functions in @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the space of boundary values on @xmath37 of the functions in @xmath16 , we have the following bijection : @xmath40 where the image of any @xmath41 by @xmath42 is a function which is equal to @xmath43 for @xmath44 and is not defined for negative values of @xmath45 .",
    "the following are among the other interesting properties of hardy functions  @xcite :    * let us define the hilbert transform for an @xmath46 function @xmath29 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "the hilbert transform is linear and its image also lies in @xmath46 .",
    "a square integrable complex function @xmath17 , with real part @xmath49 and imaginary part @xmath50 , belongs to @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 in particular , a hardy function can not be either real or purely imaginary on the whole real line . * from (",
    "_ i _ ) , we immediately see that @xmath53 if and only if its complex conjugate @xmath54 . *",
    "a function @xmath29 of @xmath13 ( respectively @xmath16 ) vanishes in the infinite arc of the upper ( respectively lower ) half - plane : @xmath55 more precisely , hardy functions behave for large values of @xmath56 as @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . * the spaces @xmath13 and @xmath16 have a trivial intersection , @xmath58 however , the spaces of functions which are restrictions of hardy functions to the positive semiaxis @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath39 , have a nontrivial intersection  @xcite , @xmath59 moreover , the intersection @xmath60 is dense in @xmath61 .",
    "two pairs of rigged hilbert spaces of hardy class form the backbone of the bohm - gadella theory .",
    "the first pair is given by  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the schwartz space on the real line .",
    "the second pair is constructed as follows .",
    "we mentioned earlier that hardy functions are determined by their values on the positive real axis plus a specification which says if they are hardy on the upper or the lower half - planes .",
    "thus , we have defined the spaces @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "now consider @xmath66 the spaces @xmath67 are dense in @xmath61 and yield the second pair of rigged hilbert spaces of hardy class  @xcite : @xmath68      if we denote the lippmann - schwinger bras by @xmath0 , and if we denote the `` in '' and the `` out '' wave functions by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then the hardy axiom states that @xmath69 @xmath70 by  ( [ limiifn ] ) , these assumptions imply , in particular , that the analytic continuation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 tend to zero in , respectively , the lower and upper infinite arcs of the second sheet of the riemann surface : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 denote the upper ( @xmath24 ) and the lower ( @xmath25 ) half - planes of the second sheet .",
    "as we will see in the next section , in quantum mechanics these limits are not zero , and therefore @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not hardy functions .",
    "we are going to see that the limits  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) and ( [ asymlim- ] ) are in general not zero by way of a simple counterexample .",
    "we will focus on the limit  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) , since the same arguments apply to the limit  ( [ asymlim- ] ) .",
    "the simple counterexample we will use is the spherical shell potential : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a positive constant that determines the strength of the potential , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 determine the positions in between which the potential is nonzero .",
    "we will work in the radial , position representation for zero angular momentum and take @xmath78 . in this representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath79 acts as @xmath80 the lippmann - schwinger eigenfunctions are given by  @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a delta - normalization factor , @xmath83 @xmath84 is the so - called regular solution , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the jost functions , @xmath87 @xmath88 the explicit expressions for @xmath89-@xmath90 can be obtained by matching the values of @xmath84 and of its derivative at the discontinuities of the potential .",
    "if we denote the `` in '' wave function in the position representation by @xmath91 , then the `` in '' wave function in the energy representation , @xmath92 , is given by  @xcite @xmath93 the analytic continuation of @xmath92 into the complex plane can be readily obtained by analytically continuing @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "the resulting analytic continuations are denoted by @xmath95 and @xmath96 : @xmath97    in order to show that the limit  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) does not hold , we will compare that limit with the pace at which @xmath95 grows in the lower half - plane of the second sheet . from eq .",
    "( [ lsinteexpre+a ] ) and from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we know that such a pace is determined by the falloff of @xmath91 as @xmath98 tends to infinity and by the growth of @xmath96 , which we now obtain",
    ".    the growth of @xmath96 is determined by the growths of the regular solution and of the inverse of @xmath99 , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ pmeigndu ] ) . in its turn",
    ", the growth of the regular solution is given by the following estimate ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( 12.6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a constant . in the lower half - plane of the second sheet ,",
    "the growth of @xmath102 can be shown to be bounded by a constant  @xcite : @xmath103 the combination of the last two inequalities with eq .",
    "( [ pmeigndu ] ) yields the growth of @xmath96 in the lower half - plane of the second sheet : @xmath104 hence , when @xmath105 , @xmath96 blows up _ exponentially _ as @xmath56 tends to infinity .    by using the estimate  ( [ boundls- ] ) and the gelfand - shilov theory of @xmath106 and @xmath107 functions  @xcite , one can obtain the growth of @xmath95 from the falloff of @xmath91 , see  @xcite .",
    "the result is that if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are positive real numbers satisfying @xmath108 and if @xmath91 is an infinitely differentiable function whose tails fall off like @xmath109 , then @xmath95 grows like @xmath110 in the infinite arc of the energy plane : @xmath111 thus , when in the position representation a function has tails , in the energy representation it blows up faster than any exponential , and therefore it can not be a hardy function , since the blowup  ( [ blowupfex ] ) contradicts the limit  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) demanded by the hardy axiom .",
    "one could think of saving the limit  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) by imposing further restrictions on the falloff of @xmath91 at infinity , because such restrictions slow down the growth of @xmath95 .",
    "the strongest restriction of this kind is to impose that @xmath91 be an infinitely differentiable function with compact support , @xmath112 .",
    "however , as we are going to see , functions of compact support do not comply with the limit  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) either .",
    "let us take @xmath112 such that @xmath113 when @xmath114 .",
    "then , @xmath115 that is , when @xmath112 , @xmath95 blows up _ exponentially _ in the infinite arc of @xmath116 : @xmath117 quite a contrast to the limit  ( [ asymlim+ ] ) .",
    "thus , no matter how small the tails of the wave functions in the position representation are , in the energy representation the wave functions blow up at least _ exponentially _ in the infinite arc of @xmath116 , in contradiction to the limit  ( [ asymlim+])the hardy axiom is inconsistent with the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the preparation - registration arrow of time provides the physical justification for the hardy axiom . in this section",
    ", we will demonstrate that the derivation of the preparation - registration arrow of time is flawed , thereby demonstrating that the hardy axiom lacks a physical basis .",
    "the derivation of the preparation - registration arrow of time can be found , for example , in section  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite and in section  iii of ref .",
    "@xcite , and it goes as follows .",
    "a scattering experiment consists of a preparation stage and a registration stage . in the preparation stage ,",
    "a beam is prepared in an initial state @xmath118 before the interaction @xmath119 is turned on .",
    "the initial state @xmath118 evolves according to the free hamiltonian @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "when the beam reaches the interaction region , the free initial state @xmath118 turns into the exact `` in '' state @xmath1 , which evolves according to the total hamiltonian @xmath79 , @xmath122 .",
    "the beam then leaves the interaction region and ends up as the state @xmath123 .    in the registration stage",
    ", the detector outside the interaction region does in general not detect @xmath123 but rather the overlap of @xmath123 with a final state @xmath124 .",
    "the state @xmath124 evolves according to the free hamiltonian and corresponds to an exact `` out '' state @xmath2 .",
    "the `` out '' state @xmath2 evolves according to the total hamiltonian .",
    "a well - known result of scattering theory is that the states @xmath118 , @xmath1 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 satisfy @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 are the eigenbras of @xmath120 , and @xmath0 are the lippmann - schwinger bras .",
    "one now takes @xmath129 as the time before which the preparation of @xmath118 is completed , and after which the registration of @xmath124 begins .",
    "then , as the mathematical statement for `` no preparations for @xmath34 , '' one takes @xmath130 for all energies , which implies @xmath131 or @xmath132 as the mathematical statement for `` no registrations for @xmath32 , '' one takes @xmath133 for all energies , which implies @xmath134 or @xmath135 by the paley - wiener theorem , eq .",
    "( [ ferftvph+ ] ) implies that @xmath136 is a hardy function from below , and eq .",
    "( [ ferftvps- ] ) implies that @xmath137 is a hardy function from above .",
    "hence the claim that the hardy axiom is rooted in causality principles .",
    "we are now in a position to reveal the flaws of the preparation - registration arrow of time . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the `` in '' states , since the same arguments apply to the `` out '' states .",
    "the first flaw lies in assumption  ( [ flawassum ] ) .",
    "from such an assumption , it follows that @xmath138 for all energies . hence , @xmath139 for all energies , which can happen only when @xmath140 is identically 0 .",
    "thus , the preparation - registration arrow of time holds only in the meaningless case of the zero wave function .    condition  ( [ ferftvph+ ] ) , on which condition the hardy axiom rests , is weaker than the flawed assumption  ( [ flawassum ] ) .",
    "one may then think of saving the hardy axiom by assuming simply eq .",
    "( [ ferftvph+ ] ) , which by the paley - wiener theorem is equivalent to assuming that @xmath92 is a hardy function from below .",
    "this way of stating the hardy axiom , which is the way used in refs .",
    "@xcite , is tantamount to the causal condition `` @xmath141 for @xmath34 . ''",
    "the problem is that this causal condition is dead - end , because the quantum mechanical time evolution of @xmath140 , @xmath142 is _ different _ from @xmath143 : @xmath144 it is clear from this equation that any statement on the the causal behavior of @xmath143 will in general not apply to the true quantum mechanical evolved state @xmath145 ( even if @xmath140 were a hardy function ) .",
    "therefore , there is no reason why the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation should be related to hardy functions .",
    "one could have foreseen that the causality principles of the hardy axiom are inconsistent with quantum mechanics by recalling that in standard scattering theory , a beam is prepared at @xmath146 , hits the target , and outgoes to infinity at @xmath147 , and therefore its time evolution lasts from @xmath146 till @xmath147 .",
    "three remarks are in order here .",
    "( 1 ) because @xmath148 is unitary , @xmath149 if and only if @xmath150 .",
    "thus , there is little hope of having @xmath151 for any @xmath34 , since such condition forces @xmath140 to vanish .",
    "( 2 ) if the argument behind the preparation - registration arrow of time was physically sound , it would apply to any quantum mechanical energy distribution , not just to those associated with the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "also , it would apply to any system , be it quantum or classical .",
    "( 3 ) the entire real line of energies has been used in eq .",
    "( [ ferftvph+ ] ) , whereas the quantum mechanical time evolution  ( [ qmtimevo ] ) uses the physical spectrum @xmath152 .",
    "that the paley - wiener theorem makes use of the entire real line of energies through the fourier transform  ( [ ftpwthe ] ) seems to indicate that hardy functions fit systems where energy ( frequency ) integrations are taken over the whole real line , rather than quantum mechanical systems , the majority of which have spectra bounded from below .",
    "this important point is known to some authors .",
    "for example , nussenzveig  @xcite and van kampen  @xcite utilize @xmath26 functions in causality problems of classical electromagnetic scattering , where the frequency integrals are taken over the entire real line .",
    "however , both nussenzveig  @xcite and van kampen  @xcite avoid the use of @xmath26 functions in non - relativistic scattering , where the spectrum is bounded from below . in this section",
    ", we are going to delve into why hardy functions are not suitable for systems whose spectrum is bounded from below .",
    "we start by recalling a basic result of the spectral theory of linear operators on a hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath153 denote a self - adjoint operator on a hilbert space @xmath154 , and let @xmath155 denote its spectrum . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the spectrum of @xmath153 is purely continuous",
    ". associated with each @xmath156 , there is a ket @xmath157 that is a ( generalized ) eigenvector of @xmath153 : @xmath158 in practical applications , eq .",
    "( [ aeieque ] ) is solved in the position representation : @xmath159 this equation has in general solutions for any complex @xmath160 , even though the spectrum of a self - adjoint operator is real . the @xmath160 s of @xmath155 are distinguished from the rest of real and complex numbers by the fact that their corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath161 are polynomially bounded  @xcite .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ aeiequexre ] ) for @xmath162 can then be used to express the norm of a sufficiently smooth function @xmath29 and the expectation of @xmath153 in @xmath29 : @xmath163 @xmath164 it is important to note that in these integrals , @xmath160 runs over the physical spectrum .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian  ( [ doh ] ) are given by eq .",
    "( [ pmeigndu ] ) . as eq .",
    "( [ boundrs ] ) shows , the eigenfunctions  ( [ pmeigndu ] ) are polynomially bounded only when @xmath165 , and therefore the spectrum of @xmath79 is the positive real line .",
    "thus , when we apply the last two equations to @xmath79 and @xmath140 , we obtain @xmath166 @xmath167 note that in these two integrals , the energy ranges from @xmath168 to @xmath169 .",
    "we now recall that the hardy axiom implies that the following integrals over the entire real line are finite : @xmath170 @xmath171 from eqs .",
    "( [ scpphs])-([haxconneg2 ] ) it follows that @xmath172 @xmath173 thus , if the hardy axiom held , the integrals over the negative real line would be finite . as we are going to see ,",
    "this is not so .",
    "when @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the estimate  ( [ stepsforlous ] ) becomes @xmath176 and therefore @xmath92 blows up exponentially when @xmath45 tends to @xmath177 , @xmath178 in addition , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : alinfar ] , when @xmath91 has non - vanishing tails , the growth of @xmath95 outpaces  ( [ stepsforlouseng ] ) .",

    "( [ spfg])-([spea ] ) would be taken over the full real line .",
