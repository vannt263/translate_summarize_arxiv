    "fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) fluids are observed at low temperature in clean two - dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite each of them possesses unique topological order and is characterized by a number of universal invariants such as the hall conductance and the fractional charges and braiding statistics of the elementary quasiparticle excitations.@xcite in quantum hall droplets realizable in semiconductor quantum dots , a microscopic number of electrons forms an analogous correlated fluid .",
    "while the universalities are no longer exactly valid , the system can be accurately studied by various non - perturbative numerical methods combined with the understanding of the quantum hall effects.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate a cylindrically - symmetric electron droplet separated from a surrounding electron ring by a tunable barrier .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed strong so that the electrons are spin - polarized and reside on the lowest fock - darwin band .",
    "@xcite we find the ground state phase diagram for 6 electrons . when the ring and dot are weakly coupled , the ground state angular momenta form a diamond structure , following from the conservation of the total angular momentum in the combined system .",
    "this structure is gradually lost as the systems become strongly coupled .",
    "finally , the effects of the potential wall when all the electrons are in the dot are analyzed .",
    "an earlier theoretical study of transport properties of a similar ring - dot structure , albeit with weaker magnetic field , showed evidence of a transport blockade due to the system geometry.@xcite later it was suggested that due to the piecewise linear dependence of the singlet - triplet splitting , a ring - dot geometry would be a good candidate for a realization of magnetic field controllable pair of spin qubits.@xcite we are unaware of experiments conducted with this type of concentric laterally coupled quantum - dot - quantum - ring systems .",

    "the material dependent parameters are @xmath4 , the effective mass of an electron , and @xmath5 ( cgs ) , the dielectric constant of gaas semiconductor medium . the confinement potential and the barrier between the quantum dot and quantum ring are given by @xmath6 the potential barrier separating the two subsystems is approximated by a delta function at radius @xmath7 scaled by strength @xmath8 . in this model that aims to capture the essential properties , we neglect the effects of small thickness of the sample@xcite and screening by near - by metallic gates to the coulomb interaction .    in the calculations",
    ", we set the confinement strength @xmath9 to @xmath10 as its scaling should merely shift the ranges of magnetic fields for different phases .",
    "lengths are written in units of oscillator length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is solved by constructing the many - body hamiltonian matrix in the basis of spin - polarized lowest fock - darwin band and finding its lowest eigenstate by the lanczos diagonalization .",
    "the former constitutes a landau level projection , an approximation that is valid at the high magnetic field regime.@xcite    the single - particle wave functions in oscillator units read @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the non - trivial quantities are the interaction matrix elements @xmath16 . utilizing the angular momentum conservation @xmath17 ,",
    "these can be written in terms of @xmath18 for which a particularly stable analytic formula has been derived by tsiper .",
    "@xcite    the first step in our analysis is to select the tunable parameters and calculate the ground state angular momentum phase diagram . for illustrational reasons , we content ourselves to two continuous parameters , the magnetic field @xmath19 and the position of the potential barrier @xmath7 . by application of the following scaling trick , which corresponds to curvilinear representation of the tunable parameters ,",
    "the number of lanczos diagonalizations needed to compute a phase diagram can be greatly reduced .    up to a constant shift , the energy @xmath20 of the ground state @xmath21 of the ring - dot system for a fixed total angular momentum @xmath22 reads @xmath23\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the effective bohr radius , @xmath25 in units of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in units of @xmath28 .",
    "hence , we find it convenient to scale the strength of the potential barrier as @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ alpha0 ] ) with a dimensionless potential barrier strength parameter @xmath30 , fixed for a given phase diagram .",
    "the ground state phase diagram is then efficiently computed by performing the exact diagonalization at each angular momentum value at each position ( in units of @xmath31 ) of the barrier , after which the magnetic field dependence of the energies can be easily obtained without need for doing the diagonalization at each magnetic field value . after the angular momenta of adjacent phases",
    "are determined , the exact value of the magnetic field @xmath19 at the boundary is solved from an algebraic equation .",
    "this also means that the wave functions in a given phase remain the same except for scaling of @xmath31 as we move in the @xmath19-direction . as the energy differences of the single - particle states scale roughly as @xmath32 at high magnetic fields , the effect of the barrier",
    "is expected , despite the decrease of @xmath8 , to slightly increase with increasing magnetic field .     with the magnetic field for @xmath33 .",
    "in the following , we consider the ground states of ring - dot systems with weak and strong coupling as a function of the magnetic field @xmath19 and the position of the potential barrier @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams in the case of @xmath34 electrons are shown in fig .",
    "[ faasit](a ) for a weak coupling @xmath33 and fig .",
    "[ faasit](b ) for a stronger coupling @xmath35 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath22 increases as the magnetic field gets stronger and most of the phases belong to a regular diamond structure that is explained below .         in the @xmath36 branch of fig . [",
    "faasit](a ) . ]    in both diagrams , the bottom phase corresponds to the minimum angular momentum of the maximum density droplet , in which the @xmath1 lowest angular momentum orbitals are compactly occupied .",
    "the wave function is the same as for the integer quantum hall effect filling fraction @xmath37 @xmath38 with angular momentum @xmath39 .    at higher angular momenta above @xmath37 , the potential barrier leads to the partition of the phase diagram according to the number of electrons @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the inner electron droplet , or equivalently @xmath42 in the outer . at small @xmath7 , when the @xmath43-function potential is close to the center of the external parabolic confinement potential , the density at the center vanishes and the electrons form a ring - like structure .",
    "when @xmath7 is increased by moving the potential barrier farther away from the origin , electrons tunnel into the quantum dot at the center of the system one by one . finally , all electrons are in the dot , and the barrier only compresses the system giving rise to a reduced radius of the electron density by shifting the ground state transitions to higher magnetic fields and reorganizing the electron configuration .",
    "we start the detailed analysis of the phase diagrams from this regime .",
    "we first analyse the system following lines a and b of fig .",
    "[ faasit](a ) .",
    "the corresponding angular momenta are shown in fig .",
    "[ outgang ] .",
    "as the magnetic field gets stronger , the successive phases tend to have angular momentum difference six ( a ) or five ( b ) , as the electrons favour either a hexagonal configuration or a pentagonal configuration with one electron at the center.@xcite two exceptions are the small @xmath44 phase along line a and the @xmath45 phase along line b , which corresponds to a @xmath37 state with a hole at the center .",
    "the pentagonal phases have slightly larger radius than the corresponding phases that support hexagonal electron configurations so that the compression eventually favours the hexagonal configuation and counter - intuitively actually reduces the density near the center .",
    "a notable exception is the strong yellow ( lightest gray ) phase continuously connected to the laughlin state at filling fraction @xmath46 with the wave function @xmath47 and angular momentum @xmath48 that supports both the pentagonal and hexagonal electron configurations .",
    "let us now analyze more carefully each branch in the weak coupling phase diagram .",
    "for this purpose , we define the angular momentum of the dot as @xmath49 , where the sum is taken up to such @xmath50 that @xmath51 . if this orbital is shared between the ring and the dot , only the corresponding fraction of @xmath52 is employed in place of @xmath52 .",
    "the angular momentum of the ring is then obtained from the total angular momentum as @xmath53 .",
    "note that in the coupled system @xmath54 and @xmath55 are in general not exact integers since the wave function typically contains superpositions of the two systems with different angular momenta summing to a given total angular momentum .    figs .",
    "[ weakang](a - f ) show @xmath22 and @xmath54 as a function of @xmath19 along lines of constant @xmath7 chosen from branches @xmath56 to @xmath57 of the phase diagram .",
    "the corresponding occupation numbers for each ground - state angular momentum at the first magnetic field value on each plateau are listed in figs .",
    "[ weakang](g - l ) , where number of electrons in the dot @xmath58 run from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .        in figs .",

    "next in figs .",
    "[ weakang](b ) and ( h ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 so that one electron occupies the @xmath64 orbital and the remaining five electrons are in the ring .",
    "[ weakang](c ) and ( i ) tell similar story , where now two first orbitals are occupied while the remaining 4 electrons are in the ring yielding @xmath65 and @xmath66 . at about 6.5 t",
    ", there is a transition in the inner system as two electrons at the center excite to @xmath67 and @xmath68 giving @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ weakang](d ) and ( j ) , there are two such transitions as @xmath70 is first 3 , then it increases to 6 and finally to 9 . in figs .",
    "[ weakang](e , k ) and ( f , l ) , we have similarly the frequent excitations of the ring with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , and the less frequent excitations of the dot with @xmath65 and @xmath60 , respectively . in the occupation numbers ( figs .",
    "[ weakang](g - l ) ) , these transition are seen such that subsequent states differ either by the inner or outer ( or both ) system moving one unit to the right .",
    "we thus see that for @xmath73 the premier mechanism for gaining angular momentum is to periodically give the incremental angular momentum to the electrons of the exterior ring , which leads to the angular momentum difference @xmath74 for successive phases .",
    "the magnetic field range of each phase is then roughly a constant .",
    "the subsidiary mechanism is to increase the angular momentum of the inner system , which typically involves creation of a vortex near the center . in this case",
    ", the angular momentum shift is around @xmath1 depending on whether all or merely the inner electrons move radially outwards",
    ".    the transfer of electrons in and out of the quantum ring should be observable in the aharonov - bohm magnetic period.@xcite we also expect the creation of vortices in the electron droplet to be observable in the conductivity in analogy with findings of ref .",
    "for concentric quantum rings .",
    "in fact , by comparing the discs defined by the radius of density maximum in the quantum dot between the vertical dashed red lines in fig .",
    "[ weakang ] , we found that the area of the disc increased approximately by one in oscillator units at each transition , which in the limit @xmath75 corresponds to one magnetic flux quantum .",
    "similar behaviour is observed for the area enclosed by the density maximum of the ring .",
    "the regular diamond structure in fig . [ faasit](a ) is due to the symmetry blockade caused by the fact that the transfer of charge in and out of the droplet constitutes an immense change in the angular momentum as a large number of radially localized angular momentum orbitals fit in the space between the ring and the dot .",
    "we remark that the phases tend to get thinner in @xmath7 direction as we move to larger @xmath7 because the same amount of angular momentum orbitals become available for a smaller increase of @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the radial size of the orbital with quantum number @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath76 rather than @xmath50 .",
    "the small phases near @xmath77 , more visible for the weaker barrier in fig .",
    "[ faasit](b ) , are due to the fact that a normal parabolic quantum dot with six electrons supports the pentagonal electron configurations except at @xmath45 and @xmath78.@xcite since the influence of the potential is proportional to its perimeter , at sufficiently small @xmath7 the potential can no longer force the hexagonal configuration , and the ground - state angular momenta of a parabolic quantum dot , found also at the limit @xmath79 , are reacquired .",
    "recall the ground state angular momentum phase diagram for @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "[ faasit](b ) . as the strength of the barrier @xmath30",
    "is weakened , the regular structure of the phase diagram present at a strong barrier strength is gradually lost as the coupling between the inner and outer system becomes larger and a more unilateral collective behaviour extends over the barrier . due to scaling of the energies with the magnetic field as mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , the coherent structure fails first at weak magnetic fields .",
    "[ strongang](a - f ) show @xmath22 and @xmath54 as a function of @xmath19 along lines of constant @xmath7 chosen from branches @xmath56 to @xmath57 of the phase diagram with the occupation numbers at each plateau listed in figs .",
    "[ strongang](g - l ) .",
    "[ strongang](a , g ) and ( b , h ) admit to the explanation of hexagonal and pentagonal electron configurations with 0 and 1 electron at the center as previously . at strong magnetic fields , figs .",
    "[ strongang](c - f ) and ( i - l ) are reminiscent of the weak coupling case with excitations of the dot and the angular momentum of the ring increasing in definite steps . in the higher angular momentum states ,",
    "the separation into two systems is evident in the occupation numbers .",
    "main difference to the strong barrier case is the spreading of the angular momentum reflecting the strong coupling of the systems , best seen in fig .",
    "[ strongang](l ) . however , at weak magnetic fields the ring angular momentum is no longer constant suggesting that our simple picture breaks down due to the electron correlations .",
    "this is seen on the first few lines of the corresponding occupations in figs .",
    "[ strongang](j - l ) where the electrons appear to be either in the dot or an excited dot .    in fig .",
    "[ strongang](i ) , the three small phases crossed by @xmath80 nm in fig .  [ faasit](b ) still have large weight on the two first orbitals corresponding to 2 electrons at the center and the quantity @xmath81 , where @xmath52 is the occupation of angular momentum orbital @xmath50 , is exceedingly close to 1,2 , and 3 , respectively , demonstrating quantized charge depletion relative to the @xmath37 maximum density droplet .",
    "for the phases directly above @xmath37 , the charge depletion is one electron charge to an accuracy of 1 .",
    "even when all the electrons are inside the barrier , the compression still affects the edge details of the system .",
    "a quantity of interest for the tunnelling experiments that probe the chiral luttinger liquid theory of the fqh edge in macroscopic samples is the current - voltage power - law dependence @xmath82 , and hence ( in the thermodynamic limit ) the power - law dependence of the edge green s function @xcite @xmath83 which is called the edge green s function as it is evaluated along the edge . for an electron disc",
    ", we may set @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is about the radius of the disc . according to the theory @xmath87 , where @xmath88 reflects the topological order of the fqh phase .",
    "the experimental results are somewhat puzzling in that while there appears to be a clear non - ohmic current - voltage power - law dependence @xmath82 in accordance with the chiral luttinger liquid theory of the fqh edge @xcite , the exact value of the tunnelling exponent @xmath88 appears to be sample dependent and in general notably less than the supposed universal value derived from the bulk effective theory .",
    "a number of mechanisms , including taking into account the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction and edge reconstruction , whose effect amounts to renormalization of the power - law exponent @xmath88 , have been suggested by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , no clear consensus of the correct picture has been achieved so far .    for the @xmath46 phase ,",
    "in which it is possible to continuously interpolate the superposition of the hexagonal and pentagonal electron configurations , the tunnelling exponent @xmath88 decreases continuously as the compression is increased .",
    "this result is in agreement with the findings of ref .  , where with a slightly different confinement potential and 8 electrons the exponent @xmath88 was found to change after cutting the size of the single - particle basis .",
    "[ greenfff ] illustrates the determination of the power - law exponent @xmath88 .",
    "the oscillations are seen to vanish as the edge is approached and the exponents @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be credibly extracted . however",
