    "many fundamental questions regarding nuclear and hadron structures and dynamics originate from the nonperturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the basis light - front quantization ( blfq )  @xcite was constructed with the goal of providing a first - principles nonperturbative solution to qcd .",
    "so far the development of blfq has been carried out in two branches , focusing on the time - dependent and time - independent applications , respectively .",
    "for the former , we recently constructed the `` time - dependent '' blfq ( tblfq )  @xcite .",
    "this method aims to simulate and study the dynamics of quantum field evolution , such as the scattering processes with or without a time - dependent background field . in this article , we , however , limit our focus to the time - independent regime and specifically discuss the application of blfq to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we explain the basic formalism of blfq ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : singlee ] we review its application to the single electron system in qed ; in sec .  [ sec : positronium ] we discuss the application to the positronium system and present preliminary numerical results .",

    "in this section we briefly review the main aspects of blfq , see refs .",

    "basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) , as a nonperturbative approach to quantum field theory , adopts the light - front dynamics  @xcite and hamiltonian formalism .",
    "it solves the quantum field system through the eigenvalue problem of the associated light - front hamiltonian , @xmath0 , as , @xmath1 upon solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) , one obtains the invariant mass spectrum of the quantum field system through the eigenvalues @xmath2 .",
    "the associated light - front amplitudes , @xmath3 , can be employed to evaluate observables characterizing the structure of these mass eigenstates .    in order to cast eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) into matrix form and solve it numerically , we need to construct a basis for the quantum field system . in blfq",
    ", we construct the basis in terms of the fock - space expansion . for each fock - state particle , we employ a 2d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis to represent its transverse degrees of freedom and a plane - wave basis in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the 2d - ho basis contains a scale parameter @xmath4 , corresponding to the classical amplitude of the ground state ho .",
    "the basis functions adopted in blfq are closely related to the eigensolutions of the phenomenologically successful light - front holography approach to qcd  @xcite .",
    "next we truncate the basis to make the numerical calculations practical .",
    "basis truncation is performed both on the fock - sector level and inside each fock sector . inside each fock sector",
    "the truncations are implemented independently for the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom .    in the transverse directions we tally the total 2d - ho quantum number in each basis state by @xmath5 , over all the fock particles in the basis state .",
    "the @xmath6(@xmath7 ) is the radial ( angular ) quantum number for particle @xmath8 .",
    "then we truncate those whose @xmath9 exceeds a chosen upper limit @xmath10 .    in the longitudinal direction we compactify the system in a box by imposing the ( anti)periodic boundary condition for ( fermions ) bosons .",
    "as a result , the longitudinal momentum of ( fermions ) bosons can take only positive ( half-)integer values ( in the unit of inverse box length ) and we neglect the zero mode for the bosons . taking into account of",
    "the fact that the total longitudinal momentum of the system , denoted as @xmath11 , is a conserved quantity , @xmath11 effectively works as a truncation parameter . in blfq",
    "it is customary to use @xmath11 as a dimensionless number , representing the longitudinal momentum in the unit of inverse box length .",
    "larger @xmath10 and @xmath11 result in larger bases , which not only have greater coverage on both the ultraviolet and infrared ends , but also are able to represent finer details of the represented quantum field systems .",
    "these truncations typically break the gauge symmetry in a gauge theory , which leads to difficulties in renormalization .",
    "in fact these difficulties have long been known as a standing issue in nonperturbative hamiltonian - based approaches with fock - sector truncation , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore ,",
    "one of the central tasks in blfq is to explore prospective renormalization procedures which render converging and meaningful results for the observables .",
    "although the ultimate goal of blfq is to address bound state problems in qcd , this method can also be applied to other theories . in order to advance the techniques",
    ", we apply blfq to qed as an initial step .",
    "below we report our recent work on the single electron and the positronium system in sequence .",
    "the simplest system in qed is a single physical electron .",
    "we begin by solving this system in a truncated basis with only @xmath12 and @xmath13 fock sectors .",
    "after factorizing out the center - of - mass motion , one can show that in the @xmath12 sector the light - front amplitude of the physical electron state involves only one basis state , with both the radial , @xmath14 , and angular quantum number , @xmath15 , being zero .",
    "due to the quantum fluctuation to the states in the @xmath13 sector , this state receives self - energy corrections . according to the sector - dependent renormalization procedure  @xcite",
    ", we apply a mass counterterm @xmath16 to this state and only to this state . specifically , we replace the mass term @xmath17 from the kinetic energy term by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the longitudinal momentum of this state .",
    "we then evaluate the invariant mass @xmath20 of the resulting ground state ( identified as the physical electron state @xmath21 ) through @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the total longitudinal ( transverse ) momentum operator .",
    "next we iteratively adjust the value of @xmath16 until the resulting invariant mass matches the physical electron mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20=0.511mev .",
    "if we calculate observables from the resulting light - front amplitudes , the mass renormalization alone turns out to be insufficient .",
    "for example , we encountered problems when we tried to evaluate the anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "we found that the naive result vanishes in the limit of @xmath24 and @xmath11 approaching infinity , which suggests that the norm of the naive amplitude from diagonalization is incorrect .",
    "we attributed this artifact to the violation the ward - identity caused by fock - sector truncation .",
    "we solved this problem by proposing an _ ad - hoc _ rescaling  @xcite on the direct ( naive ) amplitude from diagonalization ( da ) and then evaluating observables using the rescaled amplitude ( ra ) .",
    "the ra is in general subdivided into a `` positive(p)-component '' and an `` negative(n)-component '' . here",
    "`` positive '' and `` negative '' are named after the sign in front of each component when they appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : res_norm ] ) below .",
    "let us denote da in the single electron problem as @xmath25 , the p - component of ra as @xmath26 and the n - component as @xmath27 .",
    "now we recapitulate the rescaling procedure and its motivation .",
    "this rescaling procedure is motivated through a diagrammatic analysis of da , which is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : da ] .    in our current truncation level",
    ", the da in the @xmath13 sector only receives external leg corrections _ before _ the photon emission . neither the vertex corrections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : truncated_vertex ] ) nor the external leg corrections _",
    "after _ the photon emission ( fig .  [ fig : truncated_self ] ) exist , since these two would require basis states in the @xmath28 sector .",
    "this mismatch of the diagrams causes the violation of the condition @xmath29=@xmath30 as required by the ward identity  @xcite , where @xmath29 , the vertex correction factor , remains one whereas @xmath30 , the wavefunction renormalization factor , is less than one due to the self - energy corrections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blob ] ) .",
    "our tentative solution is to restore the condition @xmath31 by dividing out the external leg corrections from da , which can be read out from the @xmath12 sector contribution to da ( fig .",
    "[ fig : da_e_dressed ] ) . the resulting rescaled amplitude ( ra )",
    "is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaling ] .",
    "following this idea we first read out the wavefunction renormalization factor , @xmath32 , from the projection of da onto the sole contributing basis state in the @xmath12 sector .",
    "this quantity carries the interpretation of the probability of finding a bare electron out of a physical electron .",
    "then we rescale da by @xmath33 and obtain the p - component of ra , @xmath34    in order to maintain the overall norm of ra being one , we introduce the n - component with its norm being negative .",
    "based on the observation from perturbation theory  @xcite , we hypothesize that in our current truncation level ( with the @xmath13 sector as the highest fock sector ) the n - component is contributed solely by the @xmath12 sector .",
    "we then fix the norm of the n - component from the requirement that the overall norm of ra is one , namely , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the projection operator onto the @xmath12 sector .",
    "it is easy to check that the _ difference _ between the squared norm of the p- and n - components is unity ( assuming @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 we use the above line of reasoning to suggest that observables @xmath39 can be evaluated by sandwiching the pertinent operator @xmath40 with ra according to , @xmath41    based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : eval_observ ] ) we evaluated the electron anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite and the generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) for the electron  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results are comparable with those from perturbation theory at the expected precision .",
    "the agreement on gpds holds at various @xmath42 ( the longitudinal momentum fraction of the constituent bare electron ) and for different momentum transfer @xmath43 , which suggests that the renormalization prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eval_observ ] ) is consistent with perturbative renormalization at a rather differential level .",
    "we will later apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : eval_observ ] ) to the hamiltonian when we evaluate the positronium energy spectrum .",
    "now we proceed to the positronium system , a bound state system formed by an electron @xmath44 and a positron @xmath45 . in the previous work we have solved this system by using an effective interaction acting only in the @xmath46 sector  @xcite .",
    "now we try to solve this system in qed in a basis consisting of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 two fock sectors .",
    "following the `` gauge cutoff '' procedure  @xcite , we include the instantaneous photon interactions only in the @xmath46 fock sector .",
    "we ignore the instantaneous fermion interactions for simplicity .",
    "since the positronium is not an elementary particle , we expect that the required normalization factors should be extracted from the single electron system .",
    "in contrast to the single electron system , the light - front amplitude of the positronium receives contributions from multiple basis states in the leading ( @xmath46 ) fock sector .",
    "each of them is able to receive self - energy corrections through coupling to the @xmath47 fock sector .",
    "the basis states in the @xmath47 sector are truncated at a fixed @xmath10 for different fock sectors , namely @xmath48 for the @xmath46 sector and @xmath49 for the @xmath47 sector , see below . within each fock sector",
    "the basis states are truncated at a uniform @xmath10 ( and @xmath11 ) . ] and @xmath11 , whereas each basis state in the @xmath46 sector carries distinct ( longitudinal or transverse ) quantum numbers .",
    "hence the  phase space \" , or , the ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs , for the self - energy corrections is different for each individual basis state in the @xmath46 sector . as a result ,",
    "each basis state in the @xmath46 sector receives a different self - energy correction . taking this into account we propose a _",
    "basis - state _ dependent renormalization procedure , where distinct renormalization factors ( @xmath50 and @xmath30 ) are applied to each individual basis state .    in order to determine @xmath50 and @xmath30 ( basis ) state by ( basis ) state",
    ", we construct a distinct  embedded single electron \" ( ese ) system for each basis state in the @xmath46 sector .",
    "similar to the positronium system , the ese systems span two fock sectors : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the @xmath46 sector",
    "we place only one distinct basis state .",
    "this basis state consists of one dynamic particle , _",
    "e.g. _ , the electron , and one spectator , _",
    "e.g. _ , the positron .",
    "the photon is allowed to be coupled only to the dynamic particle , but not the spectator .",
    "the role of the spectator is to make the kinematics of the self - energy correction for the dynamic particle match that in the positronium system , so that the inferred renormalization quantities can subsequently be used in the fully interacting positronium system . before proceeding further ,",
    "let us briefly recapitulate the assumptions behind the basis - state dependent renormalization procedure and the ese systems : ( i ) different basis states may be associated with distinct renormalization factors ( @xmath50 and @xmath30 ) ; ( ii ) the renormalization factors for each specific basis state depend on the phase space ( in the higher fock sectors ) available for the self - energy corrections , which varies from basis state to basis state due to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the fact that the phase space allowed by the truncation parameters in the higher fock sectors ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the @xmath47 sector ) could be occupied by the spectator particle .",
    "for example , different spectator particles take up different longitudinal momenta from the total @xmath11 ; ( iii ) the renormalization factors for each constituent particle do not depend on the physical systems in which this particle resides .",
    "for example , the same renormalization parameters should be applied to a bare electron whether it appears in a free physical electron or as a constituent of a positronium state , as long as the available phase space for the self - energy correction is the same in both cases .    by solving these ese systems",
    ", we obtain the @xmath50 and @xmath30 for each basis state and then use them to renormalize the positronium system .",
    "we first perform mass renormalization by applying each distinct @xmath50 into the corresponding kinetic energy term in the positronium system . upon diagonalization of the hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain the direct amplitude ( da ) for the positronium state @xmath51 , which we denote as @xmath52 .",
    "next we perform wavefunction rescaling .",
    "we first rescale da and obtain the p - component of ra , @xmath53 , in the @xmath46 sector .",
    "specifically , we rescale the projection of da onto each individual basis state @xmath3 in the @xmath46 sector with a distinct rescaling factor @xmath54 , @xmath55 the @xmath56 relates to the basis - state dependent @xmath57 ( for the electron ) and @xmath58 ( for the positron ) evaluated in the ese systems according to , @xmath59 the derivation of this relation will be shown in the upcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the @xmath47 sector . unlike the electron problem , here",
    "the photon can be emitted either from @xmath44 or @xmath45 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : positronium_eegamma ] .",
    "therefore it is not straightforward to infer the rescaling factor from the corresponding ones in the @xmath46 sector as in the case of the electron system . to solve this difficulty , as an approximation we introduce an `` averaged '' rescaling factor , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the projection operator onto the @xmath46 sector .",
    "we note that @xmath62 is weighted by the probability of each basis state appearing in the positronium state @xmath51 .",
    "previous study  @xcite suggests that @xmath63 diverges logarithmically as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "if this holds true , in the limit of @xmath65 we expect that nearly all the basis states @xmath3 have roughly equal @xmath56 and thus the approximation becomes very good and @xmath45 like \\{1/2 , k-1/2 } , or with very large ( comparable with @xmath10 ) ho quantum numbers in the transverse directions , may still have distinct @xmath56 factors . however , these states are not expected to take appreciable probability in well - behaved low - lying positronium states . ] .",
    "the quality of this approximation will be further studied in the upcoming paper  @xcite .    with @xmath62",
    "we rescale da in the @xmath47 sector as a whole and obtain the p - component of ra in the @xmath47 sector , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the projection operator onto the @xmath47 sector . now",
    "the norm of @xmath68 is @xmath69 ( assuming @xmath70 ) .",
    "next , we introduce the n - component of ra , which we take from the @xmath46 sector of the p - component and renormalize it with the norm of @xmath71 , @xmath72 thus the _ difference _ between the squared norm of the p- and n - components of ra is unity along the lines of eq .",
