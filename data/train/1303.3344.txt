    "networks of dynamical units have been used to model everything from earthquakes to ecosystems , neurons to financial market @xcite . studying the impact of complex network topology @xcite on the dynamical processes is of fundamental importance for understanding the functioning of these real world systems .",
    "synchronization is one of the most fascinating phenomenon exhibited by such nonlinear dynamical units interacting with each other @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been intensively investigated as a universal concept in many disciplines , particularly in neuro - sciences @xcite and communication @xcite .",
    "recently synchronization has been shown to play a crucial role in the species extinction @xcite .",
    "keeping such applications in mind , a great deal of work is devoted to build up the strategies for the network connection architecture which could synchronize the dynamical units on them @xcite .",
    "most of these works have considered global synchronized states spanning all nodes in a network .    in the past years",
    "focus of coupled dynamics research got shifted to the ( phase ) synchronized clusters @xcite or dynamical clusters instead of a global synchronized state .",
    "dynamical clusters are defined based on some kind of coherent time evolution of some units which is different than the evolution of other units .",
    "dynamical clusters have been the part of coupled dynamics research since the seminal work of kuramoto which mainly focused on the transition to the global synchronized state @xcite . before the transition , @xcite reports the phase - synchronized clusters , where clusters are distinguished based on the frequencies of dynamical units .",
    "kaneko s coupled maps model also talks about the glassy phase where nodes are partially synchronized @xcite .",
    "kuramoto s coupled oscillator and kaneko s coupled maps models assumed either nearest neighbor connections or all to all connections between the nodes . later on with the spurt of complex network research , these types of coupled dynamics models had been investigated with units having local and nonlocal connections , and also show partial synchronized state with dynamical clusters @xcite .",
    "these works mainly concentrated on the finding of partial synchronized state , and did not pay much attention to the coupling configurations .",
    "however , networks modeling real world , have some structures , hence it was very natural to imagine a relation between the connection architecture and the dynamical clusters .",
    "it could be rephrased as follows : do connections in the dynamical clusters have some specific features ?",
    "manrubia and mikhalov in @xcite found that the connections in dynamical clusters do have some particular configuration , i.e. elements from a cluster generally having more connections inside the cluster than with the elements from other dynamical clusters .",
    "though this was a very significant observation and more importantly presented the concept of relation between dynamical cluster and the underlying network , their observation was based on the dynamical units coupled with some particular coupling strength and having random coupling architecture .",
    "the detailed investigations of coupled dynamics on various networks , done by jalan and amritkar @xcite , revealed that there exists two different mechanisms of the formation of the dynamical clusters ; ( a ) self - organized clusters where couplings are intra - cluster type , ( b ) driven - synchronized where coupling are inter - cluster type .",
    "the main result of the ref.@xcite is that the coupled dynamical units may get synchronized because of inter - cluster or intra- cluster couplings .",
    "whereas self - organized mechanism has more commonly been thought as a reason of synchronization from seminal work by kaneko @xcite to recent work by several scientists @xcite , @xcite identified a new mechanism of cluster formation that is driven synchronization and did extensive studies of the two mechanisms of cluster formation for various networks @xcite .",
    "recently self and driven - synchronization has been investigated in the relevance of brain cortical networks @xcite .",
    "real world networks have community or module structure @xcite , where modules are the division of network nodes into various groups within which the network connections are dense , but between which they are sparser .",
    "the modularity concepts assumes that system functionality can be partitioned into a collection of modules and each module is a discrete entity of several components performing an identifiable task , separable from the functions of other modules @xcite . in the light of this finding the concept of relation between dynamical clusters and the network architecture @xcite can be rephrased ; do dynamical clusters reveal organization or module structure of the underlying network , and what functional clusters would be preferred for a given network architecture ?",
    "investigation in this direction @xcite showed that the dynamical units reveal the hierarchical organization of the synchronization behavior with respect to the collective dynamics of the network . furthermore zhou et .",
    "used synchronized clusters to unveil the functional connectivity in the complex brain networks @xcite .",
    "these works exploited the synchronous behavior of dynamical units to detect the hierarchical organization , on the other hand m. timme concentrated on the disordered state to understand the relation between dynamical behavior and the network topology @xcite .",
    "recently phenomenon of driven synchronization is observed for three stochastic oscillators which are coupled with delay @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we highlight that there is a great difference in the process leading to the synchronization and synchronized cluster state , depending upon the particular coupling configuration .",
    "we show that these two ways of the construction of the dynamical clusters depend highly on the underlying network architecture .",
    "self - organized clusters are formed for the networks whose network architecture is such that it can clearly be divided into different sub - communities , whereas for the bi - partite networks driven clusters are formed .",
    "mixed clusters , i.e. some are self - organized and some are driven organized , are formed for the network architecture which lie in the middle of these two extreme ideal network structure .",
    "we use lyapunov function to understand the origin of these two types of clusters .",

    "<S> smaller coupling strength region shows driven clusters independent of the network rewiring strategies , where as larger coupling strength region shows the transition from the self - organized cluster to the driven cluster as network connections are rewired to the bi - partite type . </S>",
