    "<S> because of its relevance , this situation has been considered in many recent hydromechanical studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> laboratory tests report that the shearing process results in a significant channelization of the flow and an enhancement of the permeability in the direction normal to the shear . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is found to be related to the long - range spatial organization of the void space , and efforts have been undertaken to modelize such system in order to provide upscaled value for the fracture permeability . </S>",

    "<S> we present in this note a computational method for calculating the permeability of such fracture faults even in the presence of contacts . </S>",
    "<S> this new method scales linearly with the number of grid points and is more than two orders of magnitude faster than solving the finite - differenced reynolds equations through lu decomposition .    </S>",
    "<S> there is now ample experimental and observational evidence that fracture surfaces are self affine , see e.g. , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a self - affine fracture may characterized by a rescaling @xmath7 of distances in the average fracture plane and a rescaling @xmath8 of distances in the orthogonal direction leaves the statistical properties of the surface unchanged . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the hurst exponent . </S>",
    "<S> we use in the following @xmath1 , i.e.  the value often reported for rocks fractures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the two matching fracture surfaces are displaced by a distance @xmath10 along the average fracture plane , the ensuing aperture field will be self - affine up to the length scales of the order of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> on larger scales , the aperture field settles to a constant value proportional to the average fracture opening @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a aperture field @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> as the two fracture surfaces approach each other , they will eventually come into contact and hence overlap . </S>",
    "<S> overlap also occurs if the gap between the two fracture surfaces remains fixed while the lateral displacement @xmath10 increases . at such places of contact , we set the aperture @xmath12 to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the contact areas are shown as white in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lateral displacement results in a strong structural anisotropy : the contact zones are more elongated in the direction normal to the displacement ( @xmath13 direction with reference to fig .  [ fig1 ] ) than in the other direction ( @xmath14 direction with reference to fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind the method we introduce in this note is based on the generalization of the concept of the bottle neck to higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> some forty years ago , @xcite presented a different generalization of the same concept . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , only in a limiting case do the two generalizations approach each other .    before delving into the two - dimensional generalization </S>",
    "<S>  and hence the method we present  we discuss the one - dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> hence we have a channel with self - affine walls that have been translated relative to each other along the direction of the channel by a distance @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the channel aperture is given by @xmath15 , where the @xmath14 axis is oriented along the channel . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the reynolds equations govern the flow in the channel , the local permeability is proportional to @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the permeability of the entire channel is then given by the harmonic mean of the local permeability , i.e. , @xmath17 @xcite . if we now assume that the two channel walls are brought close together ( so that @xmath18 decreases ) , the permeability is increasingly controlled by the region of minimum aperture @xmath19 @xcite , which may be then viewed as a bottle neck .    how wide , @xmath20 , is the bottle neck region ? </S>",
    "<S> this of course depends on the geometry of the two channel walls in this region . for the time being , we leave @xmath20 as a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we now divide the entire channel along the @xmath14 axis into two regions : the bottle neck region which has a width @xmath20 and the rest which has a width @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the length of the entire channel . </S>",
    "<S> the bottle neck region have a permeability essentially given by @xmath23 and the rest of the channel will have a permeability that is essentially @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the total permeability of the channel @xmath25 may then be approximated by @xmath26 given by @xmath27 clearly , @xmath20 will evolve as the average channel width @xmath18 decreases and keeping it constant will constitute an approximation . </S>",
    "<S> how good is such an approximation ? </S>",
    "<S> a natural choice for a fixed @xmath20 may e.g.  be the discretization length scale ( i.e. , the lattice constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath18 decreases , the more dominant the bottle neck region will be and the more sensitive @xmath26 will be to the discretization at this point . </S>",
    "<S> approximations are unavoidable as the average channel width decreases . </S>",
    "<S> a  natural \" choice as the discretization length itself breaks down when the discretization itself breaks down .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to generalizing this discussion to two - dimensional aperture fields @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the one - dimensional channel and the two - dimensional fracture is that flow can in the latter case easily bypass regions of small aperture . </S>",
    "<S> they do not play the crucial role here as they did in the one - dimensional channel .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore generalize the concept of the bottle neck for two - dimensional fractures . as a first step to this generalization </S>",
    "<S> , we consider paths going from one side of the fracture to the opposite side cutting across the average flow direction . as a result of mass conservation </S>",
    "<S> , the flow has to pass through all such paths . for each transverse path @xmath28 with respect to the flow direction ( here , the @xmath14 direction ) </S>",
    "<S> , we may calculate the average aperture cubed along it , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the length of the path and @xmath31 is the unit vector in the @xmath13 direction . </S>",
    "<S> this average now replaces for the two dimensional system , the local permeability @xmath32 for the channel in one dimension .    in the one - dimensional channel we then went on to identifying the smallest local permeability @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> this was the bottle neck . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> we now search for the _ path with the smallest average aperture cubed , _ henceforth refered to as the _ worst path , _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows for one of the realizations the two worst paths obtained for flow directions along and normal to the lateral displacement .    </S>",
    "<S> using the same reasoning as in one dimension , we may now generalize eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ totalperm - x ] ) by replacing @xmath19 by @xmath35 , hence @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the width of the fracture in the @xmath13 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> when the average flow is in the @xmath13 direction rather than the @xmath14 direction , there is of course an equivalent expression for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these two expressions , for @xmath26 and @xmath38 , form the core of our method for approximating the permeability of fracture faults .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss briefly the relation between the worst path method and the ambegaokar - halperin - langer estimate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ahl estimate is based on the idea that when the local permeability is very widely distributed , the upscaled permeability is controlled by the smallest local permeability along the path connecting the inlet to the outlet that has the highest average permeability along it . if in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ effh3 ] ) , we assume that @xmath39 is so widely distributed that the integral is dominated by the _ </S>",
    "<S> largest value _ of @xmath39 along the path , the integral becomes @xmath40 if we now combine this expression with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ smallesth3 ] ) to estimate the permeability of the bottle neck region , we find @xmath41\\;.\\ ] ] this expression is essentially the ambegaokar - halperin - langer expression for the permeability , except that we in this limit end up with the maximum permeability along the path with the minimum permeability along it , whereas in the analysis of @xcite ,  min \" and  max \" have been substituted . in two - dimensional systems , </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> hence , only in the limit of extremely broad aperture distributions , is our formulation equivalent to that of @xcite .    as in one dimension </S>",
    "<S> , the width of the bottle neck region , @xmath20 , is a parameter depending on the local topography near the worst path . </S>",
    "<S> it needs to the determined independently . </S>",
    "<S> one way to estimate it is to equate @xmath26 ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 ) , gotten from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ totalperm ] ) , with the permeability gotten from another method when the fracture opening is large : the detail of the procedure is described farther in the text . as in one dimension </S>",
    "<S> , we expect @xmath20 to change as the average fracture aperture , @xmath42 is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that it is a constant  as we will do  constitutes an approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> given the aperture fields , we compared their permeabilities found using eq.([totalperm ] ) with the results of two other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the first one , proposed by @xcite , is based on a stochastic continuum theory applied to a first order perturbation expansion of the darcy s law . </S>",
    "<S> we compute numerically the fourier transform of the permeability field perturbation @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the two component of the effective permeability are then calculated from the integrals @xmath44 and @xmath45 since this is only a second order expansion , these results are expected to be valid only for small permeability fluctuations , i.e. , when the fracture opening @xmath46 is large compared to the height fluctuations in the fracture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second method consists in solving the flow field inside the permeability field by using a lattice boltzmann method . in the this scheme , we introduce a body force to produce a darcy - brinkman equation as described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we decrease the brinkman term so that it has no appreciable effect on the permeability . </S>",
    "<S> when the two surfaces are in contact , the lattice site is set to be solid by using the `` bounce - back '' reflection method for the density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a pressure - imposed boundary condition is used at the inlet and outlet as described by @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> practically , we identify the worst path and the corresponding integral , eq.([smallesth3 ] ) by using a transfer matrix algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the average flow direction is in the @xmath14 direction , the path we construct runs between the sides of the sample parallel to the @xmath13 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we discretize the aperture field @xmath47 , onto a square lattice where @xmath48 runs from 1 to @xmath49 and @xmath50 from 1 to @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a second field @xmath53 which initially is set to zero everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> we then update layer by layer in the @xmath48 direction @xmath54+h(i+1,j)^3\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] until @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the integral eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ smallesth3 ] ) is then given by @xmath56 where we designate by @xmath57 the @xmath50 value where the mininum @xmath58 was identified . in order to reconstruct the worst path , we start at the position @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we then move on the next layer , and identify @xmath60 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath50 value that corresponds to the minimum at level @xmath55 is designated @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> this may be generalized to @xmath76 . in our numerical calculations presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we have used @xmath77 . however , we see no appreciable difference between this value and @xmath78 .    the algorithm described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ layer ] ) assumes that the paths do not turn back , i.e. , @xmath79 . in very strongly disordered fractures , </S>",
    "<S> such turns may play a role . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for the fractures studied here . </S>",
    "<S> however , when turns do appear , different and more involved algorithms must be used @xcite . whereas the algorithm described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ layer ] ) scales as the number of nodes @xmath80 in the discretized height field , the algorithms capable of handling overhangs scales as @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first study the situation where flow is parallel to the lateral displacement , i.e.  orthogonal to the channelization . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows the variation of the permeability of the fracture estimated by the lattice - boltzmann method ( squares ) and by the second order expansion ( triangles ) as functions of the mean fracture opening and for two lateral displacements . for each of the aperture fields , @xmath82 as well as @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> were measured . </S>",
    "<S> the estimation of @xmath26 still requires an estimation of @xmath20 , see eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we then go on to using _ the same _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 for all subsequent fracture openings . herein lies the major approximation in our method . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as contact areas appear ( here a noticeable difference occurs when contacts cover about @xmath84 of the total fracture area ) , the perturbative estimate @xmath66 fails to describe the continuous drop of the permeability whereas @xmath26 remains very close to @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 as a function of the average fracture aperture @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the data has been averaged over 10 samples , each of size @xmath88 , hurst exponent @xmath89 and lateral displacement @xmath90.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for flow normal to the lateral displacement and , as illustrated in the bottom figure of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we find strong channelization and it is markly different from the one observed when flow is parallel to @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig3 ] shows the permeabilities found by the three methods : a drop off of the permeability with the fracture closure is observed but is less marked than for flow along the shift ( see fig.[fig2 ] for comparison ) . </S>",
    "<S> as previously mentioned , as soon as contacts between the two surfaces occur the pertubative method fails to describe the marked permeability decrease observed with the lattice boltzmann method . </S>",
    "<S> yet the worst path method still accurately captures the permeability reduction estimate in the direction parallel to the channelization even for large lateral displacement of the fracture walls .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , the relative errors between the worst path method and the lattice boltzmann method , and the perturbative approximation and the lattice boltzmann method for different average fracture openings . </S>",
    "<S> the data have been averaged over ten samples . as we see , the worst path method performs very well for all values of the average fracture opening and for the two flow directions .    to conclude , we have introduced a new technique to estimate the permeability of self - affine fracture faults . </S>",
    "<S> compared to other approximative methods , it performs very well by being able to reproduce the permeability closely even when the fracture opening tends to zero .  exact \" methods such as the lattice boltzmann method gives more precise results . </S>",
    "<S> however , the computation time is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to alternative methods . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , solving the finite - differenced reynolds equations through lu decomposition is the fastest  exact method \" . for the samples studied in this note , the worst path method used 0.01 seconds per sample and per average fracture opening , </S>",
    "<S> whereas the lu decomposition used from 3 to 8 seconds . both methods scale linearly with the number of nodes .    </S>",
    "<S> a length scale @xmath20 is introduced in order to fit the permeability measured . </S>",
    "<S> this length characterizes the extension in the flow direction of the region dominated by the worst path . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath20 remains constant as the average fracture opening is changed . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the major approximation build into the method  but it allows us to determine @xmath20 by comparison with other approximate methods such as the perturative scheme for large enough average fracture openings for them to be accurate .    </S>",
    "<S> future work will be devoted to the study the relationship of between @xmath20 and the statistics of the aperture fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the worst path method is accurate even if the aperture field shows structural anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> such situation is achieved by laterally displacing the fracture walls leading , as observed on natural fractures , to an anisotropic permeability field . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method can be further extended to other transport properties such as diffusion or electrical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> different statistical fields such as log normal permeability fields which also give rise to heterogenous flow structures will also be of interest as well as three - dimensional permeability fields . </S>"
