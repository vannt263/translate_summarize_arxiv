    "quenched disorder is obiquitous in condensed - matter systems , sometimes determining entirely new physical properties and phenomena . for the theoretical explanation of many experimental findings ,",
    "models of classical and quantum spin systems are employed and - typically - disorder is introduced through a spatial variation of the exchange couplings , of the direction of the axial anisotropies , and of the sign of the couplings .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of model and real physical systems with these kinds of disorder have lead to much new physics .",
    "much discussed have been the glassy phases in magnetic @xcite , and superconducting materials @xcite .    in superconductors , specially with the advent of high-@xmath0 ceramic superconductors , the role of disorder has become central in the discussion of the physical properties of real materials @xcite .",
    "many materials are naturally microstructured and granularity characterises the mesoscopic structures of most systems , leading to a phase diagram often displaying a superconductor - insulator transition at zero temperature due to the charging energy of the grains .",
    "as first pointed out by abeles @xcite , when the grain charging energy arising from the charge @xmath1 and capacitance @xmath2 of the grain , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the grain diameter and @xmath5 the electronic charge ) is larger than the josephson - coupling energy @xmath6 between nearest neighbors grains , phase coherence is destroyed due to zero - point quantum fluctuations of the local phase of the superconducting order parameter @xcite .",
    "granularity can also be realized in a controlled manner in artificially fabricated josephson - junction arrays of coupled superconducting grains @xcite , with a space dimensionality @xmath4 less than @xmath7 .",
    "such granular systems can be theoretically modelled by pseudo - spin systems , the spins representing with their states the few relevant quantum charge states of the grains at relatively low temperatures . in such models",
    "the pseudo - spin size is the same for all grains corresponding to the assumption that the grain - size distribution is very narrow , or alternatively , of negligible charging - energy disorder .",
    "a well known model of this type is the pseudo - spin - one model introduced by de gennes and studied in different works @xcite where only charge states @xmath8 are allowed , corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "however , realistic systems may contain different kinds of disorder , such as a spatial distribution of josephson couplings between grains or / and a distribution of grain sizes , which leads to disorder in the grain electrical capacitances and charging energies .",
    "studies of the effects of disorder in the electrical capacitance or charging energy of the grains have appeared recently @xcite . within a mean - field approximation @xcite , charging energy disorder widens the extent of the superconducting phase at the expense of the insulating one .",
    "this behavior is consistent with results for the superconductor - insulator transition from quantum monte carlo simulations in two - dimensional models of josephson - junction arrays @xcite with disorder in the diagonal capacitance matrix .",
    "earlier calculations for the related boson hubbard model with disorder in the onsite coulomb repulsion @xcite are also consistent with a decrease in the phase coherence threshold and moreover suggest a different universality class from the non - disordered case @xcite .    in this work , we consider the effects of charging energy disorder in granular superconducting materials within the pseudo - spin approach . by considering a spatial distribution of the grain sizes , which leads to local charging energy disorder , a quantum pseudo - spin model with random on - site spin sizes can be constructed .",
    "a mean - field theory is developed to obtain the phase diagram as a function of temperature , average charging energy and disorder .",
    "spin - size disorder models have seldom been considered in the literature . in the context of classical spin models ,",
    "spin - size disorder can be readily turned into exchange - coupling disorder ; the physics of quantum systems with spin - size disorder , however , appears to have not been investigated in such depths .",
    "it has been considered mostly within the one - dimensional systems : dilution of a quantum spin-@xmath10 2-ladder was studied by sigrist and furusaki @xcite whilst the general problem of a quantum spin chain with random @xmath11 as well as random @xmath12 was considered by westerberg _ et .",
    "@xcite within a real - space renormalization - group method showing that these systems belong to a different universality class of disordered spin systems .",
    "the hamiltonian for a set of superconducting grains coupled by the josephson energy can be written as the sum of the coulomb charging energy and the josephson - coupling energy @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the net charge on the superconducting grain at site @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the phase of the local superconducting order parameter @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the electrical capacitance matrix and @xmath19 is the josephson coupling between nearest - neighbor grains .",
    "the charge @xmath14 in each grain can be expressed in terms of the excess number of cooper pairs @xmath20 as @xmath21 . considering a diagonal capacitance matrix @xmath22 and uniform josephson - coupling energies @xmath23 ,",
    "leads to the self - charging model @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the charging energies of the grains .",
    "the number operator @xmath20 is conjugate to the phase @xmath16 , satisfying the commutation relation @xmath26=-i\\delta_{ij } , \\label{jjacomm}\\ ] ] and can be written as @xmath27 , having integer eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "the model of eq .",
    "( [ jja ] ) can also be regarded as a boson hubbard model @xcite where the charging energy represents the onsite coulomb repulsion of bosons and the josephson coupling represents the hopping term .    when the charging energies are uniform @xmath29 , a pseudo - spin one model for the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ jja ] ) can be constructed by truncating the basis vectors of the number operators @xmath30 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , corresponding to the lowest charging energy states . identifying the charging states , @xmath33 , as the eigenstates of @xmath34 for spin @xmath9 , writting the second term of eq .",
    "( [ jja ] ) in terms of @xmath35 and making the correspondence @xmath36 one obtains the de gennes mapping to a @xmath9 pseudo - spin model with single - ion spin - anisotropy @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the factor @xmath39 in front of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ pseudomap ] ) takes into account the length of the pseudo spin @xmath41 . in terms of this spin model ,",
    "the superconductor to insulator transition in the original granular superconductor corresponds to a zero temperature transition where the ferromagnetic order of the spins in the @xmath42 plane is destroyed by quantum fluctuations when the @xmath34 component is confined to zero for an increasing ratio of @xmath43 .",
    "although this mapping is not exact @xcite , the @xmath44 critical behavior observed in the original phase model of eq .",
    "( [ jja ] ) without disorder and the spin model is the same @xcite as found in numerical calculations in one dimension . for higher dimensions",
    ", results from the same mean - field approximation applied to both models also agree @xcite .",
    "to consider the main effects of disorder in the charging energies @xmath45 , we generalize the above approximate mapping to a pseudo - spin model with randomness in the spin - size values @xmath46 .",
    "since for a given charging energy ( or temperature fluctuation ) , low values of @xmath45 correspond to charging states with higher @xmath20 , it seems reasonable to use a truncation scheme which identifies the charging states @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the @xmath34-eigenstates of the spins of different sizes @xmath46 and @xmath49 , such that the corresponding maximum charging energies @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the grains are both comparable to the same truncation energy ( here @xmath52 is the length of the spin @xmath53 ) .",
    "this ( approximate ) mapping leads to the effective spin hamiltonian @xmath54 with randomness in the spin - size values @xmath46 . here , @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the average value of @xmath45 and @xmath58 the average value of @xmath59",
    "the spin sizes @xmath46 are restricted to take only integer values @xmath60 in this mapping . in eq .",
    "( [ haniso ] ) , randomness in the spin - size also leads to randomness in the local single - ion anisotropy parameter , but these random variables are only correlated at the same site .    a typical spin - size distribution we shall be considering is @xmath61 where three spin - size values @xmath62 and @xmath63 are mixed with average value @xmath64 and a concentration @xmath65 , which is a measure of the disorder .",
    "it is also convenient to rewrite the spin model of eq .",
    "( [ haniso ] ) in terms of normalized spins @xmath66 @xmath67 in this latter form , a bimodal distribution of spin values can be considered : @xmath68 which in the special case @xmath69 corresponds to the dilution of a spin-@xmath70 system or to percolating granular superconductors @xcite in the presence of charging effects .",
    "for high enough space dimensions @xmath4 , reasonable results can be obtained from simple mean - field approximations ( mfa ) .",
    "the mfa replaces all variables around a given small cluster with their average value , or order parameter , and then use the resulting approximate hamiltonian to evaluate the order parameter itself . since the spin sizes are random , one must carry out the averaging procedure with respect to @xmath71 as well and we denote this by @xmath72_{ave}$ ] .",
    "the simplest cluster is a single spin on a site . with @xmath73_{ave}$ ] the mean field , this yields a self - consistent equation for the order parameter @xmath74 :    @xmath75_{ave}=\\left [ \\frac{1}{z_{mfa } } tr_{{\\bf s}_i } { \\bf s}_i e^{-\\beta{\\bar h}_{mfa } } \\right]_{ave } , \\label{mfa1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is the mean - field hamiltonian and @xmath77 . for the anisotropic hamiltonian of eq .",

    "the mfa hamiltonian then becomes :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is a dimensionless expansion parameter .",
    "since we are interested in the phase transition line only , we can assume @xmath84 small and use a first - order perturbation expansion to solve eq .",
    "( [ mfa1 ] ) for arbitrary spin @xmath11 . in a now single - site problem ,",
    "we reabsorb a factor @xmath85 into @xmath86 and @xmath12 .",
    "the unperturbed states @xmath87 are eigenstates of @xmath34 and thus also of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "we have @xmath90 where to first - order @xmath91 and    @xmath92    here , the prime on @xmath93 means @xmath94 .",
