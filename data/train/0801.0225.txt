    "hawking radiation primarily arises due to the asymmetry in the extent of the redshift and the blueshift of the modes of a quantum field as they propagate through matter that is collapsing gravitationally and , eventually , goes on to become a black hole  @xcite . consider a typical mode that constitutes hawking radiation at the future null infinity ( i.e. at @xmath1 ) , say , the mode where the intensity of the radiation is the maximum and whose wavelength can be identified , for instance , using wein s law .",
    "when one traces such a mode back to the past null infinity ( i.e. to @xmath2 ) where the initial conditions are imposed on the quantum field , one finds that the energy of the mode turns out to be way beyond the planck scale .",
    "( this feature seems to have been originally noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in this context , also see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as hawking radiation mostly consists of modes that leave the future event horizon just before its formation , such a phenomenon essentially occurs due to the enormous red - shifting of the modes near the horizon .",
    "this behavior then raises the question as to whether the planck scale effects will modify the spectrum of hawking radiation and the associated stress - energy tensor of the quantum field .",
    "there has been a sufficient amount of effort in the literature towards understanding the effects of planck scale physics on hawking radiation ( for the earliest discussions , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and , for relatively recent efforts , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the absence of a workable quantum theory of gravity , to study the planck scale effects , most of these efforts ( apart from one notable exception , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) consider phenomenological models constructed by hand ",
    "models which purportedly contain one or more features of the actual effective theory obtained by integrating out the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "these models either introduce new features in the standard dispersion relation  @xcite , or work with a classical fluctuating geometry  @xcite , or assume that the spacetime coordinates are non - commutative  @xcite . often ",
    "though , we should hasten to add  but , not always , these high energy models do not preserve local lorentz invariance .",
    "moreover , some of them either consider a simpler model of hawking radiation ( say , the popular model of a moving mirror in flat space - time  @xcite ) rather than the actual situation , or just consider the spherically symmetric ( i.e. the @xmath3 ) mode in higher dimensional cases , which , essentially , reduces to studying the effects in @xmath4-dimensions . our aim in this work , is to use a locally lorentz invariant approach to evaluate the planck scale modifications to stress - energy tensor around a black hole without resorting to such approximations .",
    "general arguments based on the merging of essential concepts from general relativity and quantum mechanics seem to indicate that it may not be possible to probe spacetime intervals smaller than the planck length , say , @xmath5 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "an approach that introduces such a ` zero - point length ' into standard quantum field theory while preserving local lorentz invariance is the so - called principle of path integral duality ( for the original discussion , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for various applications of the approach , see refs .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that , at low energies ( when compared to the string scale ) , the modified propagator of matter fields obtained through such an approach is equivalent to taking into account the string fluctuations propagating along compact extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "effectively , the path integral duality approach can be said to provide a prescription to evaluate the modified green s function of a free quantum field that is propagating in a given classical background ( for further details , see the following section ) . in this work , we shall use this prescription to evaluate the modified green s function and the planck scale corrections to the stress - energy tensor around a specific black hole .    in @xmath6-dimensions",
    ", it proves to be difficult to evaluate the two - point function exactly around even the simplest of black holes . as a result ,",
    "the stress - energy tensor of a quantum field around , say , the schwarzschild black hole has been evaluated only under an approximation ( see , for example , refs .",
    "in contrast , the spacetime around the @xmath7-dimensional , rotating banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz , hereafter ) black hole  @xcite provides a situation wherein it is possible to calculate the two - point function in a closed form  @xcite .",
    "we shall utilize this feature to compute the duality modified propagator and the corresponding planck scale corrections to the standard stress - energy tensor around the rotating btz black hole .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we shall briefly outline as to how the principle of path integral duality modifies the two - point function of a free quantum field evolving in a given spacetime . in section  [ sec : mgfn ] , we evaluate the modified propagator around the rotating btz black hole , and show that the path integral duality approach regulates the ultra - violet behavior of the two - point function . in section  [ sec : mst ] , we evaluate the stress - energy tensor associated with the modified two - point function and graphically illustrate the form of the planck scale modifications to the stress - energy tensor .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] , we close with a brief discussion on the results we have obtained .    before we proceed , a few words on our notations and conventions are in order .",
    "we shall work in @xmath7-dimensions and adopt the metric signature of @xmath8 .",
    "also , for convenience , we shall denote the set of three coordinates @xmath9 as @xmath10 , and use natural units such that @xmath11 .",
    "recently , it was shown that , when the fluctuations of closed strings along compact extra dimensions are taken into account , one arrives at an effective propagator for point particles that is regular at high energies  @xcite .",
    "it was found that , the @xmath12-duality symmetry between the topologically non - trivial excitations and the winding modes of the strings around the compact dimensions leads to a modified propagator in the minkowski vacuum wherein the original spacetime interval @xmath13 between the two spacetime events @xmath10 and @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath15 $ ] , where , as we mentioned above , @xmath0 denotes the planck length .",
    "thus , effectively , the string fluctuations introduce a zero point length @xmath0 into the standard field theory .",
    "a similar modification of the minkowski propagator has been obtained earlier by invoking the principle of path integral duality  @xcite .",
    "recall that , in standard quantum field theory , the path integral amplitude for a path connecting events  @xmath10 and  @xmath16 in a given spacetime is proportional to the proper length , say , @xmath17 , between the two events .",
    "the duality principle proposes that the path integral amplitude should be invariant under the transformation @xmath18 .",
    "operationally , it turns out to be convenient to express the effect of the duality approach and the string fluctuations on the propagator in terms of the schwinger s proper time formulation  @xcite .",
    "one finds that , in such a formulation , the string fluctuations and the duality approach effectively modify the weightage given to a point particle of mass @xmath19 , from @xmath20 to @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "consider a free scalar field of mass  @xmath19 that is propagating in a given classical gravitational background described by the metric tensor  @xmath22 .",
    "let us further assume that the field is non - minimally coupled to gravity . in schwinger s proper time formalism , the two - point function corresponding to such a scalar field can be expressed as  @xcite g(x , x ) = i_0^ds k(x , x ; s ) , [ eq : gfn ] where @xmath23 is defined as k(x , x ; s ) e^i (-m^2 - r ) s , [ eq : k ] and @xmath24 is the curvature of the background spacetime with @xmath25 being the coefficient of the non - minimal coupling . in other words ,",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is the path integral amplitude for a quantum mechanical system described by the following hamiltonian : = -(-m^2- r ) - _  ( g^ _ ) + m^2 + r. [ eq : hk ] as we mentioned , the effects due to path integral duality or , equivalently , the string fluctuations , correspond to modifying the expression  ( [ eq : gfn ] ) above for the two - point function to  @xcite g^m(x , x ) = i_0^ds e^i l__p^2/4s k(x , x ; s).[eq : mgfn ] in the following section , we shall make use of this prescription to evaluate the modified two - point function around the rotating btz black hole .",
    "the rotating btz black hole is an axially symmetric vacuum solution of the einstein s equations in three - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime ( ads@xmath27 , hereafter ) .",

    "these figures clearly indicate that , rotation only changes the magnitude of the stress - energy tensor and does not alter its qualitative behavior . it either increases or decreases monotonically with the distance from the horizon , as in the non - rotating case",
    ". moreover , the larger the @xmath33 , the smaller is the difference in the stress - energy tensor between the non - rotating and rotating cases .",
    "furthermore , it is evident from the figures that , this difference is the maximum at the horizon and it decreases with the distance from the horizon .      the planck scale modifications to the stress - energy tensor around the rotating btz black hole can now be arrived at upon using the modified green s function  ( [ eq : mgfnbtz ] ) in the expression  ( [ eq : set ] ) .",
    "the structure of the modified stress - energy tensor turns out to be the same as in the standard case . when the black hole is not rotating , the only non - zero components of the modified stress - energy tensor are the diagonal components , which we shall refer to as @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . around a rotating black hole , as in the unmodified case ,",

    "we find that , for an @xmath0 as large as @xmath96 , the change in the stress - energy tensor is of the order of @xmath97@xmath98 at the horizon . for any smaller value of @xmath0 , the modified case turns out to be completely indistinguishable from the unmodified one . therefore , we can conclude that , for any realistic @xmath0 , the modifications are completely negligible .",
    "this result corroborates similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier in the literature ( see , for example , refs .",
    "in this work , using the t - duality symmetry of the string fluctuations , we have evaluated the modified two - point function and the resulting stress - energy tensor around the rotating btz black hole .",
    "we should emphasize here that we have not made any approximation whatsoever in our calculations and the results we have obtained around the btz black hole are exact .",
    "this is important , since , as we had mentioned in the introductory section , much of the earlier analyses had either worked with the moving mirror model of hawking radiation in @xmath4-dimensions or had just considered the spherically symmetric mode in @xmath6-dimensions , which , effectively , simplifies to the lower dimensional model .",
    "moreover , we are not aware of any earlier analysis in the literature wherein the planck scale effects have been studied around a rotating black hole .",
    "interestingly , we find that the modified green s function remains finite in the coincident limit . actually , such a result could have been expected based on the schwinger - dewitt expansion of the kernel @xmath26  @xcite . according to the expansion , for small separations , the kernel in an arbitrary spacetime has the same form as in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "therefore , if the modified green s function is ultra - violet regulated in flat spacetime , then it can be expected to remain finite in the coincident limit in any curved spacetime as well .",
    "further , we find that the planck scale modifications to the stress - energy tensor are negligibly small , in agreement with similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier in the literature  @xcite",
    ".    ideally , rather than evaluate the planck scale modifications to the stress - energy tensor , one would like to evaluate the corrections to hawking radiation itself .",
    "this in turn requires that one considers a dynamical situation , and evaluates either the effective lagrangian or the in - out bogoliubov coefficient , while taking into account the planck scale modifications .",

    "<S> modes emerging out of a collapsing black hole are red - shifted to such an extent that hawking radiation at future null infinity consists of modes that have energies beyond the planck scale at past null infinity . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that physics at the planck scale may modify the spectrum of hawking radiation and the associated stress - energy tensor of the quantum field . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown that , the t - duality symmetry of string fluctuations along compact extra dimensions leads to a modification of the standard propagator of point particles in quantum field theory . at low energies ( when compared to the string scale ) , the modified propagator is found to behave as though the spacetime possesses a minimal length , say , @xmath0 , which we shall assume to be of the order of the planck length . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the duality approach to evaluate the modified propagator around the rotating banados - teitelboim - zanelli black hole and show that the propagator is finite in the coincident limit . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the stress - energy tensor associated with the modified green s function and illustrate graphically that the quantum gravitational corrections turn out to be negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by briefly commenting on the results we have obtained . </S>"
