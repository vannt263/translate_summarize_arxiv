    "however , observations of a sample of emission - line galaxies with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) have indicated that dwarf star - forming galaxies are less likely to be detected in the far infrared than their higher luminosity counterparts @xcite .",
    "these galaxies could be more difficult to detect in the fir due to a lack of dust , a different dust grain size distribution , or a different dust temperature distribution .",
    "the mid - infrared to millimeter spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of a small number of nearby dwarf galaxies selected for their high star - formation rates indicate that some dwarf star - forming systems do contain a significant amount of dust but that the systems probably lack pahs and have a small average dust grain size @xcite .",
    "the launch of the spitzer space telescope @xcite has opened up a new window on the study of star - formation processes in galaxies .",
    "the irac instrument @xcite in particular allows us to measure both the stellar emission and the hot dust and pah emission in local galaxies .",
    "one of the first dwarf galaxies to be examined in detail with spitzer was the blue compact dwarf galaxy sbs 0335 - 052 @xcite .",

    "the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) is a modern objective - prism survey that combines the methodology of many of the classic wide - field color- and line - selected surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "kiss selects objects for inclusion in the survey lists if they possess a strong ( @xmath4 5@xmath5 ) emission line in their low - dispersion objective - prism spectra .",
    "the survey has been carried out in two distinct spectral regions : the blue portion ( 4800  5500",
    " ) where the primary line observed is [ ] @xmath65007 , and the red region ( 6400  7200  ) where galaxies are selected by their h@xmath7 emission . to date",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , hereafter kr3 ) .",
    "for the current study , we have selected a sample of dwarf star - forming galaxies from kr3 .",
    "this survey list was derived from objective - prism data taken of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) area located in botes .",
    "both of the ndwfs fields were targeted by kiss to take advantage of the tremendous amount of multi - wavelength data planned for these areas .",
    "all of the kiss elg candidates in the botes field possess follow - up slit spectra @xcite .",
    "higher dispersion follow - up spectra are necessary in order to verify the reality of the putative emission lines seen in the objective - prism spectra . in addition",
    ", the survey data alone do not have sufficient dispersion or spectral range to provide accurate redshifts or to distinguish between the various activity types that might be present in a line - selected sample ( e.g. , star - forming galaxies vs.  agns ) .",
    "these follow - up spectra provide us with a great deal of useful information ( e.g. , accurate redshifts , emission - line fluxes and line ratios , reddening and metallicity estimates ) .",
    "the combination of the accurate b and v photometry from the original survey lists with these follow - up spectra allow for the construction of a fairly complete picture of the properties of the kiss elgs .",
    "the selection of the kiss galaxies from the kr3 list was defined by several criteria . for emission - line galaxies selected by their h@xmath7 emission ( in the red ) ,",
    "the redshift limit of the survey is @xmath8 .",
    "the two selection criteria used to define the sample were that the galaxies exhibit spectra consistent with excitation by star - formation processes ( i.e. , agns were excluded ) , and that they have a b - band absolute magnitude m@xmath918.0 ( for h@xmath10 = 75 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) .",
    "thus these galaxies are selected to be star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "these criteria produced a list of 26 galaxies within the ndwfs botes area .",
    "however , of those 26 galaxies , only 19 overlap with the spitzer shallow survey area because the spitzer survey field is smaller than the ndwfs field . we discuss only these 19 galaxies in our analysis .",
    "table 1 presents the kiss data for this sample .",
    "all magnitudes discussed in this paper are vega relative magnitudes .",
    "the field from which our sample of 19 dwarf star - forming galaxies was drawn has multi - wavelength optical and infrared coverage from the ndwfs @xcite and the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "the ndwfs provides b , r , and i - band data that complement the broadband b and v band optical data from the kiss survey .",
    "k - band data from the ndwfs are also available for 11 of the 19 galaxies in the field .",
    "the k - band for the remaining galaxies are not yet publicly available from the ndwfs .",
    "the 2mass data have been included in this table for completeness and as a reference for future work with this sample even though we do not use the data here .",
    "the 2mass data are only deep enough to detect four galaxies in this sample . because these four sources are compact and near the 2mass detection limits , they are only identified in the point source catalog .",
    "the photometry available from the ndwfs is more reliable than the 2mass data .",
    "note that for the 2 sources for which 2mass and ndwfs data exist , the ndwfs measurements are much brighter .",
    "the 2mass point source measurements are missing a lot of the extended galaxy flux that is below the detection limit of the survey .",
    "the agreement between the kiss and ndwfs b - band photometry is excellent for all of the galaxies except kiss 2344 .",
    "this object is very extended and was not well fit by the automated ndwfs software ( sextractor  auto \" magnitudes are used , @xcite ) , which underestimated the flux of this source by a magnitude relative to the kiss value . for the rest of the sample , however , the average difference between the kiss and ndwfs magnitudes for the rest of the sample is only 0.04 magnitudes .",
    "table 2 contains the ndwfs and 2mass photometry for the 19 galaxies in the sample .      using the infrared array camera ( irac ) aboard the spitzer space telescope ,",
    "the majority of the ndwfs was mapped at 3.6 - 8.0 @xmath0 m in january 2004 @xcite .",
    "this project , known as the irac shallow survey , covered 8.5 square degrees ",
    "most but not all of the ndwfs field . the observed region was selected to have the lowest background in the irac bands . because not all of the ndwfs field is covered , three of the 26 kiss galaxies in this field are just off the eastern edge of the field and four are in the southeast corner of the field where there is a hole in the coverage .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we discuss only the 19 sources with coverage in the spitzer irac bands .",
    "each position in the survey field was covered with three 30 s irac frames , resulting in a depth of 19.1 , 18.3 , 15.9 , and 15.2 vega magnitudes ( @xmath12 ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "this depth was reached by tiling the 5  @xmath13 5   irac fov over the field .",
    "the basic image processing and mosaicing of the spitzer data are discussed in detail by @xcite . from the resulting mosaiced images ( version 1.1 ) , postage stamps 100 @xmath13 100 pixels in size were extracted for our sample galaxies ( except for kiss 2344 which is more extended so we extracted a 200 @xmath13 200 pixel postage stamp , the pixel scale for all postage stamps is 0.86@xmath14  per pixel ) .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] shows three color images for all of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "the images , created prior to the point source subtraction , provide a look at the colors and morphologies of the objects in the sample .    because of the high point source density in the fields , we subtracted point sources from the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m data prior to deriving photometry for the galaxies . in the 3.6 @xmath0 m band 7",
    " 39% of the flux in the aperture is due to the point sources in the vicinity of our galaxy .",
    "the flux due to point sources in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band is less than in the 3.6 @xmath0 m band for most sources , but the range is from @xmath33  36% .",
    "the point source removal was done using the apex program within the mopex package provided by the spitzer science center .",
    "the psf used was constructed by marengo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and was smoothed to match the resolution of the mosaiced images and then used by the apex program to identify candidate point sources in the images .",
    "we defined the apex detection parameters so that all of the stars were selected , but the result was that non - stellar peaks in faint parts of the galaxy were also identified .",
    "the point sources selected by apex were then checked by hand in order to eliminate non - stellar sources from the point source list .",
    "the resulting point sources were then subtracted from the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m images .",
    "overall the point source subtraction worked well , but the centers of the brightest stars which are non - linear or saturated left a residual . for the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m data , the point source density was not high enough to warrant point source subtraction as was done in the shorter wavelength bands .",
    "galaxy photometry was performed on the processed , mosaiced , and , for the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m images , point source - subtracted images using the ellipse routine within iraf .",
    "point sources in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands and post point source subtraction residuals in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands were masked using ellipse .",
    "an elliptical aperture was fit to the galaxy , the aperture ellipticity and position angle were fixed , and then apertures were computed over the background region beyond the extent of the galaxy . the level determined from the background annulus",
    "was then used to subtract the local background from the image .",
    "after the subtraction , the fitting was rerun using these same aperture parameters out to the largest radius before the background was reached as determined from the curve of growth of the flux .",
    "the aperture defined by the 3.6 @xmath0 m data was then used to determine the flux in the other bands .",
    "the results of the irac photometry are presented in table 3 .",
    "the combination of the optical and irac observations provide a probe of stellar and dust emission in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] shows a template sed for an irregular galaxy .",
    "this sed template is based on the @xcite distribution derived in the optical and the @xcite distribution in the infrared .",
    "the template is an empirical derivation of the sed extrapolated between the available bands .",
    "the optical bands , as well as the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m irac bands probe the stellar emission from the galaxy . the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands , while dominated by the stellar emission , can also be influenced by hot dust emission ( particularly the 4.5 @xmath0 m band ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m irac bands probe the rayleigh - jeans tail of the hot dust continuum as well as the pah emission features from the galaxy .",
    "there is a degeneracy between the slope of the hot dust continuum and the strength of the pah emission features which does not allow us to distinguish between them using broad - band color information . for this analysis",
    "we focus on the 3.6 @xmath0 m and the 8.0 @xmath0 m emission as probes of the stellar and pah or hot dust emission in the galaxies that we are studying . the [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] color provides a measure of the dust - to - stars ratio in the galaxies .",
    "the points in figure [ fig : schematic ] show seds for two of the galaxies in this sample to illustrate the differences in their properties .",
    "the circles show the sed for kiss 2309 while the triangles show the sed for kiss 2349 .",
    "the two seds have been normalized so that they overlap in the k - band .",
    "the optical / near - infrared photometry has been computed in different apertures for the kiss and ndwfs data , but the extremely good correlation between the magnitudes measured in the b - band ( @xmath16 ) indicates that the values are consistent .",
    "a fixed aperture is used for all of the mid - infrared measurements , but this are not the same aperture as used in the optical / near - infrared . because we use a large aperture intended to contain all of the light , the aperture corrections between the mid - infrared and the optical / near - infrared should be small",
    ". the application of an aperture correction would result in a small vertical shift for all of the mid - infrared points in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",

    "this sed clearly shows evidence for hot dust or , possibly , pah emission .",
    "by contrast , the sed of kiss 2309 continues to fall into the mid - infrared showing much less hot dust or pah emission ( [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath18 ) , but the colors are still in excess of the extrapolation of the stellar portion of the template .",
    "all of the galaxies in this sample show evidence for 8.0 @xmath0 m emission in excess of the stellar light .",
    "both galaxies show extremely blue optical colors even relative to the k - band flux .",
    "these galaxies are dominated by a young stellar population even relative to an average irregular galaxy .      despite the low detection rate for star - forming dwarf galaxies at longer infrared wavelengths",
    "@xcite , we detected all 19 galaxies in all four bands with only a short exposure time . only at 5.8 @xmath0 m",
    "are a couple of the galaxies approaching the detection limit of the instrument because of the combination of lower sensitivity at these wavelengths and a minimum in the spectral energy distribution as can be seen in figure [ fig : schematic ] . in particular , the detection of these galaxies at 8.0 @xmath0 m indicates more emission from hot dust and/or pahs than might be expected for such low - luminosity and generally low - metallicity systems .",
    "figure [ fig : fluxhist ] shows the distribution of fluxes at 3.6 and 8.0 @xmath0 m for the galaxies in the sample .",
    "the galaxies have been selected to be low - luminosity systems with a luminosity limit of m@xmath19  one galaxy that is at this limit within the errors ( m@xmath20 ) is also included . after correcting for internal extinction using the ad hoc method developed by @xcite",
    "we have found that three additional objects are significantly higher luminosity galaxies .",
    "there are two additional galaxies for which the spectra are not of high enough quality to determine whether an extinction correction is appropriate .",
    "these are the two systems in table 1 that do not have measured metallicities .",
    "we continue to include all nineteen galaxies in the sample and indicate which galaxies do not have a measured internal extinction correction and which galaxies do not have measured metallicities .",
    "we analyse the higher - luminosity galaxies separately since they are not actually part of the dwarf galaxy sample .",

    "the small grey dots represent all of the objects identified as galaxies in the shallow survey catalog ( version 1.1 ) .",
    "for these objects we use the cataloged magnitudes (  auto \" aperture magnitudes determined using sextractor @xcite ) . as noted by @xcite , the majority of the shallow survey galaxies fall in two limited regions of color - space .",
    "the locus of points with [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath28 contains mostly early - type systems while the group of galaxies with redder [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] colors are generally late - type systems . the outliers ( @xmath29 b - r @xmath30 and [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath31 ) in this plot may be objects with poorly measured magnitudes because of the automated nature of the measurement or they may be objects with extreme colors .",
    "nevertheless , the plot provides a good way to see where the kiss galaxies fall with respect to colors of the galaxies within the shallow survey field .",
    "the kiss galaxies are denoted by three different point types in this and all subsequent plots .",
    "we denote the four galaxies that turn out to be more luminous than m@xmath32 after the correction for internal extinction by @xmath13 s .",
    "the two galaxies for which the spectra are not good enough to determine whether a correction for internal extinction should be applied ( or to measure an abundance ) are denoted by open circles .",
    "the rest of the galaxies are denoted by filled black circles .",
    "these objects have enough data to indicate that they are probably true dwarf galaxies by our luminosity criteria .",
    "the optical colors for the kiss galaxies in figure [ fig : colorplot ] have not been corrected for extinction for consistency with the colors of the full galaxy sample . while the kiss galaxies are blue optically , they span the red end of the range of mid - infrared colors .    the mid - infrared colors of the kiss galaxies are only slightly correlated with the absolute 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosities of the systems as shown in figure [ fig : masslum ] .",
    "the figure indicates that the bluest galaxies in the mid - infrared are the lowest luminosity systems , but the colors have a spread of up to 2 magnitudes for any given 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "figure [ fig : colorplot ] and all of the subsequent figures showing the [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] colors for the kiss galaxies indicate that these systems span a wide range of mid - infrared colors .",
    "this range is an indication that some of the galaxies have very high dust - to - stars ratios while others do not , as illustrated in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the high dust - to - stars ratios are evidence for strong emission from hot dust and/or pahs , but without spectroscopy it is impossible to distinguish between a steep slope to the dust continuum and a pah emission line . however , the evidence from the study of low - metallicity galaxies by @xcite is that most low - metallicity systems have a deficit of pah emission , but an excess of hot dust .",
    "this analysis is certainly consistent with the colors of these dwarf galaxies which also tend to be low - metallicity systems .",

    "the kiss galaxies are low luminosity and mostly metal poor systems , making them potential analogs of the galactic building blocks at high redshift .",
    "we use the emission - line measurements from the follow - up spectroscopy to derive the [ n ii]/h@xmath7 and [ o iii]/h@xmath33 ratios for the galaxies .",
    "these ratios are used to determine the galaxies metallicity as described in @xcite .",
    "seventeen of the nineteen galaxies have measured line ratios and , therefore , calculated metallicities .",
    "the other two galaxies possess noisy spectra where some of the emission lines needed for deriving a metallicity estimate could not be measured .    while there is one super - solar metallicity source ( kiss 2316 ) , it has a luminosity that is brighter than the m@xmath35=18 cutoff after it is corrected for extinction .",

    "the correlation between luminosity and metallicity provides a probe of the relationship between the metallicity of a galaxy and either the stellar mass as measured by the @xmath37 or 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosity or the mid - infrared emission from dust as measured by the 8.0 @xmath0 m luminosity . figure [ fig : lummet ] shows these correlations for the kiss sample .",
    "the b - band magnitudes have been corrected for extinction ( for the 3 red , high c@xmath38 sources )  the galaxies for which the internal extinction correction is uncertain do not have measured abundances so they are not plotted .",
    "the fits to these relations include only the dwarf galaxies in the sample .",
    "in addition to the correlation between the b - band and 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosities and the metallicity , the 8.0@xmath0 m luminosity is also correlated with metallicity .",
    "this result indicates that even in these low - metallicity systems which might not have pahs , the hot dust and/or pah emission is correlated with metallicity .",

    "these slopes are in contrast with the slopes for a sample of kiss star - forming galaxies covering a large range in luminosity , @xmath39m@xmath40 , which have a steeper b - band slope of -0.28 ( @xcite , computed using the @xcite metallicity calibration as was also done for the kiss galaxies presented here ) .",
    "however , the slope is consistent with those obtained for dwarf galaxy samples studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which have b - band slopes of -0.15 and by @xcite whose dwarf sample has a slope of -0.17 .",
    "these data provide further evidence for the dwarf galaxy relation having a flatter slope than that exhibited by the more luminous systems .",
    "the interpretation of the extremely shallow slope at 8.0 @xmath0 m will have to wait until we have a better understanding of the nature of this emission ( e.g. , the exact mixture of pah and hot dust emission ) .",
    "the @xmath41 scatter in metallicity around these fits is 0.17 ( 8.0 @xmath0 m ) , 0.16 ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) , and 0.16 ( b - band ) respectively .",
    "if stellar mass and metallicity are correlated the scatter at 3.6@xmath0 m should be tighter than in the b - band because extinction is less of a factor .",
    "we do not see any evidence for a lower scatter or a different slope at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "figure [ fig : colabund ] shows the relationship between the mid - infrared color ( dust - to - stars ratio ) and the metallicity of the kiss galaxies . while the figure shows that the more metal - rich galaxies all have red mid - infrared colors , three of the galaxies with the reddest [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] are low - metallicity systems .",

    "the galaxies for which the metallicity is not determined ( 2 systems ) , the standard @xcite conversion is used .",
    "the metallicity correction takes into account the difference between the number of lyman continuum photons in solar metallicity models and models with lower metallicities that are closer in value to the observed abundances of our dwarf star - forming galaxies .",
    "the correction method is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the radiation field in low metallicity systems is much harder so the inferred star - formation rate is somewhat lower at a given h@xmath7 luminosity compared to a metal - rich galaxy .",
    "two of the three galaxies with high star - formation rates are luminous systems while the third is one of the galaxies with a noisy spectrum so it might also be a higher luminosity source .",
    "the star - formation rates for the dwarf galaxies are modest for low - luminosity systems  the rates are not as high as they are in some of the most strongly star - forming blue compact dwarf galaxies but they are still fairly strong for such low - luminosity dwarfs .",
    "figure [ fig : sfrplot ] shows the relationship between mid - infrared color and sfr for the kiss galaxies .",
    "the galaxies without an internal extinction correction do not have a measured metallicity so the sfr determined from the standard @xcite conversion is probably an over - estimate .",
    "while figure [ fig : colabund ] shows that some of the low - metallicity systems in this sample have red [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] , figure [ fig : sfrplot ] shows that all of the red galaxies have high star - formation rates .",
    "the strength of the 8.0 @xmath0 m dust emission is much more strongly correlated with the star - formation rate than it is with the metallicity of these systems .",
    "we have presented the observations of 19 star - forming galaxies from the kiss survey observed with the irac camera on the spitzer space telescope . despite the small fraction of star - forming dwarf galaxies detected with iras @xcite",
    ", we have detected all sample galaxies .",
    "many are quite bright at mid - infrared wavelengths , as shown in figures [ fig : fluxhist ] and [ fig : maghist ] .",
    "in particular , the emission detected at 8.0 @xmath0 m indicates a significant amount of dust resides in some of these systems .",
    "one of the most striking features of the kiss sample in the mid - infrared is its diversity .",
    "this is a complete sample of low - luminosity galaxies that show evidence for star - formation through the presence of an h@xmath7 emission line .",
    "we find that the mid - infrared colors for some of the galaxies resemble those of dust - poor , low star - formation early - type galaxies while others have colors as red or redder than the late - type galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the red colors are indicative of hot dust and/or pah emission in these systems .",
    "the galaxies with bluer colors have low star formation rates and may also have a lower dust content or a lack of hot dust . if corruption of the 3.6 @xmath0 m flux by hot dust is a problem it might result in blue colors like those seen for some of these dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , the shape of the sed shown in figure [ fig : schematic ] and the correlation between low star - formation rates and blue colors in these galaxies makes corruption of the 3.6 @xmath0 m flux by hot dust an unlikely explanation .",
    "@xcite found that the low - luminosity galaxies in the overlap between the sloan digital sky survey and the spitzer first look survey had significantly bluer mid - infrared colors than the higher luminosity systems with similar optical colors .",
    "the galaxies in the kiss sample also show a significant number of systems with blue optical and mid - infrared colors .",
    "however , we also note that in our sample and , in smaller numbers ( possibly because they were not selecting star - forming dwarf galaxies in particular ) in the @xcite sample , the reddest low - luminosity galaxies are consistent with the reddest high luminosity systems with comparable optical colors . in the @xcite sample",
    "the reddest high luminosity objects have [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath42 ( all comparisons here are converted to the vega magnitude system ) but most of the late - type galaxies have colors that are closer to [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath43 .",
    "the reddest low - luminosity galaxies in the @xcite sample have [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath44 while the reddest kiss galaxies have [ 3.6 ] @xmath15 [ 8.0 ] @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the deficit of red mid - infrared colors for low - luminosity galaxies in their sample could indicate that the supernova driven hot winds are driving dust and metals out the galaxies as happens to low - mass halos in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the correlation between luminosity and metallicity in galaxies has also been used as a probe of the relationship between a galaxy s stellar population and the build - up of metals . in the kiss sample",
    "we find a significant number of low - luminosity galaxies with very red mid - infrared colors which clearly indicate the presence of hot dust and/or pahs .",
    "this finding may indicate that the dust is not escaping from these galaxies as has been conjectured or that we are not probing the escaping dust .",
    "instead we may be probing a region very close to the star formation where the temperatures and possibly the dust properties in these low - metallicity systems might be different from those of the general galaxy population .",
    "this latter possibility is would help explain the observation that 8.0 @xmath0 m dust emission is better correlated with star - formation rate then it is with metallicity .",
    "figure [ fig : masslum ] shows that some of the lowest mass galaxies , as indicated by their 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosity , are also very blue and might be good candidates for dust expulsion by the winds .",
    "these are the same galaxies in figure [ fig : lummet ] that are low luminosity at 3.6 @xmath0 m and b - band and are also low metallicity , possibly further corroborating the notion that some of the metals and the dust is escaping . on the other hand , there are also low - mass galaxies that have red mid - infrared colors , indicating that they have been able to retain their dust , but are still low - metallicity systems . clearly",
    "a measurement of the dynamical mass of these galaxies , rather than just a measurement of the stellar mass , is important for determining whether the galaxies with blue colors are the lowest mass halos .",
    "alternatively , these galaxies with blue colors in the mid - infrared may just be producing less dust or be less efficient at heating it rather than losing it in winds since they have the lowest star - formation rates .",
    "the correlation between b - band luminosity and metallicity shown in figure [ fig : lummet ] has been observed before and our results are completely consistent with the previous results for dwarf galaxies .",
    "it has been noted that one would expect to see this relation extended into the mid - infrared since the 3.6 @xmath0 m emission is also tied to the stellar mass of the galaxy and that is indeed what this figure shows .",
    "the more surprising result is that we also see a correlation between the 8.0 @xmath0 m luminosity and metallicity indicating that even in these low - metallicity systems , the emission from hot dust ( or pahs if they are present ) is correlated with the metallicity of the system .",
    "it is unclear whether this result is due to dust grain size , temperature distribution in the star - forming regions , or some other physical property .    while we find that the 8.0 @xmath0 m dust emission is correlated with star formation much more than it is with metallicity in the kiss galaxies ( figure [ fig : sfrplot ] ) , the connection between the hot dust / pah emission seen at these mid - infrared wavelengths and the dust responsible for extinction at optical wavelengths is much less clear . for the 2 galaxies in our sample with very high values of c@xmath34 ( greater than 1 ) , the mid - infrared colors are very red indicating high dust - to - stars ratios",
    "however , for galaxies with lower values of c@xmath34 , there is no evidence for a correlation with the mid - infrared color . these results are consistent with iras observations of star - forming dwarf galaxies that showed no correlation between c@xmath34 and far infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "while the mid - infrared emission measured in these star - forming dwarf galaxies indicates that these systems contain hot dust and/or pahs , the amount of line - of - sight dust absorption implied by the c@xmath34 parameter is not a good predictor of the amount of mid - ir dust emission present as is also the case in the fir @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared observations of these star - forming dwarf galaxies have highlighted some surprising features of these systems which need to be investigated further .",
    "the spectral energy distributions from the optical through 24 @xmath0 m ( and in a few cases through 160 @xmath0 m ) in these galaxies will be presented in a forthcoming paper and will provide a much more detailed look at the properties of the stars and dust .",
    "in addition , it will be important to obtain systematic spectral observations of a sample of these dwarf galaxies to resolve the question of whether the mid - infrared emission is due to hot dust or the presence of a pah feature at these wavelengths .",
