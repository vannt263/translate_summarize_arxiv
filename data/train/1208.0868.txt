    "reverberation mapping ( rm ) is a powerful tool to probe the structure of the broad emission line region ( blr ) in agns and quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) without the need to resolve the blr .",
    "the basic ideas are that the blr is powered by photoionization by the ( ionizing ) continuum from the accreting black hole and that it responds to the variations of the continuum in a light crossing time .",
    "the response from different parts of the blr will arrive at different time delays with respect to the continuum variation .",
    "thus by mapping a two - dimensional broad line response function in the time delay and velocity plane ( velocity - delay maps , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) one can in principle recover the geometry and kinematics of the blr . over the past several decades , rm has proven to be a practical technique in studying the structure of blrs .",
    "although accurate velocity - time delay mapping is still lacking , rm studies have successfully measured average blr sizes for several dozens of agns and quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in a few cases , crude velocity - delay maps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rm studies have shown that the typical blr size @xmath1 scales approximately with the agn luminosity @xmath2 . in the latest version of the @xmath3 relation ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , @xmath4 .",
    "thus for typical quasar luminosities ( @xmath5 , or bolometric luminosity @xmath6 ) at @xmath7 , the blr size is @xmath8 ( @xmath9as ) .",
    "this scale is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit of 10 m class optical telescopes ( @xmath10 tens of mas ) .",
    "optical / near - ir interferometry with @xmath0as resolution has yet to come .",
    "thus reverberation mapping will remain one of the few practical methods to measure the blr size , along with microlensing in gravitationally lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , measuring the source photocenter positions can achieve a factor of @xmath11 enhancement in precision compared with the image resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath12 is the number of photons received in a bandpass .",
    "this means for @xmath13 photons , the achievable astrometry precision is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the image resolution .",
    "one application of this idea is _ spectroastrometry _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where differential astrometric positions as a function of wavelength ( velocity ) can be used to probe otherwise unresolved sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the astrometric precision approaches the angular blr size , it becomes possible to study the blr structure with astrometric signatures .",
    "a simple application would be to use spectroastrometry to place constraints on the blr structure . a more radical possibility , however , is to detect and model the wobble in the broad line emission photocenter due to reverberation to the continuum variations , since the different arrival times of the blr response will cause shifts in the observed blr photocenter .    in this work",
    "we investigate the feasibility of combing the traditional intensity rm with astrometric information .",
    "unlike spectroastrometry , the reverberation of the blr will directly induce shifts in the photocenter position of broad line emission as a function of time delay and velocity .",
    "as we will show below , the pattern of photocenter shifts is determined by the geometry and kinematics of the blr , thus providing independent constraints on the blr structure , complementary to traditional intensity rm .",
    "although our main focus is on the blr , this method can be readily applied to the reverberation of the dust torus of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or other reverberation systems , where the required astrometric precision might be less stringent .",
    "we describe the basic formalism in  [ sec : form ] and demonstrate this method in  [ sec : model ] and  [ sec : result ] with simple models for the blr .",
    "we briefly discuss the practical issues with this method in  [ sec : disc ] , with an overview on the perspectives of achieving the required astrometric precision in the near future in ",
    "[ sec : disc_astro ] , and conclude in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "let us set up a 3-dimensional cartesian coordinate system ( in the observer frame ) centered on the continuum source ( e.g. , the inner edge of the accretion disk , which we treat as a point source ) , and let the observer be at @xmath14 .",
    "the time delay of response from each point @xmath15 in the blr is then simply : @xmath16 where we use units that normalize the speed of light to @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the distance to the central source , and @xmath19 is the angle between vector @xmath20 and @xmath21 axis .",
    "obviously the iso - delay surface ( i.e. , the surface with constant time delay ) is a paraboloid for an observer located at infinity .",
    "points on the @xmath21 axis , i.e. , on the near side along the line - of - sight ( hereafter los ) , have zero time delay with respect to the continuum variations .    assuming that the observed continuum increases at time @xmath22 by a constant amount @xmath23 for a certain amount of time @xmath24 , and goes back to normal at @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. , the change in continuum luminosity is @xmath26 the response in the broad line intensity is then a function of time @xmath27 and los velocity @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ( assumed isotropic ) responding volume emissivity of the emission region as a function of position , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the 3d coordinate and velocity vectors , @xmath33 is the normalized ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) 3d velocity distribution at point @xmath20 , determined by the kinematic structure of the blr , and @xmath35 denotes the unit vector of the los .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : rm_amp ] ) is equivalent to the traditional rm equation invoking the transfer function ( i.e. , the line intensity response for a @xmath36-function continuum flare ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for simplicity we shall avoid the usage of transfer function and work directly in the time domain in terms of the observed line intensity and photocenter positon for different velocity channels ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we further assume that the blr is transparent to its own emission , i.e. , neglecting absorption and scattering ( as generally assumed in rm ) , then the projected photocenter position of the _ responding _ emission with los velocity @xmath28 as observed by the distance observer is @xmath37    the projected photocenter position integrated over all los velocities is : @xmath38    in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : conti_vary ] ) , if @xmath39 is much smaller compared with the typical blr size @xmath1 , then the continuum light curve can be treated as a ( square wave ) @xmath40function . in this case",
    "the near side of the blr completes reverberation ( i.e. , back to the steady level ) before the far side reverberation reaches the observer . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath41 , then the continuum light curve is a step function , and the near side of the blr will still be in the high state when the far side reverberation reaches the observer . in the following discussion , we will consider the two limiting cases where @xmath42 ( a continuum flare ) and @xmath41 ( a continuum jump ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to demonstrate the astrometric signals from rm , we use simple geometric and kinematic models for the blr , and study the reverberation process . but our approach below is applicable to general cases .",
    "there are few observational constraints on the structure of the blr .",
    "spherical blrs will not produce any photocenter offset .",
    "however , there is evidence that the blr motion may be dominated by rotation , and the blr may have a flattened geometry .",
    "such evidence comes from the dependence of broad line width on orientation angle inferred from radio properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or from modeling the broad line profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the extreme case , the broad lines in @xmath51 agns show a characteristic double - peaked profile , commonly interpreted as arising from a disk geometry with keplerian rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , radial motion of the blr has been inferred from velocity - resolved reverberation mapping in several agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has been suggested that the high - ionization broad line ( such as civ ) may have a component originating from a disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that virial motion and radial motion coexist in the blr .    motivated by these observations , we consider the following simple classes of geometry and kinematics for the blr . in all cases",
    "we assume constant density of the blr , and we assume uniform reprocessing coefficient @xmath52 across the entire blr . therefore the volume emissivity @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath54 , i.e. , spherical shells with the same thickness but different radii will have the same total reverberation intensity . again , we emphasize that our approach is not limited to these assumptions .",
    "we establish an intrinsic coordinate system @xmath55 anchored to the blr , which is rotated from the observer coordinate system @xmath56 by euler angles @xmath57 .    1 .   a triaxial ellipsoid configuration distributed within a shell : @xmath58 .",
    "we further consider a sub - class of this configuration , an oblate spheroid where @xmath59 , which probably more represents a flattened blr geometry .",
    "the velocity field is assumed to be maxwellian , with 1d dispersion equal to the virial velocity at each radius .",
    "spherical shell geometries are also simplified versions of this model .",
    "2 .   a truncated circular razor - thin disk ( @xmath60 ) in the @xmath61 plane , with an inclination angle @xmath62 from the los ( @xmath63-axis in the observer frame ) .",
    "we assume a keplerian velocity field for the disk and the disk rotation is counter - clockwise viewed from @xmath64 .",
    "3 .   a biconical configuration , which is rotationally symmetric about the @xmath65-axis with an opening solid angle @xmath66 , and a radial extent from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "the bicone has an inclination angle @xmath62 from the los ( @xmath63-axis in the observer frame ) .",
    "we assume a biconical radial outflowing velocity structure .",
    "the detailed outflow velocity structure is not important in this work , as we will only consider the blueshifted and redshifted halves of the broad line profile .    to study reverberation mapping in emission line intensity and photocenter offsets for arbitrary geometry and kinematics , we discretize the emission region with a fine cartesian grid of cells @xmath69 and assign velocities to each cell . at each time",
    "@xmath27 , we determine the cells that are reverberating , i.e. , @xmath70 , and compute the reverberation quantities @xmath45 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eqns.([eqn : rm_amp ] ) and ( [ eqn : rm_astro ] ) with direct summation .",
    "this discrete method can efficiently handle any geometry and kinematics to sufficient numeric accuracy relative accuracy . ] compared with integrating eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : rm_amp ] ) and ( [ eqn : rm_astro ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we adopt the units @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the gravitational constant and @xmath75 is the central black hole mass .",
    "in the simplest case of a thin spherical shell ( with radius @xmath1 ) model for the emission line region , the time evolution of the reverberation intensity has simple analytical forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we verified with our numerical approach .",
    "however , due to the spherical geometry , the photocenter does not show any offset as a function of time .",
    "[ fig : rm_examp ] shows several examples for the three non - spherical models described in  [ sec : model ] , for the velocity - integrated case .",
    "since all three models have rotational symmetry , we need only focus on the photocenter offset in the @xmath46-direction , i.e. , the rotation of our model blr preserves symmetry about the @xmath46-axis in the projected @xmath50 plane .",
    "specifically , the intrinsic coordinate system of the blr @xmath55 is rotated about the @xmath47-axis in the observer frame by inclination angle @xmath62 .    for each model",
    "we compute for three orientations @xmath76 and two continuum variability durations @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in all cases the maximum blr radius",
    "is set to be 1 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_examp ] that similar information is encoded in the photocenter reverberation maps as in the traditional intensity reverberation map .",
    "however , the photocenter reverberation maps are more sensitive to the inclination of the flattened blr geometry than the intensity reverberation maps .",
    "the maximum photocenter offset is on the same order as the flux - weighted average size of the blr .",
    "we will return to these points in  [ sec : disc ] .    in the examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_examp ] , a generic feature of the photocenter reverberation is the transition from the near - side photocenter to the far - side photocenter .",
    "if the duration of the continuum variation @xmath79 is short compared with the blr size ( e.g. , a flash ) , this transition is continuous . on the other hand ,",
    "if the duration @xmath24 is long , then there will be a period with no photocenter offset ( i.e. , the entire blr is lit up ) . the spheroid geometry and the disk geometry result in similar astrometric rm signatures .",
    "this is expected because the spheroid model used is close to a flattened disk geometry . in both cases",
    "we see a gradual rise followed by a sharp cutoff around the maximum photocenter offset after the continuum returns to the base value .",
    "however , in the bicone geometry , the sharp cutoff occurs later past the peak photocenter offset .",
    "this difference is caused by the different edge geometry in these models  in the disk and spheroid cases , fewer and fewer materials are located at the far side of the emission region , which is opposite in the bicone case .",
    "another point worth noting is that for inclined blrs , the total line intensity reverberation @xmath80 looks similar in different models , thus does not offer much differentiating power ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the different behaviors in photocenter reverberation @xmath48 for the flattened geometry and for the bicone geometry might be useful in distinguishing the two geometries .    the astrometric reverberation mapping signals vanish when the iso - delay surface is axisymmetric about the @xmath63-axis .",
    "for instance , an edge - on disk will not produce photocenter offset as a function of time delay for the velocity - integrated broad line flux .",
    "fortunately , an astrometric signal will still arise if we have velocity - resolved reverberation mapping : the blue side of the reverberating broad line has a photocenter shifted from that of the red side .",
    "thus the astrometric feature can determine the angular momentum direction of the disk - like blr , while the traditional intensity reverberation mapping is unable to derive such information .",
    "similarly , velocity - resolved reverberation mapping in flux amplitude and in photocenter offset is a powerful tool to further constrain the velocity field of the blr .",
    "below we use the three models to demonstrate the different reverberation behaviors in the blueshifted and redshifted halves of the line profile .",
    "1 .   spheroid models . since we assumed a random maxwellian velocity distribution ,",
    "the red part and blue part of the emission line profile have identical behavior in reverberation signals .",
    "2 .   disk models .",
    "we consider the disk example of @xmath43 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_examp ] . in this case",
    "the redshifted part ( @xmath81 ) and blueshifted part ( @xmath82 ) of the disk will behave exactly the same in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath48 , except that the amplitude of @xmath80 is reduced by half .",
    "however , since we are now looking at half of the disk , the @xmath47 photocenter position of the redshifted / blueshifted disk changes as a function of time , as indicated by the red / blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_vel_examp ] .",
    "bicone outflow models .",
    "we consider the bicone example of @xmath43 and @xmath83 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_examp ] . in this example",
    "the near - side cone has blueshifted velocity while the far - side cone has redshifted velocity then the near / far side of the bicone will also contribute to redshifted / blueshifted velocities . ] .",
    "we plot the results for both cones in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_vel_bicone_examp ] .",
    "the line intensity @xmath45 is already different for the blueshifted half and redshifted half , since the two cones have distinct los velocities : we see intensity reverberation from the blueshifted cone ( near - side ) earlier than the redshifted cone ( far - side ) .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath46 photocenter position is also different for the blueshifted and redshifted cones .",
    "the @xmath47 photocenter positions for the two cones are always zero due to the symmetry of this example .    in the traditional case ,",
    "velocity - resolved intensity rm can effectively distinguish outflow / inflow kinematics from virial motion ( either in a keplerian disk or in randomly orientated orbits ) of the emission line region .",
    "the distinction between the two kinds of kinematics is also clearly reflected in the velocity - resolved astrometric rm , i.e. , the time evolution of the blueshifted and redshifted photocenters is asymmetric in the outflow / inflow case , and symmetric in the case of virial motion ( cf .",
    "figs.[fig : rm_vel_examp ] and [ fig : rm_vel_bicone_examp ] )",
    "the representative examples shown in  [ sec : result ] indicate that the expected astrometric signals are on the order of the blr size . then for typical quasar luminosities of @xmath84 , we expect such astrometric signals to be on the order of tens of @xmath0as at @xmath7 . for more luminous objects and/or at lower redshifts , the expected astrometric signals will be larger . for example",
    ", the quasar 3c 273 ( @xmath85 ) has a measured h@xmath86  blr size of @xmath87light days @xcite , corresponding to @xmath88as at its redshift .",
    "if we further consider reverberation of the dust torus , then the expected astrometric signals would be even larger , e.g. , @xmath89as for quasar luminosities .",
    "the sizes of the blr and torus approximately scale with @xmath2 , thus for seyfert luminosities , @xmath0as astrometric precision might be necessary for astrometric rm .",
    "however , even if the astrometry requirement is fulfilled ( see  [ sec : disc_astro ] ) , there are still several practical issues to consider",
    ". these will affect the target selection and observing strategy for a successful monitoring program .",
    "detailed characterization of the adverse effects and methods to mitigate them are beyond the scope of this paper , and we only give a brief discussion here as a general guideline for future work .",
    "first , the monitoring should be carried out in optical / near - ir to observe the restframe uv to near - ir broad emission lines ( e.g. , civ , , balmer and paschen lines ) and adjacent continua .",
    "tunable narrow - band filters are desired for the broad line imaging and reliable continuum subtraction .",
    "high photometric accuracy is generally required , and to detect and model the astrometric signals we need good cadence of monitoring data .",
    "the monitoring time baseline could span weeks to years , depending on the target .",
    "observations of repeated reverberation events can be combined to provide improved model constraints , as long as the monitoring time span is much shorter than the dynamical timescale ( @xmath90 ) of the blr .",
    "measuring the photocenter of the reverberating part of the blr to the nominal astrometric accuracy poses a more difficult challenge .",
    "it requires the subtraction of the continuum and the steady - state blr emission and subsequent measurement of the photocenter of the variable blr emission without degrading the astrometric accuracy much .",
    "the use of narrow - band filters helps with this procedure , but also increases the integration time to achieve the required photometric precision .",
    "take the broad h@xmath86  line for example , the typical restframe equivalent width is @xmath91(e.g .",
    "thus for a @xmath92  narrow - band filter centered on the redshifted h@xmath86  line at @xmath7 , the enclosed h@xmath86  line flux is @xmath93 of the total flux .",
    "the host galaxy contribution in this bandpass is negligible for quasar luminosities @xmath94 , and reaches @xmath95 of the total continuum at @xmath96 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "with snr@xmath97 for the psf core , @xmath98 fractional changes in the broad line flux can be detected .",
    "however , the centering accuracy of the variable blr emission degrades as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the nominal centering accuracy for the target and @xmath101 is the fraction of the variable flux ( from the reverberating blr ) to the total flux ) . ] .",
    "thus larger amplitudes in the continuum variations ( hence larger reverberation amplitude ) are always favored over smaller amplitudes , just as for traditional intensity rm .",
    "optimal image subtraction methods may be required to isolate the variable blr emission within the bandpass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the real situation may deviate from the idealized case assumed in reverberation mapping , which will inevitably lead to complications . with",
    "better and better rm data sets , however , it is possible to incorporate additional physical ingredients , such as photoionization processes , absorption and scattering , more complex geometry / kinematics , etc .",
    ", in the framework of combined intensity and astrometric rm .",
    "we now discuss realistic timescales for achieving the astrometric precision ( @xmath0as to tens of @xmath0as ) required to detect the astrometric reverberation mapping signals .",
    "such single - epoch astrometric precision is already under serious considerations for ground - based and space - based facilities .",
    "the recent development of ao - assisted , high - angular resolution , near - infrared observations with large , single - aperture telescopes has dramatically improved the astrometry precision .",

    "* ) .    in the study by @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the dominant systematic error is due to atmospheric differential tilt jitter .",
    "this is the stochastic and achromatic fluctuation in the relative displacement of the target and the reference star due to the different columns of atmospheric turbulence traversed by the light from the two objects .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the tilt jitter effect can be largely mitigated by an optimal weighting scheme that uses a grid of reference stars to measure the pair - wise distances from the target .",
    "this optimal estimation technique can essentially reduce the error due to tilt jitter , @xmath106 , below the centering accuracy @xmath100 , which is mostly determined by aperture size , photon noise , and properties of the psf . @xcite",
    "also provided an empirical formula to predict the astrometric performance of a single - conjugate ao system : @xmath107 ^ 2\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left[2\\,{\\rm mas}\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right)^{0.7}\\left(\\frac{5\\,{\\rm m}}{d}\\right)^{7/6}\\right]^2\\bigg\\}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the integration time , @xmath108 is the telescope aperture diameter and @xmath109 is the number of reference stars .",
    "this formula suggests that for 20-minute exposures , the single - measurement precision can achieve @xmath110as for @xmath111m - class telescopes , and @xmath112as for @xmath113m - class telescopes , with only a few reference stars in a @xmath114@xmath115@xmath114  fov .",
    "note that with these large - aperture telescopes and a reasonable amount of exposure time ( e.g. , 30 - 60min ) , the magnitude limit achievable with the above astrometric precision can be as faint as @xmath116 by extrapolation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , relevant for reverberation monitoring of agn continuum and broad line fluxes .    the above estimation might be optimistic .",
    "the actual astrometric performance will inevitably depend on the telescope and ao systems , as well as target properties .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed study on the limiting factors on the astrometry precision for the multi - adaptive optics imaging camera for deep observations ( micado ) proposed for the 42-m european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "the dominant error terms include : instrumental geometric distortion @xmath117as , chromatic atmospheric differential refraction ( cdr ) @xmath118as , atmospheric differential tilt jitter @xmath119as ( with few minutes of integration ) , anisoplanatism of the multi - conjugate ao system @xmath120as , using galaxies as astrometric references in high galactic - latitude fields @xmath121as , and calibration of the projected pixel scale @xmath122as . combining these error terms ,",
    "@xcite estimated a total error budget of @xmath123as . in practice ,",
    "some of these error terms can be reduced .",
    "for instance , @xmath124 can be effectively suppressed if narrow - band filters are used or special algorithms and observing strategies are deployed to correct for the cdr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note that for blr reverberation mapping , it is preferable to use narrow - band filters to cover the emission lines and nearby continuum .",
    "@xmath125 can also be reduced for agn / quasar fields where there are a suitable number of reference stars .",
    "it is also possible to correct instrumental distortion by dedicated calibration procedures to control @xmath126 down to the level of @xmath127as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the range of single - epoch astrometry precision for this particular instrument on e - elt is @xmath128as , although the lower bound would be very challenging to achieve .",
    "we expect similar performance for other 30m - class telescopes .",
    "an alternative route to single - aperture precision astrometry is long - baseline astrometry that operates in the very - narrow - angle regime ( angular separation @xmath129 ) , which uses interferometry in optical / near - ir to achieve high relative astrometric precision ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) instrument is designed to deliver an astrometric precision at the @xmath130as level @xcite . in the short term , however , the astrometric precision is likely limited , by the accuracy in determining the interferometer baseline , to @xmath131as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , current implementation of optical to near - ir interferometry usually requires bright target magnitude @xmath132 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "to summarize , ground - based facilities are promising to deliver @xmath133 tens of @xmath0as single - epoch astrometry precision within a decade or two , and in the most optimal cases , @xmath134as precision .",

    "@xcite is a space - based astrometry mission scheduled to launch in 2013 , which can deliver 150 ( 400)@xmath0as single - measurement astrometric precision for @xmath137 ( 18 ) targets .",
    "this precision is not adequate for astrometric reverberation mapping of the blrs , and barely enough for agn dust torus reverberation .",
    "perhaps the best facility for astrometric agn reverberation mapping is a mission similar to the sim / sim lite mission @xcite , which is capable of achieving @xmath134as single - measurement precision for @xmath138 targets with a space - based 6-m baseline optical interferometer .",
    "in fact probing the @xmath139pc spatial extent of agn / quasar jets and blrs is one of the science cases for this mission , using the same technique as spectroastrometry .",
    "astrometric reverberation mapping would be an ideal application with similar facilities for pointed multi - visit observations , yet with much more constraining power on the blr ( and torus ) geometry and kinematics than spectroastrometry .",
    "although this mission was canceled for the current decade , the technology for such a mission is already in place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in light of the exciting science that will be enabled with @xmath0as astrometry ( especially with the driving force for exoplanet science ) ,",
    "it is reasonable to anticipate similar missions to be approved in the next decade .",
    "in this paper we outlined a simple idea of astrometric reverberation mapping : observing the astrometric `` wobble '' of the blr photocenter in reverberation events .",
    "we demonstrated its potential in constraining the geometry and kinematic structure of the blr with simple blr models .",
    "the virtue of astrometric rm is that it provides an independent set of time series that can be combined with the intensity rm data to constrain the blr model .",
    "in addition , it is more sensitive to the inclination of a disk - like geometry and inference of its angular momentum direction , than intensity rm alone .",
    "although the blr is still unresolved , the spatial information from precision astrometry for the reverberating parts of the blr greatly facilitates using reverberation mapping to probe the blr structure .",
    "once we have a set of high quality continuum and broad line flux monitoring time series with precision photometry and astrometry , we can fit the data in the time domain using model intensity light curves and photocenter evolution .",
    "general markov chain monte carlo approaches with bayesian inference ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be applied to search the parameter space of different model families and to quantify model uncertainties .    while conceptually simple , this method is not yet ready for immediate applications .",
    "we discussed realistic timescales for achieving the required astrometric precision ( @xmath0as to tens of @xmath0as ) , and concluded that ground - based large - aperture telescopes with ao offer the best hope to apply this method to luminous quasars and dust torus rm within a decade or two , and a space - based interferometer ( a sim / sim - lite like mission ) with @xmath0as astrometric precision in the next decade or two may extend this method to the seyfert regime .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the anonymous referee for suggestions that led to improvement of the paper , and brad peterson , chris kochanek and luis ho for useful comments on the draft .",
