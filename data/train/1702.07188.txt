    "the current work was motivated by our previous study @xcite , where stationary pattern formation was observed in experiments with chemical bistable units based on a theory developed for tree ( or tree - like ) networks @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one could expect similar behavior in star network configuration .",
    "however , the previous theories @xcite depend on a description of dynamics using three layers of units . in a star network , only two layers ( center and periphery ) are present and thus prediction of patterns with large number of elements in the nonlinear system provides a challenge .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the formation mechanisms of localized stationary patterns for star networks , where multiple bistable elements are connected to a central hub bistable unit .",
    "this connectivity structure is often found in many natural or engineered systems that consist of dynamical elements interacting with each other through a common medium .",
    "examples include computer networks @xcite and optically coupled semiconductor lasers @xcite where synchronization phenomena have been investigated .",
    "we present a theory that takes advantage of the simplicity of the star network topology to determine the conditions required for the formation of stationary patterns ( without the approximations demanded for the bistable tree networks @xcite ) . using the theory , we determined whether an initial activation will spread , retreat , or remain stationary for a given number of elements connected to the central unit and the strength of those connections .",
    "finally , we designed an electrochemical star network system with bistable reaction units to confirm the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the existence of the network - topology induced stationary patterns .",
    "a simple model for a network organized bistable system can be given by the general form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the amount of the activator in the @xmath2-th network node ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 and the summation term represents the diffusive coupling between the nodes .",

    "when @xmath67 is stable , it corresponds to a steady state that attracts any initial activation found in its basin of attraction .",
    "then , appropriate initial conditions can give rise to stationary patterns localized in the center or the periphery .",
    "however , such a stable point can merge with a saddle point and disappear through a saddle - node bifurcation resulting in a transition from those localized patterns to activation spreading or retreating .",

    "that the coupling strength is proportional to the inverse degree , i.e. , @xmath114 with a value for @xmath115 ms .",
    "similar experiments were performed with a forced active center and passive bistable periphery elements . as shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : expforced](b ) , sufficiently strong coupling results in spreading of the activation from the periphery .",
    "after the initial activation , it takes about 150 to 300 seconds for the periphery elements to reach the active states ( small heterogeneity in the size of the bistable regions could contribute to the different transition times of the different electrodes ) .",

    "[ fig : expgen](a)(c ) with dashed lines , @xmath126 mv is a good approximation of the saddle point as this value is close to the pinned states .",

    "note that this compares very well with the value obtained from the forced activation experiments ( 0.23 ) .",
    "in addition , because the potential was set in the middle of the lower half of the bistability region , we can also approximate value with linear , z - shaped hysteresis , which would give a value of 0.25 . in summary ,",
    "the experimental findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions with a value of nonlinearity parameter @xmath128 .",
    "we have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that bistable star networks support stationary patterns and activation spreading or retreating determined by : the number of coupled elements to the central unit , the coupling strength and the initial conditions .",
    "the theory demonstrates that stationary localized patterns are formed by the pinning of an initial activation .",
    "the qualitative features of the phase diagram corresponding to the pinned , spreading and retreating activations , are the same as those observed for the tree networks although the three - layer approximation used for the trees does not directly apply for the star configurations @xcite . while the qualitative features of the phase diagram are the same ( number of domains and their relative placement ) , there are important quantitative difference between the tree and the star configurations .",
    "for example , at the same nonlinearity parameter , at strong coupling retreating fronts require larger degree networks for star topology than for a tree . similarly , stationary patterns formed by pinned activation states survive stronger coupling with tree networks than with star networks",
    ".    the theoretical predictions were verified by the experiments performed with a complex electrochemical reaction system where multiple bistable elements were connected to a central one .",
    "it should be noted that , although our experimental setup indeed represented a star network of bistable and forced elements , it was not accurately described by the one - component reaction - diffusion model used in the theoretical analysis .",
    "a realistic quantitative model for such electrochemical elements is not yet available , but it should definitely include many chemical components .",
    "it is remarkable , though , that this simple theoretical model ( without kinetic information about the reaction and with a greatly simplified coupling scheme ) is capable of predicting the spatiotemporal dynamics in a complex chemical reaction occurring in star networks .",
    "this study thus complements the previously reported findings for the bistable tree networks @xcite and demonstrates a firm understanding of the generic mechanism where a localized perturbation can trigger the formation of stationary patterns in bistable networks .",

    "<S> weak coupling results in trivial pinned states where the activation can not propagate . at strong coupling , uniform state is expected with active or inactive elements at small or large degree networks respectively . </S>",
    "<S> nontrivial stationary spatial pattern , corresponding to an activation pinning , is predicted to occur at intermediate number of peripheral elements and at intermediate coupling strengths , where the central activation of the network is pinned , but the peripheral activation propagates toward the center . </S>",
    "<S> the results are confirmed in experiments with star networks of bistable electrochemical reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments confirm the existence of the stationary spatial patterns and the dependence of coupling strength on the number of peripheral elements for transitions between pinned and retreating or spreading fronts in forced network configurations ( where the central or periphery elements are forced to maintain their states ) . </S>"
