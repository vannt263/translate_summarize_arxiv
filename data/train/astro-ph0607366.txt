    "it has been found that the isotropic equivalent energy of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is correlated with the peak energy of their integrated spectra , with only a few outliers @xcite @xmath4 the peak energy @xmath1 is defined to be the photon energy at the peak of the grb spectrum @xmath5 , converted to the rest frame of the grb .",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath0 is defined in the @xmath6@xmath7 kev band in the grb frame .    with a sample of 41 grbs with firmly determined redshifts and peak spectral energy ,",
    "@xcite has found that @xmath8 and @xmath9 erg ( @xmath1 in kev ) .",
    "the spread of the grbs in the sample ( 1-@xmath3 width ) around the best fit model is given by @xmath10 , or equivalently , @xmath11 .",
    "that is , the uncertainty in the isotropic equivalent energy predicted by the relation in  ( [ amati ] ) is about a factor of 2 .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 correlation  ( [ amati ] ) is often called the amati relation . a statistical analysis based on the correlation between the intensity and the peak spectral energy of grbs with unknown redshifts carried out by @xcite before the discovery of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation @xcite has predicted the existence of such a relation and has indicated that it is a physical relation rather than a superficial relation .",
    "the correlation is even better when the correction to the grb energy from the jet collimation is included @xcite .",
    "however , this is achieved with a great price : the grb jet opening angle is involved and hence the application of the relation requires multi - band observations on the afterglow as well as a knowledge on the jet model and the grb environment parameters .",
    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , a sub - class of grbs that are characterized by a large fluence in the x - ray energy band relative to the gamma - ray energy band @xcite , are found to satisfy the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "they include the extremely soft grb 020903 @xcite and the recently discovered supernova - connected grb 060218 @xcite .",
    "outliers to the @xmath0@xmath1 relation do exist .",
    "short - duration grbs are often found to violate the relation . among long - duration bursts ,",
    "famous outliers are grb 980425 and grb 031203 @xcite , both are sub - energetic and have spectroscopically confirmed supernovae accompanying them . @xcite and @xcite have argued that a significant fraction of the long - duration grbs detected by batse on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) must violate the amati relation .    however , it has been claimed that grb 031203 had a significant soft x - ray component not seen by the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _",
    "( _ integral _ ) , which may make grb 031203 consistent with the amati relation by reducing the value of its @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this idea becomes particularly attractive after grb 060218 , which had a prompt emission directly detected in both gamma - ray and x - ray bands , lasting about 2,000 seconds .",
    "it has motivated @xcite to propose that grb 980425 and grb 031203 are twins of grb 060218 and they indeed satisfy the amati relation",
    ".    given its universality and simplicity , the amati relation might be considered as a good redshift or distance estimator for grbs .",
    "in fact , it has already been claimed by amati ( 2006 ) that the relation can be the most reliable redshift estimator .",
    "since it only involves the prompt emission of the grb , one may hope that the amati relation can be applied to grbs at very high redshift .    however , in this _ letter _ , we show that it is impossible to use the @xmath0@xmath1 relation to estimate the redshift of a grb at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "this is because of the fact that there is an intrinsic redshift degeneracy in the amati relation , which causes more problems in determining the redshift than the dispersion in the relation .",
    "the degeneracy arises from the definition of the amati relation and the fact that every empirical relation in astronomy has a nonzero intrinsic dispersion .",
    "the existence of the redshift degeneracy makes it impossible to distinguish grb redshifts in the range of @xmath13@xmath14 , if 1-@xmath3 error is allowed .    throughout the _ letter _ , we adopt a cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",

    "the isotropic equivalent energy of the grb , defined in the grb frame , is related to the observed bolometric fluence of the grb by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bolometric fluence , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the luminosity distance and the comoving distance of the grb .",
