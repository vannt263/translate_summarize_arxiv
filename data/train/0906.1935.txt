    "electromagnetic ( em ) form factors are important observable parameters to probe the inner structure of the baryon and eventually understand the strong interaction @xcite .",

    "the experiments show that data of the electric form factor from the polarization transfer technique decrease faster than the dipole law for squared momentum transfer @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , there were a lot of studies on the em form factors of the nucleon in the past years .",
    "the recent status of the development can be found in ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "nevertheless , investigations on the em form factors of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons are much less than that of the nucleon as there are no experimental data available , so further theoretical study on this issue is needed in order to understand the internal structure of these baryons .    among the various theoretical investigations on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , chiral perturbation theory and the chiral quark / soliton model",
    "have been used to study the em form factors at low momentum transfer @xcite ; the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have studied the electric and magnetic form factors of these baryons in the relativistic constituent quark model .",
    "we have given the distribution amplitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which makes it possible to use the light cone sum rule ( lcsr ) approach to study the em form factors of these baryons @xcite .",
    "lcsr is a nonperturbative method which includes both the traditional qcd sum rule @xcite and the hard exclusive process theory @xcite .",
    "it has been widely used to investigate the hadronic dynamics related to strong interaction @xcite .    in our previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the em form factors of the baryons using the interpolating currents provided by chernyak and zhitnitsky ( cz current ) @xcite in the framework of lcsr .",
    "it has been known that the hadron interpolating field is one of the most important ingredients in nonperturbative field - theoretic investigations . as three - body composite particles ,",
    "baryons have several independent interpolating currents with the same quantum numbers .",
    "particularly , for baryons with spin @xmath3 , there are two independent interpolating fields with no derivatives @xcite .",
    "linear compositions of these two interpolators have been investigated for both light and heavy baryons within qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the author of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the mixing of the two kinds of currents may affect the results for the nucleon . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the choice of the currents affects the em form factors greatly in the case of the nucleon .",
    "thus it is expected that different interpolating currents may give information on different aspects of the same process .",
    "the aims of the present paper are to study the em form factors of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons at moderately large momentum transfer in lcsr with the choice of the ioffe type interpolating current @xcite , and to estimate the magnetic moments from the magnetic form factors obtained .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to derive the light cone sum rules of the em form factors for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is the numerical analysis part .",
    "summary and conclusion are given at the end of this section .",
    "appendix [ appendix ] presents the distribution amplitudes of the baryons .",
    "the most general expressions of spin @xmath3 baryonic em form factors are defined by the matrix element of the em currents between baryon states : @xmath4b(p , s),\\label{form}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are dirac and pauli form factors , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the baryon spinor with momentum @xmath8 and spin @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the baryon mass , @xmath11 is the squared momentum transfer , and @xmath12 is the em current relevant to the baryon . experimentally speaking ,",
    "the dirac and pauli form factors can also be expressed by the magnetic and electric sachs form factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 which describe the distributions of the magnetic current and the electric charge in the breit frame . in particular , the normalization of these form factors at the point @xmath16 is given by the baryon magnetic moment and electric charge .",
    "we have ever studied the em form factors of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons in ref .",
    "@xcite using the following cz current : @xmath17\\gamma_5\\!\\not\\ ! z s^j(x),\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the quark fields , @xmath20 is the charge conjugation operator and @xmath21 is a light - cone vector which satisfies @xmath22 . the coupling of this current determines the normalization of the leading twist distribution amplitudes .",
    "however , as mentioned in the above section , the choice of the baryonic interpolating current may affect the results of sum rules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a usage of different interpolating currents in the lcsr application makes a complement for the theoretical analysis . in this regard",
    ", we adopt the interpolating field similarly as that used for the nucleon by ioffe @xcite to study the em form factors of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling constant of the ioffe type current determines the normalization of higher order twist distribution amplitudes @xcite .",
    "in fact , only axial vector ( vector ) structures contribute to the sum rules for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) with the usage of cz current , while the application of ioffe type current may include contributions from both vector like and axial vector like distribution amplitudes .",
    "hence it is of interest to investigate the em form factors by lcsr with the ioffe type interpolating current , which is expected to approve our theoretical analysis and give new information for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons .",
    "following the standard philosophy in lcsr , the procedure begins with the correlation function : @xmath23 where the interpolating current of the @xmath0 baryon field is chosen as ioffe type one : @xmath24 and the coupling constant is defined by the matrix element of the interpolating current between the vacuum and the @xmath0 state : @xmath25 in which @xmath10 is the mass of the baryon .",
    "the em current is @xmath26    the derivation of the sum rules needs to express the correlation function ( [ correlator1 ] ) both phenomenologically and theoretically . on the one hand , by inserting a complete set of intermediate states with the same quantum numbers as those of @xmath0 , using the definitions of eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , the hadronic representation of the correlation function is written as @xmath27\\lambda(p)+ ... ,\\label{hadrep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the dots stand for the higher resonance contributions . here",
    "we contract the correlation function with the light - cone vector @xmath30 to get rid of contributions proportional to @xmath30 which are subdominant on the light cone .",
    "on the other hand , the correlation function can be expanded on the light cone at large euclidean momenta @xmath31 and @xmath32 in terms of the distribution amplitudes which are presented in appendix [ appendix ] . as the usual procedure",
    ", the hadronic representation of the correlation function is matched with the qcd calculations on the light - cone to obtain the sum rules .",
    "the correlation function ( [ correlator1 ] ) contains several lorenz structures ( as in eq.([hadrep ] ) ) , and in principle all of them can provide information of the em form factors . in the paper , terms proportional to @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen to obtain the related form factors . after taking advantage of the dispersion relation and the hadron - quark duality approach ,",
    "the light - cone qcd sum rules are given as the following borel transformed version : @xmath35 and the sum rule for @xmath6 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the borel parameter , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 connects with the continuum threshold @xmath41 : @xmath42 the following notations are used for convenience : @xmath43 where @xmath44 these terms come from the partial integration on @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which is employed to eliminate the factors @xmath48 in the calculation .",
    "this subsection is reserved for lcsrs of the @xmath49 em form factors .",
    "the process for @xmath50 is similar and we only list the numerical analysis .",
    "the calculation begins with the following correlation function : @xmath51 where the electromagnetic current is @xmath52 and the interpolating current is @xmath53\\gamma_5\\gamma^\\mu s^k(x),\\ ] ] with the coupling constant @xmath54 .",
    "following the same procedure as that in the above subsection , the sum rules are given as @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the following notations are used for convenience : @xmath59 in which the functions with a tilde are defined the same as those in the above subsection .",
    "determination of the nonperturbative parameters of the distribution amplitudes can be carried out in qcd sum rules .",
    "the parameters have been estimated in the previous work @xcite . here",
    "we only list the central values of the parameters .",
    "for @xmath0 the sum rules give the central values of the two parameters as @xmath60 for @xmath1 the results are : @xmath61      the choices of other input parameters appeared in the sum rules are as follows : the threshold is set to be @xmath62 for @xmath1 and @xmath63 for @xmath0 , while the mass of the hadrons are the central values provided by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is known that in the numerical analysis of the sum rules , the auxiliary borel parameter should have a proper region in which the physical value varies mildly with it . at the same time , the choice of the working window needs to suppress both the higher resonance and higher twist contributions . to exhibit the working window ,",
    "the magnetic form factors versus the borel parameter at different points of the momentum transfer @xmath2 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( for @xmath1 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( for @xmath0 ) , from which we can see that the form factors are almost independent of the borel parameter in the range @xmath67 .    hereafter , the borel parameter is set to be @xmath68 in the numerical analysis . in refs .",
    "@xcite , van cauteren @xmath69 @xmath70 have given the magnetic and electric form factors of strange baryons in the range @xmath71 .",
    "correspondingly , we plot the @xmath2-dependent magnetic and electric form factors of the @xmath1 baryons in the range @xmath72 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in comparison with their results ,",
    "the form factors from our approach are in accordance with theirs except the electric form factor of @xmath49 , for it changes sign at some momentum transfer in their result . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the normalization of the magnetic and electric form factors at point @xmath16 is given by the magnetic moment and the electric charge , respectively .",
    "however , in our frame , we can not give the behaviors of the form factors at this point directly due to the limit of lcsr method itself .",
    "for a comparison with the results obtained from chiral quark / soliton model @xcite , in which the behaviors of the baryon electromagnetic form factors are given in the range @xmath73 , one can see that our results agree with theirs qualitatively due to the accordance at the point @xmath74 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the magnetic form factors approach zero with the increase of the momentum transfer , which leads to the assumption that the magnetic form factors can be described by the dipole formula : @xmath75 where @xmath76 corresponds to the baryon magnetic moment . to test our calculation",
    ", we estimate the magnetic moments of the baryons from the sum rules .",
    "the similar process is adopted as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the magnetic form factor is fitted by the formula @xmath77 in the sum rule allowed range @xmath72 , and the magnetic moments are estimated from the fits .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is the dipole formula fit of the magnetic form factor @xmath13 for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the numerical estimations are : @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the physical value @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the analysis",
    "the magnetic moment is from the pdg @xcite : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the other parameter @xmath83 is the central value from the dipole formula fit that is @xmath84 for @xmath49 and @xmath85 for @xmath50 .",
    "the same process is carried out for the @xmath0 baryon .",
    "the analysis shows that unlike results from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the magnetic moment can be well estimated from the fit , the magnetic form factor obtained with the adoption of the ioffe type current fails to be fitted by the dipole formula assumption .",
    "herein we only present the @xmath2-dependence of the magnetic and electric form factors in fig .",
    "the magnetic form factor is plotted in the left one , in which the dashed line is the dipole formula fit from ref .",
    "the figure shows that the magnetic form factor approaches zero faster than the dipole formula with the increase of @xmath2 , which is different from the results of the nucleon from the polarization technic experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , we give the physical value @xmath86 on the momentum transfer @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where the parameters used in the dipole formula are chosen as follows : the magnetic moment is from pdg that is @xmath87 and the other parameter @xmath83 is from the previous work @xcite : @xmath88 .",
    "one can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that the dipole formula assumption fails to describe the magnetic form factor .",
    "we list results from the two different interpolating currents in table [ tab ] , from which we can see that the adoption of the ioffe type current is good for the estimation of the magnetic moment of @xmath50 but fails to estimate that of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the utilization of the cz current gives a good estimation on the @xmath0 magnetic moment .",
    "more accurate estimation of the magnetic moments of the baryons needs to consider the higher order conformal spin corrections to the distribution amplitudes .",
    "besides the effect from the choice of the interpolating current , the higher order qcd coupling @xmath89 corrections may affect the result to some extent .",

    "the magnetic form factors are fitted by the dipole formula , from which the magnetic moments of the baryons are estimated as : @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in comparison with the previous work @xcite",
    ", the dipole formula assumption has a good estimation for @xmath50 , but fails to estimate the magnetic moment of @xmath0 .",
    "this may partly lie in the fact that the vector like structures of the @xmath0 distribution amplitudes can play more important roles in the calculations with the choice of the ioffe type current , which needs to consider higher order conformal spin corrections .",
    "it can be concluded that the magnetic form factor of @xmath0 from the ioffe type current approaches zero faster than that of the dipole formula with the momentum transfer @xmath2 .",
    "future experiments are expected to test the calculations and give us more information on the electromagnetic form factors .",

    "all the functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 depend on the scalar product @xmath100 .",
