    "the extended high - energy emission detected by fermi / lat is widely believed to arise from the electrons accelerated in the external  forward shock via the synchrotron radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the maximum photon energy in this scenario is limited to be @xmath3mev , where @xmath4 mev is the maximum synchrotron photon in the rest frame of the shock and @xmath5 is the bulk lorentz factor of the shock , which is usually @xmath6 at @xmath7s after the trigger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so the detection of @xmath1gev photons after 100 s poses a challenge for the synchrotron emission scenario @xcite .",
    "considering the above difficulty , @xcite recently proposed that the afterglow synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission or external inverse - compton of central x - ray emission @xcite is likely responsible for the late - time @xmath1gev photons seen in some lat grbs .",
    "grb 130427a triggered the _",
    "fermi_/gbm with a fluence of @xmath8erg@xmath9 in 10 - 1000 kev within a duration of @xmath10s @xcite . it was later localized at @xmath11 @xcite , implying an isotropic energy of @xmath12erg @xcite .",
    "unprecedentedly , @xmath13mev emissions are detected well beyond the prompt emission phase up to about one day after the burst , including fifteen @xmath1gev photons detected up to @xmath14s and one 95.3gev photon arrived at 243s after the trigger @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that these late - time high - energy photons may arise from inverse - compton processes @xcite .",
    "further evidence comes from the presence of a hard spectral component ( the photon index @xmath15 ) above @xmath16gev @xcite in the late afterglow , which has signatures well consistent with the prediction of the afterglow synchrotron self - compton emission @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we will verify this possibility by modeling the multi - band ( from radio to gev bands ) data of this burst .",
    "hereafter , we denote by @xmath17 the value of the quantity @xmath18 in units of @xmath19 .",
    "in the standard synchrotron afterglow spectrum , there are three break frequencies , i.e. @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are caused by synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) , electron injection and electron cooling respectively . according to ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , these three characteristic frequencies are given by    @xmath23    @xmath24    and @xmath25 in the case that @xmath26 , which is usually true under typical parameter values . in the above three equations",
    ", @xmath27 is the time in the observer s frame since the trigger time , @xmath28 is the redshift of the burst , @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the electron index , @xmath31 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the grb outflow and @xmath32 is the number density of the circumburst medium . for an interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "circumburst environment , @xmath32 is a constant while for a stellar wind circumburst environment , it is inversely proportional to the square of the shock radius . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the equipartition factors for the energy in electrons and magnetic field in the shock respectively . in the expression of @xmath22",
    ", @xmath35 is the compton parameter evaluating the effect of ssc cooling on the synchrotron spectrum . in the thomson scattering limit , @xmath36 @xcite if @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is obtained by considering only the synchrotron cooling .    the time",
    " integrated spectrum of high  energy emission from grb  130427a can be modeled by a broken power - law with a soft component ( @xmath39 ) below the break energy @xmath40gev and a hard component ( @xmath41 ) above @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that synchrotron emission is dominant below @xmath42 while the ssc emission is dominant above @xmath42 . as @xcite , we assume @xmath43 in the following analysis .",
    "thus , the synchrotron flux at @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the luminosity distance .",
    "here we neglect the inverse - compton cooling for the electrons that radiate high - energy gamma - ray emission due to the deep klein  nishina ( kn ) scattering effect@xcite .",
    "the emission above @xmath42 can be interpreted as the ssc emission in the regime of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the corresponding break frequencies in the ssc spectrum .",
    "the ssc flux is given by @xcite @xmath50    lower energy emission is produced by the forward shock synchrotron radiation .",
    "x - ray observation frequency is usually also in the fast cooling regime , i.e. @xmath51 . but the kn suppression effect is not as important as in the case of @xmath13mev emission , so we need to consider the effect of ssc cooling on the synchrotron spectrum carefully .",
    "thus , we have @xmath52^{-1}\\\\ & \\times(1+z)^{1.05}d_{l,28}^{-2}t^{-1.15}\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{10\\,\\rm kev}\\right)^{-1.1 } \\rm mjy \\end{split}\\ ] ] here @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the compton parameter in the thomson scattering limit as mentioned above , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the energy density of synchrotron radiation field and magnetic field respectively . the factor @xmath57 considers the kn effect on the electrons that emit @xmath58kev photons by synchrotron radiation . in the thomson scattering regime @xmath59 , while in the deep kn scattering regime @xmath60",
    ".    the kn effect will intervene in the inverse compton cooling if the energy of the incident photon exceeds the rest energy of the scattering electron in its rest frame , i.e. , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the lorentz factor of the electron in the comoving frame of the emitting region and @xmath63 is the critical frequency of the incidence photon measured in the observer s frame .",
    "if the energy of a photon is larger than @xmath64 , the scatter will enter the kn regime with a suppressed cross section .",
    "the lorentz factor of the electron emitting x - ray photons can be given by @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 as @xmath67 , the kn suppression effect becomes more and more important at later time .",
    "as a rough estimate , @xmath57 can be given by @xmath68 in a broad parameter space , we find @xmath69 , leading to @xmath70^{0.8}(\\frac{h\\nu}{10\\rm kev})^{0.2}t^{-0.1}$ ] .",
    "optical emission is typically in the frequency regime @xmath71 , so the flux is given by @xmath72 the radio observation frequency could lie in the regime @xmath73 or @xmath74 . in the former case , @xmath75 while in the latter case , @xmath76    we note that in previous works , modeling of the multi - band light curves of lat - detected grbs usually result in a low circumburst density @xmath77 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a low - density environment",
    ", ssc flux would be severely suppressed .",
    "we here point out that the low - density result is mainly due to neglect of the kn effect in modeling the x - ray afterglows .",
    "we now briefly show that considering the kn effect in x - ray afterglow can change the inferred density dramatically .",
    "usually @xmath1gev data are not available , and only @xmath13mev , x - ray , optical and radio data are used in the multi - band light curve fit .",
    "so from eqs .",
    "( [ 100mev ] ) , ( [ x_ray ] ) , ( [ opt ] ) , and ( [ radio1 ] ) or ( [ radio2 ] ) , we get four independent constraints on four undetermined parameters , namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( note that @xmath43 is fixed ) .",
    "so we can fully determine these parameters by solving these equations .",
    "in the case that kn effect is not considered in x - ray emission , i.e. , @xmath59 , we get @xmath80 here we adopt the case that @xmath81 for radio flux as an example .",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants related to data used to normalize the flux in lat , x - ray , optical , radio band respectively .",
    "when considering the kn effect in x - ray , as long as @xmath86 , we can approximately replace the @xmath83 by @xmath87 in the above equation set and we then get @xmath88 here we denote the parameters without considering the kn effect on x - ray emission by hatted characters .",
    "if @xmath89 , @xmath57 should be replaced by @xmath90 in the above equation set . since @xmath91 , considering the kn effect in x - ray emission will increases the inferred ism density significantly . substituting eq .",
    "( [ kn_nokn ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 10gev ] ) , we find @xmath92 , so the ssc flux can be significantly increased as well .",
    "here we would like to point out that eq .",
    "( [ fkn ] ) underestimates the value of @xmath57 because the scattering cross section in the kn regime is approximated as being zero . in our numerical code",
    ", we calculate @xmath57 as @xmath93(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\rm kn}})^{-1}f_\\nu d\\nu}{\\int_0^{\\infty}f_\\nu   d\\nu},\\ ] ] where the expression before @xmath94 in the second integration on the numerator accounts for the correction to the scattering cross section above @xmath63 .",
    "there are abundant observational data of the multi - band light curves of grb  130427a .",
    "the extended high - energy emission in the energy range 0.1 - 2 gev and 2 - 100gev shows a power - law decay with slopes of @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore we adopt the ism density profile for the circumburst environment , because in the wind environment , the late - time ssc flux would decrease much faster than the observed one . , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . while in the wind medium , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so @xmath101    according to the fermi / lat spectral data shown in @xcite , the 0.1 - 2gev flux is dominated by the synchrotron component . requiring the synchrotron flux",
    "be @xmath102ph@xmath9s@xmath103 at 300s , we obtain @xmath104 and , by requiring the ssc flux be @xmath105ph@xmath9s@xmath103 at 5000s in 2 - 100gev , we obtain @xmath106    the xrt data show that the x - ray flux decay with a slope of -1.2 since 421s after the trigger , then breaks at 53.4ks to a steeper slope of -1.8 @xcite , and after @xmath107day the light curve becomes shallower again with a slope of -1.3 .",
    "the first slope is consistent with the decay of the synchrotron flux when the observation frequency is above the cooling frequency , i.e. @xmath108 . to explain the second slope , we introduce a jet break around 53.4ks .",
    "the late - time shallower decay could be due to the kn suppression effect which becomes more and more important at later times . since the kn effect is not easy to express accurately in an analytical way",
    ", we include it in the numerical modeling .",
    "the optical flux decreases slowly at early time with a slope of -0.8@xcite , which is consistent with the decay slope of synchrotron emission in the frequency regime @xmath109 .",
    "the light curve becomes obviously steeper after @xmath110day with a slope of -1.35 @xcite and then a flattening shows up at @xmath111days after the trigger@xcite .",
    "the steepening in the light curve can be ascribed to the jet break as well .",
    "although the jet break usually results in a steeper slope than -1.35 , we note that there is an emerging supernova component @xcite , so this shallow slope could be caused by the superposition of the fast decaying synchrotron afterglow component and the supernova component . since the r - band flux is about 1mjy at @xmath112ks , we have @xmath113    the radio data starts from @xmath114day after the trigger @xcite , which is around the assumed jet break time . the observed 5ghz flux at 0.67day and 2days after the trigger are comparable , and decreases by a factor of a few at 4.7days .",
    "this decay can be ascribed to the jet break .",
    "higher frequency observations such as @xmath115ghz , @xmath116ghz start later and show a decaying light curve from the beginning . by requiring that the synchrotron flux at 5ghz flux be 2mjy at 0.67day ,",
    "we get @xmath117 the early radio emission can be also attributed to the reverse shock emission , as suggested by @xcite with @xmath118 ) at 2days and 4.7days after the trigger time . on the other hand",
    ", we also note that radio observations during early time ( e.g. , < 10days after the trigger time ) may suffer from the interstellar scintillation @xcite , so the observed flux and spectral index could be affected to some extent . ] .",
    "then we will require that the flux produced by the forward shock is below the observed flux .",
    "this is possible in the framework of the decaying micro - turbulence magnetic field scenario @xcite , since the radio - emitting electrons radiate in a weaker magnetic field region .",
    "as we can see , the early and late time lat observations , the optical and the radio observations already provide four independent constraints on four parameters ( i.e. , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath78 and @xmath119 ) . since the x - ray observation can in principle put another constraint independently , the system of equations is overdetermined .",
    "finding a solution for the overdetermined system of equations supports the validity of our model .    by solving the above four equations , we get @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "although the analytic solution and numerical solution may not conform each other perfectly , we can use these values as a guide , and fine - tune them to get a good global solution in our numerical code .",
    "we show the fitting of multi - band light curves in fig .",
    "the final values of the parameters are not much different from the above values , as shown in the caption of the figure .",
    "we also present the light curve of @xmath13gev ssc emission with a purple dashed line .",
    "it peaks around 100s with a flux of @xmath124ph@xmath9s@xmath103 .",
    "given the lat effective area of @xmath125@xmath9 , one expect that lat may detect one @xmath126gev photon in @xmath127s around the peak time , which is consistent with the detection of the @xmath128gev photon at 243s after the trigger time .",
    "our model can not explain the high energy emission during the prompt emission phase ( @xmath129s ) , which is attributed to the internal dissipation origin @xcite .",
    "in the numerical modeling , we find that @xmath130 gradually decreases from @xmath131 at @xmath132s to @xmath133 at @xmath134s .",
    "[ spectrum ] presents the fit of the time - integrated spectrum of lat emission for the period of @xmath135 s and @xmath136 s.",
    "the extended , hard emission above a few gev , seen in grb 130427a , represents strong evidence of a ssc component in the forward shock emission .",
    "the appearance of the ssc component implies that the circumburst density should not be too low , in contrast to the result in the previous study that the circumburst density of lat  detected bursts is on average lower than usual @xcite .",
    "the inferred density in this work is of the same order of the typical ism density in the galaxy disk where massive stars reside .",
    "recently , @xcite modeled the low - energy afterglows of this grb with a forward - reverse shock synchrotron emission model . however , we find that their model predicts a synchrotron flux about one order of magnitude lower than the observed flux in the lat energy range . to interpret the multi - band afterglow data including the lat data , we proposed a forward shock synchrotron plus ssc emission scenario .",
    "we also find that an ism environment is favored by the slow decay of 2100gev flux , which is explained as the ssc origin .",
