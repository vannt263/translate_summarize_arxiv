    "in first order formulations of general relativity one has a notion of local lorentz invariance , which can be thought of as one way of implementing the equivalence principle .",
    "it is crucial to understand the fate of this gauge symmetry in attempts to quantise gravity , both theoretically and with regard to a possible phenomenology of quantum gravity ( including matter ) .",
    "there are strong experimental constraints on many possible types of violation of lorentz covariance and any proposed theory of quantum gravity must prove itself consistent with such constraints .    in hamiltonian formulations , in particular the ashtekar - barbero connection formulation @xcite ,",
    "the issue of lorentz covariance has been the focus of some debate , since the ashtekar - barbero formulation naturally uses the gauge group @xmath0 or @xmath2 is required if one wants to include spinors .",
    "we consider pure gravity ; the symmetry groups we discuss arise as the isometry groups of real manifolds or the stabilisers of points in them , and can be taken to be real - valued matrix groups . by expressions such as @xmath1 , we mean the connected component preserving orientation and time orientation .",
    "] , instead of the full lorentz group .",
    "the use of this smaller gauge group is connected to the appearance of second - class constraints in previous attempts to maintain full lorentz covariance .",
    "here we show how to avoid second class constraints and stay lorentz covariant by introducing a field of _ local observers_. details are given in the paper @xcite .",
    "starting from the lorentz covariant palatini - holst action for vacuum general relativity without cosmological constant s[e,]=_abcde^ae^br^cd [ ] , [ palholst ] where @xmath3 is an @xmath1-invariant bilinear form on @xmath4 , _",
    "abcd=_abcd+(_ac_bd-_ad_bc ) , one can perform the usual canonical analysis and find that the 18 momenta @xmath5 conjugate to the spatial components of the connection @xmath6 are expressible in terms of only 12 tetrad components @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to _ second class constraints _ , which provide an obstacle to quantisation and usually require introducing new variables which are harder to interpret in terms of spacetime geometry .    in holst",
    "s analysis @xcite leading to the well - known ashtekar - barbero formulation of canonical gravity , one deals with this issue by explicit symmetry breaking to @xmath2 : imposing ` time gauge ' @xmath8 and defining a^ab=^ab+_cd^cd , only the @xmath9 part of @xmath10 ( the _ ashtekar - barbero connection _ ) has nonvanishing conjugate momentum , and one avoids second class constraints .",
    "however , this comes at the price of losing lorentz symmetry which is broken explicitly by the gauge choice .    in our formalism",
    "we replace time gauge by a condition involving a field of _ internal observers _",
    "@xmath11 which specifies a time direction locally , and leads to a spontaneous breaking of symmetry from @xmath1 to a subgroup @xmath12 depending on @xmath13 at each spacetime point @xmath14 .",
    "for a given spacetime manifold with metric @xmath15 or frame field @xmath16 , we define a _ field of observers _ as a unit future - directed timelike vector field @xmath17 . using the frame field",
    "we can map it to a spacetime scalar @xmath18 valued in the velocity hyperboloid @xmath19 .",
    "but such a field of _ internal observers _ can be defined without specifying the metric , and is hence suitable for a framework in which the metric arises dynamically as a solution to the equations of motion .    our formalism for _ generalised canonical gravity",
    "_ builds on the following variables :    * a field of internal observers @xmath11 , valued in @xmath20 , thought of as giving a local notion of time direction , * a nowhere - vanishing 1-form @xmath21 , thought of as non - dynamical and generalising the normal to a foliation ( if @xmath22 , @xmath21 is of the form @xmath23 )  one can always reduce to the case of a foliation by choosing an appropriate @xmath21 , * an @xmath24-valued ` triad ' 1-form @xmath25 , where @xmath24 is the subspace of @xmath26 orthogonal to @xmath11 ( this generalises time gauge ) .",
    "the spacetime coframe field is then simply given by e = e+y [ one ] analogous to how one reconstructs the spacetime metric in the adm formulation using lapse and shift . as is usual in first order gravity , we must require @xmath16 to be nondegenerate .",
    "the field of internal observers @xmath11 defines a field of spacetime observers by @xmath18 , and one finds that @xmath27 so that @xmath25 is actually _",
    "spatial_.    similarly , we define spatial and temporal parts of the spin connection , = + [ two ] substituting ( [ one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) into the palatini - holst action ( [ palholst ] ) gives us a generalised hamiltonian formulation of vacuum general relativity in terms of an action depending on @xmath28 and @xmath29 that we give in @xcite . up to this stage",
    "everything is lorentz covariant  we have just changed variables in the action .",
    "the rle of the field of internal observers @xmath11 is to give us a local embedding of @xmath2 into @xmath1 .",
    "the embedding can be freely changed by applying a lorentz transformation @xmath30 ; allowing those lorentz transformations instead of thinking of @xmath11 as fixed restores lorentz covariance .",
    "the spatial connection @xmath31 can be projected to its @xmath32 part @xmath33 . then under a local lorentz transformation ",
    "= ^-1**+_y(^-1d^ ) , where @xmath34 is a projector onto @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a spatial exterior derivative . therefore ,",
    "if one only applies @xmath12 transformations which leave @xmath11 invariant , @xmath33 transforms as an @xmath12 connection , while if one allows for transformations that rotate the local internal observer @xmath11 to @xmath37 , the transformed connection @xmath38 is in @xmath35 .",
    "this is as it should be .",
    "to understand the dynamical structure of this formalism , we focus on the term in the action that determines the symplectic structure in hamiltonian general relativity , s=_abcde^ae^b_u^cd+  since @xmath39 is valued only in @xmath32 , only half of the components of @xmath31 have nonvanishing conjugate momentum .",
    "the number of independent components of @xmath25 matches the number of conjugate momenta , and no second - class constraints arise  but we did not find it necessary to impose any gauge fixing such as the time gauge employed in holst s analysis .",
    "one can make the splitting of @xmath4 into a rotational subalgebra @xmath32 and a complement @xmath40 explicit by choosing local bases @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( depending on @xmath11 ) .",
    "then a^i:=**^i+k^i , [ ashbarb ] is conjugate to @xmath43 , where @xmath33 and @xmath44 are the @xmath32 and @xmath40 parts of @xmath31 .",
    "( [ ashbarb ] ) is the ashtekar - barbero connection , and our formalism is dynamically equivalent to the ashtekar - barbero formulation : it has the same phase space variables , subject to the same constraints that define the dynamics . in the form ( [ ashbarb ] )",
    "manifest lorentz covariance is lost ; it can be recovered by viewing @xmath32 and @xmath40 not as fixed ( isomorphic ) representations of @xmath2 , but as subspaces of @xmath4 specified by the field @xmath11 .",
    "situations of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gravitational theories are geometrically best understood in terms of _ cartan geometry _ @xcite .",
    "a well - known example is the macdowell - mansouri formulation @xcite of gravity with cosmological constant ( we take @xmath45 but @xmath46 is analogous ) in terms of the @xmath47 invariant action s_mm = -_abcde(f^abf^cd)y^e , [ macdo ] where @xmath48 is the curvature of an @xmath47 connection @xmath10 .",
    "the field @xmath11 takes values in de sitter spacetime @xmath49 ; it breaks the symmetry at each point in spacetime to the subgroup @xmath50 leaving @xmath11 invariant .",
    "fixing @xmath51 in the action breaks the symmetry explicitly .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath52 splits into a subalgebra @xmath53 and a complement @xmath54 ; identifying the @xmath53 part of @xmath10 with the spin connection @xmath55 and the @xmath54 part with a coframe @xmath16 , a = (    c c & e + -e & 0    ) , [ cartanco ] the action ( [ macdo ] ) reduces to the einstein - hilbert - palatini action with a cosmological term .",
    "cartan geometry is about infinitesimally approximating the geometry of a curved manifold by a homogeneous spacetime @xmath56 ( in this case de sitter spacetime ) which generalises the tangent space @xmath57 used in ( pseudo-)riemannian geometry .",
    "the cartan connection @xmath10 relates the model spacetimes tangent to different points of the manifold  for a model spacetime of non - zero curvature , @xmath10 is flat if the manifold is ( locally ) isomorphic to the model spacetime .",
    "this naturally introduces a cosmological constant into gravity , given by the curvature scale of the model spacetime .",
    "our reformulation of the ashtekar - barbero formalism for canonical gravity is best interpreted as describing the geometry of _ space _ as _ cartan geometrodynamics _ : the @xmath32 connection @xmath33 ( or , alternatively , the ashtekar - barbero connection ) and the triad @xmath25 can be assembled into a cartan connection = (    c c * * & e + 0 & 0    ) , [ cartangeo ] taking values in the lie algebra of the euclidean group @xmath58 if we consider a vanishing cosmological constant ( @xmath59 is an ( unspecified ) length scale put in for dimensional reasons ) .",
    "the appearance of the group @xmath60 is understood as follows : spacetime is infinitesimally modelled on minkowski spacetime , with isometry group @xmath61 . at a given point in spacetime , picking an observer in the model minkowski spacetime gives a notion of ` space ' in the model spacetime as the maximal totally geodesic hypersurface orthogonal to this observer  in the construction above , we referred to this as the subspace @xmath24 orthogonal to an observer @xmath11 .",
    "this breaks the symmetry to @xmath60 , the isometry group of @xmath24 . picking a point in @xmath24 tangent to the spacetime point",
    "then breaks the symmetry further to @xmath2 , giving the splitting ( [ cartangeo ] ) . for a more detailed discussion of the geometry behind cartan geometrodynamics",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "we have given a reformulation of canonical general relativity in first order form which uses local observers that define a local notion of time .",
    "these give an embedding of the rotational subgroup @xmath2 into the lorentz group that allows to reconstruct lorentz covariance from the @xmath2 ashtekar - barbero formulation of canonical gravity .",
    "the geometry behind our constructions is best understood in terms of _ cartan geometrodynamics_. since this formulation requires only a local choice of time direction not necessarily related to a foliation of spacetime , it links the canonical and covariant formulations of general relativity @xcite",
    ".    it would be important to understand the coupling of matter  which would be necessary to investigate the possibility of physically observable lorentz violation  and the role of the field of internal observers there .",
    "so far they have been treated like lapse and shift , as lagrange multipliers .",
    "making the observer field dynamical could relate our framework to models with dynamical reference frames , such as brown - kucha dust @xcite .",
    "similar constructions could also be useful in approaches to quantum gravity where local lorentz covariance is not manifest , such as hoava - lifshitz gravity , shape dynamics or causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "taking the idea of local observers one step further , it is natural to consider the space of all possible choices of local observer  _ observer space_. in general relativity , this is the direct product of spacetime with the local velocity space @xmath62 of normalised future - directed timelike vectors , but we consider it as a seven - dimensional manifold in its own right and study its geometry , both in general relativity and in more general settings .",
    "this is the viewpoint adopted in the work @xcite , where we show how the cartan connection @xmath10 specified by a frame field @xmath16 and a spin connection @xmath55 as in ( [ cartanco ] ) gives a cartan geometry on observer space , with model space @xmath63 , the space of all observers in de sitter spacetime .",
    "conversely , we investigate integrability conditions that allow the reconstruction of an invariant spacetime starting from an observer space cartan geometry ( i.e. a general cartan geometry modelled on @xmath63 ) ; intuitively , such a reconstruction is possible if the connection is flat in the ` velocity ' directions of observer space .",
    "different approaches to quantum gravity and quantum - gravity phenomenology incorporate the idea that spacetime geometry is an observer - dependent ( or ` momentum - dependent ' ) , relative concept . from the perspective of observer space , such ideas correspond to observer space cartan connections that are not flat in velocity directions , so that no invariant spacetime can be reconstructed .",
    "one example is the proposal of relative locality @xcite which suggests that ` spacetime ' and hence the notion of locality are observer - dependent , but there is an invariant momentum space shared by all observers . in @xcite",
    "we find that the framework of relative locality corresponds to an observer space connection that is flat in ` spacetime ' , not ` velocity ' directions .",
    "for a general observer space geometry , both ` spacetime ' and ` velocity space ' are only defined relative to an observer .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether other ideas , such as that of an ` effective metric ' @xmath64 ( depending on a momentum scale @xmath65 ) that appears in the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity @xcite , can be discussed in the framework of observer space geometry .",
