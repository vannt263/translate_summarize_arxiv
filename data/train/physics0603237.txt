    "the classical mechanics and the infinitesimal calculus had been created by isaac newton in the 17th century practically simultaneously .",
    "the ordinary differential equations were the principal tool of the classical mechanics . in the 18th and 19th centuries the development of the classical mechanics",
    "was carried out by means of modification of dynamic equations , when they were applied to new dynamic systems .",
    "all this time the conception of the event space ( space - time ) retained to be unchanged . in the newtonian conception of the event space there are two independent invariants : space distance and time interval .    in the beginning of the 20th century",
    "albert einstein had discovered , that the dynamics may be developed not only by means of a modification of dynamic equations .",
    "the dynamics may be developed also by a modification of the event space .",
    "a. einstein suggested and carried out the first two modifications of the event space . in the first modification , known as the special relativity , two newtonian invariants ( space and time )",
    "were replaced by one invariant  the space - time interval .",
    "after such a replacement one may speak about the space - time and the space - time geometry .",
    "the second modification of the event space was produced by a.einstein ten years later .",
    "this modification is known as the general relativity .",
    "according to the general relativity the space - time geometry may be inhomogeneous , and this nonhomogeneity depends on the matter distribution in the space - time .",
    "in the thirties of the 20th century it was discovered that the free particles of small mass move stochastically . _",
    "the motion of free particles depends only on the space - time properties . _",
    "it meant that for the explanation of the observed stochasticity one needs the next modification of the event space .",
    "the necessary third modification of the space - time geometry were to look rather exotic .",
    "as far as the stochasticity was different for the particles of different mass , the free motion of a particle must depend on the particle mass , i.e. the particle mass is to be geometrized . in the framework of the riemannian geometry it was impossible .",
    "besides , in the framework of the classical mechanics the particle motion is deterministic . if we want to explain the particle motion stochasticity by the space - time properties , we are to use such a space - time geometry , where the free particle motion be primordially stochastic . in the framework of the riemannian geometry it was impossible .",
    "we did not know a geometry with such properties .    in the beginning of the 20th century we had the alternative : either space - time geometry with unusual exotic properties , or a refusal from the classical mechanics .",
    "we had no adequate space - time geometry .",
    "the alternative was resolved in favour of the quantum mechanics , which substituted the classical mechanics of the small mass particles . at such a substitution the principles of the classical mechanics",
    "were replaced by the quantum principles .",
    "such a replacement of the classical principles by the quantum principles was a very complicated procedure , which was produced only for nonrelativistic phenomena .",
    "the modification of the space - time geometry is more attractive from logical viewpoint , than the quantum mechanics , because it changes only space - time properties , but does not change classical principles of dynamics , whereas the quantum mechanics revises these principles .",
    "unfortunately , the third modification of the space - time geometry was impossible in the first half of the 20th century .",
    "the new conception of geometry , which made possible the third modification of the space - time @xcite , appeared only in the end of the 20th century .",
    "the new conception of geometry ( known as t - geometry @xcite ) is very simple .",
    "it supposes that any space - time geometry is described completely by the world function @xcite , and then any space - time geometry can be obtained from the proper euclidean geometry by means of a deformation ( replacement of the euclidean world function @xmath0 with the world function @xmath1 of the geometry in question in all definitions and relations of the proper euclidean geometry ) .",
    "the t - geometry has unusual properties . in general , it is multivariant and nonaxiomatizable .",
    "it can be represented in coordinateless form .",
    "discrete t - geometry and continuous one are described uniform .    in the new ( nondegenerate ) space - time geometry the particle mass is geometrized , the free particle motion is primordially stochastic , and",
    "the parallelism of vectors is absolute and intransitive , in general . besides , parameters of the space - time depend on the quantum constant , and the statistical description of stochastic particles motion is equivalent to the quantum description .",
    "a use of the nondegenerate space - time geometry admits one to return to the classical mechanics of stochastic particles , eliminating quantum principles",
    ".    in general , the infinitesimal calculus , created for the newtonian event space with the deterministic particle motion , disagrees with the space - time conception , where the free particle motion is primordially stochastic .",
    "one needs a new mathematical tool , which be in accordance with the nondegenerate space - time geometry .",
    "construction of such a tool is a very difficult problem , and we shall not try to solve it . instead , we _ take from the new space - time geometry only the property of stochastic motion of free particles and try to describe it in the conventional riemannian space - time_. in the riemannian space - time the natural motion of free particles is deterministic .",
    "we try to formulate the conventional classical mechanics in such a form , where the stochastic particle motion be natural , whereas the deterministic particle motion be a special case of the stochastic motion , when the stochasticity vanishes .",
    "note that the conventional classical mechanics considers only deterministic particles , whose motion is described by dynamic equations ( ordinary differential equations ) .",
    "one considers only some special cases of stochastic motion , referring to the probability theory in this consideration .",
    "the main object of the conventional classical mechanics is a single deterministic particle @xmath2 .",
    "from viewpoint of the conventional classical mechanics the deterministic particle ( dynamic system ) and the stochastic particle ( stochastic system ) are conceptually different objects .",
    "the conceptual difference consists in the fact that there are dynamic equations for the dynamic system and there are no dynamic equations for the stochastic system .",
    "there is not even a collective concept with respect to concept of dynamic system and that of stochastic system .",
    "if information on the deterministic particle @xmath2 is incomplete ( for instance , if the initial conditions are known approximately ) , there are different versions of the particle @xmath2 motion .",
    "the particle motion is multiple - path . in this case",
    "we consider all these possible versions .",
    "one uses the statistical ensemble @xmath3 $ ] , which is the set of many independent particles @xmath2 .",
    "different elements @xmath2 of the statistical ensemble @xmath4 $ ] move differently , and motion of all these elements describe all possible motions of the particle @xmath2 .",
    "the particle @xmath2 is a dynamic system , the statistical ensemble @xmath3 $ ] is also a dynamic system .",
    "it means that there are dynamic equations for both the particle @xmath5and the statistical ensemble @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "these dynamic equations describe the state evolution respectively of the particle @xmath2 and of the statistical ensemble @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "dynamic equations for @xmath2 and for @xmath4 $ ] are connected between themselves .",
    "for instance , if the dynamic system @xmath2 is a free nonrelativistic particle , the action @xmath6 for @xmath2 has the form @xmath7 = \\int \\frac{m}{2}\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}^{2}dt,\\qquad \\mathbf{\\dot{x}\\equiv } \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt }   \\label{a1.1}\\]]where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the particle mass .",
    "the action for the statistical ensemble @xmath3 $ ] of free independent particles @xmath2 is the sum of actions ( [ a1.1 ] ) .",

    "vice versa , one can obtain dynamic equations for @xmath2 from dynamic equations for @xmath3 $ ] .    what of dynamic systems @xmath2 and @xmath4 $ ] is primary , and what is derivative ?",
    "conventionally , one supposes that the dynamic system @xmath2 is a primary fundamental object , whereas the statistical ensemble is considered usually as a secondary derivative object , because it is a more complicated object , consisting of @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest to consider the statistical ensemble @xmath3 $ ] to be the primary object , whereas the single dynamic system @xmath2 is considered to be the secondary derivative object .",
    "such an approach admits one to construct dynamics of stochastic systems .",
    "indeed , the statistical ensemble @xmath20 $ ] of independent stochastic systems @xmath21 is a dynamic system , although @xmath21 is a stochastic system .",
    "it means that there exist dynamic equations for @xmath20 $ ] , although there are no dynamic equations for @xmath21 .",
    "explanation of this surprising fact is as follows . when we construct the statistical ensemble of many stochastic systems ,",
    "the regular features are accumulated , whereas random features are compensated . as a result ,",
    "if the number of stochastic systems tends to infinity , we obtain the system , having only regular characteristics . in other words ,",
    "we obtain a dynamic system .",
    "mathematically it looks as follows .",
    "we add some terms to the action ( d1.2 ) .",
    "these terms are chosen in such a way , to describe the quantum stochasticity , generated by the properties of the space - time geometry . the supposed method of taking into account of this stochasticity leads to the quantum description , which has been well investigated .",

    "is not well defined , one can not obtain dynamic equations for @xmath21 . by definition",

    "information on @xmath21 , obtained at investigation of @xmath20 $ ] , is not a full information .",
    "one may obtain the mean velocity of the stochastic particle , the mean trajectories , the mean energy and some other average characteristics . however",
    ", one can not obtain the velocity distribution and other more detailed characteristics of the stochastic particle . to obtain such detailed characteristics",
    ", one needs to use additional information on the stochastic particle properties ( investigation of the statistical ensemble @xmath20 $ ] is insufficient for this goal ) .",
    "nevertheless , the information , which is obtained from investigation of the statistical ensemble , appears to be valuable in many cases .",
    "for instance , one can show @xcite that by a proper change of variables the action ( [ d1.5 ] ) is reduced to the action for the schrdinger particle , i.e. to the action for the dynamic system , described by the schrdinger equation .",
