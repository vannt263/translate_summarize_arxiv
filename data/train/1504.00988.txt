    "with the rapid development of ultrashort and ultrastrong laser pulses @xcite , laser - matter interactions involving such pulses have been the subject of much interest @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts aimed at describing such pulses have also been evolving to meet the need to model the electric and magnetic fields of the required pulses @xcite    in the study of many laser - matter interactions which employ a focused laser beam , the laser fields are adequately described by solutions to the wave equation in the paraxial approximation @xcite . in the case of a tightly focused laser beam , this description is improved upon further using higher - order corrections to the paraxial solution . for example , in the lax series solution @xcite , the fields are given in ascending powers of the square of the diffraction angle @xmath0 , and provide a good description for a focused laser beam of long duration .",
    "here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the waist radius at focus and the rayleigh length , respectively .",
    "it was further shown that high - order corrections to the paraxial solution @xcite can have non - negligible contributions for evaluations of direct laser acceleration of particles @xcite .",
    "another solution of maxwell s equations for a focused laser beam can be obtained using the complex - source - point approach ( cspa ) @xcite .",
    "the fields via cspa , when expanded in terms of the parameter @xmath3 near the propagation axis of the focused beam , coincide with those via the lax series expansion approximation ( lsea ) @xcite . for a gaussian beam",
    "it was explicitly shown that the summation of an infinite lax series reduces exactly to the solution of cspa @xcite . the cspa solution for a propagating spherical",
    "wave is singular at the point @xmath4(@xmath5 ) , with the coordinate in the propagation direction @xmath6 and the radius @xmath7 , which limits its utility far from the propagation axis and causes problems in numerical simulations .",
    "however , a method for the regularization of cspa solutions was found @xcite . rather than a propagating spherical wave , one may use the field of a simple point source and a point sink placed at the origin , which constitutes a standing spherical wave .",
    "then the focused beam , according to cspa , is free from singularities @xcite .",
    "the latter field was shown to form when using a laser beam focusing with a parabolic mirror .",
    "however , the use of lsea , or analogously cspa , is limited in that the pulse temporal shape is factorized in the field expressions and , consequently , it does not take into account distortions of the pulse during propagation . while this may work well for rather long multi - cycle laser pulses ,",
    "in which the change in pulse - shape is not appreciable , yet for many important current and future developments involving ultrashort and tightly - focused pulses of laser light , the space - time evolution and distortion of the pulse - shape ought to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "an exact analytical solution of maxwell s equations is known which describes a focused laser beam of a special form with a cosine - squared pulse shape of arbitrary length @xcite .",
    "however , this solution in the form of a double sum is inconvenient for analytical treatments .",
    "the 3d vectorial maxwell s equations are solved in @xcite for a laser pulse , yet , only in the paraxial approximation .",
    "the extension of cspa to describe pulsed laser light has also been implemented @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , analytical results have been obtained mostly for isodiffracting laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the lsea approach was generalized to describe the spatio - temporal evolution of an ultrashort and tightly - focused laser beam by solving the wave equation with the use of two small parameters , namely , the spatial diffraction angle @xmath8 and the temporal spreading parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the laser pulse duration , @xmath11 the frequency , and @xmath12 the wave number ( @xmath13 in vacuum ) @xcite .",
    "the corrections to the paraxial and slowly varying envelope approximations for the fields of the focused radially polarized laser pulse of the @xmath14 gaussian mode were derived in @xcite with a purely time - domain approach .",
    "it was shown that due to those corrections the longitudinal field decreases quickly along the propagation direction .",
    "about two decades ago , esarey _ et .",
    "@xcite proposed a way to describe the spatio - temporal evolution of an ultrashort and tightly - focused laser beam by solving the wave equation with the use of a single small parameter , namely , the relative bandwidth of the laser pulse @xmath15 .",
    "this solution describes the field of an ultrashort laser pulse when the duration of the pulse fulfils the condition @xmath16 .",
    "the advantage here is that the ultrashort and tightly - focused laser beam is described by a compact expression in terms of an expansion over a single small parameter , in contrast to the approach of @xcite which uses expansions over two small parameters . in @xcite , the laser pulse propagating in a plasma was considered and the transverse fields ( with respect to the propagation direction ) were calculated from a transverse vector potential alone .",
    "however , the description of the longitudinal components of the laser field , which become very significant for tightly focused laser beams @xcite , requires the introduction of a scalar potential .",
    "moreover , when the laser field is described by scalar and vector potentials , the scalar potential will alter the transverse fields , as well .    in this paper",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the electromagnetic fields in vacuum of an ultrashort and tightly focused propagating laser pulse of linear polarization and of a poisson - like spectrum .",
    "the fields are derived using the approach of @xcite , but combining both contributions of vector and scalar potentials to describe properly the longitudinal field of the ultrashort and tightly focused laser beam .",
    "the field expressions include the first order corrections with respect to the small bandwidth parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ calcul ] the calculation of the fields is outlined .",

    "expressions for the electromagnetic fields propagating in vacuum may be found from vector and scalar potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , which satisfy the equations    @xmath20    provided the lorentz condition ( si units are used ) , @xmath21 is satisfied , simultaneously .",
    "they are equivalent to the full set of maxwell s equations in the absence of charges and currents @xcite .",
