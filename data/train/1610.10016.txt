    "classical mechanics , from mathematical point of view , is mostly developed in cases , where two extremely idealized forms of material objects are assumed - point particles ( ordinary differential equations ) and continuum media ( partial differential equations ) .",
    "however , big difference exists in the ideology of these two theories : for point particles the model is defined by the choice of the interaction potential between particles , which is supposed to be known , but in the continuum mechanics the interaction is defined by the pressure , which is one of the unknown functions in the equations . many papers - both mission proposals @xcite and concrete results for concrete models @xcite - discussed the connections between these two fields .",

    "this definition of @xmath14 has sense iff such particle is unique , that is iff for any @xmath9 and any @xmath15 @xmath16 that is iff the trajectories ( particles ) @xmath17 do not collide .",
    "this property obviously should be related to the similar property for @xmath0 particle system , if we want to obtain continuum media trajectories in the limit @xmath1 ( one could call this the ultralocal limit ) .",
    "we say that the @xmath0-particle system has no collisions , if for all @xmath18 and all @xmath19 @xmath20 and has strong property of absence of collisions if @xmath21 it is evident that there will not be any collisions if the repulsion between particles is sufficiently strong .",
    "however , for general hamiltonian systems the following question is completely non trivial : for which initial conditions @xmath22 the system enjoys the absence of collisions property . in this paper the property ( [ strong_nonintersection ] )",
    "plays the central role .",
    "it is surprising that we did not find papers where this property is discussed in the derivation of continuum media equations .",

    "we consider the particle system on the real line with a particular lennard - jones type potential and prove that the particle trajectories of the @xmath0-particle system , for @xmath1 , converge , in the sense defined below , to the trajectories of the continuum particle system .",
