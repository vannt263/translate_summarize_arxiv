    "recently , there has been considerable interest in the evolution ( energy - scale dependency ) of the yukawa coupling constants of quarks and leptons .",

    "the recent study on the quark masses and mixings has been given , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite . especially , recently , the evolution of the neutrino seesaw mass matrix has been received considerable attention ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in connection with the energy - scale dependence of the large mixing angle . as one of such unified models",
    ", there is a non - standard model , the so - called  universal seesaw model \" ( usm ) @xcite .",
    "the model describes not only the neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 but also the quark mass matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 and charged lepton mass matrix @xmath9 by the seesaw - type matrices universally : the model has hypothetical fermions @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ) in addition to the conventional quarks and leptons @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ; @xmath12 ) , and these fermions are assigned to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 of su(2)@xmath19 su(2)@xmath20 .",
    "the 6 @xmath21 6 mass matrix which is sandwiched between the fields ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath23 ) is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are universal for all fermion sectors ( @xmath14 ) and only @xmath27 have structures dependent on the flavors @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the @xmath33 mass matrices @xmath34 for the fermions @xmath35 are given by the well - known seesaw expression @xmath36 thus , the model answers the question why the masses of quarks ( except for top quark ) and charged leptons are so small compared with the electroweak scale @xmath37 ( @xmath38 10@xmath39 gev ) .",
    "recently , in order to understand the observed fact @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the top quark mass ) , the authors have proposed a universal seesaw mass matrix model with an ansatz @xcite @xmath42 for the up - quark sector ( @xmath43 ) . in the model , one of the fermion masses @xmath44",
    "is zero [ say , @xmath45 , so that the seesaw mechanism does not work for the third family , i.e. , the fermions ( @xmath46 ) and ( @xmath47 ) acquire masses of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we identify @xmath50 as the top quark @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we can understand the question why only the top quark has a mass of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "our interest is as follows : in the conventional model , the yukawa coupling constants @xmath52 of the fermions @xmath35 are given by @xmath53 .",
    "only the yukawa coupling constants @xmath54 of the top quark @xmath55 takes a large value @xmath56 .",
    "the other yukawa coupling constants @xmath52 are sufficiently smaller than one . on the contrast to the conventional model , in this usm , the matrices @xmath57 are universal for all fermion sectors @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath1 is of the order of one , the other @xmath60 will also be of the order of one .",
    "we are afraid that in such a model the yukawa coupling constants have landau poles at energy scales lower than a unification energy scale @xmath61 ( so that the model causes  burst \" of yukawa coupling constants before going to the unification energy scale ) .",
    "one of our interests is to investigate whether such a model can provide or not a set of reasonable parameter values under the conditions that the yukawa coupling constants ( and also the seesaw operators @xmath62 ) do not have the landau poles below @xmath61 .",
    "we also take an interest in the  democratic \" usm @xcite , which is an extended version of usm and has successfully given the quark masses and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite matrix parameters in terms of the charged lepton masses .",
    "however , the study is only phenomenology at the energy scale @xmath63 ( @xmath64 is the neutral weak boson mass ) .",
    "since the model is one of the promising models of the unified description of the quark and lepton mass matrices , it is important to investigate the evolutions of the mass matrices in the usm .",
    "the democratic usm is as follows :    \\(i ) the mass matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the same structure except for their phase factors @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant and @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "( the fermion masses @xmath70 are independent of the parameters @xmath71 .",
    "only the values of the ckm matrix parameters @xmath72 depend on the parameters @xmath71 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the basis on which the matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 are diagonal , the mass matrices @xmath27 are given by the form @xmath75",
    "@xmath76    \\(iii ) the parameter @xmath77 for the charged lepton sector is given by @xmath78 = 0 , so that in the limit of @xmath79 , the parameters @xmath80 are given by @xmath81 then , the up- and down - quark masses are successfully given by the choice of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , respectively .",
    "the ckm matrix is also successfully obtained by taking @xmath85    however , when we take the evolution of the yukawa coupling constants into the consideration , we should consider that the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) are required not at the electroweak energy scale @xmath86 , but at a unification energy scale @xmath61 , i.e. , the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) should be replaced with    @xmath87    @xmath88    and @xmath89 respectively , where mass matrices @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are expressed by @xmath90 respectively , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are higgs scalars whose vacuum expectation values ( vev ) break su(2)@xmath95 , su(2)@xmath20 , and an additional u(1 ) symmetry u(1)@xmath96 , respectively .",
    "( for simplicity , we have assumed that the values of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are real . )",
    "another interest in the present paper is to check whether or not the phenomenological study in the previous paper @xcite is still approximately valid under the evolution of the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "for example , the model with @xmath100 and @xmath101 has led to the relation @xcite @xmath102 almost independently of the value of the seesaw suppression factor @xmath103 .",
    "one of the reasons to taking the value of @xmath77 in the up - quark sector as @xmath101 exists in the successful relation ( 1.14 ) .",
    "therefore , we have interest whether the relation ( 1.14 ) still holds even when we take the evolution into consideration .    besides , even apart from such phenomenological interests , it is very important to investigate the general features of the evolution of the yukawa coupling constants in the universal seesaw model with det@xmath0 , because in the present model one of the fermions @xmath10 does not decouple from the theory at @xmath104 , so that the evolution shows peculiar behavior in contrast with the conventional seesaw model .",

    "[ m - nonsusy ] and [ m - susy ] , the relations ( 9.9)-(9.12 ) are also satisfied in the range i ( @xmath604 ) ( so that we read the relations ( 9.9)-(9.12 ) as @xmath605 ) . the values of @xmath606 and @xmath607 are approximately given by @xmath608 for the non - susy model , and by @xmath609 for the susy model . in the range ii ( @xmath119 ) , the relations ( 9.9)-(9.12 ) are slightly broken . in the susy model , the values show not @xmath610 , but @xmath608 in the range ii . however , in the model with @xmath611 , which is required in order to make the neutrino masses tiny , the evolution effects in the range ii are not so large , so that we can regard that the relations ( 9.9)-(9.12 ) are still satisfied in the range @xmath612 , i.e. , @xmath613 @xmath614 @xmath615 where @xmath616 , @xmath617 , and @xmath618 is defined by eq .",

    "the differences of the numerical behaviors of the quark masses , ckm matrix parameters and neutrino mass squared differences from those in the conventional model are substantially formed in the range iii .",
    "note that the mass ratios @xmath533 and @xmath625 are almost constant ( although the ratio @xmath625 is slightly changed in the susy model ) , so that the phenomenologically well - satisfied relation ( 1.14 ) still holds under the evolutions .    for the neutrino mass matrix @xmath6",
    ", we have investigate the model with @xmath540 , which leads to a large mixing @xmath626 .",

    "in contrast to the conventional seesaw neutrino mass matrix , note that the present neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 is form - invariant below @xmath113 , so that the neutrino mass ratios and mixings are invariant below @xmath113 .    in the present paper , we have assumed @xmath629 symmetries above @xmath113 . as seen in figs .",

    "the rapid increasing is mainly due to the rapid increasing of the gauge coupling constant @xmath631 above @xmath113 .",
    "if we want to build a unification model with a unified gauge symmetry g , we may consider that the u(1 ) symmetry is embedded into the unified symmetry g.
