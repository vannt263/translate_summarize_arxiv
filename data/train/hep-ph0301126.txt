    "so far a final consensus on the nature of the light scalar mesons has not been reached .",
    "in contrast to the case of the @xmath7 where new data on the in - medium modifications @xcite support the picture of two correlated pions the subject remains quite open concerning the nature of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the following a short list of some interpretations given .",
    "@xmath8-state : : :    despite the very successful mass predictions , e.g.  for vector mesons ,    coming from relativistic constituent quark models , mass predictions in    the scalar sector still vary considerably .",
    "the predictions depend    strongly on the choice for the dirac structure of the confining    potential and the models can not explain the reason for the    @xmath0/@xmath1-mass degeneracy . in ref .",
    "@xcite    either the mass of the @xmath0 or the @xmath1 is    reproduced depending on the spin parametrisation of confinement .",
    "other    authors @xcite deduce from their relativistic quark model the need    for a glueball mixing with the calculated states to reproduce    experimental data . within those mixing",
    "schemes interpretations vary    from minimal gluonic admixture to the @xmath8-states    @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xcite up to large gluonic    components @xcite .",
    "thus the answers coming from    @xmath8-models are not conclusive yet .",
    "@xmath9-states : : :    this structure allows for two configurations in colour space :    @xmath10 and @xmath11 . of course    those two configurations may mix/ rearrange to form a state like    @xmath12 with colour configuration    @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the number of expected tetraquark    states and their interpretation vary for different calculations and it    is difficult to distinguish a mesonic molecule from a tetraquark    state . in ref .",
    "@xcite for example 5 tetraquarks are found . from those    two",
    "are nearly mass degenerate and obtain the mass of the    @xmath0 and @xmath1 when a fudge factor is used to    account for neglected three and four body forces .",
    "this opposes the    complete tetraquark nonet expected in ref .",
    "@xcite , which might result    from the authors considering pure    @xmath14 and only allowing    @xmath15 admixture for large distances ,    whereas this component might occur at small distances by mixing of    @xmath10 , @xmath11 configurations ,    resulting in a less attractive interaction .",
    "this was for example    pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter paper",
    "it was observed , that    the four quarks in the confining potential are mainly arranged as two    colour singlets at large @xmath16 @xmath17 distance    and the notion of a mesonic molecule was introduced .",
    "mesonic molecules : : :    inspired by the original mesonic molecule in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the    @xmath9 case ) a second molecule picture    @xcite was developed in which only mesonic degrees of freedom    ( i.e.  colour singlets ) were considered .",
    "since    @xmath18-exchange between the @xmath19-pair    sets the scale for the bound state identified as @xmath1 , it    might be even more compact than the molecule of ref .",
    "this is    why radiative @xmath20 decays exclude the extended molecule    of ref .",
    "@xcite while still giving strong evidence in favour of a    compact @xmath19-state or , as it is phrased in    ref .",
    "@xcite , a compact four - quark state . furthermore the chiral    unitary approach , which in its structure is very close to the mesonic    model , has no problems to describe radiative @xmath20-decays    @xcite , which is a hint that the discussed @xmath19    state really is compact .",
    "chiral unitary approach : : :    inspired by chiral perturbation theory , schemes have been developed to    deal with unitarity . as above those methods",
    "generate bound states from    two mesons @xcite .",
    "these states differ from mesonic molecules only by    the theoretical framework used to calculate them and not by physical    content .",
    "semi - bound states : : :    in some models the attraction for the mesonic sector is not sufficient    to generate bound states .",
    "one example for this is the cusp - effect in    ref .",
    "@xcite which is identified with a @xmath0 signal .",
    "another example would be the model of ref .  @xcite . here",
    "the light    scalar mesons do not stem from the confining potential but they have    their origin in the @xmath21-barrier , which is just too low    to generate bound meson - meson states . mixing - schemes : : :    a different approach to explain the abundance of observed scalar    states is to introduce a scalar glueball around    @xmath22@xmath23 gev as predicted by lattice    calculations .",
    "this glueball then mixes with the other scalar states to    form the observed resonances .",
    "depending on the predicted masses of the    glueball and the bare states different mixings are obtained ,    e.g.  @xcite .",
    "vacuum scalars : : :    this idea of identifying @xmath1 and @xmath0 as    systems formed of negative kinetic energy @xmath24 and    @xmath25 flavours @xcite seems to be ruled out by experiment    even though the predictive power of this model was plagued by the    complexity of the calculations .",
    "the predicted compact size of the    object contrasts too much with the decay constant ratio of    @xmath0 and @xmath26 as shown in @xcite .    during the discussion in the workshop",
    ", tetraquark models were favoured whereas no conclusion was drawn on the characteristic of the different four - quark states .",
    "no key observables have been identified to discriminate mesonic molecules , chiral unitarity effects and @xmath9-states .",
    "it was pointed out that the available data set on the production of the light scalars in hadronic interactions needs to be extended .",
    "measurements of as many observables as possible with different beam(@xmath27)-target(@xmath28 ) combinations and tests of isospin ratios should be performed .",
    "in particular , the observation of the process @xmath29 which is forbidden by isospin conservation might yield information about the strength of the @xmath30-@xmath1 mixing .",
    "data about the production and decay of the light scalar resonances from cosy are rather scarce yet .",
    "some information about the @xmath31-production cross sections in @xmath2 and @xmath4 reactions can be deduced model dependently @xcite from data on @xmath32 production .",
    "such measurements have been performed at the cosy-11 and momo facilities at beam energies close to the @xmath32-production threshold , see table  [ tab : data ] .",
    ".overview over the available data from cosy [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     according to the model calculations outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fraction of resonantly produced @xmath19 pairs ( via the @xmath31 ) in @xmath33 reactions is significantly larger than for the @xmath34 case .",
    "following this idea , two measurements of the reactions @xmath35 have been performed at the anke spectrometer for @xmath36 and 104 mev .",
    "the total @xmath37 cross section at @xmath38 mev is about @xmath3945  nb @xcite , in excelent agreement with the model predictions ( @xmath3940  nb ) .",
    "the same model predicts a resonant contribution of @xmath3970% for this @xmath40 value @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is in line with a preliminary analysis of the @xmath41 decay channel where a resonant structure around 980  mev / c@xmath42 is seen in the invariant @xmath41-mass distribution with a width of @xmath43  mev / c@xmath42 @xcite . from these data it can be concluded that systematic studies of the light scalar mesons are possible with anke .",
    "it was suggested long ago that the coupling of the @xmath44- and @xmath45-resonances to the @xmath46 continuum should give rise to a significant @xmath30-@xmath1 mixing in the vicinity of the @xmath46 threshold @xcite .",
    "different aspects of this mixing , the underlying dynamics , and the possibilities to measure this effect have been discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested by close and kirk  @xcite that new data from the wa102 collaboration at cern  @xcite on the central production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the reaction @xmath47 provide evidence for a significant @xmath0-@xmath1-mixing intensity @xmath48% .",
    "possible experimental tests of isospin violation due to @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing based on a combined analysis of the reactions @xmath49 are discussed in ref .",
    "a corresponding proposal for measurements at anke @xcite has already been approved by the cosy - pac and the measurements are planned for winter 2003/04 .",
    "direct production of the @xmath0 resonance in the reaction @xmath50 is forbidden if isospin is conserved .",
    "it can , for example , be observed due to @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing @xmath51 therefore it is very interesting to study the reaction @xmath52 at @xmath53 . any signal of reaction ( [ dd ] ) will be related to isospin breaking , which is expected to be more pronounced near the @xmath1 threshold as compared to the region below ( or above ) .",
    "an important point for the feasibility of such measurements is the magnitude of the cross sections @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "experimental data are not available yet and we try to give a qualitative estimate of these cross sections : according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the cross - section ratio @xmath56 is about 0.04 at @xmath57 mev .",
    "we assume an approximately equal ratio for the case of @xmath58 production near the threshold : @xmath59    using the momo data @xcite on the reaction @xmath60 ( see table  [ tab : data ] ) we find : @xmath61 at @xmath62 mev .",
    "the momo collaboration notes that their invariant @xmath32-mass distributions follow phase space .",
    "however , as it was shown for the case of the @xmath0 resonance in ref .",
    "@xcite , the shape of the invariant mass spectrum following phase space can not be distinguished from resonance production at @xmath63 mev .",
    "therefore , the broad mass distribution of the momo data may also be related to the @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "this statement is supported by a two - step model where the amplitude of the reaction @xmath64 can be constructed from the subprocesses @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( cf",
    ".   refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as it is known from the available experimental data @xcite the cross section of the reaction @xmath67 near threshold",
    "has an essential contribution from the @xmath1 resonance in the case of isoscalar @xmath46 production .",
    "thus the cross section of the reaction @xmath68 near threshold is expected to be not significantly smaller than the upper limit from momo of about @xmath69 nb at @xmath70 mev .    for an estimate of @xmath71 ) at @xmath72 we assume that the cross section @xmath73 is also dominated by resonant @xmath1 production at @xmath74 , and that @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath76 finally , using eq.([eq : dd2hef0 ] ) , we get for @xmath77 : @xmath78    the measurement of reactions ( [ ddalfakk ] ) and ( [ ddalfaf0 ] ) with cross sections in the sub - nb range are possible at the anke spectrometer . using a cluster - jet target with hydrogen as target material luminosities of @xmath79 have been achieved @xcite . assuming that comparable luminosities can be reached with deuterium",
    ", about 1040 ( @xmath80 ) events can be detected within one week of beam time ( based on the experience of the previous @xmath81 beam times ) .",
    "the pions from reaction ( [ ddalfaf0 ] ) have broader angular distributions and , thus , the acceptance of anke is about one order of magnitude smaller which is partially compensated by the larger cross section .",
    "it is planned that within a few years anke will be equipped with a frozen - pellet target @xcite and a large - acceptance photon detector @xcite . since",
    "the achievable luminostities then will be roughly one order of magnitude higher , the isospin - violating process ( [ dd ] ) can be investigated by detecting the decay photons @xmath82 and @xmath83 in coincidence with the @xmath84 .",
    "the latter will be again identified and momentum reconstructed with anke . based on our cross section estimate ( [ csest ] )",
    "we conclude that a few weeks of beam time will be sufficient to collect several 100 events .",
