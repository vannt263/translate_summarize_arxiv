    "another is the evaluation of background in electron scattering from polarized ammonia . in this case , the contributions from the unpolarized nitrogen relative to the polarized proton must be taken into account to extract spin - dependent inclusive cross section asymmetries .    a prime motivation for a new empirical fit is the availability of a large body of new , high precision electron - nucleus scattering data from jefferson lab  @xcite .",
