    "@xcite introduced the denomination `` liberal '' to make a distinction between binary evolution with mass and angular momentum loss and the conservative case where no mass and consequently no angular momentum leave the system .",
    "@xcite showed that the binary as eri is the result of liberal binary evolution ; the amounts of mass and angular momentum lost by the system are however uncertain .",
    "@xcite showed that only 60 @xmath3 of the mass lost by the loser of @xmath4 per was captured by the gainer and that 30 @xmath3 of the initial angular momentum was lost during rlof .",
    "hence it is clear that the liberal evolutionary scenario is important for binary evolution calculations .",
    "however the amount of mass and angular momentum that has to be removed from interacting systems is far from obvious .    with the brussels simultaneous evolution code ( a description is given in `` the brightest binaries '' ,",
    "@xcite ) we calculated a representative grid of conservative evolution of binaries with a b type primary at birth .",
    "application of the criterion of @xcite allows then to determine for each of the evolutionary sequences the beginning and ending of various algol - stages .",
    "this criterion states that in the semi - detached system :    @xmath5  the less massive star fills its roche lobe ( rl ) + @xmath5  the most massive star does not fill its rl and is still on the main sequence + @xmath5  the less massive star is the coolest , the faintest and the largest +    the grid allows to determine an expected distribution of orbital periods and mass ratios of algols .",
    "these can be compared to the well established observed distributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering the examples mentioned above ( @xcite ,",
    "@xcite ) it may be expected that the match between the observations and the conservative results are far from satisfactory .",
    "therefore we add liberal calculations to our conservative library .",
    "the detailed evolutionary tracks can be found in ` http://www.vub.ac.be/astrofys/ `",
    "our grid contains binaries with sufficiently small initial periods to lead to case a rlof ( rlof a ) : i.e. during h core burning of the donor ( initially primary star that becomes the less massive after algol - ignition ) .",
    "the track across the hrd is traced for every system in our grid . a binary lives its era of `` algolism '' ( @xcite ) when it obeys the criterion of @xcite .",
    "every binary shows its algol a ( algol during h core burning ) aspect for some time during rlof a. the drastical change of the mass ratio and the orbital period during this process can be followed in detail for every system in our grid .",
    "it happens frequently that rlof a is succeeded by case b rlof ( rlof b ) : i.e. during h shell burning of the donor .",
    "systems that have sufficiently large initial orbital periods so that rlof a does not occur will also show a short living algol b ( algol during h shell burning ) appearance .",
    "these systems have been considered in a previous paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig_fig1 ] shows a typical example of a case ab .",
    "the ( 7 + 4.2)@xmath6 binary with an intial period of 2.5 d starts as algol a with q=1 and p=2.06 d. it ends this algol a stage after some 20 million years with q=0.27 and p=6.87 d. from these inital values the system remains an algol b for some 1.5 million years during h shell burning of the donor .",
    "the system eventually evolves into a long periodic ( p@xmath750 d ) algol b with q @xmath8 0.1 .",
    "the grid contains some 240 more evolutionary tracks .",
    "from our grid of conservative calculations we made a simulation of the distribution of orbital periods and mass ratios of algols using a monte carlo algorithm . as starting conditions we selected :    @xmath5  the primaries imf of @xcite : @xmath9(m)@xmath10  @xmath11 + @xmath5  an initial distrubution of orbital periods from @xcite : @xmath12(p)@xmath10@xmath13 + @xmath5  an initial mass ratio distribution as derived by @xcite from the non - evolved systems of the catalogue of spectroscopic binaries shown on ` http://sb9.astro.ulb.ac.be/ ` +    the distribution of the initial mass ratio q = @xmath14 obeys relation ( 1 ) :    @xmath15    figure [ fig_fig2 ] shows the observed distribution of orbital periods of algols .",
    "here we find more a than b - cases , because the algol a - phase goes on for a fraction of the nuclear time scale , whereas the algol b - phase lasts only for a fraction of the much shorter kelvin - helmholtz time scale .",
    "rlof a produces algols that follow the observed distribution rather well . since the periods of the algol b cases peak towards the long periods , a contribution of a few @xmath16 of b cases to the algol population will mimic the observed period distribution well .",
    "figure [ fig_fig3 ] shows the observed mass ratio distribution of algols .",
    "the mass ratio q is now defined as the observers do : q = @xmath17 .",
    "the mass ratios of the algol b cases peak towards the smallest mass ratios , whereas rlof a produces a majority of algols in the q - bin @xmath180.2 - 0.4@xmath19 . as a consequence an admixture of cases a and",
    "b will never reproduce well the observed mass ratio distribution in the q - bins @xmath180.4 - 1@xmath19 .",
    "we may conclude that liberal binary evolution is needed to describe the mass ratio distribution of algols .",
    "mass loss is defined by a parameter @xmath20 describing the fraction of the mass lost by the loser that is accreted by the gainer :      conservative evolution is described with @xmath20 = 1 , whereas the liberal case uses values of @xmath20 @xmath22 1 which are not known beforehand .",
    "conservative evolution implies that no angular momentum can be lost by the system , whereas the amount of loss of angular momentum in the liberal case is also a free parameter if no physics restricts the assumptions .",
    "it is clear that realistic hydrodynamical calculations should learn us the appropriate choice of the amounts of mass and angular momentum which are lost by a binary at any moment of the rlof process . in the mean time",
    "we have performed a number of liberal evolutionary calculations and compared the results with the observations .      for a given value of @xmath20",
    ", the amount of angular momentum lost by the system is defined by the position of the site where matter is recoiled from the system . @xcite",
    "have argued that matter can be trapped in a keplerian ring after transit across the second lagrangian point @xmath23 .",
    "the radius of the ring is @xmath24 times the semi major axis of the orbit .",
    "this keplerian ring passes outside @xmath23 which is located at @xmath24 @xmath8 1.25 .",
    "this yields a minimum value of @xmath24 @xmath8 1.25 .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations of @xcite locate the ring at @xmath24 @xmath8 3 .",
    "this yields a maximum value of @xmath24 @xmath8 3 .",
    "a keplerian ring located at @xmath24 @xmath8 2.25 takes away as much angular momentum as the co - rotating point @xmath23 would do .",
    "a value of @xmath24 @xmath8 2.25 is thus a fair value in the interval @xmath181.25 - 3@xmath19 that can be used to calculate the change of the orbital period of a binary as a consequence of loss of mass and angular momentum through a ring which rotates with keplerian velocity around the center of mass of the system ( @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations reveal that if the system loses angular momentum across points located near @xmath24 @xmath8 2.25 the orbital periods shrink drastically .",
    "most binaries become mergers before they show algolism . the obtained distribution of orbital periods of algols is completely shifted towards the shortest periods . since this conclusion conflicts with observations , the mass that leaves the system carries rather the angular momentum of points located near @xmath24 @xmath8 0 than near @xmath24 @xmath8 2.25 .    for all these ( statistically sound but physically not well understood ) reasons we performed a number of calculations with constant @xmath20 = 0.5 and angular momentum lost at the edge of the gainer . until now only the representative cases with a 7@xmath6 primary at birth and initial periods leading to rlof a have been performed .",
    "figure [ fig_fig4 ] shows that the assumption of mass loss through a point near @xmath24 = 0 does not alter the conservative distribution of the orbital periods of algols . a conclusion that meets the observations since the conservative orbital period distribution matched the observations fairly well .",
    "figure [ fig_fig5 ] shows that our liberal assumption ( @xmath20=0.5 , @xmath24 @xmath8 0 ) deviates radically from the conservative case .",
    "the q - bins @xmath180.4 - 1@xmath19 which were not populated in the conservative scenario are now populated properly as required by the observations ( see figure [ fig_fig3 ] ) .",
