    "<S> we stress that the majorization relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , constitutes the necessary and sufficient condition under which the above transformation is allowed , without any reference to the corresponding schmidt bases . </S>",

    "<S> this protocol defines a new partial order relation that it is called _ trumping majorization _ , and reads as follows : given @xmath21 , it is said that @xmath8 is _ trumping majorized _ by @xmath9 ( and denoted by @xmath65 ) , iff , there exists a catalytic @xmath66 such that @xmath67 ( see @xcite for some mathematical properties of trumping and @xcite for an extension of this concept related to shannon entropy ) . </S>",

    "<S> if the states are not related by a majorization relation as in theorem [ th : nielsen1999 ] , the best we can do is to obtain an approximate target . </S>",

    "<S> now , we give some considerations related to the lattice structure of majorization that allow us to compare with the optimum state of criterion [ crit : vidal2000 ] . </S>",
