    "electron scattering experiments off light nuclei at high momentum transfer ( few gev / c ) are expected to be performed at facilities such as tjnaf .",
    "these experiments will provide new information on the intermediate and short range behavior of the nuclear interaction , establishing an important challenge to theoretical models .",
    "in fact , at these regimes , theoretical descriptions of the adequate hadronic degrees of freedom  nucleons , mesons and resonances  have to be based on both relativistic kinematics and dynamics .    over the past years",
    "different relativistic formulations have been investigated for application to light nuclei , which can be classified in two major categories : relativistic hamiltonian dynamics and relativistic field theories .",
    "the first one , not considered in the present paper , assumes basically one of two alternative forms , the light - front form @xcite and the instant form .",
    "the latter is developed within a schrdinger equation framework , uses variational monte carlo techniques and has been applied recently to the 3- and 4-nucleon systems @xcite . in this formalism relativistic covariance",
    "is achieved through the poincar group algebra , and the resulting hamiltonian consists of a relativistic kinematic energy operator and 2- and 3-body interactions .",
    "the 2-body interaction , containing asymptotic relativistic corrections , is parameterized in order to reproduce the nn data ( @xmath0 for @xmath1 parameters ) below 350 mev ; it also comprises boost corrections up to the order of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total 3-momentum of the interacting pair and @xmath4 is the nucleon mass .",
    "finally , the 3-body interaction is fitted to the triton binding energy .",
    "the generalization to heavier systems is in principle possible .",
    "the second category methods are based on meson exchange diagrams .",
    "the non - perturbative character of the nuclear interaction definitely requires infinite sums of these amplitudes .",
    "as well known , infinite series can effectively be summed by means of integral equations , which assigns to the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite a predominant role in the relativistic description of the nn problem .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation is a manifestly covariant 4-dimensional integral equation . in principle",
    ", its interaction kernel should include all irreducible diagrams derived from a considered lagrangian , which is clearly out of reach of the present calculations .",
    "this limitation determines inevitably the truncation of the kernel expansion and only a restrict set of appropriate meson exchange diagrams is kept .",
    "even with a truncated kernel the bethe - salpeter equation is , beyond ladder approximation , very hard to solve .",
    "this difficulty lead to the development of covariant dimensional reductions , imposing restrictions on the energy variable , from which 3-dimensional integral equations , known as quasi - potential ( qp ) equations , are obtained .    among qp equations ,",
    "the gross equation @xcite considers only ladder and crossed - ladder diagrams , and is derived from the assumption that important cancellations between the two categories of diagrams occur .",
    "these cancellations mean that their sum is dominated by the contribution , to the ladder diagrams , of the mass pole of the heavier particle or , for equal interacting masses , by the combination of the corresponding mass poles . in the first case ,",
    "the gross prescription consists on replacing the sum of the ladder and crossed - ladder diagrams by the ladder diagrams with the massive particle on its mass shell . in the second case ,",
    "a symmetrized combination of the ladder diagrams with one of the interacting particles on its mass shell is required .",
    "the amplitudes obtained contain ( @xmath5 ) parameters ( meson masses and coupling constants ) fitted to the nn data ( @xmath6 ) below the pion production threshold .    for scalar interacting particles in the static limit ( the limit when the mass of one of the interacting particles goes to infinity )",
    ", the above cancellation is proved to be exact order by order @xcite , meaning that in this case the gross prescription is exact .",
    "when one of the masses , although finite , remains much larger than the other , the prescription is a very good approximation as shown by maung and gross @xcite .",
    "this result motivates the application of the gross or spectator equation to the proton - nucleus scattering , such as @xmath7ca scattering @xcite . for equal masses",
    "it may be shown that the approximation is still reasonably good @xcite .    in nuclear applications , however , the spinor structure of the nucleon is essential , and the vertex interaction includes a dirac matrix structure .",
    "moreover , for pion exchanges with pseudovector coupling ( pv ) , the coupling supported by chiral symmetry arguments , the integral equations diverge , forcing the adoption of regularization schemes of some kind .",
    "the most common regularization procedure consists on the inclusion of form - factors , which could , in principle , be reinterpreted in terms of self - energy contributions of nucleons and mesons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the determination from first principles of self - energies , due to radiative corrections , would require the resolution of coupled dyson - schwinger equations , again far beyond the present calculations capability .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of form - factors can also be justified as an effective way of representing the internal structure of the hadrons and , as a consequence , phenomenological form - factors have to be considered .    in these situations , where dirac particles exchange mesons with realistic couplings implying the transfer of some quantum numbers , the quality of the gross prescription has not yet been studied systematically .",
    "therefore its application in such circunstances has , at present , only heuristic and pragmatic motivations .",
    "even so , the gross prescription has been already applied to the 2- and 3-nucleon systems @xcite , which urges , on one hand , the study of its ability to approximate the exact solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation with ladder and crossed - ladder series ( from here on we use exact in this sense ) and , on the other , the search for ways to systematically improve it .",
    "this study is precisely the goal of the present work .",
    "the analysis is focused on fourth - order diagrams with incoming and outgoing particles on - mass - shell , since the complexity of the calculations is substantial and the information obtained is already very rich and relevant .",
    "these amplitudes were considered before in references @xcite ; in the first one only the static limit was evaluated , in the second one the recent nn models were not considered yet , and the comparison between the gross prescription and the exact calculation is presented only for one energy . in sec .",

    "within a covariant field theory framework , the scattering amplitude @xmath8 is given by the sum of all the possible interaction processes ( represented by feynman diagrams ) derived from the lagrangian under consideration .",

    "a common approximation consists on restricting @xmath15 to a sum of one boson ( or meson ) exchange diagrams , and is usually called the ladder approximation .",
    "there are two main objections to this approximation : firstly the one body limit ( the klein - gordon or dirac equations with interaction terms ) is not recovered when one of the masses goes to infinity @xcite ; secondly it has been shown that , in general , crossed - ladder diagrams have important contributions @xcite , and hence should not be neglected .",
    "alternative ways rely on the replacement of the bs equation by the system @xmath22 which is perfectly equivalent to the bs equation . in this equations",

    "( [ qp1 ] ) .",

    "as it can be seen from this equation , the gross choice means that the particle with mass @xmath4 is placed on its mass shell in all intermediate states .",
    "the principal motivation for the gross equation comes from the cancellation theorem @xcite , that states that for scalar particles in the static limit ( @xmath28 ) , the sum of all ladder and crossed - ladder diagrams is exactly given by the sum of ladder diagrams with the massive particle on its mass shell .",
    "this is shown to be a result of important cancellations between ladder and crossed - ladder amplitudes in all orders . in fig .",
    "[ cancel ] this cancellation is illustrated for fourth - order diagrams . in all figures",

    "this result guarantees in particular that the fourth - order amplitude satisfies unitarity : the only possible imaginary part comes from the two - nucleon unitarity cut .",

    "our study will henceforth show that the inclusion of crossed - box and subtracted - box diagrams in the kernel allows us to be more discriminative in our choices for the short - range parameterization of the the nn interaction",
    ". we will be back to this discussion in the next sections .",
    "finally , we note that the usual procedure for antisymmetrizing the amplitudes has to be performed .",

    "nucleons are not elementary particles and consequently their hadronic structure has to be taken into account . mathematically , such structure provides the necessary regularization of the integrals for the high order loops , needed to build in the analytical structure of a bound state wavefunction , or of a scattering transition matrix .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet possible to obtain the description of the nucleon structure directly from the qcd lagrangian , or even from effective models inspired on constituent quark structure .",
    "the compositeness of the nucleons is therefore currently described by means of form - factors which have to be phenomenologically fixed . yet",
    ", it has been shown by gross and riska @xcite that it is possible to describe consistently the electromagnetic interaction with nucleons , within a relativistic and manifestly covariant framework , with phenomenological strong form - factors for the meson - nucleon vertices , present in the current conservation relations following the ward - takahashi identities .    in non relativistic applications ,",
    "analytic dipolar ( or even higher power ) functions of the 3-momentum are used as form - factors . in relativistic applications",
    "the covariance requirement motivates the use of form - factors of the type : @xmath106 where @xmath107 substitutes @xmath108 in the non - relativistic form - factors .",
    "the introduction of the strong form - factors can be interpreted as vertex - dressing , and we take them to have a factorized separable form , as done in reference @xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 stand for the nucleon and meson form - factors respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the nucleon 4-momenta and @xmath112 the meson 4-momentum . as a consequence , the @xmath56 function , introduced in the sec .",

    "these choices imply that the _ effective _ nucleon propagator for those models is the product @xmath121 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{\\tilde \\lambda_n^2}{m^2-i\\tilde \\lambda_n^2-p^2 } \\right]^2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath122 .",

    "such widths have ad - hoc energy and 3-momentum dependencies , in particular they are constant in the entire energy and momentum range , with the consequence of inducing spurious imaginary contributions in the scattering amplitude .",
    "we can interpret these complex mass terms as inelasticity sources associated with nucleon or meson excitations , which nevertheless are non physical , namely because they open channels at energies below the pion production threshold .    as we will see in the next section , the spurious contributions may be small under some conditions , e.g. for light meson scalar exchange , but they have sizeable effects for a pion exchange with pseudovector coupling .",
    "the pathology of the form - factor that we are discussing manifests only when we use it in the _ full _ bethe - salpeter equation , that is to say , when we treat the energy - component as a totally independent variable . for the gross reduction , where these form - factors were used and calibrated by the data , the spurious components are not evident : the prescription for the @xmath32 variable constrains its range such that the non - physical complex singularities are irrelevant .",
    "in other words , the spectator equation is insensitive to the existence of the complex poles of the form - factors .",
    "nevertheless , the study of the validity of the gross prescription , as well as the introduction of possible required corrections to the kernel of the integral equation , need to incorporate crossed - box and subtracted - box diagrams which may be crucially affected by the form - factors poles .    in order to solve the problem we explored alternative form - factor functions . since the form - factors are essentially needed to cut the 3-momentum range of the integrals , we made the choice of not allowing the regularization function to depend on the relative energy variable .",
    "however , in order to still satisfy covariance , the new form - factors were built by giving to the square of the 3-momentum @xmath124 a covariant form .",
    "more specifically , in an arbitrary frame where the total two nucleon momentum is @xmath11 , @xmath125 is replaced by the lorentz invariant @xmath126 with @xmath127 in the cm frame .",
    "@xmath128 stands for the square root of @xmath129 .",
    "it becomes clear from this equation that the price to be paid for this new choice , which does not consider the relative energy dependence explicitly , is to have form - factors depending on the on - mass - shell momentum of the external particles , or , in other words , on the total momentum @xmath11 of the 2 nucleon system .",
    "the complexities implied by this choice are only relevant , but with the possibility of being actually handled in practice , for the 3-nucleon applications , where the 2-nucleon subsystem has to be treated in the 3-nucleon system cm frame .",
    "they will also imply a new version of the work on the electromagnetic currents of reference @xcite , since in this reference the nucleon - nucleon interaction does not depend on the total momentum of the system .",

    "we may advance at this point that this term has very little importance : the results with and without it differ by at most 10% , with the exception of the region where the amplitudes vanish in the @xmath137 channel .    a new version of the nucleon form - factors @xmath110 is also required .",

    "( [ fn1 ] ) and ( [ fpi1 ] ) whose singularity structure implies the inclusion of the corresponding residues .      as a reference calculation ( an important check to our analytical calculations and numerical results ) we considered the simplest case of scalar exchange between scalar identical particles of mass @xmath4 ( equal masses ) , where no form - factors are needed .",
    "we used the parameters @xmath143 the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ scalar = m ] for three different kinetic energies in the lab reference frame .",
    "the curves refer to the box and crossed - box amplitudes , their sum and the spectator amplitude . for comparison",
    "we also include the result for the amplitude corresponding to the blankenbecler - sugar quasi - potential equation .",
    "the figure clearly shows the cancellation between parts of the box and the crossed - box amplitudes , which has been shown previously to occur only in the static limit @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is interesting , and in the meantime path integral techniques have been used to verify its validity for all orders @xcite .",
    "next we considered the exchange of a scalar meson between nucleons , which forces us to consider the @xmath144 and @xmath137 isospin nn channels .",
    "form - factors of eqs .",
    "( [ fn1 ] ) and ( [ fpi1 ] ) were included , and the parameters were taken from the models used in the three - nucleon calculations @xcite , which read @xmath145 we note that our calculation does not include the general off - shell couplings of the original model @xcite .    the results for laboratory kinetic energy @xmath146 of 100 , 200 , and 300 mev are shown in figs .",
    "[ sigma0 ] and [ sigma1 ] , for the @xmath144 and @xmath137 cases respectively .",
    "one concludes that the real part of the sum of the box and crossed - box amplitudes is well differs from the gross amplitude , being the relative deviation of the order of 15% for both isospin channels , at 100 mev , and 30% at 200 mev . for 300 mev",
    "these deviations become 50% for @xmath144 and 70% for @xmath137 .",
    "this quantifies how the approximation deteriorates with increasing energy .",
    "it is interesting to add that in general the fourth order @xmath147 exchange contributions are 10% of the second order ( one @xmath147 exchange ) .",
    "the quality of the gross prescription is slightly improved for a lighter exchanged meson , as shown in figs .",
    "[ pion0 ] and [ pion1 ] , where the results were obtained with : @xmath148 since this exchange does not correspond to the pseudovector pion exchange , the value of the coupling constant was arbitrarily chosen by the convenience .",
    "this situation has been considered to study how the quality of the gross prescription depends on the meson mass . from the same figures we can conclude also",
    "that while at 100 mev the crossed - box amplitudes are very small , they become important at higher energies and can not be neglected , as assumed by the ladder approximation . as for the retardation effects we can say that the contributions from the meson poles in the box and crossed - box tend to cancel each other .",
    "we may then conclude that the ladder approximation overestimates meson retardation effects .",
    "note that we showed only the real part of the fourth - order amplitudes .",
    "as discussed in the sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the only imaginary contribution comes from the spectator amplitude @xmath70 when the form - factors have no singularities .",
    "this is not obviously the case of the form - factors of eqs .",
    "( [ fn1 ] ) and ( [ fpi1 ] ) , but fortunately the additional spurious residues contributions are small and mean less than a 2% contribution .",
    "so in this case the unitarity violation is very small .",
    "next we evaluated the box and crossed - box amplitudes for the @xmath149nn coupling of eq .",
    "( [ lpi ] ) restricted to pv coupling ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "we also used the form - factors introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ fn1 ] ) and ( [ fpi1 ] ) . the pion mass and cut - off parameters",
    "were given above and the coupling constant taken from the references @xcite @xmath151    the allowed exchange of isospin introduces weighting factors for the box and crossed - box that are not the same for the two different isospin channels , resulting for the fourth - order amplitude @xmath152 the sign difference in the coefficients affecting the crossed - box contribution in the isoscalar and isovector parts , makes difficult the simultaneous representation of the exact amplitudes , in the two isospin channels , by the spectator - on - mass - shell approximation .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes for @xmath153 mev are represented in fig .",
    "[ pvw18 ] .",
    "the first observation to be made is that their magnitudes , specially for the case of the imaginary part , are abnormally large : the obe contributions corresponding to exchanged heavy mesons of the same model are @xmath154 100 @xmath155 .",
    "the second observation is that contrarily to the scalar coupling case the imaginary contribution of the crossed - box amplitude , that should be exactly zero , does not vanish , being two orders of magnitude larger than the box imaginary part .",
    "these conclusions are true for both isospin channels .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the reason for these results lies in the complex singularities present in the form - factors of ( [ fn1 ] ) and ( [ fpi1 ] ) , which clearly violate the unitarity condition .",
    "small changes on the cut - off parameters @xmath156 modify the final results , but do not change the orders of magnitude obtained .",
    "the figures also show the dominance of the crossed - box amplitude justified by a cumbersome combination of the presence of @xmath157 in the coupling and the @xmath158 form - factor . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ plotfpi ] , this form - factor peaks in the region @xmath159 , where the negative - energy nucleon poles , defining the @xmath85 and @xmath88 contributions , occur : consequently these amplitudes are largely ( and artificially ) enhanced .",
    "contrarily , in the box amplitude , the negative energy - state contribution included in @xmath160 is strongly suppressed by the nucleon @xmath161 form - factor , since one of the nucleons is very much off - mass - shell .",
    "furthermore , since the region involved in @xmath162 ( the gross amplitude ) is @xmath163 , this amplitude is not crucially affected by the pronounced peak of the meson form - factor .",
    "the spectator equation solutions are then not affected by the spurious singularities for the form - factors , as announced in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .      as a consequence of the above results , we tailored alternative choices for the meson and nucleon form - factors .",
    "we tested two different models : model a combines the pion form - factor of eq .",
    "( [ fpi3 ] ) with the nucleon form - factor of eq .",
    "( [ fn2 ] ) ; in model b the pion form - factor of eq .",
    "( [ multipole ] ) with @xmath133 is used together with the nucleon form - factor of eq .",
    "( [ fn2 ] ) . since those form - factors have no singularities in the @xmath32 variable , the only terms to be considered in the amplitudes calculation are given by the decompositions of eqs .",
    "( [ mi ] ) and ( [ mii ] ) .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , model a preserves the spectator amplitude @xmath70 .",
    "nevertheless it changes crucially the remaining amplitudes relatively the models of reference @xcite .",
    "models a and b give in general very similar results as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ abcomp1 ] and [ abcomp2 ] , with the exception of the gross amplitude in the @xmath137 channel .",
    "anyhow , since equal conclusions can be drawn from both models , we present only the final results for model a.    from figs .",
    "[ modeloa0 ] and [ modeloa1 ] it is clear that the exact and gross amplitudes do differ much less than in the model considered in the previous sub - section . they are now of the same order of magnitude , being the difference between them of the same order of obe scalar exchange amplitude ( @xmath154 100 @xmath155 ) , which gives the hope that the spectator - on - mass - shell prescription can be easily improved through the inclusion of obe - type terms in the kernel . from the same figures we conclude that the box amplitude is dominant for the @xmath144 channel , although the crossed - box amplitude is by no means negligible for the @xmath137 channel .    having found a way of preserving the unitary condition , we can now analyze relativistic contributions such as retardation , given by @xmath164 ( box ) and @xmath165 ( crossed - box ) , and nucleon negative - energy states , given by @xmath166 ( box ) and @xmath167 ( crossed - box ) .    in figs .",
    "[ boxani=0 ] and [ boxani=1 ] we separately show those effects for the box amplitude , and in the fig .",
    "[ crossani=0 ] and [ crossani=1 ] for the crossed - box amplitude . for the box amplitude",
    "the meson pole contributions are always important , and with opposite sign to the total amplitude .",
    "we conclude that in this case retardation effects can not be neglected .",
    "the nucleon negative - energy state contributions are now very much suppressed relatively to the case of sec .",
    "[ pvold ] , and typically of the order of @xmath154 15% . for the crossed - box amplitude ,",
    "the meson poles and negative energy contributions are smaller than for the box , and have a partial important cancelation between them , giving rise to a net small result .",
    "this last cancellation decreases slowly with increasing energy .",
    "recently , methods based on path - integral techniques allowed field - theory calculations , including ladder and crossed - ladder series , for scalar particles to be performed to all orders @xcite .",
    "when the status of the calculations will reach the point of dealing with dirac particles and general couplings , the comparison of their results with the ones obtained with different quasi - potential formalisms will clarify the unsettled point of selecting between different covariant formulations , for the description of nuclear systems .    in the meantime we decided to perform a study to quantify",
    "how well the amplitudes , calculated within the spectator - on - mass - shell formalism , represent the exact ones when dirac particles interact through boson - exchange , in particular pion - exchange .",
    "this will eventually orient us towards possible required corrections , which may get increasingly important at higher energies , namely above the pion production threshold .",
    "we considered here two - pion exchange contributions not included in the spectator - on - mass - shell formalism .",
    "we aimed to check whether they can be included in a kernel restricted to have the obe form , such that they can more easily be incorporated in current calculations and present - day computer codes .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are :    1 .",
    "the form - factors of the effective nn models calibrated with the spectator equations can not be used to investigate the quality of the spectator amplitudes , since the corresponding crossed - box and subtracted - box amplitudes , required for this study , strongly violate unitarity .",
    "2 .   for the same reason the above nn models are not adequate for use in extensions of the kernel that include crossed - box and subtracted - box terms . 3 .   with appropriate choices of the form - factors , meaning no unitary violation ,",
    "the difference between the full and gross fourth - order amplitudes is of the order of magnitude of typical obe scalar exchange amplitudes , raising the expectation that this difference may be parameterized by this type of exchange terms .",
    "the study of possible improvements of the spectator - on - mass - shell prescription , through the inclusion of obe - type terms in the integral equation kernel , is planned for the near future .",
    "4 .   there is a crucial ( energy - dependent ) interplay between retardation effects and nucleon negative - energy state contributions in the box and crossed - box diagrams , which does not allow the ladder approximation to work well as a representation of the exact bethe - salpeter series ( ladder plus crossed - ladder ) .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of nieuwenhuis et al .",
