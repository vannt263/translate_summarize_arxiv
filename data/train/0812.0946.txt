    "it is well known that studies of production of photons with large transverse momenta producing in the hard interaction between photon and parton or between two partons in @xmath0 collisions , so - called prompt photon production , provide precision tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as well as information on the parton densities within a proton and a photon .",
    "also , these studies are our potential for the observation of a new dynamical regime , namely the high - energy regge limit , which is characterized by the following condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total collision energy in the center of mass reference frame , @xmath3 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd , @xmath4 is the typical energy scale of the hard interaction . at this high - energy limit , the contribution from the partonic subprocesses involving @xmath5channel parton ( quark or gluon ) exchanges to the production cross section can become dominant",
    ". in the region under consideration , the transverse momenta of the incoming partons and their off - shell properties can no longer be neglected , and we deal with `` reggeized '' @xmath5channel partons .",
    "we consider the quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) approach @xcite , which is similar to the @xmath6factorization approach @xcite conceptually , as the theoretical framework for this kind of high - energy phenomenology .",
    "our previous analysis of charmonium and bottomonium production at the fermilab tevatron and desy hera colliders @xcite , and the study of prompt photon production at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , using the high - energy factorization scheme have shown the appreciation of the method even at the leading order ( lo ) in the strong - coupling constant @xmath7 in compare with the experimental data .",
    "we have found that the essential features produced by the high - energy factorization scheme at the lo are being at the next - to - leading ( nlo ) in the conventional collinear parton model .",
    "contrary to the @xmath6factorization scheme , based on the well - known prescription for off - shell @xmath5channel gluons @xcite , the qmrk approach seems to be more proper theoretically @xcite . in this approach we work with gauge invariant amplitudes and",
    "use the factorization hypothesis , which is proved in the leading - logarithmic - approximation ( lla ) . in the qmrk approach",
    "we can do calculationss with reggeized quarks @xcite , that presents an open question in the @xmath6factorization approach , following which we can operate correctly with off - shell gluons only .",
    "recently it was shown also , that the calculation in the nlo in strong coupling constant within the framework of qmrk approach can be done @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the inclusive photoproduction of prompt photon within the framework of the qmrk approach , applying the quark and gluon reggeization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "we describe accurately and without free parameters the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity spectra of prompt photons in the inclusive photoproduction at the hera collider @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the main mechanism of the inclusive prompt photon production in the @xmath8 collisions is the fusion of a reggeized quark ( antiquark ) from the proton and a collinear antiquark ( quark ) from the photon into a photon , via the effective reggeon - quark - gamma vertex .",
    "the fragmentation of the quark , which is produced via the gamma - reggeon - quark and quark - reggeon - quark vertices , into a photon is strongly suppressed by the isolation cone condition and it gives a significant contribution in the region of a large negative pseudorapidity only . at the stage of numerical calculations we use the kimber - martin - ryskin prescription for unintegrated quark and gluon distribution functions @xcite , with the following collinear densities as input : mrst for a proton @xcite and grv for a photon @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , the relevant reggeon - reggeon - particle and particle - reggeon - particle effective vertices are presented and discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , we describe the inclusive photon photoproduction at the hera collider . in sec .",
    "[ sec : foure ] , we compare our approach with the similar calculations in the @xmath6factorization scheme . in sec .",
    "[ sec : five ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in the phenomenology of strong interactions at high energies , it is necessary to describe the qcd evolution of the parton distribution functions of the colliding particles starting with some scale @xmath9 , which controls a nonperturbative regime , to the typical scale @xmath4 of the hard - scattering processes , which is typically of the order of the transverse mass @xmath10 of the produced particle with mass @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath12 . in the region of very high energies , in the so - called regge limit , the typical ratio @xmath13 becomes very small , @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to large logarithmic contributions of the type @xmath15^n$ ] in the resummation procedure , which is described by the bfkl evolution equation @xcite or other bfkl - like ones for an unintegrated gluon ( quark ) distribution functions @xmath16 .",
    "correspondingly , in the qmrk approach @xcite , the initial - state @xmath17-channel gluons and quarks are considered as reggeons , or as reggeized gluons @xmath18 and as reggeized quarks @xmath19 .",
    "they are off - mass shell and carry finite transverse two - momenta @xmath20 with respect to the hadron beam from which they stem .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the feynman rules for the effective theory based on the non - abelian gauge - invariant action @xcite were derived for the induced and some important effective vertices .",
    "however , these rules include processes with reggeized gluons in the initial state only . in case of @xmath17-channel quark exchange processes such rules",
    "are absent today , in spite of that the gauge - invariant action for reggeized quarks is known @xcite , and it is needed to construct effective vertices with the reggeized quarks , using qmrk approach prescriptions , every time from the beginning .",
    "of course , a certain set of reggeon - reggeon - particle effective vertices is known , for example , for the transitions @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite .    roughly speaking , the reggeization of amplitudes is a trick that offers an opportunity to take into account efficiently large radiation corrections to the processes under regge limit condition outside the collinear approximation .",
    "the particle reggeization is known in high energy quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) for electrons only @xcite and for gluon and quarks in qcd @xcite .",
    "the effective vertex @xmath24 , which describes the production of a single gluon with momentum @xmath25 in the reggeized quark and reggeized antiquark annihilation was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and it can be presented , omitting the color and lorentz indexes in the left side , as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are colliding hadron momenta , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the reggeized quark momenta are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "it is obvious that this vertex satisfies the gauge - invariant condition @xmath33 .    like the gluon production",
    ", the effective vertex for photon production can be written in the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath36 is the quark electric charge .",
    "the effective vertex , which describes the production of a quark with momentum @xmath37 in a virtual photon collision with a reggeized quark can be presented as follows @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath31 is the reggeized quark four - momentum and the gauge invariance condition is given by @xmath39 for a mass - shell photon the vertex ( [ eq : gammaqq ] ) can be presented in the form : @xmath40 the effective reggeon - reggeon - particle vertex , which describes the production of a quark with momentum @xmath41 in the reggeized quark and reggeized gluon collision can be presented as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44)-([eq : rqq ] ) .",
    "the relevant squared matrix elements can be presented as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the azimuthal angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "[ sec : three ]    in this part we consider the inclusive prompt photon production at the hera collider in the region of a small exchange photon virtuality @xmath51 gev@xmath52 , i.e. in the photoproduction processes .",
    "working in the lo qmrk approach we describe data applying the quark and gluon reggeization hypothesis .",
    "there are two main mechanisms of prompt photon production in this approach : the production of direct photons and the production of photons via fragmentation . in the first case ,",
    "photons are produced directly via fusion of a reggeized quark and a reggeized antiquark , which stem from a proton ( photon ) and a photon ( proton ) : @xmath53 in the second case , photons are produced in the quark or gluon fragmentation into the photon , which is described by the parton to photon fragmentation functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite . in the discussed here task",
    "the gluon fragmentation into the photon is unimportant and we will take into account the quark(antiquark ) fragmentation only : @xmath56    the factorization formulas for the production cross section of the direct photons ( [ eq : direct ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath57    in the case of fragmentation production mechanism we have two formulas for the `` direct '' ( [ eq : resolved1 ] ) and the `` resolved '' ( [ eq : resolved2],[eq : resolved3 ] ) contributions : @xmath58 @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the unintegrated quark or gluon distribution in a photon , which is calculated using kmr@xcite prescription , the same as the unintegrated quark or gluon distribution in a proton @xmath61 , @xmath62 denotes the photon flux integrated over @xmath63 from the kinematic limit of @xmath64 to the upper limit @xmath65 gev@xmath52 ; @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the proton and electron energies in the laboratory frame .",
    "we use the following collinear densities as input : mrst @xcite for a proton and grv @xcite for a photon .",
    "the exact formula for @xmath62 is taken as follows : @xmath71\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] to calculate transverse momentum and pseudorapidity spectra in the photoproduction of the direct photon we use the following formula , which is obtained from ( [ f : direct ] ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the produced photon four - momentum , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76    in case of the fragmentation production mechanism the master formulas can be obtained from ( [ f : direct2 ] ) , and ( [ f : resolved ] ) and they have the following forms : @xmath77 where @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80    the requirement of particle reggeization demands fulfilment of the conditions @xmath81 for partons both from a proton and a photon in the discussed here processes .",
    "as example , in case of the direct photon production we can write : @xmath82 where for the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite measurements : @xmath83 gev , @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 , @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 . if we take the fixed median values : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 gev , we obtain that @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "in such a way , the particle reggeization should be used for partons from a proton only , and partons from a photon have been considered in the collinear approximation , as usually in the conventional parton model .    in that case",
    "all master formulas can be rewrited using the following prescriptions : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the collinear parton density in a photon @xcite , and we need to take @xmath96 in the all kinematic relations and in the squared matrix elements .    to compare the theoretical predictions and the data we need to take into account carefully kinematic conditions and cuts of the discussed experiments @xcite .",
    "the special attention should be attracted to the isolation cone condition @xmath97 @xcite , where @xmath98 is the total transverse energy of a jet with the detected photon , @xmath99 is the non - photon energy in this jet .",
    "it is obvious that the isolation cone condition needs the inequality @xmath100 to be fulfilled in the case of fragmentation production mechanism .",
    "this cut on the fragmentation parameter @xmath101 strongly suppresses the contribution of the fragmentation production .",
    "however , the isolation cone condition should be taken into account and in the production of direct photons too .",
    "the measured transverse energy @xmath98 includes additional non - photon part which is order of @xmath99 @xcite , thus we can put @xmath102 , if the theoretical prediction corresponds to the photon transverse momentum @xmath103 .",
    "we compare the results of our calculations with the data from zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations .",
    "figures ( [ fig:1])([fig:4 ] ) demonstrate an agreement between the theory and the data , especially for the transverse - energy spectra .",
    "we use the following notation for the curves : 1 is the resolved production of the direct photons in the subprocesses ( [ eq : direct ] ) ; 2 is the direct production via the fragmentation in the subprocesses ( [ eq : resolved1 ] ) ; 3 is the resolved production via the fragmentation in the subprocesses ( [ eq : resolved2 ] ) and ( [ eq : resolved3 ] ) ; 4 is the sum of all contributions .    in the transverse energy distribution",
    "the mechanism of the direct photon production ( curve 1 ) is dominant at the all @xmath104 and the fragmentation contribution ( curves 2 and 3 ) is only about @xmath105 of the first one , that is in accordance to the previous calculations in the nlo of the collinear parton model @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation production mechanism gives significant contribution only at the large negative values of @xmath106 in the pseudorapidity distribution .",
    "we see that in this region the @xmath107spectrum can be described correctly if we take into account both the direct ( curve 1 ) and fragmentation ( curves 2 and 3 ) mechanisms .",
    "we have obtained that the data lie slightly higher our predictions in case of the zeus measurements at all values of pseudorapidity , see fig.([fig:3 ] ) . in case of the h1 measurements the small disagreement is observed in the central region of pseudorapidity @xmath108 only , see fig.([fig:4 ] ) .    the small visible disagreement for the @xmath107spectra should be explained that we do not use in our calculation the cone isolation condition in the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle plane @xmath109 where @xmath110 @xcite , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle of a hadron from the detected photon jet .",
    "contrary to the collinear parton model calculation , where the lo processes are @xmath113 ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 , ... ) , the lo processes in the qmrk approach are @xmath116 ( @xmath117 , ... ) .",
    "the all quark and gluon jets are absorbed in the unintegrated distribution functions of a proton and a photon .",
    "thus , our prediction corresponds correctly the production of `` pure '' direct photons and it is unclear how to take into account the cone isolation condition ( [ eq : cone ] ) . comparing the theoretical predictions and the data we should take into account that the zeus and h1 data contain arbitrary small part ( @xmath118 ) of the non - photon events .",
    "[ sec : foure ]    in this section , we compare our results with the previous study in the @xmath6factorization scheme , which is similar to the qmrk approach .",
    "the calculation of the inclusive prompt photon production at the hera collider was performed using off - shell amplitudes involving initial quarks in the ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper ,",
    "a compton process of the off - shell quark ",
    "photon scattering @xmath119 was considered as the lo direct photon production process .",
    "we especially used here different denotations for the reggeized particles ( @xmath120 ) and off - shell particles ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "it means that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the conventional qcd vertices are used and the authors obtained gauge uninvariant amplitudes . the gauge invariant condition for amplitudes controls the correct @xmath122 dependence of the relevant cross sections . the arbitrary inclusion of the @xmath122 effects in the kinematics only , without the using of the correct vertices for reggeized particle interactions can be considered as a phenomenological trick , but such inclusion does not have predictive power .",
    "the additional important remark to the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite : the contribution of the lo process @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) was ignored .",
    "we see that this contribution is dominant and the comparison of theoretical predictions with data without taking it into account is ungrounded .    the compton scattering of photons on reggeized quarks , @xmath125 is a nlo process in the qmrk approach . to calculate it we need to solve the same problems as for other nlo reggeon - reggeon to particle - particle processes in the qmrk approch .",
    "firstly , it is necessary to obtain the relevant effective vertex .",
    "this task has not been solved yet .",
    "of course , the relevant process is lo if we study the associated photon plus jet , both with large transverse momenta production .",
    "however , in that case the effective vertex should be constructed too .",
    "[ sec : five ]    it is shown that it is possible to describe data in the lo qmrk approach for prompt photon spectra for the inclusive photoproduction in the high - energy @xmath0 collisions at the hera collider .",
    "the used here scheme of a calculation have been suggested recently in our paper @xcite , in which we described successfully the deep inelastic structure functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 of the lepton - proton scattering and prompt photon spectra for the inclusive production in the @xmath128 collisions at the tevatron collider .",
    "our results demonstrate that the quark reggeization hypothesis is a very powerful tool in the high energy phenomenology for the hard processes involving quark exchanges .",
    "we thank l.  lipatov and m.  ryskin for the critical remarks and useful discussion of the questions under consideration in this paper .",
