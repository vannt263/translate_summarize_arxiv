    "instanton bundles were introduced in @xcite on @xmath3 and in @xcite on @xmath0 .",
    "recently many authors have been dealing with them .",

    "authors of @xcite study the stability of instanton bundles .",
    "they prove that all special symplectic instanton bundles on @xmath0 are stable and all instanton bundles on @xmath4 are stable . some computations involving instanton bundles",
    "can be done using computer programs , e.g. macaulay , as it is presented in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-action on the moduli space of special instanton bundles on @xmath6 is described in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the moduli space of symplectic instanton bundles on @xmath0 is affine , by introducing the invariant that we use in this paper .",
    "as we see , instanton bundles were discussed in many papers .",
    "on @xmath3 they have rank @xmath7 and they are symplectic . on @xmath0 , for @xmath8 , theoretically they can be divided in three groups : symplectic , orthogonal and neither symplectic nor orthogonal bundles .",
    "lots of examples of symplectic bundles are known as well as of bundles from the third group .",
    "however , it was not known whether there exist orthogonal instanton bundles .",
    "we prove , see theorem [ mainthm ] , that it s impossible for such bundles to exist .",
    "the question was posed by trautmann in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the preliminaries",
    "we give definitions of instanton bundle , orthogonal instanton bundle and symplectic instanton bundle .",
    "we state equivalent conditions for a bundle to be respectively orthogonal or symplectic .",
    "in the main part we prove the fact that there do not exist orthogonal instanton bundles on @xmath0 for an arbitrary @xmath9 and arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a smooth projective variety .",
    "a _ monad _ on @xmath11 is a complex of vector bundles : @xmath12 which is exact at @xmath13 and at @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a vector space of dimension @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be vector spaces of dimension @xmath20 and let @xmath21 be a vector space of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the following monad on @xmath0 : @xmath23    note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be represented by two matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath26 and @xmath28 are @xmath29-matrices with linear entries of maximal rank for every point in @xmath0 and @xmath30 .",
    "the condition for @xmath26 and @xmath28 to be of maximal rank for every point in @xmath0 is equivalent to require that the map @xmath24 is surjective and the map @xmath25 is injective .    from now on , with a little abuse of notation",
    ", we will identify a linear map @xmath24 with the matrix @xmath26 associated to it , and we will simply write @xmath26 .",
    "we say that @xmath31 is an _ instanton bundle _",
    "( with quantum number @xmath20 ) if @xmath31 is the cohomology of a monad as in ( [ monad ] ) , i.e. @xmath32    * for an instanton bundle @xmath31 we have that @xmath33 . *",
    "the chern polynomial of @xmath31 is @xmath34 + in particular , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "* @xmath37 has natural cohomology in the range @xmath38 , i.e. + @xmath39 for at most one @xmath40 .",
    "[ def : ort ] we say that an instanton bundle @xmath31 is _ symplectic _ if there exists an isomorphism @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "we say that an instanton bundle @xmath31 is _ orthogonal _ if there exists an isomorphism @xmath41 such that @xmath43 .",
    "having a symplectic instanton bundle is equivalent to the existence of a non - degenerate , skew - symmetric matrix @xmath44 such that @xmath45 . after linear change of coordinates",
    "we may assume that @xmath44 is of the form    @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "having an orthogonal instanton bundle is equivalent to the existence of a non - degenerate , symmetric matrix @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "recalling the definition we gave before , having an orthogonal instanton bundle means having an application @xmath50 with the additional properties that @xmath51 , and @xmath26 has maximal rank for every point in @xmath0 .",
    "let us choose a basis for each vector space we are considering . in particular",
    "we have @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 as a basis of @xmath19 , @xmath55 , @xmath53 , @xmath56 as a basis of @xmath21 and @xmath57 , @xmath53 , @xmath58 as a basis of @xmath15 .    from the map defined in ( [ def:1 ] ) we can induce a second map @xmath59 over the global sections where @xmath60 is a @xmath61-matrix .",
    "we want to construct such matrix in a particular way , i.e. @xmath62 where , fixed @xmath63 , the block @xmath64 is a @xmath65-matrix `` associated '' to the element @xmath66 of the basis of @xmath19 . in other words",
    "the block @xmath64 represents the following correspondence : @xmath67    using the matrix @xmath60 it is possible to reconstruct the quadratic conditions given by @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , let us observe that the matrix @xmath26 can be described by the following matrix @xmath69 \\cdot m_1 \\\\ \\hline \\vdots \\\\ \\hline   \\left[x_0 , \\ldots , x_{2n+1}\\right ] \\cdot m_k \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath70 are the coordinates in @xmath15 with respect to the basis @xmath71 , @xmath53 , @xmath72 .",
    "the most natural idea is to consider the product @xmath73 , that is of the form @xmath74 where each block @xmath75 , for @xmath24 , @xmath76 , @xmath53 , @xmath20 , is a square matrix representing a quadratic form in the variables @xmath77 , @xmath53 , @xmath78 .",
    "because of this considerations , we can state the following equivalence of quadratic conditions @xmath79    let us observe , as in @xcite , that the vector spaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 have the same dimension @xmath82 , where we denote by @xmath83 the @xmath9-th symmetric power of @xmath19 .",
    "we can induce from @xmath59 the morphisms @xmath84 @xmath85 with @xmath86 denoting the natural projection , and we consider the composition @xmath87    we recall a result stated in @xcite , that , in our situation , is the following    [ teo:1 ] if we have an instanton bundle given by @xmath26 , then @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 is non - degenerate .",
    "@xmath90 is @xmath91-invariant .",
    "as we did for @xmath60 , we construct the matrix associated to @xmath89 .",
    "first of all we fix the lexicographic order induced by @xmath92 on the elements of the basis of @xmath93 and on the elements of the basis of @xmath94 .",
    "we label with @xmath95 the elements of @xmath93 and by @xmath96 the elements of @xmath94 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we decompose @xmath89 in @xmath99 blocks of dimension @xmath100 .",
    "the block @xmath101 , is the matrix that represents the linear map @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we will see later , with more details , that each block @xmath101 is either one of the @xmath64 blocks or the matrix of all zeros .",
    "[ fact:1 ] considering the matrix @xmath89 we have constructed , there always exists a syzygy @xmath105 with @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in particular , we are going to demonstrate that the map @xmath109 , represented by a @xmath110-matrix of the form @xmath111 will accomplish the property we are looking for .",
    "we are going to abuse some language now , because remembering that @xmath89 is divided by blocks , from now on we will refer to a column of blocks of @xmath89 as a column of @xmath89 and , the same way , to a row of blocks of @xmath89 as a row of @xmath89 .",
    "+ we observe that each column of @xmath89 is related to an element of the basis of @xmath83 and each row is related to an element of the basis @xmath112 .",
    "we advice to take a look at the next example to have a better understanding of all the constructions we made .    in order to prove that the map @xmath109 , defined in ( [ syzygy ] ) , is such that @xmath113 , we have only to look at the first @xmath20 columns of @xmath89 .",
    "this means that we just need to check all possible passages from the basis elements @xmath114 to all the element of the basis of @xmath112 of the form @xmath115 .",
    "let us observe that we are only considering all the elements of the two basis that contain the monomial @xmath116 .",
    "we now have two options :    * we can get every element of @xmath112 of the type @xmath117 , for @xmath118 , @xmath53 , @xmath20 , from an element of @xmath119 , only multiplying @xmath120 by @xmath121 .",
    "+ this means that the only non - vanishing block of the row of @xmath89 corresponding to the element @xmath117 will be a block @xmath122 in the @xmath24-th column . multiplying this row by @xmath109",
    "we will obtain @xmath123 which is zero for each @xmath24 , because of the quadratic relations .",
    "* we can get the elements of @xmath112 of the type @xmath124 , @xmath125 in only two different ways : multiplying @xmath120 by @xmath126 or multiplying @xmath127 by @xmath121 . +",
    "this means that the only non - vanishing blocks of the row of @xmath89 corresponding to the element @xmath128 will be a block @xmath122 in the @xmath25-th column and a block @xmath129 in the @xmath24-th column .",
    "multiplying this row by @xmath109 we will obtain @xmath130 which is zero for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 , because of the quadratic relations .",
    "because of everything we said , the fact [ fact:1 ] is proved .",
    "from fact [ fact:1 ] we have that the kernel of @xmath89 is not zero , so @xmath131 .",
    "this gives us a contradiction with theorem [ teo:1 ] .",
    "due to all our previous work , we can state    [ mainthm ] there do not exist orthogonal instanton bundles @xmath31 on @xmath2 , for each @xmath20 , @xmath9 @xmath132 @xmath133 .",
    "[ [ example . ] ] * example . *",
    "+ + + + + + + + + +    we want to write the following simple case in order to give to the reader a better understanding of the previous proof .",
    "it is known that for @xmath134 , see @xcite , there do not exist instanton bundles , so taking a simple case , we consider an instanton bundle @xmath31 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "in this particular case we have a map @xmath59 with @xmath60 a @xmath140-matrix . remembering what we said before",
    ", @xmath60 will have the form @xmath141 in this case , we consider the map @xmath142 induced by @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath89 is represented by a square matrix of order 120 .",
    "basing on what we have said , @xmath89 will have the following form @xmath143 q =(    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) @xmath143 where the empty entries represent @xmath144-matrices of zeros .",
    "we observe that in the bottom and right part of the matrix we can see , respectively , the elements of the basis of @xmath145 related to the columns of @xmath89 and the elements of the basis of @xmath146 related to the rows of @xmath89 .",
    "taking in mind the quadratic conditions expressed in ( [ eq:1 ] ) , it is immediate to check that @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
