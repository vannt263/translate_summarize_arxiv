    "after the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 , the phase space of searching for the long - sought higgs boson has been replaced by the phase space of measuring the properties of this new boson , including yukawa coupling with the top quark . the fact that the top quark has the largest mass in the standard model has convinced us of its important role for checking the consistency of the higgs boson with the standard model predictions .",
    "one of the most promising channels for a direct measurement of the top quark s yukawa coupling is the production of a top - quark pair in association with the higgs boson .",
    "the higgs boson which decays to @xmath4 in the standard model will lead to a @xmath0 final state .",
    "this final state , which has not yet been observed using run i ( 2010 - 2012 ) data , has an irreducible nonresonant background from the production of a top quark pair in association with two jets faking b jets or with a b quark pair .",
    "the expected cross section for @xmath2 in pp collisions at @xmath5 = 8 tev to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is @xmath6 ( scale ) @xmath7 0.010 pb ( pdf+@xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "calculations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been performed to nlo precision . @xmath9 and @xmath10 predictions at @xmath5 = 8 tev are and  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath9 is @xmath11 . in this calculation",
    ", the additional jets must have transverse momenta and absolute pseudorapidity @xmath12 @xmath13 2.5 .",
    "the dominant uncertainties in these calculations are from the factorization and the renormalization scales caused by the presence of two very different scales in this process , the top quark mass and the jet @xmath14 scales .",
    "the first measurements of the cross sections @xmath10 and @xmath9 and their ratios were presented by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) by using the full data sample of pp collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 8 tev , which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb@xmath3 .",
    "the measured cross sections of @xmath10 and @xmath9 in the same phase space as in the theory calculation are and , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the measured cross section ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath9 is 0.022 @xmath7 0.004 ( stat . ) @xmath7 0.005 ( syst . ) , which is compatible within 1.6 standard deviation with the theory prediction of @xmath11 .    a large number of top quark candidates is expected to be produced at the lhc even during the early run ii period ( 2015 - 2017 ) .",
    "this will allow us to measure these processes in great detail . therefore performing",
    "the same measurement at 13 tev is important because the experimental measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 production can provide a good test of nlo qcd theory and an important input about the main background in the search for the @xmath2 process .",
    "this study will also provide useful information about the main background in the search for new physics beyond the standard model , such as the flavor - changing neutral current process where one of the top quarks decays to an up ( or charm ) quark and a higgs boson and the higgs boson decays to a bottom - quark pair .    in this paper , we present a fast - simulation study of the @xmath0 process and compare it with the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 processes .",
    "the differential distributions of additional b jets from @xmath0 events are compared with the differential distributions of b jets from @xmath1 events and from @xmath2 events where the higgs decays to a bottom - quark pair .",
    "the simulated pp collision data samples for three processes , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are produced separately at a center - of - mass energy of 13 tev .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath2 samples are generated by using the madgraph5_amc@nlo ( v2.1.2 )  @xcite framework at the nlo level and are further interfaced with pythia ( v8.185 ) for the hadronization .",
    "the @xmath1 samples for the differential distributions are generated by using madgraph5 at leading order due to the limit of computer resources interfaced with pythia ( v6.428 ) for the hadronization .",
    "for @xmath0 and @xmath2 samples , 100k events are produced while for @xmath1 sample , 1 m events are produced .",
    "a transverse momentum threshold of 20 @xmath15 and a pseudo - rapidity @xmath12 @xmath13 2.5 for the additional jets that are not from top quarks are applied at the production level .",
    "the additional jets in the @xmath1 events include b quarks as well as light flavor quarks and a gluon .",
    "for the @xmath0 events , the events are generated in a 4-flavor scheme , where the b quark is treated as having the mass . in the @xmath0 events",
    ", there must be at least two additional b jets with a threshold of 20 @xmath15 . in the @xmath2 events ,",
    "the decay of the higgs boson is handled in pythia .",
    "the cross sections of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes at @xmath16 = 13 tev are calculated to nlo within the madgraph5_amc@nlo framework .",
    "the cross sections are 224 @xmath7 1.8 pb for the @xmath1 process , 4.7 pb for the @xmath0 process , and 0.32 pb for the @xmath2 process at @xmath5 = 13 tev .",
    "these cross sections are used to calculate the significance by normalizing the number of events to data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath3 .",
    "the generated events are processed for the detector simulation with the delphes package ( v3.1.2 )  @xcite for the cms detector .",
    "similar to the cms reconstruction , the objects from the particle - flow algorithm implemented in delphes are used throughout this analysis .",
    "the pileup events are available and can be merged in the simulated events in the delphes package . however , in this analysis , we assume that pileup mitigation , which will be developed at the cms experiment , can reduce the effect from pileup events significantly .",
    "it is also important to understand the physics difference in the case of no pileup events .",
    "therefore , we focus on only the physics under the condition that there is no pileup effect . in the delphes",
    "fast simulation , the final momenta of all the physics objects , such as electrons , muons and jets , are smeared as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath17 so that they can represent the detector effects in the cms experiment .",
    "the reconstruction efficiencies of the electrons , muons and jets are also parameterized as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath17 based on information from the measurements using run 1 data .",
    "the muon identification efficiency is set to 95% for the muons with momenta @xmath14 @xmath18 10 @xmath15 and @xmath14 @xmath13 100 @xmath15 .",
    "the electron identification efficiency is set to 95% for @xmath12 @xmath18 1.5 and 85% for 1.5 @xmath13",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 2.5 the isolated muons and electrons are selected by applying a relative isolation of @xmath19 @xmath13 0.1 , where @xmath19 is defined as the sum of the surrounding energy from the particle - flow tracks , photons and neutral hadrons divided by the transverse momentum of the muon or electron .",
    "the particle - flow jets used in this analysis are clustered by using the particle - flow tracks and particle - flow towers .",
    "if the jet is already reconstructed as an isolated electron , muon or photon , the jet is excluded from further consideration . the b - tagging efficiency parameterized as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath17 of the jet ranges from 20% to 50% .",
    "the fake b - tagging rate from the light flavor jet is set to 0.1% , which corresponds to the tight - working point in the cms measurement  @xcite .",
    "in order to constrain the phase space to that we can experimentally measure in the dileptonic decay mode , we applied the following event selections at the reconstruction level .",
    "events should have at least two leptons with @xmath20 @xmath15 and @xmath12 @xmath13 2.4 ( s1 ) .",
    "four reconstructed jets with @xmath21 @xmath15 and @xmath12 @xmath13 2.5 are required ( s2 ) .",
    "two b - tagged jets are required to select the @xmath22 events ( s3 ) .",
    "after this selection step , based on the experimental result from the cms experiment  @xcite , we would still have remaining backgrounds from single - top events and drell - yan events . in order to remove these possible remaining backgrounds and to be sure we have only @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 events after the final selection",
    ", we further require the event to have one more b - tagged jet , adding up to at least three b - tagged jets ( s4 ) .    in the best scenario where we can identify the origin of the b jets , we can see the potential difference in the kinematic distributions of the additional jets not from top quarks for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes . for this purpose , we rely on the monte carlo information to identify the origin of the jets as to whether or not they come from a top quark .",
    "the additional jets not from top quarks are identified by using the geometric information @xmath23 , requiring @xmath24 @xmath13 0.5 , where @xmath25 denotes jets at the reconstruction level and @xmath26 denotes a quark that does not originate from top quarks .",
    "if the jet matches the b quark , it is treated as a b jet .",
    "otherwise , the jet is treated as a light flavor jets .",
    "plots for this analysis are shown at the preselection owing to the lack of statistics in our simulated samples and to the tight selection based on the assumption that the distributions would not be significantly different after the event selections .",
    "figure  [ fig1_1 ] shows the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity distributions for two jets that are not from top quarks .",
    "the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig1_1 ] show that the additional b jets in the @xmath0 event tend to have softer @xmath14 compared to those from the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 events .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity distributions from the @xmath0 events are shown to be more central than those from the other processes .",
    "the invariant mass and @xmath24 distributions for these two jets are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1_2 ] .",
    "as expected , the invariant mass of the two b jets from the higgs boson in the @xmath2 process has a clear peak around 125 @xmath27 , the simulated mass in the @xmath2 sample , while that is not the case for the other two processes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath24 distribution shows a clear distinguishing feature .",

    ", identifying the origin of the b jets at the reconstruction level with the real data events remains challenging . because in a real data analysis , no single best variable would be able to separate the @xmath2 process from the @xmath0 or @xmath1 process , this would require us to perform a multivariate analysis to increase the significance . in the multivariate analysis ,",

    "the significances become compatible with each other for both channels .",
