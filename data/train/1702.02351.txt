    "we demonstrate successful complete intercalation of oxygen under graphene on ni(111 ) .",

    "the partial pressure of oxygen in the preparation chamber measured by the hot - cathode ion gauge was @xmath15 mbar or @xmath16 mbar .",
    "the duration of this procedure determined the amount of intercalated oxygen ; however , comparison with the preparations conditions which were used for oxygen intercalation in gr / ru(0001 )  @xcite shows that for the formation of the fully decoupled layer of graphene on ni(111 ) the oxygen dose has to be at least by factor of 10 higher compared to the former case . this difference is addressed in sec .",
