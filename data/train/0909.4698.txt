    "in the sm of electroweak interactions(ew ) there are spontaneous symmetry breaking , higgs , and faddeev - popov procedure .",
    "the theory is successful in many aspects . however , there is no experimental indication for existence of higgs .",
    "other theoretical approaches : supersymmetry models , technichcolor , little higgs , top quark condensate etc . have been proposed to modify the sm . in this talk a new possible ew theory without introducing any unknown factors is discussed . in both qed or qcd",
    "there are three parts : gauge fields , massive fermion fields , and interactions between them .",
    "they are two very successful quantum field theories .",
    "so far , three parts of the theory of ew interactions @xmath0 gauge fields , massive fermion fields , and the interactions between @xmath0 gauge fields and fermions are indeed confirmed experimentally .",
    "therefore , it is worth to study the lagrangian of ew interactions without spontaneous symmetry breaking and higgs  @xcite @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 the structure of this l is the same as qed and qcd .",
    "the difference is that the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken by fermion masses .",
    "the masses of w and z bosons can not be added by hand .",
    "the term @xmath6 of the propagator of massive gauge boson causes problems for renormalization and unitarity .",
    "the challenge for this theory is : generating the masses of gauge bosons while the terms(2 ) which causes quadratic divergence must be canceled .",
    "the masses of gauge bosons violate the gauge symmetry . in a gauge field theory",
    "they should be the effects of @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking . in eq.(1 )",
    "@xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken by the fermion masses .",
    "we need to study the relationship between the masses of gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "it is found that the fermion masses lead to a new mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this mechanism is inspired by weinberg s second sum rule obtained by current algebra  @xcite @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons are chiral partners and they are degenerate under chiral symmetry . obviously , weinberg s second sum rule implicates a new mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "current algebra is not a field theory .",
    "based on current algebra and qcd the lagrangian of a chiral field theory of pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons has been constructed as(in the case of two flavor )  @xcite @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 , m is the constituent quark mass which originates in quark condensate . in the limit",
    ", @xmath13 , the lagrangian(4 ) has global @xmath14 symmetry and the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 fields have the same mass . integrating out the quark fields ,",
    "the lagrangian of the mesons is derived , in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nonabelian gauge fields .",
    "this theory is phenomenologically successful .",
    "the mass relation between the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 mesons is derived @xmath15 where g is the universal coupling constant of this theory[3 ] , which is determined by the decay rate of @xmath16 .",
    "eq.(5 ) modifies weinberg s second sum rule . in ref.[2 ] weinberg made an assumption which is no longer required in this new theory[3 ] .",
    "this new formula fits the data better than eq.(3 ) .",
    "obviously , eq.(5 ) means a @xmath14 chiral symmetry breaking revealed from this theory(4 ) which is @xmath14 symmetric at tree level .",
    "how the @xmath8 meson gains additional mass and where the additional factor @xmath17 comes from ?",
    "the @xmath8 field is coupled to the axial - vector current of the massive fermion . because this current is not conserved the vacuum polarization of the @xmath8 field is expressed as @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the results of the nonconserved axial - vector current of the massive quark .",
    "they vanish when @xmath23 . because of nonconservation of the axial - vector current @xmath24 is different from the one of the @xmath9 field .",
    "@xmath24 is used to normalize the @xmath8 field and the additional factor is resulted in @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 eq.(5 ) is obtained .",
    "@xmath21 is finite and it is the gauge fixing of the nonabalian @xmath8 field .",
    "therefore , the gauge fixing and additional mass term of @xmath8 field are dynamically generated from this theory . in the lagrangian(4 ) there are no kinetic terms for the meson fields , which are generated from quark loop diagrams .",
    "the quark loop diagrams must be treated nonperturbatively . according to eq.(4 ) ,",
    "only one quark - loop diagrams are allowed to be calculated .",
    "the gauge fixing and additional mass term of @xmath8 field are nonperturbative solutions of this theory .",
    "this is the * new mechanism of symmetry breaking * : nonconserved axial - vector current of massive quark leads to nonperturbative generation of both new mass term and gauge fixing of the @xmath8 field . in ref.[3 ]",
    "the the vacuum polarization of the @xmath8 field has been calculated to the @xmath26 in covariant derivatives . besides the new mass form formula(5 )",
    "all the three terms of eq.(6 ) have been tested in studying @xmath8-related meson physics . without them pcac",
    "can not be satisfied in this theory .",
    "therefore , the mechanism is supported by @xmath8-related meson physics . on the other hand , if ignoring the term @xmath27 of eq.(3 ) , the mass of the gauge boson is via this mechanism dynamically generated by fermion mass , while the gauge fixing is simultaneously generated by this new mechanism to cancel the term which causes quadratic divergence .",
    "therefore , this mechanism does solve the problem mentioned above . in this mechanism fermion mass",
    "is the origin of the mass of gauge boson and gauge fixing .",
    "it has been studied in ref.[1 ] that the finite @xmath21 leads to a scalar field .",
    "a charged vector current of massive fermions is not conserved too .",
    "the vacuum polarization of a charged vector current of massive fermions takes the same expression as eq.(6 ) . besides @xmath28 there are @xmath21 and @xmath22 too and they vanish when the masses of fermions go to zero[1 ] .",
    "therefore , nonconserved charged vector current of massive fermions leads to nonperturbative generation of both new mass term and gauge fixing of the charged vector fields . in ref.[1 ] a model has been constructed to show this mechanism @xmath29 @xmath30 the amplitude of the vacuum polarization is derived @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 leads to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "the z - field is coupled to axial - vector currents of massive fermions and w - fields are coupled to charged vector currents of massive fermions .",
    "the new mechanism of symmetry breaking can be applied to this ew theory . in eq.(1 ) there are no mass terms for the gauge fields and the gague symmetries are broken by the fermion masses , the propagators of gauge bosons can not be defined and perturbation theory related to gauge fields can not be defined at the tree level . in order to construct the perturbation theory the vacuum polarizations of z- and w - fields",
