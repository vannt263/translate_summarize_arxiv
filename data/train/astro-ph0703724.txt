    "low - mass stars are self - gravitating gaseous ( or , rather , plasmatic ) bodies that develop electron - degenerate cores ( meaning that all low - lying energy states are filled and electron pressure is accordingly dominated by the pauli exclusion principle ) soon after leaving the main sequence ( ms ) phase , and hence undergo the so - called `` helium flash '' ( i.e. , ignition of the triple-@xmath0 process , whereby three alpha particles are converted into a @xmath1c nucleus , under degenerate conditions ) at the end of their evolution on the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "evolutionary calculations indicate that this corresponds to an upper mass limit @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "exceptionally , and as a consequence of extreme mass loss on the rgb , some such stars may directly become helium white dwarfs ( wd s ) before they are ever able to ignite helium in their degenerate cores ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . at the low - mass end , on the other hand , one finds that objects below @xmath3 are incapable of quiescent hydrogen burning .",
    "this corresponds to the commonly adopted `` dividing line '' between low - mass stars and the so - called brown dwarfs ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "empirically , the latter have recently been associated to the new spectral classes l ( @xcite ) and t ( @xcite ) .",
    "low - mass stars are of great astrophysical importance for a variety of reasons , which include the following :    * due to the shape of the so - called `` initial mass function '' ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent review ) , which gives the number of stars that are born in a given population as a function of mass , most stars in the universe are low - mass stars . as a consequence , and in spite of their lower individual masses , most of the baryonic mass in the universe currently in the form of stars is also contained in low - mass stars ( and their remnants ) , even though , to be sure , most baryonic mass actually appears to be in the form of gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , low - mass stars dominate the integrated light in old stellar systems , including elliptical galaxies and the spheroids ( bulges and halos ) of spiral galaxies . therefore ,",
    "in a very real sense , it is not possible to understand the properties of distant galaxies without adequate models of low - mass structure and evolution .",
    "* in the same token , ( bona - fide ) globular star clusters are almost exclusively comprised of low - mass stars . given that resolved galactic globular clusters have long been known ( @xcite ) to be the oldest objects in the universe for which reliable ages can be determined , they play a crucial cosmological role , since the oldest stars in the universe can not be older than the universe itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the latter , according to the latest results from the wmap experiment @xcite , is @xmath4  gyr old .",
    "cluster ages are determined by comparison of the observed color - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters with theoretical isochrones , especially around the so - called `` turn - off point '' ( see  [ sec : evolover ] )   which occurs as a consequence of hydrogen exhaustion in the core ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "recent age determinations for the oldest , most metal - poor galactic globular clusters ( such as m92  =  ngc  6341 ) include those by @xcite ( 13.5  gyr ) , who also revise downward ( by incorporating diffusion in their models ) the age obtained , using high - quality strmgren photometry and a distance - independent method , by @xcite , which was clearly much higher than the age of the universe favored by wmap ; and those by @xcite ( in the 12 - 14  gyr range ) .",
    "while these ages appear broadly consistent with the favored wmap age , it should be noted that the recently suggested revision in the abundances of elements in the sun , based on 3d models of the solar convective region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , will lead , according to @xcite , to an _ upward _ change ( by @xmath5  gyr ) in the cluster ages , which may complicate the agreement between wmap and globular cluster results , especially ( e.g. , @xcite ) when the formation and chemical evolution time before the oldest globular clusters were born is properly accounted for .",
    "the latter time interval , according to @xcite , is likely to be in the @xmath6  gyr range . on the other hand , another recent study ( @xcite )",
    "concludes instead that the new abundances will indeed lead to an increase in cluster ages ( by a maximum of @xmath7 ) , but only for _ open _ clusters , globular cluster ages remaining instead essentially unchanged with respect to previous models .",
    "* low - mass stars can be used as a probe of the properties of fundamental particles that are already present within the so - called standard model of particle physics , as well as on the existence and nature of ( non - standard ) dark matter particle candidates ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , the cooling of low - mass rgb stars would be affected by a non - zero neutrino magnetic moment , thereby impacting such important observables as the magnitude of the rgb tip , the absolute magnitude of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the pulsation periods of rr lyrae stars , and the relative proportion of stars on the rgb , hb , and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . by comparing theoretical models",
    "in which a neutrino magnetic moment is included with the observations , one obtains a very stringent bound on this quantity ( @xcite ) , which in fact is several orders of magnitude more stringent than is possible to achieve at present from laboratory experiments ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . using similar arguments , stringent limits",
    "can also be placed on the electric charge of the neutrino ( @xcite ) , the mass and other interaction properties of the axion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and even the size of large extra dimensions ( @xcite )  though in the latter case more stringent constraints can be obtained from wd s ( @xcite ) and ( especially ) neutron stars ( @xcite ) . * finally , it is also worth recalling that our own existence crucially depends on the properties of a low - mass star ( the sun ) , whose past and future evolution are accordingly crucial in determining our origin and destiny in the universe . for instance , the earth may or may not , depending on the amount of mass lost in the form of stellar winds ( which unfortunately we are unable to predict from first principles at present ) during its evolution as a red giant , be completely engulfed by the sun during the latter s evolution as an agb star , when its age is around @xmath8  gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that , while it is clear that the solar radius will expand enormously during its evolution as a red giant , the actual orbital radii of the planets will move out as a consequence of mass loss from the sun , the ultimate fate of the earth and the other inner planets depending on how much mass exactly is lost during the sun s evolution as a red giant . in fact , the earth s oceans will likely evaporate and its atmosphere be lost to space even before the sun reaches the turnoff point , when its luminosity becomes 10% of more higher than its present value ( see @xcite for reviews and additional references ) .",
    "while the theory of stellar structure and evolution is one of the oldest and most successful of all astrophysical theories , it is still subject to a number of approximations and limitations which often make their predictive power less optimum than is commonly realized . in the following sections ,",
    "an overview is provided of the main ingredients that enter stellar structure / evolution calculations for low - mass stars , highlighting some of the current limitations and problems encountered when comparing models and observations .    as an editorial remark ,",
    "the reader who may be interested in an overview of the evolution of low - mass stars before digging into a mathematical discussion of the principles of stellar structure and evolution is encouraged to proceed directly to  [ sec : evolover ] , later returning to  [ sec:4bas ] in order to better appreciate the techniques that are used to arrive at some of the results discussed in  [ sec : evolover ] .",
    "the modern phase of stellar structure / evolution studies was born with the advent of nuclear astrophysics , when the role of thermonuclear reactions in stellar interiors became clear ( @xcite ) .",
    "the roughly 70 years since this major development have been mostly devoted to refining the physical ingredients that enter the same basic set of four differential equations already known at that time , namely :    @xmath9    where    @xmath10    here , @xmath11 is the distance from the star center , and @xmath12 is the mass contained within this distance .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the thermodynamic variables pressure , density , and temperature , respectively , while @xmath16 is the luminosity ( in units of energy per unit time ) at the position corresponding to @xmath12 ( or @xmath11 ) .",
    "( when @xmath11 is used as the independent variable , one is talking about the _",
    "eulerian formalism _ , whereas @xmath12 is used as independent variable   as above   in the so - called _",
    "lagrangean formalism_. ) finally , @xmath17 corresponds to the energy generation rate ( in the form of thermonuclear reactions ) , @xmath18 to the energy loss rate ( in the form of neutrinos ) , and @xmath19 to the work that is performed on the gas ( per unit time per unit mass ) during any expansion / contraction of the star ( for an ideal gas , it can easily be shown that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the specific entropy ) .",
    "@xmath22 , as usual , is the newtonian constant of gravitation .",
    "note that partial derivatives have been used throughout to emphasize that the physical solutions that satisfy these equations are not stationary , but rather evolve with time , as a consequence of the nuclear transmutations in the stellar interior and the ensuing changes in chemical composition and mean molecular weight @xmath23 brought about by the thermonuclear reactions .",
    "each one of these basic equations is extensively discussed in any stellar structure / evolution textbook ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so that we will not go through their derivation in detail .",
    "these equations are , in the order they appear , the _ mass conservation equation _ , the _ hydrostatic equilibrium equation _ , the _ energy conservation equation _ , and the _ energy transport equation_. while the first two are of chief importance in determining the mass profile inside the star ( and are in fact the only ones used in the theory of self - gravitating , `` polytropic '' gas spheres ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the latter two are of paramount importance in defining the _ thermal profile _ of the star .",
    "naturally , the latter can only be accomplished with a theory of energy transport inside the star , which must somehow appear in relation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bas4 ] ) .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "what the reader should realize at this point is that , even though we have a system of four equations , we actually have five unknown quantities that appear explicitly in them , namely : @xmath11 , @xmath14 , @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to solve the system , we need one additional equation .",
    "this is given by the _ equation of state _",
    "( eos ) , which provides one of the thermodynamic quantities in terms of the others ; for instance , @xmath24 .",
    "the reader is referred to the appendix in @xcite for a discussion of and references to the different eos implementations commonly adopted in low - mass stellar interiors work . ]    as such , the eos is often called one of the _ constitutive equations _ of stellar structure / evolution , describing as it does a physical property of the matter in the stellar interior .",
    "the perceptive reader will have noticed that additional constitutive equations are still needed in order to solve the problem , since several additional quantities ( such as the @xmath17 s ) also enter these equations . within this framework ,",
    "the complete set of constitutive equations can be written as follows :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath27 is the monochromatic opacity , and @xmath28 is the thermonuclear reaction rate for reactions that transform nuclei of type @xmath29 into nuclei of type @xmath30 ( the corresponding energy generation rate @xmath31 being given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents the mass excess , or the amount of energy released when transforming a nucleus of type @xmath29 into a nucleus of type @xmath30 ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the energy loss rate due to emission of neutrinos ( typically taken from @xcite or from @xcite , or from earlier work by the japanese group ) .",
    "the mean molecular weight @xmath23 is given by the following expression :    @xmath34\\frac{x_i}{a_i } ,    \\label{eq : mu}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 indicates the chemical abundance by mass fraction of the @xmath36-th chemical element present in the stellar interior ( whose atomic mass and number are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ) , and @xmath39 is the number of free electrons contributed by one average particle of type @xmath36 . under suitable use of the boltzmann and saha equations ( including ,",
    "as may be indispensable in the stellar interior , the appropriate coulomb corrections ) , one is able to compute @xmath39 , and hence @xmath23 , at every point in the interior of a star , as needed for integration of the above system of equations .",
    "the importance of the saha equation is that it allows one to compute the fractions of each element under different ionization stages as a function of the local temperature and density .",
    "time evolution in the abundance of element @xmath36 is then given by the following equation :    @xmath40    subject to the constraint @xmath41 .",
    "note that it is common practice , in stellar interiors work , to characterize the chemical composition of a star using only three numbers , namely @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44   which represent the mass fraction of hydrogen , helium , and all elements heavier than helium ( or `` metals , '' in astronomical jargon ) , respectively . in this case , the proportions of the different `` metals '' are usually taken to be the solar ones . in the case of the elements formed by successive captures of @xmath0 particles ( helium nuclei ) , namely o ,",
    "ne , mg , si , s , ca , and ti , which for spheroids are found to present non - solar abundance ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has been shown that a simple rescaling of @xmath44 that takes into account the @xmath0-element overabundance , according to @xmath45   where @xmath46 is the solar - scaled metallicity , @xmath44 is the metallicity after account is taken of the @xmath0-element overabundance , and @xmath47 is the @xmath0-element overabundance factor   is sufficient for the computation of models that look morphologically very similar in the @xmath48 diagram ( hereafter hertzsprung - russell diagram , or simply hrd ) , at least for metallicities @xmath49 ( @xcite ; but see also  [ sec : compobs ] below for caveats regarding the extension of this result to the empirical color - magnitude diagram , hereafter cmd for short ) .    the preceding discussion shows how eqs .",
    "( [ eq : con1 ] ) , ( [ eq : con4 ] ) , and ( [ eq : con5 ] ) can be used to build a stellar structure model and evolve it in time .",
    "how do the other constitutive equations enter the picture ? in order to answer this question , we must first take a look at how energy is transported in stellar interiors .      in stars , under normal circumstances",
    ", there is a steady flow of energy from the innermost regions , where thermonuclear reactions take place , to the outermost regions  and , eventually , from the latter to the interstellar space .",
    "depending on the thermodynamical properties of the matter , such energy transport can occur in three different ways : by _ radiative transfer _ , which describes the transport of energy from hotter to cooler regions by photons as they interact with matter ; by _ convective motions _",
    ", which are macroscopic ( usually turbulent ) fluid motions which set in , under non - degenerate conditions , when radiative transport is incapable of taking care of the energy transport by itself ; and by _ conductive transfer _",
    ", which becomes very efficient under degenerate conditions but is usually quite negligible otherwise .      under conditions of _ radiative equilibrium _",
    ", when essentially all the energy is transported outwards by photons , it can be shown that the temperature gradient in eq .  ( [ eq : bas5 ] ) takes the form    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the radiation constant , @xmath52 is the speed of light in a vacuum , and @xmath53 is the so - called _ rosseland mean opacity_. the latter is computed , on the basis of monochromatic opacities , from the following expression :    @xmath54    here @xmath55 is the frequency , and @xmath56 is the monochromatic planck function .",
    "tabulations of rosseland mean opacities from the opal ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) and op ] ( @xcite and reference therein ) groups are available in the literature and on the groups respective web sites , and are almost exclusively employed in state - of - the - art stellar structure and evolution models , except for very low temperatures where molecular effects not treated in sufficient detail by op and opal become important . in the latter case , of particular importance when dealing with stellar envelopes and atmospheres , the opacities by alexander & ferguson ( @xcite ) are generally used .",
    "we will come back to the subject of radiative opacities momentarily .",
    "let us first take a look at the radiation transport equation at a given point in the stellar interior . consider a point in the star at a distance @xmath11 from the center .",
    "then the amount of energy that flows through a cylinder of length @xmath57 inclined by an angle @xmath58 with respect to the radial vector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] ) is given by the balance among four different terms : first , the radiation that enters the base of the cylinder , given by @xmath59 ; second , the radiation that is lost from the top of cylinder , given by @xmath60 ; third , the radiation gains due to emission inside the cylinder , given by @xmath61 , where @xmath29 is the emission coefficient and is the emissivity ( assumed isotropic ) ; fourth , the radiation losses due to absorption inside the cylinder , given by @xmath62 , where @xmath0 is the absorption coefficient and @xmath63 is the opacity . from this",
    ", it follows that the _ energy _ that is lost per unit time from inside the cylinder due to absorption is @xmath64 ( where @xmath21 is the area of the base , and @xmath65 the associated solid angle ) , whereas the amount of energy gained per unit time due to the emissivity is @xmath66 . naturally , the difference between these two terms must equal @xmath67 d\\omega \\ , ds$ ] .",
    "therefore , one has :    @xmath68    which can also be written as    @xmath69    we must get rid of either @xmath70 or @xmath11 in order to put this equation into a useful form   and , of course , we choose to keep the latter . noting the geometrical relations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] )    @xmath71    one easily arrives at the following differential equation :    @xmath72    since the only radiation field - related quantity that enters the set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bas1])-([eq : bas4 ] ) is the luminosity , which in turn is related to the radiation flux by the geometric relation @xmath73 , we can transform the above equation into a more useful form that uses directly the flux .",
    "we achieve this goal by recalling the definition of flux , namely ,    @xmath74    we must accordingly replace the intensity with the flux in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) , which we achieve by multiplying the latter by @xmath75 and integrating over all solid angles .",
    "we get :    @xmath76    it is easy to show that , in fact ,    @xmath77    recalling the definition of energy density @xmath78 as the zero - th order moment of the radiation field over the speed of light @xmath52 , we then have :    @xmath79    while we have succeeded in getting rid of the intensity and bringing the flux into our formalism , we have unfortunately introduced another quantity which we ( still ) do not know how to compute from the thermodynamic properties of the medium , namely , the energy density @xmath80 .",
    "we thus need at least one additional relationship involving the energy density in order to be able to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : difff2 ] ) .",
    "we can obtain one such relation by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) by @xmath81 and again integrating over all solid angles . in this way , and recalling that the radiation pressure @xmath82 is the second moment of the radiation field ( over @xmath52 ) , we get :    @xmath83    again , we have achieved our goal of eliminating @xmath80 from the differential equation  but only at the expense of adding in yet another unknown quantity , namely the radiation pressure",
    ". we could muliply yet again eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) by @xmath84 and integrate over all solid angles , but this will again add in a higher - order moment of the radiation field  and so on and so forth .",
    "a particularly elegant way out of this conundrum is to analyze the convergence of a cosine series expansion of the radiation field at a given point in the stellar interior :    @xmath85    in a typical stellar interior , this series converges extremely rapidly ( see  75 in @xcite , or @xmath86ii.6 in @xcite ) , with a typical convergence rate given by    @xmath87    which allows us to ignore the higher - order terms in this expansion with very high accuracy .",
    "therefore , we take , with sufficient accuracy ,    @xmath88    in this case , the energy density , the flux , and the radiation pressure assume the following values :    @xmath89    from this , it is immediately clear that @xmath90 .",
    "it is also apparent that the energy density depends only on the isotropic component of the radiation field ( higher - order contributions to eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mom1 ] ] typically being many orders of magnitude smaller than the zero - order term , and hence totally negligible ) .",
    "conversely , the radiation flux depends only on the degree of anisotropy of the radiation field .",
    "small as the latter may be in stellar interiors , it is absolutely crucial in terms of the structure of the star and its very existence as a visible object !    what are the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 ?",
    "since @xmath80 is the energy density of the radiation field , and since conditions of thermal equilibrium hold to excellent approximation in stellar interiors , it is natural to identify @xmath91 with the thermal ( planck ) contribution , which is given by    @xmath93    therefore ,    @xmath94    which implies , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffpr ] ) ,    @xmath95    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : t42 ] ) , then ,    @xmath96    or , in terms of the luminosity ,    @xmath97    recalling the definition of logarithmic temperature gradient ( eq .  [ eq : bas5 ] ) , and bearing in mind the chain rule of calculus , one has    @xmath98    but we actually know the value of the pressure gradient from our hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium ( eq .",
    "[ eq : bas2 ] ) , which in the eulerian form reads @xmath99 ; therefore ,    @xmath100    which , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lumt ] ) , gives    @xmath101    which is the desired expression for the temperature gradient in the stellar interior when the energy is transported outwards by radiation .",

    "we can make further progress by noting that , provided the speed of sound is sufficiently high compared with the displacement velocity of the bubble , the latter is always capable of keeping pressure equilibrium with its surroundings .",

    "since the bubble s velocity at the formal convective border , and hence its ultimate fate , clearly depends on what happened to it _ before _",

    "theoretical investigations show that the core - helium burning phase of low - mass stars may be characterized initially by convective core overshooting , and later by the formation of a _ semiconvective zone _ surrounding the convective core .",
    "what happens in this phase is that the opacity of the matter in the convective core becomes higher and higher as he is transformed into c , as a consequence of the increasing contribution of the free - free process with increasing carbon abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "since a chemical composition discontinuity is progressively built up between the c - enriched core and the he - rich envelope , a discontinuity in @xmath190 also results .",

    "the end result is the development of a _ partially mixed _ , convectively neutral ( i.e. , with @xmath201 ) , `` semiconvective '' region outside the `` canonical '' convective core .",
    "exceedingly clear descriptions of the entire process have been provided in @xcite .",
    "the semiconvective phenomenon has been known for almost 50 years , having first been identified by schwarzschild & hrm in their study of the evolution of high - mass stars ( @xcite ) . in it , they described the occurrence of a zone   the semiconvective zone   just outside the convective core `` in which the convection is so slow that it does not contribute to the energy transport but is fast enough to modify the composition , so that convective neutrality is maintained in every layer of this zone . '' naturally , since they were dealing with the convective cores of high - mass ms stars , in their work they only tackled the phenomenon of _ hydrogen _ semiconvection . in low - mass stars , on the other hand , semiconvection takes place in the core he - burning phase , and may accordingly be termed helium semiconvection . interestingly , in the former case semiconvection arises because the opacity of the hydrogen - rich matter just outside the convective core is higher than just inside the convective core , whereas the opposite is true for the convective overshooting that leads to semiconvection in hb stars . for yet another example of the occurrence of semiconvection in low - mass stars , the reader is referred to the studies of @xcite on the role played by semiconvection on the agb phase .    by bringing he - rich material into the core",
    ", a semiconvective zone enables a low - mass star to burn helium that is present over a much wider range in mass than would otherwise have been possible , thereby leading to a significant increase in the hb lifetime and also dramatically impacting the morphology of hb evolutionary tracks in the hrd ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from the point of view of a fluid dynamics theoretician , on the other hand ,",
    "`` the still unsolved problem ''   in the words of canuto ( @xcite )   `` is as follows : what are the values of @xmath102 and @xmath202 in such a zone ? '' in addition , canonical theory simply assumes that the composition distribution within the semiconvective zone instantaneously adjusts to insure convective neutrality , without any attempt to follow the time evolution of the convective layer .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a recent , detailed discussion of this problem , and to @xcite for 2d hydrodynamical calculations and comparison of the results with commonly adopted prescriptions for the treatment of semiconvection in stellar interiors ( see also @xcite ) .    an important problem related to the semiconvection mechanism operating in hb stars are the so - called `` breathing pulses , '' which lead to abrupt _ enhancements _ in the core helium abundance as a consequence of sudden outward movements of the edge of the convective core when he is approaching exhaustion in the core ( i.e. , when @xmath203 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main question here is whether these `` breathing pulses '' are real or instead an artifact of the canonical assumptions used to treat convection and mixing in stellar interiors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since these pulses significantly increase the amount of he fuel that is burnt on the hb phase , they accordingly decrease the amount of he that is available for burning on the agb phase ; therefore , they may crucially affect the predicted number ratios between agb and hb stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while inclusion of semiconvection is indeed crucial for correctly predicting the observed agb - to - hb number ratio ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", comparisons between models that allow for the breathing pulses and the observations strongly suggest that these pulses do not occur in real stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if time - dependent overshooting is adopted as opposed to canonical semiconvection , breathing pulses arise naturally and the corresponding models are still consistent with the observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the hb computations by @xcite , in which time - dependent overshooting was considered , the overall results ( hb lifetime , evolutionary track morphology ) were found to be in excellent agreement with those using canonical semiconvection but suppressing breathing pulses , with one important difference : the breathing pulses , by perturbing the interior structure as they redistribute carbon from the central he - burning regions , cause fluctuations in the stellar radius , and thus in the predicted rr lyrae pulsation periods , which may be related with the   often erratic   period changes observed in rr lyrae stars ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite , and  9 in @xcite for a review of the available observations ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have argued that convective breathing pulses , and in fact even semiconvection itself , are an artifact of the use of a local theory of convection , disappearing when a non - local formalism is properly adopted .",
    "however , the model of convection upon which the reasoning by @xcite is based has been strongly questioned ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for recent discussions on this hotly debated topic .    to close , we note that semiconvection at the base of the convective _ envelope _ has recently been found in evolved solar models ( at an evolutionary age of 6.5  gyr ) by @xcite , as a consequence of diffusion increasing the abundances of heavier elements ( hence the opacity ) below the base of the convective zone .",
    "( see  6.2.3 in the monograph by @xcite for a review of overshooting at the base of the solar convective envelope . ) to the best of the present author s knowledge , a similar phenomenon has not yet been described / included in other studies of low - mass stellar evolution .      besides radiation and convection , energy can also be transported from one place in the star to another by the movement of individual particles ( i.e. , electrons , protons , neutrons , @xmath0-particles , etc . ) . in practice ,",
    "given their low masses ( hence high velocities ) and the high degree of ionization in stellar interiors , only electrons play a truly significant role in this regard .    still , under normal conditions , it can be shown that energy transport by conduction is much smaller than by either radiation or / and convection , so that it is safe to neglect its contribution when computing stellar structure models .",
    "this rule of thumb , however , breaks down under one circumstance which is of crucial importance in the life of a low - mass star , namely , the development of _ electron degeneracy_. when matter becomes degenerate   which is what happens in the cores of rgb and agb stars and in white dwarfs   the low - lying energy states all become filled , which effectively prevents electrons from undergoing frequent collisions with other ions or electrons ( since if they did collide their energies might change , which can not frequently happen since only high - lying energy states have not yet been filled ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean free path of an electron increases dramatically , and a typical electron may be able to travel a large distance before finally colliding and releasing its excess energy . a strongly degenerate gas is often approximated by a zero - temperature fermi gas ; however , this is not a sufficiently good approximation in the case of low - mass rgb and agb stars , in which degeneracy is not so strong .",
    "note that , in the evolutionary phases preceding the rgb , the gas in the deep stellar interior can be approximated as a fully ionized perfect gas .",
    "conductive opacity @xmath204 is defined in such a way that the energy flux by electron conduction takes on a form similar to that which applies to radiative transport ( eq .  [ eq : fluxt ] ) , namely ,    @xmath205    where @xmath206 is the conductive energy flux .",
    "therefore , in a region where conduction is important , the total energy flux is given by    @xmath207    where the `` equivalent opacity '' @xmath208 is given by    @xmath209    as can be seen , the radiative and conductive opacities add as do the resistances of two resistors associated in parallel in a simple electric circuit ; this means that energy flow proceeds primarily through the `` easier '' of the two channels ( i.e. , the one with the lower opacity ) , just like electricity will flow primarily through the resistor with the lower resistance .",
    "note that this rule is not valid for the computation of either the radiative or conductive opacities individually ; indeed , the former is the result of the summation over many different physical processes , such as bound - bound ( or line ) transitions , bound - free transitions ( photoionization ) , free - free transitions ( inverse bremsstrahlung ) , molecular transitions , thomson scattering , etc .",

    "over the past several decades , the most frequently adopted recipes for conductive opacities in stellar interior calculations have been those by hubbard & lampe ( @xcite ) and by itoh and co - workers ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , and as noted by @xcite , these recipes are not strictly valid in the interiors of low - mass rgb stars , where matter is in an intermediate form between a gas and a liquid ( coulomb coupling parameter @xmath210 ) .",

    "some of these differences appear to be due to the different prescriptions for the eos used in the different projects ( @xcite ) .",

    "in particular , @xcite have developed the so - called _ full spectrum of turbulence _ model which , unlike the mixing length theory , takes into account the existence of turbulent eddies of all sizes . in this theory ,",
    "the concept of mixing length is also redefined ; in particular , the authors advocate the use of @xmath213 in the computation of stellar models , where @xmath214 is the distance to the top of the convection zone as determined by the schwarzschild criterion ( eq .  [ eq : schwarz ] ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented an extension of the original full spectrum of turbulence model , in which the processes that generate the turbulence were more carefully considered .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that there are so very many particles available in a typical stellar interior that even if a minor fraction of them  ",
    "i.e. , those located towards the high - energy tail of the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution , or ( more precisely ) around the so - called `` gamow peak ''   are able to actually take part in nuclear reactions , still the required amount of energy to support the star can be generated in the process .",

    "of course , when carrying out such extrapolations , there is always the danger that previously unknown nuclear resonances may fall in the `` uncharted territory '' frequently represented by astrophysical energies   but this is a risk that must be assumed in stellar structure / evolution work . on the other hand , and as already pointed out , this is also one of the reasons why astrophysics may be used as an empirical probe of nuclear reactions , even beyond the domain within reach in a physicist s laboratory .",
    "probably the main source of uncertainty in the calculation of the structure and evolution of low - mass stars , as far as nuclear reactions rates are concerned , is the @xmath218 reaction   which , as already stated , becomes of increasing importance towards the end of the hb phase . at present , the cross section for this reaction , for typical he - burning temperatures , is 5 - 6 orders of magnitude below the experimental sensitivity ( @xcite ) .",

    "this phenomenon is accounted for using the so - called _ plasma screening factors _ ( see , e.g. ,  6.8 in @xcite for a simple treatment ) . in modern stellar structure work ,",

    "some readers may ask , `` why not compute the model atmosphere _ along _ with the interior structure ? ''",
    "while this would be ideal in principle , there is a practical limitation that makes this increasingly prohibitive as the surface is approached .",

    "the differential equations are independently integrated from the inside of the star out , on the one hand , and from the outside in , on the other   and the solutions are required to match at some intermediate point in the stellar interior .",
    "one problem with this method is that these integrations become extremely sensitive to the starting values once stars evolve off the ms ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a consequence , in modern work ,",
    "the henyey method is by far the most frequently used method .",
    "whereas the aforementioned works by @xcite should be consulted for more details , the overall flavor of the henyey method can be described as follows .",
    "first , one divides the star into discrete mesh points , then replaces the basic differential equations  ( [ eq : bas1])-([eq : bas4 ] ) with difference equations .",
    "given an approximate solution for these difference equations , which can come either from a good guess or more commonly from the previous model in the evolutionary sequence , one then linearizes the difference equations to first order in the corrections and solves the resulting set of linear equations for the corrections , which are then added to the approximate solution to obtain an improved solution .",
    "this process is then repeated until the corrections become sufficiently small , i.e. , the model converges . in its essence , the henyey method is basically a glorified version of the newton - raphson method for solving equations given an approximate solution .",
    "implementations of the henyey method are provided in the cd that accompanies the @xcite monograph .    in stellar evolution work ,",
    "one is obviously interested in determining the _ time evolution _ of the models thus computed .",
    "naturally , one must specify a sufficiently small but finite time step to adopt in the numerical computations .",
    "such a time step can be obtained by requiring that the change in the abundance of the elements ( eq .  [ eq : chemevol ] ) , from one model in the sequence to the next , be sufficiently small . however , some evolutionary phases of low - mass stars , such as the rgb and agb , present some particular difficulties that prevent such a simple procedure to be applied in practice . in particular , during these phases",
    "one often encounters exceedingly narrow h - burning shells , with masses of order @xmath262 .",
    "consider one such h - burning shell , whose mass coordinate , in the case of an rgb star , is evolving outward in time .",
    "clearly , even a small outward movement of this shell produces a large change in the hydrogen abundance , since the hydrogen content above the shell is still high , while that underneath it is essentially zero . in terms of",
    "the simple method just described , then , the time step required to follow the time evolution of this rgb star becomes very small , thus requiring an enormous number of models , and therefore large amounts of computer time , in order to reliably follow the evolution of the star during its ascent up the rgb ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , a special technique has been specifically devised and is commonly adopted to treat the time evolution of this evolutionary phase .",
    "this is the so - called _ shell - shifting _ technique , which is described in detail in @xcite .    in like vein , the helium `` flash '' phase which follows the end of the rgb phase but precedes",
    "the hb is commonly not followed in detail in the course of hydrostatic evolutionary computations ( but see @xcite for impressive exceptions to this rule ) .",
    "instead , one commonly applies methods designed to `` transport '' or `` scale '' an initial model ( taken from the rgb tip ) to the zero - age hb phase .",
    "different techniques to accomplish this have recently been reviewed by @xcite , to which the reader is referred for a comparison of the differences that may result between these approximate techniques and actual evolutionary computations carried out through the he flash .      once a theoretical stellar model has been successfully computed , the main output of the code that is of interest to observers ( for a star of a given mass and chemical composition ) consists in the total luminosity @xmath16 and effective temperature @xmath251 .",
    "photometric observations , on the other hand , do not yield directly either of these quantities ; instead , one is presented with magnitudes ( which are converted into _ absolute _ magnitudes once the interstellar extinction and distance are known ) and _ color indices_. to compare theoretical predictions with the observations , one again needs to resort to model atmospheres , from which are computed _ bolometric corrections _ and _ color - temperature relations_. while it is common practice to use such relationships derived with a solar - scaled mix of the elements , it is well known that stars pertaining to different stellar populations may present very different proportions of different types of elements , such as ( and especially ) the @xmath0-capture elements ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has recently been shown ( @xcite ) that model atmospheres computed with the appropriate element abundances may yield appreciably different bolometric corrections and color transformations than scaled - solar ones , with a potentially significant impact on the comparison between model predictions and the observations .",
    "the set of equations in  [ sec:4bas ] is strictly valid only in the so - called `` standard '' or `` canonical '' scenario , which remains by far the most frequently adopted scenario in the modern stellar astrophysics literature .",
    "more specifically , in the canonical framework one ignores any deviations from spherical symmetry , rotation , element diffusion , magnetic fields , and the possible presence of close companions , and each and any of the possible associated instabilities",
    ". active work on each of these specific areas continues to be carried out , but so far a complete evolutionary sequence for a star consistently taking into account all of these neglected effects has not been produced   and , we suspect , is unlikely to be produced in the near future , either .",

    "this is one of the most important problems in stellar structure and evolution at present , and its solution may impact several different areas of astrophysics , considering that the `` solar metallicity '' is a fundamental point of reference in many different astrophysical contexts .",
    "0.5 cm    _ rotation : _ the impact of rotation is one of the major question marks in the study of the evolution of low - mass stars",
    ". observations of evolved low - mass stars , particularly on the hb phase , reveal a rich phenomenology which is very difficult to explain on the basis of simple models ( see @xcite for a recent review and references ) . an illuminating description of some of the fundamental problems encountered in treating angular momentum transport and evolution in rotating low - mass stars is provided in @xcite , whereas @xcite contains examples of several circumstances under which rotation can play a role in interpreting the observed properties of evolved stars in low - mass stellar systems .",
    "0.5 cm    _ extra mixing and pollution : _ as is well known , rotation may also induce extra mixing beyond what is predicted in the canonical framework , which may be crucial in explaining the observed abundance patterns for the light elements in low - mass red giants ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such extra mixing may not always be due to rotation : tidal effects due to the presence of close companions may also play an important role in at least some cases ( @xcite ) .    in regard to abundance inhomogeneities in globular cluster stars",
    ", it is becoming increasingly clear that a fraction of the stars in at least some globular clusters forms from gas that has somehow become contaminated by helium - enriched material in the cluster s early history , leading to distinct signatures in the observed cmd s ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it remains far from clear how the large pollution levels that are inferred from these cmd s can come about , though several different scenarios have been recently advanced for the origin of these ( presumably ) second - generation stars ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . as an alternative to this second - generation / pollution scenario",
    ", it has also been suggested that protocluster clouds may , as a consequence of diffusion , show important helium abundance variations from one place to the next @xcite .",
    "one way or another , the confirmation of significant abundance inhomogeneities in at least some globular clusters has weakened somewhat the traditional view that globular star clusters are the closest approximation to a physicist s laboratory in astronomy ( @xcite ) , a view which is generally held due to the great uniformity in their stars ages , distances , and ( as had been previously thought ) chemical composition",
    ".    0.5 cm        _ mass loss : _ one of the most fundamental , yet least studied , non - canonical ingredients in the evolution of low - mass stars is mass loss .",
    "it has long been known that low - mass rgb stars must lose substantial amounts of mass before helium ignition in their cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but no fundamental theory exists that allows one to compute such mass loss from first principles . while mass loss does not affect the evolutionary path of an rgb star in the cmd in a substantial way unless mass loss is so substantial that the star may either directly become a helium wd or ignite helium on its way to the wd cooling curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) , mass loss does have a huge impact on the subsequent evolution , determining the temperature distribution along the hb ( and therefore playing a key role within the framework of the so - called `` second parameter '' phenomenon that affects the hb morphology of galactic globular clusters ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and the ultimate fate of the star .",
    "as to the latter , depending on the total mass loss on the rgb phase , the star can go through an agb manqu , a post - early - agb , or a post - agb phase , before finally evolving to the carbon - oxygen wd cooling curve ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "last but not least , there exist several different semi - empirical mass loss formulae that purport to describe the mass loss rates as a function of a star s physical parameters ( such as radius @xmath264 , surface gravity @xmath146 , and luminosity @xmath16 ) , none of which being clearly superior to the others in terms of describing the available data ; what is worse , the different formulae predict different amounts of mass loss on the rgb , which makes it virtually impossible to predict with any degree of confidence the temperature that the star will have once it reaches the zero - age hb ( @xcite ; see  5 in @xcite for a recent review and references ) .",
    "mass loss may also be a relevant ingredient on the hb phase proper , at least as far as the derivation of surface gravities from the observed hydrogen line profiles is concerned ( @xcite ) .",
    "now that we have built the fundamental equations of stellar structure and evolution , let us see briefly what has been found to happen , in the case of a low - mass star , when these equations are integrated numerically and the solution is allowed to evolve with time .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track ] , we show the complete evolutionary path for one such star .",
    "the part of the track labeled `` cloud collapse '' is in fact not the result of hydrostatic calculations as have been primarily discussed in this paper , but rather represents the results of the hydrodynamical simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "all the other evolutionary phases , in turn , were kindly computed by a. v. sweigart ( 2007 , _ priv .",
    "_ ) , using his 1d hydrostatic code .",
    "note that a small , arbitrary shift ( in both temperature and luminosity ) has been applied to the @xcite track , in order to ensure a match with the sweigart zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "we now provide a brief summary of the main aspects of the indicated evolution .",
    "more detailed discussions can be found in @xcite and @xcite ( cloud collapse phase ) , @xcite and @xcite ( hydrostatic contraction to the zams ) , in several papers by icko iben , jr . and collaborators ( evolution on the ms and beyond ; @xcite ) , and also in several monographs ( e.g. , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "empirical tests of low - mass stellar evolution using the cmd s of globular clusters are described in great detail in the review paper by @xcite .",
    "we follow key phases of the evolution of the ( proto-)star according to the numbers that are indicated along specified sections of the evolutionary track in figs .  [",
    "fig : globa - track ] and [ fig : globa - track - zoom ] :    1 .",
    "we begin by considering a molecular cloud that becomes unstable according to the jeans ( @xcite ) criterion , and which accordingly collapses and fragments in the process ( see @xcite for a review ) . under normal conditions ,",
    "some of these fragments   most , as a matter of fact   will eventually give rise to low - mass stars .",
    "at this early phase ( i.e. , prior to ) , however , the temperature of the fragment is still very low , of order 10  k , and it can not rise much because the cloud is still optically thin . accordingly , this phase   not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : globa - track ]   is known as the _ isothermal phase _ of the cloud collapse .",
    "eventually the opacity will increase and the cloud will become optically thick , thus departing from isothermality . when this happens , the proto - star has reached point in fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track ] , and the classical `` adiabatic phase '' commences .",
    "according to the calculations provided in @xcite , it takes the proto - star of order @xmath265  yr to reach this point .",
    "2 .   around this point a hydrostatic core forms for the first time , and the main accretion phase starts .",
    "as can be seen , the luminosity and temperature increase steadily , and the irregularities that are seen in the evolutionary track reflect random fluctuations in the mass accretion rate .",
    "when accretion tapers off and the final mass is approached , the photosphere of the proto - star finally becomes visible , the structure becomes fully convective , and its luminosity decreases at almost constant temperature , leading to the vertical segment of evolutionary track   the so - called _ hayashi track _",
    "( representing the canonical pre - ms phase )   shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track ] . along",
    "most of this vertical segment , the proto - star is fully convective , and the core gets sufficiently hot that deuterium is burnt efficiently .",
    "a radiative core only forms at the bottom of the curve , due to the fact that the increasing core temperature also leads to increased ionization and hence to a decrease in the opacity , which as we have seen tends to quench convection ( recall eqs .  [",
    "eq : schwarz ] and [ eq : delrad ] ) . after this point ,",
    "the proto - star becomes hotter and increases again in brightness while it is still shrinking in size .",
    "the increasing core temperatures also lead to incomplete cno processing along the first steps of the cn - branch of the cno cycle , with @xmath1c in particular being progressively consumed in the core .",
    "( for even lower - mass stars , the core temperature never becomes high enough for @xmath1c to be processed , and the pre - ms evolution remains vertical all the way to the zams . ) until @xmath1c is finally exhausted in the core and the ppi chain finally begins to operate in equilibrium , with the star settling on the zams , an additional @xmath266  yr will have passed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the zams proper .",
    "when the star finally settles here , it stops contracting and now evolves along the much longer _ nuclear timescale _ , which is of order @xmath267  yr for low - mass stars .",
    "accordingly , the star changes position along this region of the hrd only very slowly , with its temperature and luminosity slightly increasing with time as hydrogen is steadily transformed into helium by means of the pp chain ( the cno cycle is currently responsible for a mere 1.5% of the sun s current luminosity ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the ms phase is so slow that the sun s radius had already attained about 87% of its current value , its effective temperature was around 97% of the current temperature , and its luminosity some 68% of the current luminosity when the sun first reached the zams ( @xcite ) , which happened some @xmath268  yr ago ( @xcite ) . a very nice pie chart illustrating the run of several physical quantities with radius for a low - mass zams star",
    "is provided in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called _ turn - off point _ , which is related to ( though not necessarily identical with ) the exhaustion of hydrogen in the center of the star .",
    "from this point onwards , hydrogen burning ceases to be a central process , becoming instead a _ shell - burning _ process .",
    "initially , hydrogen burns in a thick shell , whereas the helium - rich core , which is now becoming isothermal , keeps growing in size as a consequence of the helium that is being produced at its outer border . the core can not grow indefinitely , however : there is a limit to the mass that can exist in an isothermal core and still support the overlying layers , given by the so - called _ schnberg - chandrasekhar mass _ ( @xcite ) , or around 10% of the total mass of the star . when its mass increases beyond this point , the core must collapse on a thermal timescale , thus heating up and releasing energy in the process .",
    "the rise in core temperatures also leads to a rise in temperature at the base of the thickening h - burning shell , and accordingly h - burning by the cno cycle becomes increasingly important ( having in fact become dominant in the center even before the to point was reached ) . as a consequence of the fact that the cno cycle has a very high temperature dependence ,",
    "the h - burning shell becomes thinner and thinner .",
    "however , not all the energy released by the h - burning shell actually reaches the surface : part of it is used to expand the star s envelope .",
    "as a consequence of this expansion , the star begins to cool down , and the characteristic evolution to the right constitutes the so - called _ subgiant phase_. ( in higher - mass stars , this phase proceeds much faster , and gives rise to the so - called _ hertzsprung gap _ in the color - magnitude diagram . )",
    "the corresponding cooling of the outer layers leads to the formation of a convective envelope , and the star eventually reaches the base of the rgb .",
    "the further contraction of the core , moreover , leads to the establishment of electron degeneracy there .",
    "therefore , when the star reaches the base of the rgb , its structure is characterized by a growing but inert , partially degenerate he - core , surrounded by a h - burning shell that is becoming progressively thinner , and an outer convective envelope that is becoming progressively thicker .",
    "6 .   at this point",
    ", the convective envelope reaches its maximum inward penetration , thus leading to the dredge up of material that has been partially processed nuclearly , including a small amount of he .",
    "this is the so - called _ first dredge - up _ phase ( @xcite ) . from this point in time",
    "onwards , the convective envelope begins to retreat .",
    "it takes the star an additional @xmath269  yr to go from the turn - off point to this evolutionary stage , whereas the remainder of the rgb phase lasts of order @xmath270  yr , becoming progressively quicker as higher and higher luminosities are attained .",
    "the h - burning shell continues to advance outward in mass , thus leading to a continued increase in mass of the he core . at the indicated point",
    ", the h - burning shell actually encounters the chemical composition discontinuity that was left behind as a consequence of the maximum inward penetration of the convective envelope .",
    "since the envelope is naturally h - rich , this means that the h - burning shell is suddenly presented with an extra supply of fuel .",
    "the structure of the star , presented with this extra fuel supply , readjusts momentarily to this new situation , with an actual ( small ) reversal in its direction of evolution before it resumes its ascent of the rgb .",
    "the details of this process depend crucially on the precise abundance profile in the h - burning shell ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the observed cmd s and rgb luminosity functions of globular star clusters , and as first predicted by @xcite , one in fact identifies the so - called _ rgb `` bump '' _ as an observed counterpart of this stellar interior phenomenon ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the rgb bump also appears to correspond to the position in the cmd that marks the onset of mixing of nuclearly - processed elements beyond that predicted by the canonical theory ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the final stages of the star s ascent of the rgb are again characterized by the increasing size of the he - core , which keeps on contracting and heating up .",
    "very instructive pie charts showing schematically the structure of the envelope and core of such an rgb star have been provided , respectively , in figs .  8 and 9 of @xcite . at this stage",
    "large amounts of energy are lost in the form of neutrinos , such emission being most efficient where the matter is denser   which leads to an actual temperature _ inversion _ in the core ( @xcite ) , its hottest regions moving as far away from the center as @xmath271 by the time the rgb tip is reached . as a consequence , when temperatures finally become high enough for the helium - burning reactions to commence , this happens not in the actual center of the star , but in fact in a _",
    "shell _ inside the he - rich core . in this sense , the fact that the matter in the core is degenerate leads to a dramatic phenomenon which had not been previously encountered in the life of the star   the so - called helium _",
    "`` flash''_. + 0.5 cm to understand the physics behind the flash phenomenon ( see @xcite ) , consider first what happens in the case of thermonuclear burning under _ non_-degenerate conditions . in this case",
    ", the energy input to the medium by the nuclear reactions tends to increase the local temperature , but this temperature increase also tends to increase the local pressure , which in turn tends to expand the region where the reaction is taking place and hence cool down the material , thereby preventing a further increase in the nuclear reaction rate . in other words , thermonuclear burning , under non - degenerate conditions , is a self - regulating process , which allows nuclear burning to proceed quiescently over long periods of time . in the case of degenerate matter , on the other hand , this is not possible : since in this case the eos lacks a temperature dependence , the local temperature increase does _ not _ lead to an increase in the local pressure , and therefore the region where burning has started can not expand and cool down . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy input by the nuclear reactions leads to an increase in the local temperature , which leads to a further increase in the thermonuclear reaction rates , which leads to another increase in the local temperature , and so on and so forth   giving rise to a so - called _ thermonuclear runaway _",
    "( hence the term `` he flash '' ) , which can only cease once degeneracy is lifted .",
    "as a matter of fact , most of the energy that is produced during the he flash ( which can exceed , according to @xcite , @xmath272 ; in fact ,  the models shown in figs .  [ fig : globa - track ] and [ fig : globa - track - zoom ] reach a peak he - burning luminosity of @xmath273 , which should be compared with the luminosity emitted by the entire galaxy , @xmath274 ) is used to lift up the degeneracy in the core , so that the luminosity of the star does not increase during this so - called `` pre - hb phase ''   rather the opposite , in fact ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track - zoom ] ) .",
    "in addition , since ( as already stated ) the initial flash occurs off - center , additional flash events take place increasingly closer to the center of the star , until degeneracy has been lifted throughout the he core ( @xcite ) .",
    "when this happens and the star is finally able to burn helium quiescently in a convective core and hydrogen in a shell , the star has reached the so - called zero - age hb ( zahb ) . from the rgb tip to the zahb , @xmath275  yr will have passed , and around 5% of the core s helium fuel will have been consumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , only a very small number of stars is expected to be found in the pre - hb evolutionary phase , which is the reason why no such star has ever been positively identified . very recently",
    ", it has been suggested that , as a consequence of the fact that many pre - hb stars are expected to cross the instability strip before they arrive on the zahb , some stars which might be going through this phase could be identified as variable stars with peculiarly fast period change rates ( @xcite ) , since their periods should depend , according to the period - mean density relation of pulsation theory , on their luminosities and radii , which are both changing on a very short timescale compared with other variables ( such as the rr lyrae and type ii cepheids ) which occupy a similar region of the hrd .",
    "this is the zahb that was alluded to in the previous paragraph , marking the onset of the he - burning phase proper   which , in the case of low - mass stars , is referred to as the _ horizontal branch _ ( hb ) phase , due to the fact that hb stars all have very nearly the same luminosity irrespective of mass , thus leading to the characteristic horizontal feature that is seen in the cmd s of globular clusters .",
    "hb stars play a particularly important role in determining the distances and ages of old stellar populations , and also in the interpretation of the formation and evolution history of the galaxy and its neighboring satellites ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "pie charts illustrating the run of several physical quantities with radius for a zahb star located close to the blue edge of the instability strip are provided in figs .",
    "10 and 11 of @xcite .",
    "+ 0.5 cm unfortunately , the exact zahb temperature of a star can not be predicted a priori , depending as it does on how much mass the star may have lost on its ascent of the rgb ( see the end of  [ sec : noncan ] for a discussion of some of the problems encountered in treating mass loss in red giant stars ) . in general , the stars that lose the least amount of mass will fall on the red portion of the zahb , whereas those that lose a substantial fraction of their masses will actually fall on the blue zahb , some possibly becoming `` extreme '' hb ( ehb ) or blue subdwarf ( sdb ) stars . in turn ,",
    "intermediate amounts of mass loss should lead to rr lyrae variable stars , since the classical instability strip actually crosses the hb at intermediate temperatures , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track - zoom ] . of course",
    ", not only stars whose zahb positions fall within the instability strip will become rr lyrae variables : in fact , as a consequence of evolution away from the zahb , stars which arrived on the blue zahb are expected to become rr lyrae stars later in their lives , when they are already well on their way to become agb stars ( which is precisely what happens with the particular star whose evolutionary path is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : globa - track - zoom ] ) .",
    "conversely , some stars whose zahb position falls on the red hb may also , depending ( among other things ) on the relative efficiency of their h - burning shells compared with their he - burning cores , develop blueward loops that may take them through the instability strip at some point in the course of their lifetimes .",
    "when the star reaches this point , which happens @xmath276  yr after its arrival on the zahb , he has been exhausted in its center , and the star begins its life as a low - mass agb star . a glimpse at fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track - zoom ] will promptly reveal that the term `` asymptotic '' comes from the fact that , for low - mass stars , the evolution proceeds ever closer to the first - ascent rgb , but never quite reaching it . in terms of its internal structure , an agb star is defined as a star with an inert core ( comprised mostly of carbon and oxygen ) which burns he in a shell and h in another shell further out , such shells becoming progressively thinner as the star climbs up the agb . a very instructive diagram comparing the run with radius of several different physical quantities for an hb and an agb star",
    "is provided in fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    "+ 0.5 cm in agb stars , the he- and h - burning shells take turns as the most efficient energy sources , as a consequence of the thermal instabilities that were first encountered in the computations by @xcite . in spite of being reminiscent of the he flashes that were found under degenerate conditions at the rgb tip and on the pre - hb phase",
    ", electron degeneracy does not play an important role in the case of these so - called `` agb thermal pulses , '' the cause here being instead a highly temperature - dependent nuclear energy source operating in a very thin shell ( @xcite ) .",
    "stars that have not yet reached this thermally pulsing phase are termed `` early agb '' or e - agb stars ( @xcite ) , whereas the thermally pulsing ones , which are preferentially found towards the brighter portions of the agb , are called , not surprisingly , tp - agb stars .",
    "+ 0.5 cm in e - agb stars , the h - burning shell has very little efficiency , since the onset of he burning in a shell has caused the h - burning shell to expand and cool .",
    "the onset of he - shell burning causes a temporary reversal in the star s evolutionary direction ( as can be seen immediately after point in the evolutionary track shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track - zoom ] ) , which leads to the so - called _ agb clump _ in the observed cmd s of well - populated globular clusters and old local group galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the h - burning shell is inefficient , the mass of the he - rich region outside the c - o core can not increase much in mass during this phase .",
    "eventually , the outward - moving he - burning shell reaches the associated he / h chemical composition discontinuity . when this happens , the he - burning shell dies down , and accordingly the overlying h - burning shell contracts rapidly and is re - ignited .",
    "the corresponding he ashes are then compressed and heated , and finally ignite once they reach a critical value ( of order @xmath262 for a @xmath277 c - o core ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this marks the onset of the tp - agb phase .",
    "+ 0.5 cm unlike what happened in the case of the earlier he flash at the tip of the rgb , matter in this case is _ not _ degenerate , so that the energy that is liberated in a pulse does lead to an increase in the local pressure , and therefore to an expansion .",
    "this expansion cools down the region where he burning is taking place , thus lowering its rate and leading to a phase of quiescent he burning .",
    "the h - burning shell , during this expansion phase , is pushed outward to such low temperatures that h burning again dies down . during this",
    "quiescent he - burning phase , the he - burning shell consumes all the he that was created by the previous phase of h burning in a shell , until a he / h discontinuity region is again reached . as before ,",
    "he burning is then again quenched , h burning resumes , and the same processes that had previously given rise to a thermal pulse are again triggered .",
    "+ 0.5 cm besides nucleosynthetic signatures in the form of @xmath220-process elements ( see  [ sec : unc ] ) , these thermal pulses can give rise to characteristic `` loops '' in the cmd , such as the ones that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : globa - track - zoom ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . during some of these loops ,",
    "the star may again cross the instability strip , becoming a type ii cepheid ( @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the agb evolutionary phase , which lasts of order @xmath278  yr , are extremely complex , depending strongly on the ( poorly known ) mass loss rates , and the reader is referred to the quoted papers , and also to the recent monograph by @xcite and reviews by @xcite , for more detailed descriptions of the physics and phenomenology surrounding agb stars .",
    "+ 0.5 cm once the agb star s envelope mass has become very low , a final , quite dramatic mass ejection episode may take place , the so - called `` superwind phase '' ( @xcite ) , whose origin and nature still remain the subject of much debate .",
    "one way or another , the ejection of the outer layers of the agb stars is expected to lead to the formation of a so - called `` post - agb star '' ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : globa - track - zoom ] ) , which is basically the bare core of the progenitor agb star finally exposed .",
    "( surrounding such a post - agb star a planetary nebula may also be found , in which the ejected gas is being `` lit up '' by the central star . ) following a very quick evolution to the blue accross the hrd , the star finally settles on the wd cooling sequence ( fig .",

    "the latter , in fact , represents the `` death bed '' of a low - mass star , provided , of course , it does not somehow acquire mass from / merge with a companion   but that would be quite a different story .",
    "+ 0.5 cm before closing , we note that a low - mass star may reach the wd cooling curve following other evolutionary routes , including the following : ( i )  directly after the rgb , bypassing the hb and agb phases , which may happen if somehow mass loss on the rgb is so extreme that the he core never gets to grow to the minimum level required for he ignition . in this case , a he wd is formed , not a c - o one .",

    "( iii )  directly from the ( early ) agb phase , i.e. , prior to the thermal pulsing phase .",
