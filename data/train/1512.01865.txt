    "the total polarized intensity images reveal a bright central ring with relatively sharp outer edge near @xmath10.3@xmath17 ( @xmath27 au ) , a deficit of scattered light just outside this radius , and a fainter scattering halo extending to at least @xmath11@xmath17 ( @xmath28 au ) .",

    "the radial profiles obtained from the unscaled @xmath13 and @xmath14 polarized intensity images ( lefthand panels of fig .",

    "the profiles furthermore indicate that the outer scattered light halo drops smoothly out to @xmath1100 au , a displacement roughly corresponding to the corner of the field of view of gpi at @xmath13 band .",
    "the radial profiles of the scaled polarized intensity at @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( righthand panels of fig .",
    "2 ) more clearly show the sharp dip feature ( hereafter referred to as a gap ) to be centered at @xmath30 au ; its fwhm of @xmath15 au indicates that the gap is well resolved by gpi .    the radial profiles in fig .",
    "2 also indicate that the polarized intensity is relatively isotropic , with large - scale asymmetries only of order @xmath110% and no clear systematic differences in surface brightness along directions parallel vs.  perpendicular to the disk position angle .",
    "this is consistent with the modest disk inclination determined from radio line data ( @xmath31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) . in the @xmath14 image , the inner disk surface brightness appears somewhat brighter to the southeast .",
    "given that the same asymmetry is not present in the @xmath13 image , however ( compare left panels of figs .  1 and 2 ) , the apparent inner - disk asymmetry at @xmath14 is most likely caused by poor centering of the star+disk under the coronagraph .    in figure 3 , we present surface brightness profiles obtained by averaging the @xmath13 and @xmath14 polarized intensity images over concentric elliptical annuli with minor : major axis ratios of 0.99 ( approximating a circular disk with inclination of 7@xmath16 ) at single - pixel ( 0.014@xmath17 ) intervals , with the ellipses oriented at a position angle of @xmath32 .",
    "these profiles , which are discussed in detail in  4 , decline rapidly from @xmath33 au to the gap feature at @xmath3425 au , appear nearly flat out to @xmath140 au , and then drop precipitously beyond this radius .",
    "there is also an inflection in surface brightness at @xmath3590 au that is more apparent in the ( higher s / n ratio ) @xmath13 band radial profile .    the profiles in figs .  2",
    ", 3 furthermore suggest that the bright inner disk has a ring - like structure ; i.e. , the surface brightness of polarized intensity peaks at @xmath3615 au , with a potential decline interior to this radius .",
    "we note , however , that the peak in polarized intensity appears to lie closer to the star at @xmath13 than at @xmath14 ( peaks near @xmath110 au and @xmath112 au , respectively ) .",
    "this suggests that the decrease in polarized intensity near the inner working angle of the coronagraph may be instrumental in origin , although there remains the possibility that there is in fact a deficit of small dust grains in the tw hya disk within @xmath110 au of the star .",
    "if real , this inner cavity dimension would be somewhat larger than previously deduced from sed fitting ( which yielded an inner cavity size scale of @xmath134 au ; * ? ?",

    "previous near - infrared coronagraphic imaging of tw hya disk was conducted with hiciao , in polarimetric mode , on the 8 m subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "this imaging revealed a potential gap at a radial position of @xmath34 au in the scattered - light surface brightness distribution of the tw hya disk .",
    "this feature is readily apparent in the radial polarized intensity profiles extracted from our gpi coronagraphic / polarimetric imaging ( figs .  2 , 3 ) . the gpi radial profiles furthermore provide refined measurements of the position and width of the inner gap detected by subaru / hiciao , as well as the dependence of scattered light on radius from @xmath110 au to @xmath180 au . specifically , we find the scaled polarized intensity ( fig",

    "the gpi data also appear to confirm the presence of a gap near @xmath3590 au that was inferred from hst imaging @xcite , in the form of a weak inflection in the gpi @xmath13 band surface brightness profiles .",
    "we caution , however , that this radius roughly corresponds to the limit of the gpi field of view at @xmath13 .    in characterizing the potential gap at @xmath120 au",
    ", @xcite parameterized the azimuthally averaged polarized intensity of the tw hya disk in terms of a `` stair - like '' decline in radial power law ( @xmath38 ) , with a drop from @xmath110 to @xmath120 au characterized by @xmath39 , a flattening to @xmath40 between @xmath120 au and @xmath140 au , and then a turnover to @xmath41 out to @xmath180 au .",
    "adopting the same `` three - zone '' model ( fig .  3 , top panel ) ,",
    "we find similar values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , in the two zones within @xmath140 au , but we measure a considerably steeper decline of @xmath44 beyond @xmath140 au .",
    "however , the clear appearance of the gap - like feature at @xmath123 au in fig .",
    "2 suggests it is preferable to parameterize the azimuthally averaged polarized intensity profiles ( fig .",
    "3 ) in terms of a smooth decline in the inner disk ( from @xmath110 au to @xmath145 au ) that is interrupted by the gap feature at @xmath123 au , and a turnover to a steeper decline beyond @xmath145 au ( i.e. , a `` two - zone '' model ) . adopting this parameterization",
    ", we find the radial dependence of polarized intensity is characterized by @xmath45 between @xmath110 au and @xmath145 au and by @xmath44 between @xmath145 au and @xmath180 au ( fig .  3 , top ) .",
    "the latter value is rather extreme compared with the value @xmath46 that is predicted for radial scattered - light profiles by simulations that adopt `` conventional '' surface density and scale height profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see next section ) .      in the right panel of fig .  3",
    ", we compare the radial near - ir polarized intensity profiles of tw hya with those obtained from gpi imaging of v4046 sgr @xcite , a close binary , classical t tauri system that , like tw hya , is relatively nearby and evolved ( @xmath47 pc ; age @xmath120 myr ) .",
    "the tw hya disk and the v4046 sgr ( circumbinary ) disk are also similarly massive and chemically rich ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the comparison demonstrates that the two disks display similar slopes of azimuthally averaged polarized intensity in the @xmath11230 au range ; both show gaps , in the form of depressions in polarized intensity , near @xmath120 au ; and both show turnovers to much steeper radial polarized intensity profiles in their outer disks . for tw hya ,",
    "the turnover to a steeper slope occurs at @xmath145 au , as noted above , whereas for v4046 sgr the turnover lies near @xmath128 au and the slope of the outer disk profile is steeper ( @xmath48 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gap feature near @xmath120 au is evidently also much wider and deeper in the tw hya disk than in the v4046 sgr disk .    in our tests of monte",
    "carlo scattering models , we found that the radial polarized intensity gradient is relatively insensitive to the radial gradients in disk surface density and scale height , within reasonable ranges for these parameters ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "there would hence appear to be two potential explanations for the turnovers in the radial polarized intensity profiles of both disks : shadowing of the outer disk by the inner disk , or a sharp change in the radial gradient of the specific surface density or scale height of small and/or highly - ir - reflective dust grains .",
    "with regard to these alternatives , it is intriguing that the radial positions of the turnovers of the polarized intensity profiles in the tw hya and v4046 sgr disks at @xmath145 au and @xmath128 au , respectively , appear to closely coincide with the inner edge of a ring of c@xmath10h emission ( tw hya ; * ? ? ? * ) and the inner edge of a ring of submm - wave continuum emission ( v4046 sgr ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the case of tw hya ,",
    "the ring of c@xmath10h may mark a region of enhanced stellar - irradiation - driven desorption of volatiles from grain surfaces , and/or photodestruction of dust grains themselves , in disk surface layers @xcite . in the case of v4046 sgr ,",
    "the ring of submm emission is likely due to a zone of dust grain growth and grain size segregation processes that are potentially related to planet building @xcite .",
    "the apparent spatial correlations between the turnovers in radial polarized intensity profiles ( fig .  3 ) and these zones of c@xmath10h and large grain production may or may not be significant , but are deserving of further study , alongside further explorations of the radial intensity profiles generated by monte carlo disk scattering models (  4.3 ) .",
    "both the depth ( @xmath10.5 dex ) and width ( @xmath15 au ) of the apparent gap at @xmath30 au in the tw hya disk , as imaged by gpi , appear generally consistent with the predictions of simulations of disk gap clearing by giant planets @xcite . in figs .",
    "4 and 5 , we directly compare the gpi polarized intensity images and radial profiles , respectively , with model images and profiles of a protoplanetary disk with an embedded planet of mass 0.16 @xmath2 ( @xmath49 @xmath50 ) at an orbital semimajor axis of 21 au .",
    "the star / disk / planet model and resulting simulated near - ir images have been generated via the same methodology and monte carlo radiative transfer code as is described in detail in @xcite . to investigate the effect of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio on the comparisons of model and data , we generated low - noise and high - noise model images consisting of runs with @xmath51 and @xmath52 photons , respectively .",
    "the latter runs yield images more closely resembling the s / n ratios of the gpi images near the gap region of the disk .",
    "the images were then convolved with an approximate instrumental psf .",
    "the similarity of the ring - gap structure in the model and data is evident from fig .",
    "4 . in the low - noise model images ,",
    "a spiral feature resulting from planet - induced resonances in the disk is also apparent both within and outside the darker gap near 20 au . in the high - noise model images ,",
    "only the in - gap portion of the spiral is detectable , as the surface brightness enhancement of the outer spiral is modest ( @xmath15% ) compared with that of the in - gap spiral ( @xmath130% ) .",
    "such a spiral structure is not apparent in the gpi images , although given the s / n ratio of the gpi images within and around the gap ( s / n @xmath1 10 ) , the outer spiral would not be detectable ( middle panels of fig .  4 ) .",
    "such a direct comparison is further complicated by a modest asymmetry in surface brightness at radii @xmath5325 au in the gpi images that is due to imperfect centering of the star behind the coronagraph (  2 ) .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare the observed and model radial profiles , where the latter have been renormalized in intensity so as to match the gpi data .",
    "we find the model intensity renormalizations necessary to match the data in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands are the same to within @xmath120% , indicating that the @xcite model well reproduces the wavelength dependence of scattered light .",
    "it is evident from fig .  5 that the width , depth , and overall shape of the gap feature in the model disk with embedded 0.16 @xmath2 planet provide a good match match to the gpi data , over the range @xmath115 au to @xmath125 au .",
    "it is also evident that the model slope is steeper than the data for radii @xmath5315 au and @xmath5425 au . under the assumptions that the radial profile of the dust surface density ( @xmath55 ) and the scale height of the dust in the vertical direction ( @xmath56 ) both obey simple power laws and that the dust population is uniform ( i.e. , the dust scattering properties do not vary ) throughout the disk , we have experimented with disk models having various radial dependences of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we found that changing @xmath55 and @xmath57 from their original @xcite radial dependencies of @xmath58 and @xmath59 to @xmath60 or @xmath61 , respectively , results in a change of a factor of a few in absolute disk brightness in the near - ir .",
    "however , these power law parameter changes have relatively little impact on the radial dependence of scattered light ; specifically , the radial scattered light power law index @xmath62 changes by at most @xmath10.3 .",
    "this is because scattered light emerges from the disk surface with an intensity that is largely determined by the ( grazing ) incidence angle of starlight on the surface @xcite ; changes to the simple radial power - law dependences of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , while changing the disk flaring angle somewhat , do not yield significant changes to the radial dependence of this grazing incidence angle .",
    "the foregoing suggests that future work aimed at exploring the discrepancy between the observed and model radial profiles should focus on invoking more complex disk radial and vertical dust density dependences ( e.g. , broken power laws ) , potential radial and vertical gradients in the grain scattering properties , and/or disk shadowing effects .",
    "the first two possibilities are well motivated by observations at other wavelengths (  4.2 ) as well as by the likelihood that grain growth within disks can produce complicated radial dependencies of @xmath55 for specific dust grain sizes , superimposed on simple power - law @xmath55 forms for the disk as a whole @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "present models suggest that an outer disk that is completely shadowed by the inner disk can display a very steep scattered light radial power law index ( see , e.g. , fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented gpi polarized intensity images of tw hya that reveal the surface dust density structure of the disk from @xmath180 au to within @xmath110 au of the star at @xmath11.5 au resolution .",
    "the gpi imaging unambiguously confirms the presence of a gap in the disk at @xmath123 au , with a width of @xmath15 au and a depth of @xmath150% .",
    "the comparison between these gpi data and a monte carlo radiative transfer model of a disk with embedded planet (  4.3 ) appears to provide compelling evidence that a ( proto)planet is likely responsible for clearing this gap in the tw hya disk .",
    "we caution , however , that other mechanisms may be responsible for generating gap and ring structure in protoplanetary disks .",
    "for example , the gap in the tw hya disk that we have resolved with gpi could be a natural consequence of the radial dependence of grain fragmentation rates @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested via alma submm continuum imaging of the tw hya disk at spatial resolution comparable to that of the gpi imaging .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have proposed that disk gaps may form at radii corresponding to ice condensation fronts , which act as catalysts for rapid , localized grain growth .",
    "although such a model may pertain to the tw hya disk , we note that the gap at @xmath63 au seen in gpi and subaru / hiciao imaging lies well outside the ( @xmath15 au ) radius where water ice is expected to form on dust grains , and well inside the ( @xmath130 au ) inner edge of a ring of n@xmath10h@xmath11 submm line emission that is hypothesized to mark the radius where the disk midplane drops to the ( @xmath120 k ) temperature at which co freezes out @xcite .    followup coronagraphic imaging with gpi and with sphere ( on the vlt )",
    "is hence now warranted , to test the hypothesis that at least one gas giant planet with a mass of @xmath10.2 @xmath64 is actively forming in the tw hya disk at an orbital semi - major axis similar to that of uranus .",
