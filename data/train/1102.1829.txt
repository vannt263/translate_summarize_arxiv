    "the focus of this article is on the partial difference equation @xmath3 known as the _ discrete schwarzian kdv equation _ ( dskdv ) , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are independent variables , @xmath6 denotes the value of the dependent variable @xmath7 at the lattice site @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary functions in the indicated variables . as a lattice equation , dskdv ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] )",
    "was first studied in @xcite , and classified as a special case of ` q1 ' equation in the abs list @xcite .",
    "it yields the schwarzian kdv equation @xmath11 in the continuous limit , and is related to the lattice modified kdv equation and the lattice kdv equation by miura transformations @xcite .",
    "note that the differential operator @xmath12 in ( [ eqn : skdv ] ) is the _",
    "schwarzian derivative _ and thus ( [ eqn : skdv ] ) is invariant with respect to mbius transformations .",
    "the soliton equations with mbius invariance may consequently be called ` schwarzian ' . see @xcite for a review of schwarzian equations .",
    "we sometimes refer to ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] ) as _ non - autonomous _ for non - constant @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both constants , we call it _",
    "autonomous_. dskdv is also known as the _ cross - ratio equation _ , since the left hand side of ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] ) is the cross ratio , which is fundamental to many branches of geometry and was studied as early as the time of euclid .",
    "our main motive for exploring this system comes from a geometrical setting : dskdv arises as one of the most basic equations in the discrete differential geometry , which is expected to provide a new mathematical framework of discretization of various geometrical objects .",
    "for example , dskdv is used to define the discrete conformality of discrete isothermic nets @xcite .    for notational simplicity",
    ", we display only the shifted independent variables .",
    "for example , @xmath13 may be written as @xmath14 . using this convention , ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] )",
    "may be written as @xmath15    note that if there exists a function @xmath16 satisfying @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are arbitrary functions , then ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] ) is automatically satisfied with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in this article",
    ", we aim to clarify the structure of the bilinear difference equations and @xmath0 functions associated with dskdv ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] ) .",
    "we then construct various solutions to dskdv , including the soliton type solutions of autonomous dskdv presented in @xcite . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider the _ discrete schwarzian kp equation _ ( dskp ) .",
    "we first discuss the bilinear equations and @xmath0 function of dskp in section [ subsec : dskp ] .",
    "we then establish the reduction procedure to derive dskdv from dskp . in @xcite a basic geometric property of circles",
    "was shown to be equivalent to dskp , and dskdv as a special case . in that article a reduction from dskp to a degenerate dskdv was discussed .",
    "the full , non - autonomous dskdv is difficult to achieve via reduction because of complications arising from the non - autonomous terms .",
    "however , a method to circumvent these complications was described in @xcite , where the reduction is performed along auxiliary variables , enabling the reduced equation to remain non - autonomous in its independent variables .",
    "we use a similar technique to obtain dskdv from dskp by reduction .",
    "we thereby construct solutions to ( [ eqn : cross_ratio ] ) in the form of @xmath0 functions of the casorati ( @xmath22-soliton ) and molecule types .",
    "this is explained in section [ sec : dskp_red ] .",
    "dskdv appears not only as one of the discrete soliton equations , but also as the equation describing the chain of bcklund transformations of the painlev systems .",
    "this was first reported in @xcite for the case of the painlev vi equation , which implies that dskdv also admits solutions expressible in terms of the @xmath0 functions of the painlev vi equation .",
    "the same situation also arises for other painlev systems . in section 3",
    ", we discuss dskdv in the setting of the painlev systems and construct explicit formulae of solutions in terms of their @xmath0 functions .",
    "we consider the painlev systems with the affine weyl group symmetry of type @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the former includes a @xmath25-painlev iii equation , and the latter the painlev vi equation .",
    "the discrete schwarzian kp equation ( dskp ) is @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 are the discrete independent variables and @xmath29 is the dependent variable .",
    "dskp was first published in an alternative form in @xcite , first appeared in the quoted form in @xcite and was also studied by @xcite . in the context of discrete differential geometry , @xmath7 arises as a complex valued function .",
    "we first give an explicit formula for the solution of dskp in terms of a @xmath0 function :    [ prop : d2dtl ] let @xmath30 be the @xmath0 function satisfying the following bilinear difference equations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the auxiliary independent variables .",
    "then , @xmath34 satisfies dskp ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) .    first note that if there exist some functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath37 then ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) is automatically satisfied . dividing ( [ bl : d2dtl ] ) by @xmath38 we have @xmath39 which is equivalent to ( [ dskp_ansatz ] ) if we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 by @xmath42 respectively",
    ".    dskp ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) is invariant under the change of the independent variables @xmath43 ( @xmath44 )",
    ". therefore if the @xmath0 function is a solution to the bilinear equation @xmath45 then @xmath7 in ( [ dskp : z ] ) also satisfies ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) . in this case ,",

    "it is therefore possible to construct the casorati determinant solution to these equations ( [ bl : d2dtl ] ) as follows @xcite :    [ thm : casorati_tau : dskp ] let @xmath48 be an @xmath49 casorati determinant defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are arbitrary functions satisfying the following linear relations : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are arbitrary functions in the indicated independent variables and @xmath56 is a constant .",

    "it is possible to obtain dskdv by a certain reduction procedure from dskp ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) . on the level of @xmath7 ,",
    "the reduction is achieved by applying three extra conditions , which are obtained by imposing a certain symmetry in each of the independent variables @xmath27 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the symmetry required is such that one of the independent variables @xmath27 ( @xmath44 ) of dskp ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) can be negated in each of three conditions .",
    "in fact , only two conditions are needed as the third is redundant , we only mention that there are three such conditions for completeness .",
    "let @xmath73 be a function satisfying ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) .",
    "we impose the following equations for @xmath7 : @xmath74 then ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) is reduced to dskdv ( [ eqn : cross_ratio2 ] ) .",

    "we drop the @xmath76 dependence in the expression of @xmath79 and @xmath7 .",
    "then ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) , ( [ red1:dskp])@xmath80 and ( [ red1a : dskp])@xmath81 can be written as @xmath82 respectively .",
    "one can eliminate @xmath79 from ( [ red2:dskp ] ) and ( [ red3:dskp ] ) as follows : we first eliminate @xmath83 and @xmath84 from ( [ red2:dskp])@xmath85 by using ( [ red3:dskp])@xmath86 and ( [ red3:dskp])@xmath87 . in the resulting equation ,",

    "the resulting expression still contains @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , but they are eliminated by virtue of ( [ red3:dskp ] ) , leaving the following expression in @xmath7 alone @xmath93 equation ( [ red4:dskp ] ) is rearranged in the following form @xmath94 from which we obtain ( [ eqn : cross_ratio2 ] ) .",
    "note that the ansatz ( [ dskp_ansatz ] ) is reduced to ( [ eqn : red_bilinear ] ) ( or ( [ cross_ratio_ansatz2 ] ) below ) as follows . substituting ( [ dskp_ansatz ] ) into the reduction condition ( [ red1:dskp ] )",
    ", we have @xmath95 which is solved by @xmath96 , causing the ansatz ( [ dskp_ansatz ] ) to become @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are arbitrary functions .",
    "now we apply the additional condition on @xmath7 , ( [ red2a : dskp ] ) , into which we substitute ( [ eqn : int_ansatz ] ) .",
    "this produces a condition on @xmath98 @xmath100 which implies that @xmath101 must be separable as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are arbitrary . now introducing @xmath105 , ( [ eqn : int_ansatz ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath106 which is equivalent to ( [ eqn : red_bilinear ] ) .",
    "let us consider the reduction on the level of the @xmath0 function and construct explicit solutions to dskdv .",
    "the above discussion and ( [ dskp : uv ] ) suggests that the reduction condition to be imposed should be @xmath107 , where @xmath108 means the equivalence up to gauge transformation .",
    "however , due to the difference of gauge invariance of the dskp and dskdv ( and their bilinear equations ) , the reduction can not be applied in a straightforward manner .",
    "we apply the reduction to the solutions in theorem [ thm : casorati_tau : dskp ] and [ thm : dskp_molecule ] separately .",

    ", we have the following theorem :    let @xmath121 be an @xmath49 determinant given by @xmath122 @xmath123 where @xmath124 are constants , @xmath54 ( @xmath5 ) are arbitrary functions in the indicated variables and the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 are related as in ( [ reduction : parameters ] ) .",
    "then @xmath58 satisfies the bilinear equations ( [ bl2:sigma ] ) , and @xmath115 defined by ( [ z : cross_ratio1 ] ) satisfies dskdv ( [ eqn : cross_ratio2 ] ) with @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we note that the soliton solutions to the autonomous case have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can construct the molecule type solution by applying the reduction to the solution in theorem [ thm : dskp_molecule ] .",
    "let @xmath127 be an @xmath61 determinant given by @xmath128 @xmath129 where @xmath124 are constants , @xmath130 is an arbitrary function in @xmath131 and the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 are related as in ( [ reduction : parameters ] ) .",
    "then @xmath132 satisfies the bilinear equations @xmath133 where @xmath134 moreover , @xmath135 satisfies dskdv ( [ eqn : cross_ratio2 ] ) with @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the reduction process to dskdv is somewhat delicate . for the case of dskp ,",
    "the coefficients of the bilinear equations can be removed by multiplying a certain gauge factor to the @xmath0 function . for example , the bilinear equations ( [ bl : sigma ] ) yield ( [ bl : d2dtl ] ) by using ( [ sig : d2dtl ] ) .",
    "for dskdv , however , such a gauge transformation does not work .",
    "for example , the bilinear equations ( [ bl2:sigma ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath138 by introducing @xmath139 by @xmath140 then we have @xmath141 where @xmath142",
    "the crucial difference from the case of dskp is that the coefficient of the right hand side of ( [ bl3:cross_ratio ] ) can not be removed by multiplying a gauge factor to @xmath0 . even for the autonomous case , namely the case where @xmath54 are constants , it is possible to remove the coefficient of one of the two bilinear equations , but not possible to remove those of two equations simultaneously .",
    "therefore , it is not appropriate to impose the condition @xmath107 on the bilinear equations ( [ bl : d2dtl ] ) .",
    "actually it is obvious that the bilinear equations ( [ bl3:cross_ratio ] ) can not be obtained from naive reduction from ( [ bl : d2dtl ] ) .",
    "we have to apply the reduction to the casorati determinant without its gauge factor instead of applying directly to @xmath30 itself .",
    "such inconsistencies involving gauge factors arising through the reduction process can be seen for other non - autonomous discrete integrable systems as well @xcite .",
    "konopelchenko and schief discussed in @xcite the reduction from dskp to the dskdv by imposing the condition @xmath143 on ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) . using this condition to eliminate the @xmath76 dependence , ( [ eqn : dskp ] ) can be rearranged in the form @xmath144 which yields the special case of ( [ eqn : cross_ratio2 ] ) @xmath145 where @xmath146 is an arbitrary function .",
    "the condition ( [ z12 ] ) is the subcase of the condition ( [ red1:dskp ] ) : it is easily verified that if @xmath7 satisfies ( [ z12 ] ) then ( [ red1:dskp ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "for the solution of dskp given in theorem [ thm : casorati_tau : dskp ] , it can be shown that ( [ z12 ] ) is realized by taking @xmath147 ( @xmath67 ) , imposing ( [ reduction : parameters ] ) , and choosing @xmath56 as @xmath148 .",
    "in this section , we consider the solutions of dskdv which are expressed by @xmath0 functions of certain painlev systems .",
    "we give two examples , one with the symmetry of the affine weyl group of type @xmath23 , the other with that of type @xmath24 , and construct explicit formulae of solutions in terms of their @xmath0 functions .",
    "we note that these solutions are not directly related to ones discussed in the previous section .",
