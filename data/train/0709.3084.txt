    "novel experiments on observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) gives new opportunities to investigate of collective coherent phenomena in quantum and atomic optics and solid state physics - see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "an important tool for that can be taken with the help of the josephson junction problem approach that has a long history relating to cooper - pair tunneling in the superconductor josephson junction ( sjj ) systems - see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "various aspects of josephson phenomenon and superfluid behavior for two weakly linked atomic condensates in double - well potential have been discussed in a number of papers  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however just recently the coherent oscillations and self - trapping regime have been observed experimentally in  @xcite for two condensates of @xmath0 atoms placed in a special optical dipole trap .",
    "the principle item is that photonic `` condensate '' exhibits a similar nonlinear behavior in the problem of optical josephson junction ( ojj ) consisting of two tunnel - coupled optical fibers and/or semiconductor waveguides ( quantum wells )  @xcite .",
    "another type of josephson coupling ( nonlinear josephson effect ) for condensate modes has been considered in  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "nonlinear dynamics like macroscopic self - trapping and intermodal population exchange , has been theoretically analyzed for condensate collective modes ( eigenmodes ) , and namely , for ground state and first excited state modes .",
    "the effective coupling of these modes is guarantied by atom - atom scattering , i.e. by the own nonlinearity of bec placed in highly anisotropic trap .",
    "= 1000 however , the observation of mentioned above phenomena with pure atomic bec medium is strictly limited by extremely low temperature ( about hundred nk ) conditions . at present",
    "the problem of high - temperature quasi - condensation phenomenon that occurs for cavity excitons and polaritons in so - called strong coupling regime evokes a great interest  @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "speaking more precisely the low branch cavity polaritons can be considered as a weakly interacting two - dimensional bose - gas for which the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition occurs at high enough temperatures due to the extremely small mass of polaritons @xmath1 under condition of strong coupling regime for excitons and quantized e.m . field .",
    "although the polariton condensate is the non - equilibrium state and occurs in a specially control situation , the macroscopic occupation of ground state with momentum @xmath2 has been examined experimentally for quantum wells inserted in a semiconductor ( cdte / cdmgte ) microcavity - see  @xcite and more recent results in  @xcite .",

    "it has been demonstrated that statistical properties of the excitons can be converted to match the excitons in coherent states .",
    "the problem is that the bec state in semiconductor systems , fabricated at present , is essentially limited by disorder factor .",
    "recently it was suggested to use a strong disorder in the microcavity to obtain polariton quasi - condensation  @xcite .",
    "however it is not clear until now how it is possible to achieve true condensation for exciton - polariton substance in semiconductor microcavity for this case .    in our paper  @xcite it has been shown that polariton true condensation can be achieved for relatively hot atomic vapor in the case of polariton trapping , when atoms are strongly coupled with optical field in the resonator .",
    "the degeneration of weakly interacting 2d - gas of polaritons can be also associated with the effect of so - called `` spectrum condensation '' observed previously for sodium atoms in the cavity .",
    "for some practical purposes the coherent properties of upper branch of polaritons can be important as well .",
    "in fact , the problem of formation of quantum entangled polariton states from different branches  @xcite is the case in respect to construct the algorithms of quantum cloning and storage for optical field into the cavity polaritons being recently proposed  @xcite . however , in the experiment  @xcite the upper polariton branch has not been developed in the photoluminescence when the quasi - condensation of lower polariton branch takes place under the thermal equilibrium condition .",
    "the existence of large energy gap ( about ten of mev ) between upper and lower branches is also a reason for that .",
    "= 300 but the macroscopic population of the ground ( low branch ) polaritonic state in atomic system can be only one of possible way to obtain interbranch dynamical regimes for such a polariton system",

    "upper polaritonic branch can be populated also by using landau - zener effect when the tunnelling phenomenon between two eigenstates of the system takes place for the time - dependent detuning - e.g.  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to observe such a dynamics is determined by a special scheme of coherent excitation of polaritons from different branches  @xcite .",
    "quantum beats and rabi oscillations in exciton - photon system have been observed in this case  @xcite .",
    "= 300 in present paper we consider the problem of nonlinear dynamics for polaritons of different branches under the mean field approximation .",
    "our approach has some analogy with the problem of macroscopic quantum tunneling and interference that takes place for atomic condensate being associated with ground state and first excited state .",
    "actually , low and upper branches of polaritons represent two types of normal modes in atom - field interaction .",
    "they can be coupled to each other due to atomic nonlinearity .",

    "the regimes discussed here appear for _ localized ( periodically ) phase_. a similar dynamic mqst behavior occurs for nonlinear interaction of two atomic bec modes ( fundamental and first excited ) under the coupled two - mode approximation  cf .",
    "@xcite .    the second kind of the mqst regime associated with so called @xmath173__-phase mqst mode _",
    "_ is presented in fig.1 for relative phase values @xmath190 .",
    "the gray - color regions marked as 2 , 4 in fig.1a and as 2 in fig.1c are responsible for that and characterize the @xmath173-phase pendulum rotations with closed loop trajectories around the value @xmath187  cf .",
    "@xcite . in fig.2",
    "the curves 2,3 demonstrate the mqst dynamics discussed in respect of the regions taken from the fig.1a and fig.1c .",

    "we are emphasis here the two types of the @xmath173-phase modes occurring in the mqst regions in fig.1a , c for the phase values @xmath190 .",
    "two various dynamical trapping regimes ( above and beyond the stationary @xmath68-symmetry breaking value of population imbalance @xmath191 ) have been firstly discussed for macroscopic atomic trapping in the bjj problem  @xcite .",
    "the modified conditions for that can be represented as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath192 for i type of mqst , and @xmath193 for ii type of mqst . at the stationary ( threshold )",
    "point @xmath194 we have @xmath195 , i.e. the average population imbalance coincides with it initial value @xmath118 .",
    "= 500 in contrast with the bjj problem in our case for atomic condensate @xmath173-phase modes one can obtain a new type of _ zero - phase _ mqst modes when the system demonstrates the self - trapping effect according to the conditions ( [ eq25 ] ) , ( [ eq26 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we speak about the mqst states appearing in the regions 3,5 ( fig.1a ) , in regions 3,4 ( fig .",
    "1b ) and in region 3 ( fig.1c ) . for stationary points",
    "@xmath196 in fig.1b we have @xmath197 .    finally , third kind of the mqst dynamical regime occurs for various _ running phase modes _ with unbounded phase @xmath69 .",
    "the case is presented by white - color regions 1 in fig.1 .",
    "the curve 4 in fig.2 characterizes the mqst appearing in the region 1 in fig.1b .",
    "the mqst regimes under consideration can be achieved by different ways depending on the crucial parameters @xmath95 , @xmath149 and also on the values of initial conditions for relative phase @xmath198 and fractional population imbalance @xmath118 .",
    "practically we can vary one of them keeping others unchanged .",
    "for example , let us consider transition from the regime 5 of the rabi oscillations in fig.1b upward , i.e. to the mqst regime 1 with unbounded running phase .",
    "we can establish the condition for such a transition in this particular case in the form : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the initial ( conserved ) energy of the system defined in ( [ eq10 ] ) , the energy @xmath201 characterizes the state that corresponds to two separatrixes going through the points @xmath181 in fig.1b .",
    "for instance , in the case when the parameters @xmath149 , @xmath95 and initial phase @xmath198 are unchanged the bound energy @xmath202 determines a critical value of fractional relative population imbalance @xmath203 .",
    "the mqst dynamics occurs in the case when initial value @xmath204 .",
    "in fig.3a we plot the dependence for time - averaged population imbalance @xmath205 as a function on ratio @xmath206 .",
    "the value @xmath184 in fig.3a characterizes a polariton interaction for the region 5 in fig.1b .",
    "sharp changing of population imbalance at @xmath207 implies the `` phase transition '' to the mqst state with @xmath208 ( region 1 ) . by similar manner",
    "one can obtain a switching effect for dynamical regimes by varying of the @xmath149-parameter .    in fig.3b",
    "we establish a switching phenomenon for the time - averaged population imbalance @xmath205 depending on @xmath95-parameter ( i.e. on kinetic energy of polaritons in transverse plane ) .",
    "the points a , b , c mark the values of @xmath95-parameter for the phase portraits presented in fig.1 . initial value of @xmath209 at @xmath93 characterizes the average fractional population imbalance for polaritons along the cavity length when the supercurrent @xmath210  see eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "the curve ab determines the transition from the mqst regions in fig.1a to the region 5 of the josephson oscillations in fig.1b .",
    "then , with increasing the absolute value of @xmath95-parameter , the regions 5 and 4 are unified in phase plane and form a new drop - like region where the system is self - trapped ( is not shown in fig.1 ) .",
    "such an evolution of the phase portrait in phase - plane is accompanied by sharp transition presented in fig.3b near the value of @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , the drop - like region is collapsed to stationary point @xmath212 in fig.1c with further expanding of the @xmath95-parameter .",
    "the curve bc in fig.3b describes a switching effect from the mqst state with locked phase to the running phase mqst states determined by the region 1 in fig.1c .",
    "the switching dynamics of polaritons depending on the @xmath95-parameter has an important feature in the framework of polariton condensation problem for atomic system .",
    "in particular , for initially non - equilibrium state of polaritons in the cavity with large momentum @xmath25 , the variation of @xmath149-parameter can be used in experiment to achieve a quasi - condensation with @xmath213 for low - branch polaritons . in turn , the last parameter can be easily varied in the experiment by changing the total number @xmath214 of polaritons in the cavity ( we can change , for example , the intensity of laser field interacting with the atoms ) .",
    "thus , observed dynamical regimes for both fractional population imbalance @xmath68 and relative phase @xmath69 allow , first , to estimate the fraction of condensed polaritons in the cavity taking into account the relevant expression ( [ eq14 ] ) for the current @xmath215 and , second , to manipulate with those coherence properties .",
    "= 200 in the paper we developed a quantum theory of josephson dynamics for two macroscopic polariton modes ( belonging to upper and lower energy branches being coupled together due to kerr - like nonlinearity of atomic medium ) .",
    "the phenomenon can be used to examine the macroscopic superfluid properties of condensed polariton state as well .",
    "the analogy with nonrigid pendulum behavior has been carried out to understand the different regimes of polariton interaction .",
    "we found out the dispersion relations and the characteristic frequencies for various regimes of collective excitations in the cavity including the several effects , i.e. the josephson and rabi oscillations , different kinds of the mqst states for fractional relative population imbalance @xmath68 .",
    "some of them can be represented as the new one , and have not been considered yet .",
    "= 400 the realization of macroscopic tunneling and interbranch interaction for polariton modes is important to study in experiment the relative phase coherence in the presence of polariton condensation ( and/or quasi - condensation ) .",
