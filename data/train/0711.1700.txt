    "graphene , a single atomic layer of graphite with a honeycomb crystal structure , has attracted a great number of research activities.@xcite its structural properties , electrical conductance and quantum hall effects have been investigated for making novel nanoelectronic devices.@xcite due to the linear energy dispersion relation near the dirac points , graphene is an interesting conductor in which electrons move like massless dirac - fermions.@xcite it is now possible to make graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) with various experimental methods such as tailoring via a scanning tunneling microscopy tip,@xcite exfoliating from high oriented pyrolytic graphite,@xcite , or graphitizating sic wafers.@xcite the energy gaps of gnrs with several tens of nanometers can be measured because the growth of the energy gap is inversely proportional to the gnrs width.@xcite there are two typical types of gnrs according to their edge configurations , either armchair or zigzag .",
    "zigzag edge gnrs are metallic without considering the freedom of spin because the two edge states are degenerated at the fermi level .",
    "hydrogen - saturated armchair gnrs ( agnrs ) , on the other hand , are semiconductors.@xcite the electronic transport and magnetic properties of zigzag gnrs have also been studied by several research groups.@xcite    because of the high ratio between edge and inner atoms , the electronic structure of narrow gnrs are sensitive to various edge addends .",
    "individual carbon atoms on graphene edges are only bounded to two neighboring carbon atoms and a dangling carbon bond offers a remarkable opportunity for altering gnr s electronic properties .",
    "this edge modification can be implemented by attaching various atoms or functional groups to these dangling carbon atoms . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "edge modified agnrs , except for the hydrogen - passivated gnrs , have not been systematically examined using density functional theory ( dft ) . in this paper , the electronic structures of agnrs , with various addends including h , f , n , no@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 , are thoroughly investigated based on first - principle calculations .",
    "our results show that agnrs can be either semiconducting or metallic by changing edge chemical addends .",
    "this remarkable characteristic is very useful in making graphene - based molecule computing or sensing devices .",
    "the detailed analysis of the electronic structures can also be used to understand the underlying microscopic mechanisms of these edge effects .",
    "the electronic structure calculations are carried out by employing the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package with local density approximation.@xcite the electron - ion interactions are described based on the projected augmented wave ( paw ) and the frozen core approximation.@xcite the energy cutoff is set to be 400 ev . following the previous definition of agnrs,@xcite we choose agnrs with width w=18 , 19 , and 20 ( corresponding to 3p , 3p+1 , and 3p+2 , respectively . here",
    ", p is an integer ) as examples to study three kinds of agnrs .",
    "the schematic of a sample agnr with width of w=18 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "various addends , such as h , f , and n atoms , are connected to individual edge carbon atoms . in the nh@xmath0 and no@xmath0 passivated cases , each edge carbon atom bonds to one nh@xmath0 or no@xmath0 group alternatively",

    "all atomic positions are allowed to relax .",
    "the convergence tolerance in energy and force is 2@xmath110@xmath2 ev and 0.02 ev /  , respectively . the vacuum layers between two neighboring agnr sheets and agnr edges are set to be @xmath3  and @xmath4  wide , respectively . in a typical calculation , a one - dimensional periodic boundary condition along the edge direction is imposed .",
    "we choose the k - point sampling consisting of @xmath4 uniform k - points together with the @xmath5 point .    , and nh@xmath0 molecules ) .",
    "the distance between two dash - dotted lines is the lattice constant of one - dimensional unit - cell in the dft calculations.,width=321 ]",
    "we first choose the well - studied hydrogen passivated agnrs@xcite as a basis to validate our numerical results .",
    "the calculated band structures of three kinds of hydrogen passivated agnrs are plotted in figure 2 ( a ) .",
    "the corresponding bandgaps together with the optimized c - c distances at the edge are listed in table i. our results show that all three kinds of agnrs are semiconductors with direct band gaps at the @xmath5 point .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the agnr with width @xmath6 has the largest energy gap , while the agnr with width w=3p+2 has the smallest one .",
    "our calculated bandgaps are 0.41 , 0.61 , and 0.10 ev for the h passivated agnrs with width w=18 , 19 and 20 , respectively .",
    "these results agree well with the previously reported results @xcite .",

    " m \" stands for the metallic case without e@xmath7 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +        next , we examine the electronic structures of agnrs with f atoms passivated at both edges .",
    "the calculated band structures are plotted in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) and the bandgaps are listed in table i. similar to the h - passivation cases , all f - passivated agnrs are semiconductors . however , the effects of gnr width on bandgaps is clearly different .",
    "for instance , the f - passivation makes the band gap of the agnr with width w=18 ( 3p ) to be the largest ( 0.61 ev ) , while the gap of the agrn with width w=20 ( 3p+2 ) is the smallest ( 0.14 ev ) .",
    "it is important to note that the bandgaps of the agnrs ( width w=20 ) with the smallest gaps remain as the smallest even after passivation .",
    "however , agnrs with the largest bandgaps behave differently and depend on elements used for passivation .",
    "we also would like to know what happens if individual edge carbon atoms connect to two h or f atoms instead of one h or f atom .",
    "intuitively , the sp@xmath8 hybridization of edge carbon atoms is converted into sp@xmath9 hybridization .",
    "the effective agnr width is therefore reduced by 2 . in other words ,",
    "the effective width becomes @xmath10 for both double h- and f - passivated agnrs when their initial width is w=19 .",
    "because the effective width of @xmath10 fits 3p+2 , the corresponding double h- and f - passivated agnrs have the smallest energy gap ( about 0.1 ev ) .",
    "the largest gaps are 0.70 ev for double h - passivated agnrs with w=17 or effective w=16 ( 3p+1 ) . similarly , @xmath11 ev for of double f - passivated agnrs with w=20 or effective w=18 ( a 3p case ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the width dependent energy gap features in single f- or h - passivated agnrs .",
    "it is instructive to compare the dft results with the tight - binding approximation ( tba ) data .",
    "wang et al . have reported that energy gaps can be tuned by changing edge hopping parameters.@xcite son _",
    "et al . _ have also showed that the energy gaps of h - passivated agnrs can be reproduced via tba simulations . in their simulations ,",
    "edge hopping parameters can be increased by decreasing the bond length of c atoms at edges.@xcite although the geometric deformations of carbon networks are almost the same between h - passivated gnrs and f - passivated ones , the bandgaps surprisingly show distinct dependence on the width of agnrs . according to the tba parameters adopted in these analytical calculations of the edge modified grns,@xcite the @xmath12 hopping integrals , representing the coupling between @xmath13 orbital of two neighboring carbon atoms , increases as the c - c distance decreases . however",
    ", this statement is invalid when the bond length substantially decreases so that the hybridization between two carbon atoms becomes perturbed . from the pdos of the h - passivated agnrs , we can see that the peaks of @xmath13 orbital of edge c atoms almost coincide with that of the inner c atoms below the fermi level [ see fig2(c ) ] .",
    "the @xmath12 bonding remains unchanged during the h - passivation of edge c atoms .",
    "the modification of energy gaps caused by h atoms could be explained based on the geometry deformation .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath13 orbital of both edge c atoms and f addends have peaks at @xmath14 ev below the fermi energy .",
    "the peak position of the edge c atoms , however , decreases significantly compared to the inner c atoms from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ev below the fermi energy , which is still within the energy range of @xmath17 bonding in f - passivated agnrs .",
    "that is to say , the @xmath13 orbital of edge c atoms in the f - passivated cases form chemical bonds with the neighboring c atoms and the f atoms . consequently",
    ", the hopping parameters decrease . if we choose the hopping parameter to be 84% of -2.7 ev ( the typical hopping integral of sp@xmath8 carbon system ) , the energy gaps of agnrs with width w=18 , 19 , and 20 are 0.65 , 0.35 , and 0.13 ev , respectively , which agree excellently with results obtained by dft .",
    "this observation demonstrates that the electronic structures of agnrs can be controlled by edge chemical modifications .    - , and nh@xmath0-passivated agnrs with width w = 18 , 19 , and 20 are show in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the edge relaxed geometric structures of no@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 are shown in ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "the relaxed bond lengths from @xmath18 to @xmath19 are 1.36 , 1.40 , 1.39 , 1.37 , 1.42 , and 1.37  , respectively , and the bond angles from @xmath20 to @xmath21 are 122.8@xmath22 , 120.6@xmath22 , 117.5@xmath22 , and 126.6@xmath22 , respectively.,width=321 ]    -passivated agnrs .",
    "( b ) pdos of the c , n , and o atoms in no@xmath0-agnrs . here ,",
    "w=18.,width=321 ]    no@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 radicals are widely used as anchoring or side groups for making single molecular junctions in molecular electronics .",
    "@xcite in the next calculations , no@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 are attached to agnrs and we investigate how these addends impact gnr electronic structures . figs .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) show their band structures . figs . 3 ( c ) and ( d ) show their optimal geometric structures .",
    "the nh@xmath0 group lies in the agnr plane for nh@xmath0 passivated gnrs , while , for no@xmath0 passivated gnrs , the dihedral angle is 59@xmath22 between agnr and no@xmath0 plane . according to the projected dos in figure 4",
    ", their electronic structures also exhibit different features . for the nh@xmath0-passivated agnrs , the nitrogen atom forms one sp@xmath8 orbital , which bonds to two hydrogen and one edge carbon atom .",
    "the remaining p@xmath23 orbital of the nitrogen atom bonds nicely to the p@xmath23 orbital of the edge carbon . for the no@xmath0 case , the @xmath17 orbital in the no@xmath0 plane",
    "does not bond well to the sp@xmath8 framework of agnrs because the no@xmath0 plane twists out of the agnr sheet .",
    "comparing to the bandgaps of h- and f - passivated agnrs , it is interesting to note that the bandgap of no@xmath0 is close to that of h , while the bandgap of nh@xmath0 is similar to that of f. the fundamental cause is attributed to the influences of the carbon p@xmath23 orbital .",
    "neither h nor no@xmath0 forms a bond with the carbon p@xmath23 orbital , but both f and nh@xmath0 facilitate bonding directly to carbon p@xmath23 orbital .",
    "hence , it is expected that substantial charge transfer occurs together with the non - negligible change in the hopping integral near the edges of both f- and nh@xmath0-passivated agnrs .",
    "very recently , n - rich oligoacences were considered to be candidates for n - channel organic semiconductors.@xcite n - doped carbon nanotubes and nanofibers have also been synthesized and investigated intensively over the past years.@xcite these investigations motivate us to examine the n - passivated agnrs . according to the calculated formation energy in table 1 , it is possible to attach one n atom to each c atom along the edges as an addend .",
    "interestingly , two neighboring n addends can form an n - n dimer and form an optimal structure .",
    "the n - n bond length is 1.30  , which is 0.20  longer than that of n - n bond length in n@xmath0 molecule .",
    "more importantly , a semiconductor - to - metal transition is observed for all n - passivated agnrs and this transition is independent of agnr widths . to explore the cause at the microscopic scale , the band structures of n - passivated agnrs with various graphene widths and partial projected dos on n atoms of agnr with width w=18 are presented in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , respectively .",
    "clearly , the dos near the fermi level is impacted by n addends .",
    "the edge n atom has 5 valence electrons .",
    "two of them stay as a lone - pair , which locates in the agnr plane with the direction pointing outwards . the occupied band labeled with  a  \" in fig .",
    "5(a ) has the same features as those of lone - pair electrons .",
    "the other three electrons exhibit sp@xmath8-like hybridization .",
    "two of the sp@xmath8 hybridized orbital pair with the neighboring c and n atoms to form two @xmath24 bonds , while the last electron acts as a @xmath17 electron .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the metallic state of n - passivated agnrs is predominantly contributed by the edge states of n addends .",
    "there are two reasons attributed to agnr s semiconducting to metallic transition .",
    "i ) the n - n bond is mainly composed of 2s and @xmath25 orbitals . the energy of the band with n @xmath26 is above the fermi surface , which means that n @xmath26 electrons fill the carbon @xmath27 bands and push the fermi surface inside the carbon s @xmath27 bands .",
    "ii ) the lone - pair electrons of n atoms are mainly in n @xmath28 bands and the top part of @xmath28 bands pass the fermi surface .",
    "this feature contributes to the semiconducting to the metallic transition .",
    "clearly , edge n - n addends extend the sp@xmath8 network of agnrs and thus the effective width ( or the number of sp@xmath8 dimer lines ) of n - passivated agnrs increases by 2 ( coming from two edge sides ) .",
    "apart from  a  \" band , the band structures of n - passivated agnrs with width w are similar to those of h or f - passivated agnrs with width @xmath29 except that the fermi level shifts upwards and cross the lowest unoccupied bands , which leads to the semiconductor - to - metal transition .",
    "in summary , we perform the first - principle calculations on the electronic structures of agnrs with various edge chemical modifications .",
    "we find that the energy gap can be tuned to be either metallic or semiconducting by attaching different chemical functional addends .",
    "after agnrs are passivated by h , f , nh@xmath0 , and no@xmath0 , the gnrs with the smallest bandgaps ( i.e. w=20 ) remain to have the smallest bandgaps . however , agnrs that have the largest bandgaps behave differently and the gaps depend on the type of elements used for passivation .",
    "h and f have similar bandgaps to no@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 , respectively , which can be explained based on the bonding of the carbon p@xmath23 orbital .",
    "the fascinating observation is that agnrs passivated by attaching n atoms can change from semiconducting to metallic material regardless of agnr width .",
    "this result is analyzed in detail based on its electronic structure .",
    "the unique electronic structure of the n - n bond , which is responsible for semiconductor - to - metal transition , is explained based on its 2s and @xmath25 orbital , and the lone - pair of @xmath28 .",
    "this tunable character of agnrs is useful in developing graphene - based molecule electronic devices in the near future .",
