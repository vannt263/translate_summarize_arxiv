    "since the first discovery of psr  b1821@xmath724 in m28 ( lyne et al . 1987 ) , 143 pulsarspfreire / gcpsr.html ] have been discovered in 27 globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "while the majority of gc pulsars are thought to have been formed in low - mass x - ray binary systems , in which the neutron star has been spun up to millisecond periods by the transfer of matter from an evolved companion ( see , e.g. camilo & rasio 2005 for a recent review ) , a small minority of the gc pulsar population appear to be similar to the isolated `` normal '' pulsars which inhabit the disk of our galaxy ( i.e. spin periods ( @xmath8 ) of several hundred ms , characteristic ages ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10@xmath11 yr , and inferred dipole magnetic field strengths ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath13@xmath14  gauss ) .",
    "these pulsars were originally discussed by lyne et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who noted that , since no significant star formation has occurred in gcs in the last billion years ( briley et al . 1994 ) , this population appears to be highly anomalous .",
    "lyne et al .  ( 1996 ) also note that the young pulsars appear in metal - rich gcs .",
    "this trend has persisted despite fifteen years of intense searches of most of the cluster population .",
    "a goal of this work is to investigate the statistical and astrophysical significance of this result .",
    "recent improvements in observational systems over the past decade have led to a wealth of discoveries of pulsars in gcs .",
    "sensitive radio surveys for pulsars have been conducted on almost 100 gcs to date .",
    "the two most fruitful have been terzan  5 ( ransom et al . 2005 ) and 47  tucanae ( freire et al .  2001 ) with 34 and 23 pulsars respectively . neither of these clusters harbor any normal pulsars , which we will henceforth define as being pulsars with spin periods @xmath15  ms and inferred magnetic field strengths @xmath16  gauss .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , given that the significant selection effects known to hamper the detection of binary and millisecond pulsars in clusters ( camilo & rasio 2005 ) are not as severe for normal isolated pulsars .    clearly , some physical mechanism is at work which produces these apparently young pulsars in gcs in a different way to how we believe they are formed in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "one possible method is the collapse of a white dwarf via an electron capture supernova in a binary or collisional system ( ivanova et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the statistics of the normal pulsars based on the results of recent surveys , and recent studies of the galactic population of normal pulsars ( faucher - gigure & kaspi 2006 ( hereafter fk06 ) ; ridley & lorimer 2010 ) . in  [ sec : sample ] , we review the current sample of normal pulsars in gcs . in  [ sec : fluxlimits ] , we compile a list of flux - density detection limits for 97 gcs based on published searches and some recent unpublished results . in  [ sec : statistics ] , we use these limits to characterize the population of young pulsars . in  [ sec : intrinsic ] we discuss the intrinsic population and birth rate of young pulsars in gcs . in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss formation scenarios and future work with young globular cluster pulsars .",
    "at least three , possibly four , young pulsars are known in two or three gcs .",
    "these four pulsars are b1718@xmath17 in ngc  6342 , b1745@xmath18 in ngc  6640 , and j1823@xmath19b and j1823@xmath19c in ngc  6624 .",
    "the properties of these pulsars are summarized in table  [ tab : sample ] and their gc properties relevant to this data analysis can be seen in table  [ table : gclim ] . as can be seen by inspecting their position with respect to other normal galactic field pulsars on the @xmath8@xmath20 diagram shown in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] ,",
    "these pulsars appear to be consistent with the distribution of normal pulsars in the galactic disk .",
    "two long - period pulsars are not included in this compilation .",
    "firstly , the 110-ms pulsar b2127 + 11a in gc ngc  7078 which is known to have a negative period derivative due to contamination by the cluster potential and nearby stars ( wolszczan et al . 1989 ) . as discussed by these authors , the pulsar most likely has a small intrinsic period derivative indicating that it has undergone some recycling in a binary system which has subsequently been disrupted due to close encounters in the cluster .",
    "it is also noted that a recent measurement of the second period derivative of @xmath21 = @xmath22 @xmath23 for this pulsar is entirely consistent with encounters with nearby stars in the cluster ( jacoby et al .",
    "another long - period pulsar which we do not consider to be young is the 110-ms pulsar j1750@xmath737a in gc ngc  6441 ( freire et al .",
    "this is a member of an eccentric binary system and its low period derivative places it closer to the region of the @xmath8@xmath20 diagram occupied by the double neutron star binary systems and the eccentric neutron star ",
    "white dwarf binaries ( see figure  [ fig : ppdot ] ) .",
    "one other caveat needs to be discussed with the sample of young pulsars present in this paper .",
    "psr  b1718@xmath719 may not truly be a member of ngc  6342 and is the only pulsar located near ngc  6342 .",
    "an earlier discussion of this subject is presented in bailes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and a further expansion will be presented here .",
    "the original paper used psr  b1718@xmath719 s position , binary status , and dispersion measure ( dm ) to argue for its association with ngc  6342 .",
    "its position of 2.3  away from the cluster s center is 3 times greater then the half - mass radius of the cluster .",
    "all other young pulsars presented in table  [ tab : sample ] and a majority of all globular cluster pulsars with timing solutions are found within the half - mass radius .",
    "the dm of 75.7  pc  @xmath24 for psr  b1718@xmath719 is somewhat below the predicted values of 120  pc @xmath25 using dm = 20/sin(@xmath26 ) pc @xmath25 ( lyne et al .",
    "1995 ) where @xmath26 = 9.72@xmath27 , 130  pc @xmath25 ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) , or 229  pc @xmath25 ( cordes & lazio 2002 ) .",
    "these dm models are uncertain , but factors in the range of 1.5 to 3 are larger than the known differences for sources within @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 of the galactic plane .",
    "the unusual binary nature of psr  b1718@xmath719 gives support to its association with ngc  6342 due to its existence as a eclipsing low - mass binary pulsar ( freire 2005 ) and due to the fact that the proportion of pulsars with binary companions is about two orders of magnitude greater for gc pulsars than galactic field pulsars ( lyne et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the following sections ,",
    "given the lack of clear evidence for or against the association , the results are discussed both with and without the inclusion of psr  b1718@xmath719 and will be explicitly stated when psr  b1718@xmath719 is not included .",

    "the pulsar population data are taken from the atnf pulsar database ( manchester et al 2005 ) . ]",
    "to carry out the statistical analysis of this sample , it is necessary to have a substantial compilation of upper limits from gcs that have been searched for such pulsars .",
    "table 2 gives our compilation of flux density limits at 1400  mhz for searches of each cluster , @xmath43 and gc properties relevant to this work .",
    "the main surveys that were used are hessels et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , lynch & ransom  ( 2011 ) , lynch et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and possenti et al .",
    "the rest of the gcs had their flux limits taken from the most recent discovery paper .",
    "if the paper did not quote a flux limit , one was derived using the survey parameters from the paper using the radiometer equation for pulsars which gives    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a digitization correction faction , @xmath46 is the minimum signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath47 is the system temperature of the telescope , @xmath48 is the gain of the telescope , @xmath49 is the number of polarizations summed , @xmath50 is the observation time , @xmath51 is the bandwidth of the backend , and @xmath52 is the fractional pulse width ( lorimer & kramer 2005 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath49 are all taken from the relevant survey paper .",
    "the values for @xmath48 and @xmath45 can be obtained from the websites or papers that give the telescope and backend specifications . @xmath46 and @xmath52 are parameters that are chosen to have values of 8 and 0.1 respectively .",
    "@xmath47 can be expressed as :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the receiver temperature , @xmath55 is the cosmic background temperature , @xmath56 is the galactic synchrotron temperature , @xmath57 is the spillover temperature from sources in the side lobes of the telescope , and @xmath58 is the increase in system temperature due to terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "the values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are well known , but @xmath57 and @xmath58 can vary greatly with time and telescope position causing large uncertainties in @xmath47 and can only truly be obtained by proper calibration . due to pulsar survey observations rarely ever having accurate calibration , the expression for @xmath47 has been simplified to include only the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "one last fact to mention is that , due to these pulsars having long periods , dm smearing and scattering are unlikely to be important and are not considered in this work .    for any surveys which were not carried out at 1400  mhz ,",
    "the quoted limits are scaled from the observing frequency to 1400  mhz using a simple power law @xmath59 , which is consistent with the average spectral behavior for a large sample of normal pulsars ( lorimer et al .",
    "for all clusters listed in table  [ table : gclim ] , we can use the flux density limits to model the most likely number of potentially observable pulsars . ] in each cluster . using a binomial data model ,",
    "we carry out a simple bayesian analysis described below .",
    "this method rests on a key simplifying assumption about the luminosity function of young pulsars . following faucher - gigure & kaspi ( 2006 )",
    ", we will assume that the parent population follows a log - normal luminosity function defined ( at 1400  mhz ) to have a mean in the base-10 logarithm of @xmath60 ( in mjy ) to be @xmath71.1 and a standard deviation of 0.9 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if we consider that the spin - down evolution of isolated pulsars in gcs is the same as the galactic disk .",
    "variations on the mean and standard deviation of the log - normal luminosity function have been applied to our analysis using models from ridley & lorimer ( 2010 ) .",
    "these values are in the range of @xmath71.04 to @xmath71.19 for the mean of the luminosity function in the base-10 and in the range of 0.91 to 0.98 for the standard deviation .",
    "we can model the number of pulsars in a particular cluster , @xmath61 , given a `` detection probability '' @xmath62 and an observed sample of @xmath63 pulsars .",
    "bayes theorem gives the joint posterior probability density for @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the probability of observing @xmath63 pulsars from a parent population of @xmath61 with some @xmath62 , and @xmath66 is the joint prior probability density for @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ". the prior distribution for @xmath61 is assumed to be uniform in the range @xmath63 to @xmath67 .",
    "graphically , @xmath62 is the ratio of the area under the luminosity function for @xmath68 to the total area under the function .",
    "we evaluate @xmath62 numerically using monte carlo integration of the faucher - gigure & kaspi ( 2006 ) luminosity function and four luminosity functions from ridley & lorimer ( 2010 ) .",
    "the prior distribution for @xmath62 is assumed to be independent of @xmath61 and uniform in the range @xmath69 to @xmath70 , which are defined to be the minimum and maximum probabilities from the five distribution functions .",
    "the simplest choice for a likelihood function is the binomial distribution , i.e. @xmath71 where @xmath62 depends on the luminosity limit and the assumed parent luminosity function .    for the majority of cases",
    "in which there are no detections in a cluster , @xmath72 and the likelihood term simplifies considerably to @xmath73 for the cases of ngc 6440 and ngc 6342 , where there is one detection , i.e. @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 while for the two pulsars in ngc 6624 , @xmath76 which leads to @xmath77 having found the joint posterior distribution @xmath78 , we then marginalize over @xmath62 to get the posterior distribution for @xmath61 using the appropriate choice for the likelihood function ( i.e.  eq .  [ equ : n0 ] , [ equ : n1 ] , or [ equ : n2 ] depending on the value for @xmath63 in each case ) and give the 95% percentile - based credible intervals for @xmath61 ( i.e.  the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles ) as well as the median in table  [ table : gcbin ] .",
    "examples of these discrete probability density functions can be seen in figure  [ fig : dpf ] for four gcs .",
    "47  tuc shows the typical shape of a discrete probability density function for a gc with no young pulsars .",
    "the results from the previous sections do not take into account the population of young pulsars whose emission beams do not intersect our line of sight or the population of young pulsars which escaped the gravitational potential of their parent gcs .",
    "both of these issues are addressed in this section .",
    "retention fractions ( @xmath79 ) , the fraction of pulsars which do not have a large enough birth velocity to escape the cluster s gravitational potential , are calculated for each gc . these @xmath79 are obtained by using the escape velocity of the gc and a velocity distribution function .",
    "hobbs et al . ( 2005 ) showed that a maxwellian distribution fits the galactic population of pulsars well for many categories ( all , young , recycled , etc . ) of pulsars , hence we choose the velocity distribution function to have the form of a maxwellian with a dispersion @xmath80 .",
    "caution does need to be taken with this choice of velocity distribution function because no physical mechanism is presented in hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to explain this maxwellian distribution and the low velocity end of this distribution is not well constrained due to the fact low velocity pulsar s proper motions are difficult to measure .",
    "multiple values were chosen for @xmath80 : 265 km  s@xmath2 from hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , an intermediate value of 130 km  s@xmath2 , 50 km  s@xmath2 , 20 km  s@xmath2 , and 10 km  s@xmath2 as a lower value .",
    "many separate values have been chosen because it is most likely that these young gc pulsars are formed from electron capture supernovae for which the accompanying natal kick may be 10 times smaller than in the case of core collapse supernova ( ivanova et al .",
    "2008 , kitaura et al .",
    "the escape velocities were taken from gnedin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) except for eso 452 which came from webbink ( 1985 ) .",
    "the retention fractions are calculated by numerically integrating the maxwellian velocity distribution function from 0 to the escape velocity of the gcs .",
    "each retention fraction was used to calculate a theoretical upper limit for the number of young pulsars produced for every gc    @xmath81    where @xmath61 represents the number of pulsars predicted by the binomial method , i.e the median in table  [ table : gcbin ] , and @xmath82 is the beaming fraction for pulsars . the value taken for the pulsar beaming fraction is 0.1 ( tauris & manchester 1998 ) .",
    "this value represents an upper limit on the number of pulsars created in a particular gc . the number of pulsars created in a gc is then divided by the average life time of a young pulsar ( 43 myr ) to obtain upper limits on the birth rates ( @xmath83 ) for each gc .",
    "an average lifetime of 43 myr is derived by taking the total number of radio - loud pulsars ( 1,200,000 ) and dividing it by the pulsar birthrate ( 2.8  psrs per century ) in fk06 .",
    "all results from the binomial analysis are contained within table  [ table : gcbin ] .",
    "one gc , m22 , has median value of zero and no young pulsars are expected to be contained within it .",
    "this results in a birth rate of zero for m22 . to calculate a birth rate for this",
    "gc , it is assumed that the cluster contains one pulsar and an upper limit is constructed using this assumption .",
    "up to this point , the analysis presented uses flux density limits and luminosity models as the only considerations for observable pulsars contained within the cluster .",
    "lyne et al .  ( 1996 ) note that the young pulsars appear in metal - rich gcs and this trend has persisted despite fifteen years of intense searches of most of the cluster population . in this section metallicity",
    "will also be added as a consideration . for the following discussion terzan  5",
    "will be excluded due to the possibility that it is not a true gc but a merger of two astrophysical objects that are bound in the galactic halo ( ferraro et al .",
    "also excluded will be b1718@xmath17 in ngc  6342 due to the uncertainty about its membership to its cluster ( see  [ sec : sample ] ) .    the gcs ngc  6440 and ngc  6624 have metallicities that are greater than the @xmath84 percentile of metal rich clusters .",
    "these two clusters are two of the three highest metallicity clusters that contain either young or old millisecond pulsars .",
    "the probability of selecting two gcs in the top three of a ranked list from a sample of 25 gcs is 0.92 % .",
    "if ngc  6342 is also included in this sample then we have three of the top five highest metallicity clusters with a probability of selecting three of the top five of 0.38 % .",
    "the inclusion of terzan  5 ( the highest metallicity cluster with any known pulsars ) in both of these previous scenarios , changes the probability values from 0.92 % to 1.71 % and 0.38 % to 0.68 % . the conjecture can be proposed that metal - poor clusters have been selected against for the purpose of surveying gcs due to the belief that metal - rich gcs contain more pulsars overall .",
    "figure  [ fig : lim ] shows a plot of metallicity versus survey luminosity limit , indicating a random distribution with no bias towards either low or high metallicity clusters .",
    "figure  [ cdf : met ] shows the empirical cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the number of predicted young pulsars with the binomial method versus metallicity .",
    "gcs with distances greater than 20 kpc are excluded from this cdf because their large distances produce high luminosity limits and in turn creates jumps in the cdf .",
    "the cause of these jumps seen in figure  [ cdf : met ] is due to high survey limits on specific gcs .",
    "the first large jump in the cdf at a metallicity of @xmath850.55 is due to ngc  6342 , the gc with the highest survey luminosity limit .",
    "the gcs with the most known pulsars , ter  5 and 47  tuc , have high metallicities and have been used in many simulations .",
    "one of these presented in ivanova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) attempts to model the number of young / high magnetic field pulsars in these clusters . in these simulations , 3 and 2 young pulsars",
    "are predicted to exist in the cores of ter  5 and 47  tuc respectively with the most likely creation scenario being the merger of two stars .",
    "if beaming and luminosity limits from table  [ table : gclim ] are taken into account , the chances of seeing those 2 - 3 pulsars are extremely small .",
    "the results of the binomial analysis depend greatly on the luminosity limits provided from searching these gcs .",
    "one can see by comparing the discrete probability density functions of ngc  6342 and ngc  6440 seen in figure  [ fig : dpf ] , that the range of values that each function covers differs greatly .",
    "this is a direct result of ngc  6342 s flux luminosity limit being much greater than that of ngc  6440 .",
    "thus clusters with high flux luminosity limits do not significantly constrain the population / birth rates of these gcs .",
    "another factor not mentioned is the influence of rfi on searching gcs .",
    "the relative impact of rfi on long - period pulsars is much more severe than for millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "there is a lot more long - period rfi and the dispersion discrimination between rfi and long - period pulsars is not nearly as great as for msps .",
    "therefore this creates a bias against finding such pulsars because they may be ignored assuming they are rfi which is hard to quantify and fully account for .      for most gcs ,",
    "the birth rates found are only upper limits with the exception of ngc  6342 , ngc  6440 , and ngc  6624 .",
    "empirical cdfs of these values can be seen in figure  [ cdf : bir ] for the 97 gcs surveyed .",
    "the upper limits on birth rates for velocity dispersions of 265 , 130 , 50 , 20 , and 10 km  s@xmath2 are 3568 , 422 , 24.8 , 1.67 , and 0.25 pulsars per century respectively .",
    "the higher birth rates obtained from the higher velocity dispersions is an effect of needing to produce more pulsars to get enough pulsars at the low velocity end of the maxwellian distribution .",
    "these values for birth rates provided in this work are much higher then the predicted birth of 2.8 pulsars per century for the galaxy as a whole for larger velocity dispersions ( faucher - gigure & kaspi 2006 ) .",
    "the impact on the galactic population from pulsars escaping gcs will be discussed elsewhere ( lynch et al . , in prep ) . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "these very high implied birth rates suggest that a very different formation process for young pulsars is occurring in gcs , as well as the possibility that some gcs do not produce young pulsars at all .",
    "the major difference in the formation scenario appears to be the lower velocity dispersion at birth .      in section 5.2",
    ", evidence is presented that young pulsars are only present in higher metallicity gcs . another way to highlight",
    "this is to use a simple population model with the gc s mass as the only variable .",
    "a pulsar to mass ratio ( pmr ) is derived using the results of the binomial analysis for ngc 6440 and ngc 6624 , each having 10 and 21 pulsars predicted respectively .",
    "we do not include the gc ngc 6342 when creating this model because of the uncertain cluster membership of b1718@xmath719 ( see  [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "with ngc 6440 s mass of 811,000 @xmath86 and ngc 6624 s mass of 257,000 @xmath86 a pmr of 31 pulsars per 1,068,000 @xmath86 is obtained . using the pmr",
    "each of the 97 gcs are revisited and an intrinsic population is predicted for each gc by multiplying the pmr by the gc mass . using the flux density limits in table  [ table : gclim ] , the observable population is drawn from the faucher - gigure & kaspi ( 2006 ) luminosity model .",
    "the results of this simulation can be seen in a histogram in figure  [ his : mass ] and table  [ table : gcbin ] .",
    "seventy - four percent of the gcs are predicted to have no observable young pulsars using this model .",
    "however , for the remaining gcs , a total of 67 young pulsars should be observable which disagrees with the current population of 3 by over an order of magnitude .",
    "these results show that mass is not a single determining factor in a gc containing young pulsar .",
    "based on the observed population of young pulsars in the higher metallicity gcs , it may be suggested that lower metallicity gcs may not produce any young pulsars .",
    "figure  [ cdf : bir ] may be used to predict birth rates as a function of metallicity . given that no young pulsars are observed with metallicities below @xmath87 , this value is adopted as a cut - off value . in this case , the population of young pulsars in gcs with log[fe / h ] @xmath88 @xmath87 is @xmath4 , at @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the birth rate for gcs with log[fe / h ] @xmath88 @xmath87 of @xmath6 pulsars per century .",
    "a few possible situations need to be examined that could explain this current population of normal pulsars in globular clusters .",
    "blue stragglers are the product of the merger of two or possibly three @xmath891@xmath86 main sequence stars ( leonard , 1989 ) or binary accretion of a binary companion(s ) ( mccrea , 1964 )",
    ". they can not be the progenitors of the young pulsars because they are not massive enough to core collapse .",
    "the creation of these normal pulsars from electron capture supernova ( ecs ) of oxygen - neon - magnesium ( onemg ) white dwarfs is another possible avenue .",
    "there are three main types of ecss : accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) , evolution - induced collapse ( eic ) , and merger - induced collapse ( mic ) , of which aic is the most common ( ivanova et al .",
    "2008 ) . from conservation of magnetic flux ,",
    "a five order of magnitude change in surface magnetic field is available from an aic of a white dwarf into a neutron star .",
    "this would require a white dwarf to have at least @xmath90 gauss magnetic field to produce the magnetic field of the young pulsar with the largest magnetic field contained within a gc .",
    "white dwarfs have been observed with magnetic field above @xmath91 gauss and could account up to @xmath92 of the white dwarf population ( liebert et al 2003 ) .",
    "ecss could be an avenue for the creation of young pulsars .",
    "not all white dwarfs that pass the chandrasekhar limit will collapse via ecs , some will be type ia supernova .",
    "ecs provide two qualities that are needed to explain the presence of young pulsars in gcs .",
    "the first is the low velocity dispersion which is needed to keep these young pulsars in their host gcs .",
    "the initial formation of the white dwarf results in a small velocity kick of a few km / s from either stellar winds or an asymmetric kick during the helium flash ( fregeau et al .",
    "the energetics of the ecs of the white dwarf would produce a small velocity kick ( dessart et al .",
    "2006 ) and , combined with the velocity kick from previous stages of evolution , would provide a total velocity that is small and would allow most neutron stars created via ecs to be retained by the gc .",

    "this provides a source of iron creating the higher metallicity for clusters in which all known young pulsars have been detected .",
    "a simple statistical analysis can give an order of magnitude estimate of the possible population of heavy mass ( 1.01.4  @xmath86 ) white dwarfs available for ecss .",
    "it is taken that all gcs have the same initial mass function ( imf ) and the differences seen between current gc s mass functions are due to the dynamical history of the cluster ( paust et al .",
    "the imf is a multi - part power - law presented in equation  4 of kroupa ( 2002 ) and with @xmath97 = @xmath72.7 from scola ( 1986 ) .",
    "each gc is assumed to have the same age of 12.4 gyr for purposes of predicting an initial mass of the gc ( krauss & chaboyer 2001 ) .",
    "an initial mass is obtained for each gc by using the mass lost fractions presented in kroupa ( 2002 ) for @xmath97 = @xmath72.7 .",
    "the number of main sequence stars available for heavy white dwarfs ( mass range of 6.0 - 8.0 @xmath86 ) are calculated for each gc with a total of @xmath89150,000 white dwarfs formed in these 97 gcs .",
    "the use of values for @xmath97 greater then @xmath72.7 serves only to decrease the numbers of stars in this mass range while choosing the salpeter index of @xmath97 = @xmath72.35 only increases the number of stars available by a factor of 2 . assuming an interaction age of @xmath98 years and that each heavy white dwarf creates one ecs , an occurrence rate of @xmath99 ecss per century is obtained and is shown on figure  [ cdf : bir ] as a solid horizontal black line .",
    "this predicted ecs rate is an order of magnitude less than the birth rates of pulsars for the lowest velocity dispersion .",
    "a few factors could bring these values into closer agreement .",
    "a decrease in the interaction age would increase the ecs rate .",
    "this is a very plausible possibility because there is an accumulation of ecss at more recent times due to dynamical evolution ( it may take a long time for a given capture to form an accreting binary ) and individual evolution ( it may take several gyrs to accrete enough mass to cause an ecs ) .",
    "lower luminosity limits without the detection of more young pulsars would decrease the young pulsar birth rate and bring the two rates closer to agreement .",
    "a detailed @xmath61-body simulation should be used to refine the ecs rate but this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is possible that ecss have only occurred in higher metallicity cluster and not all gcs should be considered in calculating the birthrate of young pulsars .",
    "the work presented here suggests that ecs is the most likely creation scenario for young pulsars in gcs .",

    "the fourth , psr b1718@xmath719 , has a characteristic age about equal to ngc 6342 s relaxation time and this could explain why psr b1718@xmath719 is not located in the host gc s core .",
    "this could also explain why these young pulsars are towards the higher end of the age distribution for non - recycled pulsars .",
    "the metallicity of the galactic center is higher than that of the galactic disk and stars migrating from the bulge to bulge gcs could explain why gcs with young pulsars have higher metallicities compared to the overall gc population .",
    "the population of bulge pulsars is relatively unexplored .",
    "outside of galactic center surveys ( deneva et al , 2009 ; johnston et al , 2006 ; klein et al , 2004 ; & kramer et al , 2000 ) and the surveys of bulge gcs ( table  [ table : gclim ] ) , the population is unknown .",
    "the most sensitive published survey to explore this region is the parkes multi - beam survey ( manchester et al , 2001 ) . for pulsars with a period of 100 - 1000 ms",

    "these @xmath102 values represent the upper edge of the pulsar luminosity function presented in fk06 and show that the galactic bulge has not been surveyed well enough to constrain its pulsar population especially considering dm smearing and scattering would further hinder the detection of these pulsars .    another chance for pulsars to be captured will occur when the gc passes through the plane of the galaxy as it orbits the galactic center .",
    "the orbital timescales for globular clusters around the galaxy are hundreds of myrs and this is longer than the 43 myr average lifetime of a normal pulsar .",
    "this means that any pulsars picked up would have to have been picked up on the most recent pass of the gc through the galactic disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppdot ] shows a small population of pulsars that would live long enough to be found in a gc if capture occurred due to this scenario .",
    "the plausibility of star capture by a gc is discussed in mieske & baumgardt ( 2007 ; henceforth mb07 ) and their arguments will be applied here in the following discussions .",
    "table  [ tab : gcbul ] lists all gcs within 1.5  kpc of the galactic center and their characteristics relevant to the mb07 analysis .",
    "mb07 found that the capture probability decreases with increasing number of cluster particles ( @xmath104 ) and decreases with increasing initial velocity over cluster velocity dispersion ratio ( @xmath105 ) . assuming an average particle mass of 0.5  @xmath86 , the range of clusters reviewed matches with the range of galactic bulge clusters , however the range of @xmath105 do not .",
    "gc velocity dispersions range from @xmath89 1.0 - 19  km  s@xmath2 , which are an order of magnitude less than typical pulsar velocities in previous studies ( see hobbs et al .",
    "2005 , for a recent study ) .",
    "the closest scenario of @xmath105 equal to unity will be the only one considered from here .    to obtain a comparison of capture rates between pulsars and mb07",
    ", a few other considerations need to be put into place . using the fk06 model for the galactic pulsar population",
    ", the mass density of pulsars is found to be 8.2@xmath106 @xmath86 @xmath107 for the galactic bulge assuming a uniform pulsar per mass distribution throughout the galaxy .",
    "this value is five orders of magnitude less than the value of 0.25 @xmath86 @xmath107 used in mb07 .",
    "even if the entire pulsar population were placed inside the galactic bulge , this would increase the mass density by only an order of magnitude .",
    "the resulting differences in mass density would produce significantly lower values for the rates found by mb07 .",
    "the value of 265  km  s@xmath2 will be adopted as the velocity dispersion for field pulsars ( @xmath108 ) . for a @xmath108 of 200  km",
    "s@xmath2 mb07 concludes that no stars will be captured in any mass cluster within a hubble time .",
    "if the additional constraints for pulsars of lower capture probability due to higher initial velocities and lower capture rates due to lower mass density are included , the conclusion can be drawn that no pulsars are likely to be captured by a gc .",
    "imposing further constraints of beaming , luminosity limits , and finite radio - loud lifetimes for pulsars would further hinder the detection of a pulsar if one were to be captured by a gc .",
    "we therefore rule out this possibility as an origin for the young pulsars in gcs .",
    "all the work presented here only provides a statistical study at the young pulsar population in gcs and neglects the dynamics and history of each gc .",
    "clearly n - body simulations similar to those presented in ivanova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) of the gcs and their possible interactions with the galactic stellar and post - stellar populations would place better constraints on the values presented here and would further the understanding of gc s dynamics and evolutionary history .    to improve upon the observational constraints used in this work , it is clearly desirable to search all gcs as deeply as possible using existing facilities .",
    "we highlight here some gcs of particular interest .",
    "there are a few exceptions , most notably ngc  6342 which has the highest minimum detectable flux density of any of the 97 gcs and has not to our knowledge been surveyed since the discovery of b1718@xmath719 by lyne et al .",
    "a new search with the currently available telescopes could reduce the @xmath109 by a factor of 10 and provide evidence for or against psr  b1718@xmath719 association with ngc 6342 ( bailes et al .",
    "2005 , freire 2005 ) .",
    "another high metallicity bulge gc to be searched is ngc  6637 ( m  69 ) .",
    "this cluster , at a distance of 8.8 kpc , also has a high two - body encounter rate , @xmath110 .",
    "this parameter is often used to assess the plausibility of pulsar content in gcs ( see , e.g. , hui et al . 2010 ) .",
    "most of the gcs presented in this work have been searched to the sensitivity limit of the telescope for which they are visible .",
    "the next generation of radio telescopes will be needed to present better constraints on this work .",
    "the square kilometer array ( ska ) would be an ideal telescope to accomplish this task .",
    "the ska would provide over a factor of one hundred increase in telescope gain over the gbt , parkes , and jodrell bank telescopes and over a factor of thirty in telescope gain over arecibo .",
    "this improvement in gain alone would allow for deep searches , with luminosity limits less than the mean in the faucher - gigure & kaspi ( 2006 ) model , in only an hour or two for gcs less than twenty kpc away ( see smits et al , 2009 for pulsar work with the ska ) . before the advent of the ska , meerkat , the south african ska precursor",
