    "barium titanate is a typical representative of perovskite ferroelectrics , which undergoes a cubic - to - tetragonal structural phase transition at the curie temperature @xmath3 k. the soft - mode nature of this transition has been determined by neutron scattering @xcite as well as by hyper - raman scattering @xcite , however , some open questions concerning the role played by the ti ions have so far remained unanswered .",
    "chaves et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a thermodynamic model following the assumption of comes et al .",
    "@xcite that the ti ion occupies one of the eight equivalent off - center sites along the @xmath1 $ ] directions , which predicts a nonzero microscopic dipole moment of each unit cell and hence a transition of an order - disorder type .",
    "the off - center displacements of ti ions in the high - temperature cubic phase of batio@xmath0 have recently been confirmed by nmr experiments @xcite , which revealed the order - disorder dynamics of ti ions to be coexisting with the observable displacive features of the to soft mode .",
    "this immediately raises the question about the appropriate theoretical model for batio@xmath0 and related systems , as the widely accepted soft - mode description implies a central position of the ti ion in the high temperature cubic phase , leading to a phase transition of a purely displacive type .",
    "also , first - principles calculations of the electronic structure @xcite do not support the idea that the ferroelectric distortion is due to the ti ion ` rattling ' in the oxygen cage .",
    "some general features of the two types of phase transition have been discussed by aubry @xcite on the basis of a linear coupled double - well model .",
    "the crossover between the order - disorder and displacive transition was investigated by means of molecular dynamics calculations by stachiotti et al .",
    "@xcite who used a two - dimensional shell model of oxide perovskites .",
    "a microscopic tretament of perovskite ferroelectrics has been carried out by girshberg and yacoby ( gy ) @xcite , who describe the degrees of freedom associated with the off - center displacements in terms of ising pseudospin operators and introduce a linear pseudospin - phonon coupling .",
    "they derive an effective coupling between the off - center ions , which leads to a pseudospin ordering transition .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature is shifted from the instability temperature of the to soft mode .    in this paper",
    ", we make an attempt to develop a mesoscopic treatment which combines the order - disorder and displacive features of the phase transition .",
    "we introduce a simple mechanism at the mesoscopic level , which is closely related to the above gy model , i.e. , we adopt the linear coupling between the symmetrized occupation operators for the off - center ti sites and the normal coordinates for lattice displacements . assuming that on the time scale of ti intersite jumps most phonon modes are fast , we show that these modes essentially contribute to a renormalization of the static ti - ti interactions , which can be either ferro- or antiferro - distortive .",
    "meanwhile , close to the ti ordering transition the time scale of the soft to mode becomes asymptotically comparable to the characteristic time for the relaxation of the ti dipole moment",
    ". thus a new vibrational - orientational hybrid mode appears , which retains some of its original soft - mode character , however , its frequency and width is determined by the the relaxational dynamics of the ti subsystem .",
    "in addition to the hybrid mode , a purely relaxational mode describing the intersite jumps of the ti ions exists .",
    "it should be noted that the unperturbed to soft mode describes the anharmonic vibrations of all the ions , and thus also include the oscillations of ti ions around their average equilibrium positions .",
    "apart from the time scales involved , the conditions for the formation of a hybrid soft mode may also depend on the strength of the ti - phonon coupling , which thus plays the role of a control parameter in the present model .",
    "following chaves et al .",
    "@xcite we define the occupation probabilities @xmath4 for the off - center ti sites in the @xmath5-th unit cell , where @xmath6 according to the convention specified in ref .",
    "obviously , @xmath7 .",
    "next , we introduce a set of symmetry adapted linear combinations of the @xmath8 variables , which transform according to the irreducible representations @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and @xmath11 of the cubic group , @xmath12 @xmath13    @xmath14",
    "@xmath15    here we have omitted the cell index @xmath5 .",
    "the variables @xmath16 , where @xmath17 labels the symmetries in the above order , satisfy the relation @xmath18 this implies , for example , that the @xmath2 polar modes ( 3 ) can be effectively represented by three independent ising - type variables @xcite .",
    "we will assume that there exists a direct coupling between the symmetrized occupation probabilities or ` pseudospins ' @xmath16 due to long range dipolar interactions , which has the form @xmath19 in addition , we consider the interaction between the pseudospins and the phonon normal coordinates @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave vector and @xmath23 the branch index of lattice normal modes , @xmath24 the coupling constant , and @xmath25 the lattice vector .",
    "introducing the phonon momenta @xmath26 and frequencies @xmath27 , we can write down the phonon hamiltonian @xcite @xmath28 it has long been established that in batio@xmath0 and other perovskite ferroelectrics @xcite a soft to phonon mode exists . here",
    "we assume that the soft to mode has a wave vector @xmath29 and symmetry @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the corresponding branch index .",
    "the frequency of this soft mode vanishes at the stability limit @xmath32 in accordance with the cochran relation @xmath33 in the following we will limit ourselves to the case where the soft mode condenses at the zone center , i.e. , @xmath34 , as in batio@xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the pseudospin and phonon degrees of freedom can be decoupled by introducing displaced phonon coordinates @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 in this so - called adiabatic approach it is implied that the time scale for the ti ion motion is much longer than the period of oscillation for phonon modes , so that phonon coordinates @xmath20 adapt adiabatically to any change of the pseudospin coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "thus we obtain the adiabatic hamiltonian @xmath37 in the last term , the ti - ti coupling constant is given by @xmath38   \\ ; .",

    ", @xmath24 contains the contributions of both short- and long - range interactions between the ti and all the other ions .",
    "short - range interactions are expected to be primarily responsible for the local potential of the ti ion . indeed",
    ", first - principles calculations indicate that ferroelectricity in batio@xmath0 appears as the result of hybridization of the ti - o bond @xcite .",
    "therefore , the contribution of short - range forces to @xmath24 and hence to @xmath39 is expected to be dominant , although long - range electrostatic dipole - dipole interactions contained in @xmath40 are also needed to establish ferroelectric order @xcite .    the @xmath41 part of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ had ] ) has the same structure as the direct interaction ( [ hdir ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 for @xmath41 represents an additional interaction between the ti ions at two different sites , which together with the direct coupling @xmath40 can lead to an order - disorder transition into a @xmath2 polarized state of the ti subsystem . in general , this interaction involves two different symmetries @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and is real after being symmetrized with respect to the exchange @xmath44 .",
    "thus we can combine the two coupling constants @xmath40 and @xmath39 into a single coupling parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 terms in eq .",

    "the ordering is antiferroelectric .",
    "it should be stressed that in view of relation ( [ omg0 ] ) the interaction @xmath51 is , in general , temperature dependent .",
    "the off - diagonal coupling @xmath61 with @xmath62 leads to anisotropic interactions , which are assumed to be weaker than the isotropic part and can thus be treated by perturbation theory .",
    "below , we will discuss the possibility that anisotropic interactions give rise to time - dependent random fields acting on the pseudospin variables .    in a ferroelectric system like batio@xmath0 ,",
    "the main contribution to the coupling @xmath51 will come from the soft to mode with phonon coordinate @xmath63 and frequency @xmath64 as given by eq .",
    "( [ omg0 ] ) .",
    "the ti subsystem will undergo a phase transition into an ordered state with nonzero value of the pseudospin thermal average @xmath65 .",
    "the transition temperature is determined by the relation @xmath66 where we have substituted expression ( [ omg0 ] ) for @xmath67 and written @xmath68 . to evaluate @xmath69",

    "we will assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 , implying that @xmath76 , i.e. , the ordering takes place above the stability limit of the unperturbed soft mode .",
    "it can easily be seen that in the above case , the effect of @xmath73 is to shift @xmath77 towards higher temperatures .",
    "we now consider the response of the soft to phonon mode @xmath78 to a time - dependent electric field @xmath79 associated with an optic wave in a light scattering experiment .",
    "close to the transition , the time scales for the soft mode and for the relaxational motion of the ti ions become comparable , and the dynamics based on the adiabatic hamiltonian ( [ had ] ) is not applicable .",
    "the soft mode dynamics is governed by the corresponding part of the original hamiltonian , namely , @xmath80 [ hsm ] here @xmath81 is a coupling parameter involving the effective charge @xmath82 and reduced mass @xmath83 . for simplicity , we do not include the direct coupling between the light vector @xmath79 and the dipole moment associated with the ti - o bond .",
    "we could , in principle , assume a nonzero value of the off - center ti dipole moment , however , as shown by gy its contribution to the curie constant is negligible in other perovskite ferroelectrics and can thus be ignored .",
    "the time evolution of the soft - mode operators @xmath78 and @xmath84 is governed by the heisenberg equations of motion @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , the time dependent thermodynamic fluctuations of the variables @xmath86 will be assumed to exhibit a pure relaxational motion with a single characteristic relaxation time @xmath87 , i.e. , we will ignore the possibility of coherent dipole moment flips .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion can be obtained from the classical langevin model @xcite , which is based on the continuous or ` soft ' spin variables @xmath88 with effective hamiltonian @xmath89 for @xmath90 one recovers the discrete limit @xmath91 ( cf .",

    "we will ignore the frequency dependence of @xmath97 in the soft - mode regime .",
    "we can now introduce the static pseudospin response @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 and redefine the relaxation time by writing @xmath102 .",
    "the solution of the above equations can then be expressed in the form @xmath103 and @xmath104 where the random force term has been averaged out .",
    "( [ qe ] ) is similar , but not identical to the expression given by gy , which contains an extra term @xmath105 in the denominator , describing the damping of the to soft mode due to lattice anharmonicity .",
    "here we absorb this damping into the @xmath106 term by a proper redefinition the relaxation time @xmath107 .",
    "we now consider the @xmath108 case corresponding to a to soft mode at the zone center . dropping the subscripts @xmath31 and introducing the far - infrared dielectric response",
    "@xmath109 we get @xmath110 the contribution to the corresponding dielectric function is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the unit cell volume .    in the absence of pseudospin - phonon coupling , @xmath113 ,",

    "( [ ktc ] ) provided that @xmath119 .",
    "thus , in the above limit the critical temperature @xmath77 derived from the soft - mode dynamics will be precisely equal to the static value ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "this means that the hybrid soft mode becomes unstable at the static ordering temperature @xmath77 of the ti subsystem",
    ". it should be added that the technical reason for using the soft spin variables and langevin dynamics is the fact that only in this formalism we were able to properly take into account the presence of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ kq ] ) .    to illustrate the frequency dependence of @xmath120 we introduce dimensionless parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and choose their representative values as @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "also , we fix the value of the parameter @xmath73 at @xmath125 and rescale the frequencies as @xmath126 . in all numerical calculations we furthermore set @xmath127  =  const . , i.e. , we ignore the non - critical temperature dependence of the relaxation time",
    ". we can then evaluate the spectral function @xmath128 which is related to the raman scattering intensity . here the imaginary part of the response ( [ cq ] ) is defined by @xmath129 . in fig .  1",

    "far from @xmath77 , the spectrum is characterized by a single peak , the position of which moves towards zero frequency as @xmath132 in accordance with the expected soft - mode behavior .",
    "the hybrid soft - mode frequency approximately corresponds to the position of the peak in @xmath130 . to obtain an unambiguous definition",
    "it is necessary to consider the complex poles of the response function ( [ chi ] ) . after introducing a new variable @xmath133",
    ", the denominator takes the standard form of a cubic polynomial with real coefficients @xmath134 the complex zeros @xmath135 , @xmath136 , are given by the cardano formula .",
    "the corresponding analytic expressions for @xmath135 are cumbersome , but can easily be evaluated numerically .",
    "they then lead to three complex frequencies @xmath137 having the following properties : ( i ) one of the frequencies is always imaginary , say , @xmath138 ; ( ii ) the remaining two solutions are , in general , complex and such that always @xmath139 ; ( iii ) if @xmath140 , then @xmath141 , however , for @xmath142 we have @xmath143 ; ( iv ) in general , @xmath144 , and ( v ) @xmath145 .",
    "the response ( [ cq ] ) thus becomes @xmath146 where @xmath147 and the resonance frequency @xmath148 is given by @xmath149 while the damping parameter is @xmath150 the term @xmath151 formally appearing in the product @xmath152 is zero in view of the properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) above .",
    "it further follows from ( iv ) that @xmath153 , whereas from ( v ) we obtain a relation between @xmath148 and @xmath154 , namely , @xmath155 we can now rewrite the spectral function ( [ iom ] ) in the form @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",

    "it should be noted , however , that because of the @xmath159 term in the numerator the last expression deviates from the standard spectral function for the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath159 term partially compensates the contribution of the relaxational term in eq .",
    "( [ iomr ] ) , so that a separate central peak can not be discerned at temperatures of interest , as it is evident from fig .  1 .    in fig .  2 , we plot @xmath160 as a function of temperature with the same parameter values as in fig .  1 .",

    ", we formally have @xmath180 and the system becomes unstable . in principle , it should be stabilized by including anharmonic terms into the phonon hamiltonian ( [ hph ] ) as well as a coupling to elastic strains .    for @xmath170 , @xmath181 is always nonzero and strictly speaking the hybrid soft - mode concept",
    "is not applicable in that case . the corresponding limiting value of the instability temperature corresponding to the representative parameter values used in numerical calculations here is @xmath182 .",
    "this is a fairly large value , suggesting that any real system is likely to be in the soft - mode regime @xmath183 .",
    "to determine the type of the phase trasition occurring at @xmath184 , we introduce the order parameter as the thermal average of the ti pseudospin variable @xmath185 , which is related to @xmath186 through eq .",

    "( [ af ] ) , the first denominator vanishes as @xmath132 , while in the same limit the last factor approaches the value @xmath191 .",
    "( [ cy ] ) is reminiscent of the lyddane - sachs - teller relation for the static dielectric response .",
    "it follows that the coefficient of the quadratic term in @xmath192 vanishes at @xmath77 as @xmath193 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath194 and @xmath195 can easily be determined within a molecular field approximation , however , it turns out that this approximation would predict a second order phase transition , in disagreement with observations in batio@xmath0 . to derive the correct value of the coefficient @xmath194 in the free energy we would have to include , for example , a coupling between the soft mode and elastic strain @xcite , or equivalently , between the strain and the ti pseudospin variable .",
    "the appearance of a nonzero value of the order parameter will thus be accompanied by a macroscopic deformation of the lattice with tetragonal symmetry . in practice , @xmath194 and @xmath195",
    "are often considered as phenomenological parameters .",
    "hatta and ikushima @xcite applied an expression of the above form to analyze the measured heat capacity of batio@xmath0 at constant electric field .",
    "they used the value @xmath196 k ( in our notation ) and found that @xmath197 and @xmath198 , implying a first order phase transition which takes place at @xmath199 k ( or at @xmath200 k , depending on the sample preparation method ) .",
    "they also determined the jump in the heat capacity at @xmath201 of the order @xmath202 k , from which it was concluded that the ti ion lies in a single minimum potential , in apparent disagreement with the off - center ti picture . according to the present model",
    "the number of equilibrium positions of ti is greater than one , but their actual number is only relevant for the definition of the ti pseudospin variables . if we restrict the discussion to the adiabatic hamiltonian ( [ had ] ) , the phase transition appears to be of order - disorder type .",
    "however , the above approach involving hybrid soft - mode dynamics  which leads to the same critical temperature as the static approach  clearly has the characteristics of a displacive transition , but with a simultaneous ordering of the ti subsystem as an additional order - disorder feature .",
    "evidence of a to soft mode with @xmath2 symmetry in batio@xmath0 has been found by vogt et al .",
    "@xcite using the hyper - raman scattering technique .",
    "the dielectric function has been fitted by a classical single oscillator dispersion formula , which is equivalent to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ iomr ] ) without the @xmath203-term in the numerator .",
    "one of the important results of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the frequency of the soft mode tends to zero close to the transition temperature and no saturation of the frequency at a finite value reported earlier occurs @xcite , in agreement with the predictions of the present model .",
    "close to @xmath77 , the temperature dependence of the soft - mode frequency can be described by the relation ( [ om2 t ] ) with @xmath204 s@xmath205k@xmath206 .",
    "the relative damping constant @xmath207 was found to exceed the value of 2 at all temperatures , whereas in the present model this is true only close to @xmath77 .",
    "it has been shown by nmr methods @xcite that in the high temperature phase of batio@xmath0 the unit cells are tetragonally distorted , although the overall macroscopic symmetry is cubic .",
    "this agrees with wada et al .",
    "@xcite who determined the symmetry by raman scattering and found that the _ microscopic _ symmetry was p4 mm both above and below @xmath77 . since the orientation of the tetragonal axis varies across the crystal , the _ macroscopic _ symmetry is pm3 m above the transition and p4 mm below @xmath201",
    ". this can be accounted for by the present model if we return to the ti - ti coupling terms ( [ hdir ] ) and ( [ kij ] ) , and allow for off - diagonal interactions with @xmath62 .",
    "this then gives rise to extra terms the equations of motion ( [ eqm ] ) for @xmath208 , e.g. , @xmath209 on the time scale of the to soft mode and of the ti relaxational mode @xmath210 the variables @xmath211 are much slower and appear to be `` frozen '' in a given configuration .",
    "thus the sum over @xmath43 will play the role of a random variable @xmath212 analogous to the random electric field in dipolar glasses . instead of spatial randomness , however , we are dealing here with a temporal disorder , which appears to be `` quenched '' on the time scale of @xmath213 .",
    "this field will give rise to a slowly varying deformation of @xmath214 symmetry , which is experimentally observable in both nmr and raman experiments .",
    "since the orientation of the deformation axis @xmath31 varies both in space and time , the average symmetry of the system remains cubic .",
    "recent experiments provided new evidence that the ti ion in the cubic phase of batio@xmath0 @xcite and other oxide ferroelectrics @xcite occupies one of the eight off - center positions in the unit cell along the @xmath1 $ ] directions .",
    "we have presented a simple mesoscopic model of batio@xmath0 , assuming that the symmetrized occupational probabilities for the ti sites or pseudospins are linearly coupled with the normal coordinates of lattice vibrations . on the time scale of ti intersite jumps , lattice modes act as fast variables , which can adapt instantaneously to any change of the pseudospin configuration . in this adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the pseudospin - phonon coupling gives rise to a static phonon mediated effective ti - ti interaction .",
    "the ti subsystem thus undergoes an order - disorder transition into a polarized state of @xmath2 symmetry , and the critical temperature @xmath77 is determined by a sum of the contributions from the direct ti - ti coupling and the pseudospin - lattice part .",
    "the leading contribution is due to the to soft mode , the frequency of which tends to zero at the instability temperature @xmath32 . in general , @xmath167 , where the shift of @xmath77 depends both on the direct interaction as well as the pseudospin - phonon coupling .",
    "close to the stability limit for he to soft mode , the time scales for the ti and lattice motion become comparable and a dynamic treatment becomes necessary . by combining the classical langevin equations of motion for the relaxation of the ti pseudospins and the quantum heisenberg equations for the to soft mode coordinate , we have obtained the response of the system to an oscillating electric field , typically in an optical scattering experiment .",
    "the spectral function of this response consists of a central peak and a resonance , belonging to a new hybrid soft mode with @xmath2 symmetry , which describes the in - phase motion of the to soft optic mode and the relaxational decay of the symmetrized ti pseudospin variable .",
    "the frequency of the hybrid soft mode tends to zero at the static critical temperature @xmath77 .",
    "the central peak component is determined by the relaxational motion of the ti subsystem and can be regarded as a typical order - disorder feature of the total response , in contrast to the resonance which shows a mixed displacive and order - disorder character .",
    "the to soft mode in batio@xmath0 has been observed experimentally by hyper - raman scattering @xcite , and has been described by a damped harmonic oscillator , similar to our resonance term in the dynamic response .",
    "the soft mode frequency was found to extrapolate to zero close to the thermodynamic transition temperature @xmath201 .",
    "the frequency of the hybrid soft mode depends on the ti - phonon coupling strength and exists only in a finite interval @xmath183 , where the value of @xmath162 depends on the model parameters . outside this interval ,",
    "the soft mode concept is not applicable , however , the static response always diverges at @xmath77 .    to calculate the free energy of the system we would have to include a coupling between the soft mode and lattice strains into the model",
    "this can be done in a phenomenological approach @xcite , which describes the first order phase transition from the high temperature phase with macroscopic cubic symmetry to a tetragonal low temperature phase .",
    "the corresponding curie temperature @xmath215 is generally higher than the instability temperature @xmath77 associated with the condensation of the hybrid soft mode .",

    "<S> it has been recently established by nmr techniques that in the high temperature cubic phase of batio@xmath0 the ti ions are not confined to the high symmetry cubic sites , but rather occupy one of the eight off - center positions along the @xmath1 $ ] directions . </S>",
    "<S> the off - center ti picture is in apparent contrast with most soft - mode type theoretical descriptions of this classical perovskite ferroelectric . here </S>",
    "<S> we apply a mesoscopic model of batio@xmath0 , assuming that the symmetrized occupation operators for the ti off - center sites are linearly coupled to the normal coordinates for lattice vibrations . on the time scale of ti intersite jumps , </S>",
    "<S> most phonon modes are fast and thus merely contribute to an effective static ti - ti interaction . </S>",
    "<S> close to the stability limit for the soft to optic modes , however , the phonon time scale becomes comparable to the relaxation time for the ti occupational states of @xmath2 symmetry , and a hybrid vibrational - orientational soft mode appears . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the hybrid soft mode is calculated as a function of temperature and coupling strength , and its its role in the ferroelectric phase transition is discussed . </S>"
