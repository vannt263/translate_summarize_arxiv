    "in order to avoid excessive overlap with the many introductions that already exist in different places of this volume , we shall elaborate on a very subjective motivation of studying interquark potentials in qcd , centred around the general theme of _ building bridges _ between models and qcd .",
    "qcd contains two related , non - perturbative features : the breaking of ( approximate ) chiral symmetry and the ( effective ) confinement of coloured objects such as quarks and gluons .",
    "similarly , models of the qcd vacuum can roughly be divided into two classes : those that are primarily based on chiral symmetry and those that have confinement , for instance in the form of a confining potential , as their starting point .",
    "often it is difficult to _ microscopically _ relate a particular model to qcd .",
    "for example , should the instantons that are evidenced in lattice simulations within a given prescription at a finite cut - off , be the same that are supposed to appear within instanton liquid models ?",
    "the answer to this question is not known .    there",
    "exist , however , two ways of systematically _ building bridges_. perhaps the most obvious one is the comparison of _ global _ properties like form factors , charge distributions in position space , potential energies or particle masses . such a comparison circumvents the problem of identifying a one - to - one mapping of the degrees of freedom within a given model , which often might not qualify as a quantum field theory , onto objects that appear in the qcd vacuum .",
    "the model would then very much resemble the pragmatic use of analogies in the popular science literature : it is not that important to get things 100  % right if we can not understand them 100  % anyway .",
    "a lot of purpose - engineered qcd information that is not directly accessible to experiment can be _ manufactured _ in lattice simulations .",
    "moreover , in experiment there is only one world . on the lattice one has the freedom to vary the number of sea quark flavours @xmath1 , the quark masses , the number of gauge group colours , @xmath2 , the volume _ etc .",
    "_ , away from the values that happen to be realized in nature for one reason or another .",
    "sometimes ( like in the case of quark masses ) this is at present a necessity , in other cases it is pure virtue . in having not only one _ physical world _",
    "but many _ virtual worlds _ at ones disposal , the applicability range and precision to be expected from any model can , in principle , be tested very stringently .",
    "unfortunately , in practice , such interaction between lattice practitioners and model builders is still rather under - developed for various psychological , communication - related and dogmatic reasons and , in some cases , even out of fear , mistrust or over - confidence , one might speculate .",
    "the other way of _ building bridges _ is when a separation of scales occurs , in which the symmetries of qcd constrain the number of possible terms and allow for the systematic construction of an effective field theory .",
    "the most prominent examples are the chiral effective field theory ( @xmath3eft ) that governs the low energy interactions of qcd as well as heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) for heavy quark physics . while in @xmath3eft",
    "the scale separation occurs through the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry by some collective gluonic effect , in hqet and nrqcd the scale separation is provided by the heavy quark mass @xmath4 .",
    "ideally , one would calculate the `` high '' energy wilson coefficients of @xmath3eft , such as the pion decay constant @xmath5 , in lattice simulations ( or determine them from fits to experimental data ) .",
    "the low energy expansion , as a function of @xmath6 , can be determined analytically ( chiral perturbation theory ) . on the other hand , in hqet and nrqcd the low energy matrix elements can be provided by non - perturbative lattice simulations while the wilson coefficients are calculable in perturbation theory , as long as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes a typical non - perturbative scale of order 400  mev .",
    "it is this latter heavy quark limit , in which the static qcd potentials that are discussed here  as well as in chapter  4  can be related to mesonic bound states and , in the case of three body potentials , baryonic bound states . in doing this",
    ", qcd can be reduced to non - relativistic quantum mechanics within this particular sector , with the help of reasonable assumptions which themselves can be tested in lattice simulations .",
    "for example , in the case of quarkonia , qcd itself tells us what `` potential model '' we have to choose .",
    "it is also possible to fit the spectra of light mesons and baryons , assuming phenomenological potentials .",
    "these potentials can not be related in a systematic way either to qcd or to static potentials as calculated from wilson loops . however , in spite of some rather dubious assumptions that are implicitly folded into such non - relativistic or relativized quark - potential models , it can still be instructive to compare the parametrizations that are commonly used in this context with those that are relevant in quarkonium physics . after all",
    ", most _ physics _ appears to interpolate smoothly between hadrons made out of light and heavy quarks .",
    "there also appears to be an intimate connection between , on one hand , the broken chiral symmetry that is most relevant in the light hadronic sector  but plays little direct rle for quarkonia with masses much larger than the chiral symmetry breaking scale  and , on the other hand , the confining potential and flux tubes that seem to be the vacuum excitations that are responsible for interactions between the slowly moving heavy quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the very definition of a `` potential '' requires the concept of `` instantaneous '' interactions : a test particle has to interact with the field induced by a source on a time scale short enough to guarantee that the relative distance remains unaffected . whenever the relative speed of the two particles becomes relativistic ,",
    "the underlying assumption of a constant time difference between cause and effect is obviously violated : only in non - relativistic systems , _",
    "i.e. _  as long as the typical interaction energies ( @xmath9 ) within bound states are small compared to the particle masses ( @xmath10 ) , can we define a potential as a function of coordinates such as the distance @xmath11 , the spin @xmath12 , angular momentum @xmath13 and relative momentum @xmath14 .",
    "while for interactions between elementary charges in qed this is always the case as @xmath15 , qcd implies typical binding energies of order 400  mev and only the bottom , and eventually the charm quark , can be regarded as non - relativistic .",
    "another example in which the non - relativistic approximation is justified are nucleon - nucleon potentials , @xmath16 . although there exist attempts to extract this information also from qcd , by employing lattice simulations ( cf .",
    "chapter  4 subsec .",
    "4.4.2 ) , it is fair to predict that quantitatively reliable information , using the presently available methodology , might not become available within this decade .",
    "however , in this case a wealth of phenomenological information exists from experiment . for the quark - antiquark potential",
    "it is exactly the opposite .",
    "all experimental information is model dependent and rather indirect as quarks never appear as free particles in nature .",
    "however , this potential is among the most precisely determined quantities that have been calculated so far on the lattice    as a starting point one can make the test charges infinitely heavy , prohibiting any change in their relative speed and study the `` static '' limit . to this end",
    "we shall introduce the wegner - wilson loop and derive its relation to the static potential .",
    "subsequently , expectations of this potential from exact considerations , strong coupling and string arguments as well as from perturbation theory are presented .",
    "lattice results are then reviewed .",
    "finally , the model is extended to non - static quarks and the form of the resultant potential in coordinate space is compared with its counterpart ( @xmath17-meson exchange ) in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we will derive the relationship between the expectation values of wegner - wilson loops and the potential energy @xmath18 between two colour charges , separated by a distance @xmath11 .",
    "this is a technical but instructive exercise .",
    "the final result is displayed in eq .",
    "[ eq : specw ] .",
    "the wegner - wilson loop was originally introduced by wegner  @xcite as an order parameter in @xmath19 gauge theory .",
    "it is defined as the trace of the product of gauge variables @xmath20 along a closed oriented contour @xmath21 , enclosing @xmath22\\right\\}= \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\prod_{(x,\\mu)\\in\\delta c}u_{x,\\mu}\\right).\\ ] ] while the loop , determined on a gauge configuration a gauge group element , pointing into direction @xmath23 , located between positions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lattice spacing and @xmath24 is a lattice point within the ( finite ) 4-volume . ]",
    "@xmath27 , is in general complex , its expectation value is real , due to charge invariance : in euclidean space we have @xmath28 .",
    "it is straight forward to generalise the above wilson loop to any non - fundamental representation @xmath29 of the gauge field , just by replacing the variables @xmath20 with the corresponding links @xmath30 .",
    "the arguments below , relating the wilson loop to the potential energy of static sources , go through independent of the representation according to which the sources transform under local gauge transformations .",
    "in what follows , we will denote a wilson loop , enclosing a rectangular contour with one purely spatial distance , @xmath31 , and one temporal separation , @xmath32 , by @xmath33 .",
    "examples of wilson loops on a lattice for two different choices of contours @xmath21 are displayed in figure  [ figwilson ] .      in wilson",
    "s original work  @xcite , the wilson loop had been related to the potential energy of a pair of static colour sources by using transfer matrix arguments .",
    "however , it took a few years until brown and weisberger attempted to derive the connection between the wilson loop and the effective potential between heavy , not necessarily static , quarks in a mesonic bound state  @xcite .",
    "later on , mass dependent corrections to the static potential have been derived along similar lines  @xcite and the approach has been made systematic within the framework of efts  @xcite . in sec .",

    "the reason why the form of @xmath236 is so complicated compared with that so far discussed for @xmath237 , _",
    "i.e. _ essentially @xmath239 , is because the latter is the interaction between two _",
    "static _ quarks .",
    "if , however , we go away from this limit , then immediately the spins of the quarks begin to play a rle resulting in forms similar to those encountered in @xmath236 . these potentials should be reliable for describing @xmath240 and @xmath241 states , since the @xmath242 and @xmath243 quarks are still sufficiently heavy ( @xmath244 and 1.2 gev respectively ) to not require a relativistic treatment .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath245 quarks are involved , relativistic effects become important and even the whole concept of an interquark potential should be questioned .",
    "furthermore , , the hope that this potential between _ two _ quarks can account for multiquark systems has yet to be justified .",

    "what is the form of @xmath237 ? to this question there is no unique answer , since  as with meson - exchange models of @xmath236  forms depend on the theory from which the potential is derived and in which it should be utilized .",
    "a good example of this ambiguity is the momentum dependence of the potential . even though the correct relativistic scattering equation for two quarks is the bethe - salpeter equation , for practical reasons , this needs to be simplified to , say , the semi - relativistic blankenbecler  sugar or non - relativistic schrdinger equations  see subsec .",
    "5.1.2.2 of chapter  5 for a very brief discussion of this .",
    "if the basic blankenbecler - sugar equation is used directly then the appropriate potential contains relativistic factors of the form @xmath246 , where @xmath14 is the momentum of the quark with mass @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is often convenient to expand these momentum factors in powers of @xmath247 resulting in a potential appropriate for a lippmann  schwinger or schrdinger approach .    just as the interaction between two static quarks contained two distinct parts  _ i.e. _ the gluon exchange term @xmath248 and the confining term @xmath249",

    "it should be added that it is convenient to have @xmath254 in coordinate space , since it is hard to deal with the linearly rising term @xmath258 from @xmath255 in momentum space .",
    "in addition to this ambiguity there are three others that enter in practice :    1 .",
    "a crucial term in eq.[eq : ch1.vg ] is the hyperfine interaction proportional to @xmath259 , which splits the energies of pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "however , it is seen that it is proportional to @xmath260  a radial form that needs to be regulated before it can be used in a wave - equation .",
    "this can be accomplished in a variety of ways , of which the most simple is to make the replacement @xmath261 as was done in the original work of godfrey and isgur  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to consider this term as an effective interaction that is added in first order perturbation theory using those wavefunctions generated by the rest of @xmath237 . in this case",
