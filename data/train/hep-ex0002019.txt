    "oscillatory transitions among neutrinos of different flavors have emerged as a major topic of particle physics @xcite .",

    "a consistent , albeit less significant , signal was also observed in the cp - conjugate channel @xmath5  using muon neutrinos from @xmath20 decay in flight @xcite . when combined with the upper limits imposed by other accelerator and reactor experiments @xcite",
    ", the lsnd data suggest that the @xmath18  oscillation is driven by a mass difference squared , @xmath21 , between some 0.3 and 2.3 ev@xmath7 .",
    "the transitions @xmath18  and @xmath5  in this region of @xmath21 will soon be explored with higher sensitivity by the boone experiment at fermilab @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , an analogy with the quark sector suggests that ( i ) the @xmath22 should pick the largest contribution of the heaviest mass state @xmath23 , and that ( ii ) the mixings between the neighboring neutrino flavors ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) should be the strongest .",
    "therefore , a mass difference as large as @xmath6 ev@xmath7 should primarily manifest itself in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the existing upper limits on the effective mixing @xmath26 for the transition",
    "@xmath4  @xcite largely come from experiments with small effective baselines of @xmath27 km / gev , and therefore are much less compelling for @xmath6 ev@xmath7 than for larger values of the mass difference .    at neutrino energies well below the @xmath0 threshold ( @xmath28 gev )",
    ", the transition @xmath4  in the required region @xmath29 km / gev will be indirectly probed by boone through @xmath2 disappearance @xcite . however",
    ", a convincing @xmath4  signal can only be demonstrated by detecting the cc collisions of the @xmath22 in appearance mode .",
    "for this , an appropriate environment is offered by the `` medium - baseline '' location on mount jura @xcite in the @xmath2 beam of cern - sps ( @xmath30 km and @xmath31 gev by flux ) .",
    "the cc collisions of the @xmath22 may be identified either topologically @xcite or by detecting the detached vertex of the produced @xmath0 in a hybrid - emulsion spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the latter option is considered in this paper .",
    "for the `` original '' transition @xmath5  to be observed and investigated in the same experiment , that will have very different systematics compared to either lsnd @xcite and boone @xcite , secondary electrons must be efficiently detected and momentum - analyzed .",
    "the atmospheric evidence for neutrino oscillations driven by a mass difference of 10@xmath3210@xmath10 ev@xmath7 @xcite will be initially probed by the long - baseline experiments operating in the neutrino beams of proton accelerators @xcite .",
    "large angular divergences of these beams dictate that , for the sake of statistics , fine instrumentation of the detector and/or the magnetic analysis be compromised for a multi - kiloton fiducial mass",
    ". therefore , unraveling the pattern of oscillations in this mass region will probably require a much more intense beam generated by a muon storage ring with a straight section that points towards the detector @xcite .",
    "assuming a @xmath33 ring , the beam fully consists of muon neutrinos and electron antineutrinos whose energy spectra and angular spreads are precisely known .",
    "that the original beam contains neither @xmath34 nor @xmath35 allows to identify the parent neutrino by the sign of the lepton produced by the oscillated neutrino : negative and positive leptons are unambiguous signatures of the @xmath2 and @xmath36 parents , respectively .",
    "therefore , the transitions @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  can be tagged independently .",
    "the unique properties of this neutrino beam may warrant a finely instrumented detector of relatively small mass , that would be sensitive to a broad range of neutrino transitions driven by a mass difference of 10@xmath3210@xmath10 ev@xmath7 . for this , several conditions are obligatory . selecting the @xmath22 and @xmath39 collisions by the detached vertex of the @xmath0 is only possible in a hybrid - emulsion apparatus . in order to suppress the background to @xmath0 decays arising from anticharm production in cc collisions of the @xmath36",
    ", the detector should identify the electrons as reliably as the muons .",
    "for the transitions @xmath4and @xmath38  to be reliably discriminated , all charged secondaries ( and not just muons ) should be sign - selected and momentum - analyzed in the detector .",
    "the latter will also allow extra kinematic handles for further suppressing the background to @xmath0 decays ( such as @xmath40  of a decay particle with respect to @xmath0 direction and transverse disbalance of the event as a whole with respect to incident neutrino ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a conceptual scheme of a hybrid - emulsion spectrometer for detecting and identifying the neutrinos of different flavors by their cc collisions , as required for probing various channels of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the design emphasizes detection of @xmath0 leptons by detached vertices , reliable identification and sign - selection of electrons , good spectrometry for all charged secondaries , and reconstruction of secondary photons and @xmath41 mesons .",
    "we also estimate the performance of the proposed apparatus in a medium - baseline experiment using the neutrino beam of the proton machine cern - sps and in a long - baseline experiment in the neutrino beam of a muon storage ring .",
    "building on the ideas put forth by a. ereditato , k. niwa , and p. strolin @xcite , we implement the principle of `` emulsion cloud chamber '' : layers of thin emulsion are only used as a tracker for events occurring in passive material .",
    "but in contrast with @xcite , we aim at constructing a distributed target with low density and large radiation length @xcite , so that either muons , hadrons , and electrons can be momentum - analyzed by curvature inside the target itself .",
    "accordingly , the target should largely consist of low - z material like aluminum or carbon in the form of carbon - fiber composite . apart from narrow gaps instrumented with drift chambers that provide an electronic `` blueprint '' of the event ,",
    "the target is built as a compact homogeneous volume in ambient magnetic field .",
    "owing to relatively weak multiple scattering in low - z material , the successive layers of thin emulsion may act as an `` emulsion spectrometer '' for analyzing the momenta of charged secondaries by curvature in magnetic field . in untangling the topologies of neutrino events",
    ", the detector will operate very much like a bubble chamber .",
    "the proposed apparatus is therefore referred to as the emulsion bubble chamber , or ebc .",
    "specified below is a tentative structure of the distributed target that has been assumed in our simulations of detector response .",
    "( the actual design , including the choice of low - z material , must of course be carefully optimized for a particular experiment ) .",
    "the fine structure of the target is depicted in fig .",
    "[ structure ] . the 6-mm - thick basic element of the structure is formed by a 1-mm plate of passive material , by an emulsion  plastic  emulsion sheet ( referred to as the es ) with total thickness of 0.2 mm , and by a relatively large drift space of 4.8 mm in which @xmath0 decays are selected . in our tentative design ,",
    "the passive plate is largely carbon ( 960 @xmath42 m ) , but also includes a thin layer of denser substance ( 40 @xmath42 m of copper ) in order to boost the geometric acceptance .",
    "the es is a 100-@xmath42 m sheet of transparent plastic coated on both sides with 50-@xmath42 m layers of emulsion .",
    "the medium formed by successive elements has mean density of @xmath43 g/@xmath44 and effective radiation length of @xmath45 cm .",
    "( these values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are very similar to those of a bubble chamber with neon - hydrogen filling @xcite . )",
    "note that the element does not feature the second es downstream of the gap , as originally foreseen in @xcite : the idea is to detect the kink or the trident using track segments in the ess of two successive elements , as allowed by relatively weak coulomb scattering in low - z material of the intervening passive plate .    on the technical side ,",
    "the air gap can be created by thin and rigid `` bristles '' on the upstream face of the carbon - composite plate that has been manufactured in `` brush - like '' form .",
    "( this is only possible because we have just one es per element . )",
    "the positions of the thin bristles will be tabulated , and secondary vertices that match these positions will be dropped .",
    "another technical option for the drift space is 5-mm - thick paper honeycomb .    for a @xmath0 that emerged from the passive plate and suffered a one - prong or a three - prong decay in the gap",
    ", the decay vertex can be reconstructed from the track segments in two successive ess . as soon as the fitted secondary vertex lies within the intervening passive plate , the candidate event",
    "must be dropped because of the high background from reinteractions . in principle , a @xmath0 that decayed before reaching the gap can be detected by impact parameter , but this possibility is not considered here . by adding a thin layer of denser material ( copper ) downstream of low - z material ( carbon ) , we slightly compromise the radiation length for geometric acceptance : thereby , the fraction of @xmath0 leptons that reach the air gap is effectively increased . that the proportion of copper events is boosted by the geometric effect is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ vertices ] . here and below",
    ", the spectrum of incident @xmath0 neutrinos is assumed to be proportional to the spectrum of muon neutrinos from cern - sps @xcite .    for the tracks to be found in emulsion at scanning stage",
    ", planes of electronic detectors must be inserted in the continuous structure formed by the basic elements .",
    "these detectors should allow a crude on - line reconstruction of the event as a whole , and therefore they must have sufficient spatial resolution , provide angular information , and be spaced by less than one radiation length @xmath47 . in our tentative design",
    ", a stack of 30 elements forms a `` module '' with total thickness of @xmath48 , and 4-cm - wide gaps between adjacent modules are instrumented by multisampling drift chambers .    in a medium- or long - baseline experiment where the occupancy of ess will be relatively low",
    ", the accuracy of `` electronic '' reconstruction should be sufficient for unambiguously finding an energetic track in emulsion .",
    "therefore , one can scan back along a stiff track , starting from the downstream es of the module in which the collision occurred . as soon as the layer of origin",
    "is reached , a few successive ess of the nearby elements must be fully scanned over relatively small areas towards finding the stubs of all other tracks associated with the primary vertex . to refine the alignment of ess ,",
    "a sufficient number of stiff muon tracks must be fully reconstructed in emulsion .",
    "this first stage of emulsion scanning will yield a relatively small number of events featuring decay signatures ( either a kink or a trident in the air gap just downstream of the primary vertex ) .",
    "the second stage will be to scan down all tracks emerging from the primary vertex and to find and measure the conversions of secondary photons in the distributed target .",
    "this will allow to analyze the momenta of the secondaries in the `` emulsion spectrometer '' and to identify electrons by change of curvature and by emission of brems .",
    "we foresee that the scanning of emulsion will only start after the full period of detector exposure .",
    "the response of the ebc detector is simulated using geant . in fitting a track",
    ", we assume that each tracker traversed ( either a es or a drift chamber ) provides two spatial points with resolutions of 2 and 150 @xmath42 m , respectively .",
    "because of multiple scattering , the fit is but marginally sensitive to increasing the spatial error in the es from 2 up to 8 @xmath42 m .",
    "a uniform magnetic field of 0.7 tesla , that is normal with respect to beam direction , is assumed throughout .",
    "( using a stronger field would boost the performance of the spectrometer , but may be impracticable for a big air - core magnet that will house a multiton ebc . )    when found in emulsion , the track of an electron can be identified by a variation of curvature due to energy losses in successive layers of the target .",
    "these losses must be accounted for in estimating the momentum by curvature in magnetic field . for this",
    ", we use a simple algorithm that should be treated as preliminary and is not fully realistic .",
    "namely , we fit a restricted segment of the @xmath49 track over which the actual loss of energy does not exceed 30% .",
    "additionally , this segment is required to cross no less than five ess .",
    "we compute an `` ideal trajectory '' for a given value of electron momentum @xmath50 , to which the observed trajectory is then fitted , using geant .",
    "in doing so , we switch off multiple scattering and radiation losses , but instead reduce the momentum `` by hand '' in each layer of the target by the same amount @xmath51 that is treated as an empirical parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is selected",
    "so as to obtain ( i ) an unbiased estimate of electron momentum ( @xmath52 ) and ( ii ) a reasonable value of @xmath53 .    for definiteness",
    ", we use a monte - carlo template of electrons with @xmath54 gev originating from simulated decays @xmath1  ( see further ) . for these electrons ,",
    "the mean length of the selected track segment is close to 30 cm ( see fig .",
    "[ length ] ) , which proves to be sufficient for analyzing the momentum in the `` emulsion spectrometer '' formed by successive ess of the distributed target . plotted in fig .",
    "[ aluminum ] is the ratio between the fitted and true momenta , @xmath55 , for the properly fitted electrons ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the same ratio is then separately shown for two regions of electron momentum : @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 gev .",
    "we estimate that of all electrons with @xmath54 gev , nearly 90% can be reliably detected , identified , and sign - selected ( that is , reconstructed with @xmath56 and @xmath59 ) . on average , the @xmath49 momentum is measured to a precision of some 11% .    treating the length of the track segment as a free parameter of the fit , which is a more realistic approach that is not attempted in this paper ,",
    "will further improve the momentum resolution and boost the fraction of sign - selected electrons .",
    "good spectrometry for electrons will allow ebc to detect and discriminate the cc collisions of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos and , at the same time , to select electronic decays of the @xmath0 almost as efficiently as the muonic ones .",
    "a comparison between the two leptonic modes will provide an important handle on self - consistency of any @xmath0 signal .",
    "the spectrometry of muons and charged pions is much less affected by energy loss in matter , but for pions the momentum resolution is slightly degraded by hadronic reinteractions . for the pions with @xmath60 gev originating from",
    "the simulated decays @xmath61 , fig .",

    "( here , we assume that the potential length in the detector is much larger than @xmath45 cm . ) in estimating the energy of a photon that has converted in the target , we count only those conversion electrons that have fired at least one drift chamber and , therefore , can be found in emulsion and then momentum - analyzed by curvature .",
    "we also assume that the primary vertex has already been fitted , so that the direction of the photon is precisely known . for illustration",

    "for the @xmath0 leptons emitted in either the deep - inelastic and quasielastic @xmath65 collisions , we generate the two leptonic decays , @xmath66  and @xmath1 , and three semileptonic ( quasi-)two - body decays : @xmath61 , @xmath63  that is mediated by the resonance _",
