    "in this paper we discuss the dynamics of a relativistic string in constant curvature spacetimes , using a combination of geometrical methods and physical insight .",
    "the kind of problems we are interested in here and the way of reasoning , historically had the origin in investigations of the motion of vortices in a superfluid @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the latter problem , which is equivalent to a theory of dual strings interacting in a particular way through a scalar field @xcite , reduces to solving two coupled non - linear partial differential equations , one of which being a generalized sine - gordon equation .",
    "it was soon realized that exactly the same equations appear when considering a two - dimensional sigma model corresponding to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this model , on the other hand , describes a relativistic string in a ( euclidean signature ) constant curvature space .",
    "for the theory of fundamental strings , it is important to consider formulations in curved spacetimes also , essentially as descriptions of one string in the background created by the others .",
    "the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are generally highly non - linear in any gauge , which in most cases means that the system is non - integrable .",
    "exceptional cases are , among others , strings in maximally symmetric spacetimes @xcite . from the physical point of view",
    ", de sitter spacetime plays a particular role in this family of spacetimes , since it describes an inflationary universe .",
    "string theory in de sitter spacetime is therefore also of interest from the point of view of cosmic strings and cosmology and for the open question of string self - sustained inflation @xcite .",
    "specific problems concerning the integrability of the equations describing the dynamics of classical strings in de sitter spacetime were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the present work is a completion and generalization of the results presented in those papers .    in section 2",
    "we set up the general formalism for classical strings in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , and we derive the equations fulfilled by the fundamental quadratic form for a generic string configuration .",
    "the fundamental quadratic form @xmath2 is a measure of the invariant string size .",
    "we show that it solves the sinh - gordon equation , the cosh - gordon equation or the liouville equation .",
    "we find that in order to cover the generic string dynamics , _ all _ three equations must be taken into account .",
    "associated potentials ( @xmath3 ) to these equations can be respectively defined ( @xmath4-sign for anti de sitter spacetime and @xmath5-sign for de sitter spacetime )",
    ". generic properties of the string dynamics are then directly extracted at the level of the equations of motion from the properties of these potentials ( irrespective of any solution ) .",
    "the three equations correspond to three different sectors of the string dynamics ( until now only the sinh - gordon sector ( corresponding to the @xmath6 potential ) in de sitter spacetime was known ) .",
    "the differences between the three sectors in each spacetime appear mainly for small strings ( strings with proper size @xmath7    in de sitter spacetime , the sinh - gordon sector characterizes the evolution in which small strings necessarily collapse into a point , while in the cosh - gordon sector , strings never collapse but reach a minimal size . in anti de sitter spacetime ,",
    "the situation is exactly the opposite : the cosh - gordon sector characterizes the evolution in which strings necessarily collapse into a point , while in the sinh - gordon sector , strings never collapse but reach a minimal size . on the other hand , the dynamics of large strings is rather similar in the three sectors in each spacetime ( see figs .",
    "1a , 1b , for instance ) .",
    "the dynamics of small strings is rather similar in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , while for large strings ( strings with proper size @xmath8 the dynamics is drastically different in the two spacetimes . in de sitter spacetime ,",
    "the presence of potentials unbounded from below for positive @xmath9 in all three sectors , makes string instability ( indefinetely growing strings ) unavoidable ( in anti de sitter spacetime , the positive potential barriers for positive @xmath10 prevents the strings from growing indefinetely ) .",
    "in section 3 we present new classes of explicit solutions in both de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , which cover all the three sectors .",
    "these solutions exhibit the multi - string property @xcite , namely one single world - sheet describes a finite or infinite number of different and independent strings .",
    "the presence of multi - strings is a characteristic feature in spacetimes with a cosmological constant ( constant curvature or asymptotically constant curvature spacetimes ) .    in section 4 , we show that our results also hold for the @xmath0 dimensional black hole anti de sitter spacetime @xcite , and we complete earlier investigation on the dynamics of circular string configurations in this spacetime @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 5 we give our conclusions .",
    "for simplicity , the following analysis is performed for @xmath0 dimensional spacetimes . however , it is straightforward to generalize the results to arbitrary dimensions , following the lines of @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 dimensional de sitter spacetime can be obtained from flat @xmath11 spacetime : @xmath12 by restricting to the submanifold : @xmath13 where : @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the hubble constant of de sitter spacetime .",
    "similarly , we can obtain @xmath0 dimensional anti de sitter spacetime from flat @xmath17 spacetime : @xmath18 by restricting to the submanifold : @xmath19 where : @xmath20 @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the hubble constant of anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "we can thus treat de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes simultaneously by introducing the following notation .",
    "we consider a flat spacetime with line element @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 and restrict to the submanifold : @xmath24 where : @xmath25 and @xmath26 is in the form of equations ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.8 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath27 corresponds to de sitter spacetime while @xmath28 corresponds to anti de sitter spacetime .    let us now consider a bosonic string embedded in the spacetime ( 2.9 ) . in the conformal gauge , where the string world - sheet metric is diagonal , the lagrangian is given by : @xmath29 where the restriction ( 2.10 ) has been taken into account consistently , through the lagrange multiplier @xmath30 and dot and prime denote differentiation with respect to the world - sheet coordinates tau and sigma , respectively .",
    "the classical string equations of motion and constraints take then the form : @xmath31 @xmath32 the induced line element on the string world - sheet is given by : @xmath33 since we consider only timelike world - sheets , we can define a real function @xmath34 by : @xmath35 and we have introduced world - sheet light - cone coordinates @xmath36 that is to say , @xmath37 etc .    the fundamental quadratic form , @xmath38 is a measure of the invariant string size @xmath39 as follows from equations ( 2.15)-(2.16 ) : @xmath40 the string equations of motion and constraints , equations ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) , can now be written in the more compact form : @xmath41 @xmath42    from now on we follow the procedure of refs.@xcite ( see also [ 1 - 5,18 - 20 ] ) . let us consider the set of vectors : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is defined by : @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the completely anti - symmetric four - tensor in the spacetime ( 2.9 ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that the vectors in @xmath47 are linearly independent , although not orthonormal .",
    "the vector @xmath44 is normalized according to : @xmath48    the second derivatives of @xmath49 when expressed in the basis @xmath50 are given by : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are implicitly defined by : @xmath56 from these expressions we compute the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 in two different ways ( using @xmath59 from ( 2.23 ) and @xmath60 from ( 2.25 ) , as well as @xmath61 from ( 2.25 ) and @xmath62 from ( 2.24 ) ) , and it then follows that : @xmath63 then , by differentiating equation ( 2.16 ) twize , we get : @xmath64 in the previous discussions @xcite , it was implicitly assumed that the product @xmath65 is positive definite . in that case the conformal transformation on the world - sheet metric ( 2.15 ) : @xmath66 which transforms @xmath67 @xmath68 reduces equation ( 2.28 ) to the equation : @xmath69 this equation is the sinh - gordon equation in the case of de sitter spacetime @xmath70 and the cosh - gordon equation in the case of anti de sitter spacetime @xmath71    it must be noticed , however , that for a generic string world - sheet , the product @xmath65 is neither positive nor negative definite .",
    "in fact , in the next section we shall construct explicit solutions to the string equations of motion and constraints ( 2.18)-(2.19 ) corresponding to @xmath65 positive , @xmath65 negative and @xmath65 identically zero , in _ both _ de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .    in the case that @xmath65 is negative",
    ", the conformal transformation ( 2.29 ) reduces equation ( 2.28 ) to : @xmath72 and including also the case when @xmath73 we conclude that the most general equation fulfilled by the fundamental quadratic form @xmath34 is : @xmath74 where : @xmath75 and : @xmath76 equation ( 2.33 ) is either the sinh - gordon equation ( @xmath77 ) , the cosh - gordon equation ( @xmath78 ) or the liouville equation ( @xmath79 ) , and all three equations appear in both de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "this does not mean , of course , that the string dynamics is the same in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "let us define a potential @xmath80 by : @xmath81 ( so that if @xmath82 then @xmath83 const . ) .",
    "then , it follows that in the case of de sitter spacetime : @xmath84 while in the case of anti de sitter spacetime : @xmath85 and we have skipped the @xmath86-index on @xmath87 notice that to the sinh - gordon equation corresponds the @xmath6 potential and vice - versa .    the results ( 2.36)-(2.38 )",
    "are represented in fig.1 .",
    ", showing the different potentials in the cases of de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , respectively . until now only the @xmath88 sector in de sitter spacetime was known .",
    "the new features introduced by the new sectors @xmath79 ( corresponding to the liouville equation ) and @xmath89 ( corresponding to the cosh - gordon equation in the case of de sitter spacetime and to the sinh - gordon equation in the case of anti de sitter spacetime ) appear for negative @xmath10 ( `` small '' strings ) .",
    "small strings with proper size @xmath90 in the @xmath89 sector ( inside the horizon in the case of de sitter spacetime ) , do not collapse into a point ( as is the case in the @xmath88 sector ) but have a minimal size .",
    "the main differences between de sitter and anti de sitter potentials are for positive @xmath10 ( strings with proper size @xmath91 in the case of de sitter spacetime ( fig.1a . ) , the potentials are unbounded from below for large strings ( large positive @xmath10 ) , while for small strings ( large negative @xmath10 ) they are either growing indefinetely , flat or unbounded from below . in the case of anti de sitter spacetime ( fig.1b",
    ", on the other hand , the potentials grow indefinetely for large strings ( large positive @xmath10 ) , while for small strings ( large negative @xmath10 ) they are either growing indefinetely , flat or unbounded from below .",
    "from these results we can deduce the generic features of strings propagating in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes : large strings ( large positive @xmath10 ) in de sitter spacetime generically expand indefinitely , while small strings ( large negative @xmath10 ) either bounce or collapse .",
    "in anti de sitter spacetime , large strings generically contract , while small strings either bounce or collapse . for small strings ( large negative @xmath10 ) the dynamics is similar in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , while for large strings ( large positive @xmath10 ) it is completely different in the two spacetimes .",
    "notice that the @xmath92 in equation ( 2.33 ) , which distinguishes between de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , corresponds to the @xmath93 in the notation of ref.@xcite .",
    "our @xmath94 in equation ( 2.33 ) was missed in refs.@xcite ; only the solutions corresponding to @xmath88 were found there .",
    "the exact ( `` global '' , i.e. the whole world - sheet ) solutions to the string equations of motion and constraints in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes considered in the literature until now [ 12 - 15 , 17 , 21 - 23 ] , describe different classes of string solutions of generic shape , circular strings and stationary strings .",
    "these solutions exhibit the multi - string property @xcite , namely one single world - sheet describes a finite or infinite number of different and independent strings .",
    "the presence of multi - strings is a characteristic feature in spacetimes with a cosmological constant ( constant curvature or asymptotically constant curvature spacetimes ) .",
    "all these solutions fall in the @xmath88 sector , i.e. are solutions to the sinh - gordon equation in the case of de sitter spacetime and to the cosh - gordon equation in the case of anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "we shall now construct larger families of exact solutions which fall into _ all _ three sectors @xmath95    consider first the following algebraic problem : what is the most general ansatz which reduces the string equations of motion and constraints to _ ordinary _ differential equations , in spacetimes of the form : @xmath96 the string equations of motion are given by : @xmath97 while the constraints take the form : @xmath98 since the christoffel symbols depend only on @xmath99 the desired ansatz is : @xmath100 where @xmath101 are the two world - sheet coordinates ( one of which is timelike , the other spacelike ) , and @xmath102 are two arbitrary constants . with this ansatz , equations ( 3.2 )",
    "are solved by : @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 are two integration constants . for the constraints , equations ( 3.3 ) , to be fulfilled , we must have : @xmath106 in particular , circular string dynamics as considered in [ 12 - 15 , 17 , 21 , 23 ] corresponds to @xmath107 and @xmath108 while the infinitely long stationary strings considered in [ 15 ] correspond to the `` dual '' choice @xmath109 and @xmath110    the induced line element on the string world - sheet is : @xmath111,\\ ] ] such that the fundamental quadratic form is given by : @xmath112    let us now return to our main interest here : strings in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes . in this case , the function @xmath113 is given by : @xmath114 in the case of anti de sitter spacetime @xmath115 the static coordinates @xmath116 cover the complete manifold , while for de sitter spacetime @xmath70 they cover only the region inside the horizon ; the complete de sitter manifold can however be covered by four coordinate patches of the form ( 3.1 ) , ( 3.10 ) , see for instance @xcite .",
    "notice that the equation ( 3.6 ) for the radial coordinate can be solved explicitly in terms of the weierstrass elliptic @xmath117-function @xcite .",
    "the other two equations ( 3.5 ) can then be integrated ; the results being expressed in terms of the weierstrass elliptic @xmath118 and @xmath119-functions @xcite .",
    "we have thus solved completely the string equations of motion and constraints using the ansats ( 3.4 ) in both de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , but the explicit expressions of the solutions are not important here .",
    "it should be also stressed that in general the ansatz ( 3.4 ) does not lead to solutions automatically fulfilling the standard closed or open string boundary conditions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "however , imposing the boundary conditions does not arise any problem . in some cases the ansats ( 3.4 )",
    "actually _ does _ lead to solutions fulfilling the standard boundary conditions ; an example is @xmath120 in which case the solution describes dynamical circular strings [ 12 - 15 , 17 , 21 , 23 ] .",
    "finally , we are often interested in string solutions that do not fulfill the standard closed or open string boundary conditions ; this is for instance the case for infinitely long strings @xcite or finite open strings with external forces acting on the endpoints of the strings @xcite .",
    "let us consider the spacetime region where @xmath121 ( similar conclusions are reached in the other region ) . in this case @xmath122 is the timelike world - sheet coordinate , @xmath123 then , equations ( 3.6 ) , ( 3.9 ) lead to : @xmath124 e^{-\\alpha^{(\\epsilon)}}\\nonumber\\\\ = \\hspace*{-2mm}&-&\\hspace*{-2mm}\\frac{4}{h^2}(c_2 ^ 2-\\epsilon h^2 c_1 ^ 2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , by tuning the constants of motion to fix the sign of the square bracket , and by performing conformal transformations of the form ( 2.28 ) , we can , after differentiation with respect to tau , reduce this equation to either the sinh - gordon equation , the cosh - gordon equation or the liouville equation : @xmath125<0&\\;\\;\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{sinh - gordon } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\epsilon[c_1 ^ 2 c_2 ^ 2-(c_2 ^ 2+\\epsilon h^2 c_1 ^",

    "we close this section with the following remark : the ansatz ( 3.4 ) is a generalization of both the circular string ansatz ( @xmath126 timelike ) and the stationary string ansatz ( @xmath127 spacelike ) . in both these cases ,",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "[ 12 - 15 ] that the resulting solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes should be interpreted as multi - string solutions , that is to say , string solutions where one single world - sheet describes finitely or infinitely many different and independent strings .",
    "the existence of such multi - string solutions appears to be a quite general feature in constant curvature ( and asymptotically constant curvature ) spacetimes .",
    "as another example to illustrate our general results of section 2 , we now consider the @xmath0 dimensional black hole anti de sitter spacetime ( bh - ads ) .",
    "the metric of the @xmath0 dimensional bh - ads spacetime in its standard form is given by @xcite : @xmath128 where : @xmath129 here @xmath130 represents the mass , @xmath131 is the angular momentum and the cosmological constant is @xmath132 for @xmath133 there are two horizons @xmath134 @xmath135 and a static limit @xmath136 @xmath137 this spacetime has attracted a lot of interest recently ( for a review , see for instance @xcite ) , since the causal structure is similar to that of the four dimensional kerr spacetime .",
    "however , notice that there is no strong curvature singularity at @xmath138 in fact : @xmath139 that is to say , the curvature is constant everywhere and the spacetime is locally and asymptotically isometric to @xmath0 dimensional anti de sitter spacetime ; this is of course why it is also relevant for our purposes here .",
    "for more details on the local and global geometry of the bh - ads spacetime , see for instance refs .",
    "[ 16 , 30 - 32 ] .",
    "the problem of the string propagation in the bh - ads spacetime was completely analyzed and the circular string motion was exactly solved , in terms of elliptic functions , by the present authors in @xcite .",
    "the equation determining the string loop radius as a function of time is : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a non - negative integration constant , while the fundamental quadratic form @xmath9 which determines the invariant size of the string , is given by : @xmath142 it is then straightforward to show that the equation ( 4.6 ) becomes : @xmath143 after performing a conformal transformation of the form ( 2.28 ) and differentiating with respect to tau , this equation reduces to the ( i ) sinh - gordon equation if @xmath144 ( ii ) to the cosh - gordon equation if @xmath145 and ( iii ) to the liouville equation if @xmath146 thus all three equations are present .",
    "notice finally that the three different types of allowed dynamics as reported in @xcite , essentially whether the circular string collapses into @xmath147 ( case ( ii ) ) or not ( case ( i ) ) , precisely correspond to these different equations ( in the limiting case ( iii ) , the string contracts from the static limit to @xmath147 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the fundamental quadratic form of classical string propagation in @xmath0 dimensional constant curvature spacetimes solves the sinh - gordon equation , the cosh - gordon equation or the liouville equation .",
    "we have shown that in both de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes ( as well as in the @xmath0 bh - ads spacetime ) , all three equations must be included to cover the generic string dynamics .",
    "this is particularly enlightening , since generic features of the string propagation in these spacetimes can be read off directly at the level of the equations of motion from the properties of the sinh , cosh and liouville potentials , without need of solving the equations .",
    "we also constructed new classes of explicit solutions to _ all _ three equations in both de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , exhibiting the multi - string property .",
    "finally it is worth to observe that our results suggest the existence of various kinds of dualities relating the different string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes . from the potentials , eqs .",
    "( 2.36)-(2.38 ) , it follows , in particular , that small strings are dual ( @xmath148 ) to large strings in the @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) sector of de sitter ( anti de sitter )    spacetime .",
    "furthermore , small ( large ) strings in the @xmath89 sector in de sitter spacetime are dual ( @xmath149 ) to large ( small ) strings in the @xmath88 sector in anti de sitter spacetime . + the work by a.l .",
