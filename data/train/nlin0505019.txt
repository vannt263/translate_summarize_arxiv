    "the aim of this paper is to describe in detail the interrelation between specific 3-dimensional ( 3d ) and 2-dimensional ( 2d ) integrable lattice spin models . in particular",
    ", we shall make use of 3d techniques in order to derive the isospectral transformations of a 2d model , which would be difficult to find directly .",
    "the 3d model we shall exploit is the generalized zamolodchikov - bazhanov - baxter ( zbb ) model @xcite in the vertex formulation @xcite .",
    "this model describes chirally interacting @xmath2-spins placed on the links of a 3d cubic lattice",
    ". the corresponding 2d model will be the integrable bazhanov - stroganov ( bs ) model @xcite , which is related to the integrable chiral potts ( cp ) model @xcite .",
    "we shall use the approach to the generalized zbb model developed in @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables are affine weyl pairs @xmath3 which live on the links @xmath4 of an oriented 3d lattice .",
    "the cornerstone of the approach is the explicit construction of a canonical map of the triplet of weyl pairs on the three incoming links of a vertex to the weyl pair triplet on the three outgoing links .",
    "this map defines the boltzmann weights and by construction satisfies the tetrahedron equation .",
    "the canonical map is uniquely determined postulating a baxter @xmath5-invariance and a specific linear problem for the weyl variables .    the generalized zbb model with @xmath2-spins",
    "is obtained taking the weyl variables to commute to the @xmath6-th root of unity .",
    "then the weyl centers @xmath7 and @xmath8 are classical dynamical variables of a classical discrete integrable system of hirota form which is determined by the canonical mapping and boundary conditions .",
    "this system can be solved using standard tools of algebraic geometry , i.e. @xmath9 functions and fay - identities . using the rational limit of the @xmath9-functions this",
    "is handled in a practical explicit way .",
    "the weyl operators at @xmath6-th root of unity are represented by @xmath10 matrices .",
    "then the canonical mapping decomposes into a functional mapping of the centers and a finite - dimensional transformation given by @xmath11 matrix .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the matrix element of this matrix coincide with the boltzmann weights of zbb model . in this approach",
    "the zbb model appears in the special case that the functional mapping is trivial , i.e. that trivial solutions to the hirota - type equations are chosen .",
    "non - trivial solutions for the functional mapping mean non - trivial classical dynamics of the weyl centers , in particular , solitonic solutions .",
    "the final aim is to find separated variables .",
    "it is well - known that the few - layer zbb model , with quasiperiodic boundary conditions in the direction orthogonal to the layers , is related to the integrable chiral potts model .",
    "the main aim of this paper is the explicit construction of various properties of the bazhanov - stroganov quantum chain directly from the linear problem and the canonical mapping operator of the generalized zbb model .",
    "the linear problem leads to the bs @xmath0-operator .",
    "the quantum intertwining operator of the bs model is obtained as the product of two 3d canonical mapping operators . in case of the trivial functional mapping",
    "this gives the well - known bs @xmath1-matrix .",
    "however , this is generalized if non - trivial classical dynamics is taken into account .",
    "intertwining through the whole bs chain leads to isospectrality transforms of the transfer matrix .",
    "a special case of the bs model is the relativistic toda chain , for which isospectral transforms have been constructed already in @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the 3d approach to 2d problems is the flexibility regarding the choice of parametrization .",
    "the cp parametrization turns out to be less convenient for the dynamical case than a parametrization using simple cross - ratios and rational @xmath9-functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ basic ] we summarize the main features and formulae of the models considered . then in section [ bs - from-3d ] the @xmath0-operator and the quantum intertwining relation for the bs - model",
    "will be derived using the canonical mapping approach to the zbb - model .",
    "a new parametrization of the bs - intertwining matrix in terms of cross - ratios is introduced . in the following section [ class - bs ]",
    "we introduce a classical counterpart of the bs - model and find the transformation realizing the intertwining of two lax - operators , using the functional mapping of the 3d vertex zbb - model .",
    "section [ main ] starts stating the main result of the paper , the explicit formula for the isospectral transformation of the bs - model .",
    "the proof of this proposition is given in the following subsections .",
    "section [ discus ] summarizes the results .",
