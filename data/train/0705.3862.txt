    "some time ago fernndez et al @xcite developed a method for the accurate calculation of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for bound states and resonances of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this approach is based on the taylor expansion of a regularized logarithmic derivative of the eigenfunction .",
    "the physical eigenvalue is given by a sequence of roots of hankel determinants constructed from the coefficients of that series .",
    "one merit of this approach , called riccati  pad , is the great convergence rate in most cases and that the same equation applies to bound states and resonances . besides , in some cases it yields upper and lower bounds to the eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "the logarithmic derivative satisfies a riccati equation , and one may wonder if the method applies to other nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether a kind of pad  hankel method may be useful for two  point boundary value problems given by nonlinear ordinary differential equations .    in section [ sec : method ]",
    "we outline the method , in section [ sec : examples ] we apply it to several problems of physical interest , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the relative merits of the approach .",
    "it is our purpose to propose a method for the treatment of two  point boundary value problems .",
    "we suppose that the solution @xmath0 of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation can be expanded as @xmath1 about @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real numbers , and @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume that we can calculate sufficient coefficients @xmath6 in terms of one of them that should be determined by the boundary condition at the other point ; for example , at infinity .",
    "we show several illustrative examples in the following section .",
    "we try a rational approximation to @xmath7 of the form @xmath8(z)=\\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{m}a_{j}z^{j}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n}b_{j}z^{j}}. \\label{eq:[m , n]}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "the taylor expansion of the usual pad approximant yields @xmath10 coefficients of the series ( [ eq : f_series])@xcite ; but in the present case we require that the rational approximation ( [ eq:[m , n ] ] ) gives us one more coefficient , that is to say , @xmath11 . if @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , this requirement leads to the equation@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimension of the hankel determinant @xmath17 .    in general , equation ( [ eq : hankel ] )",
    "exhibits many roots and one expects to find a sequence , for @xmath18 and fixed @xmath19 , that converges towards the required value of the unknown coefficient . from now on we call it hankel sequence for short .",
    "if such convergent sequence is monotonously increasing or decreasing we assume that it yields a lower or upper bound , respectively .",
    "such bounds where proved rigorously for some eigenvalue problems@xcite .",
    "in order to test the performance of the pad  hankel method , in this section we consider the examples treated recently by boisseau et al by means of a most interesting algebraic approach@xcite .",
    "we first consider the field equation determining the vortex profile in a ginzburg ",
    "landau effective theory@xcite ( and references therein ) @xmath20 the solution @xmath21 satisfies the expansion ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "if we substitute this series into the differential equation and solve for the coefficients @xmath6 , we obtain them in terms of the only unknown @xmath25 that is determined by the boundary condition at infinity : @xmath26@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath6 , and therefore the hankel determinant @xmath27 , are polynomial functions of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , for @xmath28 we have @xmath29    tables [ tab : gln1 ] and [ tab : gln2 ] show two hankel sequences with @xmath30 and @xmath31 that converge rapidly towards the result of the accurate shooting method@xcite for @xmath28 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we appreciate that in the case @xmath28 the sequences with @xmath30 and @xmath31 give upper and lower bounds , respectively , that tightly bracket the exact value of the unknown parameter of the theory : @xmath33 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the appropriate hankel sequences are oscillatory when @xmath34 and their rate of convergence decreases with @xmath35 .",
    "table [ tab : gln2 - 4 ] shows the best estimates of @xmath25 for @xmath36 .    our second example is the fixed ",
    "point equation for wilson s exact renormalization group@xcite ( and references therein ) @xmath37 the solution to this equation can be expanded as in equation ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath24 .",

    "the hankel sequences with @xmath30 and @xmath31 converge towards the numerical result@xcite ( and references therein ) from above and below , respectively .",
    "[ fig : wilson ] displays the great rate of convergence of these sequences as @xmath42 , @xmath18 , from which we obtain the accurate bounds @xmath43    the third example comes from a suitably modified wegner ",

    "table [ tab : wh ] shows hankel sequences with @xmath30 and @xmath31 that clearly converge towards the numerical value of @xmath25@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "we have also applied our approach to the ordinary differential equation for the spherically symmetric skyrmion field@xcite ( and references therein ) but we could not obtain convergent hankel sequences .",
    "we do not know yet the reason for the failure of the method in this case .",
    "present approach has earlier proved suitable for the treatment of the riccati equation derived from the schrdinger equation@xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the following riccati equation @xmath49 the solution can be expanded as in equation ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath50 ; the first coefficients are @xmath51 there is a critical value @xmath52 of @xmath53 such that @xmath54 at large @xmath40 if @xmath55 , @xmath0 develops a singular point if @xmath56 , and @xmath57 at large @xmath40 if @xmath58 .",

    "hankel method yields the value of @xmath52 with remarkable accuracy as shown in table [ tab : riccati ] .",
    "the rate of convergence of the hankel sequence for this problem is considerably greater than for the preceding ones .    if we substitute @xmath59 into equation ( [ eq : riccati ] ) , then the function @xmath60 satisfies the schrdinger equation for a harmonic oscillator with zero energy on the half line : @xmath61 , and the problem solved above is equivalent to finding the logarithmic derivative at origin @xmath62 so that @xmath60 behaves as @xmath63 at infinity .",
    "obviously , any approach for linear differential equations is suitable for this problem .    finally , we consider the thomas  fermi equation @xcite ( and references therein ) @xmath64 that provides a semiclassical description of the charge density in atoms of high atomic number .",
    "it poses the problem of finding the slope at origin @xmath65 so that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the change of variables @xmath68 leads to a more tractable equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "we can expand the solution to this equation in a taylor series : @xmath71 and the unknown slope is given by the unknown coefficient : @xmath72 .",
    "one easily derives a recurrence relation for the coefficients of this expansion@xcite .",
    "although the treatment of equation ( [ eq : t - f - xi ] ) is straightforward , we find it more convenient to define the function @xmath73 that is a solution to @xmath74 -f(t)f^{\\prime } ( t)-2t^{2}f(t)^{3}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : t - f - f}\\ ] ] the function @xmath75 satisfies a series like ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the first coefficients are @xmath78 we expect that a hankel sequence will converge towards @xmath79 . since @xmath80 is the first nonzero coefficient that depends on @xmath81 we choose @xmath82 in the hankel determinant .",
    "table [ tab : tf ] shows that the hankel sequence with @xmath83 converges rapidly giving a most accurate value of the slope at origin @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we consider two examples discussed by bender et al@xcite ; the first of them is the instanton equation @xmath85 with the boundary conditions @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the solution to this equation is @xmath88 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath0 is a particular case of equation ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath45 ; its first coefficients being @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the unknown .",
    "the hankel series with @xmath30 and @xmath31 converge rapidly giving upper and lower bounds , respectively , to the exact result @xmath91 .",
    "the second example is the well known blasius equation@xcite @xmath92 with the boundary conditions @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the expansion of the solution in a taylor series about @xmath2 is a particular case of equation ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath95 and @xmath96 ; its first coefficients are @xmath97 since , in general , @xmath98 , then the only root of the hankel determinants is @xmath99 that leads to the trivial solution @xmath100 .",
    "we thus see another case where the pad ",
    "hankel method does not apply .",
    "we have presented a simple method for the treatment of two  point boundary value problems .",
    "if there is a suitable series for the solution about one point , we construct a hankel matrix with the expansion coefficients and obtain the physical value of the undetermined coefficient from the roots of a sequence of determinants .",
    "the value of this coefficient given by a convergent hankel sequence is exactly the one that produces the correct asymptotic behaviour at the other point .",
    "we can not prove this assumption rigorously , but it seems that if there is a convergent sequence , it yields the correct answer .",
    "moreover , in some cases the hankel sequences produce upper and lower bounds bracketing the exact result tightly .",
    "present pad ",
    "hankel approach is not as general as the one proposed by boisseau et al@xcite , as we have already seen that the former does not apparently apply to the skyrmion problem or to the blasius equation@xcite .",
    "however , our procedure is much simpler and more straightforward and may be a suitable alternative for the treatment of this kind of problems . besides , if our approach converges , it yields remarkably accurate results as shown in the examples above .",
    "for example , it gives us the slope of the electrostatic potential of the thomas  fermi theory with unprecedented accuracy ."
