    "despite their structural simplicity , carbon nanotubes possess exciting physical properties @xcite . besides their ultimate strength @xcite and elasticity @xcite , they particularly excel in the variability of their electronic characteristics that make them an attractive material for the applications in electronic devices @xcite .",
    "single - wall carbon nanotubes are small cylinders rolled up from a graphene strip with the shell being just one atom - thick .",
    "the gap between their valence and conduction band ( positive and negative energies ) depends on the diameter of the nanotube and on the orientation of the lattice in the shell .",
    "most of nanotubes are semiconducting , they have a nonzero gap in the spectrum with magnitude proportional to the inverse of the diameter .",
    "the gap can be altered either by external fields or mechanical deformations .",
    "the spectrum of carbon nanotubes in the presence of external magnetic and electric field was discussed in numerous works with the use of different techniques .",
    "for instance , the band structure of the nanotubes was considered within the framework of the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that the metallic nanotubes can be turned into semi - conducting ones ( and vice - versa ) by an external homogeneous magnetic field , parallel with the axis of the nanotube . in @xcite , the effect of a homogeneous transverse field on the spectrum was analyzed in the low - energy approximation .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the single - wall carbon nanotube in the presence of a specific external magnetic field that is constant in the longitudinal direction ( parallel with the axis of the nanotube ) , however , it has inhomogeneous transverse component ( perpendicular to the axis ) .",
    "the setting is analyzed within the framework of the low - energy approximation .",
    "we show that dynamics of the spin - up and spin - down components is described by the associated lam equation .",
    "the properties of the general finite - gap hamiltonians are employed extensively in the analysis of this equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the general description of single - wall carbon nanotubes in the presence of external magnetic field , explaining how the parallel and transverse fields affect the dynamics . in section 3 , we will introduce a solvable model that allows for explicit solutions of the stationary equation . then , in section 4 , we show that the system possesses nontrivial symmetries that establish @xmath0 nonlinear supersymmetry for metallic and maximally semiconducting nanotubes . next ,",
    "in section 5 , we discuss the robustness of the energy levels with respect to a small fluctuation of the momentum in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the last section will be devoted to some comments and outlook .",
    "we focus on the spectral properties of single - wall carbon nanotubes in the low - energy regime where the motion of quasi - particles is described by the dirac - weyl equation . before considering the system in the external magnetic field ,",
    "let us review briefly the case where the field is absent .",
    "the electronic properties of nanotubes can be easily deduced from the characteristics of planar graphene .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian of graphene in the vicinity of one of the dirac points , where the energy goes to zero , reduces to the two - dimensional massless dirac - weyl hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the stationary equation in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane can be written as @xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the energy and @xmath5 is the fermi velocity that depends on the crystal characteristics ( the hopping parameter ) of graphene .",

    "then , the dispersion relation reads @xmath8    the nanotube can be created by gluing together the long sides of a graphene strip .",
    "we fix the coordinates such that @xmath1 goes in the circumference direction , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the diameter , while @xmath2 is parallel to the axis of the nanotube .",
    "specific boundary conditions have to be prescribed at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "their explicit form depends on the orientation of the hexagonal lattice in the strip ; they are quasi - periodic in general @xcite .",
    "thus , the solution of ( [ fse ] ) has to satisfy the additional condition @xmath13 the spectral properties of nanotubes , and hence their electronic properties , will depend on the periodic condition ( [ boundarycondition ] ) .",
    "as we shall see in the following , the phase factor @xmath14 is vanishing for metallic nanotubes whereas it acquires nonzero value for semi - conducting nanotubes .    in order to make the wave functions ( [ fce ] ) compatible with the boundary condition ( [ boundarycondition ] ) ,",
    "the momentum @xmath15 has to be restricted to the discrete values @xmath16 the energies ( [ dr0 ] ) decay into a discrete set of values labeled by @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "[ dispersions ] for illustration , @xmath18 in particular , we have @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the gap @xmath21 between positive and negative energies will depend on the explicit value of @xmath14 , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , the gap is vanishing and the nanotubes are metallic since an infinitesimal excitation is sufficient to move the electron from valence to conduction band . for @xmath24 a gap is opened as the minimal distance @xmath21 is nonzero . the nanotube becomes semiconducting since an energy higher or equal to @xmath21 is needed to move the electron from negative to positive energy bands , which is the attribute of semiconductors .",

    "the magnetic field can be decomposed into transverse and longitudinal components ( perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the nanotube ) .",
    "it induces the lorentz force which is perpendicular to the movement of the charged particles .",
    "as the particles are confined to the two - dimensional surface , only the part of the transverse component which is normal to the surface has an effect on the trajectories of the particles .",
    "the longitudinal component influences the dynamics as well , however , it manifests in a quite different manner .    for convenience ,",

    "the component @xmath33 , corresponding to the longitudinal magnetic field , does not change the trajectory of a classical charged particle . however , as we will see now , it induces an additional phase shift of the wave functions , similarly to the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "we can get rid of @xmath33 in the equation ( [ r14c ] ) by extracting a suitable phase factor from the wave functions .",

    "this shows that the phase @xmath48 depends on the magnetic flux @xmath49 that goes through the nanotube section .    in the current framework",
    ", we can easily understand the effect where the metallic nanotubes are converted into semi - conducting and vice - versa by the longitudinal magnetic field .",

    "the gap decreases and the nanotube turns to be metallic again .",
    "this effect was called aharonov - bohm oscillation of carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "let the carbon nanotube be immersed into the external magnetic field ( [ mgfield ] ) where @xmath56 is constant along the nanotube .",

    "next , we suppose that @xmath223 is either even or odd with respect to the parity , i.e. @xmath224 , where @xmath225 . then we can write @xmath226 where we made the substitution @xmath227 in the first step and then employed the parity and anti - periodicity of the wave functions .",
    "since the left and the right hand side of the equality ( [ der1 ] ) differ just in sign , the integral has to be vanishing .",
    "hence , the energy corresponding to the spinor with the required properties is robust with respect to small fluctuations of @xmath95 .",
    "the states possessing required properties can be found in the kernel of the operator @xmath166 , which is formed by @xmath169 anti - periodic states @xmath228 , @xmath229 , by purely algebraic means , see @xcite .",
    "considering the specific case where @xmath96 , one can prove much stronger statement : the first - order correction ( [ energycorrection ] ) is vanishing for _ all _ energy levels .",
    "let us sketch the proof briefly , referring to appendix 2 for more details .",
    "first , it is convenient to find explicitly the coefficient @xmath230 .",
    "it is @xmath231 .",
    "next , there holds the following relation @xmath232 for @xmath147 and @xmath143 . substituting the explicit form of the wave function ( [ p ] ) into the integral ( [ energycorrection ] )",
    ", we get @xmath233 here we used the fact that @xmath109 is purely imaginary and substituted the explicit form of @xmath234 .",
    "the last equality is obtained since the integrand is an odd function of @xmath72 , which follows from ( [ odd ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ ecorm ] ) manifests that the energy levels of @xmath96 case are robust with respect to small fluctuations of the longitudinal momentum @xmath95 for any value of @xmath48 .",
    "in the current paper , we have considered the continuum model of the single - wall carbon nanotubes in the presence of a specific transverse magnetic field ( [ approx])-([b0 ] ) .",
    "the model is quite flexible as it also allows to control the inhomogeneity of the field by the modular parameter @xmath61 . for @xmath235",
    ", the field tends to the homogenous one while for @xmath236 it diverges from the constant value , see fig .",
    "[ pot ] .",
    "we elaborated in detail the case represented by the two - gap hamiltonian ( [ diraclame2 ] ) .",
    "the wave functions and energies were found for the vanishing longitudinal momentum , @xmath20 .",
    "the energies of the system were given as a solution of the transcendental equation ( [ bcelaborated1 ] ) .",
    "we checked that the model manifests remarkable stability with respect to the fluctuations @xmath208 of the longitudinal momentum .",
    "the considered systems belong to the family of finite - gap operators characteristic by existence of a nontrivial integral of motion ( [ y ] ) .",
    "we showed that they give rise @xmath0 nonlinear supersymmetry ( [ nonsusy ] ) for metallic and maximally semiconducting nanotubes .    in this article , we restricted ourselves to the dynamics in the vicinity of a single dirac point . when both dirac points are taken into account ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath237 block - diagonal operator .",
    "the @xmath238 operators on its diagonal describe the system at each of the two dirac points .",
    "in fact , the operator in ( [ diraclame2 ] ) would correspond to one of them .",
    "recently , the extended framework was used in the analysis of carbon nanotubes with finite - gap configurations of the pseudo - magnetic field generated by the axial twist @xcite .",
    "it was observed that when both dirac points are taken into account , there emerges a @xmath239 algebra of integrals of motion for the system with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the question arises whether a similar algebraic structure could be detected in the current system when both dirac points would be considered . despite",
    "that our current setting lacks time - reversal symmetry ( it is violated by the external magnetic field ) , we suppose that the algebra could exist for any strength of the parallel magnetic field @xmath56 as long as @xmath23 .",
    "the treatment here presented opens a number of interesting questions .",
    "as the wave functions of the lam hamiltonian are known explicitly for any integer @xmath74 , it suggests that it could be feasible to extend our results to the systems with a generic , integer valued , coupling constant @xmath74 . in particular , we have in mind the existence of the hidden @xmath0 nonlinear supersymmetry or the spectral stability of the system .",
    "our present results based on finite - gap hamiltonian provide a good basis for construction of other solvable configurations of external magnetic field .",
    "we have in mind to apply darboux transformations @xcite in the construction of new solvable hamiltonians from the systems presented in this paper .",
    "let us notice in this context that this technique proved to be very useful in the analysis of twisted carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the results supplied along this paper system can also serve as a test field for the analysis of a wider class of configurations with the use of rigorous methods like those applied recently in the study of low - dimensional nonrelativistic systems with external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , these considerations go beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "using the appropriate formulas for the jacobi zeta functions @xcite , we can find @xmath240 where we abbreviated @xmath241 in order to have @xmath129 real valued ( see ( [ p ] ) ) , the real part of ( [ zeta ] ) has to be eliminated .",
    "it can be done by fixing @xmath242 as an integer multiple of @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath243 then there holds @xmath244 and @xmath245 and the real part of ( [ zeta ] ) vanishing .",
    "we can write @xmath246 where @xmath247 .",
    "the relation ( [ p ] ) together with ( [ pdelta ] ) determine the relevant values of @xmath113 .",
    "the physically relevant values of @xmath113 ( or @xmath138 ) are given by the following equation @xmath248\\right)\\\\&=&\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{k}(\\delta+l),\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath249 $ ] denotes the integer part of a number and @xmath250 $ ] . without loss of generality , we can fix @xmath143 or @xmath147 with @xmath251 .",
    "the function @xmath107 is @xmath71 antiperiodic and odd with respect to the parity operator @xmath252 , @xmath111 , @xmath253 .",
    "the eta function is @xmath71 periodic and even with respect to the parity , @xmath254 , @xmath255 .",
    "next , there holds @xmath256 provided that @xmath72 is real .",
    "these properties can be obtained directly from the definition , see @xcite .",
    "there holds the following relation between the up and down components of the eigenfunction @xmath257 , @xmath258 where @xmath234 is a complex number that should be specified .",
    "there also holds @xmath259 then we can write @xmath260 so that @xmath261 . keeping in mind that @xmath262 , we can write @xmath263 hence , we get @xmath264 .",
    "now , we can simplify the integrand @xmath265 of the first - order energy correction , @xmath266 by inserting explicit form of @xmath267 and substituting the explicit value for @xmath234 .",
    "we get @xmath268 now , we will show that the integrand @xmath265 is odd with respect to the parity .",
    "since @xmath108 is @xmath71 periodic and even with respect to the parity , it is sufficient to show that @xmath269 taking @xmath143 , we can write @xmath270 similar result can be obtained for @xmath147 .",
    "we showed that the integrand @xmath265 is an odd function .",
    "hence , the first energy correction is vanishing identically , @xmath271",
