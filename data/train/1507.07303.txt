    "one of the major difficulties in the realization of quantum computing and quantum information processing is protecting the quantum state from decoherence .",
    "quantum error correction protocols were developed to meet this challenge @xcite . for a review and recent progress of this area ,",
    "see references @xcite .",
    "while quantum error correction can be regarded as a form of closed - loop control , dynamical decoupling has been proposed as a way to counteract the interaction between a quantum system and the environment by an open - loop control field .",
    "the idea of using pulse sequences , to protect nuclear spins from classical decoherence , dates back to 1950 , when the spin - echo method was found @xcite .",
    "since then , many pulse methods have been developed in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy @xcite . in 1998 ,",
    "it was first pointed out that a similar technique , periodical dynamical decoupling ( pdd ) , can be applied to open quantum systems @xcite . by using a control field , with duration shorter than the time scale of the environment",
    ", dynamical decoupling can suppress the interaction between a qubit and the bath @xcite .",
    "important theoretical progress was made by understanding the effect of dynamical decoupling as the result of a symmetrizing procedure over the group composed of all independent @xmath0 pulses @xcite .",
    "however , the finite switching time in real experimental conditions makes the symmetrizing imperfect .",
    "therefore , concatenated dynamical decoupling ( cdd ) was proposed to eliminate higher - order errors in the interaction hamiltonian @xcite .    in realistic experiments , the imperfection of pulses such as the rotation angle error and the finite width , must be taken into account .",
    "cdd is preferred over pdd in this case , due to the fact that concatenation not only suppresses the interaction with the environment but also the pulse errors to higher order @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , by optimizing the pulse interval to suppress the low - frequency region of the noise spectrum , uhrig dynamical decoupling ( udd ) can achieve the same suppression order with fewer pulses , compared with cdd @xcite .",
    "although it has superior performance , udd is very sensitive to pulse errors , due to the fact that it only uses single - axis rotations .",
    "however , to protect unknown states , uniform dd with multi - axis rotations can compensate errors due to its symmetric structure @xcite . +",
    "another development in dynamical decoupling is to use random pulses , instead of deterministic schemes , for sufficiently long sequences @xcite . instead of trying to suppress the interaction to arbitrarily high orders , random dynamical decoupling schemes improves the time dependence of the error accumulation from quadratic to linear @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we only consider deterministic uniform dynamical decoupling for two reasons : ( 1 ) it is easy to implement in experiment , and ( 2 ) it is robust against pulse error compared to udd .",
    "besides analytical calculations , recently many other dd sequences have been found using genetic algorithms to optimize the suppression order @xcite , some of which even achieve same suppression order with fewer pulses than cdd .",
    "however , a unified understanding of all known dd schemes has not been developed until now .",
