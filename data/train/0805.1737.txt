    "the potential pathways leading to the formation and destruction of these molecules are now believed to be well established .",
    "however , the relative importance of these pathways in a given astrophysical environment is generally poorly constrained due to a lack of suitable observations and the complex interaction of formation , destruction , and excitation mechanisms for  and oh .    both molecules are expected to be formed in abundance in hot molecular gas ( @xmath4k ) owing to a series of neutral - neutral reactions whose activation barriers are overcome at high temperatures . _ iso _ ( infrared space observatory ) , _ swas _ ( submillimeter wave astronomy satellite ) , and @xmath5 observations show enhanced oh and  abundances in stellar outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ? * @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the large beam sizes prevented a detailed spatial analysis , which is essential to investigate the oh and  formation processes that lead to the increased abundances .",
    "in addition , the submillimeter observations of  are mostly confined to the @xmath6@xmath7 transition of ortho-  at @xmath8ghz ( k ) , and the wavelength coverage of the _ iso _ long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) limited observations of oh to rotational states with @xmath9k .    in this paper , we present the first detection of rotationally excited oh at previously unobserved high excitation levels up to @xmath10k in @xmath1  with the _",

    "@xmath1 , one of the youngest known stellar outflows , is highly collimated , of extremely high velocity ( ehv ; jet speed of 100300  assuming an inclination of 5 to 10  with respect to the plane of the sky , see @xcite and @xcite ) , bipolar , and associated with a class0 protostar in the young stellar cluster ic348 .",

    "the unique combination of sensitivity , wavelength coverage , and mapping capabilities with _ spitzer _ enables us to study the spatial structure of the @xmath1  outflow bow - shock and to investigate the regions of shock - induced oh and  formation .",
    "@xmath1  was observed with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on 2007 march  12 .",
    "we mapped the outermost region of the southeastern outflow lobe using the irs short - low ( sl2/sl1 , 5.28.7/7.414.5@xmath0 ) , short - high ( sh , 9.919.6@xmath0 ) , and long - high ( lh , 18.737.2@xmath0 ) modules .",
    "the nominal spectral resolution is @xmath11128 as a function of wavelength for the low resolution and @xmath12 for the high resolution settings .",
    "the total exposure times were 588s for each sl , 720s for the sh , and 600s for the lh module .",
    "we also obtained irac ( infrared array camera , * ? ? ? * ) and mips ( multiband imaging photometer for spitzer , * ? ? ? * ) image mosaics of @xmath1  from the _ spitzer _ data archive .",
    "we performed the irs data reduction consisting of background subtraction , masking of bad pixels , extracting the spectra , and generating the spectral line maps with cubism v1.50 @xcite .",
    "we applied cubism s slit - loss correction function , and expect the absolute flux calibration of our spectrum to be accurate within 20% .",
    "a calibration to the observed mips 24@xmath0  photometry is unreliable due to the strong line emission and the more than 2 year time difference between our irs and the archival mips observations .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath1  displayed in figure  [ fig : hh211spec ] reveals a sequence of highly excited oh ( @xmath3 , @xmath13 ) pure rotational transitions arising in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 rotational ladders from to 69/2 , which result in closely spaced doublets that become partly resolvable only at wavelengths greater than 20@xmath0  in our spectra .",
    "an additional splitting due to @xmath16-doubling is only barely noticeable for the oh lines at the longest wavelengths in our spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed treatment of oh spectroscopy ) .",
    "the oh energy level diagram in figure  [ fig : ohenergy ] shows that the highest excited oh transition has an upper state energy of @xmath17@xmath18  ( @xmath10k ) above the ground level .",
    "note that the population of the oh energy levels probably extends to even higher energies , but the corresponding rotational transitions fall in the wavelength range of the low resolution irs modules below 10@xmath0 . due to the lower resolution ,",
    "the sl modules are not sensitive enough to detect the faint , narrow emission lines .",
    "in addition , there are oh cross - ladder transitions with @xmath19 , but all such transitions that fall in the 5 - 37@xmath0  region have transition probabilities orders of magnitude smaller than the intra - ladder transitions described above .",
    "nevertheless , we detect the two lowest excited oh ( @xmath3 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) cross - ladder transitions with upper levels @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and 420k ) at 28.94 and 34.62@xmath0  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hh211spec ] ) , respectively , indicating a substantial population in the lower oh @xmath25-levels .",
    "we did not unambiguously detect any pure rotational oh transitions from excited vibrational levels .",
    "the low resolution portion of the spectrum is dominated by the strong , pure rotational  ( 00 ) s(3)s(7 ) transitions and the much weaker  5.34@xmath0  line .",
    "in addition to the previously mentioned oh lines , the high resolution portion longward of 10@xmath0  shows  ( 00 ) s(0)s(2 ) including ( 11 ) s(3 ) at 10.18@xmath0 , hd ( 00 ) r(3)r(6 ) , numerous  ( @xmath3 ) pure rotational lines , and forbidden atomic fine - structure lines from , , , , and .",
    "the spectrum also has noticeable continuum emission longward of 15@xmath0 , which can be fitted by thermal dust emission at a temperature , represented by a modified blackbody with the dust emissivities of @xcite .",
    "two additional components at about 170k and 30k are needed to fit the complete continuum including the 815@xmath0  region and the mips 70@xmath0  flux of @xmath26 .",
    "there is also a strongly rising continuum shortward of 8@xmath0 .",
    "the peculiar nir continuum of @xmath1  was previously noted by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite , who interpret it as scattered light from the protostar escaping along the low - density jet cavity .",
    "in @xmath27 , we reported the detection of rotationally excited oh at previously unobserved high excitation levels in @xmath1 . as a consequence of the large oh dipole moment , the observed intra - ladder pure rotational transitions have large einstein @xmath28-coefficients of the order of 10 to 400@xmath29 .",
    "for comparison , our observed pure rotational  transitions have @xmath30@xmath31@xmath29 , the  lines have @xmath28-values of a few @xmath32@xmath29 , and the  s(0)s(7 ) pure rotational lines have @xmath28-values between @xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath29 .",
    "large @xmath28-values make collisional excitation of high energy levels very ineffective at lower densities , i.e.  the corresponding critical densities are usually much larger than the gas density .",
    "the observed oh lines in @xmath1  demonstrate that energy levels up to at least @xmath10k are well populated despite the large oh @xmath28-values .",
    "this fact , coupled with the observed distribution of oh line intensities , strongly suggests a selective , non - thermal origin of the high-@xmath25 oh excitation . for comparison ,",
    "a non - lte analysis of the  lines in our spectrum suggests a gas temperature less than a few 1000k .",
    "furthermore , all of our observed pure rotational  lines originate from energy levels with @xmath35k even though there are many pure rotational  transitions with @xmath36@xmath37@xmath29  from energy levels between 3000 and 8000k in the 1038@xmath0  wavelength range .",
    "theoretical and experimental laboratory studies show that oh molecules produced via photodissociation of at photon energies larger than about 9ev ( @xmath38 nm ) are mostly in the ground electronic and vibrational state but with a high rotational excitation favoring @xmath39 to @xmath40 with @xmath41k @xcite .",
    "this is because the absorption of uv radiation in the  ( @xmath42@xmath43 ) band produces oh in an excited electronic state , @xmath44 , which , in turn , efficiently yields highly excited ground - state oh ( @xmath45 ) molecules via a nonadiabatic crossing between intersecting potential energy surfaces ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this process leads to a highly selective formation of high-@xmath25 oh in the ground electronic and vibrational state , followed by a radiative cascade down the rotational ladders depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohenergy ] .",
    "this is consistent with our observed distribution of oh line intensities and our non - detection of oh pure rotational transitions from excited vibrational states .",
    "we will present a detailed non - lte excitation model of oh , , and  together with an analysis of the atomic fine - structure transitions in a subsequent paper .",
    "further evidence for the role of  photodissociation as a source of high-@xmath25 oh can be gained from spatial mapping of the emission lines .",
    "our _ spitzer _ irs maps cover the southeastern terminal shock of @xmath1 , which exhibits a typical bow - shock geometry in  and co emission @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps ] shows the spatial distribution of rotationally excited oh and  together with the 25@xmath0  dust continuum surface brightness .",
    "the highly localized optical  emission @xcite is practically coincident with the 25@xmath0  surface brightness maximum .",
    "their emission maxima are offset by about 1 , which is within the positional map accuracy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : maps ] ) .",
    "this region is located at the bow - shock apex , where the shock velocity is expected to be the highest and presumably most of the shock generated fuv radiation originates .",
    "the emission maximum of rotationally excited oh ( fig .  [ fig : maps ] , left map ) also coincides with the bow shock apex .",
    "although not shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] due to the limited spatial coverage , the emission maximum of the oh ( @xmath46 ) rotational lines in the sh wavelength range occurs at the same location .",
    "however , unlike , the continuum , oh , and  emission clearly extend well beyond the bow shock . using the 25@xmath0  continuum surface brightness as a surrogate tracer of the uv radiation field , we clearly note the presence of a radiative precursor upstream of the shock .",
    "note that although collisional grain heating due to inelastic gas - grain collisions may contribute to the dust heating in the bow shock , it is probably unimportant outside and ahead of the shock .",
    "our emission line maps show clear evidence of oh and  emission in the precursor region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : maps ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the chemical formation route via @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the dominant source of oh and  in the uv precursor upstream of the shock .",
    "these reactions have significant arrhenius activation energies ( @xmath49 about 3150 and 1736k , respectively ) and only proceed efficiently in dense , hot gas .",
    "the absence of rovibrational  emission in the preshock region confirms the absence of hot , shocked gas needed to directly form oh and  through gas chemistry .    instead , we propose that uv induced photodesorption of water ice from grain mantles and photodissociation of  either in the gas phase or directly in the grain ice mantles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are the primary sources of oh and  in the precursor .",
    "we evaluated the  photodesorption rate using the dominated fuv emission generated by a shock with a speed of and a preshock density of ( atomic shock models by j.  raymond , private communication ) .",
    "such a shock approximately reproduces our observed 12.8 , 25.2 , 26.0 , and  34.8@xmath0  emission line intensities , which are good indicators for @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see e.g.  fig .  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "our estimate shows that grain ice mantles can be efficiently removed via photodesorption on timescales of the order of assuming the experimentally measured  photodesorption yield for water ice of 3@xmath52molecules per photon and a  photodesorption cross section per individual water ice molecule @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of @xcite , who argued that a shock with @xmath53  would lead to complete upstream photodesorption of grain ice mantles assuming a photodesorption yield of @xmath52 . at the high visual extinction toward the terminal shock of the @xmath1  southeastern lobe , @xmath54mag @xcite , most of the gas phase water",
    "would otherwise be expected to reside frozen onto grains ( cf .",
    "it is interesting to compare our observation of @xmath1  with a recent _ spitzer _ irs detection of strong water emission toward the protostellar object iras  4b in ngc1333 by @xcite .",
    "these authors attribute the origin of this emission to the very dense , warm molecular layer of a protoplanetary disk . in this case , the main source of water is probably thermal sublimation of grain ice mantles in the warm surface layer as suggested by @xcite .",
    "sublimation is insignificant at grain temperatures below about 100k ( cf .",
    "the derived dust temperature of @xmath55k in @xmath1  from our dust continuum fit , see @xmath27 ) , but it becomes rapid above 120k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) .",
    "in addition to the strong  emission , we have subsequently identified oh emission limited to transitions with @xmath56 ( @xmath57k ) in the irs lh spectrum of iras  4b by reanalyzing the _ spitzer _ archival spectra originally published by @xcite .",
    "the comparatively low excitation of oh indicated by the absence of lines with to @xmath58 and the weakness of the oh emission relative to  in iras  4b are consistent with the proposed sublimation origin of water and suggest that fuv photodissociation of  plays only a minor role compared to @xmath1 ."
