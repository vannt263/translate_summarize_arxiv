    "rotating magnetospheres are widely believed to be responsible for the relativistic jet phenomenon in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "here we adress the question whether centrifugal acceleration of charged test particles at the base of such a jet magnetosphere may possibly produce a seed population of relativistic electrons which is required for efficient particle acceleration . for , in order to explain the origin of the nonthermal emission extending up to tev energies in some blazars ,",
    "several acceleration processes have been proposed among which fermi - type particle acceleration mechanisms ( i.e. diffusive shock acceleration @xcite ) are quite promising .",
    "however such kind of mechanisms require a pre - accelerated seed population of electrons with lorentz factors of the order of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore quite interesting whether in the case of agn centrifugal acceleration by rotating jet magnetosphere may potentially fill this gap by providing pre - accelerated seed particles . for an analytical treatment ,",
    "we consider the following simplified model : motivated by mhd - scenarios for the origin of jets via rotating jet magnetospheres @xcite ( see fig .  [ jet ] ) a projected two - dimensional model topology is applied where the magnetic field is supposed to rotate rigidly with a fraction of the rotational velocity of the black hole @xcite .",
    "test particles with rest mass @xmath6 and charge @xmath7 are assumed to be injected at time @xmath8 and position @xmath9 with velocity @xmath10 parallel to the rotating field line .",
    "consider the forces acting on a particle in a rotating frame of reference @xcite : particles , which are injected at ( @xmath8,@xmath9 ) with velocity @xmath10 along the magnetic field line @xmath11 experience a centrifugal force in the radial direction given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the lorentz factor and @xmath14 the angular velocity of the field .",
    "additionally , there is also a relativistic coriolis term in the noninertial frame governed by the equation @xmath15 which acts as a deviation - force in the azimuthal direction . in the inertial rest frame",
    "the particle sees the field line bending off from its initial injection position , therefore it experiences a lorentz force ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative velocity between the particle and the magnetic field line . due to the lorentz force",
    "a particle tries to gyrate around the field line .",
    "initially , the direction of the lorentz force is perpendicular to the direction of the coriolis force , but as a particle gyrates , it changes the direction and eventually becomes antiparallel to the coriolis force .",
    "hence , the bead - on - the - wire approximation is valid if the lorentz force is not balanced by the coriolis force @xcite . in this case , the accelerated motion of the particle s guiding center due to the centrifugal force may be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the constrained motion is then given by the azimuthal components of forces @xmath21 generally , the bead - on - the - wire approximation is supposed to break down if @xmath22 exceeds @xmath23",
    "( i.e. when @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ constraint ] becomes @xmath25 ) .",
    "using the argument that the hamiltonian for a bead on a relativistically moving wire @xmath26 is a constant of motion , the equation for the radial accelerated motion could be reduced to a simple form which has been solved analytically yielding @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , ( @xmath29 ) is the jacobian elliptic cosine ( sine , respectively ) , and @xmath30 is an elliptic integral of the first kind , i.e. @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the lorentz factor may then be written as @xmath33^{2}}\\,,\\ ] ] or , if expressed as a function of the radial co - ordinate , as @xmath34 apart from radiation losses ( e.g. inverse - compton losses in the radiation field of the accretion disk , see @xcite ) , the maximum attainable lorentz factor @xmath1 is in particular limited by the breakdown of the bead - on - the - wire approximation ( i.e. when the particle leaves the field line and thus , acceleration becomes ineffective ) in the vicinity of the light cylinder @xmath0 . using the definition of the hamiltonian @xmath35 and eq .",
    "[ gamma_r ] and setting @xmath36 , one may derive an upper limit for the maximum lorentz factor @xmath1 from eq .",
    "[ constraint ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder and where for clarification @xmath39 has now been inserted . for typical bl lac conditions , i.e. a light cylinder radius @xmath40 m , and a field strength @xmath41 t , eq .",
    "[ gmax ] results in an upper limit on the maximum lorentz factor @xmath42 .",
    "the results derived in the simple toy - model presented here support flares on accretion disks as providing a seed population of relativistic electrons with lorentz factors up to @xmath43 in bl lac type objects .",
