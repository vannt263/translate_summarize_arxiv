    "complex charged liquids present a variety of interesting phenomena such as like - charge attraction  @xcite and charge inversion  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena arise as a result of electrostatic correlations of counterions in the double layer  @xcite . to explore the ionic correlations between the overlapping double layers one must have accurate and reliable methods to study electrolytes in a slab geometry .",
    "similar difficulties are encountered when one wants to understand the thermodynamics of ionic liquid based supercapacitors  @xcite .",
    "electrolytes in a slab - like geometry have been extensively studied in the past  @xcite .",
    "however , the dielectric contrast between the solvent and the confining surfaces is usually not taken into account .",
    "this dielectric mismatch leads to polarization of interfaces which dramatically increases the mathematical complexity of the problem . for a single interface , the dielectric heterogeneity and the resulting induced surface charge can lead to a repulsion of electrolyte from the charged dielectric surface  @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been observed near charged colloidal particles  @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical and simulational works involving confined electrolytes neglect the dielectic contrast which results in an infinite series of image charges .",
    "while this significantly simplifies the calculations , it also fails to account for some of the fundamental physics of the overlapping double layers .",
    "recently wang and wang  @xcite presented a mean - field theoretical discussion of confined electrolytes between charged and neutral plates .",
    "in the same year , zwanikken and de la cruz  @xcite developed a liquid state theory which predicted that neutral confining polarizable interfaces can attract each other inside an electrolyte solution .",
    "similar result can be found in other works  @xcite .",
    "samaj and trizac  @xcite and jho  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite developed theories to study the distribution of confined counterions between charged plates , in a salt free system in a strong - coupling limit .",
    "some studies focused on the specific case in which the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium is much lower than of water  @xcite .",
    "jho  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite developed a simulation method for confined counterions based on the electrostatic layer correction  ( elc ) method  @xcite . also , tyagi  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite constructed the icmmm2d method which is the generalization of the mmm2d algorithm  @xcite , previously developed to study homogeneous dielectric slab systems .",
    "although these methods account for the surface polarization , they require a calculation of a sum of terms for the electrostatic potential that make simulations quite slow .",
    "similar difficulties are encountered with other simulation approaches  @xcite .",
    "boundary element methods ( bem ) consider the minimization of functionals and can be applied to systems with general geometries .",
    "some bem methods consider local polarization charge densities as dynamic variables  @xcite others , attempt to explicitly calculate the bound charge  @xcite .",
    "even though bem methods are expensive computationally , they have been extensively used to study general soft matter problems  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a simulation method based on 3d ewald summation with a modified correction for the slab geometry  @xcite .",
    "the method is simple to implement . it does not require summations of a slowly convergent infinite series of images during the simulation , and is comparable in time with a regular 3d ewald method .",

    ", we present a mean - field theory for 1:1 electrolytes and compare it with simulations . in section  [ r ] , we present the general results , and in the section  [ c ] , the conclusions .",
    "to perform simulations , we use a rectangular simulation box of sides @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the box contains @xmath3 ions of charges @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the valence of the ion and @xmath6 is the proton charge , confined in the region @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we set @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath14 should be infinite .",
    "this , however , is not practical in a simulation .",
    "instead , we explore the convergence of simulations as the number of images @xmath14 is increased .",

    "to speed up the convergence , we use the ewald method in which the ionic charge is partially screened by placing a gaussian - distributed charge of opposite sign on top of each ion  @xcite .",
    "we then add and subtract an opposite gaussian charge at the position of each ion and its images , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
