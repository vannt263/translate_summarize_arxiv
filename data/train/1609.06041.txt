    "within the famous total variation ( tv ) regularization framework , image reconstruction in low - dose ct is formulated as minimizing the cost function expressed as @xmath0 subject to @xmath1 , and that in few - view ct is formulated as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the tv norm which aims at regularizing the ill - conditioned reconstruction problem .",
    "a variety of iterative algorithms have been proposed for solving the above problems in ct reconstruction fields based on modifying classical iterative algorithms such as the gradient method , art ( algebraic reconstruction technique ) , sirt ( simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique ) , and sart ( simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique ) , often combined with the ordered - subsets ( os ) technique [ 1]-[10 ] ( and many others ) .",
    "however , it is fair to say that there exist very few iterative algorithms in engineering literatures , which not only converge fast but also can exactly solve the above tv - regularized problems .",
    "it is known that , from mathematical point of view , this difficulty partly comes from the non - differentiability of tv penalty . however , in applied mathematics fields , the research progress on this topic is very fast so that many nice algorithms to handle the tv regularization have been developed since 2010 .",
    "therefore , we believe that it would be time for ct engineers like us to develop and use more rigorous iterative algorithms for the tv - regularized image reconstructions .    in this paper , we propose a very fast iterative algorithm which can be applied to the above two typical tv - regularized image reconstructions in a unified way .",
    "the algorithm derivation is outlined as follows .",
    "first , the original minimization problem is reformulated into the standard saddle point ( primal - dual ) problem by using the lagrangian duality , to which we apply the alternating projection proximal ( app ) algorithm which belongs to a class of first - order primal - dual methods including chambolle - pock algorithm , generalized iterative soft - thresholding ( gist ) algorithm , and alternating extragradient ( ae ) algorithm [ 11]-[14 ] .",
    "however , the resulting algorithm converges very slowly , mainly because its overall structure is same as the simultaneous iterative reconstruction methods such as the classical sirt and sart algorithms . to overcome this drawback ,",
    "we precondition the iteration formula using the ramp filter of filtered backprojection ( fbp ) reconstruction algorithm in such a way that the solution to the preconditioned iteration perfectly coincides with the solution to the original problem .",
    "the final algorithm can be interpreted as the first - order primal - dual method accelerated by the fbp - type preconditioning using the ramp filter .",
    "unlike the famous known fbp - based acceleration technique called the iterative fbp algorithm [ 15],[16 ] , for both the above two different formulations ( low - dose ct and few - view ct ) , the proposed algorithm converges to the solution exactly minimizing the cost function .",
    "we evaluate this algorithm for both the low - dose ct case and the few - view ct case with 32 projection data . in the low - dose ct experiment ,",
    "the proposed algorithm converged with approximately 10 iterations to the almost same image as the gist algorithm with 1,000 iterations . in the few - view ct experiment , the proposed algorithm required only 3 iterations to reach to the almost same image as the chambolle - pock algorithm with 1,000 iterations .",
    "these accelerations were achieved by the introduction of fbp - type preconditioning in the primal - dual space ( in the saddle point formulation ) , which has not been investigated yet and is an original contribution of this paper .",
    "in this section , we formulate image reconstruction in the low - dose ct and review typical existing iterative algorithms .",
    "we denote an image by a @xmath4-dimensional vector @xmath5 and denote a corresponding projection data ( sinogram ) by an @xmath6-dimensional vector @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the system matrix which relates @xmath8 to @xmath9 by @xmath10 , where we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath9 is contaminated with statistical noise . throughout this paper , we assume that the projection data is acquired by the standard parallel - beam geometry so that @xmath9 consists of uniform samples of continuous projection data @xmath12 .",
    "normally , image reconstruction in this setup can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the penalized weighted least - squares ( p - wls ) cost function expressed as @xmath13    where @xmath14 denotes @xmath15 diagonal matrix in which each diagonal element @xmath16 is the inverse of noise variance @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the penalty function to smooth the image [ 17],[18 ] .",
    "although there exist several choices in @xmath18 , throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath18 is the tv penalty function defined by @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are inner product representations of finite difference operations around the @xmath22-th pixel along the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "see fig . 1 for the detailed definitions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "since 2008 when ge healthcare developed the asir ( advanced statistical iterative reconstruction ) software , iterative low - dose ct reconstruction has been progressed according to the following three stages .",
    "[ image space denoising ( 1-st generation ) ] this class of reconstruction methods first perform an fbp reconstruction followed by a smoothing by using an iterative edge - preserving denoising algorithm such as the tv - denoising and the mrf - based denoising .

    "however , it is well - known that is can not exactly minimize the p - wls cost function of eq .",
    "another limitation is that the penalty function @xmath29 needs to be differentiable so that the tv penalty , which is non - differentiable , can not be used .",

    "( 3 ) , this method converges to an exact minimizer of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , but it is rarely used mainly because the 2-d filter is computationally intensive and its design is troublesome .",
    "we note that the proposed algorithm derived in the following sections also uses the fbp - type acceleration as in eq .",

    "this result motivates us to develop an alternative fbp - type acceleration technique which is able to exactly minimize the wls and p - wls cost functions .     and the vertical difference @xmath34 used in the tv penalty function.,height=264 ]          from this section , we derive the proposed algorithm , which is based on reformulating the minimization of eq .",

    "in this paper , we proposed new image reconstruction algorithms for two typical tv - regularized reconstruction problems in tomography .",
    "the first algorithm ( algorithm 1 ) minimizes the tv - regularized wls cost function for the low - dose ct , and the second algorithm ( algorithm 2 ) minimizes the tv penalty under the data fidelity linear constraint for the few - view ct .",
    "the both algorithms were derived from the saddle point reformulation of each optimization problem followed by the preconditioning using the ramp filter of fbp reconstruction algorithm and applying the alternating projection proximal ( app ) iterative algorithm .",
    "we demonstrated that both algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 converge very fast while its convergence to the exact solution of each optimization problem is guaranteed .    on the low - dose ct reconstruction ,",
    "very recently , we began to use a shift - variant preconditioner instead of the smoothed ramp filter , which approximates @xmath136 better , and confirmed an essential improvement .",
    "on the few - view ct reconstruction , we began to extend the formulation to @xmath137 by introducing the error tolerance @xmath138 .",
