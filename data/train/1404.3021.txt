    "this is most noticeable in the double and triple ionization spectra of xe@xmath101 ( figure  [ fig : xe4to6789 ] ) .",
    "generally , the individual resonance strengths depend on the details of the various decay chains that lead from the primary @xmath4 hole to the different product ions .",
    "the slight differences between the cross sections for threefold and fourfold ionization of xe@xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : xe1to456 ] ) may be explained similarly .",
    "the apparent shift of the @xmath114 resonance features in the xe@xmath7@xmath106xe@xmath101 cross section to lower energies may be caused by unresolved resonances which are much suppressed in the xe@xmath7@xmath106xe@xmath36 and xe@xmath7@xmath106xe@xmath119 cross sections .",
    "in addition , the xe@xmath7@xmath106xe@xmath101 cross section exhibits a weak peak at 664  ev which may be associated with @xmath120 excitation .",
    "this peak is not discernible in the other multiple ionization channels .",
    "it is noted that pathways after @xmath4 photoionization of neutral xe have been investigated in more detail by applying electron spectroscopy and coincidence techniques @xcite .    for the comparison of the measured absolute cross sections with the calculated absorption cross sections we have summed all individually measured product channels for each primary ion . to a good approximation",
    ", these sum spectra represent the absolute experimental cross sections for photoabsorption . according to the findings of saito and suzuki @xcite for neutral xe , the sum of the three dominant ionization channels comprises more than 90% of total cross section for @xmath4 photoionization .",
    "therefore , we assume that the additional uncertainty of the experimental @xmath4 photoabsorption cross sections due to the neglect of unmeasured product charge states is less than 10% .",
    "experimental and calculated spectra are compared in figure  [ fig : sum ] .",
    "it should be noted that experimental and theoretical cross sections are both absolute , i.e. , there is no scaling of cross section involved in the comparison . in the energy ranges where direct @xmath4 ionization is dominant",
    ", experimental and theoretical cross sections agree to within 20% or better , i.e. , within the experimental uncertainties ( including the 10% summation uncertainty ) .",
    "the largest discrepancies ( at energies @xmath121  ev ) of up to 20% occur for xe@xmath76 and xe@xmath109 .",
    "there is no significant discrepancy for the other charge states .",
    "the situation is different for energy ranges which are dominated by resonances .",
    "the theoretical spectra were shifted towards lower energies by up to 3.5  ev ( figure  [ fig : sum ] ) in order to achieve a gross alignment of experimental and theoretical resonance structures .",
    "still most individual resonance structures do not match very well .",
    "there is disagreement with respect to resonance positions and resonance strengths .",
    "apparently , our simple single - configuration approach neglects important correlation effects .",
    "in addition , there may have been sizeable fractions of metastable primary ions ( table  [ tab : exci ] ) in the experiment with possibly non - negligible effects on the measured resonance structures .",
    "nevertheless , the calculations are very useful for assigning the measured resonances . accordingly",
    ", the most dominant ionization resonances are associated with @xmath122 and @xmath123 excitations ( @xmath124 ) with any pair of @xmath102 excitations being separated by the @xmath113 fine - structure splitting of @xmath3913  ev . for xe@xmath36 , resonances up to @xmath125 have been resolved ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : sum ] ) . at low energies , weak resonances associated with @xmath126 excitations are clearly visible for xe@xmath101 and xe@xmath36 . according to our calculations , @xmath127 excitations with @xmath128 are very weak for all primary ion charge states under consideration .",
    "the new photon - ion merged - beams setup pipe has successfully been used for measuring absolute cross sections for multiple @xmath4 photoionization of ions from the xenon isonuclear sequence .",
    "the measured cross sections exhibit progressively more resonance features as the primary ion charge state is increased from 1 + to 5 + .",
    "this finding is explained by the collapse of the @xmath129 wave functions into the inner atomic potential well which deepens with increasing charge state .",
    "absolute experimental cross sections for photoabsorption were derived by summation over all measured ionization channels .",
    "the present results are useful for modeling of the charge balance in astrophysical and technical plasmas .",
    "the main experimental cross section features were reproduced by single - configuration dirac - fock calculations .",
    "accordingly , the resonances are attributed to @xmath130 excitations with subsequent autoionization .",
    "competing @xmath127 excitations were found to play only a minor role .",
    "the theoretical cross sections for direct ionization agree with the experimentally derived absorption cross sections within the experimental uncertainties . however , the calculated resonance structures differ significantly from the experimental findings .",
    "this is attributed mainly to the neglect of correlation effects in the theoretical single - configuration approach .    with the present investigation we hope to stimulate more accurate theoretical work on inner - shell photoionization of complex ions .",
    "experimental spectra taken at higher resolving powers are already available .",
    "their detailed analysis is in progress and will be the topic of a forthcoming publication .    technical and financial support by desy is gratefully acknowledged . the construction and building of the pipe setup has been made possible by substantial funding from the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) under contracts 05ks7rg1 , 05ks7gu2 , 05ks7ke1 , 05ks7rf2 , 05k10rg1 , 05k10gub , 05k10kea , and 05k10rf2 within the verbundforschung  funding scheme .",
