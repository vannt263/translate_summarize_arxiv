    "star formation in the milky way and other galaxies is described as a ( mass and size ) scale - free , hierarchical process , in which turbulent gas forms large - scale structures with a mass distribution following a power - law .",
    "in essence , such a scale - free process leads to a mass and size fractal distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "young stellar groupings are clustered according to hierarchical patterns , with the great star complexes ( associated with the @xmath12 superclouds ) at the largest scales and the ob associations and subgroups , small loose groups , clusters and cluster subclumps ( e.g. @xcite ) at the smallest .    in several galaxies ,",
    "the interstellar gas appears to follow a fractal structure ranging from the subpc ( @xmath13 the current resolution limit ) to the kpc scales ; if star formation occurs preferentially at the densest regions , stars should form following such patterns ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in this context ,",
    "star clusters , formed at the core ( i.e. the densest regions ) of giant molecular clouds , can be taken as the unavoidable star formation product in a hierarchically structured gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a similar picture , in which star clusters are present in dense cores , emerges from numerical simulations that follow in time the collapse of gas clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , which also occurs when effects of radiative feedback and magnetic fields are included ( @xcite ) .                    .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in a hierarchical scenario , the turbulent gas forms large - scale structures ( clusters and loose groups ) with a mass distribution following a power - law of negative slope , i.e. @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , consistent with the mass distribution functions measured in several galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies came up with robust evidence indicating that star - forming regions are indeed hierarchically structured , for instance in the nearby spiral galaxies m33 ( @xcite ) , m51 ( @xcite ) , and ngc628 ( @xcite ) , the local group dwarf irregular galaxy ngc6822 ( @xcite ) , the galactic disk ( @xcite ) , and the gould belt ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the relative proximity , the magellanic clouds are an excellent environment to investigate the above issues .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the average age difference between pairs of lmc clusters increases as a function of their distance , which implies hierarchical star formation coupled to evolutionary effects .",
    "the angular correlation of lmc stellar populations for separations between 2  ( @xmath16pc ) and 40  ( @xmath17pc ) also implies large - scale hierarchical structure in current star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the character of the lmc hi structure as a function of scale , the filamentary and patchy structures of the high- and low - emission regions respectively , suggest that most of the ism is fractal , presumably the result of pervasive turbulence , self - gravity , and self - similar stirring @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a highly substructured and rapidly evolving distribution in the lmc stars .",
    "they suggest that all of the original structure is erased in @xmath18myr ( approximately the lmc crossing time ) , with small - scale structures mixing first .",
    "similar conclusions apply to the smc , in which stars appear to have formed with a high degree of ( fractal ) sub - structure , possibly imprinted by the turbulent nature of the parent gas ; these structures are subsequently erased by random motions in the galactic potential on a time - scale of a crossing time through the galaxy ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the degree of spatial correlation among the different kinds of lmc and smc extended structures listed in the updated catalogue of @xcite , together with its relation to star formation .",
    "we also study properties of their size distribution functions .",
    "only two wide - apart age ranges are used for spatial correlation purposes : _ ( i ) _ very young objects ( not older than @xmath19myr , and probably younger than @xmath20myr ) , which encompass clusters related to nebular emission and associations related or not to emission , as classified and catalogued from sky survey plates by @xcite and references therein , and _",
    "( ii ) _ old clusters ( older than @xmath21myr ) . according to our definition ,",
    "the dynamical age of the very young clusters is lower ( sect .",
    "[ 2pcf ] ) than the crossing time ( of the host galaxy ) , while for the old ones it corresponds to several crossing times , which is important for interpreting the spatial correlation in different time periods .",
    "clusters within the wide age range @xmath22myr are not used in the spatial correlation analysis ( sect .",
    "[ 2pcf ] ) .    only the magellanic clouds have so far such a deep , homogeneous information on star clusters , associations and nebulae .",
    "exceptions are some neighbouring dwarf galaxies that have been surveyed and are _ ( i ) _ featureless ( ursa minor ) , _ ( ii ) _ contain a few globular clusters ( fornax ) or , _",

    "the identification , characterisation and spatial distribution of old star clusters in the clouds has been a major concern throughout decades ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by old or red star clusters we mean those older than the hyades ( @xmath71myr ) , or intermediate age clusters ( iacs ) up to classical globular cluster ages .",

    "magellanic cloud clusters about this age appear to show dynamically evolved surface density profiles ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "thus , the old clusters as defined above have ages that correspond to several crossing times of the respective galaxy , and any memory of the clumpy structures where they were born should have been erased . in this sense , they can be used as probes of the long - term behaviour of the cluster spatial correlation ( sect .",

    "the differences in @xmath1 and slope probably reflect the several @xmath102yr of dynamical evolution of the old clusters , a consequence of which is an expansion of the outer parts ( e.g. @xcite ) of the clusters that survive the infant mortality ( e.g. @xcite ) phase , both in the the smc ( @xcite ) and lmc ( @xcite ) . ] .",

    "we have @xmath117 .",
    "this equation , together with central mass densities in the range @xmath118 , accounts for the distribution of cluster mass and core radius ( @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] the mass distributions for the lmc@xmath98smc clusters , as well as those corresponding to clusters of all ages , in which the basic features of the individual distributions are preserved .",
    "interestingly , the maximum mass of the lmc clusters younger than @xmath149myr ( @xcite ) , and smc ones younger than @xmath93myr ( @xcite ) , is about 2.4 times higher than that of the very young lmc and smc clusters ( table  [ tab3 ] ) . for lmc clusters younger than @xmath150gyr ( @xcite ) and smc ones younger than @xmath151gyr ( @xcite ) , the ratio increases to @xmath152 .",
    "although the somewhat different age ranges , consistency between both sets of @xmath126 values can be reached with the central mass densities @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively for the very young and old clusters .",
    "the somewhat higher values of @xmath108 in the mcs clusters , with respect to the galactic open clusters , is consistent with the relative cluster mass ranges encompassed by the lmc ( @xcite ) , smc ( @xcite ) , and milky way ( @xcite ) mass distributions .    finally ,",
    "if we take into account variations of m / l with age for the dominant ( in number ) young clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , the actual mass values for clusters younger than @xmath155myr would be @xmath156 lower than the average-(m / l ) estimates above , and @xmath157 higher for those with age within @xmath158myr .",
    "given that the number of clusters decreases with age ( see , e.g. @xcite , for the age - distribution of the mc clusters ) , our mass estimates in each bin of the mass distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) may be somewhat overestimated .",
    "in a hierarchical scenario , young star clusters are expected to preserve some memory of the physical conditions prevailing in their birthplace .",
    "because of random motions along many orbits under the galactic potential , the spatial distribution of old star clusters , on the other hand , should be very little reminiscent of the primordial one . according to this scenario ,",
    "the frequency of young star clusters lying relatively close to each other - and to star - forming structures - should be higher than for the old ones . based on the 590 lmc clusters ( @xmath80 of the present sample size - table  [ tab1 ] ) catalogued by @xcite with ages derived from the ubv colours by @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the average age difference between pairs of clusters increases with the separation , which they interpreted as resulting from star formation that is hierarchical in space and time . a similar result - and interpretation -",
    "was found by @xcite for pairs of open clusters in the milky way disk .",
    "we investigate this point further by means of the degree of spatial correlation among groups of objects characterised by different age ranges and sizes .",
    "we use the young and old star clusters defined in sect .",
    "[ yosc ] .",
    "consider two groups of objects , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "for each object in @xmath159 , we compute the angular separation with respect to all objects in @xmath160 . after applying the same procedure to all objects in @xmath159",
    ", we build the two - point - correlation function ( 2pcf ) , which measures the fractional number of pairs @xmath161 that lie within a given separation @xmath162 and @xmath163 , @xmath164 . according to this definition ,",
    "the 2pcf is simply the angular separation distribution function .",
    "artificial 2pcfs built with samples of points that emulate both the geometry and object distribution of the lmc and smc are used to check the statistical significance of the spatial correlations . in the simulations we randomly select the right ascension ( @xmath23 ) and declination ( @xmath165)coordinates of a given point within the actual ranges spanned by each cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and with the same number - frequency as the observed ones .    irrespective of the adopted geometry",
    ", a random distribution of objects would produce a number of neighbours within a given separation @xmath162 that increases as @xmath166 , at least for a maximum separation @xmath167 ( which should scale with the angular size of the simulated field ) .",
    "thus , the 2pcfs should increase with @xmath162 as @xmath168 .",
    "indeed , the 2pcfs derived with the simulations ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) present the expected dependence with separation for @xmath169 ( lmc ) and @xmath170pc ( smc ) . beyond these values",
    "both the measured and simulated 2pcfs consistently drop , as a consequence of the limited size of the clouds .    as a first step we compute the spatial self - correlation functions , in which @xmath171 , for the lmc and smc ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . compared to the simulated 2pcfs ,",
    "the non - clusters ( top panels ) present a relatively high degree of spatial self - correlation for separations smaller than @xmath172pc ( lmc ) and @xmath173pc ( smc ) .",
    "young ( age @xmath4myr ) clusters present a high degree of spatial self - correlation , from small to large scales ( middle panels ) , @xmath174pc ( lmc ) and @xmath173pc ( smc ) .",
    "old ( age @xmath7myr ) clusters , on the other hand , have a very low degree of spatial self - correlation , restricted to separations @xmath175pc ( lmc ) and @xmath176pc ( smc ) .",
    "interestingly , the same pattern is obtained with the 2pcfs computed for the clusters older than 1gyr , with the age determined from cmds .",
    "some degree of spatial correlation at small separations among old clusters is expected , since the clouds contain binary and/or merger star clusters preferentially of comparable ages ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in summary ,",
    "young clusters have a probability of being clustered together significantly higher than old ones , both in the lmc and smc .",
    "the dynamical age of clusters older than @xmath177myr corresponds to @xmath178 crossing times in the lmc , and @xmath179 in the smc , while for the young ones ( age @xmath4myr ) it is @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively for the lmc and smc .",
    "given that a single crossing time is necessary to smear out most of the primordial structural pattern ( @xcite ) , the above conclusion is consistent with the old clusters having been mixed up by the random motions under the galactic potential along several @xmath102 years , while the young ones still trace most of the birthplace pattern .",
    "now we test the degree of spatial correlation of the young and old clusters with the non - clusters ( star - formation environments ) .",
    "as expected from the self - correlation analysis , the young clusters are highly correlated with the non - clusters ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the old clusters , on the other hand , appear to have some spatial correlation with the non - clusters only at the very - small scales , @xmath182pc ( lmc ) and @xmath183pc ( smc ) .",
    "part of this correlation may be due to projection effects on the bar . for larger separations",
    "the 2pcfs can be accounted for by the random distribution of objects .",
    "now we examine the spatial self - correlation among clusters and non - clusters of different radius ranges .",
    "based on the respective radius distribution functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , we take @xmath184pc as the boundary between small and large clusters ; for the non - clusters we take the boundary at @xmath185pc . the derived correlation functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) indicate that the small clusters are more spatially correlated than their large counterparts .",
    "the same applies to the non - clusters .",
    "again , this picture is what should be expected from a hierarchical structure .",
    "finally , we investigate the effective separation of the young and old clusters with respect to the non - clusters .",
    "we first compute the effective separation ( @xmath186 ) between a cluster and a non - cluster , which we define as the ratio of the angular distance ( @xmath162 , converted to the absolute scale ) to the radius of the non - cluster ( @xmath187 ) , @xmath188 . in this way , a cluster that is located inside a non - cluster has @xmath189 .",
    "two - point correlation functions built with all the @xmath186 between samples @xmath159 and @xmath160 thus provide a measure of the clustering among objects in both samples . for comparison",
    "we use simulated 2pcfs built for object samples ( young and old clusters and non - clusters ) with coordinates selected as described in sect .",
    "we now also include absolute radii separately for each sample , randomly taken from the observed distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the resulting 2pcfs are shown in fig .",
    "consistently with the analyses of the previous sections , young clusters in both clouds present a high degree of clustering with the non - clusters , especially for small effective separations ( @xmath189 ) , but reaching as well high values of @xmath186 .",
    "in all scales , the clustering degree of the old clusters with respect to the non - clusters , on the other hand , can be accounted for by a random distribution of old clusters .",
    "the above results are consistent with a strong hierarchical structuring of the young star clusters in both clouds , including their time evolution effects .",
    "in broad lines , when star formation occurs in turbulent gas , large - scale structures are expected to be produced following a power - law mass distribution ( @xmath190 - @xcite ) , and with hierarchically clustered young stellar groupings ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we address the above issue by investigating the degree of spatial correlation among sets of lmc and smc extended structures , characterised by different properties , and its relation to star formation .",
    "based on the catalogue of @xcite , we built sub - samples that basically contain star clusters ( young and old ) and nebular complexes ( and their stellar associations ) .",
    "the latter structures are related to star - forming regions ; for simplicity , we refer to them as non - clusters .    in all cases ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] ) , the radius distribution functions follow a power - law ( @xmath0 ) decline for large radii with slopes that depend on object class ( and age ) . taking both clouds combined ,",
    "the non - clusters fall - off with a slope @xmath2 and reach sizes of @xmath3pc .",
    "old ( age @xmath7myr ) clusters present the somewhat steeper slope @xmath8 , while the young ( age @xmath4myr ) ones have the steepest slope @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum size reached by clusters is less than @xmath191 of the non - clusters , with the old ones reaching a size @xmath192 bigger than the young ones .",
    "the differences in slope and maximum size between the young and old clusters can be accounted for by long - term dynamical effects acting on the clusters . by means of a radius to mass",
    "scaling ( sect .",
    "[ mdf ] ) , we show that the mass distribution of the lmc and smc clusters follows @xmath105 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , with @xmath15 . within the uncertainties ( table  [ tab3 ] )",
    ", this value agrees with the slope expected in a hierarchical scenario ( @xcite ) . also , the mass distribution for clusters younger than @xmath93myr falls off towards large masses faster than the clusters older than @xmath193myr .    according to the two - point correlation functions ( sect .",
    "[ 2pcf ] ) , the lmc and smc star clusters younger than @xmath93myr present a very high degree of spatial correlation among themselves and , especially , with the non - clusters ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "clusters older than the hyades ( @xmath7myr ) on the other hand , appear to have been heavily mixed up , probably because their ages correspond to several galactic crossing times and the strong perturbations associated with the lmc and smc encounters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when the analysis is restricted to clusters older than 1gyr - with the age determined from cmds , the same conclusions are obtained .",
    "considering two different radius ranges , we show that small clusters ( @xmath10pc ) and non - clusters ( @xmath11pc ) are spatially self - correlated , while the large ones are not ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . also , young clusters in both clouds present a very high degree of spatial clustering with the non - clusters , which does not occur with the old ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .    the above results , expressed in terms of the spatial and size distribution of extended structures in the lmc and smc , are fully consistent with a hierarchical star - formation scenario , in which star complexes are part of a continuous star - formation hierarchy that follows the gas distribution .",
    "similar conclusions drawn from different methods and samples of objects have been obtained for the lmc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the smc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    vista and other large telescopes will certainly uncover a large number of faint clusters in the magellanic clouds , with masses comparable to the galactic open clusters . the same for embedded clusters .",
    "cmds will provide accurate ages for them , as well as for many luminous , intermediate - luminosity , and low - luminosity clusters already catalogued .",
    "also in this context , the catalogue by @xcite will be an essential tool , for having gathered and cross - identified the small and large structures in the magellanic clouds .",

    "the lmc and smc disks are inclined with respect to the line of sight , and this should introduce some variations in the absolute sizes across the disks , as compared to the no - inclination approach adopted in sect .",
    "[ distribfunc ] .    to investigate the inclination effect on the radius distribution functions we assume @xmath194 ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xmath195 ( e.g. @xcite ) as the inclination of the lmc and smc disks with respect to the line of sight .",
    "then , the absolute size of each cluster was recomputed for its corrected distance . the inclination - corrected radius distribution function ( for the combined lmc@xmath98smc clusters )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , in which the un - corrected distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , panel f ) is also shown for comparison purposes .",
    "we conclude that differences are small , essentially within the error bars .",
    "this can be accounted for by the relatively small distance corrections ( with respect to the adopted cloud distances ) , and that corrections affect objects both in the near and far sides in the opposite sense . on average ,",
    "when a large number of objects is considered , the near and far - side corrections tend to self - compensate .",
    "another effect that might introduce variations on absolute cluster size is the triaxial nature of the clouds .",
    "the smc , for instance , may have a line - of - sight depth of 6 - 12kpc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , depth corrections would be of the same order as those related to inclination .",
    "since extended structures are the focus of this work , the surface brightness ( sb ) incompleteness - which is expected to affect the radius distribution functions - should be taken into account .",
    "basically , for a given luminosity , a more extended object will have on average a lower sb , and thus may not be detected by depth - limited surveys .",
    "we examine this effect by means of a sample of @xmath196 artificial star clusters whose luminosity and radius distributions are described by @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "these analytical functions describe star clusters and hii regions . to reproduce the input radius and luminosity distributions ,",
    "the simulated radius and luminosity are computed from @xmath199^{1/2.3}$ ] and @xmath200 $ ] , where @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 are the minimum and maximum radii and luminosities , and @xmath205 and @xmath206 are random numbers in the range @xmath207 $ ] .",
    "the radius and luminosity of a given cluster are independently assigned .",
    "this process allows that clusters of the same size ( and mass ) - but different ages - may have different luminosities , as expected from the fading lines associated with the stellar evolution .",
    "also , clusters with any radius within ( @xmath208 ) are allowed to have any luminosity within ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "then , the sb is computed in the usual way , @xmath210 , in arbitrary units .",
    "the results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . in general",
    ", the sb distribution among the simulated clusters agrees with the expected relation of decreasing sb with cluster radius ( panel a ) .",
    "the two power - laws that describe the radius and luminosity distributions are reflected on the shape of the sb distribution ( panel b ) , which first ( beginning at the smallest and most luminous clusters ) increases exponentially towards lower sbs , reaches a maximum , and falls off exponentially towards the largest and less luminous clusters .",
    "based on this distribution we arbitrarily apply cuts for clusters with @xmath211 and @xmath212 and compute the corresponding radius distributions ( panel c ) .",
    "clearly , the sb cuts preserve the power - law character of the radius distribution .",
    "the major effect is a steepening of the slope . indeed , while the complete radius distribution is a power - law of slope @xmath213 , the sb - restricted distributions have @xmath214 , and @xmath215 , respectively for @xmath211 and @xmath212 .    in summary ,",
    "sb - related incompleteness affects the radius distributions preferentially at the large - clusters tail , having little effect on the small clusters . also , it preserves the power - law character of the radius distribution and , due to the preferential effect on large clusters , it produces a steepening of the distributions .",
    "thus , the decrease in the observed radius distributions towards small clusters ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] - [ fig5 ] ) can not be accounted for by sb incompleteness , and appears to be linked to an observational effect . in this sense",
    ", vista will be important also to explore the structure of small clusters in the clouds , and to investigate the shape of the radius distribution at the small scales ."
