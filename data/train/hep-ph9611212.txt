    "the non - abelian self couplings of gauge bosons are the most direct consequences of the @xmath1 gauge symmetry and a direct confirmation of triple gauge boson couplings ( tgc ) is one of the most important subjects at lep2 .",
    "most studies up - to now have focused on the process @xmath2 . although this process is anticipated to give a good sensitivity to the anomalous couplings , it suffers from the disadvantage that one can not disentangle the effects of @xmath3 and @xmath4 couplings .",
    "especially , the gauge cancellations between @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 exchange graphs are still not fully operative at lep2 , hence , only the interference effects between different tgcs dominate .",
    "one way to avoid such complications is to use the channels which is only sensitive to the @xmath3 coupling .",
    "recently we have proposed a new probe of the @xmath3 vertex using @xmath0 process where the electron escapes down the beam pipe  @xcite . in this report",
    ", we give a brief summary of the characteristics of the single - w production and present the anticipated sensitivity to the anomalous tgcs .",
    "figure  [ f - diag2 ] shows a gauge invariant set of @xmath8-channel diagrams involved in @xmath9 . among them ,",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath10 process ( the first row ) give the dominant contribution .",
    "even below the ww threshold , a significant contribution is expected from the @xmath5-@xmath10-@xmath10 diagram ( the second graph ) .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath8-channel can be enhanced by requiring the outgoing electron to be within a small angle . to calculate the cross - section with this requirement",
    ", special care has to be taken of the following points ; ( 1 ) the matrix element needs to keep even the electron mass finite throughout the calculation to avoid a singularity at small electron polar angle ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the gauge violating term due to the introduction of the finite width of w is found to blow up at small @xmath11  @xcite , and stops one from obtaining reliable cross - section as a result .",
    "this problem can , however , be avoided by several methods  @xcite and the results of each scheme are found to be consistent  @xcite .",
    "here we use a four - fermion generator `` grc4f ''  @xcite for the calculation . in this package , all the fermion masses are properly taken into account and the gauge violation due to the finite width of the w is cured  @xcite .",
    "one can thus perform a cross - section calculation reliably even without a cut on the electron polar angle .",
    "we mainly focus on the @xmath9 process in this report since the signature is very clean from an experimental point of view . to discriminate single - w from ww , we introduce `` single - w cuts '' : @xmath12 35 mrad , @xmath13 0.95 and @xmath14 20 gev . the resulting event signature is high p@xmath15 `` single muon '' .",
    "as is seen in figure  [ f - evdist ] , double resonant contribution is clearly suppressed while keeping single - w .",
    "the total cross - section of the single - w process with @xmath16 final state is shown in table  [ tab : xsect ] .",
    "one can observe `` single muon '' events from single - w production with modest luminosity at lep2 .",
    "@xmath17 ( fb ) & 28 & 39 & 50 & 54 +",
    "to test the triple gauge boson coupling , we use the following effective lagrangian  @xcite assuming both @xmath18 and @xmath19 conservation : @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 or z , and the overall couplings are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath26 is required to be 1 by electromagnetic gauge invariance , deviations from the standard model are defined as 5 parameters : @xmath27    the anomalous tgcs are already severely constrained by low energy data  @xcite .",
    "the parameters in equation ( [ eq : tgc1 ] ) are no longer independent each other in order to protect low energy observables from acquiring discrepancies with the experimental data  @xcite . in case the @xmath28 gauge symmetry",
    "is realized linearly , only three of the five couplings are found to be independent  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath29 couplings are related to the @xmath30 ones with the equations : @xmath31 the anticipated best sensitivity from the w - pair analysis at lep2 are inferred based on this relation , which are found to be  @xcite : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast to the w - pair production , the observable of the single - w process is less sensitive to these relations since the contribution from the @xmath29 vertex diagram for single - w process is very small at lep energies .",
    "we demonstrate the variation of the cross - section at @xmath35 192  gev as a function of each anomalous coupling in figure  [ f - acgamz ] .",
    "the cross - section depends only marginally on @xmath29 related couplings while we see a large sensitivity to @xmath30 ones .",
    "this orthogonal feature against @xmath29 couplings not only helps to extract anomalous @xmath30 couplings alone but also constrain @xmath29 couplings once the w - pair analysis restricts the parameter space along equation ( [ eq : tgc2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f - ac1w_ww]-a ) , b ) and c ) illustrate a specific sensitivity to the anomalous coupling as a function of @xmath36 . in figure",
    "[ f - ac1w_ww]-a ) , the solid line corresponds to the standard model cross - section with `` single - w '' cut .",
    "if we assume anomalous couplings to be @xmath37 , we get a significantly larger cross - section ( dashed line ) .",
    "also in the figure , the ratio of two cases ( b ) and the difference between two ( c ) are shown as a function of @xmath36 . the enhancement factor of about 6 is expected , which is in marked contrast to w - pair production since the measurement of the ww total cross - section is not sensitive to the anomalous coupling around the lep energy region .",
    "we give the sensitivity for w - pair production as dashed lines in figure  [ f - ac1w_ww]-b ) and c ) , where the `` canonical cuts ''  @xcite are made to enhance ww contribution .",
    "the w - pair case is much less sensitive than the single - w case .",
    "the anticipated sensitivity based on 1-parameter fit for the anomalous couplings are ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 , at 95% c.l . , where @xmath35 192  gev and @xmath40 500pb@xmath41 are assumed .",
    "we emphasise that one can improve the limits further by including other leptonic and hadronic channels .",
    "the hadronic channel is especially very attractive because of its large cross - section ( @xmath42350fb at @xmath35 192  gev ) .",
    "single - w process is , in general , more sensitive to @xmath43 than to @xmath44 .",
    "although the anticipated bound on @xmath44 will not be attractive ( @xmath45 ) , the sensitivity of @xmath46 is expected with @xmath40 500pb@xmath41 which is comparable to that will be obtained from w - pair studies  @xcite .",
    "we have for the first time presented the tgc studies making use of single - w production at the lep energy region .",
    "the cross - section measurement of this process are found to give good sensitivities to the anomalous couplings , in particular to @xmath43 .",
    "we emphasise that the precise study of the @xmath30 vertex from @xmath0 process is important to disentangle the complex effects coming from @xmath30 and @xmath29 vertices which will be obtained from w - pair production analyses . in this sense , the bounds from single - w process are complementary to w - pair ones .    * acknowledgements : * the author would like to thank minami - tateya theory group of kek for their physics discussions and technical help in grc4f system .",
