    "when a measuring device is accelerated in the same motion as the atom , the monotonic decrease of the @xmath2 is manifest in the high acceleration limit .",
    "this means that the relativistic motion of the measuring device restrains the precision of phase quantum estimation .",
    "it is found out that the obvious oscillation of @xmath2 occur under the condition that the trajectory of the atom is close to the boundaries .",
    "this provides us a possible way to enhance the precision of phase quantum estimation in the relativistic situation .",
    "let us examine the magnitudes involved in some possible experiments .",
    "the natural scale of units is fixed by fixing units for the energy gap @xmath6 of the atom , namely @xmath90",
    ". for atomic gaps of @xmath91 , one natural unit of acceleration corresponds to @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the earth surface gravitation acceleration ) @xcite .",
    "the acceleration required in our scenario can be reduced by the use of qubits with smaller gaps .",
    "for example , for special qubits defined by nuclear spins , energy gaps can be limited to the order of @xmath94 , which can reduce the acceleration to almost @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the scale of acceleration can be realized in @xmath96 setups .",
    "in addition , qubits with stark shifted atomic levels or zenner - induced transition nearly have energy gaps of the order of @xmath97 . for these qubits ,",
    "the acceleration can reach @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "those accelerations are indeed experimentally achieved for short time intervals .",
    "current technology of ion trapping and superconducting circuits allows for experiments where relativistic effects can be observed .",
