    "a principal goal of colliding heavy - ions at high energy is to verify whether one can create small drops of equilibrated quark gluon plasma in the laboratory .",
    "kinetic equilibration is not surprising given the high collision rates and is validated by thermal features of the data , especially observables related to collective flow @xcite and jet quenching @xcite .",
    "chemical equilibrium is more difficult to justify .",
    "the final - state abundance of hadrons suggests that chemical equilibrium was lost just after hadronization when the temperature was near 165 mev @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there is scant experimental evidence that chemical equilibrium was maintained during the period when @xmath0 mev when the matter is expected to be in a phase of strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . that chemistry is remarkable .",
    "counting spins , colors and flavors , there are 36 light degrees of freedom from the up , down and strange quarks , and an additional 16 from gluons .",
    "thus , approximately 52 strongly interacting particles should inhabit a volume on the order of one thermal wavelength cubed , @xmath1 .    at high temperature and zero baryon density , the chemical make - up of the qgp",
    "can not be quantified by counting quarks or gluons because they tend to be off - shell or virtual , so their number is not a well - defined observable .",
    "however , even though the average charge within a volume @xmath2 is zero , the fluctuations of the charge characterize the degrees of freedom .",
    "if one considers the three - by - three fluctuation tensor , @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 referring to the up , down and strange charge , one can gain insight into the chemistry .",
    "if up , down and strange quarks are good quasi - particles with no inter - quark correlations ( a gaseous state ) , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of quarks of the given flavor , up , down or strange .",
    "correlations between quarks , such as the two being in the same hadron , alter the expression . for a hadron gas",
    "the correlations are @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density of hadron species @xmath10 which has a charge @xmath11 . as an example , protons contribute a factor of four times their density to @xmath12 because the `` up '' charge of a proton is two . even for strongly interacting and correlated systems",
    "@xmath13 is a well - defined observable , because charge is conserved by the strong interaction . from equation [ eq : chihad ]",
    "one can see that hadronic resonances induce off - diagonal elements to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath14 contributes negatively to @xmath15 and a @xmath16 hyperon gives a positive contribution to @xmath15 .",
    "for a massless gas of quarks and gluons , the number of quarks within a fluid element of fixed entropy stays constant during an isentropic expansion because both the number densities and the entropy density scale as @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in an isentropic expansion of a massless parton gas the number of quarks within the fluid element stays relatively constant .",
    "lattice calculations show that this property remains reasonably preserved even for a strongly interacting system . the ratio @xmath18 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] where it changes only at the 10% level once @xmath19 mev .",
    "below that temperature , the system is hadronizing and @xmath20 is strongly temperature dependent . due to entropy conservation , the number of hadrons just below @xmath21 is marginally lower than the number of quarks above @xmath21 , so given that each hadron has two or three quarks , copious quark production , through string breaking or resonance decays , accompanies hadronization .",

    "are increased numbers of up and down quarks in the hadronic phase , whereas the number of strange quarks is slightly smaller .",

    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    unfortunately , charge fluctuations , @xmath24 , are not directly accessible from experiment .",
    "if one could measure the charge fluctuation within a small volume , a few @xmath25 , one would expect the fluctuation to approximate that of an equilibrated system as long as the equilibrated system does not have correlations beyond that scale .",
    "however , if one considers the net charge in the entire system , it does not fluctuate due to the fact that , unlike the assumptions for a grand canonical ensemble , the net charge is fixed and @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , the charge correlation @xmath27 is sensitive to both the equilibrated charge fluctuation and accounts for the conservation of net charge . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the charge density per unit of spatial rapidity and the brackets denote averages over events .",

    "if all fluid elements begin at @xmath31 and if the elements do not accelerate longitudinally , which is expected for a boost - invariant system , the spatial rapidity can be associated with the longitudinal velocity of the fluid element , @xmath32 .",
    "if a particle moves with the fluid , its spatial rapidity stays constant @xcite .",
    "if chemical equilibrium is attained and if the correlations are local the correlation becomes @xmath33 where the @xmath34 function can be relaxed to some function of short range that integrates to unity . for the realistic situation where the charge is created locally and diffuses over a finite distance , the correlation becomes @xmath35 the last condition derives from charge conservation .    even though the net charge over the entire collision volume does not fluctuate and even though the short - range correlation only carries information about the current value of @xmath20 , one can gain insight into the temporal history of @xmath13 by analyzing the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath36 , or in a three dimensional analysis on @xmath37 . for example , if @xmath18 were to stay constant after the initial time , @xmath38 would be a broad function with a width determined by how far charge pairs produced early would separate over the history of the collision .",
    "this width might be driven by a combination of two effects .",
    "first , if the balancing quarks are produced by the fragmentation of a longitudinal flux tube , the tunneling would lead to the charges being significantly separated at birth along the beam direction , perhaps by a solid fraction of one unit of spatial rapidity . for example , if the quarks were born with a separation of 0.5 fm , and were created at a proper time of 0.5 fm/@xmath39 , the separation would be on unit of spatial rapidity .",
    "in contrast , if particles were born 0.5 fm apart at a time of 5 fm/@xmath39 , the separation would be only 0.1 units of spatial rapidity . if the system maintains local chemical equilibrium , as defined by the lattice calculations displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] , at hadronization a second contribution to @xmath40 would arise to account for the change in @xmath13 .",
    "this second contribution to @xmath38 would be more tightly constrained in @xmath36 due to the reduced time available for the charges to diffuse away from one another",
    ".    diffusion represents another mechanism of separation . for",
    "a strongly interacting qgp the diffusion constant and the separation would tend to be smaller . from @xcite one can estimate the diffusive separation with a simple analytic formula based on assuming cross sections stayed constant with temperature .",
    "the diffusive width to the balance function was @xmath41 if the cross section of @xmath42 mb = 1.0 @xmath43 were used , and if the density scaled by the time @xmath44 were @xmath45 @xmath46 , and if @xmath47 , the particles would separate by approximately one unit of spatial rapidity .",
    "if several collisions were required to re - thermalize a particle the diffusive separation would increase .",
    "the correlations in terms of charges , @xmath40 , translate into correlations between specific hadronic species @xmath10 and @xmath48 , , @xmath49 a relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be derived if one assumes that a small balancing charge is spread randomly , or thermally , amongst the hadrons @xcite .    using a blastwave prescription , which provides a parametric description of thermal emission overlaid with collective flow and includes the effects of decays",
    ", one can then project the correlations in coordinate space to correlations in momentum space .",

    "the picture assumes two surges of charge production : one where the initial equilibrated matter would be formed and a second corresponding to the jump in the susceptibilities near @xmath21 . to that end",

    "the spread in spatial rapidity at breakup from the two surges will be described by two widths , @xmath55 for the first surge and @xmath56 for the second surge .",

    "if the final @xmath108 ratios are similar , results change little .",
    "the blast wave picture used here is perhaps the simplest model that can readily incorporate two surges while providing a reasonable mapping between the correlations in coordinate space and those in asymptotic relative rapidity .",
    "if both widths @xmath55 and @xmath56 are set equal to one another , it becomes a one - surge model .",
    "of course , both charge creation and emission are more complicated than what can be described in this picture .",

    "each point in space would then contribute to the final @xmath40 .",
    "however it is clear that , if the system stays close to chemical equilibrium , the bulk of these contributions comes from two surges .",
    "additionally , if either surge is not strongly confined to a specific time , the shape of the ensuing correlation should no longer be gaussian , even if the separation is purely diffusive .",
    "a second weakness of the model comes from the assumption that the matter disassociates simultaneously according to a single breakup temperature , @xmath105 , but with yields determined by a single temperature @xmath106 . for shorter",
    "lived resonances like the @xmath111 meson , yields should substantially drop between the two temperatures .",
    "thus , the contributions from resonance decays are probably significantly overstated . however ,",
    "if a neutral particle decays and rethermalizes , the ensuing relative rapidity of the two charges is not wholly different than if the two decay prodcucts escaped unscathed , because these decays have relative momenta of typical thermal scales . despite these shortcomings ,",
    "the two - surge model should provide an insightful point of comparison .",
    "a more realistic picture of creation , transport and emission of conserved charges is currently being pursued by some of the authors .",

    ", we apply an approximate acceptance and efficiency correction so that the true widths of the balance functions can be better discerned .",
    "this correction is approximate and based on an assumption that the balance functions depend only on the relative rapidity , or equivalently that the balance functions do not depend on the transverse momenta of the two particles . assuming equal numbers of particles and antiparticles , the balance function can be exactly expressed as @xmath115 } { \\int dp_ady_a~n_\\alpha(p_a , y_a)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath116 referring to the transverse momentum coordinates of the particle of type @xmath10 and @xmath117 doing the same for type @xmath48 .",

    "if the quark content of the first surge is below equilibrium , the second surge would have to compensate for it and the @xmath113 balance function would have a positive narrow contribution , which is not seen in the data .    of the four balance functions studied here , the @xmath114 balance function is the most sensitive to the separation of scales , @xmath161 , and most strongly illustrates the need for two surges .",
    "this derives from the cancellation of the opposite - sign weights for the @xmath94 and @xmath162 contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtwoscale ] ) . if @xmath55 were to equal @xmath56 the balance functions would nearly cancel as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : onesurgetwosurge ] . as @xmath163 , both the narrow positive peak near @xmath164 , and the broad negative feature for @xmath165 become more pronounced .",
    "the @xmath62 balance function is the least sensitive to changing model parameters for two reasons .",
    "first , the pions are light and their thermal motion smears any structure in relative rapidity .",
    "second , nearly half the balancing @xmath62 pairs come from resonance decays that produce both a positive and negative pion .",
    "figure [ fig : components ] shows the contribution to each balance function in the default two - surge calculation from the first and second surges , and from decays below the chemical freezeout temperature .",
    "the @xmath62 balance function is strongly affected by decays .",
    "the decay contribution is constant in the context of this model , but could easily be sensitive to alterations of the model not considered here . in particular , this model assumes the chemical yields of various resonances do not change below chemical freezeout , @xmath23 mev , and kinetic freezeout when the particles are emitted , @xmath166 mev . in a realistic calculation resonances like",
    "the @xmath111 would decay and their products would rescatter before final emission . their contribution might then move to lower values of @xmath77 because the relative momentum of the pions from a @xmath167 decay tend to be higher than those from thermal motion .",
    "of course , the yields themselves might be different . an improved calculation would include the effects of rescattering and baryon annihilation , better account for the spectral shape of the broader mesons , and more accurately describe the acceptance and efficiency for which weak decays , e.g. the @xmath168 , are captured by the detector .    because the strangeness susceptibility is rather flat near the transition region , and because few resonances decay to @xmath112 , the @xmath112 balance function is dominated by the first surge . in both the preliminary star data and in the models , contributions from @xmath169 decays have been removed .",
    "the @xmath112 balance function is then an excellent candidate to determine @xmath55 . due to baryon annihilation near and below chemical freezeout",
    ", the baryon susceptibility drops and the second - surge contribution to the @xmath113 balance function is negative . if not for thermal smearing , one would see a dip in the @xmath113 balance function . in reality , much of the annihilation occurs at the very end of the reaction and involves baryons with small relative momenta .",
    "thus , the negative contribution from baryon annihilation should be more pronounced than the calculations shown here .",
    "the @xmath114 balance function is especially insightful because the two contributions have similar strengths and opposite signs .",
    "for this reason , the resulting peak can be remarkably narrow , and followed by a shallow negative contribution at larger @xmath77 .",
    "this makes it possible for modest changes in model parameters to significantly affect the size and shape of the @xmath114 balance function .",
    "the negative dip at larger @xmath77 requires a large experimental acceptance .",
    "even though star has an acceptance of @xmath170 units of pseudo - rapidity , the acceptance in rapidity for protons and kaons is effectively narrower due to the mapping of rapidity to pseudo - rapidity for more massive particles .",
    "combined with the small size of the balance functions , star s measurements of the @xmath114 balance function for @xmath171 is difficult .",
    "figure [ fig : parsens ] makes a case that the first surge of particle production is close to what one would expect from chemically equilibrated matter . however , the study of model responses shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parsens ] is quite incomplete given that model parameters can be changed in a coordinated fashion .",
    "a more rigorous method is to simultaneously vary all model parameters while comparing to all the data . here , we present results from not only changing the four model parameters mentioned before , but four additional parameters . the posterior likelihood is calculated in this 8-dimensional space by comparing to all four balance functions .",
    "this will provide a distribution of likely parameters that not only provides the most likely point , but provides the full likelihood in the 8-dimensional space by a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) procedure .",
    ".[table : parameters ] eight parameters were simultaneously varied between the min and max ranges shown above .",
    "the first four parameters were two spatial rapidity widths , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the quark to entropy ratio of the first surge @xmath160 , and the strangeness to up ratio of the first surge @xmath159 .",
    "the other four parameters varied the blast wave kinematics : the kinetic freezeout temperature @xmath105 , the transverse flow parameter @xmath104 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uperp ] ) , the baryon reduction factor @xmath172 which accounts for baryon annihilation , and @xmath173 , which accounts for the anisotropic shape of the phase space distribution in momentum space due to viscous effects .

    "the first seven parameters were described in sec .",
    "[ sec : twosurgemodel ] and the eighth accounts for the fact that the momentum distribution might not be anisotropic . after generating thermal particles ,",
    "the momenta are scaled by a matrix @xmath174 this factor reduces the thermal smearing when mapping the spatial and momentum rapidities and gives narrower balance functions .",
    "however , it does not affect the width of the decay contribution .",
    "even though the calculation of the balance functions requires only @xmath175 minutes of cpu time , hundreds of thousands of points need to be calculated during the mcmc trace . using the techniques of model emulators in @xcite , the likelihood",
    "is calculated by interpolating principal components of the data from 1536 full model runs .",
    "the full model runs were performed at points spread throughout the parameter space according to latin hyper - cube sampling .",
    "these techniques are described in @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis assumes gaussian forms for the likelihood , @xmath176 where the experimental , @xmath177 , and model , @xmath178 , are compared relative to the uncertainty @xmath179 .",
    "the eight parameters are considered to have uniform prior distributions as listed in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath179 encapsulate not only experimental uncertainties , but any uncertainties one might expect from missing physics in the model .",
    "this can be thought of as a systematic theory error . for",
    "a schematic model such used here , assigning uncertainties is ad hoc , which means the final likelihood distribution is also suspect .",
    "however , even with that caveat , the statistical analysis helps determine what parameters best fit the data and can also assist with understanding which observables are best constraining specific parameters of interest . for this analysis , each individual point in the balance function",
    "was used , except for the first bin in relative rapidity .",
    "this bin carries both experimental difficulties due to two - track resolution and is strongly affected by femtoscopic correlations , which are ignored by the model .",
    "the uncertainty for each point was defined as @xmath180 effectively a twelve percent error .",
    "this seems rather large , but because neighboring points in a balance function provide similar information and are similarly susceptible to theoretical approximations , groups of points can be redundant .",
    "for example , if the same quantity is measured four times , a 12 percent error falls to a six percent error .",
    "so if each balance function were divided up into groups of four points , the error would translate into half this uncertainty .",
    "the mcmc method described here was repeated with several forms for the uncertainty . for smaller uncertainties",
    "the likelihoods became more compact , but the position of the maximum likelihood did not change significantly .",
    "in addition to the balance functions , the mean transverse momenta for pions , kaons and protons were treated as observables .",
    "the values were averaged from star and phenix measurements and a 6 percent uncertainty was assigned .",
    "each balance function had 17 points , due to the binning being in units of 0.1 in relative rapidity and extending to @xmath181 , with the first bin being neglected .",
    "the four balance functions thus provided 68 observables , adding the three mean transverse momenta result in 71 observables .",

    "the eight plots along the diagonal show one - dimensional projections , while the off - diagonal plots show two - dimensional projections .",
    "the quark content of the first surge is close to expectations from the lattice calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] , but might be 5% high . given that entropy production during the collision",
    "might be at the ten percent level , the entropy used in the denominator here might be ten percent higher than the entropy at early times .",
    "thus , it would be not surprising if the @xmath185 ratios extracted here would be 10 percent lower than the expected values for lattice calculations .",
    "this implies that the @xmath160 ratio may actually be @xmath186 higher than expectations and that the strangeness content , may be about 15% lower than such expectations .",
    "this variation is at the @xmath182 level in the comparison here , but because defining the uncertainty was rather arbitrary , stating a discrepancy between an extracted value and a lattice value is correspondingly arbitrary .",
    "the widths of the two surges are strongly constrained by the analysis .",
    "the first surge s width is close to unity , which is in line with expectations .",
    "the characteristic width of the second surge appears to be just below half the broader width , @xmath187 .",
    "this differs from the previous analysis of @xcite , which found a preference for @xmath188 .",
    "this change is being driven by the inclusion of the @xmath114 balance function .",
    "if neglected , there is a preference to fit the @xmath62 balance function by lowering @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the two balance functions are somewhat at odds with one another , which suggests that some physics is being poorly described or missing",
    ". a possible culprit would be the way in which decays are treated .",
    "if the number of decaying particles is significantly reduced between chemical and kinetic freezeout , the @xmath62 balance function , which is strongly affected by decays , might narrow . the balance function with @xmath189 , would then be able to better reproduce both balance functions .    as a test of the statistical procedure we consider an assortment of balance functions calculated from random points in parameter space . in the left - side panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : priorpost ] the parameters are taken randomly from the prior , i.e. they are random numbers generated between the minimum and maximum values listed in table [ table : parameters ] . on the calculations for the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : priorpost ] the parameters were taken randomly from the posterior distribution , i.e. weighted by the likelihood .",
    "these points were extracted from taking 40 points far away from one another in the mcmc trace .",
    "whereas the balance functions on the left - side panels vary widely and often stray far from the data , the balance functions from experimentally constrained parameters on the right side come close to the data .",
    "the @xmath62 balance function varies only modestly as parameters are varied throughout the prior , which means it has limited resolving power , although this could change if the @xmath62 balance function turns out to be significantly sensitive to missing or poorly represented physics , e.g. reabsorption of hadronic decays into the medium .",
    "in contrast , the other three balance functions vary widely throughout the prior , as was expected from the studies presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : parsens ] .",
    "these measurements then have much higher potential to discriminate between different sets of parameters .",

    "the parameters for the right - side balance functions were also randomly generated , but the choices were weighted with the experimental likelihood .",
    "this validates the statistical procedure and serves as a guide for how strictly the definition of uncertainties constrains the fits.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    given the large numbers of parameters and observables , it can be difficult to understand the degree to which given measurements contribute to constraining the parameters , or the degree to which a measurement , if changed by one sigma , would lead to new parameters .",
    "in @xcite methods were derived to perform sensitivity analyses from the mcmc trace .",
    "one such measure is the quantity , @xmath190 keeping all other @xmath191 fixed .",
    "this addresses the question of how the average value of a specific parameter @xmath192 in the posterior would change if a single observable @xmath118 were altered without repeating the entire mcmc with a new value of @xmath177 . in the expression above the double brackets , @xmath193 ,",
    "refer to an average from the posterior , and single brackets @xmath194 denote the average over the prior .",
    "figure [ fig : dxdy ] shows the values of this partial derivative where the parameters @xmath192 are scaled by the widths of their priors so that @xmath195 , and the observables @xmath118 are scaled by their uncertainties @xmath179 .",
    "the resulting derivative then describes how much the parameter would change as a fraction of its prior width when the parameter @xmath118 is increased by @xmath179 .",
    "figure [ fig : dxdy ] presents a much more detailed set of information than what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parsens ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath190 is shown for every combination of 71 observables and 8 parameters .",
    "this describes how an extracted value for a parameter , @xmath196 , would change if a given observable were increased by one sigma while keeping the other observables fixed .",
    "each of the four balance functions provides 17 observables , corresponding to the 18 rapidity bins with the first bin being ignored .",
    "the first 17 observables along the @xmath197 axis represent the @xmath62 balance function , and the other three balance functions are represented by each subsequent group of 17 observables",
    ". additionally , the three mean transverse momenta for pions , kaons and protons are included as observables .",
    "for example , one can see that the extracted value of @xmath159 would fall / rise if the low momentum bins of the @xmath112 balance function were raised / lowered .",
    "the response is opposite for bins of higher relative rapidity .",
    "one can also see the relatively strong resolving power for the @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 balance functions . ]",
    "preliminary star measurements of charge balance functions for specific species provide strict constraints on any picture of the chemical evolution of the super - hadronic matter created in heavy ion collisions . in order to fit all four of the balance functions ,",
    "the blast - wave model used here had to employ two separate surges of charge production .",
    "balancing charges from the first surge appear to have separated by approximately one unit of spatial rapidity by the time the matter reaches chemical freezeout .",
    "charges from the second surge appears to have spread a bit less than half that amount .",
    "it is difficult to determine the physics driving the spread of the first surge",
    ". it may mainly be due to the separation inherent to breaking strings , or equivalently the tunneling of balancing charges in the breaking of a flux tube .",
    "another possibility is that the spread is largely diffusive .",
    "either way , the charges must be created early if they are to separate by such a large distance by chemical freezeout .",
    "the strengths of the two surges can also be determined by comparing the two - surge model to data .",
    "remarkably , the strength of the first surge is consistent with the matter from the first surge approaching chemical equilibrium .",
    "a model run based on assuming perfect equilibrium , followed by an isentropic expansion , reproduces the preliminary star data at the 5% level . a more comprehensive search through eight - dimensional parameter space , including four parameters that adjust the blast - wave description ,",
    "show that the best chemistry for fitting the data has susceptibilities within 20% of those calculated on the lattice .",
    "the response of the measurements to the susceptibilities was found to be strong , and thus should provide good resolving power within the context of any model .",
    "measurements were shown to be sensitive to both the spread and the strength of the charges .",
    "the preliminary star measurements considered here are the first of their kind , and should inspire numerous additional measurements of different species , measurements as functions of relative azimuthal angle @xcite and transverse momentum , and as a function of the three - dimensional pair momentum . as a general statement ,",
    "balance functions are six - dimensional correlations that can be measured between any two species pairs .",
    "every new combination of species and every more differential binning of the six - dimensional phase space should provide new insights and better shed light onto the story of the chemical evolution of the reaction .",
    "in addition to higher statistics , these goals may also require expanding the acceptance of current experiments . here",
    ", we provide a quick list of some measurements that would help illuminate an assortment issues :    * measurements of unidentified particles have been made as a function of both the relative and total azimuthal angle .",
    "however , one could consider the relation between the width in azimuthal angle and relative rapidity",
    ". balancing charges that are created early can be preferentially selected by considering the balance function at large relative rapidity , and should also have broader balance functions in relative azimuthal angle .",
    "this might help distinguish the physical cause of the separation of early charge pairs , diffusion vs. flux tube breaking . *",
    "the star collaboration s acceptance for identified particles extends to @xmath170 units of pseudo - rapidity , but when translated into real rapidity is significantly narrower for heavier particles like kaons and protons .",
    "the alice detector at the lhc covers @xmath198 units of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "atlas and cms cover much wider regions , but without particle identification .",
    "the long - range correlations should better illuminate the early production charges .",
    "for instance , if a measurable fraction of pairs comes from the initial state , those balancing charges might be particularly well separated .",
    "the greater acceptance would also make it easier to perform the analysis mentioned in the preceding bullet . * in order to better understand decays , balance functions can be binned as a function of the invariant mass or momentum .",
    "contributions from specific decays , e.g. @xmath199 , can be identified by their peak .",
    "contribution from broader resonances such as @xmath200 may be more difficult to see , but nonetheless the comparison should be able to identify whether the populations of unstable resonances are poorly represented by this , or any other , model .",
    "* measurements can be performed as a function of beam energy and centrality @xcite and for different choices of colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "the narrowing of the balance function for unidentified particles may be related to the existence of two surges @xcite , but that conclusion needs to be investigated in detail alongside the analyses listed above .    if these measurements are to lead to truly rigorous conclusions , the models must improve beyond the schematic blast wave model considered here . in order to justify gaussian forms for the two surges ,",
    "each surge must be created during a short time .",
    "more realistically , charges are created continuously according to the rate at which @xmath18 is changing . the evolution of the charges and the creation of new charge pairs after chemical freezeout is an area that was poorly modeled here . by the time of kinetic freezeout many of the resonances",
    "will already have decayed , with their products being reabsorbed by the medium .",
    "baryon annihilation , which was implemented here by reducing the baryon yield at chemical freezeout , in fact occurs mostly later .",
    "the corresponding dip should then be more concentrated at low relative momentum , a feature that is indeed seen in the data .",
    "these improvements can not be naturally added to a schematic blast wave model , but they can be accounted for in microscopic simulations .",
    "such calculations are entirely tractable and are being performed currently by this group .",
    "once the models can encapsulate all the important physics , statistical analyses like those presented here can lead to much more convincing and rigorous conclusions .",
