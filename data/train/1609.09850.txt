    "fingerprint identification is the most historic , developed and widely used biometric technology .",
    "everyone shares different fingerprint lines , especially minutiae which include ridge ending and ridge bifurcation .",
    "so minutia is very important in fingerprint identification .",
    "an automatic fingerprint identification system(afis ) is concerned with some issues include image acquisition , features extraction and matching  @xcite . as for latent fingerprints , which are usually obtained from crime scenes ,",
    "have very poor quality .",
    "since latent fingerprints usually have fuzzy ridges and lack of finger regions , the traditional algorithms do nt work well in latent fingerprints .",
    "generally , a good quality fingerprint can be easily segmented and extracted .",
    "so the minutia extraction will be a trivial task of extracting singular points .",
    "jain  @xcite follows the simple idea of ridge extraction , thinning and minutia extraction .",
    "but in latent fingerprints , fingerprint region is difficult to located and ridge is fuzzy .",
    "so algorithm based on ridge extraction and thinning does not work well in latent fingerprints .",
    "feng  @xcite has proposed a minutia extraction algorithm based on gabor feature . to overcome the influence of creases and noises , they extract minutia through gabor phase field and measure minutiae reliability through gabor amplitude field .",
    "but limited in hand - craft features , the minutia descriptor still ca nt overcome the complex noises .",
    "considering the limitation of hand - craft features , representation learning that learns features automatically through data is a good way to solve the problem .",
    "sankaran  @xcitehas used stacked denoising sparse autoencoders to extract minutiae .",
    "the minutia and non - minutia descriptors learned from a larger number of tenprint fingerprints are used to extract minutia .",
    "they have gained a promising results on latent fingerprint matching on nist sd27 database .",
    "however they learned the descriptors from minutia patches , which lost some global information . and",
    "the orientation of minutia is ignored which is really important in minutia matching . some algorithms focus on the enhancement of latent fingerprints  @xcite because of the importance of orientation field in minutia extraction and even fingerprint identification .",
    "minutia extraction can be seen as an object detection problem .",
    "overfeat  @xcite has present a framework for convolutional network to solve detection problem .",
    "region - based convolutional network(r - cnn )  @xcite attempt to solve the problem through two steps .",
    "firstly some category - independent proposals are generated through selective search  @xcite .",
    "and secondly the proposals are classified using linear svms . in fast r - cnn@xcite convolutional network",
    "is used to classify the proposals , and features are extracted directly through raw image instead of every proposal .",
    "so they got a better results and less time cost .",
    "considering the limitation of selective search , faster r - cnn  @xciteuses fully convolutional network  @xcite to generate proposals , so the net is trained end - to - end to generate proposals .",
    "the region proposal network shares full - image convolutional layers with detection network , thus the proposal network is nearly cost free .    in order to extract reliable minutiae directly from raw latent fingerprint , we propose a novel algorithm based on fully convolutional network to extract minutiae effectively and calculate their orientations .",
    "our algorithm can be summarized as two main steps .",
    "( i)generate proposals from raw fingerprints in pixel level using fully convolutional network .",
    "each point at the raw fingerprint will get a minutia - like score , and a threshold is used to classify minutiae and non - minutiae .",
    "location regression is used as a multi loss task to get more accurate locations of minutiae .",
    "( ii)classify the proposals and calculate their orientations .",
    "the orientation is calculated through a multi - task loss layer consisting of minutia classification , location regression and orientation regression .",
    "the key contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "a novel algorithm is proposed to extract minutiae in pixel level effectively based on fully convolutional network .",
    "2 .   minutia descriptor is learned end - to - end that no middle process is required .",
    "reliable minutiae are extracted directly from raw fingerprint without segmentation or enhancement .",
    "minutia is a special structure in fingerprint including ridge ending and bifurcation .",
    "fully convolutional network(fcn ) is used to map raw fingerprints to a minutia - score map with a fixed stride .",
    "minutia - score map generates proposals in pixel level through a given threshold .",
    "and then a cnn is learned to classify these proposals and calculate their orientations .",
    "the architecture of our network is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overall ] .",
    "our algorithm follows two steps,(i)generate proposals in raw fingerprints in pixel level using fcn .",
    "( ii)classify the regions centering at proposed minutiae and calculate their orientations using cnn .",
    "fcn is used to map raw fingerprint to minutia - score map with a fixed stride .",
    "minutia - score map is the output of the network , and each point is a minutia - like score corresponding to the raw fingerprints . in this paper 16 is used as the fixed stride that we considered as the tolerance scope of location distance . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overall ] , fcn is learned to generate proposals in raw fingerprints in step 1 .",
    "every 16 * 16 region in raw fingerprints is mapped to one single point in minutia - score map .",
    "the score gets bigger when it s more likely to contain minutiae in the corresponding region , and ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "thus a threshold can be used to generate proposals .",
    "location regression is also used as a multi - task loss to get more accurate locations of minutiae .",
    "the architecture we used is formed of two parts .",
    "the former convolutional layers are showed in table .",
    "[ table : sharedconvlayers ] . in our practice , three pretrained models are used to initialize the former convolutional layers , including zf model  @xcite , vgg model  @xcite and deep residual model  @xcite .",

    "the expanded regions centering at proposal points are put into a convolutional network(cnn ) with multi - task loss layer consisting of minutia classification , location regression and orientation regression .",
    "the proposals are expanded to 32 * 32 regions that we consider having enough information to determine their classes . in order to accelerate the minutiae extracting speed , we force step 1 and step 2 to use the same features extracted from raw fingerprints , by sharing the same convolutional layers in fig .  [",
    "fig : overall ] .",
    "and we add some extra layers to meet different targets , as shown in tab .",

    "[ fig : fastrcnn ] shows the flowchart of region - based classification and orientation regression .",
    "the minutia regions are extracted in feature maps corresponding to fingerprints in fig .",

    "the loss function consists of three parts : classification , location regression and orientation regression .",
    "it is defined as below : @xmath4    here @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents the predicted probability , location and orientation respectively .",
    "the symbol with star means its corresponding ground truth .",
    "@xmath7 multiplied to @xmath8 and @xmath9 means that only minutia point is concerned to contribute to the loss . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are set to be 1 and 3 in our experiments .",

    "[ eq : l2 ] .      in order to accelerate the minutiae extracting speed , fcn and cnn will share the same convolutional layers .",
    "inspired by the faster r - cnn  @xcite , a 4-step training is used :    1 .",
    "training fcn with raw latent fingerprints and the net is pretrained by zf net .",
    "then proposals are generated with the fcn .",
    "training cnn with proposals generated in step 1 and the net is pretrained by zf net .",
    "training a new fcn with raw latent fingerprints and the net is pretrained by cnn in step 1 . and",
    "the convolutional layers are fixed .",
    "training a new cnn with proposals generated in step 3 and the net is pretrained by cnn in step 1 too . and",
    "the convolutional layers are also fixed .",
    "now the two networks shares the same convolutional layers .",
    "then a latent fingerprint can be extracted following several simple steps : calculate feature maps , generate proposals , region - based classify and calculate orientations .",
    "since our proposed algorithm detect minutia points directly from the raw fingerprints , several minutiae around a ground truth minutia will all be assigned true .",
    "actually only one minutia will be set to be true corresponding to a manually marked minutia . to solve this problem ,",
    "non - maximum suppression(nms ) is used to suppress minutiae which are too similar to a high - score minutia . in this paper ,",
    "16 pixels and 30is used to clip the redundant minutia points .",
    "nms is used to clip the proposals generated in step 1 to assure that step 2 s training data will not be clustered to several high score proposals . in our experiments this is really important for training .",
    "nms is also used in final output to clip the redundant minutiae which matched to the same manually marked minutia .",
    "we compare our proposed algorithm with other algorithms in terms of minutiae extraction performance and latent fingerprints identification performance .",
    "our trained model is also visualized to see that we have successfully extracted features preserving ridges and valleys of a latent fingerprint .",
    "large number of training examples are required to learn a deep convolution network .",
    "therefore , an expanded latent fingerprint database was collected for training .",
    "the database contains gray scale fingerprint images collected by china s police department from crime scenes .",
    "in all there are 4205 latent cases and corresponding minutiae data validated by professional team of latent examiners .",
