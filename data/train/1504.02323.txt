    "in recent @xmath6 dynamical lattice simulations with the manifestly chiral - invariant overlap dirac operator , a new symmetry of mesons of given spin has been discovered upon truncation of the quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator , refs .",

    "we then arrive at the @xmath173 generators of the @xmath174 symmetry .",
    "all symmetry patterns derived in the above sections for two flavors , apply for three and @xmath162 flavors as well .",
    "we have mentioned in the introduction , that upon subtraction of the lowest - lying dirac modes from the valence quark propagators a degeneracy of all mesons from the 15-plet is observed .",
    "clearly , this is not accidental and reflects some inherent in qcd dynamics .",
    "a priori one expects that elimination of the quasi - zero modes should restore the chiral @xmath17 symmetry in hadrons since the quark condensate of the vacuum is connected with the density of the quasi - zero modes via the banks - casher relation @xcite",
    ". however , not only degeneracy patterns from the groups @xmath17 and @xmath18 are seen , but a larger symmetry @xmath175 .",
    "naively one could assume that all the interesting nonperturbative physics is removed with the low - lying modes and what remains is some output from perturbative interactions .",
    "such a simple assumption can be ruled out , however . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proven that a system of free or weakly interacting quarks in a box is not compatible with the degeneracy of the ground states with opposite spatial parity seen in our lattice results .",
    "such a degeneracy necessarily implies that we deal with the bound ( confined ) system of quarks .",
    "secondly , within a perturbative approach only the @xmath17 symmetry can be obtained , since it is a symmetry of the qcd lagrangian and consequently of perturbation theory .",
    "thirdly , the energy of the quark - antiquark system with perturbative interactions should be around two bare quark masses , and not of the order 1 gev .    the very fact that we observe a higher symmetry than the symmetry of the qcd lagrangian",
    "does imply that we deal with a highly nontrivial nonperturbative system . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proven that there is no color - magnetic field in this bound ( confined ) system .",
    "there is only a color - electric field that binds the quarks .",
    "here we present an alternative way to support this statement .    from eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) it follows that the colour - coulomb part of the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge ( @xmath30 denotes the faddeev - popov determinant ) @xmath176 which describes the interaction between color charge densitites @xmath177 mediated by the color - coulomb kernel @xmath178 is invariant with respect to both @xmath100 and @xmath4 transformations .",
    "therefore such a term survives in an @xmath4-symmetric hadron .",
    "it is the term which arises from the longitudinal part of the color - electric yang - mills hamiltonian after resolving gauss law .",
    "however , the coupling of quarks to spatial gluons @xmath179 is not @xmath100- and @xmath4-symmetric and therefore its expectation value must vanish in the @xmath4-symmetric hadron wave function .",
    "the only interaction left is the color - coulomb part @xmath180 , eq .",
    "( [ inst ] ) .",
    "part of the interaction lagrangian represents the coulombic interaction coming from gauss law , while the spatial part is due to the interaction of the quark current with spatial gluons @xmath181 , where colour - magnetic contributions can occur . ]",
    "we conclude that after reduction of the quasi - zero modes the only interaction left in the system arises from the color - electric field components and there is no color - magnetic field contribution . in the untruncated case",
    "the color - magnetic field contribution is still there , but only through the quasi - zero modes .",
    "indeed , e.g. , the instanton fluctuations , which do lead the quasi - zero modes @xcite , do contain the magnetic field .",
    "the instantaneous color - coulomb potential , given as the expectation value of @xmath182 in the gluon sector , is confining @xcite and can be approximately obtained from the variational approach @xcite .",
    "the linear color - coulomb potential implies that lines of the colour - electric field are squeezed into a flux - tube .",
    "a flux - tube between static quark sources has been observed on the lattice , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the observed @xmath4 symmetry of hadrons after the low - mode elimination can be consequently connected to the existence of the _ dynamical _ qcd string and its energy @xcite .",

    "these results are straightforwardly generalized to @xmath162 massless flavors and the respective group is @xmath183 .",
