    "it has long been known that most of the deformed nuclei have prolate rather than oblate shapes  @xcite .",
    "this _ prolate - shape dominance _ is the subject of this paper , in which we examine the effects of several important factors to increase or decrease such preference for prolate shapes .    the properties of a nucleus are completely determined by the hamiltonian for quantum mechanical many - body systems consisting of nucleons .",
    "from this point of view , a possible direction of research for the origin of the prolate - shape dominance is to change artificially each term of the hamiltonian and examine its effect on the prolate - shape dominance .",
    "the most successful outcome of such a study would be a discovery of a direct correspondence between the prolate - shape dominance and a specific term of the elementary nucleon - nucleon interaction , in an analogous fashion as the tensor force causes a mixture of the @xmath0 wave in the wavefunction of a deuteron .",
    "however , nobody knows whether there exists such a simple relation .    in mean - field approximations",
    "all the influences of the many - body hamiltonian on the nuclear shape are conveyed through the mean - field ( one - body ) hamiltonian .",
    "hence , one can seek the origin of the prolate - shape dominance in the properties of the mean field , instead .",
    "if one also adopts the macroscopic - microscopic method  @xcite , which uses only the single - particle level density , one can determine the nuclear shape starting from the mean - field hamiltonian without referring to the underlying many - body hamiltonian .",
    "this is the choice of this paper .",
    "one can reasonably expect that the linkage from the mean - field hamiltonian to the nuclear shape may be simpler than those from the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , the former linkage has an established route to understand in terms of classical periodic orbits  @xcite , while the latter has none presently .",
    "we have been seeking the origin of the prolate - shape dominance in the one - body potentials in the macroscopic - microscopic framework . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employed the nilsson potential  @xcite and calculated the ratio of prolate - shape nuclei among @xmath11800 even - even nuclei as a function of the strengths of the @xmath2 term and the spin - orbit term .",
    "we found that the ratio of prolate nuclei oscillates versus the strength of the spin - orbit term when the @xmath2 term has the standard strength .",
    "this oscillation disappears when the @xmath2 potential is weaker .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is quite large .",
    "the ratio of prolate - shape nuclei oscillates between @xmath140% ( at @xmath340% strengths of the standard ) and @xmath480% ( at @xmath3100% and 0% strengths ) .",
    "this result indicates a strong interference between the effects of the two terms of the potential .",
    "however , this interference might be exaggerated because of the affinity of the two terms in the sense that both of them include the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2 term is an approximation to the radial profile of the central potential like a square well . in a letter",
    "@xcite , we replaced the nilsson potential with the woods - saxon ( ws ) potential to eliminate the @xmath2 potential . as a result",
    ", we still find the oscillation , although its amplitude was decreased by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "employment of the ws potential required various modifications of the method  @xcite .",
    "first , the ws potential has a continuum spectrum , which can not be treated by the standard strutinsky method .",
    "this problem was solved by the kruppa s prescription  @xcite to subtract the level density of the free - particle spectrum .",
    "concerning the remaining problem of the plateau condition , we invented the reference density method  @xcite to make the shell energy insensitive to the smearing width .",
    "second , the bcs equation with a constant pair - scattering matrix element @xmath7 also suffers from the continuum spectrum .",
    "we extended the kruppa s prescription to the paring to subtract the contributions from free - particle spectrum in the bcs equation .",
    "this treatment also improves the calculation of the nuclear radius  @xcite .",
    "third , available parameter sets of the ws potentials are not consistent with the macroscopic part especially for nuclei far from the @xmath8-stability line . we presented a method based on the thomas - fermi approximation to adjust the depth of the central potential to reproduce the drip lines predicted by the macroscopic energy .    in this paper ,",
    "we show and discuss the results of the calculations with the ws potential in much more detail than in the letter  @xcite .",
    "we try not a single but six parameter sets of the ws potential .",
    "we confirm the convergence of the results versus the size of the truncated oscillator basis for the diagonalization of the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "we show that different definitions of the ratio of prolate - shape nuclei do not change the conclusions .",
    "we also consider the effects of changing the strength of the pairing interaction , which we studied so far only for the nilsson potential in ref .",
    "we show the distribution of prolate and oblate nuclei in the nuclear chart for various modified potentials and confirm the independence of the main conclusions from the choice of potentials .    in the rest of the introduction , we survey the earlier works",
    ".    for the anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential , which is the most basic approximation to the one - nucleon potential , prolate ( oblate ) shapes tend to have lower energies than oblate ( prolate ) ones when the major shell is less ( more ) than half filled because the particles ( holes ) in the low @xmath9 orbitals drives strongly the nuclear shape toward prolate ( oblate ) direction . here , @xmath9 is the projection of the single - particle angular momentum onto the symmetry axis of the mean - field potential .",
    "this suggests an approximately equal number of prolate and oblate nuclei  @xcite .",
    "indeed , our quantitative estimation  @xcite showed that the ratio of prolate nuclei among deformed nuclei is 55% for a harmonic oscillator potential , while the experimental ratio of prolate nuclei seems much larger .    the earliest attempt to explain the prolate - shape preference is a work by lemmer and weisskopf  @xcite .",
    "a term @xmath10 was added to the harmonic oscillator potential to steepen the wall .",
    "then it overrode the normal tendency of the oscillator potential to deform into an oblate shape for a more - than - half - filled major shell .",
    "it suggests that the origin of the prolate - shape dominance is the radial profile of the potential .",
    "however , there was also an opinion that the origin is the spin - orbit potential .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite states that it is the spin - orbit potential which breaks the even situation by weakening the oblate - shape shell effect in @xmath11 shell nuclei .",
    "the truth has turned out  @xcite that both of the two salient features of the nuclear single - particle potential , the square - well like radial profile and the spin - orbit potential , play essential roles to give rise to the prolate - shape dominance .",
    "the dominance can be equally reproduced with and without the spin - orbit potential but it does not deny the participation of the spin - orbit potential , because half - strength spin - orbit potential destroys the dominance .",
    "the relation between potential and spectrum can be understood in terms of classical periodic orbits .",
    "putting aside the spin - orbit potential , frisk analyzed classical periodic orbits in an ellipsoidal cavity and found that the radial dependence is an origin of the prolate - shape dominance  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the shell effect at the fermi surface changes strongly in the prolate side while it stays almost constant in the oblate side as a function of the magnitude of deformation . as the classical periodic orbit responsible for this asymmetry between prolate and oblate shapes",
    ", frisk payed attention to a triangular orbit in the meridian plane whose period changes little in the oblate side owing to the volume conservation condition .",
    "arita used a power - law potential @xmath12  @xcite , which can interpolate continuously between the square - well potential and the harmonic oscillator potentials , for the same kind of analysis and obtained essentially the same conclusion as frisk  @xcite . concerning the classical periodic orbits responsible for the prolate - shape dominance",
    ", arita insisted the importance of bridge - orbit bifurcations .",
    "he is also planning to treat the spin - orbit potential in the periodic orbit theory  @xcite .",
    "hamamoto and mottelson presented a plain explanation to the fact that the level density in the fermi level changes little in the oblate side  @xcite . in the nilsson diagram of single - particle spectrum , the degenerated levels belonging to a subshell at spherical shape fans out ( spreads ) versus increasing magnitude of deformation in both prolate and oblate sides",
    "however , this fanning out is small for levels with low @xmath13 ( the projection of orbital angular momentum onto the symmetry axis ) in the oblate side because they are pushed down by many orbitals with the same quantum number belonging to upper major shells .",
    "since the same spectrum leads to the same value of the shell effect , no energy can be gained by deforming into oblate shapes .",
    "however , arita  @xcite found a counterexample to this explanation .",
    "for a low - power potential @xmath14 , the fanning is suppressed for low-@xmath13 orbitals in _ prolate _ shapes , while he found no _ oblate_-shape dominance .",
    "therefore , the explanation in terms of fanning applies indeed to nuclear - like potentials but probably not to different types of potentials .",
    "we think that the reason for this limitation is that the explanation in terms of the fanning mechanism does not explicitly consider the volume conservation condition which played an essential role in frisk s argument  @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention two other factors which have minor effects to prefer prolate shapes .",
    "one is the coulomb interaction , which tends to elongate the nuclear shape rather than flatten it in order to diminish positive electrostatic potential energy between protons .",
    "however , this effect does not seem to play a decisive role to give rise to the prolate - shape dominance because it increases as @xmath15 and is strongest in heavy nuclei while the actual dominance is already very clear in middle - weight nuclei .",
    "this effect will be revisited in our future paper for more detailed studies .",
    "the other is the angular - momentum projection of mean - field solutions into zero or low - spin spin states , which has a tendency to lower the energy of prolate states relative to that of oblate ones , because the former have generally larger moments of inertia than the latter . this effect seems to have already been argued by zickendraht  @xcite as the difference of the volume element for the collective coordinates between prolate and oblate shapes , which is originated in the difference of the available configuration space in the spherical shell model .",
    "however , mean - field models and their phenomenological interactions are determined to reproduce the experiments without angular momentum projection and thus it is widely believed that they includes the effects of the projection . a quantitative examination of this belief will be a subject of our future study .    in sec .",

    "<S> we study the prolate - shape predominance of the nuclear ground - state deformation by calculating the masses of more than two thousand even - even nuclei using the strutinsky method , modified by kruppa , and improved by us . </S>",
    "<S> the influences of the surface thickness of the single - particle potentials , the strength of the spin - orbit potential , and the pairing correlations are investigated by varying the parameters of the woods - saxon potential and the pairing interaction . the strong interference between the effects of the surface thickness and the spin - orbit potential is confirmed to persist for six sets of the woods - saxon potential parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the observed behavior of the ratios of prolate , oblate , and spherical nuclei versus potential parameters are rather different in different mass regions . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the ratio of spherical nuclei increases for weakly bound unstable nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> differences of the results from the calculations with the nilsson potential are described in detail . </S>"
