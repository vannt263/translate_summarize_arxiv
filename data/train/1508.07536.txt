    "inspired by the successes of @xmath5-minimality @xcite in real algebraic geometry , haskell and macpherson @xcite set out to create a @xmath6-adic counterpart , a project which resulted in the notion of @xmath0-minimality .",
    "one of their achievements was to build a theory of dimension for definable sets which is in many ways similar to the @xmath5-minimal case .",
    "still , some questions remained open .",
    "the theorem below is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "it gives a positive answer to one of the questions raised at the end of their paper ( problem 7.5 ) .",
    "we will assume @xmath7 to be a @xmath0-minimal expansion of a @xmath6-adically closed field with value group @xmath8 .",
    "when we say definable , we mean definable ( with parameters ) in a @xmath0-minimal structure .",
    "every definable function @xmath9 with domain @xmath10 and values in @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) is continuous on a definable set @xmath13 which is dense and open in @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "haskell and macpherson already included a slightly weaker version of the above result in remark  5.5 of their paper @xcite , under the additional assumption that @xmath7 has definable skolem functions .",
    "however , they only gave a sketch of the proof , leaving out some details which turned out to be more subtle than expected .",
    "the authors agreed with us that some statements in the original proof required further clarification .",
    "one of the motivations for writing this paper was to remedy this , and also to show that the assumption of skolem functions could be removed .",
    "this seemed worthwhile given that the result had already proven to be a useful tool for deducing other properties about the dimension of definable sets in @xmath0-minimal structures .",
    "for example , in @xcite one of the authors showed how the quasi - continuity theorem would imply the next result .",
    "let @xmath2 be a non - empty definable subset of @xmath16 .",
    "then it holds that @xmath17 .",
    "that both theorems are very much related is further illustrated by the approach in this paper : we will first prove the small boundaries property , and use it to derive the quasi - continuity property .",
    "the tool used to prove these results is a ` topological cell decomposition ' , which we consider to be the second main result of this paper .    for every definable function @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) there exists a good t - cell decomposition @xmath18 of @xmath14 , such that for every @xmath19 , the restriction @xmath20 of @xmath9 to @xmath2 is continuous .",
    "the notions of ` t - cell ' and ` good t - cell decomposition ' were originally introduced by mathews , whose paper @xcite has been a major source of inspiration for us .",
    "they are analogous to a classical notion of cells coming from real algebraic geometry ( see for example the definition of cells in @xcite ) .",
    "exact definitions will be given in the next section .",
    "+   + by now , there exist many cell decomposition results for p - minimal structures , which can be quite different in flavour , depending on their aims and intended level of generality .",
    "historically , the most influential result is probably denef s cell decompositon for semi - algebraic sets @xcite ( which in turn was inspired by cohen s work @xcite ) .",
    "this has inspired adaptations to the sub - analytic context by cluckers @xcite , and to multi - sorted semi - algebraic structures by pas @xcite .",
    "results like @xcite give generalizations of denef - style cell decomposition . note that full generality is hard to achieve : whereas @xcite works for all @xmath6-minimal structures without restriction , it is somewhat weaker than these more specialized results . on the other hand , @xcite are closer to the results cited above , but require some restrictions on the class of @xmath0-minimal fields under consideration .",
    "a somewhat different result is the cluckers - loeser cell decomposition @xcite for @xmath21-minimal structures .",
    "each of these decompositions has its own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the topological cell decomposition proposed here seems to be the best for our purposes , since it is powerful enough to fill the remaining lacunas in the dimension theory of definable sets over @xmath0-minimal fields , without restriction .",
    "the rest of this paper will be organized as follows . in section  [",
    "se : notation ] , we recall some definitions and known results , and we set the notation for the remaining sections . in section  [",
    "se : cell - dec ] , we will prove the t - cell decomposition theorem ( theorem  [ th : m - cell - prep ] ) and deduce the small boundaries property ( theorem  [ th : dim - boundary ] ) as a corollary .",
    "finally , in section  [ se : pure - dim ] , we prove the quasi - continuity property ( theorem  [ th : dense - cont ] ) . the key ingredient of this proof is the following result ( see theorem  [ th : dense - int ] ) , which is also interesting in its own right .",
    "let @xmath22 be a family of definable subsets of @xmath16 .",
    "if the union of the @xmath23 s has non empty interior in @xmath2 then at least one of them has non empty interior in @xmath2 .",
    "note that the above statement shows that , if @xmath24 are definable subsets which are dense in @xmath2 , then their intersection @xmath25 will also be dense in @xmath2 . indeed , a definable subset is dense in @xmath2 if and only if its complement in @xmath2 has empty interior inside @xmath2 .

    "+   + the notion of dimension used by haskell and macpherson in @xcite ( which they denoted as @xmath77 ) is defined as follows :    [ def : dimension ] the * dimension * of a set @xmath78 ( denoted as @xmath79 ) is the maximal integer @xmath80 for which there exists a subset @xmath56 of @xmath81 such that @xmath82 has non - empty interior in @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85 with @xmath86 an enumeration of @xmath56 .",
    "we will omit the super - index @xmath64 in @xmath87 when it is clear from the context , and put @xmath88 .",

    "also , @xmath94 if and only if @xmath2 has non - empty interior .",
    "+   + let us now recall some of the properties of this dimension that were already proven by haskell and macpherson in @xcite :    _ _    ( hm@xmath95 ) : :    given definable sets @xmath96 , it    holds that @xmath97 .",
