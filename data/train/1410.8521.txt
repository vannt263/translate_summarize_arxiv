    "betweenness centrality @xmath1 is a graph theoretic measure of how often a node @xmath2 is on a shortest path of links between any pair of nodes @xcite .",
    "ubiquitously @xmath3 where the sum requires @xmath4 : @xmath5 is the total number of shortest paths that join @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 gives the number of those geodesics that pass through @xmath2 .",
    "intuitively , nodes with high betweenness can be thought of as decisive for the functionality of decentralized communication networks , since they typically route more data packets ( based on the assumption that traffic tries to follow only the shortest available multi - hop paths ) .",
    "this notion of importance is in sharp contrast to traditional methods , which simply enumerate node degrees : a bridging node which connects two large clusters is , for example , of crucial importance to the whole network , even though it may only have two neighbours ; this sort of information is brought out by @xmath9 , but usually goes undetected .    in router - based communication networks ,",
    "the router itself has a normalised betweenness of unity , since all nodes connect to it directly , while all other nodes have a centrality of zero .",
    "a promising focus in physical layer network design today is , however , on an entirely different network philosophy , where there is no router @xcite .",
    "these structures are known as wireless ad hoc ( or sometimes ` relay ' ) networks , where packets of information are routed in a multi - hop fashion between any two nodes that wish to communicate , allowing much larger , more flexible networks ( due to the lack of pre - established infrastructure or the need to be within range of a switch ) .",
    "_ networks are nowadays realised under wi - fi direct standards , enabling device - to - device ( d2d ) offloading in lte cellular networks @xcite .",
    "this new diversity in machine betweenness can be harnessed in at least three separate ways : historically , in 2005 gupta _",
    "@xcite used @xmath9 as a criteria for electing cluster head nodes which communicate to base - stations on behalf of all the cooperating machines , and later , in 2010 ercsey - ravasz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated how betweenness can be used to delineate the ` vulnerability backbone ' of a network ( a percolating cluster of the highest @xmath9 nodes ) , which is important for defense purposes @xcite .",
    "finally , in 2006 , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite researched the use of betweenness for boundary detection ( since at high node density @xmath10 the betweenness of machines exhibits a bi - modal behaviour and can therefore elucidate boundary location ) . since the principal model for _ ad hoc _ networks has become the random geometric graph @xcite ( consisting of a set of nodes placed randomly in some domain @xmath11 , mutually coupled using a connection law based on their euclidean separation ) , in this paper we begin to develop an understanding of how the expected betweenness of a node at some domain location changes with the parameters of the random graph model , evaluating analytic formulas for @xmath9 as a function of domain position .",
    "we start our derivation with the disk domain @xmath12 of radius @xmath13 ( left panel , fig .",
    "1 ) , considering the limiting scenario of infinite node density with a vanishing node - to - node connection range .",
    "we will then argue that betweenness , a computationally heavy operation with possibly high communication overheads , can be well approximated by our analytical closed form predictions and can therefore prove useful in practice .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section ii we present our basic network model and state our main assumptions . in section iii",
    "we introduce an analytic formula for @xmath14 in the continuum limit ( where the node density @xmath15 ) , which is our main result . in section",
    "iv we present monte carlo simulations which validate our predictions , in section v we discuss the applicability of the derived betweenness centrality formula within _ ad hoc _ wireless networks and conclude in section vi , discussing the impact of our contribution and possible future research directions .    : if we consider the three general positions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( corresponding to the positions of the respective nodes @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 ) , we have the scalar @xmath19 representing the distance of @xmath2 to the line joining @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the axis",
    "are centred on the node @xmath2 , while the circle is centred at @xmath20 . ]",
    "consider @xmath21 nodes placed inside a bounded , convex subset @xmath11 of volume @xmath22 ( using the lebesgue measure ) according to a uniform point process of density @xmath23 at positions @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( at @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) possess euclidean separation @xmath27 and are connected ( through a ` link ' ) with probability @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is a constant determining the typical node - to - node connection range @xcite ) . this connection function helps to model the fact that over a wireless channel with rayleigh fading @xcite , the complement of the information outage probability between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays exponentially with the distance @xmath27 raised to some power , the path loss exponent , which we set here equal to 2 since we consider only free - space propagation @xcite .",
    "the resulting random graph is called ` soft ' due to the probabilistic connection law @xcite , a generalisation of the more common ` hard ' unit disk graphs where the connection function is the indicator of a ball centred at the origin @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will be interested in the expected betweenness centrality of some node @xmath2 found at position @xmath30 in a network formed under the above assumptions inside a disk domain @xmath12 .",
    "for the sake of mathematical tractability and in order to approximate a dense network , we consider only the continuum limit @xmath15 , where the connection range vanishes ( which is realistic in the dense regime ) such that @xmath31 ; this scenario mimics a connected graph where all nodes on any straight line between any two points lie on the shortest path that links the two respective endpoint nodes .",
    "we therefore seek the continuum analogue of eq .",
    "( [ e:1 ] ) . considering the probability @xmath32 that some node is placed at position @xmath16 in @xmath33",
    ", we have the probability @xmath34 that ( any ) node pair will simultaneously be placed at @xmath35 and construct between itself a shortest path which passes through @xmath2 , since the characteristic function @xmath36 equates to unity whenever @xmath2 lies on the path @xmath37 ( given by the straight line segment @xmath38 that joins @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , and is otherwise zero .",
    "summing this up over all possible @xmath35 pair locations within the domain gives the expected betweenness centrality of @xmath2 for a random node configuration in @xmath33 as @xmath15 : @xmath39 where we take @xmath40 and thus @xmath41 .",
    "note also that due to the symmetry of @xmath12 , we describe the position of the node @xmath2 by its euclidean distance @xmath42 from the disk s centre .",
    "now consider fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , where we define the scalar @xmath19 as the distance of @xmath2 from the straight line @xmath38 . defining the delta function @xmath43",
    ", we then suggest that @xmath44 the delta function will only contribute to the integral of eq .",
    "( [ e:4 ] ) when its argument @xmath45 is a zero of @xmath46 .",
    "as such , if we then describe @xmath45 such that it has a unique zero whenever @xmath2 lies on the path @xmath37 , integrating @xmath47 over the space of all node pairs @xmath35 should return @xmath48 as required .",
    "1 shows @xmath2 located a distance @xmath42 from the centre of @xmath12 , with the coordinate system centred on @xmath2 and orientated such that the disk centre is at @xmath49 .",
    "considering nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 at distances @xmath50 and @xmath51 from @xmath2 respectively , we have that the internal angles @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 sum to @xmath55 . the perpendicular distance @xmath56 from @xmath2 to the line @xmath38 then satisfies both @xmath57 and @xmath58 adding the above and taking small angle approximations ( since we are interested in the case where @xmath59 ) we have that @xmath60 whenever @xmath61 .",
    "this approximation presents a unique zero of @xmath19 whenever @xmath62 , allowing@xmath63 due to the trivial scaling laws of the delta function .",
    "( [ e:4 ] ) , a double volume integral , becomes a quadruple integral @xmath64",
    "taking @xmath65 , the polar equation of the circle bounding @xmath12 , we have @xmath66 integrating the delta function , we have @xmath67 leaving @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind ( which is related to the perimeter of an ellipse @xcite ) .",
    "we normalise this to @xmath70 by dividing eq .",
    "( [ e:10 ] ) by its maximum value ( such that @xmath71 ) to obtain our main result @xmath72 with @xmath42 in units of @xmath13 ( and with the betweenness now an element of the unit interval ) .",
    "elliptic integrals can not be swiftly visualised , so for clarification we can expand eq .",

    "respectively ) with eq .",
    "( [ e:12 ] ) the thicker line at the top ( taking @xmath79 ) .",
    "the finite density curves approach the limit @xmath80 as @xmath15 .",
    "we sample @xmath81 random graphs . ]",
    "[ fig : two ] ( top left graphic ) shows that the betweenness @xmath1 of nodes situated in the bulk of the disk is typically high . binning the centrality in small increments of displacement from the centre of @xmath12 and averaging over many network realizations",
    ", we can plot the expectation @xmath14 , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] , demonstrating how @xmath82 at finite densities approaches our continuum approximation . in these simulations",
    "we take @xmath29 to be the largest value required for full network connectivity @xcite , and increase @xmath10 from @xmath83 to @xmath78 , each time evaluating the betweenness using brandes algorithm @xcite .",
    "we observe that the continuum prediction is slowly reached by our numerical simulations , with only small discrepancies .",
    "quantifying the rate of convergence as well as the nature of these discrepancies is beyond the scope of this paper and is deferred to future work .",
    "by estimating betweenness based on domain location using eq .",
    "( [ e:12 ] ) , nodes avoid the costly operation of repeated centrality computation throughout the network s battery - limited lifetime . at the moment ,",
    "single or two - hop neighbourhood information is used in place of betweenness metrics , entirely due to the impracticality of its computation @xcite .",
    "this allows a range of novel , sophisticated features to be employed in future dense _",
    "ad hoc _ networks , which we now discuss in more detail .      in order to minimise energy consumption , _ ad hoc _ networks commonly group nodes into local clusters ( usually defined by their inter - cluster hop distance ) and",
    "elect a ` cluster head node ' for each partition @xcite .",
    "the cluster head node ( ch ) then transmits to the distant base station ( bs ) on behalf of its cluster , which reportedly reduces total energy consumption by ( up to ) a factor of @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the betweenness measure has been used for these purposes @xcite , and a number of cluster routing protocols are usually implemented .",
    "for example , the basic leach ( low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy @xcite ) protocol uses a random selection of cluster heads at each ` round ' or time - step , the nodes each taking turns in bearing the burden of cloud - access ( or backhaul gateway ) status , or , alternatively , eecs ( energy efficient clustering scheme @xcite ) , which requires nodes to broadcast their remaining power to their first - degree neighbours , asking machines that find themselves with the most battery power amongst their one - hop partners to then elect themselves to ch status .",
    "however , in large networks using a vanishing transmitter range these protocols do nt work : far too many cluster heads get elected due to the huge node numbers and the efficiency problem that this technique is trying to mitigate re - arises . potentially increasing",
    "transmitter range could resolve the problem ( since the usual techniques are based on one - hop access to the head node ) , though this introduces interference problems , forcing the search for another solution .",
    "betweenness is a possible alternative election criteria ( where the network is considered a single connected cluster ) since it is proportional to power consumption ( due to the expected increase in routing load , unlike most other centrality measures ) , allowing idle boundary nodes to act as cluster heads whenever power minimisation is preferred , or busy domain - center nodes whenever optimisation of node - to - node communication overheads is tasked . knowledge of betweenness as a function of position helps in the selection of positions which , when occupied by nodes , results in ch election . in static networks",
    "this requires increasing battery resources for these stations ; in mobile networks this allows nodes to use their position to trigger bs contact ( perhaps at for @xmath85 ) , perhaps using gps facilities or even through measuring there current routing load .",
    "note also that , based on the intuition `` central nodes are easier to reach '' , communication - based resource consumption is minimised whenever high - betweenness nodes are , in general , used as cluster heads .",
    "( [ e:12 ] ) gives a surface whose minimum points indicate corners , edges ( and potentially faces ) of the domain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) .",
    "boundary detection is an important field in _ ad hoc _ network engineering , with various applications @xcite .",
    "one potential use of betweenness as a boundary detector is for mitigation of the so called boundary effect phenomenon @xcite , where high - density network connectivity is hampered through nodes becoming isolated near the domain peripheries due to a loss of the usually available full solid angle for transmission in the relevant domain dimension .",
    "one potential mitigation technique is to increase the node transmit power at the domain boundary : by potentially using a typical node - to - node connection range @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath29 is a function of @xmath42 @xmath88 we can harness some spare power in the relatively idle boundary nodes ( detected using eq .",
    "( [ e:12 ] ) ) , increasing machine transmit power appropriately with betweenness .",
    "this does not require the sharing of routing tables or other connectivity information , since betweenness is directly proportional to the node s current routing tasks .",
    "finding the optimal function of the betweenness ( or perhaps other centrality measures ) is beyond the scope of this paper , and we defer its treatment to a later study .",
    "as wireless devices and sensors become smarter , statistical methods involving low communication overheads are increasingly being developed and implemented to improve network performance . in this paper",
    "we have revisited the graph theoretic concept of betweenness centrality , a measure of how many shortest paths run through a given node , and have evaluated it in closed form in an infinitely dense random geometric network bounded inside a disk .",
    "of course , nodes near the centre of the domain typically have more shortest paths running though them , and hence display a higher betweenness centrality , while nodes near the edge of the domain are typically used less and hence have a lower betweenness .",
    "the quantitative formula ( [ e:12 ] ) presented herein , however , not only described in detail this behaviour but can also be used _",
    "inter alia _ for cluster head election and boundary detection within a network well modelled by a random graph ( such as an ad hoc network , as discussed in the text ) .",
    "the above motivates further investigations into the use of betweenness centrality in smart wireless communications under relaxed limits e.g. finite density and/or other connection models e.g. the unit disk scenario .",
    "significantly , we next intend to focus on understanding features unique in non - convex domains , illustrated ( for example ) in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , where shortest paths typically route round central obstacles : this would constitute a move toward a complete analytic understanding of betweenness centrality in random geometric networks , of importance to the engineering and mathematics communities alike .",
