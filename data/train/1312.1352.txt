    "the eclipsing binary aqser  ( gsc  00340 - 00588 , bd+03  3015 , @xmath6 ) was discovered as a variable star by @xcite . its correct period of 1.6874 days and eclipse ephemeris were determined much later by @xcite .",
    "the light curve shows relatively deep ( 0.6 mag ) and nearly identical primary and secondary eclipses , and the spectral types of the stars have been reported as f5 and a2 @xcite , although the latter classification for the less massive star is probably too early .",
    "the system has been little studied since its discovery , other than the occasional measurement of times of eclipse .",
    "the main motivation for this work is to present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of aqser , with which we determine for the first time accurate absolute dimensions for the system and establish the evolutionary status of the stars .",
    "both components appear to be at the very end of their hydrogen - burning phase , a location of the h - r diagram in which only a few other well - measured eclipsing binaries are found .",
    "the predicted properties of such stars from stellar evolution theory are especially sensitive to the degree of convective core overshooting adopted in the models , and a previous study by @xcite has highlighted the difficulties that current models appear to have in reproducing the stellar properties of both components at a single age .",
    "the newly determined absolute dimensions for aqser  allow us an opportunity to revisit this problem here .",
    "photometric measurements of aqser  were determined by two different and independent robotic observatories : the ursa webscope , and the nfo webscope .",
    "the ursa webscope uses a 10-inch meade lx200 sct telescope with an sbig st8 ccd camera , housed in a technical innovations robodome on the roof of the kimpel hall on the university of arkansas campus at fayetteville , and is controlled by an apple macintosh g4 computer in a nearby control room .",
    "the field of view is about 20@xmath730 arc minutes .",
    "observations with a bessel @xmath8 filter were carried out from 2003 june to 2011 july , producing a total of 8642 science frames from 80-second exposures .",
    "the two comparison stars for aqser  ( ` var ' ) , both within 8 arc minutes of the variable star , were gsc  00340 - 00252 ( ` comp ' ; @xmath9 , ) and gsc  00341 - 00211 ( ` ck ' ; @xmath10 , ) .",
    "it was eventually found that the ck star is a low - amplitude variable with a sinusoidal variation of half - amplitude 0.017 mag and a period of about four years .",
    "differential magnitudes in this study were therefore based on the var@xmath11comp magnitudes only .",
    "the nfo webscope is located near silver city ( nm ) in a roll - off roof structure , and consists of a 24-inch cassegrain reflector with a field - widening correcting lens near the focus ( see * ? ? ?",
    "at the focus is a camera based on the kodak kaf-4301e ccd chip , with a field of view of about 27@xmath727 arc minutes .",
    "aqser  was observed at the nfo between 2005 january and 2007 june , producing a total of 6694 observations from 80-second exposures with a bessel @xmath8 filter .",
    "all images were measured using a computer application ( measure ) that matched a pattern file with the image , and then determined the differential magnitude after correction for dark current , sky brightness , and responsivity variations across the field of view .    as we have noted in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the telescopes we used in this study produce systematic shifts of a few hundredths of a magnitude in the photometric zero point from night to night , and in the case of the nfo webscope , from one side of the german equatorial mount axis to the other .",
    "the shifts are very much less for the ursa webscope than for the nfo , which shows that this is an effect of the optical system being used , and is not intrinsic to the stars themselves .",
    "the offsets are due to a non - uniform responsivity across the field of view , combined with imprecise centering from night to night . in the case of the nfo , we removed most of this effect by using dithered exposures of open clusters to fit a 2-d polynomial function to the responsivity variations , resulting in a photometric flat that is included in the initial data reduction procedures .",
    "residual offsets remaining after this process were then removed by using an initial photometric orbital fit model ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : lcanalysis ] ) to determine the values of the nightly offsets and to remove them from the data . in this case , 130 nightly shifts were removed from the ursa data , and 197 shifts were removed from the nfo data .",
    "the typical precision of the final aqser  data sets is about 9 mmag for ursa and 5 mmag for nfo .",
    "the measurements including nightly corrections are listed in table  [ tab : ursa ] ( ursa ) and table  [ tab : nfo ] ( nfo ) .",

    "we obtained @xmath21 , formally indicating that the cooler and more massive star of the system is visually the brightest .",
    "as in previous studies using similar spectroscopic material , we made an assessment of potential systematic errors in our radial velocities that may result from residual line blending as well as lines shifting in and out of our narrow spectral window as a function of orbital phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we did this by performing numerical simulations analogous to those described by @xcite , and we applied corrections to the raw velocities based on these simulations to mitigate the effect .",
    "the corrections were typically less than 2.5  kms@xmath13  for the hotter star and less than 2  kms@xmath13  for the cooler star , which are smaller than our internal velocity errors ( @xmath225  kms@xmath13 ) .",
    "the effect of these corrections on the absolute masses is minimal .",
    "finally , the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by taking nightly exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small run - to - run corrections ( typically under 1  kms@xmath13 ) were applied to the velocities as described by @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we will assume that the extra mixing comes only from overshooting from the core , which is the way the effect is most commonly described in current models .",
    "the prescriptions for this vary from model to model , and in general the treatment is still very much ad hoc .",
    "we begin by considering the granada evolutionary models of @xcite , in which the overshoot length is taken to be @xmath335 , where @xmath336 is the local pressure scale height at or across the formal edge of the convective core .",
    "figure  [ fig : granada ] shows the evolutionary tracks for the measured masses of aqser , and a range of overshooting parameters ( assumed to be the same for the two stars ) from @xmath337 ( no overshooting ) to 0.30 . for models with no overshooting the best match to the temperatures was found for a metallicity of @xmath338 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath281 } = -0.20 $ ] in these models , which is very close to our photometric estimate for the system .",
    "however , the fit places both stars in the hertzprung gap , which is a very rapid and a priori unlikely state of evolution .",
    "furthermore , the models predict the more massive star ( filled circle ) to be the hotter one , which is the opposite of what we observe .",
    "better agreement with the measured temperature difference would require nearly identical masses ( to well within 1% ; see below ) , while our spectroscopic analysis shows them to differ by about 5% ( table  [ tab : sborbit ] ) .",
    "the measured mass ratio is therefore inconsistent with a post - main - sequence status for aqser , and this argues for a significant amount of extra mixing .",
    "indeed , only when the overshooting parameter reaches a value near @xmath339 is it possible to obtain a better match to the temperature difference at this metallicity ( figure  [ fig : granada ] , bottom panel ) , and this places the stars at the very end of the main - sequence phase .",
    "even this fit is unsatisfactory , however , as the models predict different ages for stars of these masses and radii , with the more massive one appearing younger .",
    "we explored this further by considering other published series of stellar evolution calculations , although in this case the overshooting parameter is generally fixed at a value chosen by the modelers and can not be changed by the user . in the yonsei - yale calculations by @xcite overshooting",
    "is treated in the same way as the granada models , and the multiplicative factor @xmath340 ramps up gradually from zero for stars with no convective core to a maximum of 0.20 as the mass increases ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is a function of metallicity . for models with solar metallicity",
    "the mass interval over which the overshooting parameter rises from @xmath341 to 0.20 is 1.21.4@xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath16 vs.  @xmath227 diagram in the top panel of figure  [ fig : yale ] shows the measurements of aqser  compared against yonsei - yale evolutionary tracks ( solid lines ) for the measured masses of the components .",
    "the metallicity in the models has been adjusted to a value of @xmath342 ( or @xmath281 } = -0.22 $ ] , similar to the value inferred using the granada models ) that gives the best fit with the stars just past the point of hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "the corresponding @xmath340 values for these masses are approximately 0.20 for the cooler and more massive star and 0.12 for the other .",
    "the best - fit isochrone has an age of 3.0  gyr , and as before , the fit places the stars in the hertzprung gap .",
    "however , once again there is a problem with the masses .",
    "evolution is such a strong function of mass at these phases that in order to be so close together in this part of the diagram the yonsei - yale models require stars of this average mass to have virtually identical masses ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "this is in strong disagreement with the measured mass ratio ( @xmath344 ) at the 4.6@xmath345 level , and excludes such an evolved state .",
    "instead the stars must still be on the main sequence if they are to have the same age , and this implies there must be a significant degree of extra mixing .",
    "we illustrate the mass disagreement in the figure in another way by marking the expected location of the two stars on the best - fit isochrone at their measured masses .",
    "theory predicts them to be much farther apart in @xmath14 and @xmath16 than observed .    an equivalent way of interpreting the discrepancy is in terms of age , as noted earlier .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : yale ] show the predictions from the yonsei - yale models for the radius and temperature as a function of mass , along with isochrones for a range of ages .",
    "the more massive star is better fit at a younger age than the secondary , the difference being about 0.45  gyr ( or 15% ) , as seen more clearly in the mass / radius plane .",
    "isochrones in this diagram are mostly vertical for stars of this size , so the significance of the age difference depends largely on the mass separation .",
    "the mass uncertainties shown by the shaded boxes represent _ total _ errors ; the error in the mass _ difference _ , @xmath346 , is considerably smaller and is also indicated in the figure .",
    "therefore , the age discrepancy is highly significant .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : absdim ] , aqser  lacks a spectroscopic determination of [ fe / h ] and only a photometric estimate is available . while the model comparisons above suggest a metallicity fairly close to that estimate , the solutions are not unique .",
    "we find that it is possible to obtain similarly good fits for somewhat lower values of [ fe / h ] , with the stars being at the end of the main - sequence phase rather than past the `` blue hook '' .",
    "we illustrate this with a third set of models from the victoria - regina series @xcite .",
    "these calculations use a different description of overshooting based on a parametrized version of the roxburgh criterion @xcite , in which the effect is assumed to ramp up between masses of 1.15 and 1.70@xmath180 for compositions near solar .",
    "figure  [ fig : victoria ] ( top ) shows a best - fit isochrone in the @xmath16 vs.  @xmath14 diagram that places the stars in the hertzprung gap , but as before it requires a mass ratio very near unity ( @xmath347 ) at odds with the measured value at the 4.8@xmath345 level .",
    "this best fit corresponds to an age of 2.9 gyr and @xmath348 } = -0.20 $ ] . in the bottom panel",
    "an equally good fit is achieved for an age of 2.3 gyr and @xmath281 } = -0.30 $ ] that accommodates the stars on the main sequence with the degree of overshooting prescribed in the models . however , even here theory would require the masses to be nearly the same ( @xmath349 ) to satisfy the age constraint , which is still in disagreement with the spectroscopic value at the 3.4@xmath345 level . perhaps as importantly , the measured radii or temperatures are not reproduced at the measured masses ( see figure  [ fig : victoria ] ) .",
    "the ages required to match them are again younger for the more massive component , by about the same amount as in the post - main - sequence solution .",
    "a similar exercise with the parsec models from the padova group @xcite , which employ yet another prescription for overshooting , again allows two qualitatively different solutions .",
    "the post - main - sequence scenario strongly disagrees with the measured mass ratio , and a lower metallicity scenario ( @xmath350 , or @xmath348 } = -0.25 $ ] for @xmath351 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the stars at the end of the main - sequence still requires a mass ratio of @xmath352 that is lower than our spectroscopic result at the 3.5@xmath345 level .",
    "thus , all models seem to fail to match the observations for aqser  at a single age , pointing to a fundamental problem with theory likely related to overshooting .",
    "the most common way in which the degree of overshooting has been calibrated in stellar evolution models is by means of star clusters , and in particular through the comparison of isochrones to the blue - hook region in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the drawbacks are that this can be affected by contamination of the cmd by field stars , unresolved binary systems , or variable stars , by uncertainties in the chemical composition of the cluster , and even by systematics from the color / temperature transformations .",
    "furthermore , the main property of stars  their absolute mass  is generally not known for any object along the cmd of the clusters most frequently used for this type of comparison .",
    "an alternate way of calibrating @xmath353 is by means of eclipsing binary systems , where masses and radii are precisely known ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this method the latter authors found a relatively strong mass ( and possibly metallicity ) dependence of overshooting for stars in the 212@xmath180 range , although subsequent studies reported the mass dependence to be less pronounced and more uncertain @xcite .",
    "the special location of aqser  in the h - r diagram makes it a uniquely sensitive test of convective core overshooting in current models of stellar evolution . as shown above",
    ", the measured mass ratio is different enough from unity that stars with radii and temperatures as similar as they are in this system can not possibly be in the post - main - sequence phase .",
    "this constitutes clear evidence that mixing beyond the core ( overshooting ) is required . while early support for the need of extra mixing was shown nearly 25 years ago by @xcite from the inordinately large number of b- and a - type eclipsing systems that appeared to be in the hertzprung gap , the present system represents a particularly compelling demonstration .",
    "however , aqser  shows an additional problem , which is that even with the inclusion of overshooting and the freedom to adjust the metallicity in the models so as to accommodate the stars at the very end of the main - sequence phase , current calculations are still unable to match the well measured radius and temperature difference at the measured masses .",
    "theory requires the stars to have masses much more similar to each other ( @xmath354 ) than they are observed to be ( @xmath355 ) , a difference that seems beyond reasonable observational uncertainties .",
    "this problem manifests itself also as an age discrepancy when attempting to fit models to each component separately : the more massive star appears systematically younger .",
    "our comparisons in the previous section indicate that this difficulty is common to all models ( and the age difference does not change much compared to the alternate post - main - sequence fit ) : the age difference is about 0.5 gyr for the granada models , 0.45 gyr for the yonsei - yale models , 0.30 gyr for the victoria - regina models , and 0.40 gyr for the padova models , all corresponding to 1015% of the mean evolutionary age of the binary .",
    "experiments with the granada models in which we varied not only @xmath340 but also the mixing length parameter @xmath356 independently for each star , for different trial values of @xmath357 , gave mean ages ranging from 3.1 to 3.5  gyr , but did not improve the situation regarding the age difference .",
    "we consistently found the predicted age for the more massive star to be younger than the other component .",
    "similar age discrepancies in the same direction as we see were pointed out by @xcite for several other well - measured f - type eclipsing systems with unequal masses in the range from 1.15 to 1.70@xmath180 .",
    "this is roughly the interval in which the models ramp up the strength of the overshooting , and is also approximately the mass range in which stars transition from having their energy production dominated by the p - p chain to the cno cycle .",
    "the four systems studied by @xcite for which age differences were noted are gxgem , bwaqr , v442cyg , and bkpeg . of these , the first is the most similar to aqser  in terms of its evolutionary state .",
    "it is located just prior to the blue hook in the h - r diagram according to the models , although the component masses are more similar to each other than those in the aqser  system , so the age difference is less significant .",
    "two other systems studied by us more recently are also quite near the end of the main sequence : coand @xcite and bfdra @xcite .",
    "although age anomalies were not mentioned in the original investigations of these binaries , a closer examination shows that both systems display age discrepancies similar to those seen previously , with the more massive component appearing younger . for coand",
    "the age difference is about 0.3  gyr ( 8% ) , and for bfdra it is only @xmath220.1  gyr ( 4% ) , but still in the same direction .",
    "it is clear from these observations that a serious deficiency has been uncovered in current stellar evolution models for this mass range , which has not previously received much attention beyond the work of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mrdiagram ] shows the location in the mass / radius diagram of all well - measured eclipsing binary systems studied by @xcite , as well as others from @xcite having both components in the 1.151.70@xmath180 range . to these we added coand , bfdra , and aqser .",
    "the shaded area represents the region of the blue hook for solar composition , according to the yonsei - yale models , and an increase in the overshooting parameter would shift this region upward .",
    "aqser  is seen to be the most evolved system in this mass range , which perhaps explains the larger age discrepancy noted earlier .",
    "given that overshooting has a direct impact on evolution timescales , particularly for main - sequence stars in the more advanced stages , it is natural to suspect that the simplified treatment of this phenomenon in current models has something to do with their difficulty in matching the measured properties of binaries at a single age .",
    "however , from our tests with aqser  the explanation does not appear to be a simple difference in @xmath340 for the two components , and may be more complex , involving , e.g. , a dependence of overshooting on the state of evolution , in addition to mass and metallicity . to our knowledge",
    "the discrepancies highlighted by aqser  and the other systems mentioned above have not been investigated in detail for more massive stars .",
