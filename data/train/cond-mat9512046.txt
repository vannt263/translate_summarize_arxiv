    "a wide range of quasi - one - dimensional materials have electronic properties that are dominated by the peierls or charge - density - wave instability caused by the electron - phonon interaction @xcite . for a half - filled band",
    "it is energetically favourable for the lattice to dimerize and open an energy gap at the fermi surface .",
    "although the lattice distortion increases the lattice energy , opening the electronic energy gap preferentially lowers the total energy for highly anisotropic systems @xcite .",
    "these systems are often modelled by the one - dimensional holstein @xcite or su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) @xcite models .",
    "most treatments of the peierls instability treat the phonons in the mean - field or rigid lattice approximation .",
    "this is questionable in one - dimension and furthermore , in a wide - range of materials the lattice distortion is comparable to the zero - point motion of the lattice @xcite . it has recently been shown that the quantum lattice fluctuations must be taken into account to satisfactorily describe optical properties @xcite .",
    "several authors have previously considered the role of quantum lattice fluctuations for the ssh model @xcite and the holstein model @xcite at half - filling .",
    "voit and schulz have considered the interplay of quantum lattice fluctuations and electron - electron interactions away from half - filling @xcite .",
    "recently the holstein model , also known as the molecular crystal model , has received considerable attention because the challenge of high-@xmath10 and fullerene superconductors has revealed deficiencies in our understanding of the electron - phonon interaction and the competition between superconductivity and charge - density - wave instabilities .",
    "this has motivated studies of the holstein model in infinite dimensions @xcite , two dimensions @xcite , one dimension @xcite and on just a few sites @xcite .",
    "we consider the holstein model in one dimension at half filling and only with spinless fermions , for simplicity .",
    "the spinless fermions hop along a one - dimensional chain and interact with a phonon mode located on each lattice site . the creation operator for a fermion on site @xmath11",
    "is denoted @xmath12 .",
    "the fermions can hop between neighbouring sites with amplitude @xmath13 . in the absence of interactions",
    "the phonons all have the same frequency @xmath1 , i.e. , they are dispersionless .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling , in units of energy , is @xmath3 .",
    "phonon position and momentum operators are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian for the holstein model ( at half filling ) is @xcite @xmath16 for a system of @xmath17 lattice sites .",
    "this hamiltonian has particle - hole symmetry since the transformation @xmath18 , @xmath19 leaves @xmath20 invariant .",
    "this discrete symmetry is broken in the charge - density - wave phase which has the electronic order parameter @xmath21 and the phonon order parameter @xmath22 which is a measure of the dimerization .",
    "if phonon creation and annihilation operators are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , the hamiltonian ( [ ab1 ] ) can be written @xmath25 thus ground state properties will be determined by two independent parameters , which we will take to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is also useful to define the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling @xmath28    although for simplicity we confine ourselves to the case of spinless fermions this model is still of physical relevance in at least two situations .",
    "the first situation concerns strongly correlated electron systems . in the infinite @xmath29 limit the hubbard model",
    "is known to map onto the case of spinless fermions @xcite .",

    "can be mapped onto a @xmath30 spin chain in zero field with the hamiltonian : @xmath31 it should be pointed out that this is not the standard hamiltonian used to study the spin - peierls transition . however , it does have the same qualitative features : i.e. , a dimerization of the phonons results in a spin singlet ground state with an energy gap",
    ".    it was recently shown @xcite rigorously that for the one - dimensional holstein model of spinless fermions at half - filling there is no long range order for sufficiently small coupling @xmath3 .",
    "hirsch and fradkin @xcite studied the holstein model at half - filling using a world - line monte carlo technique and a strong coupling expansion .",
    "the expansion suggested that for spinless fermions quantum lattice fluctuations destroy the dimerized state if the fermion - phonon coupling was sufficiently weak and the phonon frequency sufficiently high .",
    "the quantum monte carlo simulations were performed for @xmath32 and gave a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the strong coupling expansion .",
    "in contrast , for fermions with spin their results were consistent with dimerization for finite phonon frequency and all non - zero couplings .",
    "zheng , feinberg , and avignon @xcite used a variational polaron wave function to study the holstein model at half - filling . for spinless fermions the ground state is a charge - density wave for _ all _ parameter values .",
    "most of their results were consistent with hirsch and fradkin .",
    "however , they found that for large phonon frequencies ( @xmath33 ) there was a first - order phase transition , with a very large jump in the cdw order parameter , between cdw phases when @xmath34 .",
    "they point out that this transition may be an artefact of the variational treatment since it is known that in small - polaron theory of a single electron a similar two - minimum structure , leading to non - analytic behaviour sometimes referred to as `` self - trapping , '' occurs and is known to be an artefact of the variational teatment @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a study of the holstein model using a green s function monte carlo technique .",
    "section [ seclutfss ] reviews how the metallic phase should be a luttinger liquid and how finite - size scaling can be used to extract the luttinger liquid parameters .",
    "section [ secana ] briefly summarizes known analytic results of the holstein model that can be used to check and help understand our monte carlo results .",
    "section [ secgfqmc ] contains a detailed description of the green s function monte carlo technique that we use .",
    "our results are presented and interpreted in section [ secres ] . the physical picture that emerges from our results",
    "is discussed in the final section .",
    "for weak coupling and high frequency the system is in a metallic , i.e. , gapless phase . according to haldane s `` luttinger liquid '' conjecture @xcite this phase should be in the same universality class as the tomonaga - luttinger model of interacting spinless fermions .",
    "this means the low - energy properties of the metallic phase are completely described by an effective luttinger model with two parameters @xmath4 , the velocity of charge excitations or renormalized fermi velocity , and @xmath5 , the renormalized effective coupling ( stiffness ) constant .",
    "important properties of the luttinger model , quite distinct from those of a conventional fermi liquid , are ( i ) there are no quasi - particle excitations at the fermi surface and ( ii ) all correlation functions have non - universal exponents that can be written in terms of the single parameter @xmath5 . for example , @xmath5 determines the singularity of the momentum distribution function close to the fermi surface @xcite : @xmath35 and of the single - particle density of states @xmath36 where @xmath37 for free fermions @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for attractive ( repulsive ) interactions @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , as explained below , the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be determined from numerical calculations on systems of finite size .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath42 of a conformally invariant system of @xmath17 sites is , to leading order in @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ground state energy per site of the infinite system , @xmath4 is the velocity of charge excitations , and @xmath46 is the conformal charge .",
    "care must be taken with boundary conditions .",
    "we use anti - periodic ( periodic ) boundary conditions for the fermions when there is an even ( odd ) number of fermions .",
    "this corresponds to periodic boundary conditions for the associated spin or bosonic models @xcite .",
    "if the system is a luttinger liquid it belongs to the same universality class as the gaussian model and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the slope of a plot of @xmath48 versus @xmath49 ( compare figure [ fige0 ] ) can then be used to determine @xmath4 .    the energy of the first excited state is , to leading order in @xmath43 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the scaling dimension @xcite .",
    "a luttinger liquid has the unusual property that @xmath51 depends on the coupling constants .    in the presence of particle - hole symmetry @xmath51",
    "can be related to the correlation exponent @xmath5 which determines the asymptotic decay of _ all _ correlation functions .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the ground state energy of @xmath53 fermions on @xmath17 sites . by particle - hole symmetry @xmath54 in a general luttinger liquid of spinless fermions@xcite with charge density @xmath55 the compressibility @xmath56 is given by @xmath57",
    "since particle - hole symmetry implies @xmath58 it follows that @xmath59 which with ( [ lute1 ] ) implies that to leading order in @xmath43 @xmath60 this is identical to ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath61 .",

    "the mean square lattice displacement is @xmath70 the ground state energy per site is @xmath71      this corresponds to the case of a narrow band of small polarons @xcite .",
    "the intersite hopping represents a small perturbation on the situation considered in the previous section .",
    "hirsch and fradkin @xcite derived an effective hamiltonian @xcite involving the new fermion operator @xmath72 that creates a fermion at site @xmath11 and changes the oscillator ground state from one centered at @xmath66 to one centered at @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath73    the first term is the polaron binding energy ( compare equation ( [ eio1 ] ) ) and dominates the ground state energy ( figure [ figgse0.1 ] ) .",
    "the second term describes hopping between neighbouring sites with the bandwidth reduced by the overlap of the oscillator ground state centered at @xmath66 and @xmath65 : @xmath74 the third term describes the second order process ( of order @xmath75 ) where a fermion hops to a neighbouring site and back again .",
    "this term is repulsive because this process is not possible if the neighbouring site is occupied .",
    "@xmath76 there is an additional term , of second order in @xmath75 , involving next nearest neighbour inteactions but it is smaller by a factor of order @xmath77 and so the effective hamiltonian should accurately describe the physics in the strong coupling limit , @xmath78 or @xmath7 . note that the limit @xmath79 corresponds to free fermions , as pointed out by hirsch and fradkin @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ effa1 ] ) is , after a jordan wigner transformation , of the same form as that of the exactly soluble antiferromagnetic xxz quantum spin chain @xcite . for convenience",
    "we now briefly summarize some of the known results for this model .",
    "it can be exactly solved by bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the system is metallic for @xmath80 , i.e. , there is no energy gap or long range order and so it is a luttinger liquid .",
    "it is in an insulating charge - density - wave state for @xmath81 .",

    "however , in the dimerized phase we also have for @xmath208 large @xmath209 and so @xmath210 this equation was used to determine @xmath211 from the results for @xmath212 sites .",
    "figure [ figgap0.1 ] ( a ) shows the coupling constant dependence of @xmath211 for @xmath205 .",
    "the quantum monte carlo data suggests there is a transition near @xmath213 .",
    "this is consistent with the small polaron theory prediction of @xmath206 since the latter theory is only valid to order @xmath214 , i.e. , about 10% .",
    "figure [ figgap0.1 ] ( b ) shows the energy gap as a function of coupling .",
    "it is not possible to detect the transition in the energy gap data .",
    "small polaron theory predicts an energy gap smaller than typical uncertainties in the monte carlo data .",
    "figure [ figq0 ] shows the coupling strength dependence of the mean lattice displacement @xmath187 and the mean square lattice displacement @xmath188 for @xmath196 and a system of 16 sites .",
    "the results are very close to those anticipated for localized fermions ( compare equations ( [ qo1 ] ) and ( [ q21 ] ) ) . for @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "the mean lattice displacement was also non - zero , i.e. , the ground state was polaronic for all couplings , although the magnitude of the displacement decreased significantly with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "similar trends are seen for the holstein model on two sites @xcite .",
    "for @xmath215 the charge velocity is again reduced by polaronic effects ( figure [ figlut1 ] ( a ) ) but not by as much as for @xmath205 .",
    "the interactions in the luttinger liquid are now attractive ( @xmath216 ) . both the order parameter and the energy gap show a transition to the insulating phase near @xmath217 ( figure [ figgap1 ] )",
    ". clearly our results are inconsistent with the universal value @xmath95 expected for a kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite .",
    "for @xmath218 the charge velocity decreases by less than ten per cent with increasing @xmath27 ( figure [ figlut10 ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the cases of @xmath196 and @xmath215 for which the charge velocity decreases by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the correlation function exponent @xmath5 increases by about fifty per cent . as for @xmath215 , @xmath219 at the transition and so the transition can not be a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the order parameter @xmath207 and energy gap @xmath110 become nonzero about @xmath220 ( figure [ figgap10 ] ) .",
    "this is quite different from what is anticipated by hirsch and fradkin @xcite .",
    "they performed simulations from @xmath221 up to @xmath222 .",
    "they found a smooth decrease in the critical value of @xmath223 with increasing @xmath224 , and anticipated a smooth crossover to @xmath225 for @xmath226 .",
    "extrapolating their results to @xmath184 gives @xmath227 and @xmath228 compared to our value of @xmath229 .",
    "note that the ratio of the energy gap to its mean field value ( figure [ figgap10 ] ( b ) ) is much smaller than the ratio of the charge - density - wave order parameter to its mean field value .",
    "this is consistent with work showing that the zero point motion of the lattice can reduce the magnitude of the order parameter by a small amount but produce a substantial subgap tail in the fermionic density of states @xcite .",
    "( for example , results on the continuum version of the ssh model shown in figures 1 and 3 of reference @xcite show that for one set of parameter values the energy gap can be about 60 % of the mean - field value while the order parameter is only reduced by about 5 % ) .    the phase boundary as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 between the metallic and insulating phases",
    "is shown in figure [ figphased ] .",
    "the solid curve is the boundary predicted by small polaron theory and the xxz model ( section [ secpol ] ) .",
    "this curve is only shown for @xmath230 since this model is only valid in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "the crosses are the boundary points deduced from figures [ figgap0.1 ] , [ figgap1 ] , and [ figgap10 ] .",
    "it should be stressed that there is some ambiguity in determining the phase boundary . according to mean - field theory the transition occurs at @xmath6 but",
    "the solid curves in figures [ figgap1 ] and [ figgap10 ] suggest that the transition is actually only detectable at @xmath232 and @xmath233 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath205 small polaron theory and the xxz model predict a kosterlitz - thouless transition at @xmath234 and the solid curve in figure [ figgap0.1 ] ( a ) shows there is very little ambiguity associated with this transition point . for comparison",
    "the boundary points found by hirsch and fradkin @xcite ( figure 11 in their paper ) are also shown .",
    "for @xmath8 there is a discrepancy between our results and theirs : they observe the transition at smaller coupling than we do .",
    "we have no explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "we have shown that the green s function monte carlo technique can be successfully used to investigate a one dimensional fermion - phonon model . as far as we are aware this is the first application of this technique to this important class of models .",
    "the results were of sufficiently high precision that a finite size scaling analysis of the results could be performed .",
    "for the case of free fermions ( @xmath6 ) and the strong coupling limit ( @xmath235 ) our results agree with known analytic results .",
    "our results are consistent with the following physical picture of the holstein model of spinless fermions at half - filling . for sufficiently weak coupling",
    "the system is in a metallic , i.e. , gapless phase , with the properties of a luttinger liquid , i.e. , the exponents associated with the decay of correlation functions depend on the coupling strength .",
    "the fermions are polaronic , i.e. , there is a finite phonon displacement @xmath236 associated with the occupation of a site by a fermion and the velocity of excitations , @xmath4 , is reduced below the free electron value @xmath237 . as the coupling @xmath3 increases and @xmath26 decreases @xmath236 increases and @xmath4 ( which is a measure of the polaronic band width ) decreases .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviour is seen for the two - site holstein model @xcite . in the anti - adiabatic limit ( @xmath238 )",
    "the effective interaction between polarons is repulsive and for strong coupling the holstein model can be mapped onto the xxz antiferromagnetic spin chain ( section [ secpol ] ) . however , as @xmath224 increases the effective interaction becomes attractive .",
    "this is indicated by a change in the value of the stiffness constant @xmath5 from values less than one to values larger than one .",
    "when the fermion - phonon coupling is sufficiently large the system undergoes a transition to an insulating phase , i.e. , an energy gap opens at the fermi surface .",
    "there is long - range charge - density - wave order and a dimerization of the phonons in this phase .",
    "our results for @xmath8 and @xmath9 are inconsistent with the metal - insulator transition being infinite order . on the other hand we do not see any evidence of the first - order transition suggested by zheng , feinberg , and avignon@xcite and by wu , huang , and sun@xcite for certain parameter values .",
    "this work suggests several possible future investigations which we plan to pursue : ( a ) the adiabatic region of the phase diagram ( @xmath239 ) , in which we found a larger region of the metallic phase than anticipated by hirsch and fradkin , needs to be investigated further .",
    "( b ) the relative importance of superconducting and charge - density - wave correlations should be investigated in the region of the metallic phase for which the effective interactions are attractive .",
    "( c ) alternative variational wavefunctions , such as the double gaussian proposed by shore and sander@xcite , could be used instead of the single gaussian ( [ gf18 ] ) used for the variational guidance .",
    "finally , we plan to use this method to investigate the holstein model with spin , and away from half - filling , as well as the su - schrieffer - heeger model , and the spin - peierls problem .",
