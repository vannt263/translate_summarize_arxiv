    "we then use these constructions to construct the standard topology on the total space of the bundle of regular cubic differentials over @xmath7 .",
    "roughly , we define a metric @xmath52 on each noded riemann surface @xmath3 which is equal to the hyperbolic metric on the thick part of @xmath3 and a flat cylindrical metric on the collar and cusp neighborhoods making up the thin part of @xmath19",
    ". then convergence of a sequence @xmath28 is defined as convergence of @xmath53 in @xmath7 , together with @xmath54 convergence of the cubic differentials @xmath55 .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the basics of hyperbolic affine spheres @xcite .",
    "let @xmath56 be a hyperbolic affine sphere , which is a surface in @xmath14 asymptotic to a cone over a bounded convex domain @xmath9 .",

    "two basic invariant tensors , the blaschke metric and the cubic tensor , thus descend to @xmath9 . the blaschke metric induces an invariant conformal structure on @xmath9 , and thus on the quotient @xmath8 .",
    "the cubic tensor induces a holomorphic cubic differential @xmath4 .    starting from a pair @xmath2",
    ", we can recover the picture of @xmath48 by introducing a background metric @xmath15 and solving wang s integrability condition ( [ u - eq ] ) for a conformal factor @xmath57 . then @xmath58 is the blaschke metric , and if it is complete , we recover the global hyperbolic affine sphere @xmath56 and @xmath48 .",
    "the hyperbolic affine sphere over @xmath9 can be defined as the radial graph of @xmath59 for @xmath60 a convex solution to the monge - ampre equation @xmath61 with zero dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath62 .",

    "we also prove a new result , proposition [ separate - o ] , concerning sequences of pairs of points @xmath63 , and show that if the blaschke distance between @xmath64 and @xmath65 diverges to infinity , then any benzcri limits of the pointed space @xmath66 and @xmath67 for sequences @xmath68 , must be disjoint ( in a sense made precise below ) .",
    "we also discuss the two - dimensional case , due to wang @xcite , and recall how to solve an initial - value problem to produce a hyperbolic affine sphere @xmath56 from the data @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a complete blaschke metric .",
    "finally , we begin the proof of theorem [ main - thm ] in section [ cubic - to - rp2-sec ] . in this section",

    "we produced a locally bounded family of sub- and super - solutions to ( [ u - eq ] ) uniform over the regular parts of @xmath73 .",
    "this allows us to solve the equation ( [ u - eq ] ) and to take the limit of blaschke metrics as @xmath74 .",
    "a uniqueness theorem of dumas - wolf @xcite shows that this limit is the blaschke metric on @xmath75 .",
    "we then use techniques of ordinary differential equations to show the holonomy and developing maps converge .    in the final section [ rp2-to - cubic - sec ] ,",
    "we prove the remaining part of the main theorem , by showing that we can pass from convergent sequences of regular convex @xmath1 structures to convergent sequences of regular cubic differentials over noded riemann surfaces .",
    "the proof depends on the thick - thin decomposition of hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "in particular , we use proposition [ separate - o ] and lower bounds on the blaschke metric in terms of the hyperbolic metric , to rule out benzcri sequences in which the point approaches the thin part in moduli .",
    "conversely , if we have points converging in the same component of the thick part of moduli , we use the uniform bounds on the diameter and the ode theory from section [ cubic - to - rp2-sec ] to show the limit of the domains must be the same up to an @xmath13 action .",
