    "<S> the large moose / quiver diagram provides a useful graphical representation of the string and its excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this representation has a natural explanation in a t - dual language . </S>",
    "<S> the dual theory is a non - relativistic type iia string wound around the t - dual direction , and bound by a quadratic newtonian potential . </S>",
    "<S> we end with some comments on d - string / d - particle states , a possible lift to m - theory and the relation to deconstruction .    </S>",

    "<S> attempts to physically realize this idea led to the large - n expansion of gauge theory @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , string theories have indeed been seen to emerge from gauge theories , most notably in matrix theory @xcite and in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> matrix theory gives , in principle , a precise definition for non - perturbative m - theory using large - n supersymmetric quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> toroidal compactifications of m - theory are then described by large - n gauge theories in various dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of strings in terms of gauge fields can be made rather explicit in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> the best example is matrix string theory @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> perturbative string states and also d - branes in type iia string theory can be identified in terms of operators of a two - dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetric gauge theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the ads / cft correspondence provided a very explicit map between gauge theory operators and string theory states in the supergravity limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the proposal can be implicitly extended to the full string theory , it proves difficult to construct strings explicitly out of gauge fields in this framework . </S>",
    "<S> recently , new insight was obtained by considering a special limit of the @xmath5 background of type iib string theory , in which it is possible to construct string states from gauge theory operators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by taking a penrose limit @xcite of the background , which provides a maximally supersymmetric solution of type iib string theory @xcite , and relating this to a special subset of operators in @xmath6 supersymmetric gauge theory .    </S>",
    "<S> penrose limits of spacetimes generally lead to pp - wave backgrounds , which are exact backgrounds for string propagation @xcite and are exactly solvable in the light - cone gauge @xcite . in light - cone quantization , it is often useful to compactify a null direction . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) , which provides a convenient regulator for string theory @xcite . in this picture , one has interacting strings carrying quantized units of the light - cone momentum , with the minimal momentum being carried by a `` string bit '' . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of dlcq is most natural in the context of matrix theory @xcite , where it has been argued that each sector of the dlcq of m - theory is exactly described by a @xmath7 matrix model . </S>",
    "<S> although a compact null direction may look somewhat strange , it is best thought of as the limit @xcite of a spacelike compactification .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to study type iib string theory in a dlcq pp - wave background . </S>",
    "<S> the penrose limits that have been considered so far in the ads / cft context always lead to a pp - wave with a non - compact null direction . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that there is a novel scaling limit of a particular @xmath5 background , which precisely gives rise to a dlcq pp - wave . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the null direction is a finite controllable parameter of this background . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding gauge theory is an @xmath0 superconformal `` moose '' or `` quiver '' theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of fascinating aspects of the gauge theory / pp - wave correspondence will unfold as we explore this model . as in previous examples following the original ideas of ref.@xcite , we find gauge theory operators which can be identified to the string ground state , zero - mode oscillators and excited oscillator states . however , there are remarkable differences , and a much richer structure appears due to the dlcq nature of the string background . </S>",
    "<S> we find a gauge theory operator that describes a string ground state for every value of the ( positive ) quantized light - cone momentum @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . we will also construct operators that describe winding states of the string over the null direction . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge theory operators automatically possess all the properties required of dlcq string states .    </S>",
    "<S> our construction turns out to have a tantalizing property : the operators that describe dlcq momentum states have the structure of a `` string '' of operators that winds around the moose / quiver diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this is suggestive of a string winding state . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the gauge theory operators that describe winding of the dlcq string look very much like momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that we should consider t - dualization of the dlcq pp - wave to find the most direct correspondence with the gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the requisite t - duality and find a theory of non - relativistic strings @xcite bound in a harmonic - oscillator potential . </S>",
    "<S> the strings are wound around a compact spatial direction which can be identified with the `` theory space '' direction of the quiver . </S>",
    "<S> on lifting to m - theory we find non - relativistic membranes winding around a 2-torus and bound in a potential . </S>",
    "<S> both these observations suggest that the moose / quiver theory , in our scaling limit , provides a precise realization of the concept of `` deconstruction '' put forward in refs.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the moose / quiver gauge theory and its @xmath5 dual in some detail , and exhibit the scaling limit that we consider . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the dlcq pp - wave background and show how it arises in our scaling limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss general properties of string propagation in this background . </S>",
    "<S> section 4 is devoted to the identification of spacetime quantum numbers with charges of gauge - theory operators . in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly construct gauge theory operators to describe various string excitations in the dlcq pp - wave . </S>",
    "<S> section 6 deals with t - duality of the null direction to obtain a non - relativistic string , while section 7 gives a physical interpretation of the relationship between quivers and strings . in section 8 </S>",
    "<S> we make some conjectural remarks about how d - strings and other non - perturbative objects may be described in our formalism , and exhibit the lift of the iia non - relativistic string to m - theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we relate our work to the deconstruction idea , and close with some comments .    * . the large moose / quiver theory and its holographic dual </S>",
    "<S> *    it has been known for some time that one can get four - dimensional conformal field theories by placing d3-branes at orbifolds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these theories admit an @xmath5 dual where the compact 5-manifold is an orbifold of @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the specific case we will consider here is obtained by starting with @xmath1 d3-branes transverse to the 6-dimensional space @xmath10 . in the covering space </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath11 d3-branes , which define a `` parent '' @xmath6 super - yang - mills theory , of which the orbifold theory is a projection .    </S>",
    "<S> the orbifold group @xmath12 acts on @xmath13 by : ( z_1,z_2,z_3)(z_1,z_2 , ^-1z_3 ) , = e^2in_2  . </S>",
    "<S> [ aledef ] the theory on the brane world - volume is a @xmath0 superconformal field theory in four dimensions , with the r - symmetry group @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge group is su(n_1)^(1)su(n_1)^(2 ) su(n_1)^(n_2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fields in the vector multiplet for each factor of the gauge group are denoted @xmath15 with @xmath16 labelling the gauge group , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , there are hypermultiplets @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 are bi - fundamentals in the @xmath21 of @xmath22 and the @xmath23 are bi - fundamentals in the complex conjugate representation @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the matter content of the gauge theory can be succintly summarised in the form of a quiver / moose diagram , see fig.1 . here </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath25 language to describe the @xmath26 gauge theory , which will be of use later . </S>",
    "<S> the fields @xmath27 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 can be identified with the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions of the @xmath13 .     </S>",
    "<S> +    the holographic dual of the quiver theory in question is type iib string theory on @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath12 is obtained by thinking of the 5-sphere as embedded in @xmath31 where the action is as prescribed in ( [ aledef ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a fixed circle along an equator of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 space has a radius given by r^2 =  , [ adsradius ] where @xmath33 is the type iib string coupling . </S>",
    "<S> there are also @xmath11 units of 5-form flux through the @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the orbifold action , the volume of @xmath34 is reduced by a factor @xmath3 compared to that of the covering space @xmath9 , with the latter having the same radius as that of @xmath32 given in eq.([adsradius ] ) . similarly , there are @xmath1 units of 5-form flux through the @xmath34 factor , which descend from @xmath11 units of flux in the covering space .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the coupling constant in each of the gauge group factors is given in terms of the type iib coupling constant as ( g_ym)_i^2 = 4 g_s^b n_2  . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the t hooft coupling relevant for each factor is = ( g_ym)_i^2 n_1 = 4g^b_s n_1 n_2  . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same as the t hooft coupling on the original @xmath11 d3-branes before orbifolding , for which the yang - mills coupling was equal to @xmath35 .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider a scaling limit when both @xmath1 and @xmath3 become large , with the ratio @xmath36 held fixed . in this limit the t hooft coupling @xmath37 diverges . as argued in ref.@xcite in the context of @xmath38 super - yang - mills theory with @xmath6 supersymmetry , the relevant quantity that needs to be kept finite , is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a @xmath41 charge and the relevant states have very large @xmath40 . in our case , we will see that the role of @xmath40 is played by @xmath3 , while @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> so the quantity that should be kept finite for us is @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved precisely by scaling @xmath1 and @xmath3 to infinity and keeping @xmath33 small but finite .    * . the dlcq pp - wave *    in this section </S>",
    "<S> we start from the holographic description of the quiver gauge theory under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> we will take a limit of the dual spacetime , which is known as the penrose limit @xcite ( _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite , for generalization to supergravity ) . </S>",
    "<S> the essential idea is to consider a null geodesic and look at the spacetime in the neighbourhood of the geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> it was first demonstrated by penrose that this is a sensible limit to consider in any geometry and the result is always what is known as a plane - parallel wave or pp - wave for short .    _ . </S>",
    "<S> the penrose limit of @xmath44 _    as mentioned above , to obtain the penrose limit of any gravitational background , one has to focus on a light - like geodesic . in the particular case of @xmath45 , we choose a null geodesic which is based at the origin of @xmath32 and carries some angular momentum along the compact directions . because of the singular nature of the compact manifold , the result depends on whether one takes this trajectory to lie along the singular locus or not . </S>",
    "<S> the former choice results in a pp - wave background that has the @xmath12 ale singularity as part of its transverse space @xcite-@xcite . the latter choice , which was briefly discussed in ref.@xcite , results instead in the maximally supersymmetric pp - wave background . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the latter case as it is relevant for the scaling limit in which we are interested .    </S>",
    "<S> let us write the metric of @xmath44 as : ds^2 & = & r^2  , [ adsmet ] where the first line is the @xmath32 metric in global coordinates , while the remaining terms describe the metric for an @xmath9 embedded in a 6-dimensional space containing a @xmath12 ale singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship with the complex @xmath46 coordinates and the angles is : z_1=r e^i , z_2=r e^i , z_3=r e^i . in this parametrization </S>",
    "<S> the orbifold is obtained by demanding that the angles @xmath47 and @xmath48 are periodic modulo @xmath49 but in addition have a combined periodicity under + 2n_2,-2n_2  . </S>",
    "<S> [ periodic ] note that with this choice there are no explicit factors of @xmath50 occurring in the metric .    to take the pp - wave limit </S>",
    "<S> , we now define new coordinates @xmath51 by & r = r ,  w= r , & y = r  . [ pplimit ] and introduce the light - cone coordinates & x^+ = 12(t+ ) , & x^- = r^22(t- ) [ lcone ]  . making the substitutions the metric ( [ adsmet ] ) becomes ds^2 & = & r^2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ newadsmet ] in the limit @xmath52 the metric reduces to @xcite ds^2=-4dx^+ dx^- - ( r^2+w^2+y^2 ) dx^+^2 + dr^2+r^2d_3 ^ 2 + dw^2+w^2d^2 + dy^2+y^2d^2 this is just the universal pp - wave background which has been found in many other cases . </S>",
    "<S> it can be written in the standard form ds^2 = -4dx^+ dx^- - _ i=1 ^ 8 ( x^i)^2 dx^+^2 + _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1 ^ 8 dx^i^2  , [ ppwaveg ] where we introduced the eight transversal coordinates @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a ramond - ramond flux in the geometry ( [ ppwaveg ] ) : f_+1234 = f_+5678 = const  . </S>",
    "<S> [ rrflx ]    although our model gives rise to the standard pp - wave metric in the penrose limit , there is actually an important difference : the lightlike direction @xmath54 is _ </S>",
    "<S> compact_. from eq.([periodic ] ) , the @xmath55 periodicity of the angle @xmath47 translates into the following periodicity condition on the light - cone coordinates & & x^+x^+ + n_2 + & & x^- x^- + r^2n_2  . </S>",
    "<S> this combined shift in @xmath56 and @xmath54 has to be accompanied by a simultaneous shift in @xmath57 . under a scaling @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath59 . </S>",

    "<S> winding states and non - zero mode oscillators _    an important difference between our large moose / quiver theory and the @xmath6 yang mills theory is that the @xmath83-fields carry labels , and have to appear in a particular order inside the trace . </S>",

    "<S> cyclicity is implemented by the shift @xmath153 , which causes the expression to pick up a phase @xmath154 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase must be equal to 1 and hence the total mode number is set to zero modulo @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this all seems nice and well , but we appear to have lost our winding states ! </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising because we have written our states in a notation that is inherited from the parent @xmath6 theory . </S>",

    "<S> [ nshift ] we now apply the first relation to replace all the @xmath166 matrices inside the trace . by conjugating the @xmath165 matrices through the @xmath163 and @xmath168 matrices </S>",
    "<S> one picks up a phase @xmath175 . in effect </S>",
    "<S> we have not changed anything : we simply shifted all @xmath20 fields by @xmath3 steps , which gives back the same operator . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , the operator vanishes unless the phase is equal to one . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one concludes that the sum of all mode numbers is indeed a multiple of @xmath8 .    in most of the above discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we have focussed on the oscillators constructed out of @xmath168 . however , it is straightforward to see that similar expressions hold for the remaining oscillators , with @xmath168 replaced by @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , or one of the fermionic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this completes our construction of perturbative string states for the pp - wave background with a compact light - cone direction . </S>",
    "<S> the entire spectrum of the string in the dlcq pp - wave is thus reproduced by this set of operators of the @xmath180 gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> they represent a sector of the gauge theory with maximal supersymmetry .    the picture of gauge theory operators winding around a circular moose diagram , which has a circumference of order @xmath3 and is therefore very large , is rather suggestive . </S>",
    "<S> even though these operators describe momentum modes in type iib string theory , they appear to build up a string winding over a spatial dimension , similarly , the gauge theory operators describing winding modes in type iib string theory have the appearance of momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that t - duality is involved . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we will carry out the relevant t - duality explicitly and exhibit the relation between the large moose diagram and the t - dual string .    </S>",
    "<S> this is also somewhat related to the idea of `` deconstruction '' @xcite in which a spatial dimension is created by taking a suitable limit of a moose / quiver theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will explain in section 9 . , our limit differs from the one in ref.@xcite .    * . </S>",
    "<S> t - duality of the dlcq pp - wave background *    the periodicity of the @xmath54 direction is a remnant of the combined @xmath181 periodicity in the angles @xmath47 and @xmath48 , exhibited in eq.([periodic ] ) . before taking the limit @xmath182 the periodic direction was space - like . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one can perform a buscher - type t - duality along this periodic direction .    to perform the @xmath183-duality </S>",
    "<S> , we go back to the original metric in eq.([adsmet ] ) and write down only the terms in the @xmath184 and @xmath47 directions explicitly : ds^2 = r^2 + ds_transverse^2  . </S>",
    "<S> next we make the substitutions defined in eq.([pplimit ] ) , and express @xmath47 in terms of @xmath184 and @xmath54 as in eq.([lcone ] ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the metric becomes : ds^2 & = & r^2 ( ^2wr^2yr-^2 rr ) dt^2 - 4 ^2wr^2yr dt dx^- + & & + 4r^2 ^2wr^2yr ( dx^-)^2 + h_ij(x^ir ) dx^i dx^j  , where we parametrize the transverse metric by @xmath185 . </S>",
    "<S> we know that @xmath186 as @xmath187 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that , before taking the pp - wave limit , @xmath54 is spacelike : there is a small @xmath188 in the metric of order @xmath189 . </S>",
    "<S> the metric of the transverse space , which we have not written down explicitly here , is the usual flat metric with no factors of @xmath190 in front . for the transverse space we can consistently ignore corrections in @xmath189 , since those directions will be unaffected by t - duality .    </S>",
    "<S> we now perform a t - duality along the spacelike direction @xmath54 , following the usual duality rules . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is a different t - duality than the one considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after this , we denote the t - dual coordinate by @xmath191 , to end up with the metric : ds^2 = -r^2 ^2 rr dt^2 + r^2 ^ 2wr^2yr ( dx^9)^2 + h_ij dx^i dx^j  , [ tdualmetric ] along with a b - field and dilaton : b_t9 = -r^2,g^a_s = rr_- g^b_s  . </S>",
    "<S> [ tdualb ] note that @xmath192 now has period @xmath193 , with @xmath194 as given in eq.([rminus ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us take the limit @xmath187 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that some components of the metric , and the @xmath84-field and string coupling , become infinite in this limit . however , it turns out that string propagation on this background is finite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the @xmath84-field is a critical electric field , and cancels the leading divergent piece in the string world - sheet action @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the induced metric in static gauge . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath197 denotes the spacetime metric in the @xmath198 plane . momentarily ignoring the derivative terms </S>",
    "<S> , we find : + b & = & r^2 - r^2 + & = & 12 ( r^2 + w^2 + y^2 ) + o(1r^2 ) + & = & 12 _ i=1 ^ 8 ( x^i)^2 + o(1r^2 )  . </S>",
    "<S> if we put back the derivative terms , the above calculation will instead give : + b = 12 _ i=1 ^ 8 + o(1r^2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the non - relativistic string propagating in a background with a newtonian potential of harmonic - oscillator type . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the leading dependence on @xmath80 in eqs.([tdualmetric ] , [ tdualb ] ) above is identical to that which appears in the non - commutative open string ( ncos ) @xcite and non - relativistic closed string ( nrcs ) theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our model is therefore an nrcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the pp - wave metric that we started with , it inherits a harmonic oscillator potential in which the light closed strings are bound .    to see that the effective coupling constant of this non - relativistic theory is finite , we recall that the coupling for the nr closed strings winding in the direction of the critical electric field is the same as for the nc open strings . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is well - known to be @xcite : g_o^2 = g_s . inserting the appropriate values from eqs.([tdualmetric ] , [ tdualb ] ) above and taking @xmath187 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that for our model , g_o^2 = g^b_s r_- . </S>",
    "<S> so the effective coupling for the type iia nr closed string is independent of @xmath80 in the limit , but it varies in the transverse directions . because of the potential , low - lying states of the string are localized in the region around @xmath199 , and on dimensional grounds one expects that the square root in the above equation is replaced by @xmath200 for such states .    </S>",
    "<S> there is also a 5-form ramond - ramond background on the type iib side that must be t - dualized . to start with , we had : f^(5 ) = r^4 dt(dv)_4 + r^4 d(dv)_4 where @xmath201 are the 4-forms on the @xmath202 and @xmath203 spaces respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we use eq.([pplimit ] ) and the definition of @xmath54 in eq.([lcone ] ) , and take the limit @xmath187 . </S>",
    "<S> then the above expression becomes : f^(5 ) = dt(dr)_4 + dt(dw)_2(dy)_2 - 2r^2 dx^- ( dw)_2(dy)_2  . </S>",
    "<S> next , performing a t - duality , we find a 4-form and a 6-form field strength on the type iia side : f^(6 ) & = & 2 dt(dr)_4 dx^9 , + f^(4 ) & = & -2r^2 ( dw)_2(dy)_2 [ rrforms ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have an electric 6-form and a magnetic 4-form field strength . </S>",
    "<S> as one can check , the two are dual to each other </S>",
    "<S> . these rr fields will give masses to the worldsheet fermions of the string , which are necessary for maximal supersymmetry , just as the 5-forms do on the type iib side .    in section 8 </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the lift of this background to m - theory , on which it gives rise to an analogous non - relativistic membrane wrapped on a 2-torus .    * . </S>",
    "<S> large quiver as non - relativistic string *    we have argued that the quiver gauge theory with gauge group @xmath204 with large @xmath205 is dual to type iib string theory on the pp - wave background with a compact lightlike direction @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that one can perform a t - duality over the lightlike direction , thereby going to a type iia description in terms of a non - relativistic closed string theory ( nrcs ) . in the following , we present a number of observations which address the physical meaning of this correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that the large moose / quiver theory deconstructs the non - relativistic string , and eventually m - theory , in a rather precise way .    </S>",
    "<S> we have described how ground states and oscillators of type iib string theory on a dlcq pp - wave background can be constructed from gauge theory operators . </S>",
    "<S> a key ingredient was the construction of a string ground state for every ( positive integer ) dlcq momentum @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this state was associated to the trace of a `` string '' of bi - fundamental @xmath83 fields wrapping @xmath8 times around the `` theory space '' defined by the quiver diagram . </S>",
    "<S> although in the type iib language it is a momentum state , in the quiver theory it is reminiscent of a winding state of some other string theory . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the states describing the winding of iib strings around the dlcq direction , obtained using the @xmath163-matrices , look very much like momentum states of a string theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we now see that this other string theory is precisely the type iia nrcs theory ! </S>",
    "<S> it is known that in nrcs theory , along the direction of the critical electric field there are light states which are closed - string winding modes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the winding can take place only in one orientation around the circle . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason is simple @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider the non - commutative open string ( ncos ) theories obtained by turning on critical electric @xmath84-fields over a d - brane . in these theories , </S>",
    "<S> we know that open strings are very light when they align one way along the electric field , and very heavy when they are lined up the other way </S>",
    "<S> . now if the direction along the electric field is compact , an open string can align along it and stretch most of the way around . </S>",
    "<S> when its end points come close to each other , and because the open - string coupling is finite , this string can close up and become a closed string wound on the compact direction . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> ncos theories on compact directions include light winding strings . if now we remove the open - string sector by taking away the original d - brane , we will be left with the closed strings wound in one direction as the light states . </S>",
    "<S> this is the nrcs theory .    </S>",
    "<S> evidently these nrcs winding modes are just the t - dual states of the dlcq momentum modes . just as dlcq momenta are always positive and never negative ( the latter become infinitely heavy ) , the nrcs winding modes are light for one orientation and very heavy for the other . thus winding states of the non - relativistic closed string </S>",
    "<S> are identified with the gauge theory operators wrapping our large moose / quiver .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the quiver deconstructs this string in a very precise way . </S>",
    "<S> the `` string '' of @xmath83-fields winding around the quiver in one way is the light nr closed string . </S>",
    "<S> a string of @xmath206-fields , which wrap the quiver in the other sense , would be identified with the very heavy closed string that is wrongly aligned with the electric field , so it is not in the spectrum of light states . </S>",
    "<S> single wrapping of @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath122 , is identified with a `` string bit '' in dlcq language , while the @xmath20 s themselves are the latticized components of this string bit . </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing @xmath79 value of the @xmath83 fields leads to the vanishing energy of the string bit which is aligned with the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> and the @xmath163 operators in the quiver theory , which created winding states of the dlcq string , are the momenta of the nr closed string . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we can insert @xmath163 raised to any positive or negative integer power , just like the allowed momenta of an nrcs . the quiver theory in the limit we consider is a non - relativistic string with a quadratic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the observations of @xcite made in the context of flat space nrcs theory and its relation to dlcq strings are not modified in the pp - wave background .    * . </S>",
    "<S> beyond perturbation theory *    so far we have analyzed the large moose theory at the perturbative level . in this section </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss some ideas on how to describe non - perturbative aspects of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we propose an identification of d - string states in terms of operators in the gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the lift of the type iia solution to m - theory .    _ . </S>",
    "<S> d - string states _    in addition to the fundamental string oscillator and winding states that we have discussed , we also expect to find states in the string theory that represent d - strings winding around the dlcq direction . these would be s - dual , in the framework of type iib string theory , to the f - string winding states . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , using various elements of the @xmath207 s - duality group , one can construct @xmath208 winding strings where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are relatively prime .    the moose / quiver gauge theory that we started with </S>",
    "<S> is also believed to have a large s - duality group which contains @xmath207 as a subgroup @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative operators that we have considered so far are constructed out of electric variables that are weakly coupled when the yang - mills coupling is small . </S>",
    "<S> but in principle for each operator that we have constructed there must exist corresponding operators that are expressed in magnetic or even in dyonic variables . </S>",
    "<S> these different operators are then related by @xmath207 tranformations . </S>",
    "<S> the ground states that we considered can easily be seen to be invariant under the electromagnetic @xmath207 transformations . </S>",
    "<S> they represent supersymmetric graviton states that carry only space - time momentum . </S>",
    "<S> also the states that are obtained by acting with zero mode oscillators will be invariant : they correspond to gravitons whose transversal movements are described by excited harmonic oscillator states .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero mode oscillator states and the states with non - zero winding are true @xmath211-string states , and will transform non - trivially under @xmath207 and are mapped on excited @xmath208 string states with non - zero winding . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to think about these states from a @xmath183-dual perspective . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath183-duality the discrete light - cone momentum @xmath8 becomes string winding , while string winding @xmath74 is mapped on to the discrete momentum along the string . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath212-string winding becomes identified with @xmath212-particle number . in this dual language </S>",
    "<S> the extra states that we are looking for are thus described by strings bound to @xmath212-particles .    </S>",
    "<S> can we introduce @xmath212-particles on the quiver / moose diagram ? </S>",
    "<S> this is a hard question , because it involves non - perturbative issues in the gauge theory , and might require the introduction of the dual magnetic gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> however , there appears to be a natural proposal for these @xmath212-string / particle states which only involves pure electric variables . to give some motivation for the proposal , we note that the perturbative string states represent `` electric '' states associated to the confining phase of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the `` magnetic '' states must be obtained from a dual higgs phase . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the @xmath83-fields get a vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 invariance implies that they all get the same vev . </S>",
    "<S> since the theory is conformal invariant , we can put these vev s equal to one . </S>",
    "<S> hence we have @xmath213 . in the higgs phase , </S>",
    "<S> it is very natural to construct operators using the shift matrix @xmath165 in the same way as we did for the @xmath163-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , in the @xmath122 dlcq sector we can define oscillators a^__,m , n**_m , n * * u^m v^n  , insert them into the trace , and sum over all locations . </S>",
    "<S> the f- and d- string winding numbers may then be defined as the sum of the @xmath71 and @xmath74 mode numbers respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the states with @xmath214 will be pure d - strings , while those with @xmath215 with @xmath208 both nonzero and relatively prime will correspond to @xmath216 @xmath208 strings . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this reproduces the operators we had before , and extends them in an almost manifest @xmath207 invariant manner . </S>",
    "<S> there is one subtlety however . </S>",
    "<S> the number of @xmath166 fields that are inside the trace must be reduced by the number of @xmath212-string windings , because otherwise the trace would vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath217 matrices play the role of ` place holders ' and create ` holes ' in the string of @xmath83-fields . </S>",
    "<S> this is just because the fields are replaced by their vacuum expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> these holes are the locations of the @xmath212-particles on the string .    </S>",
    "<S> this can be generalized to general @xmath8 values by extending @xmath218 to be @xmath219 matrices , and requiring that the resulting states be invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath212-string / particle number is then defined in terms of the phase that is picked up when we replace all @xmath166 fields by @xmath220 and similarly for the @xmath168 s . </S>",
    "<S> this phase will be an @xmath3th root of unity , and from @xmath221 we get ^^m , where @xmath222 and @xmath223 is the d - string winding number .    </S>",
    "<S> we should perhaps emphasize that the proposed description of the @xmath212-string / particle states came from a heuristic argument and was not derived in a precise way . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are pretty sure that there must be states that carry these quantum number , basically because of the @xmath224 symmetry of the underlying gauge theory . at finite coupling </S>",
    "<S> the gauge theory contains perturbative as well as non - perturbative states , and therefore it should also give a non - perturbative of the iib string in the dlcq background description , or the type iia string in the dual background . if this is indeed true than we should conclude that the large quiver / moose theory also has a dual m - theory description in which the @xmath211- and @xmath212-string states combine to form the states of a membrane that wraps the @xmath192 as well as the @xmath225 m - theory circle . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we will describe the @xmath226-theory background that is dual to the dlcq pp - wave and in which the membrane is living .    _ . lift to m - theory _    the type iia background t - dual to the dlcq pp - wave , described in eqs.([tdualmetric ] , [ tdualb ] ) can be lifted to m - theory in the standard way at finite @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> . it will be convenient to rewrite these formulae as follows . </S>",
    "<S> define : h(w , y ) = 1g_s^br_- r  . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we rescale @xmath192 so that it has periodicity @xmath227 . </S>",
    "<S> the type iia background is now given by : ds^2 & = & - r^2 ^2rr dt^2 + 1(g^b_s)^2 h^2 ( dx^9)^2 + h_ijdx^i dx^j , + b_t9 & = & - r^2r_-,e^= 1h  . </S>",
    "<S> this solution lifts to the following m - theory background : ds_11 ^ 2 & = & h^23 , + c_t910 & = & - r^2r_- . </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath192 and @xmath225 are periodic modulo @xmath49 , and @xmath190 in this equation is just @xmath228 with no dimensional factors . from the metric , we see that the ratio of the physical radii of @xmath225 and @xmath192 is @xmath33 , as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> again we see that the background itself is singular as @xmath187 , but membrane propagation is finite and non - relativistic . </S>",
    "<S> non - relativistic membranes are related to om ( open membrane ) theory @xcite in a similar way as non - relativistic strings are related to ncos theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can compute the membrane action in static gauge , again ignoring derivative terms to start with : + c & = & 1g^b_s h r - r^2r_- + & = & 12r_-_i=1 ^ 8 ( x^i)^2 + o(1r^2 )  . as for the string </S>",
    "<S> , the kinetic terms can be restored leading to a free action for the transverse scalars on the membrane world - volume . </S>",
    "<S> the background will also have a 7-form field strength and its dual 4-form , following from eqs.([rrforms ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these will give masses to the fermions of the membrane world - volume theory as required by maximal supersymmetry .    * . </S>",
    "<S> relation to deconstruction *    we have been working with the @xmath204 @xmath229 supersymmetric quiver gauge theory for large @xmath205 . the same theory , for finite @xmath1 and large @xmath3 , was the starting point for deconstructing @xmath230 superconformal field theory in six dimensions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the essential idea in deconstruction @xcite is to start with a four - dimensional gauge theory for which the `` theory space '' is large . to be precise </S>",
    "<S> , one takes a large number of gauge groups and introduce matter in non - trivial representations of two of the gauge groups simultaneously ; a prototypical example of this being the quiver gauge theory under consideration . upon going to the higgs branch of the theory by giving vevs to the matter in the bifundamentals , one can at some intermediate energy scales </S>",
    "<S> recover approximate five - dimensional gauge dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the fifth dimension is played by the direction in the theory space . in the deep infra - red </S>",
    "<S> the theory recovers four - dimensional behaviour , since the higgs vev causes the large gauge group to be broken down to the diagonal subgroup . the five - dimensional gauge coupling and the lattice spacing are governed by the higgs vev along with other parameters of the gauge theory .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this idea was extended to supersymmetric gauge theories in four - dimensions , and the quiver @xmath229 theory was the starting point for deconstruction of _ two _ extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> one takes a set of @xmath1 d3-branes probing a @xmath2 orbifold . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath3 happens to be large , then the resulting wedge of @xmath231 is like a thin sliver . </S>",
    "<S> the d3-branes are moved away from the orbifold point to a distance @xmath232 . in the dual gauge theory </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to giving a vev to the bifundamental hypermultiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the d3-branes are now in a very thin cone , and being away from the tip , they essentially can be considered to be in a cylindrical geometry where the radius of the transverse circle is @xmath233 . for large @xmath3 , when this radius is vanishingly small in string units , one can t - dualize and work with d4-branes wrapping a dual circle of radius @xmath234 . </S>",
    "<S> the type iia coupling constant is @xmath235 .    </S>",

    "<S> we now see that the conventional @xmath5 limit and the limit of ref.@xcite probe opposite ends of the dlcq compactification moduli space , with the former corresponding to @xmath250 and the latter corresponding to @xmath251 . by a double scaling of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , we have succeeded in retaining the dlcq radius as a tunable parameter .    * . </S>",
    "<S> discussion *    we end with some final comments and speculate about using the large moose / quiver theory as a definition of m - theory .    _ . </S>",
    "<S> concluding comments _    our work indicates several interesting directions to explore . </S>",
    "<S> one such direction is to consider @xmath117 superconformal gauge theories obtained by placing @xmath1 d3-branes at a @xmath252 orbifold singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the holographically dual @xmath253 background naturally admits three different pp - wave limits . </S>",
    "<S> two of these are dlcq pp - wave backgrounds with an orbifold in the transverse space , hence they have reduced supersymmetry . the third limit , which is more interesting , gives a maximally supersymmetric pp - wave . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding quiver diagram is a two - dimensional discretized torus , and the gauge theory operators wind along a diagonal of this torus , sampling all the @xmath254 points @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative description of the @xmath0 quiver theory that we studied in this paper is provided by a type iia brane construction in terms of ns5 and d4-branes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this construction lifts to m - theory as an m5-brane wrapped on a riemann surface </S>",
    "<S> . it would be worthwhile to examine whether this approach , in our scaling limit , can be related to the non - relativistic membrane theory that we have exhibited here .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting study , similar to the deconstruction idea , deals with the matrix theory description of our quiver theory @xcite . in this work , a relation is found between @xmath204 and @xmath255 quiver theories . </S>",
    "<S> this exchange of @xmath1 and @xmath3 is reminiscent of the t - duality that we perform , and might have implications for it .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the dlcq formalism is intended to facilitate the study of string interactions in a controlled fashion . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly important to understand string interactions within the gauge theory / pp - wave correspondence , and the framework provided in this paper should be useful to address this issue .    _ . </S>",
    "<S> might ` m ' mean ` moose ' ? _    in this paper we considered a particular limit of the @xmath0 moose / quiver theory in which </S>",
    "<S> not only @xmath1 and @xmath3 are taken to be larger , but at the same time one focusses on a particular sector of the theory : only operators are considered for which @xmath98 and @xmath91 grow like @xmath3 and @xmath40 and @xmath102 are kept finite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter conditions imply that the operators are constructed mostly out of @xmath83 fields . in principle </S>",
    "<S> one could have chosen to look at a different sector for which another combination of @xmath98 and the charges is kept finite leading to operators that contain for example mostly @xmath256 , @xmath84 or @xmath257 fields . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to suggest that the large moose / quiver theory may be even richer and may contain all kinds of sectors that we have not yet explored .    </S>",
    "<S> this brings us to an important question : is one allowed to send @xmath1 and @xmath3 to infinity without taking the string coupling to zero ? or does this only makes sense provided one also restricts to an appropriate subset of operators ? to see why this is an important question , let us assume that one _ can _ make sense of the large moose / quiver theory without any severe restrictions on the coupling or the class of operators one is considering . in that case one expects that the resulting theory is dual to type iib string theory on @xmath44 in limit where the radius of the @xmath32 and the @xmath9 both go to infinity , while taking also the order @xmath3 of the @xmath12 orbifold group to infinity . without the orbifold identification one would , at least naively , expect to get the type iib theory in a flat background . </S>",
    "<S> one of the spatial direction is , however , infinitely small due to the orbifold symmetry , and hence should be replaced by a t - dual coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a type iia theory in flat space but with a coupling constant that becomes infinite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the large @xmath1 and @xmath3 limit of the moose / quiver theory , if it exists , is a serious candidate for a non - perturbative description of type iia string theory , that is of @xmath226-theory ! </S>",
    "<S> so we may ask : `` might m mean moose ? '' </S>"
