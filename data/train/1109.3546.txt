    "@xcite to the lower density and lower temperature domain .",
    "the important theoretical refinement discussed here for the first time , in the context of laser generated low density @xmath13 plasma , is the consideration of the plasmon screening depending on plasma temperature and density .",
    "we also extend our earlier considerations to the nonrelativistic regime @xmath14 as required in the study of the plasma expansion and freeze - out process .    under the experimental conditions we consider here , all photons produced",
    "will escape from the small drop of low density plasma of electrons and positrons without much , if any , scattering .",
    "however , even far from the chemical equilibrium density of the particle pair yield , it is possible for the produced electrons and positrons to equilibrate thermally by means of mller and bhabha scattering , @xmath15 forming an electron - positron plasma drop : wwhen the drop size @xmath16 exceeds the scattering length @xmath17 , @xmath18 multiple scattering processes can occur , allowing kinetic `` thermal '' equilibration .",

    "[ eannih ] that the energy loss relaxation time @xmath184 becomes very close to @xmath185 for @xmath153 , since the energy of the plasma drop changes mostly because of the pair mass disappearance and the resulting decrease in plasma mass . at @xmath186 ,",
    "the energy loss relaxation time is , as expected , above the annihilation relaxation time .",

    "can be thermally equilibrated at the density and temperature range considered , far below the chemical equilibrium of the pair yield , @xmath194 .",
    "the plasma drop size allows very many scattering processes ; we did not find any restriction on the minimum plasma drop energy and/or maximum drop size by considering the opaqueness condition eq.([efreezout ] ) for electron ( positron ) scattering .",
    "we calculated , as an example , the annihilation relaxation time for an internal plasma drop energy of 0.3  1.2 kj and radius 3 @xmath3 m . because of the relatively low density the annihilation relaxation time is much longer than the pulse duration , which is @xmath195 fs .",
    "we found that in - flight annihilation is fastest at @xmath196 mev , yet still relatively slow .",
    "the radiative positronium production process exceeds the in - flight annihilation at a much lower temperature , 60 ev , leading perhaps to the formation of positronium in the late stages of the drop .",
    "if such a low temperature is reached without drastic expansion dilution , very many positroniums can be formed , and positronium formation prolongs the life span of positrons , though the nature of the plasma drop is now different .",
