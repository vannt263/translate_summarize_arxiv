    "thus , in principle , all the information about the representation @xmath22 is encoded in the distribution @xmath21 .",
    "for example the group action is given by @xmath26 this is why @xmath21 is called an intertwining distribution @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath21 happens to be the weyl symbol , @xcite , of the operator , see below .",
    "often @xmath21 may be computed in terms of the distribution character @xmath27 of @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "if the group @xmath1 is compact then the distribution character @xmath28 may also be recovered from @xmath21 via an explicit formula , , @xcite .",
    "thus we have a diagram @xmath29 the asymptotic properties of @xmath21 determine the associated varieties of the primitive ideals of @xmath5 and @xmath7 and , under some more assumptions , the wave front sets of these representations , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we believe that in general one should be able to have a diagram like with the arrows in arbitrary direction . in particular deciding whether two representations are in howe s correspondence should be done by comparing the intertwining distributions obtained from their characters .",
    "the usual , often very successful , approach to howe s correspondence avoids any work with the distributions on the symplectic space .",
    "instead , one finds langlands parameters ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , character formulas ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , or candidates for character formulas ( as in @xcite ) , or one establishes preservation of unitarity ( as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",

    "we consider the dual pairs with @xmath1 compact .",
    "then the representations @xmath5 and @xmath7 are the irreducible unitary highest weight representations .",
    "they have been defined by harish - chandra in @xcite and were classified in @xcite .",
    "they have been studied in terms of zuckerman functors in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    as a complementary contribution to all this work",
    ", we compute the intertwining distributions @xmath21 explicitly . our formula for the intertwining distribution @xmath21 is explicit enough to find its asymptotics , see theorem [ the dilation limit of intertwining distribution ] .",
    "these allow us to compute the wave front set of the representation @xmath7 within the classical invariant theory , without using @xcite .",
    "see corollary [ wf of pi ] below .",
    "also , in the case when both groups are compact , we have the diagram with the arrows in arbitrary direction",
    ". therefore we see which representations @xmath5 and @xmath7 occur in howe s correspondence , which corresponds to which and we recover the fact that @xmath22 occurs with multiplicity one without using @xcite or @xcite .",
