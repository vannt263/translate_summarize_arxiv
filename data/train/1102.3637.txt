    "the notion of slope-(semi)stability for vector bundles on a smooth projective varieties over an algebraically closed field @xmath1 , as introduced by d. mumford in the case of curves and generalized by f. takemoto to higher dimensional varieties , is a very important tool in algebraic geometry .",

    "one of the most important results in this direction , due to h. brenner , is a combinatorial criterion for ( semi)stability of syzygy bundles given by monomial families :    [ monomialcase ] let @xmath1 be a field , @xmath21 $ ] and let @xmath22 denote @xmath16-primary monomials of degrees @xmath23 in @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 .",

    "we use the results obtained in section 5 and construct an example for a stable syzygy bundle in this case , which gives the generic result via the openness of stability .    in the final section we provide another application of the semistability algorithm concerning the computation of tight / solid closure of homogeneous ideals in the coordinate ring of a smooth projective curve .",
