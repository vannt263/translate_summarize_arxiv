    "the ground state is not the classically expected ferromagnetic phase in the absence of external field , since the reference ferromagnetic state is destabilized by the fluctuation of the bound - magnon pairs .",
    "the fm / nematic phase transition in zero field may be 1st - order due to a substantial difference in magnetization , similar to the case of the square lattice.@xcite    here , we analyze the properties of the bound magnon condensed phase .",
    "the wave function of the bound - magnon pair is given by @xmath171 where @xmath172 and we have omitted the normalization constant . note that we have translated the momentum @xmath173 of @xmath174 by @xmath175 in comparison with the definition in appendix b2 to see the symmetry of the bound state clearly .",
    "the symmetry of this wave function @xmath176 corresponds to the space symmetry of spin nematic order.@xcite hence , the nematic order parameter , which is dominant on the nearest neighbor bonds , has the @xmath177-wave symmetry and oscillates with the wave vector @xmath178 in the form @xmath179 where @xmath180 denotes the density of condensed two - magnon bound states and @xmath181 denotes the rotation angle of directors about @xmath182-axis .    finally , let us discuss the possibility of magnetization jump below the saturation field , which we do not exclude from the present analysis .",
    "even if the magnetization jumps , we still expect the appearance of the spin nematic phase below the magnetization jump .",
    "it should be noted that the spin nematic phase may seriously compete with a single magnon bec phase below the jump since the binding energy is extremely small . to investigate the full magnetization curve",
    ", we also performed an exact diagonalization analysis of finite size systems up to @xmath183 spins .",
    "we found a signature of magnetization jump below the saturation and the appearance of spin nematic phase below the jump .",
    "this tendency toward the spin nematic ordering continues down to zero magnetization , but it is difficult to conclude the nature in the thermodynamic limit because of the large size dependence in contrast to the small binding energy .",
    "this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed effects of quantum fluctuations in quantum frustrated ferromagnets under high magnetic field . in general , in the vicinity of the classical boundary between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases , a non - classical phase or phase separation must appear , at least in the high - magnetic - field regime near the saturation field , if the classical antiferromagnetic state is not an eigenstate of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "we stress that the phase separation can occur even in the isotropic heisenberg model and it is purely a quantum phenomenon .    as a concrete model satisfying the above condition , we study the @xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath2 model on the bcc lattice , using a dilute - bose - gas approach . the result is summarized in table  [ table : phasetransition ] .",
    "we found that for @xmath6 , the low - density single magnon condensed phase is not stable near the saturation field and the phase separation occurs between a low - magnetization phase and the fully polarized ferromagnetic phase , accompanied with a magnetization jump .",
    "we also found that for @xmath167 the bound magnon pairs are stabilized , leading to a spin nematic phase .",
    "when the density of magnons is higher than a certain amount , i.e. , the magnetization is low , the competition between the spin nematic phase and the single magnon bec phase might be crucial , since the binding energy is extremely small .",
    "it is beyond the scope of our paper to determine which phase actually appears near zero field .",
    "finally , let us comment on the possibility of the efimov effect .",

    ", in our case , the stable bound state has a @xmath5-wave symmetry , instead of the @xmath184-wave symmetry , which implies the scattering is not simple .",
    "hence , the application of the efimov s argument to our model may not be straightforward .",
