    "for more than two decades the intensive numerical work on the spin glass ( sg ) problem has been concentrated almost exclusively on the edwards - anderson ising spin glass : ising spins on a regular [ hyper]cubic lattice with random near neighbor gaussian or binomial interaction distributions @xcite .",
    "the many possible alternative ising systems with a randomness ingredient have hardly been touched on and such results as exist have been largely ignored .",
    "one such family of alternative systems was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a 2d square lattice of @xmath1 ising spins @xmath2 with uniform ferromagnetic second near neighbor interactions of strength @xmath3 , plus random near neighbor interactions @xmath4 ; we will refer to it as the rcf ( randomly coupled ferromagnet ) model @xcite .",
    "it is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath5}j\\sigma_i\\sigma_j\\,.\\ ] ] for each realization of the randomness the @xmath6 are drawn with the constraint @xmath7 to reduce fluctuations .",
    "as the spins are coupled through the ferromagnetic second near neighbor interactions , the system can be partitioned into two inter - penetrating sublattices in checkerboard - like fashion . in the limit @xmath8 the two sublattices order ferromagnetically and independently below the onsager temperature @xmath9 . because each sublattice can order up or down , there are four degenerate ground states . as was pointed out in @xcite , for non - zero @xmath10 the near neighbor interactions can be considered in terms of effective random fields exerted by each sublattice on the other , so that for finite @xmath10 and large enough @xmath11 the ferromagnetic sublattice ordering is expected to be broken up , as in the @xmath0 random field ising ( rfi ) model @xcite .",
    "the ground state will consist of coexisting domains of each of the four types : up / up , up / down , down / up and down / down .",
    "the question is : is the break - up accompanied by paramagnetic order down to @xmath12 ?    a number of monte carlo simulations were performed , and it was concluded on the basis of standard numerical criteria @xcite that when the ratio @xmath10 is less than about @xmath13 , the rcf systems show spin glass like ordering at a _",
    "finite _ temperature , whereas 2d edwards anderson isgs are paramagnetic down to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the finite ordering temperature interpretation was strongly questioned by parisi et al @xcite who criticized the initial work @xcite on the grounds that the results were restricted to relatively small sample sizes l. on the basis of monte carlo data obtained on rather larger samples parisi et al suggested that the rcf systems are always paramagnetic down to @xmath12 , like the edwards anderson isgs . further large sample monte carlo results @xcite however indicated finite - temperature ordering .    here we present data from ground - state configuration evaluations which show unambiguously that rcf systems indeed exhibit finite temperature sg like ordering for @xmath10 less than about @xmath13 .",
    "this opens up new and intriguing possibilities for the testing of fundamental properties of complex ordered systems at finite temperatures in a @xmath0 context .",
    "in the present work , ground state configurations have been found for periodic boundary conditions , and for the case where in one direction the boundary conditions are switched to anti - periodic . by comparing the ground state energies of the different boundary conditions for each realization conclusions on the ordering behavior can be obtained .",
    "similar studies were performed for simple @xmath14-dimensional ea spin glasses in @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xcite .    for readers not familiar with the calculation of spin - glass ground states now a short introduction to the subject and a description of the algorithm used here are given .",
    "a detailed overview can be found in @xcite    the concept of _ frustration _",
    "@xcite is important for understanding the behavior of @xmath18 ising spin glasses .",
    "the simplest example of a frustrated system is a triple of spins where all pairs are connected by antiferromagnetic bonds , see fig .",
    "[ fig_triangle ]",
    ". a bond is called _ satisfied _ if it contributes with a negative value to the total energy by choosing the values of its adjacent spins properly . for the triangle",
    "it is not possible to find a spin - configuration were all bonds are satisfied . in general a system",
    "is frustrated if closed loops of bonds exists , where the product of these bond - values is negative . for square and cubic systems",
    "the smallest closed loops consist of four bonds .",
    "they are called ( elementary ) _",
    "plaquettes_.    as we will see later the presence of frustration makes the calculation of exact ground states of such systems computationally hard . only for the special case of the two - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions in no more than one direction and without external field a polynomial - time algorithm",
    "is known @xcite . in general only methods with exponential running times",
    "are known , on says the problem is _ np - hard _ @xcite .",
    "now for the general case three basic methods are briefly reviewed and the largest system sizes which can be treated are given for three - dimensional systems , the standard spin - glass model , were data for comparison is available .",
    "the simplest method works by enumerating all @xmath19 possible states and has obviously an exponential running time .",
    "even a system size of @xmath20 is too large .",
    "the basic idea of the so called _ branch - and - bound _",
    "algorithm @xcite is to exclude the parts of the state space , where no low - lying states can be found , so that the complete low - energy landscape of systems of size @xmath20 can be calculated @xcite .    a more sophisticated method called _ branch - and - cut _",
    "@xcite works by rewriting the quadratic energy function as a linear function with an additional set of inequalities which must hold for the feasible solutions .",
    "since not all inequalities are known a priori the method iteratively solves the linear problem , looks for inequalities which are violated , and adds them to the set until the solution is found . since the number of inequalities grows exponentially with the system size the same holds for the computation time of the algorithm . with branch - and - cut anyway small systems up to @xmath21 are feasible .",
    "the method used here is able to calculate true ground states @xcite up to size @xmath22 . for two - dimensional systems , as considered in this paper , sizes up to @xmath23 can be treated .",
    "the method is based on a special genetic algorithm @xcite and on _ cluster - exact approximation _ @xcite .",
    "cea is an optimization method designed specially for spin glasses .",
    "its basic idea is to transform the spin glass in a way that graph - theoretical methods can be applied , which work only for systems exhibiting no frustrations . next",
    "a description of the genetic cea is given .",
    "genetic algorithms are biologically motivated .",
    "an optimal solution is found by treating many instances of the problem in parallel , keeping only better instances and replacing bad ones by new ones ( survival of the fittest ) .",
    "the genetic algorithm starts with an initial population of @xmath24 randomly initialized spin configurations (= _ individuals _ ) , which are linearly arranged using an array .",
    "the last one is also neighbor of the first one .",
    "then @xmath25 times two neighbors from the population are taken ( called _ parents _ ) and two new configurations called _ offspring _ are created . for that purpose",
    "the _ triadic crossover _ is used which turned out to be very efficient for spin glasses : a mask is used which is a third randomly chosen ( usually distant ) member of the population with a fraction of @xmath26 of its spins reversed . in a first step the offspring are created as copies of the parents .",
    "then those spins are selected , where the orientations of the first parent and the mask agree @xcite .",
    "the values of these spins are swapped between the two offspring",
    ". then a _ mutation _ with a rate of @xmath27 is applied to each offspring , i.e. a fraction @xmath27 of the spins is reversed .",
    "next for both offspring the energy is reduced by applying cea : the method constructs iteratively and randomly a non - frustrated cluster of spins .",
    "spins adjacent to many unsatisfied bonds are more likely to be added to the cluster . during the construction of the cluster a local gauge - transformation of the spin variables",
    "is applied so that all interactions between cluster spins become ferromagnetic .",
    "[ fig_cea_example ] shows an example of how the construction of the cluster works using a small spin - glass system . for 2d @xmath18 spin glasses",
    "each cluster contains typically 70 percent of all spins . the non - cluster spins",
    "act like local magnetic fields on the cluster spins , so the ground state of the cluster is not trivial .",
    "since the cluster has only ferromagnetic interactions , an energetic minimum state for its spins can be calculated in polynomial time by using graph theoretical methods @xcite : an equivalent network is constructed @xcite , the maximum flow @xcite is calculated with level(@xmath28 ) = level(@xmath29)+1 , but also all edges @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sink . for this measure , we observed an additional speed - up of roughly factor 2 for the systems we calculated . ] and the spins of the cluster are set to their orientations leading to a minimum in energy .",
    "this minimization step is performed @xmath32 times for each offspring .",
    "afterwards each offspring is compared with one of its parents .",
    "the pairs are chosen in the way that the sum of the phenotypic differences between them is minimal .",
    "the phenotypic difference is defined here as the number of spins where the two configurations differ .",
    "each parent is replaced if its energy is not lower ( i.e. not better ) than the corresponding offspring .",
    "after this whole step is done @xmath25 times , the population is halved : from each pair of neighbors the configuration which has the higher energy is eliminated . if more than 4 individuals remain the process is continued otherwise it is stopped and the best individual is taken as result of the calculation .    the representation in fig .",
    "[ fig_algo ] summarizes the algorithm .",
    "the whole algorithm is performed @xmath33 times and all configurations which exhibit the lowest energy are stored , resulting in @xmath34 statistical independent ground state configurations .",
    "the running time of the algorithm with suitable parameters chosen ( see table i ) grows exponentially with the system size . on a 80mhz powerpc processor",
    "a typical @xmath35 instance takes 3 hours ( 15 hours for @xmath36 ) .",
    "in this work ground states of the rcf are studied for system sizes up to @xmath36 and values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "usually 1000 different realizations were treated , each submitted to periodic ( pbc ) and antiperiodic ( apbc ) boundary conditions in one direction and always pbc in the other direction .",
    "the apbc are realized by inverting one line of bonds in the system with pbc . because of the enormous computational effort , for the largest system sizes only realizations with @xmath41 where considered with large statistics ( and about 100 realizations with @xmath42 ) .",
    "the periodic ground states give a direct measurement of the @xmath12 break up length @xmath43 at each value of @xmath10 , which is defined as follows : for small enough @xmath11 the ground states will always be such that there is a full ferromagnetic ordering within each sublattice . with increasing @xmath11 , more and more samples will be found with ground states having at least one of the sublattices incompletely ferromagnetic .",
    "the break up length @xmath43 is defined @xcite as the value of @xmath11 above which more than half the samples do not have pure ferromagnetic order in each sublattice . for the binomial rfi model , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the strength of the random field @xcite . for the rcf the values of @xmath43",
    "are shown against @xmath46 in figure 1 .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that by analogy with the rfi results @xcite @xmath47 could be expected to vary as @xmath48 .",
    "in fact the data points for the true ground states lie on the line @xmath49 . for the particular cases @xmath37 and @xmath41 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively",
    ". with the wisdom of hindsight , it can be seen that the measurements done in @xcite for @xmath37 were mainly in the regime @xmath52 while for @xmath53 the larger samples were well in the regime @xmath54 .",
    "a `` typical '' ground state for @xmath55 and @xmath36 is shown in figure [ figsamplestate ] .",
    "all four possible types of domains occur . because of the discrete structure of the interaction usually the ground state is degenerate .",
    "but in contrast to the ea spin glasses with only @xmath18 near neighbor interactions , where a complex ground - state landscape exists , the structure of the degeneracy is trivial for @xmath56 : the whole system may be flipped , sometimes it is possible to flip both sublattices independently , and usually some small clusters occur with can take two orientations .    but for studying whether the model exhibits long range order or not , it is sufficient to concentrate on the ground - state energies @xmath57 for periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the energy differences @xmath58 give information about whether a system exhibits some kind of stiffness against perturbations of the boundary , i.e. about the presence of order .",
    "@xmath59 is called the _",
    "stiffness energy_. for samples with the same set of interactions the stiffness can be analyzed in terms of the size dependence of the average @xmath60 and of the width @xmath61 of the distribution @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath41 the distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ figdistrdeltamean ] .",
    "the inset shows the behavior of the average stiffness energy as a function of @xmath11 for all four values of @xmath10 . for system sizes larger the breakup length and @xmath63 the stiffness energy decreases , indicating that no ferromagnetic long range order is present in the system .",
    "for @xmath37 the breakup length is very large , so the asymptotic behavior is hardly visible , but @xmath64 seems to fall for @xmath65 . from direct evaluation of the magnetization ( see fig [ figmaglambda ] and fig . [ figlambdakl ] ) we conclude that no ferromagnetic order should be present beyond an upper limit @xmath66 . for smaller values of @xmath10 nothing",
    "can be concluded from our data .",
    "furthermore , for smaller values of @xmath10 it remains possible that the ground states of the rcf model do not exhibit ferromagnetic ordering ordering for any finite value of the relative coupling constant @xmath10 .    from standard relationships @xcite",
    "one can write @xmath67 with @xmath68 the ferromagnetic stiffness exponent , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 the spin glass stiffness exponent . positive values of the exponents indicate a long range order . because of the small system sizes an evaluation of the ferromagnetic exponent is difficult . from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ figdistrdeltamean ] we find an asymptotic ( @xmath71 ) value of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "now we turn to the question whether some kind of spin - glass order is present in the system .",
    "this can be investigated by analyzing the dependence of the variance @xmath74 of the stiffness - energy distributions on the system size , the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ figwidthdelta ] . for small",
    "system sizes the variance grows for all values of the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "in order to exclude finite - size effects , only systems larger than the breakup length @xmath47 should be taken into account .",
    "above @xmath43 there is a good linear size dependence of @xmath75 against @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 respectively for @xmath81 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the values of @xmath82 against @xmath10 are shown in the inset of figure [ figwidthdelta ] .",
    "the result for @xmath37 is not very reliable , because the largest system size is of the order of the breakup length . in the log - log plot",
    "the datapoints for @xmath37 exhibit a negative curvature , thus the asymptotic value of @xmath70 may be smaller than @xmath83 . for the other systems the breakup length is quite small ,",
    "so the results give unambiguous evidence for spin glass like ordering in the large size limit , with a non - zero ordering temperature . especially for @xmath41 , where @xmath84 , the result @xmath85 is very reliable .",
    "thus , it is indeed not necessary to carry out further calculations with larger systems to prove the fact , there there are values of the coupling constant giving rise to an ordered spin glass phase in the rcf .",
    "the limiting value @xmath86 above which @xmath70 is negative is very close to @xmath87 ; @xmath86 would correspond to the highest value at which the ordering temperature is non - zero , in good agreement with the initial estimate from the monte carlo work @xcite .",
    "we have calculated ground states of the randomly coupled ferromagnet for different values of the spin - glass coupling constant @xmath10 and with periodic as well as antiperiodic boundary conditions . by using the genetic cluster - exact approximation algorithm",
    ", we were able to treat system sizes up to @xmath88 .",
    "the breakup length was calculated for each value of @xmath10 . from the calculation of @xmath12",
    "stiffness energy it could be concluded that below @xmath89 the rcf exhibits an ordered spin glass like phase at finite temperature .",
    "it should be stressed again that for @xmath90 the largest system sizes are well beyond the breakup length , so no changes are to be expected for larger system sizes . for @xmath91 , especially if one likes to test whether the model exhibits ferromagnetic ordering , ground states calculations of larger systems are needed to study the behavior in more detail .",
    "unfortunatley , these studies are beyond the power of current computers and algorithms .    although the zero - temperature stiffness exponent values give no direct information on the ordering temperatures , the present results are consistent with the the conclusions drawn in @xcite where monte carlo estimates of the critical temperatures were made using the finite - size scaling of the spin glass susceptibility and the form of the time dependence of the autocorrelation function relaxation .",
    "ordering temperatures were estimated to be close to @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath38 , dropping to zero near @xmath94 .",
    "rather remarkably the @xmath12 crossover as a function of @xmath11 at @xmath43 appears to have little effect on the behavior of the sg susceptibility as a function of size in the temperature region close to @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "however for @xmath96 parisi et al @xcite observed weakly non - monotonic behavior of the binder parameter with @xmath11 for sizes that we now know to be in the region of the crossover .",
    "since the existence of a spin glass like phase at finite temperature now has been established definitely , it would be instructive to carry out further careful monte carlo measurements for sample sizes well in the regime @xmath97 and over a range of @xmath10 values . is the physics of the @xmath0 rcf above , at , and below the ordering temperature strictly analogous to that of the standard edwards anderson isg at dimensions where there is finite temperature ordering ?",
    "to what extent could the rcf enlighten us concerning problems which in the edwards anderson isg context have remained conflictual for more than twenty years ?",
    "the fact that the rcf lives on a @xmath0 lattice rather than in a higher dimension should facilitate understanding of the fundamental physics of ordering in complex systems .",
    "finally , there may even be possible experimental realizations of systems where quasi - two - dimensional magnets form short range clusters with local ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order , with random frustrated interactions linking these clusters together .",
    "examples of promising behaviour of this sort are fe compound with halogens @xcite where it might be interesting to look at the data again in view of the present results .",
