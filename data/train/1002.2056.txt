    "modifications of the theory of general relativity ( gr ) by including higher order corrections to the theory were first introduced by herman weyl @xcite as early as 1918 , just three years after einstein completed his theory of general relativity .",
    "weyl proposed modifications to the theory by including higher order invariants in the action , in order to extend general relativity s geometrical foundations . in 1921 , arthur eddington also began to consider fourth order theories of gravity and went on to publish his famous book : _ the mathematical theory of relativity _",
    "@xcite , which contained work on generalized versions of weyl s theory .",
    "ever since , there has been a great number of gravitational theories proposing modifications to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "originally the motivation for considering modified theories of gravity stems from limitations of general relativity when considering strong gravity regimes .",
    "more recently however , corrections to gr have been proposed to account for the dark sector of the universe .",
    "studies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , supernovae type ia surveys @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite indicate that the energy density budget of the universe is @xmath4 ordinary matter ( baryons , radiation and neutrinos ) , @xmath5 dark matter and @xmath6 dark energy .",
    "dark matter is responsible for the gravitational clumping of galaxies , galaxy clusters and large - scale structures , whilst dark energy is linked to the current phase of accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the @xmath7cdm model ( _ concordance model _ ) is currently the best fit model , using the cosmological constant @xmath8 to explain dark energy .",
    "an alternative explanation is to consider that on cosmological scales , the current description of gravity is incomplete and a modification to the theory is needed .",
    "one of the most popular modifications to gravity which has been proposed to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe , without the need for dark energy , is @xmath0 gravity , which represents a generalization of einstein - hilbert action by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath9 with the function @xmath0 .",
    "these fourth order theories have been shown to and give rise to a phase of accelerated expansion without the need for dark energy @xcite and to account for the rotation curves for spiral galaxies without the need for dark matter @xcite .",
    "a good theory of gravity is clearly one that agrees with observations .",
    "one of the first experimental verifications of gr was the measurement of the bending of light , observed for the first time by eddington in 1919 during a total solar eclipse .",
    "since then , gravitational lensing has been a powerful tool used to determine the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters and to put constraints on scales as small as stars to large scale structures and cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "given that the lensing effect is dependent on the underlying theory of gravity , investigating modifications of gr would result in deviations from the standard expression of the deflection angle and is consequently worth investigating .",
    "the derivation of the form of the lensing angle for @xmath0 theory has already been presented in @xcite and @xcite using different methods .    in this paper",
    "we use covariant method to find general expressions for the propagation of null geodesics in static spherically symmetric spacetimes in @xmath0 gravity theories .",
    "the solutions of these equations are then used to obtain a general expression for the deflection angle for spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ fourthorder ]",
    "we present the general equations for @xmath0 gravity . in section [ covariantapproach ]",
    "we apply the1 + 1 + 2 covariant approach to static spherical symmetric spacetimes in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the propagation of null geodesics is considered in section [ lensgeometry ] and then calculated explicitly for the case of @xmath10 in static spherically symmetric spacetime in order to determine the bending angle in section [ lensapplication ] .",

    "the symbol @xmath12 represents the usual covariant derivative and @xmath13 corresponds to partial differentiation .",

    "in a completely general context , a fourth order theory of gravity is obtained by adding the terms involving @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 to the standard einstein hilbert action .",
    "however , we know the gauss - bonnet term @xmath23 is a total differential in four dimensions and hence do not affect the field equations . using this symmetry",
    "we can rewrite @xmath22 in terms of the other two .",
    "furthermore , if the spacetime is highly symmetric , then the variation of the term @xmath21 can always be rewritten in terms of the variation of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it follows that the sufficiently general fourth - order lagrangian for a highly symmetric spacetime only contains powers of @xmath9 and we can , with out loss of generality , write the action as = 12 d^4x , [ action ] where @xmath25 represents the matter contribution and @xmath7 is the usual cosmological constant .",

    "we know that the 1 + 3 covariant approach , initially developed by ehlers and ellis @xcite has proven to be a very useful technique in many aspects of relativistic cosmology , in cosmology these methods have been applied to the formalism and evolution of density perturbations in the universe @xcite and to the physics of cosmic microwave background @xcite amongst other things .",
    "this approach is based on a 1 + 3 threading decomposition of the spacetime manifold w.r.t a timelike congruence as a splitting of spacetime onto a timelike and an orthogonal three - dimensional spacelike hypersurface .",
    "all the essential information in the system is captured in a set of kinematic and dynamic 1 + 3 variables that have a well defined physical and geometrical significance and that satisfy a set of evolution and constraint equations derived from the bianchi and ricci identities , forming a closed system of equations for a chosen equation of state describing matter .    a natural extension to the 1 + 3 approach , optimized for problems",
    "which have spherical symmetry , is the 1 + 1 + 2 formalism developed recently by clarkson and barrett @xcite . in this formalism ,",
    "a further splitting of the spacelike 1 + 3 variables is performed such that it isolates a specific spatial direction .",
    "this allows for the derivation of a set of variables that are more advantageous to treat systems with one preferred direction .",
    "for example in spherically symmetric system the equation for the 1 + 1 + 2 variables are scalar equations and are much simpler than the ones of the 1 + 3 formalism which are in general tensorial .",
