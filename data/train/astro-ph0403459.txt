    "high - magnification microlensing events are exceptionally sensitive to the presence of planetary companions to the lens . as the projected separation of the source and the ( parent - star ) lens decreases , the size of the images increases , thus enhancing the probability that the planet will pass close enough to an image to generate a noticeable deviation in the lightcurve @xcite . and if the source gets sufficiently close to the lens , the lightcurve can be perturbed by the central caustic associated with the parent star itself @xcite .",
    "groups that monitor microlensing events to search for planets are well aware of this enhanced sensitivity and so devote special attention to these events .",
    "it is therefore somewhat surprising that the vast majority of events monitored by these groups in the past have not been particularly high - magnification , and the vast majority of the observations of the few that did reach high magnification were actually performed well away from the peak , when the event had far less sensitivity to planets . in particular , of the 43 events monitored by the planet ( probing lensing anomalies network ) collaboration @xcite over 5 years , most of the sensitivity to planets came from just 5 or 6 events , and most of that from the near - peak regions of these events . @xcite and @xcite used the relatively sparse ogle data to put limits on planetary systems , although @xcite have argued that planets could not be reliably detected from such data alone .",
    "the main reason for this apparent discrepancy was simply a shortage of microlensing alerts .",
    "hence , at any given time , there just were no high - magnification events in progress , or at least none near their peak .",
    "the available telescope time then had to be applied to less favorable events .",
    "in addition , when devising their observational strategy , planet considered that they would have to characterize the events they were monitoring entirely with their own data . such characterization is absolutely essential to evaluating the sensitivity of each event to planets , and it requires a very large number of observations on the wings and at baseline when the event has very little sensitivity to planets .    with the commencement of the optical gravitational lens experiment s ogle - iii project @xcite ,",
    "the situation is radically changed . using its dedicated 1.3 m telescope , large - format ( @xmath2 ) camera , generally excellent seeing , and ambitious observing strategy , ogle - iii is alerting microlensing events toward the galactic bulge at a rate of 500 per season . since microlensing events are uniformly distributed in impact parameter @xmath3 , and since peak magnification scales @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) , this implies that there are dozens of events with @xmath6 each year , and a handful with @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , ogle - iii photometry is publicly available ( literally hours after it is taken ) , so there is generally no need for microlensing followup groups to monitor the wings or baseline in order to characterize the event .",
    "that is , followup observing time can be concentrated on the highly sensitive peaks of the high - magnification events . in the 2003 season",
    ", such peaks were occurring almost continuously .",
    "ogle - iii is therefore generating substantial new opportunities for microlensing planet search groups such as planet @xcite , the microlensing planet search ( mps , @xcite ) , and the microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath8fun , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the ogle - iii approach also generates substantial challenges . in order to monitor a very large area during the 2002 and 2003 seasons ,",
    "ogle - iii returned to each field only of order 50 times over the roughly 9 month season . during the long nights around 21 june , when the bulge transits near midnight , the cadence was relatively high , once every two or three nights .",
    "but at the edges of bulge season , the rate of return dropped as low as once per week or less .",
    "hence , some extremely high magnification events appeared quite ordinary as of their last observation before peak , and then could be recognized for what they were only very close to ( or past ) their peak .",
    "indeed , it is quite possible that their true nature as high magnification events could not be recognized at all from the ogle - iii lightcurve alone .",
    "thus , without additional work , the riches generated by ogle - iii could easily pass by unnoticed .",
    "beginning in the 2004 season , ogle adjusted its strategy to concentrate on a reduced number of fields that have relatively higher expected event rates .",
    "hence , it is expected that the above - mentioned problems will be mitigated in future seasons .    here",
    "we develop a new method of modeling microlensing events that incorporates both a galactic model via a monte carlo simulation and the constraints imposed by the observed characteristics of the event .",
    "we apply this method to the extreme microlensing event ( eme ) ogle-2003-blg-423 , which at @xmath9 , proves to have the highest magnification ever recorded among single - lens events .",
    "as such , the event also has the greatest potential sensitivity to planetary companions of the lens , with substantial probability of detecting even neptune mass planets , whose event timescale would typically be only about 6 hours .",
    "this enhanced sensitivity poses special challenges to the analysis because both the form and amplitude of the impact of such small planets on the lightcurve will depend on the relative size of the source compared to the einstein ring .",
    "if this relative size were known , it would be straightforward to calculate its effect .",
    "however , since the lightcurve is consistent with a point source , our information on the source size is limited .",
    "similarly , using the lightcurve data alone the impact parameter @xmath3 is measured only to about 30% .",
    "if @xmath3 were known much more precisely ( as it often is for events with relatively bright sources ) , then we would be able to specify with equal precision where in relation to the einstein ring a planet could be and still avoid detection . with our less perfect knowledge of @xmath3 , however , we must be satisfied with a more probabilistic statement about these locations .",
    "both of these challenges are likely to be generic to the analysis of emes . because such events occur with low probability , their sources are most likely to be the relatively common main - sequence stars that normally lie unnoticed in ground - based bulge images , but which can briefly leap to prominence in an eme .",
    "since these main - sequence stars are faint and hence small , they will most often avoid finite - source effects even in emes .",
    "their faintness also induces large photometric errors in the wings of the lightcurve , the region that must be well - measured to accurately determine @xmath3 . for similar reasons ,",
    "these two challenges are likely to be key issues in future , even more aggressive , microlensing experiments that aim to detect earth - mass planets either by space - based @xcite or ground - based @xcite observations .    in our analysis , we will take as our starting point the method pioneered by @xcite and @xcite , which was then applied to a much larger sample by @xcite .",
    "however , we improve upon this method in several respects",
    ". first , we fix the impact parameter @xmath3 at a series of different values consistent with the event data and evaluate the sensitivity to companions at each @xmath3 . to find the net sensitivity , we must weight each of these outcomes by the relative probability that the actual event had that particular @xmath3 .",
    "second , we determine these relative probabilities not just from the fit to the lightcurve data , but by incorporating the results of a monte carlo simulation of events toward the actual line of sight . for each trial @xmath3 , we weight the simulated events by how well they reproduce both the observed characteristics of the lightcurve and the probability that the source has the luminosity inferred from the lightcurve combined with the monte carlo event parameters , as determined from the hipparcos luminosity distribution at the observed color of the source .",
    "this method not only allows us to more accurately estimate the planetary sensitivity , it also permits us to characterize this sensitivity as a function of planet mass and planet - star separation , since each simulated event has a definite lens mass ( drawn from the adopted mass function ) and definite lens and source distances ( and so definite einstein radius ) .",
    "in contrast , the original approach of @xcite yielded sensitivities in terms of two lightcurve - fit parameters , the planet - star mass ratio and the separation in units of the einstein radius .",
    "this method would also permit a similarly rigorous statistical treatment of finite source effects , since each simulated event has a definite ratio of source size to einstein radius .",
    "however , based on the monte carlo , we show that in the case of ogle-2003-blg-423 , finite - source effects are negligible .",
    "ogle-2003-blg-423 was alerted by the early warning system ( ews , @xcite ) on ut 7:38 14 sept 2003 , almost exactly 24 hours before the peak on hjd@xmath10 hjd@xmath11 , and less than 5 hours after the triggering observation by the ogle - iii observatory in las campanas , chile . while the automated alert did not itself call any more attention to this event than the other three that were alerted simultaneously , the ogle web siteogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html ] immediately affixed a `` ! '' to this event , indicating that it was of special interest . moreover , from the data available at the web site one could see that the event was already 3 mag above baseline and rising rapidly .",
    "see @xcite for a bayesian approach to determine whether ascending microlensing events are likely to achieve high magnification",
    ".    immediately following the alert , @xmath8fun decided to focus its observations heavily upon this event . because the event was triggered relatively late in the season when the bulge is already west of the meridian at twilight , the time per night that it could be observed from any one site was restricted : roughly 1.5 hours from the wise observatory in israel and roughly 4 hours from ctio at la serena , chile .",
    "the gap in coverage between the two observatories was about 6 hours . because of a communication error ,",
    "the chile observations have a gap of 3 hours the first night , but are then generally spaced at roughly 1 hour intervals on subsequent nights .    while ogle - iii normally cycles through many fields ( survey mode ) , it can also operate in followup mode when there is an event of particular interest .",
    "ogle-2003-blg-423 was immediately designated as such an event , but because of communication problems , it was not observed the first night following discovery .",
    "however , it was observed one to four times per night over the next five nights .",
    "when combined , observations from these three observatories provide reasonably good coverage of the peak .",
    "see figure  [ fig : light ] .",

    "our principal concern was that if ogle returned to its regular cycle of observations and @xmath8fun stopped observing the event altogether ( as both would normally do several days after the peak ) , then the ogle and @xmath8fun observations might barely overlap in time , meaning that the two photometry systems could not be rigidly linked into a single lightcurve . to resolve this problem , we agreed to each observe the event several times for the next few nights ( weather permitting ) and to both regularly continue observing it until it got too close to the sun .",
    "there are a total of 278  @xmath16 band images including 150 from ogle , 78 from @xmath8fun chile , and 50 from @xmath8fun israel .",
    "in addition there are 7  @xmath17 band images from @xmath8fun chile , all taken near peak for the purpose of determining the color of the source .",
    "finally , since @xmath8fun chile observations are carried out with an optical / infrared camera , all @xmath17 and @xmath16 images from this location are automatically accompanied by @xmath18 band images . however , even at peak , the event was too faint in @xmath18 for these observations to be useful . for each data",
    "set , the errors were rescaled to make @xmath19 per degree of freedom for the best - fit point - source / point - lens ( pspl ) model equal to unity .",
    "we then eliminated the largest outlier and repeated the process until there were no @xmath20 outliers .",
    "this resulted in the elimination of 1 ogle point , 1 @xmath8fun chile @xmath16 point and 1 @xmath8fun @xmath17 point . in the neighborhood of each of these four outliers",
    ", there are other data points that agree with the pspl model , showing that the outliers are indeed caused by systematic errors rather than revealing unmodeled structure in the lightcurve .",
    "the final rescaling factors were 1.13 and 0.82 for ogle and @xmath8fun chile @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the other two observatory / filter combinations did not require renormalization .",
    "the descriptions of the instruments , observing protocol , and reduction procedures are identical to those given in @xcite .",
    "the photometry is carried out using the dophot - based planet pipeline .",
    "the signature of a planetary companion will usually be a brief excursion from an otherwise `` normal '' point - lens magnification lightcurve .",
    "indeed , as outlined by @xcite , it is often possible to estimate the planet s properties from the gross characteristics of this deviation .",
    "the first step to searching for planets is therefore to fit the lightcurve to a point - lens model @xcite .",
    "however , planetary deviations can be strongly affected by the finite size of the source , even if the rest of the lightcurve is perfectly consistent with a point source , which can lead to degeneracies in the interpretation of the deviation @xcite , or even to a complete failure to detect the deviation .",
    "hence , we begin by presenting the best - fit pspl model , and then investigate to what extent finite - source effects can be detected or constrained within the context of point - lens models .",
    "we fit the data to pspl models , defined by three lensing geometry parameters ( @xmath21 , @xmath3 , and @xmath13 ) as well as a source flux @xmath22 and a blended - light flux @xmath23 for each observatory - filter combination @xmath24 .",

    "note that the source has a dereddened color @xmath40 , almost exactly the same as the sun . the instrumental source color ( and so the source color relative to the clump ) is not model dependent : it can be derived directly from a regression of @xmath17 flux on @xmath16 flux , without reference to any model . if the source suffers similar extinction as the clump , then the source is about 1.4 mag fainter than the sun would be if placed at the distance to the clump , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the sun is somewhat evolved off the main sequence , but the source is still more than 1 mag fainter than zero - age main - sequence stars of the same color and metallicity .",
    "this offset between the source and the main - sequence ( placed at @xmath39 ) hardly changes even if one assumes a substantial difference between the source reddening and the mean reddening toward the clump stars because the reddening vector is nearly parallel to the main sequence .",
    "there are basically only three effects that could contribute to this offset .",

    "as mentioned in   [ sec : data ] , the event was alerted only 24 hours before peak .",
    "the observation just prior to this triggering observation was on 2892.6 , about 4 days previous .",
    "the event was not alerted from that observation because up to that point there were only two detections on the subtracted images , whereas the alert threshold is set at three in order to avoid spurious events .",
    "even had the event been alerted , it would have been flagged as having an impact parameter @xmath114 and therefore would not have been recognized as a high magnification event .",
    "this 4-day cycle time , which was typical for ogle - iii observations in mid - september , introduces significant selection effects in the recovery of emes .",
    "= 3.5truein    the primary effect is to select for long events .",
    "for example , if we consider an event with the same source star , same impact parameter , and same magnification on 2892.6 , but with @xmath13 shorter by a factor 2/3 , then it would not have been discovered until after peak .",
    "that is , such an event would also not have triggered an alert on 2892.6 , but at the 2896.6 observation , at which point it would have already been 0.5 days past peak . by the time followup observations started",
    ", it would have been a day past peak , and so magnified only about 40 times .",
    "while still impressive , this would not have garnered either the attention or the intensive observations triggered by ogle-2003-blg-423 .",
    "thus , the fact that the observed timescale is long compared to that of typical bulge microlensing events is explained largely by selection .",
    "however , this selection effect is already fully accounted for in the monte carlo .",
    "consider a monte carlo event that has a @xmath13 that is much shorter than the best fit in table 1 , say @xmath115days rather than 97 days . this event is assigned a source flux that is lower by a factor @xmath116 so as to reproduce as well as possible the observed lightcurve . in fact , the resulting model lightcurve reproduces the peak region extremely well : most of the @xmath19 difference comes from the post - peak wing , which of course did not enter the selection process .",
    "thus , there is no additional selection discrimination among the monte carlo events .",
    "the event appears to have several `` abnormal '' characteristics relative to typical events as represented in the monte carlo , and it is of interest to determine which of these are brought about by , or enhanced by selection .",
    "the most likely source distance is about 2.5  kpc behind the galactic center . for bulge - bulge lensing",
    ", there is a general selection effect driving toward distant sources because these have larger @xmath45 and so larger cross sections .",
    "see equation  ( [ eqn : weight ] ) .",
    "however , as shown by the dotted lines in the middle right panel of figure  [ fig : hist ] , this effect alone pushes the peak of the distribution back only 1.5  kpc ( 0.7  kpc for bulge - disk lensing ) relative to @xmath39 , not 2.5  kpc .",
    "the pressure toward longer events further selects for more distant sources because their larger @xmath45 make the events longer .",
    "however , since the fwhm of the prior distribution is about 3.5  kpc , the adopted distance would not be extremely unlikely in any case .",
    "another abnormal characteristic is the faintness of the source . up to a point",
    ", the event selection procedure would appear to pick out brighter sources .",
    "as mentioned above , a brighter source would exactly compensate in the selection process for a shorter event , and these are more common than longer events .",
    "however , fainter sources are more common than brighter ones , and this is a larger effect . moreover , as the source brightness increases , so does its angular size , and this eventually cuts off the peak brightness due to finite source effects . based on figure  [ fig : hist ] , however , we have concluded that the source is probably nowhere near this threshold , so this limitation on source size does not enter as a significant factor .    finally , the source appears to be dim for its color .",
    "if the hipparcos distribution is representative of bulge stars of solar color , then this feature would actually be selected against : more luminous stars would be both more numerous and , if lensed by exactly the same lens , more easily recognized before peak .",
    "however , it may be that the hipparcos distribution is not representative of the bulge .",
    "for example , the stars in the outer bulge may have significantly lower metallicity than those in the solar neighborhood , and therefore be fainter at fixed color as is true of subdwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that while a number of the features of this event appear unusual at first sight , most are explained in whole or in part by selection effects .",
    "as discussed in   [ sec : intro ] , @xcite and @xcite have already developed a procedure for searching for planets in microlensing lightcurves , and @xcite have applied this to a sample of 43 events .",
    "for each event , they considered an ensemble of planetary systems characterized by a planet - star mass ratio @xmath117 , a planet - star separation ( in units of the einstein radius ) @xmath118 , and an angle @xmath119 of the source trajectory relative to the planet - star axis .",
    "we will begin by following this procedure , but will introduce several important modifications .    for a given @xmath120 , we define the detection efficiency @xmath121 as the probability that a companion planetary system described by @xmath120 would have produced a lightcurve deviation inconsistent with the observed ogle-2003-blg-423 lightcurve : @xmath122 , \\label{eqn : epsdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the value of @xmath19 evaluated for these three parameters , @xmath124 its best - fit value for the pspl model , and @xmath106 is a step function .",
    "the ( @xmath118 , @xmath117 ) sampling is 0.1 in the log , and the angular step size is set to be @xmath125 in order to avoid missing possible planetary perturbations .",
    "we choose a conservative threshold , @xmath126 @xcite . in this incarnation of the procedure",
    ", we follow @xcite and adopt for @xmath123 the minimum value of @xmath19 with these three parameters held fixed and allowing all other parameters to vary .",
    "the results are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : eff ] .",
    "the curves represent detection efficiencies of 25% , 50% , 75% , and 95% . for @xmath127 ,",
    "companions with separation @xmath128 are completely excluded by the data because they would produce deviations @xmath129 that are not observed .",
    "however , the effect of planetary companions of mass ratio @xmath130 would hardly be discernible .",
    "@xcite discussed a potential shortcoming of this approach : if ( as in the present case ) @xmath3 is not well constrained by the data , then it is possible that for the procedure to say that certain planetary configurations are permitted by the data when in fact they are excluded .",
    "for example , suppose that the measured impact parameter is @xmath131 while the actual value is @xmath132 .",
    "for some value of @xmath119 , the caustic induced by a planet could lie right along the @xmath132 trajectory , but the minimization routine might nevertheless find a path that lay @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) from this value at @xmath135 and so avoided the planetary caustic but with @xmath136 ( see fig .  6 and the accompanying text in @xcite ) .    to counter this shortcoming , we evaluate the sensitivity at each allowed value of @xmath3 .",
    "our search of ( @xmath118 , @xmath117 , @xmath3 ) parameter space reveals no planets .",
    "the best fit is at @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , but the @xmath51 is only @xmath140 , far short of our adopted threshold of @xmath141 .",
    "we evaluate the efficiency by modifying equation  ( [ eqn : epsdef ] ) to become @xmath142 , \\label{eqn : epsdef2}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are now evaluated at fixed @xmath3 . here",
    ", @xmath3 is defined as the projected separation of the source from the center of the caustic induced by the planetary companion .",
    "this is the appropriate generalization from the point - lens case , in which @xmath3 is the projected separation from the ( point - like ) caustic at the position of the primarily lens .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : eff ] shows 50% contours of detection efficiency for several values of @xmath3 that are consistent with the monte carlo simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we present the 50% contours of the @xcite method ( _ solid _ ) and of our new method with @xmath137 and @xmath145 ( _ dashed _ ) in the inset . although the difference is small , we find that the previous method of @xcite tends to overestimate the detection efficiency",
    ".    while it is comforting that the magnitude of this effect is small , its sign is somewhat unsettling . recall that one motivation for integrating over @xmath3 rather than minimizing with respect to @xmath3 was that under the latter procedure , the trajectory could `` avoid '' planetary caustics and underestimate the sensitivity . in the present case , however , this effect is outweighed by the fact that the most probable value of @xmath3 is increased by taking into account the monte carlo compared to the fit to the lightcurve alone .",
    "see figure 5 . as discussed in   1 , sensitivity to planets generally decreases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "note that in this particular case , it is only necessary to integrate over @xmath3 ( and not all lightcurve parameters as originally envisaged by @xcite ) because once @xmath3 is specified , all the other lightcurve parameters are highly constrained ( see   [ sec : relik ] )",
    ".    one might be concerned about finite - source effects during a planet - caustic crossing .",
    "however , we have repeated the calculation including finite - source effects for a variety of ( @xmath146 ) combinations and for various plausible source sizes as determined from monte carlo .",
    "we find no significant difference in planet detection efficiencies .",
    "microlensing events provide only degenerate information on physical properties of the source and lens except in so far as other higher order effects such as finite - source effects and parallax are detected .",
    "however , our new method based on monte carlo simulations allows us , for the first time , to break the degeneracy and place constraints on planetary companions in the planet - mass / physical - separation plane , rather than scaling these quantities to the stellar mass and einstein radius as was done previously .    for a given ensemble of monte carlo events with posterior probabilities @xmath147",
    ", the detection efficiency @xmath148 can be evaluated as a function of the planet mass @xmath149 and the planet - star projected physical separation @xmath150 by , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the number of monte carlo events and @xmath153 is the angular einstein radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : star ] shows the resulting detection efficiency with the curves representing contours for @xmath15425% , 50% , 75% , and 95% .",
    "the left and middle panels show separate detection efficiencies for the ms+bds , and the remnant stars , respectively .",
    "the total efficiency is shown in the right panel . since remnant stars are more massive than ms+bds , at fixed planet - star mass ratio , microlensing events by remnant stars probe planets of higher absolute mass . hence",
    ", microlensing is less efficient as a probe of planets of remnants than of ms+bds at fixed planetary mass .",
    "because our galactic model favors substantially lower blending than is implied by the lightcurve alone , the best fit magnitude is reduced from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "nevertheless , ogle-2003-blg-423 is the highest magnification single - lens event recorded to date . despite this honor ,",
    "the detection efficiency is not quite as good as two previous high magnification events , macho-98-blg-35 ( @xmath157 ) and ogle-1999-bul-35 ( @xmath158 ) ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is because our observations do not cover the peak of the lightcurve nearly as densely as was the case in those two events .",
    "peak coverage is key because the perturbations by planets mostly occur during a small time interval , basically the full width at half maximum around the peak of the event @xcite .",
