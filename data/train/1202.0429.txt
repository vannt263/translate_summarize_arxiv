    "the proximity of ngc1068 ( d=14.4mpc , corresponding to a spatial scale on 1@xmath4pc , @xcite ) as well as its seyfert 2 activity turn this galaxy into the best target to study the chemical composition of molecular clouds in the vicinity of an agn .",
    "the molecular material close to the central engines of agn is thought to be heavily pervaded by x - ray radiation originating in the nuclear accretion disk @xcite .",
    "this strong radiation field has been claimed to be responsible for the observed abundance ratios of some species , such as hco@xmath2/hcn , or hnco / cs , which appear to be clearly different between agn and starburst environments @xcite .",
    "observations of ngc1068 in a number of other molecules , such as sio , hoc@xmath2 , and cn , have revealed a peculiar chemistry interpreted as the result of a giant x - ray dominated region ( xdr ) in its nucleus , where shocks could be also playing a role @xcite .",
    "however , an overall chemical study of ngc1068 has not been done so far due to a lack of unbiased observations of a large number of molecules .",
    "here we present a molecular inventory of this archetypal agn , which is similar to those already obtained for the starburst galaxies ngc253 @xcite and m82 @xcite .",
    "co map of the central region of ngc1068 taken from @xcite .",
    "the beam sizes at the lowest and highest frequencies of the survey are plotted with a solid and dotted circles respectively .",
    "the starburst ring and circumnuclear disk are indicated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the observations were carried out with the iram-30 m telescope ( pico veleta observatory , spain ) between october 2009 and july 2010 .",
    "we observed the circumnuclear disk of ngc1068 at a nominal position @xmath502:42:40.9 , @xmath6=-00:00:46.0 .",
    "the frequencies range observed is between 86.2ghz and 115.6ghz .",
    "we used the band e0 of the emir receiver and the wilma autocorrelator .",
    "this receiver - backend configuration allowed us to cover 8ghz simultaneously in the vertical and horizontal polarizations , and led to a channel width spacing of @xmath7kms@xmath8 .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard dual load method .",
    "the observations were done wobbling the secondary mirror with a switching frequency of 0.5hz and a beam throw of @xmath9220@xmath10 in azimuth .",
    "we checked the pointing accuracy every hour towards the nearby bright continuum sources 2251 + 158 and 0113 - 118 .",
    "the pointing corrections were always better than 4@xmath10 .",
    "the focus was also checked at the beginning of each run and during sunsets .",
    "the rejection of the image sideband was better than 10db along the band .",
    "the beam sizes ranged from 21@xmath10 to 29@xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the observations at the lowest frequencies could have picked up some emission from the starburst ring , while the highest frequencies only detected the cnd emission ( see fig .",
    "[ 12comap ] ) .",
    "we assume that , in the worse case scenario , the starburst ring contribution is lower than 30% @xcite .",
    "the observed spectra were converted from antenna temperatures ( @xmath11 ) to main beam temperatures ( @xmath12 ) using the relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the forward efficiency of the telescope , which values were between 0.94 and 0.95 , and @xmath15 is the main beam efficiency , ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 .",
    "linear baselines were subtracted in all cases .",
    "the rms achieved is @xmath16mk across the whole survey .",
    "the data were also corrected by the beam dilution effect as @xmath17\\,t_{\\rm mb}$ ] , where @xmath18 is the source averaged brightness temperature , @xmath19 is the source size and @xmath20 is the beam size . based on ngc1068 interferometric observations of @xmath21co , hcn , and @xmath3co @xcite , we assumed an average source size of @xmath22 for all the molecular species .",
    "we detected a total of 35 spectral features towards the agn of ngc1068 .",
    "there are no new extragalactic molecular detections .",
    "however , seven species or isotopologues are detected for the first time in this galaxy , namely hc@xmath0n , so , n@xmath1h@xmath2 , ch@xmath0cn , ns , @xmath3cn , and hn@xmath3c . the line identification largely follows the method explained in @xcite .",
    "we fitted gaussian profiles to all the detected species .",
    "the resulting gaussian parameters , as well as figures showing the data , and more specific comments about each molecule , will be presented in aladro et al in preparation .",
    "assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and optically thin emission , we used rotation diagrams to determine the column densities ( @xmath23 ) of the detected species @xcite .",
    "however , some molecules , such as co , hcn or hco@xmath2 , seem to be moderately optically thick in ngc1068 , as will be discussed in aladro et al . in preparation .",
    "therefore , their column densities are likely to be higher . on the other hand",
    ", in those cases where we detected only one transition of a given molecule , we assumed a rotational temperature ( @xmath24 ) of @xmath25k .",
    "the @xmath24 value might have an important impact in the column density determination only in extreme cases , such as @xmath26k or @xmath27k .",
    "table  [ tablent ] lists the @xmath23 obtained for each molecule , as well as the @xmath28 upper limits to the column densities of some other undetected molecules in ngc1068 .",
    "we found that the co species and their carbon and oxygen isotopologues , @xmath3co and c@xmath29o , are the most abundant molecules . on the contrary , hoc@xmath2 is the less abundant of the detected species in our survey .",
    "we took from the literature some molecular transitions that lie outside our 3 mm frequency range ( see table  [ tablent ] for references ) .",
    "few molecules show two different components in the boltzmann diagrams .",
    "this is the case of @xmath21co , @xmath3co and cs .",
    "one of such components belongs to a colder gas with higher column densities , while the other one shows warmer rotational temperatures and lower column densities .",
    "this latter gas component is likely to arise from the inner regions of the molecular clouds .",
    ".column densities of the observed molecules , and @xmath28 upper limits to the column densities of some undetected species in our survey . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ticks show whether each molecules trace pdrs / crdrs , dense gas , or both .",
    "boldface ticks indicate when the abundances given by the models match the observed abundances within one order of magnitude .",
    "we aimed to compare the molecular abundances of ngc1068 with those of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253 .",
    "these are the three extragalactic objects whose chemical compositions are better known so far . ngc253 and",
    "m82 were also targets of unbiased molecular line surveys in the mm range , with 25 and 18 molecular species detected in their respective nuclear regions @xcite .",
    "the starburst in the center of m82 is old , with an average stellar population age of @xmath30myr @xcite .",
    "the nuclear starburst , together with a high supernova rate , create strong uv fields , and thus pdrs dominate the nucleus of m82 . on the other hand",
    ", ngc253 is claimed to be in an early stage of the starburst evolution @xcite , with younger stellar populations in its nucleus ( @xmath31myr @xcite ) where the pdrs , although present , do not drive the heating of molecular clouds .",
    "instead , the nucleus of ngc253 is dominated by large - scale shocks between molecular complexes",
    ". a detailed comparison of the m82 and ngc253 chemistries done by @xcite showed that the ism in both galaxies have different composition , and that molecular abundances can be used to distinguish the physical processes that dominate galaxy nuclei .",
    "figure  [ abundances ] shows the molecular abundances in the central regions of m82 , ngc253 , and ngc1068 .",
    "the molecular ratios were calculated with respect to c@xmath32s because , apart from being optically thinner than the main sulfur isotopologue , it does not seem to be significantly affected by the type of nuclear activity in galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , c@xmath32s has similar column densities in the three galaxies ( few times @xmath33@xmath34 , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that while m82 and ngc253 are located at approximately the same distance , @xmath35mpc @xcite , ngc1068 lies nearly five times further , at 14.4mpc @xcite . while the comparison of the column densities in these galaxies would be biased by the distance",
    ", this should not affect the comparison of the fractional abundances .",
    "on the other hand , because of the different distances the iram-30 m beam covered the @xmath36 central kiloparsecs of the agn , while for the starburst galaxies , the beam covered the inner 360pc .    among all the species compared ,",
    "only h@xmath3cn and h@xmath3co@xmath2 show higher abundances with respect to c@xmath32s in ngc1068 than m82 and ngc253 . on the other hand , c@xmath1h , ch@xmath0oh , hc@xmath0n , hco , and",
    "so show similar abundances in all three galaxies ( within a factor three ) .",
    "a third group is composed by those molecules that are clearly more abundant in m82 and ngc253 than in ngc1068 . from this group",
    "it can be drawn the clearest chemical differentiation between starbursts and agn activities . among the molecules detected in the three galaxies ,",
    "cs / c@xmath32s is almost 5 times higher in ngc253 than in ngc1068 .",
    "similarly , ch@xmath0cn",
    "/ c@xmath32s shows a difference of a factor 3 between ngc253 and ngc1068 , while hoc@xmath2/c@xmath32s is a factor 4 more abundant in m82 than in ngc1068 .",
    "it is remarkable that these three molecular ratios are very similar in m82 and ngc253 ( see fig .  [ abundances ] ) .",
    "moreover , some of the biggest chemical differences are given by those molecules that were clearly detected in both starburst galaxies , but not in ngc1068 , such as ch@xmath0cch , h@xmath1co , h@xmath1cs , so@xmath1 and nh@xmath1cn . among them , ch@xmath0cch",
    "/ c@xmath32s is the ratio showing the highest contrast , being @xmath37 times higher in m82 than in ngc1068 and @xmath38 times higher in ngc253 than in ngc1068 .",
    "therefore , we computed other fractional abundances of ch@xmath0cch with respect to the molecules having similar abundances in the three galaxies .",
    "we found that the most striking differences among the agn and the starburst galaxies are given by r@xmath39 and r@xmath40 .",
    "ch@xmath0cch and hc@xmath0n are claimed to be tracers of dense gas in galaxies @xcite , while c@xmath1h might be tracing both pdrs and dense gas regions @xcite . to avoid comparisons of molecules that might be arising from different regions , we select [ ch@xmath0cch / hc@xmath0n ] as the best ratio to chemically differentiate between agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "we found that r@xmath41 when comparing m82 with ngc1068 , and r@xmath42 when comparing ngc253 with ngc1068 .",
    "we note that a factor of , at least , 64 is much larger than the r@xmath43 commonly used to differentiate between agn and starburst environments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our upper limit to the column density of ch@xmath0cch in ngc1068 is not very tight , so the molecular ratios could be even larger .",
    "the values found for r@xmath44 indicate that the dense ism in the ngc1068 nucleus resembles more ngc253 than m82 .",
    "this points at the existence of shocks ( rather than pdrs ) accompanying the strong x - ray fields present in the central regions of ngc1068 .",
    "we carried out a molecular line survey with the iram 30-m telescope towards the active galactic nucleus of ngc1068 .",
    "we covered the frequencies between 86.2ghz and 115.6ghz , detecting a total of 35 spectral line features .",
    "seven species , or their carbon isotopologues , are detected for the first time in this galaxy , namely hc@xmath0n , so , n@xmath1h@xmath2 , ch@xmath0cn , ns , @xmath3cn , and hn@xmath3c .",
    "some molecules , such as ch@xmath0cch , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 , ocs , so@xmath1 , ns , hoco@xmath2 , and nh@xmath1cn , are not detected in ngc1068 .",
    "we compared the molecular abundances of the ngc1068 nucleus ( claimed to be a giant xdr , e.g. @xcite ) , with those of m,82 ( claimed to be a giant pdr , @xcite ) , and ngc253 ( claimed to be dominated by low - velocity shocks , @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the ratio r@xmath39 shows the largest differences among the three galaxies .",
    "specifically , r@xmath39 is at least 64 times larger in m82 than in ngc1068 , and at least 4 times larger in ngc253 than in ngc1068 .",
    "therefore , this ratio can be used to disentangle between agn and starburst physical environments .",
    "furthermore , r@xmath39 indicates that uv fields are not probably strong enough in the inner 2kpc of ngc1068 .",
    "instead , shocks , could be playing a secondary role , after x - rays .",
    "we used the time - dependent chemical ( ucl_chem ) and pdr ( ucl_pdr ) models to simulate the chemistry in molecular clouds under several physical conditions that might co - exist in agn .",
    "we note , however , that our aim was not to simulate the particular environment in the center of ngc1068 , but to study the influence of uv and cosmic ray fields in the abundances of a large number of molecules .",
    "we found that some species seem to always trace photon - dominated regions and/or cosmic ray - dominated regions independently of the strength of the uv and cosmic ray fields ( such as c@xmath1h and cn ) , while other species always trace dense gas regions ( e.g. ch@xmath0oh , cs , so , hnco , and sio ) .",
    "finally , some molecules might be arising from the inner and/or outer layers of the molecular clouds depending on the strength of the external radiation fields ( examples are hco@xmath2 , hnc and n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) ."
