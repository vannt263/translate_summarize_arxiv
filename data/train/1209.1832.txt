    "in @xcite @xcite asked himself _ how large must a universe be in order that it shall contain light emitted within it ? _",
    "if we change the wording _ how large _ by _ how strong the gravity field must be _ and the word _",
    "universe _ by the word _ object _ , then we have the history of _ black holes _ as follows : first known consideration of light not being able to escape from such an object ( not a universe ) was given by @xcite in @xcite .",
    "eleven years later @xcite addressed the same question .",
    "after the publication of einstein s general relativity @xcite published in @xcite a solution to general relativity advancing his well known radius ( later referred as the gravitational radius of a mass @xmath0 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "about 50 years later it was recognized that black holes were predicted by general relativity .",
    "was @xcite the known author of the name _ black hole _ in @xcite , referring to the _ continuous gravitational collapse _ of an over - compact mass .",
    "it is evident that the first author to treat our universe as a black hole , five years before this name was used , was @xcite .",
    "it is not necessary to think of a black hole as an over - compact mass .",
    "one can have a black hole with any mass , as long as it also has the right size .",
    "the biggest mass that one can consider is the mass of the _ seeable _ universe : a universe that contains all light emitted within it .",
    "usually the word _ visible",
    "_ universe refers to the visible light from the surface of last scattering , from the recombination epoch ( like the cmbr ) .",
    "observable _ universe refers to the universe we could observe with light or some other means from the initial big - bang . as we will see , here the word _ seeable",
    "_ refers to the universe considered as a black hole , like the surface of the event horizon , as noted by @xcite .",
    "now , an average density of the observable universe is of the order of @xmath13 , about the critical density .",
    "the age of the universe t is now believed to be about @xmath14 ( @xcite @xcite ) . then multiplying this by the speed of light we get the number @xmath15 .",
    "if we look deep in space we are looking back in time , much more back the deeper we look .",
    "we are limited in going back in time by the amount of @xmath14 , as we will see .",
    "we are then limited to see deeper than about @xmath16 .",
    "we may roughly calculate a mass for the observable universe by computing the mass from the density inside a sphere of size @xmath15 .",
    "this gives a mass of about @xmath17 using the general relativity coefficient for volume @xmath18 .",
    "using this value for the mass one gets the value of the gravitational radius of the universe as    @xmath19    we have called this gravitational radius as the radius of the sphere of the _ seeable _ universe .",
    "it has a deep physical meaning .",
    "this wording comes from the calculation of the size of a universe that has all its light trapped , as we will see ( identified here with the gravitational radius @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is then a maximum that can not be observed in the sense that any light getting close to this limit just turns around and goes back to its origin .",
    "it is like being able to see your own back looking deep in space .",
    "but the observational size of the universe is less than that today . when calculating it as the hubble radius , @xmath20 , a conventional way to define an observational universe ,",
    "it is smaller than the _ seeable _",
    "size @xmath7 .",
    "we will prove that the radius of the seeable universe increases with time as @xmath21 , while the size of observable universe increases as ct ( today about @xmath16 ) . taking the speed of light as constant",
    "this means a linear relation with time .",
    "the speed of expansion for the gravitational radius is @xmath22 and its acceleration is therefore constant , an accelerated universe as has been observed for the last ten years type ia supernova , @xcite ; and cmb anisotropies , @xcite. clearly the gravitational radius is larger than the observable radius ( about a factor of @xmath23 today ) and its expansion going faster drags the far away galaxies out of sight . looking and identifying a far away galaxy , and looking again after some time long enough",
    ", no galaxy would be there : it just disappears .",
    "this is a proposed test that may be technically possible in the near future . with the expansion due to the dark energy background of the universe going as @xmath24",
    ", it may be that this happens earlier than thought ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite @xcite found an upper bound for the ratio of the entropy @xmath25 to the energy @xmath26 of any bounded system with effective size @xmath27 : @xmath28    about ten years later ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) a holographic principle was proposed giving a bound for the entropy @xmath29 of a bounded system of effective size @xmath27 as    @xmath30    if the two bounds turn out to be identical @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath27 and the system strictly obeys the schwarzschild condition for a black hole .",
    "also , for the case of a black hole we find that the hawking and unruh temperatures are the same .",
    "identifying the bounds of equations ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) @xmath31 simplifying and using @xmath32 , we get @xmath33 this is the condition for the system @xmath34 to be a black hole .",
    "then , its entropy is given by the @xcite relation    @xmath35    that coincides with the two bounds of equations ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "the mass of the universe @xmath36 is a maximum . and",
    "so is its size @xmath27 .",
    "a bounded system implies a finite value for both . using present values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 they very closely fulfill the schwarzschild condition ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "this has been taken as an evidence for the universe to be considered as a black hole ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that a black hole has a temperature , and therefore entropy ( established by @xcite @xcite ) , implies that an observer at its surface , or event horizon , sees a perfect blackbody radiation , a thermal radiation with temperature @xmath39 given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the planck s constant , @xmath5 the speed of light , @xmath3 the gravitational constant , @xmath42 boltzmann s constant and @xmath0 the mass of the black hole .",
    "this observer feels a surface gravitational acceleration @xmath43 . according to the @xcite effect",
    "an accelerated observer also sees a thermal radiation at a temperature @xmath44 , proportional to the acceleration @xmath43 and given by    @xmath45    based upon the similarity between the mechanical and thermo dynamical properties of both effects , equations ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) , we identify both temperatures and find the relation :    @xmath46    identifying the unruh acceleration to the surface gravitational acceleration :    @xmath47    and substituting in equation ( [ e8 ] ) we finally get @xmath48    this is the condition for a black hole .",
    "since the hawking temperature refers to a black hole this result confirms the validity of the identification of the two temperatures , equations ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) , as well as the interpretation of the unruh acceleration in equation ( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "from the equivalence principle , one gets the strength of the gravitational effect of a mass @xmath0 on the metric at position @xmath4 from it ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "it is proportional to the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 , which normally is @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the gravitational constant , @xmath0 the mass of the gravitating body , @xmath4 the position of the metric from the gravitating body and @xmath5 the speed of light .",
    "seeable _ universe is the sphere , with center at the observer , having a size such that it shall contain all light emitted within it . for this to occur",
    ", one can impose that the gravitational effect on the velocity of light at @xmath4 give a zero value for the radial component , and non zero for the tangential one ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "then , light is always inside the seeable universe , trapped within it .",
    "the condition is given by the equality @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the radius of the _ seeable _ universe .",
    "it is the gravitational radius of the mass @xmath0 .",
    "we will prove in the next section that the cosmological equation of state @xmath49 , with the present observed value of @xmath50 , implies that the gravitational radius @xmath7 varies as @xmath51 .",
    "the einstein tensor @xmath52 has a 4d zero divergence by construction : @xmath53    the tensor @xmath52 is a geometrical object and is the left hand side of the field equations .",
    "then , the covariant divergence of the second term , i. e. , @xmath54 , @xmath55 the energy - momentum tensor , must be zero .",
    "the resultant equation has been found under the full generalization of considering @xmath3 , @xmath5 and the cosmological @xmath56 as time variables ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we repeat it here :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is here energy density , @xmath59 the hubble parameter @xmath60 , @xmath61 the cosmological scale factor as is defined in the robertson - walker metric , and @xmath62 defines the equation of state . considering the cosmological constant @xmath56 as a true constant",
    "one can integrate equation ( [ e12 ] ) giving ,    @xmath63    using the conversion @xmath64 $ ] , since @xmath65 is mass density , i.e. @xmath66 , the result ( [ e13 ] ) is transformed to    @xmath67    and using the definition of the gravitational radius @xmath7 as the schwarzschild radius we get from equation ( [ e14 ] ) @xmath68    hence , the gravitational radius , the _",
    "seeable _ size of the universe as a black hole , depends only on the cosmological scale factor @xmath61 and the equation of state parameter @xmath62 . with the present value for the parameter @xmath69 we have the solution from equation ( [ e15 ] ) as    @xmath70    we use now the friedmann equation that , together with equation ( [ e15 ] )",
    ", completely defines the cosmological model ( the integration of the two einstein cosmological equations ) :    @xmath71 ^ 2 = 8 \\pi g \\rho / 3 = g m / [ a(t)]^3 \\times \\hbox{constant } \\label{e17}\\ ] ]    whatever the time dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath0 may be , we prove now that their product @xmath72 must be a constant .",
    "this comes from the consideration that the entropies in equations ( [ e2 ] ) , ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) must be an extensive property , proportional to mass @xmath0 .",
    "we know that @xmath3 is always associated with a mass .",
    "then the constancy of mass can be substituted by the constancy of @xmath72 . the friedman equation ( [ e17 ] )",
    "is then ,    @xmath73^{2 } = \\hbox{constant } \\label{e18}\\ ] ]    which is the well known einstein - de sitter model with solution : @xmath74 = ( t / t_0)^{2/3 } \\label{e19}\\ ] ]    recently ( @xcite @xcite ) it has been shown that the probability that the universe emerges right after a _ big trip _ , thus avoiding a _ big rip _ , in a state of initial constant @xmath75 , will be maximal if and only if one has @xmath76 . from equation ( [ e15 ] ) we see that this value corresponds to a gravitational radius for the universe expanding as the cosmological factor @xmath61 given in equation ( [ e18 ] ) , an initial einstein - de sitter state of the universe expanding as in equation ( [ e19 ] ) . after this",
    "we have today strong evidence that the value of @xmath62 is @xmath77 , at least as far back as redshift @xmath78 . again , going to equation ( [ e15 ] ) we see that the gravitational radius of the universe expands now as ,    @xmath79^{-3 \\omega } = [ a(t ) / a(t_0)]^{3 } = ( t / t_0)^2 \\label{e20}\\ ] ]    then , the gravitational radius of the universe starts with a time dependence as given by the einstein - de sitter universe , equation ( [ e19 ] ) with the equation of state @xmath80 and evolves in such a way that the dark matter and energy components make the equation very close to @xmath9 as of today .",
    "the observable size of the universe going as @xmath11 implies that all contents in the universe are dragged faster than this , @xmath51 as in equation ( [ e20 ] ) .",
    "in our approach galaxies are physically dragged by expansion as @xmath51 which means that they are disappearing when they are dragged beyond the distance @xmath81 . by looking at a particular identifiable galaxy deep in space",
    ", we could check its disappearance after some finite time .",
    "this implies a repetition of observations of the same galaxy deep in space hoping to find at some later time that the pinpointed galaxy is no longer there .",
    "figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] present this situation .",
    "@xcite presented in @xcite arguments to expect objects to become out of causal contact . later",
    "@xcite , as well as @xcite , pointed out this possibility about ten years ago . in this direction an out of sight possibility for far away galaxies has been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the calculations made , as @xcite presented , must be halved in our case due to the @xmath51 dependence of the dragging background presented here .",
    "we also present it under a different point of view , with the same basic idea of getting out of sight galaxies in time due to accelerated expansion .",
    "our conclusion on the dragging effect going as @xmath51 halves the calculations presented by these authors .",
    "position of galaxy a at @xmath82 in the observable universe.,width=8,height=8 ]    position of galaxy a at @xmath83 out of the observable universe.,width=8,height=8 ]",
    "the universe can be seen as a black hole . from each observer in it",
    "we can interpret that he is at the centre of a sphere , with the hubble radius , that would be the observable universe , but there is the gravitational radius that is larger than the observable one .",
    "the isotropic acceleration present at each point in the universe , and given by equation ( [ e9 ] ) , implies that there is no distortion for the spherically distributed acceleration if we consider the strict conditions of the cosmological principle .",
    "however , the presence of a nearby important mass , like the sun , in any point in interplanetary space will distort this spherically symmetric picture .",
    "with respect to the probes pioneer 10/11 , that detected an anomalous extra acceleration towards the sun of value @xmath84 ( @xcite @xcite ) , we can see that this value is only a bit higher than the one predicted by equation ( [ e9 ] ) , which is about @xmath85 .",
    "this difference is an effect that can be explained by the presence of the sun converting the isotropic acceleration to an anisotropic one .",
    "for about ten years we have good evidence that the universe is expanding in an accelerated way .",
    "we have found here that the present observations , that favours the value @xmath69 for the equation of state , imply an expanding law of the type @xmath21 giving a constant acceleration .",
    "thus , the gravitational radius rg , that can be interpreted as the size of the universe as a black hole , trapping all light gives the maximum _ seeable _",
    "size for the universe .",
    "the hubble radius , @xmath20 , can be interpreted as the maximum observable size for the universe since it is limited by its age , the distance travelled by light going backwards in time up to the initial stages .",
    "the background _",
    "is then expanding at a faster rate than it can be observed .",
    "and this _ vacuum _ is the frame for all cosmological structures , like the galaxies .",
    "then , galaxies are physically dragged by expansion as @xmath51 which means that they are disappearing when they are dragged beyond the distance @xmath20 . by looking at a particular identifiable galaxy very deep in space",
    ", we could check its disappearance after some finite time .",
    "the past calculations for this to occur are here halved by the expansion law @xmath86 .",
