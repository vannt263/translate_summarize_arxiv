    "the interpretation of hadronic resonances is an important subject of low - energy hadron physics . can all resonances be described in terms of the building blocks of qcd , quarks and gluons ?",
    "are there , on the contrary , ` dynamically generated ' resonances , which emerge as molecular bound states upon interactions of other , more fundamental hadrons ?    in this work we shall concentrate on some particular mesons in the mass range 1 - 1.5 gev : @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath3 these states were investigated both in the old - fashioned quark model @xcite and in more recent studies @xcite . in the quark model they are interpreted as quark - antiquark pairs : @xmath4 with quantum numbers @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 with quantum numbers @xmath8 ( similarly for the other charged states ) , @xmath9 with quantum numbers @xmath10 indeed , the quarkonium assignment describes very well the masses and also the decays properties for the whole tensor meson nonet @xmath11 @xcite , to which @xmath12 belongs .",
    "it also functions well for the axial - vector meson nonet @xmath13 to which @xmath1 belongs .",
    "the scalar mesons , such as @xmath14 are as usual controversial objects in qcd , however the interpretation of @xmath2 as predominantly quarkonium is in agreement with the present results , see refs . @xcite and refs . therein for the presentation of various mixing patterns .    in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite the very same resonances @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been obtained in -at first sight- utterly different light : the resonances @xmath12 and @xmath2 are interpreted as @xmath15 molecular states , and @xmath1 is interpreted as @xmath16 molecular state .",
    "these works are based on the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation applied to mesonic low - energy chiral lagrangians describing @xmath17 and @xmath16 interactions .",
    "the two descriptions seem mutually exclusive : a mesonic molecular state is a different object than a quark - antiquark bound state .",
    "this is surely true , but a closer look at the problem is necessary .",
    "namely , to which extent can one conclude that these resonances are hadronic molecular states ?",
    "surely , the bs equation represents a well - defined field theoretical framework to describe bound states .",
    "however , the bs approach is used in the context of low - energy hadronic theories as a unitarization method : the bs - resummation scheme is applied to a low - energy effective lagrangians with a limited range of validity .",
    "the masses of the poles of bs amplitudes lie above the validity of the corresponding low - energy hadronic theory .",
    "this is indeed a subtle point that requires a careful study , which we will present in this paper along the line of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is useful to discuss the problem with the help of two examples :    \\(a ) positronium states in qed : the qed lagrangian contains two fields , the photon and the electron .",
    "further composite states with a mass of about @xmath18 emerge upon electron - positron interactions .",
    "these states are the positronia , i.e. bound states of electron and positron due to photon exchange .",
    "positronia are genuine dynamically generated states of molecular type which do not appear in the original qed lagrangian .",
    "\\(b ) fermi - lagrangian and the nature of the @xmath19 meson : in the standard model ( sm ) the fields @xmath20 electron and neutrino are elementary .",
    "the mass of the weak @xmath19 boson is however very large ( 80 gev ) .",
    "when integrating out from the sm the @xmath19-field , the fermi lagrangian for @xmath21-@xmath22 interaction emerges .",
    "if one applies unitarization techniques by resumming @xmath21-@xmath22 loops to the fermi lagrangian , the existence of the @xmath19 meson can be inferred .",
    "however , this does not mean that the @xmath19 meson is a ` dynamically generated ' bound state of an electron and a neutrino .",
    "indeed , the @xmath19 meson is exactly as elementary as @xmath21 and @xmath23 one can rather say that the @xmath19 meson can be ` reconstructed ' by unitarizing the low - energy fermi lagrangian .",
    "the question concerning the resonances @xmath0 @xmath24 and @xmath2 can be summarized as follows : are they analogous to the case ( a ) or the case ( b ) ? in this work",
    "we argue that they are analogous to the case ( b ) .",
    "this means that these resonances are not hadronic molecular bound states , but rather standard quarkonia .",
    "they are obtained upon unitarizations of low - energy hadronic lagrangians , just as the @xmath19 meson can be obtained from the low - energy fermi lagrangian .",
    "the qcd lagrangian @xmath25 contains quarks and gluons , which due to confinement are not the relevant degrees of freedom at low energy .",
    "the proper degrees of freedom are colorless hadron states .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing these hadrons up to ( some ) maximal energy @xmath26 is denoted as @xmath27    we briefly describe four important particular cases of @xmath28    \\(i ) the case @xmath29 gev is interesting from a phenomenological point of view , because all the low - lying nonets ( ( pseudo)scalars and ( axial)vectors ) lie below this energy .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath30 is unknown .",
    "it is in fact not possible to derive it from @xmath31 ( for recent attempts to describe -part of- @xmath32 gev@xmath33 including ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial)vector mesons see ref .",

    "this is indeed the lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory @xcite , whose terms , but not the related coupling constants ( known as low - energy coupling constants , lecs ) , can be determined by considerations based on chiral symmetry .",
    "note , if @xmath40 were known it would be possible , upon integrating out all the heavier fields , to determine exactly @xmath41 : both the operators and the lecs would be calculable . in the next subsection a toy model where this operation is possible is shown .",

    "however , it is clear that the @xmath50 state , just as the previously discussed weak @xmath19 boson , is not a dynamically generated molecular state of two @xmath49 fields ! this is clear by the way we constructed our toy - model .",
    "however , if one would not know @xmath57 but only the low - energy lagrangian @xmath59 , one could be led to this incorrect interpretation of the nature of the @xmath50 state .",

    "the quantity @xmath86 is a polynomial of order @xmath74 in @xmath108 and therefore has no pole for any finite value of @xmath109 this implies the incorrect result that @xmath110 for @xmath111    \\(iii ) for @xmath112 it is possible to recast the bs - scheme in such a way that the correct large-@xmath45 result is obtained @xcite .",
    "however , this is not possible for the case @xmath113 which is generally considered for explicit hadronic calculations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the iam unitarization scheme , which is also applicable for @xmath114 is in agreement with the large-@xmath45 results . for a comparative study of different unitarization schemes",

    "it is important to remark that what is here criticized is not the result of the bs - unitarization , which is a valuable and correct analysis , but only the related interpretation of the resonances as hadronic molecular states .",
    "some ` dynamically generated states ' exist for sure : the nuclei .",
    "they are genuine bound state of more fundamental hadrons , the protons and neutrons .",
    "the question discussed in this paper concerns the identification of molecular states beyond nuclei . to this end",

    "our answer is negative . with the help of a toy model",
    "we have shown that the interpretation of these states as standard quark - antiquark mesons is legitimate . in this way",
    "there is no conflict between the prediction of the quark model and the findings of bs unitarizations , which then represent two alternative ways to describe the same quark - antiquark objects .",
    "we believe that the reconciliation of the quark - model with unitarization studies solves the following puzzle : the quark - antiquark interpretation works well in the tensor and axial - vector sectors , to which @xmath12 and @xmath1 belong .",

    "future studies are certainly needed .",
    "the fact that the quarkonium interpretation for @xmath0 @xmath24 and @xmath2 is legitimate , in agreement with present phenomenological information and in a sense also ` desirable ' , does not represent a conclusive proof .",
