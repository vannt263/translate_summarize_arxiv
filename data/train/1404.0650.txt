    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are important cosmological probes that first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the cosmological results rely on the normal sne ia whose brightness correlates with their light curve shapes and colors @xcite , allowing them to be used as standardizable candles .",
    "observations of similar but peculiar objects are useful for understanding the nature of the progenitor systems and the physics of the explosion , particularly how they might differ between objects .",
    "it is also important to understand objects which may be found in cosmological samples but do not follow the relationships between the luminosity and the light curve shape .",
    "the similar peak luminosities of sne ia suggested explosions of similar mass and energy .",
    "the widely - held theory is that a sn ia results from the thermonuclear disruption of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( co - wd ) as it approaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "this could be due to accretion from a non - degenerate companion ( also called the single degenerate scenario ; @xcite ) or the disruption of a wd companion ( also called the double degenerate scenario ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of an sn ia progenitor as a c - o wd ( and admittedly for a single case ) has only recently been confirmed by very early time observations of sn  2011fe @xcite .",
    "the wd mass at explosion might not need approach the chandrasekhar limit , as helium shell detonations can trigger a core detonation in sub - chandrasekhar mass progenitors @xcite .",
    "the nature of the companion remains unknown , and recent results suggest that sne ia may result from both single degenerate and double degnerate systems .",
    "early observations of many sne ia do not show the interaction expected @xcite if the sn explosion were to interact with a red giant ( rg ) companion @xcite .",
    "x - ray limits also rule out red giants due to the lack of shock interaction @xcite .",
    "pre - explosion , multi - wavelength , and extremely early observations of sn  2011fe rule out a rg @xcite and even a main sequence ( ms ) companion @xcite for that object .",
    "searches for the leftover companion in snr 0509 - 67.5 rule out a non - degenerate companion @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of nearby sne has found a preference for blue shifted sodium absorption in about 20 - 25% of sne ia @xcite and even variable absorption @xcite suggestive of a local csm wind from a non - degenerate companion .",
    "ptf11kx observations showed signatures of a recurrent nova progenitor in a single degenerate system @xcite .",
    "thus , multiple channels might be required to create the explosions classified as sne ia .",
    "the idea that the accreting progenitor explodes as it approaches the chandrasekhar mass has been challenged by a class of sne that appear spectroscopically similar to sne ia but are overluminous for their light curve shape .",
    "detailed modeling of the light curves appears to require more than a chandrasekhar mass of ejected material .",
    "sn  2003fg was the first discovered @xcite with sne 2006gz @xcite , 2007if @xcite and 2009dc @xcite showing similarities .",
    "@xcite discovered five additional , similar objects in sn factory observations , though only one was conclusively above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "association with this subclass is sometimes based on spectroscopic similarity to others of the class , to a high inferred luminosity , or to actually modeling the light curve and determining a high ejecta mass .",
    "variations exist amongst candidates of his subclass , which is not surprising given our limited understanding of their origin and relationship to normal sne ia .",
    "@xcite highlight the observational differences between sne 2003fg and 2006gz , two probable super - chandarasekhar mass candidates .",
    "the most common means of estimating the mass from sne ia comes from the application of `` arnett s law '' @xcite . at maximum light",
    "the luminosity output is approximately equal to the instantaneous rate of energy release from radioactive decay .",
    "thus the peak bolometric luminosity is proportional to the mass of @xmath0ni synthesized in the explosion .",
    "the @xmath0ni can also be estimated from the late light curve @xcite or nebular spectra @xcite .",
    "the total mass can be estimated based on energetics using the observed luminosities and expansion velocities and assumptions on the density profile ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mass can also be estimated by constructing models of various masses and explosion scenarios and comparing to the observed light curves @xcite and spectra @xcite .",
    "not all of the luminosity necessarily comes from radioactive decay .",
    "excess luminosity could also come from circumstellar interaction @xcite or result from asymmetric explosions viewed at a favorable angle @xcite .",
    "asymmetric explosions can not explain the brightest of sc sne , and spectropolarimetry of sn  2009dc implies no large scale asymmetries in the plane of the sky @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find that the late time observations of sn  2006gz require less radioactive ni than suggested from peak optical observations , drawing into question the overluminous nature of the event .",
    "they suggest that the luminosity is overestimated due to an over - correction for extinction .",
    "sc sne are hot , high - energy explosions , so ultraviolet ( uv ) coverage is important to better measure the total luminosity and determine its origin , in particular whether it originates from shocks or simply a hot photosphere . the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) on the swift satellite @xcite presents an excellent opportunity to obtain unique , early - time uv data .",
    "this paper will focus on three objects : sn  2009dc  a well - studied member of the super - chandrasekhar mass sn class  and sne 2011aa and 2012dn which share some characteristics .",
    "we will refer to these candidate super - chandrasekhar sne ia as sc sne below , though a firm mass determination will require more data and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "comparisons will focus on the differences and similarities between sn  2009dc and the less studied sne 2011aa and 2012dn , and the differences of these three sc sne compared to other sne ia . in section [ obs ]",
    "we discuss these three sc sne and present uv / optical photometry and spectra from uvot . in section [ results ]",
    "we compare the colors , absolute magnitudes , spectra , and integrated luminosities , comparing sne 2011aa and 2012dn to 2009dc and the three to a larger sample of `` normal '' sne ia . in section [ discussion ]",

    "the photometry for sn  2011aa also includes galaxy subtraction , so the late time flattening in the uv filters appears to be real .",
    "sn  2012dn does not have galaxy template images , but the amount of galaxy contamination is likely small . the uvot b and v bands are similar to johnson @xmath4 and @xmath5 while the swift u - band is extends to much shorter wavelengths than johnson @xmath6 or sloan @xmath7 ( and does not suffer from atmospheric attenuation ) , of particular importance for sne such as these with different uv spectral shapes than normal sne .",

    "sne 2003fg @xcite , 2006gz @xcite , 2007if @xcite , 2009dc @xcite , and 2012dn @xcite all noted cii , often very strong .",

    "similar to the sc sne , 1991t - like and 2002cx - like sne showed a monotonic reddening in uvw1-v from the onset of swift observations . with the exception of sn  2007s ( whose optical colors suggest reddening from the host galaxy ; @xcite ) ,",

    "the 91t - like sn  2007cq was classified by @xcite as a muv - blue , because it follows the nuv - red group in uvw1-v but is relatively blue in uvm2-uvw1 .",
    "thus multi - epoch multi - wavelength uv photometry reveals complicated similarities and differences amongst sne of different subclasses and within the same subclass .",
    "further observations of members of these classes , including uv spectroscopy and even earlier uv photometry , will help explain the physical origins of the uv flux .",
    "since one common characteristic of the strongest sc sn candidates is their high luminosity , we now examine the absolute magnitudes of sne 2009dc , 2011aa , and 2012dn . as in @xcite , most distance moduli are computed from the host galaxy recessional velocity , corrected for local velocity flows @xcite , and a hubble constant of 72 km / s / mpc @xcite .",

    "sn  2009dc lies clearly amongst the other sc sne while sne 2011aa and 2012dn have v - band absolute magnitudes consistent with the other sne ia .",
    "the absolute magnitudes , especially in the uv , are very sensitive to the extinction .",
    "one concern for the analysis of sn  2006gz based on the luminosity is that it is very sensitive to the assumed extinction ",
    "sn  2006gz could be fainter if there is less host extinction or if the extinction coefficient is smaller . in multiple analyses",
    "sn  2009dc is bright even if no host galaxy extinction is assumed but could be even brighter . in this plot",
    "we have assumed no host dust extinction , yet they could be extinguished by dust in the host galaxy , and thus intrinsically brighter .",
    "the extremely blue colors would suggest that the host reddening is minimal , but the intrinsic colors of these objects are not actually known .",
    "a larger sample is needed to determine observationally what the range of colors might be and how blue the unreddened color could be .",
    "the degeneracy between reddening and luminosity means that the sne 2011aa and 2012dn could have low reddening and be optically underluminous compared to sn  2009dc .",
    "alternatively , significant reddening would mean they are intrinsically bluer and even more overluminous in the uv .",
    "either way , these three sne show similarities but are not identical .",
    "figure [ fig_uvotspectra ] shows the uvot grism spectra of sne 2009dc , 2011aa , and 2012dn .",
    "the signal to noise ratio is much lower than usual for optical sn spectroscopy , but comparable to other swift / uvot spectra @xcite .",
    "sn  2011aa was contaminated by an overlapping stellar spectrum , but sne 2009dc and 2012dn exhibit similar continuum shapes and features .",
    "absorption from mgii appears in the nuv , while shortward of that the spectrum is blanketed by overlapping lines of iron - peak elements .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig_uvotspectra ] compares the combined uvot - salt spectrum of sn2012dn to an hst uv / optical spectrum of sn  2011fe taken 2011 september 7 ( 2.9 days before maximum light in the b band ; @xcite ) and a swift / uvot grism spectrum of the broad but normal sn  2009ig @xcite taken 2009",
    "september 3.7 ( 2.3 days before maximum light in the b band ) .",
    "all three spectra have been normalized to the same b - band magnitude to compare the relative flux in the uv .",
    "sn  2011fe , classified as a nuv - blue sn @xcite , and sn  1009ig are not dissimilar to sn  2012dn above 4000  .",
    "the caii h&k lines of sn  2009ig are very broad and deep @xcite , reducing its nuv flux . in the muv ,",
    "sne  2009ig and 2011fe have a much lower flux and a smoother pseudocontinuum .",
    "while we do not want to overinterpret the grism spectrum by studying individual features at this time , the strong undulations in the muv of sne 2009dc and 2012dn suggest a lower opacity ( and thus gaps in the line blanketing ) , rather than a hot blackbody from a shock interaction , as the source of the increased uv luminosity .      to determine how much flux is observed , we need to convert from the observed magnitudes .",
    "flux conversion factors are very spectrum dependent in the uv @xcite , differing by source type and phase for objects ( like sne ) with time - variable spectra .",
    "simpler seds based on the photometry have a problem reproducing the multi - filter photometry . to estimate the flux contributions of different wavelength regions , we use the combined uv / optical spectrum we have for sn  2012dn and warp it to match the photometry as follows .",
    "first , the spectrum was smoothed with a running average over 10  .",
    "the spectrum is extrapolated beyond the uvot filter range using the mean of the spectrum in the shortest 50   ( between 2200 and 2250  ) .",
    "then the whole spectrum was scaled by a constant value to match the observed b - band magnitude at that epoch .",
    "a warping function is created from linear segments from 1500    to 8100    ( just beyond the uvot bounds ) with pivot points near where the uvot filter curves intersect each other ( after normalizing by the integral of the effective area of the curve to deweight the broader filters ) .",
    "these points are at 2030 , 2460 , 3050 , 3870 , and 4960  .",
    "these seven points are iteratively adjusted to minimize the magnitude differences between the observed photometry and that of the warped spectrum .",
    "this method better reproduces the spectral shape than converting the observed photometry to independent flux density points and simply connecting the dots ( brown et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "the sn2012dn spectrum is used for sne 2012dn and 2011aa . for sn  2009dc",
    "we combine the uvot grism spectrum with a comparable epoch spectrum from @xcite obtained from the wiserep database @xcite .    from these warped spectra",
    "we calculate the amount of flux coming from the full uvot range ( 1600 - 6000  ) and three regions  muv ( 1600 - 2800  ) , nuv ( 2800 - 4000  ) , and optical ( 4000 - 6000  ) at each epoch with photometry in all six uvot filters .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig_flux ] shows the integrated flux of the three sc sne compared to a direct integration of the uv / optical spectra of @xcite for the normal nuv - blue sn  2011fe . despite their bright uv luminosity , sne 2011aa and 2012dn which have about the same integrated luminosity as the normal sn  2011fe .",
    "sn  2009dc is about twice as bright .",
    "the evolution of the muv and nuv flux fractions ( compared to the total 1600 - 6000   flux ) are displayed in the middle and lower panel of figure [ fig_flux ] .",
    "the nuv fractions for the sc sne and sn2011fe all peak between 44 and 48% .",
    "sne 2012dn and 2011aa have 10 and 9% , respectively , of their flux in the muv in their earliest observation . by b - band",
    "maximum light , the fraction for sn  2012dn has dropped down to 4% , only modestly above sn  2011fe .",
    "sn  2011aa has a significantly larger fraction of its flux ( compared to the others ) for at least ten days after the b - band maximum . as a simple check on the effect of the template spectrum",
    "we perform the same color matching for all three sne using the sne 2009dc and 2012dn spectra , uv / optical spectra of sn  2011fe from @xcite near maximum light and 24 days after maximum , the near maximum spectrum of the sn ia 1992a from @xcite and a spectrum of vega from @xcite .",
    "the total flux changes by only a few percent and the muv fraction changes by up to 15% ( in a relative sense ) , indicating that the luminosity measurement is dependent on , but not dominated by , the spectral template inputed .",
    "the integrated luminosity curves allow us to compare in a relative sense the bolometric luminosity of sne 2011aa and 2012dn to the well - studied sn  2009dc , and thus the inferred @xmath0ni mass . since the colors of sne 2011aa and 2012dn are similar to or bluer in color than sn 2009dc , we assume for now that they do not suffer significantly more dust extinction than sn  2009dc and that the same fractions of the bolometric luminosities lie outside of our 1600 - 6000   range for all three sne .",
    "we also assume the rise time is similar for the three sne and that the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the radioactive luminosity is the same . under these ( many ) assumptions ,",
    "the mass of @xmath0ni is proportional to the integrated luminosity l@xmath21 . for a range of host galaxy reddening values , @xcite determined a @xmath0ni between 1.2 and 3.7 @xmath22 , with a most likely value of 1.7 @xmath2 0.4 @xmath22 . since sne 2011aa and 2012dn have about half the integrated luminosity",
    ", their @xmath0ni would likely be around 0.9 @xmath22 .",
    "while smaller than sn  2009dc , it is close to the the amount of @xmath0ni produced ( 0.92 @xmath22 ) in a chandrasekhar - mass detonation where the entire mass is converted into iron group elements @xcite .",
    "one could also make the comparison with sn  2011fe .",
    "because of its smaller luminosity and shorter rise time ( 16.58 days for sn  2011fe compared to at least 21.1 days for sn  2009dc ) , the @xmath0ni mass is estimated to be 0.53 @xmath22 @xcite . if sne 2011aa and 2012dn were assumed to have similar rise times and radiative efficiencies as sn  2011fe , the @xmath0ni masses would also be similar .",
    "so the estimate relies in part on assumptions about an unobserved property  the rise time .",
    "the observed properties of sne 2011aa and 2012dn are more similar to sn  2009dc than sn  2011fe , but this highlights the need for a better understanding these objects and limiting the assumptions that must be made .",
    "further analysis is needed to determine more accurately the @xmath0ni mass required and what progenitor / explosion scenarios might result in these observables .",
    "one suggestion for the increased luminosity in sc sne is shock interaction @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest uv observations as a means to probe the influence of shock interactions on the early luminosity .",
    "@xcite performed numerical calculations of the spectra and simulated uvot light curves resulting from a double - degnerate sn ia exploding within a shell of unaccreted material .",
    "while our candidate sc sne ia have peak luminosities comparable to those studied by @xcite , the light curves shapes are much different .",
    "the light curve shapes can vary based on the amount and spatial distribution of the surrounding material , but the smoothness of the uv light curves and their qualitative similarity to the optical light curves suggest a photospheric origin .",
    "a photospheric origin for the emission is supported by the uv spectra of sne 2009dc and 2012dn , which show stronger features in the muv ( below 2700  ) than seen in normal sne ia , while the flux from a hot shock would be relatively smooth and would dilute the photospheric features @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the optical features are also much stronger than for sn  2007if , for which the top lighting of a shock was invoked as one explanation for its diluted features and high luminosity @xcite .",
    "the uv spectra of sne 2009dc and 2012dn do not allow a smooth blackbody source for the excess flux .",
    "such a spectrum might be expected from a high temperature shock with a hydrogen - rich circumstellar medium , as was used to explain the diluted features of sn  2002ic ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "a structured spectrum with emission and absorption , due to reprocessing of the shock emission or originating from a different composition , can not be excluded .",
    "@xcite found adding a spectrum of the ibn sn  2006jc to their theoretical sn ia spectrum gave reasonable matches to the observed spectra of sn  2009dc .",
    "higher quality uv spectra of ibn and sc sne are needed to perform similar tests in the uv .",
    "nevertheless , photometric observations may already contain enough information to further constrain photometric ( e.g. @xcite ) or spectroscopic modeling ( e.g. @xcite ) .    while the optical light curves of sne 2011aa and 2012dn are not dissimilar to normal sne ia ( though extremely broad in the case of sn  2011aa ) , the nuv - optical and especially the muv - nuv ( or muv - optical ) colors are markedly different .",
    "the rest - frame uv also peaks earlier for sc than normal sne ia .",
    "early rest - frame uv photometry might allow optically overluminous sne such as sn  2009dc to be excluded from cosmological analysis .",
    "@xcite estimate the rate of sc sne to be a few percent of all sne ia locally , but a bias could result from an evolutionary shift @xcite if these are more common in the early universe than they are locally .",
    "@xcite show that the relative fractions of nuv - blue and nuv - red normal sne ia change with redshift .",
    "the origin of the uv diversity amongst normal and sc candidate sne ia may point to ways to reduce the dispersion at longer wavelengths and understand potential biases in sn ia standardization at different epochs in the history of the universe .",
    "bolometric light curve comparisons between models and observations serve as an important diagnostic of allowed models and parameters .",
    "the creation of bolometric light curves , however , especially the treatment of missing wavelength ranges , varies greatly .",
    "sometimes the nuv ( or at least the ground based u band ) is included , and the muv may or may not be included . often the uv portion of the flux is considered to be negligible ( a reasonable assumption in some cases ) .",
    "if it is included , it is often set at a constant percentage of the flux . as shown here",
    ", there is also a lot of variation in the nuv and muv flux fractions between various sne ia , and the fractions evolve quite significantly with time .",
    "the data given here will allow the bolometric light curves of these objects to be more accurately determined .",
    "for example , the falling uv fraction means that inclusion of the uv flux will broaden the pre - maximum rise of the bolometric flux . this could lead to a longer implied rise time if fit with a light curve template .",
    "this longer rise time may not be accurate , however , if the stretched light curve template did not include the uv in its construction .",
    "@xcite use multi - wavelength modeling to show the difference between a bvri , uv - optical - ir ( uvoir ) , and true bolometric light curve . the distinction between these is important .",
    "uv data will allow more constraints on the modelling .",
    "while we have pushed the knowledge of the uv behavior for sc sne ia @xmath23 days earlier , the very earliest epochs would also be important for looking for the effects of shock interaction with a non - degenerate companion @xcite or differences in the uv - optical flux evolution at the earliest times @xcite . as the uv - optical colors are still bluest at the first epochs observed , the bolometric contribution before then may be larger still and are in any case uncertain .",
    "higher quality uv spectra at the earliest possible epochs will better probe the mechanism responsible for the excess uv emission and how to account for it in mass determinations .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented uv / optical photometry and spectroscopy for three sne ia , 2009dc , 2011aa and 2012dn , which have been suggested as candidate super - chandrasekhar mass sne ia . while their optical properties are not dissimilar to normal sne ia , they are significantly bluer and more luminous in the uv than normal sne ia , with muv luminosities about a factor of @xmath24 higher .",
    "uv spectra of sne  2009dc and 2012dn feature structure not expected for shock interaction , suggesting a photospheric origin of the excess uv luminosity .",
    "the uv is shown to contribute significantly ( but still smaller than the optical ) to the bolometric luminosity , especially at early times .",
    "the integrated luminosities of sne 2011aa and 2012dn are much lower than 2009dc , however .",
    "this suggests a larger diversity in the class , if they are indeed in the same class , when considering uv and optical photometric and spectroscopic characteristics . a more detailed study of these sne is required to determine if they were above the chandrasekhar mass .",
