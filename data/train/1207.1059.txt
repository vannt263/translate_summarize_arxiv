    "<S> the ground - state phase diagram of a spin-@xmath0 xxz chain with competing ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) and antiferromagnetic second - neighbor ( @xmath2 ) exchange couplings is studied by means of the infinite time evolving block decimation algorithm and effective field theories . for the su(2)-symmetric ( heisenberg ) case , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the nonmagnetic phase in the range @xmath3 has a small but finite ferromagnetic dimer order . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this spontaneous dimer order is associated with effective spin-@xmath4 degrees of freedom on dimerized bonds , which collectively form a valence bond solid state as in the spin-@xmath4 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain ( the haldane spin chain ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus call this phase the haldane dimer phase . with easy - plane anisotropy , </S>",
    "<S> the model exhibits a variety of phases including the vector chiral phase with gapless excitations and the even - parity dimer and nel phases with gapped excitations , in addition to the haldane dimer phase . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show the existence of gapped phases with coexisting orders in narrow regions that intervene between the gapless chiral phase and any one of haldane dimer , even - parity dimer , and nel phases . possible implications for quasi - one - dimensional edge - sharing cuprates are discussed . </S>"
