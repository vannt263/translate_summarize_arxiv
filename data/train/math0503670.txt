    "thompson s groups @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 are a remarkable family of infinite , finitely - presentable groups studied for their own properties as well as for their connections with questions in logic , homotopy theory , geometric group theory and the amenability of discrete groups .",
    "cannon , floyd and parry give an excellent introduction to these groups in @xcite .",
    "these three groups can be viewed either algebraically , combinatorially , or analytically .",
    "algebraically , each has both finite and infinite presentations .",
    "geometrically , an element in each group can be viewed as a _ tree pair diagram _ ; that is , as a pair of finite binary rooted trees with the same number of leaves , with a numbering system pairing the leaves in the two trees .",
    "analytically , an element of each group can be viewed as a piecewise - linear self map of the unit interval :    * in @xmath1 as a piecewise linear homeomorphism , * in @xmath0 as a homeomorphism of the unit interval with the endpoints identified , and thus of @xmath3 , * in @xmath2 as a right - continuous bijection which is locally orientation preserving .",
    "thompson s group @xmath1 in particular has been studied extensively .",
    "the group @xmath1 has a standard infinite presentation in which every element has a unique normal form , and a standard two - generator finite presentation .",
    "fordham @xcite presented a method of computing the word length of @xmath4 with respect to the standard finite generating set directly from a tree pair diagram representing @xmath5 . regarding @xmath1 as a diagram group , guba @xcite also obtained an effective geometric method for computing the word metric with respect to the standard finite generating set .",
    "belk and brown @xcite have similar results which arise from viewing elements of @xmath1 as forest diagrams .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss analogues for @xmath0 of some properties of @xmath1 , using all three of the descriptions of @xmath0 : algebriac , geometric and analytic .",
    "we begin by desribing unique normal forms for elements which arise from their reduced tree pair descriptions .",
    "we consider metrically how @xmath1 is contained as a subgroup of @xmath0 , and show that the number of carets in a reduced tree pair diagram representing @xmath6 estimates the word length of @xmath5 with respect to a particular generating set .",
    "thus @xmath1 is quasi - isometrically embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we show that there are families of words in @xmath1 which are isometrically embedded in @xmath0 with respect to an alternate finite generating set .",
    "the groups @xmath0 and @xmath2 , unlike @xmath1 , contain torsion elements , and we describe how to recognize these torsion elements from their tree pair diagrams .",
    "finally , we show that every torsion element of @xmath0 is conjugate to a power to a generators of @xmath0 and that the subgroup of rotations in @xmath0 is quasi - isometrically embedded .",
    "thompson s groups @xmath1 and @xmath0 both have representations as groups of piecewise - linear homeomorphisms .",

    "breakpoints _ , have slopes which are powers of two and have the coordinates of the breakpoints all lie in the set of dyadic rationals . similarly , the group @xmath0 consists of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the circle @xmath3 satisfying the same conditions where we represent the circle @xmath3 as the unit interval @xmath7 $ ] with the two endpoints identified .",

    "we refer the reader to this paper for full details on results mentioned in this section .",
    "since more readers have some familiarity with @xmath1 than with @xmath0 , we first give a very brief review of the group @xmath1 , and then a slightly more detailed review of @xmath0 .",
    "algebraically , @xmath1 has well known infinite and finite presentations . with respect to the infinite presentation @xmath8 for @xmath1 ,",
    "group elements have simple normal forms which are unique .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath1 can be generated by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which form the standard finite generating set for @xmath1 , and yield the finite presentation    @xmath11,[x_0x_1^{-1},x_0^{-2}x_1x_0 ^ 2]\\rangle.\\ ] ]    a geometric representation for an element @xmath5 in @xmath1 is a tree pair diagram , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "tree pair diagram _ is a pair of finite rooted binary trees with the same number of leaves . by convention ,",
    "the leaves of each tree are thought of as being numbered from @xmath12 to @xmath13 reading from left to right .",
    "a node of the tree together with its two downward directed edges is called a _",
    "caret_. the _ left side _ of the tree consists of the root caret , and all carets connected to the root by a path of left edges ; the _ right side _ of the tree is defined analogously .",
    "a caret is called a _ left caret _ if its left leaf lies on the left side of the tree .",
    "a caret is called a _",
    "right caret _",
    "if it is not the root caret and its right leaf lies on the right side of the tree .",
    "all other carets are called _ interior_. a caret is called _ exposed _ if it contains two leaves of the tree . for @xmath4 , we write @xmath14 to express @xmath5 as a tree pair diagram , and refer to @xmath15 as the _ source _ tree and @xmath16 as the _ target _ tree .",
    "these trees arise naturally from the interpretation of @xmath1 as a group of homeomorphisms .",
    "thinking of @xmath5 as a homeomorphism of the unit interval , the source tree represents a subdivision of the domain into subintervals of width @xmath17 for varying values of @xmath13 , and the target tree represents another such a subdivision of the range .",
    "the homeomorphism then maps the @xmath18 subinterval in the domain linearly to the @xmath18 subinterval in the range .",
    "a tree pair diagram representing @xmath5 in @xmath1 is not unique .",
    "a new diagram can always be produced from a given tree pair diagram representing @xmath5 simply by adding carets to the @xmath19th leaf of both trees .",
    "we impose a natural reduction condition : if @xmath14 and both trees contain a caret with two exposed leaves numbered @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then we remove these carets , thus forming a representative for @xmath5 with fewer carets and leaves . a tree pair diagram which admits no such reductions",
    "is called a _ reduced tree pair diagram _ , and any element of @xmath1 is represented by a unique reduced tree pair diagram .",
    "when we write @xmath21 below , we are assuming that the tree pair diagram is reduced unless otherwise specified .",
    "the group @xmath0 also has both a finite and an infinite presentation .",
    "the infinite presentation is given by two families of generators , @xmath22 , the same generators as in the infinite presentation of @xmath1 , a family @xmath23 of torsion elements , and the following relators :    1 .",
    "@xmath24 , if @xmath25 2 .",
    "@xmath26 , if @xmath27 3 .",
    "@xmath28 4 .",
    "@xmath29 5 .   @xmath30 .",
    "this new family of generators @xmath31 ( of order @xmath32 ) , is simple to describe .",
    "the generator @xmath31 corresponds to the homeomorphism of the circle obtained as follows .",
    "both domain and range can be thought of as the unit interval with the endpoints identified .",
    "we subdivide the interval into @xmath33 subintervals by successively halving the rightmost subinterval ; or in other words inserting endpoints at @xmath34 .",
    "then the homeomorphism maps @xmath35 $ ] linearly to @xmath36 $ ] , and so on around each circle .",
    "for example , the element @xmath37 corresponds to the homeomorphism of @xmath3 given by @xmath38 figure [ fig : c1c2 ] shows the graphs of the homeomorphisms corresponding to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .     and @xmath40.[fig : c1c2],title=\"fig:\",width=480 ] +    using the first three relators , we see that only the generators @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath39 are required to generate the group , since the other generators can be obtained from these three . in the following , we will use @xmath37 to denote the generator @xmath39 .",
    "the group @xmath0 is finitely presented using the following relators , with respect to the finite generating set @xmath41 :    1 .   @xmath42=1 $ ] 2 .",
    "@xmath43=1 $ ] 3 .",
    "@xmath44 , ( that is @xmath45 ) 4 .",
    "@xmath46 , ( that is , @xmath47 ) 5 .",
    "@xmath48 , ( that is , @xmath49 6 .   @xmath50 .    as with thompson s group @xmath1",
    ", we will frequently work with the more convenient infinite set of generators when constructing normal forms for elements and performing computations in the group .",
    "we will need to express elements with respect to a finite generating set when discussing word length .",
    "there are two natural finite generating sets for @xmath0 , both extending the standard finite generating set for @xmath1 .",
    "the first and the one that we use primarily below is the generating set @xmath51 used in the finite presentation above . in section [ isomembed ] for the purposes of counting carets carefully , we also use the generating set @xmath52 , which has the advantage that the tree pair diagram for @xmath53 has only one caret , as opposed to @xmath39 , which has two carets , at the expense of slightly more complicated relators .",
    "just as for @xmath1 , tree pair diagrams serve as efficient representations for elements of @xmath0 .",
    "however , since elements of @xmath0 represent homeomorphisms of the circle rather than the interval , the tree pair diagram must also include a bijection between the leaves of the source tree and the leaves of the target tree to fully encode the homeomorphism .",
    "since this bijection can at most cyclically shift the leaves , it is determined by the image of the leftmost leaf in the source tree .",
    "since by convention this leaf in the source tree is already thought of as leaf @xmath12 , this information is recorded by writing a @xmath12 under the image leaf in the target tree .",
    "hence , for @xmath6 , a _ marked tree pair diagram _ representing @xmath5 is a pair of finite rooted binary trees with the same number of leaves , together with a mark ( the numeral 0 ) on one leaf of the second tree . as usual , we write @xmath14 to express @xmath5 as a tree pair diagram , and refer to @xmath15 as the _ source _ tree and @xmath16 ( the one with the mark ) as the _ target _ tree . we remark that to extend this to @xmath2 , since now the bijection of the subintervals may permute the order in any way , the marking required on the target tree to record the bijection consists of a number on every leaf of the target tree .",
    "just as for @xmath1 , there are many possible tree pair diagrams for each element of @xmath0 , which can be obtained by adding carets to the corresponding leaves in the source and target trees in the diagrams .",
    "however , when adding the carets , placement is guided by the marking .",
    "the leaves of the source tree are thought of as numbered from @xmath12 to @xmath13 reading from left to right , whereas the marking of the target tree specifies where leaf number @xmath12 of that tree is , and other leaves are numbered from @xmath54 to @xmath13 reading from left to right cyclically wrapping back to the left once you reach the rightmost leaf . with this numbering in mind",
    ", carets can be added as before to leaf @xmath19 of both trees . if @xmath55 , the mark stays where it is . otherwise , if @xmath56 , the mark on the new target tree is placed on the left leaf of the added caret .",
    "so for @xmath0 , we have a similar reduction condition : if @xmath14 and both trees contain a caret with two exposed leaves numbered @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then we remove these carets and renumber the leaves , moving the mark if needed , thus forming a representative for @xmath5 with fewer carets and leaves .    a tree pair diagram which admits no such reductions",
    "is again called a _ reduced tree pair diagram _ , and any element of @xmath0 is represented by a unique reduced tree pair diagram . in @xmath0 as well as in @xmath1 , when we write @xmath14 below , we are assuming that the tree pair diagram is reduced unless otherwise specified . checking whether or not a tree pair diagram is reduced is slightly more difficult in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 .",
    "the process of checking for possible reductions is illustrated in figure [ fig : reduction ] . a marked tree pair diagram for an element of @xmath0",
    "is shown on the top left of figure [ fig : reduction ] . in the top right tree pair diagram of figure [ fig : reduction ] , the underlying numbering of the leaves of both trees determined by the marking",
    "is written explicitly , revealing the reducible carets .",
    "the bottom tree pair diagram shows the resulting reduced diagram .    .",
    "the diagram on the top left is reducible ; the two dotted carets on the top right are paired with each other , since the numbering is identitcal .",
    "the resulting reduced diagram is shown on the bottom.[fig : reduction],title=\"fig:\",width=480 ] +    note that the torsion generators @xmath57 have particularly simple tree pair diagrams . in the diagram for @xmath57 ,",
    "both source and target trees consist of the root caret plus @xmath19 right carets .",
    "the mark @xmath12 is placed on the rightmost leaf of the target tree .    , @xmath40 and @xmath58 on top , plus @xmath31 on the bottom.[fig : cs],title=\"fig:\",width=499 ] +    figure [ fig : cs ] shows the the tree pair diagrams of the first three generators @xmath59 , and @xmath58 , together with a general @xmath31 .",
    "the generator @xmath53 is merely a pair of single caret trees , with the mark on the rightmost leaf of the target tree .",
    "whether @xmath4 or @xmath6 , we denote the number of carets in either tree of a tree pair diagram representing @xmath5 by @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 is a word in the generators of @xmath1 or @xmath0 , then @xmath61 represents an element @xmath5 in either @xmath1 or @xmath0 , and we write @xmath62 interchangeably with @xmath60 .",
    "group multiplication in @xmath1 and @xmath0 corresponds to composition of homeomorphisms , which we can interpret on the level of tree pair diagrams as well .",
    "first , we consider @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . to compute the tree pair diagram corresponding to the product @xmath66",
    ", we create unreduced representatives @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the two elements in which @xmath69",
    ". then the product is represented by the possibly unreduced tree pair diagram @xmath70 .",
    "the multiplication is written following the conventions on composition of homeomorphisms , so the product @xmath66 has as a source diagram that of @xmath71 , and as a target diagram that of @xmath72 .",
    "that is , the diagram on the left is the source of @xmath71 and the diagram on the right is the target of @xmath72 .    to multiply tree pair diagrams representing elements of @xmath0 we follow a similar procedure .",
    "we let @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath65 . to compute the tree pair diagram corresponding to the product @xmath66",
    ", we create unreduced representatives @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the two elements in which @xmath69 as trees . the product @xmath66 will be represented by the pair @xmath70 of trees .",
    "to decide which leaf in @xmath75 to mark with the zero , we just note that it should be the leaf which is paired with the zero leaf in @xmath76 .",
    "to identify this leaf , we find the zero leaf in @xmath77 . since @xmath78 as trees , this leaf viewed as a leaf in @xmath79 will be labelled @xmath80 .",
    "then the leaf labelled @xmath80 in @xmath75 will be the new zero leaf in the tree pair diagram @xmath70 for @xmath66 .",
    "alternately , we can follow the composition in both pairs of trees to see how the leaves are paired .",
    "this newly constructed tree pair diagram will represent @xmath66 and is not necessarily reduced . for an example of this multiplication , see figures [ fig : mult1 ] , [ fig : mult2 ] and [ fig : mult3 ] .     and",
    "@xmath72 in @xmath0.[fig : mult1],title=\"fig:\",width=499 ] +     and @xmath72 necessary for the multiplication @xmath66 in @xmath0 , with carets added to perform the multiplication indicated with dashes . now",
    "the target tree of @xmath71 has the same shape as the source tree of @xmath72 , allowing the composition.[fig : mult2],title=\"fig:\",width=499 ] +     obtained from figure [ fig : mult2 ] .",
    "the dotted carets must be erased to find the reduced diagram.[fig : mult3],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] +",
    "with respect to the infinite presentation for @xmath1 given above , every element of @xmath1 has a unique normal form .",
    "any @xmath5 in @xmath1 can be written in the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . however , this expression is not unique .",
    "uniqueness is guaranteed by the addition of the following condition : when both @xmath85 and @xmath86 occur in the expression , so does at least one of @xmath87 or @xmath88 , as discussed by brown and geoghegan @xcite .",
    "when we refer to elements of @xmath1 in normal form , we mean this unique normal form .",
    "if the normal form for @xmath4 contains no generators with negative exponents , we refer to @xmath5 as a _ positive word _ and similarly , we say a normal form represents a _ negative word _ if there are no generators with positive exponents .",
    "we call any word which has the form @xmath89 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath90 , a word in _",
    ", where @xmath61 is the positive part of the normal form and @xmath91 the negative part .",
    "the normal form for an element of @xmath1 is the shortest word among all words in @xmath92 form representing the given element .    to any ( not necessarily reduced ) tree pair diagram @xmath93 for an element of @xmath1 we may associate a word in @xmath92 form representing the element , using the _ leaf exponents _ in the target and source trees .",
    "when the leaves of a finite rooted binary tree are numbered from left to right , beginning with zero , the leaf exponent of leaf @xmath94 is the integer length of the longest path consisting only of left edges of carets which originates at leaf @xmath94 and does not reach the right side of the tree",
    ". a tree pair diagram then gives the word @xmath95 precisely when leaf @xmath96 in @xmath16 has exponent @xmath97 , leaf @xmath98 in @xmath15 has leaf exponent @xmath99 , and generators which do not appear in the word correspond to leaves with exponent zero .",
    "we think of this word as the @xmath92 factorization of the element given by the particular tree pair diagram .",
    "we call a tree an _ all - right tree _ if it consists of a root caret together with only right carets . note that if we let @xmath100 be the all - right tree with the same number of carets as @xmath15 or @xmath16 , then @xmath101 is a diagram for the word @xmath91 and @xmath102 is a diagram for word @xmath61 . on the other hand",
    ", any word in @xmath92 form can be translated into a tree pair diagram .",
    "it can be obtained by taking diagrams for @xmath61 ( respectively @xmath91 ) , which will have all right source ( respectively target ) trees .",
    "then , if one diagram has fewer carets , one adds right carets to its all - right tree , and of a corresponding path of right carets to its other tree , to make both diagrams have exactly the same all right tree .",
    "furthermore , under this correspondence for @xmath1 , reduced tree pair diagrams correspond exactly to normal forms .",

    "has @xmath103 thick edges ( a path of @xmath103 left edges going up without reaching the right side of the tree ) then the @xmath19-th leaf exponent is @xmath103 and the generator appearing in the normal form is @xmath104 .",
    "this single tree @xmath0 pictured above is the target tree of the tree pair diagram @xmath105 , where @xmath100 is the all - right tree with 12 leaves , and has leaf exponents 1,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0 , and 0 for the leaves 0 - 11 in order .",

    "this is precisely the situation when the normal form can be reduced by a relator of @xmath1 .",
    "thus the condition that the normal form is unique is exactly the condition that the tree pair diagram is reduced .",
