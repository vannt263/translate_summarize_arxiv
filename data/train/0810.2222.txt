    "the science of seti has always suffered from a lack of quantitative substance ( purely resulting from its reliance on one - sample statistics ) relative to its sister astronomical sciences . in 1961 ,",
    "frank drake took the first steps to quantifying the field by developing the now - famous drake equation , a simple algebraic expression which provides an estimate for the number of communicating civilisations in the milky way .",
    "unfortunately , its simplistic nature leaves it open to frequent re - expression , hence there are in fact many variants of the equation , and no clear canonical form . for the purpose of this paper",
    ", the following form will be used ( walters , hoover & kotra ( 1980 ) @xcite ) :    @xmath0    with the symbols having the following meanings : + @xmath1 = the number of galactic civilisations who can communicate with earth + @xmath2 = the mean star formation rate of the milky way + @xmath3 = the fraction of stars that could support habitable planets + @xmath4 = the fraction of stars that host planetary systems + @xmath5 = the number of planets in each system which are potentially habitable + @xmath6 = the fraction of habitable planets where life originates and becomes complex + @xmath7 = the fraction of life - bearing planets which bear intelligence + @xmath8 = the fraction of intelligence bearing planets where technology can develop + @xmath9 = the mean lifetime of a technological civilisation within the detection window + the equation itself does suffer from some key weaknesses : it relies strongly on mean estimations of variables such as the star formation rate ; it is unable to incorporate the effects of the physico - chemical history of the galaxy , or the time - dependence of its terms .",
    "indeed , it is criticised for its polarising effect on `` contact optimists '' and `` contact pessimists '' , who ascribe very different values to the parameters , and return values of @xmath1 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( ! ) .",
    "+ a decade before , enrico fermi attempted to analyse the problem from a different angle , used order of magnitude estimates for the timescales required for an earthlike civilisation to arise and colonise the galaxy to arrive at the conclusion that the milky way should be teeming with intelligence , and that they should be seen all over the sky .",
    "this lead him to pose the fermi paradox , by asking , `` where are they ? '' .",
    "the power of this question , along with the enormous chain of events required for intelligent observers to exist on earth to pose it , has lead many to the conclusion that the conditions for life to flourish are rare , possibly even unique to earth ( ward and brownlee ( 2000)@xcite . the inference by lineweaver",
    "( 2001)@xcite that the median age of terrestrial planets in the milky way is @xmath12 gyr older than earth would suggest that a significant number of earthlike civilisations have had enough time to evolve , and hence be detectable : the absence of such detection lends weight to the so - called `` rare earth '' hypothesis .",
    "however , there have been many posited solutions to the fermi paradox that allow eti to be prevalent , such as :    * they are already here , in hiding * contact with earth is forbidden for ethical reasons * they were here , but they are now extinct * they will be here , if mankind can survive long enough    some of these answers are inherently sociological , and are difficult to model .",
    "others are dependent on the evolution of the galaxy and its stars , and are much more straightforward to verify . as a whole , astrobiologists are at a tremendous advantage in comparison with drake and fermi : the development of astronomy over the last fifty years - in particular the discovery of the first extra solar planet ( mayor et al 1995 @xcite ) and some hundreds thereafter , as well as the concepts of habitable zones , both stellar ( hart 1979@xcite ) and galactic ( lineweaver et al 2004 @xcite ) - have allowed a more in - depth analysis of the problem .",
    "however , the key issue still affecting seti ( and astrobiology as a whole ) is that there is no consensus as to how to assign values to the key _",
    "biological _ parameters involved in the drake equation and fermi paradox . furthermore , there are no means of assigning confidence limits or errors to these parameters , and therefore no way of comparing hypotheses for life ( e.g. panspermia - review , see dose ( 1986)@xcite - or the `` rare earth '' hypothesis ( ward and brownlee ( 2000)@xcite ) .",
    "this paper outlines a means for applying monte carlo realisation techniques to investigate the parameter space of intelligent civilisations more rigorously , and to help assign errors to the resulting distributions of life and intelligence .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : method ] the techniques are described ; in section [ sec : inputs ] the input data is discussed ; in section [ sec : results ] the results from several tests are shown , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] the method is reviewed .",
    "the overall procedure can be neatly summarised as :    1 .",
    "generate a galaxy of @xmath13 stars , with parameters that share the same distribution as observations 2 .   generate planetary systems for these stars 3 .",
    "assign life to some of the planets depending on their parameters ( e.g. distance from the habitable zone ) 4 .   for each life - bearing planet , follow life s evolution into intelligence using stochastic equations",
    "this will produce one monte carlo realisation ( mcr ) of the milky way in its entirety .",
    "the concept of using mcr techniques in astrobiology is itself not new : recent work by vukotic & cirkovic ( 2007,2008)@xcite uses similar procedures to investigate timescale forcing by global regulation mechanisms such as those suggested by annis ( 1999)@xcite . in order to provide error estimates , this procedure must be repeated many times , so as to produce many mcrs , and to hence produce results with a well - defined sample mean and sample standard deviation .",
    "the procedure relies on generating parameters in three categories : stellar , planetary and biological .",
    "the study of stars in the milky way has been extensive , and their properties are well - constrained . assuming the stars concerned are all main sequence objects allows much of their characteristics to be determined by their mass .",
    "stellar masses are randomly sampled to reproduce the observed initial mass function ( imf ) of the milky way , which is taken from scalo & miller ( 1979)@xcite ( see * figure [ fig : imf ] * ) .",
    "+    stellar radii can then be calculated using ( prialnik 2000 @xcite ) :    @xmath14^{\\frac{n-1}{n+3}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 if the primary fusion mechanism is the p - p chain ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 if the primary fusion mechanism is the cno cycle ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "( please note that in this paper , the subscript @xmath19 denotes the sun , e.g. @xmath20 indicates the value of one solar mass ) .",
    "the luminosity is calculated using a simple mass - luminosity relation :    @xmath21^{3}\\ ] ]    the main sequence lifetime therefore is :    @xmath22^{-2}\\ ] ]    the stars effective temperature can be calculated , assuming a blackbody :    @xmath23^{1/4}\\ ] ]    the star s age is sampled to reproduce the star formation history of the milky way ( twarog 1980 @xcite ) , see * figure [ fig : sfh]*. +    the metallicity of the star is dependent on the metallicity gradient in the galaxy , and hence its galactocentric radius , @xmath24 .",
    "this is sampled so that the surface mass density of the galaxy is equivalent to that of the milky way ( assuming a simple two - dimensional disc structure ) :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the galactic scale length ( taken to be 3.5 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , given its galactocentric radius , the metallicity of the star , in terms of @xmath27 $ ] , is calculated using the simple parametrisation of the abundance gradient :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is taken to be 0.07 ( hou , prantzos and boissier ( 2000 ) @xcite ) .",
    "the star is then placed at its galactocentric radius into one of four logarithmic spiral arms ( mimicking the four main logarithmic spiral arms of the milky way , see * figure [ fig : starmap ] * ) . +    finally , stars are assigned planets based on their metallicity ( sampling the current metallicity relations for extrasolar planets , see * figure [ fig : p_planet ] * ) .",
    "some stars will have no planets , some will have only one , and some may have multiple systems ( based on the multiplicity of current extrasolar planetary systems ) .",
    "since the discovery of 51 peg b ( mayor et al 1995 @xcite ) , the data garnered on exoplanets has grown at an increasing rate . at the time of writing , there are over 300 known exoplanets , discovered with a variety of observational techniques ( radial velocity , transits , microlensing , etc ) .",
    "this data provides distributions of planetary parameters that can be sampled from : the planetary mass function ( pmf ) , the distribution of planetary orbital radii , and the host star metallicity distribution .",
    "+    therefore , as with the stellar parameters , a population of planets can be created around the parent stars , with statistical properties matching what can be observed . however ,",
    "this statistical data is still subject to strong observational bias , and the catalogues are still strongly incomplete .",
    "there is insufficient data to reproduce a distribution of terrestrial planets : therefore it is assumed that life evolves around the satellites of the planets simulated here .",
    "in essence , this constitutes a lower limit on the number of inhabited planets : the work of ida and lin ( 2004)@xcite shows that , as a function of metallicity , habitable terrestrial planets are comparable in frequency ( or higher ) than currently detectable giant planets .",
    "this data is hence still useful for illustrating the efficacy of the monte carlo method ( at least , until observations of terrestrial exoplanets become statistically viable ) .",
    "all this should be borne in mind when the results of this work are considered .",
    "+ two further parameters to be sampled , for which observational data is difficult to obtain , are @xmath30 , the probability that life can originate on a given planet , and @xmath31 , the number of biologically damaging events that a planet will experience during the evolution of its indigenous life ( such as local supernovae , gamma ray bursts ( annis 1999 ) , cometary impacts , etc ) . at this point",
    ", the model goes beyond relatively well - constrained parameters , and becomes hypothesis .",
    "@xmath31 is defined as a function of galactocentric radius - more resetting events ( most notably sne ) occur as distance to the galactic centre decreases :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is set to 5 , reflecting the so - called `` big five '' mass extinction events in the earth s fossil record ( raup and sepkoski ( 1982 ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that this is a simple parameterisation : the real distribution of resetting events is more complex , in particular for short grbs and type i sne , which have less well - defined spatial relationships .",
    "this simple expression is provided to prevent a blurring of the issue : future work will include a more rigorous expression .",
    "all planetary data was collected from the exoplanets encyclopaedia website ( http://exoplanet.eu ) : in total , 242 planets were used to construct the data , as these had entries in all required data fields .",
    "the model now enters the realm of essentially pure conjecture : all the available data for these parameters is derived from observations of a single biosphere , and hence there is little that can be done to constrain these parameters ( at least without making wide - ranging assumptions about the mechanisms of life as a whole ) .",
    "the model implicitly assumes the `` hard step '' scenario of evolution ( e.g. carter 2007@xcite ) , i.e. life must achieve essential evolutionary goals in order to become intelligent organisms with the ability to construct sufficiently complex technological artifacts .",
    "the key biological parameters are listed as follows :    * @xmath34 : the number of stages life must evolve through to become intelligent * @xmath35 : the time required for each of these stages to be reached * @xmath36 : the time required for an intelligent technological civilisation to form from life s creation * @xmath37 : the probability that a reset event will cause complete annihilation    the intelligence timescale @xmath36 is calculated by the following stochastic process : if life does evolve on a planet , @xmath34 is randomly sampled .",
    "the resetting events @xmath31 are placed uniformly throughout each of the stages . if @xmath38 , then any given stage may suffer several reset events .",
    "then the following procedure occurs for each stage @xmath39 :    1 .",
    "@xmath35 is sampled 2 .",
    "if a reset occurs , test if that reset results in annihilation : if annihilation occurs , life is exterminated , and the process ends ; otherwise , @xmath39 decreases by 1 .",
    "@xmath36 is increased by some fraction of @xmath35 ( or simply by @xmath35 if no resets occur ) 4 .",
    "increase @xmath39 by 1 , and return to 1    this procedure continues until either a ) life has reached the final stage ( an intelligent technologically capable civilisation has evolved ) , or b ) the intelligence timescale becomes greater than the main sequence lifetime of the parent star : @xmath40 .",
    "once a civilisation has formed , it is assumed that detectable signals or signal leakage begins to be emitted .",
    "this emission will continue until either ( a ) the civilisation destroys itself or ( b ) the parent star moves off the main sequence ( see next section ) .",
    "this in itself is a conservative estimate of the length of time a civilisation may be detected , as civilisations may in fact migrate between the stars , or use stellar engineering to prolong their parent s stars life .",
    "+ the @xmath37 parameter is defined as :    @xmath41    along with the metallicity gradient and the @xmath31 parameter specified in the previous sections , this defines a galactic habitable zone which mimics that defined by lineweaver et al ( 2004)@xcite : an annular region of the galaxy where the metallicity is sufficiently high for planets ( and life ) to form , and the number of biologically destructive events is sufficiently small ( and their destructive capability sufficiently low ) to allow life to evolve at all .",
    "+      once a technologically capable civilisation has formed , it must move through a `` fledgling phase '' : it is susceptible to some catastrophic event caused partially or fully by its own actions ( e.g. war , plague , catastrophic climate change , botched macro - engineering projects ) .",
    "this is described by the parameter @xmath42 : the probability that a fledgling civilisation will destroy itself .",
    "if a civilisation can survive this phase , it becomes sufficiently advanced to prevent such self - destruction events , and becomes stable , on a timescale @xmath43 .",
    "if a civilisation is destroyed , then it will survive some fraction of @xmath43 before destruction .",
    "+ what advanced civilisations can then do is at the behest of the user : civilisations may colonise all planets within their solar system , resulting in signals appearing on all planets in that system .",
    "probes may be sent into the galaxy at large , which could define an explorable volume of the galaxy for a given advanced civilisation .",
    "civilisations may even attempt to generate new biospheres on neighbouring planets - the `` directed panspermia '' model ( crick and orgel 1972 @xcite ) .",
    "the results in this paper assume colonisation of all _ uninhabited _ planets in the system will occur once a civilisation becomes advanced ( colonisation being an umbrella term for placing both manned and unmanned installations on the surface or in orbit of said planets ) .",
    "+ the key civilisation parameters are :    * @xmath43 : the timescale for a civilisation to move from `` fledgling '' to `` advanced '' . * @xmath42 : the probability that a fledgling civilisation will destroy itself .",
    "* @xmath44 : the lifetime of any signal or leakage from a civilisation    the signal lifetime of a self - destroying civilisation is :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is a uniformly sampled number between 0 and 1 .",
    "if the civilisation becomes advanced , this becomes    @xmath47    ( i.e. civilisations exist until their parent star leaves the main sequence ) . for a planet colonised by an advanced civilisation ,",
    "this is    @xmath48    at the end of any mcr run , each planet will have been assigned a habitation index based on its biological history .",
    "@xmath49    if the planet has habitation index 1 or 2 , the biological process has been ended by the destruction of the parent star .",
    "planets with an index of -1 or 1 may contain biomarkers in their atmosphere ( e.g. ozone or water spectral features ) which could be detected .",
    "planets with an index of 2 or higher will emit signals or signal leakage .",
    "planets with an index of 4 or 5 may display evidence of a postbiological civilisation or of large scale `` macro - engineering '' projects , e.g. dyson spheres ( dyson 1960@xcite ) .",
    "signals from these systems may even be consistent with those expected from kardashev type ii civilisations ( those which can harness all the energy of their parent star ) , and hence could produce characteristic stellar spectral signatures that earth astronomers could detect .",
    "when comparing hypotheses , it is important to keep the number of free parameters to a minimum . to achieve this , a biological version of the copernican principle",
    "is invoked : the terran biosphere is not special or unique .",
    "therefore , life on other planets will share similar values of characteristic parameters .",
    "this implies that many parameters can be held constant throughout all hypotheses : in particular , those that deal with the approach to intelligence .",
    "these are sampled from gaussian distribution functions ( assuming that each variable is the result of many subfactors , and implicitly applying the central limit theorem ) . the mean value for @xmath34 is taken to be 6 , reflecting the major stages life went through on earth - biogenesis , the advent of bacteria , the advent of eukaryotes , combigenesis , the advent of metazoans , and the birth of technological civilisation ( carter 2007 @xcite ) .",
    "100 mcrs were produced for each hypothesis : the parameters used for all testing can be found in * table [ tab : common]*. the three hypotheses tested are described below .",
    "this well - documented theory suggests life may spread from one originating planet to many others , causing life to form concurrently in multiple systems . in this model , if life forms on any planet in a star system , then other planets may be seeded , according to the following prescription :    @xmath50    life can move between planets if the distance between the destination planet and the original inhabited planet ( @xmath51 ) is sufficiently small , and the stellar luminosity is sufficiently low that ionising radiation will not destroy biological organisms in transit .",
    "it is assumed that life emerges on the original planet while a significant amount of planetary bombardment is in progress , and the seeding of other planets ( from rocky fragments expelled from the inhabited planet s surface by asteroid impacts ) is therefore effectively instantaneous .",
    "@xmath42 is specified _ a priori _ to be 0.5 , reflecting current ignorance about the development of extraterrestrial civilisation . +",
    "this hypothesis restricts panspermia to planets in the same star system only : unfortunately , the model is currently incapable of modelling the interesting possibility of interstellar panspermia ( napier 2004 @xcite , wallis and wickramasinghe 2004 @xcite ) .",
    "this in itself is strong motivation to improve the model further , and is left as an avenue for future work .      due to the current dearth of data on earth - like exoplanets ,",
    "the famous `` rare earth hypothesis '' ( ward and brownlee ( 2000)@xcite ) can not be tested fully .",
    "a different hypothesis is possible ( assuming jovian planets in the habitable zone may have stable earth - like moons on which life could arise ) with this code .",
    "the hypothesis is as follows : once life arises , it is assumed to be tenacious , and can easily evolve into intelligence : however , the initial appearance of life is itself hard : the planetary niche must satisfy certain criteria before life can evolve .",
    "the criteria are :    1 .",
    "the planet is in the stellar habitable zone 2 .",
    "the parent star mass is less than @xmath52 3 .",
    "the system has at least one extra planet ( protection from bombardment ) 4 .",
    "the star s metallicity must be at least solar or higher ( @xmath53 )    if _ all _ criteria are met , then life can evolve .",
    "@xmath42 is set to 0.5 for the same reason as previously .",
    "it should be noted again that this is significantly different from the rare earth hypothesis , and should not be considered as a comparison .",
    "a more accurate comparison would have the last few stages of life ( the development of metazoans and intelligent life ) be rare : this would be better suited for future work after the model has been refined .      as a final example , this hypothesis demonstrates the ability of the code to model more sociological hypotheses .",
    "life evolves easily on many planets , but the evolution towards intelligence and advanced civilisation is more complex .",
    "essentially , civilisations which arise too quickly are more susceptible to self - destruction , whereas those which take longer to emerge are more likely to survive the fledgling phase .",
    "this is parametrised as :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a normalisation constant which describes the minimum evolution timescale ( if @xmath56 , and each stage takes the minimum amount of time @xmath57 ) ( note : if this calculation is applied to mankind , our own destruction probability is around 0.8 ( ! ) ) .",
    "if a planet is in the habitable zone , then @xmath58 , in the same vein as the other hypotheses .",
    "it should be noted that this is an oversimplification : the potential existence of liquid water on enceladus and europa ( both outside the solar habitable zone ) suggests that @xmath30 should be a distribution in orbital radius with tails that extend outside the zone : however , for the purposes of this paper , a simple step function will be sufficient .",
    ".parameters used for all hypotheses [ tab : common ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the galactic habitable zone is similar to that for the panspermia hypothesis : the weak favouring of self - destruction can be seen in the right panel of * figure [ fig : rhisto_hare]*. comparing the data between this hypothesis and the panspermia hypothesis , both the qualitative and the quantitative behaviour is similar .",
    "this reflects the similarity of the two hypotheses in terms of biological parameters , and that the key difference is in the sociological parameter @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath59{ijaduncanforgan13a.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{ijaduncanforgan13b.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath59{ijaduncanforgan14a.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{ijaduncanforgan14b.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath59{ijaduncanforgan15a.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{ijaduncanforgan15b.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]",
    "the results for all three hypotheses show clear trends throughout . in all cases , the inhabited planets orbit low mass stars ( a symptom of the hot jupiter bias present in current data ) ; the signal lifetimes are correspondingly dependent on these masses ( as expected , given its functional form ) .",
    "the signal history of all three hypotheses shows a period of transition between low signal number and high signal number at around @xmath60 , again symptomatic of the biological copernican principle used to constrain @xmath35 , @xmath34 , etc .",
    "+ this paper has outlined a means by which key seti variables can be estimated , taking into account the diverse planetary niches that are known to exist in the milky way and the stochastic evolutionary nature of life , as well as providing estimates of errors on these variables .",
    "however , two notes of caution must be offered :    1 .",
    "the reader may be suspicious of the high precision of the statistics quoted : it is worth noting that the standard deviations of these results are indeed low , and the data is precise : but , its accuracy is not as certain .",
    "the output data will only be as useful as the input data will allow ( the perennial `` garbage in , garbage out '' problem ) .",
    "current data on exoplanets , while improving daily , is still insufficient to explore the parameter space in mass and orbital radii , and as such all results here are very much incomplete .",
    "conversely , as observations improve and catalogues attain higher completeness , the efficacy of the monte carlo realisation method improves also .",
    "future studies will also consider planetary parameters which are sampled as to match current planet formation theory , rather than current observations .",
    "the method currently does not produce a realistic age metallicity relation ( amr ) .",
    "age , metallicity and galactocentric radius are intrinsically linked in this setup : to obtain realistic data for all three self - consistently requires an improved three - dimensional galaxy model which takes into account its various components ( the bulge , the bar , etc ) , as well as the time evolution of the galaxy .",
    "future work will attempt to incorporate a more holistic model which allows all three parameters to be sampled correctly .",
    "in particular , future efforts will be able to take advantage of better numerical models for the star formation history ( e.g. rocha - pinto et al 2000 @xcite ) , and the spatial distribution of stars ( e.g. dehnen and binney 1998 @xcite ) .",
    "although this paper applies the `` hard step scenario '' to the biological processes modelled , the method itself is flexible enough to allow other means of evolving life and intelligence .",
    "the minutiae of how exactly the biological parameters are calculated do not affect the overall concept : this work has shown that it is possible to simulate a realistic backdrop ( in terms of stars and planets ) for the evolution of eti , whether it is modelled by the `` hard step '' scenario or by some other stochastic method . incorporating new empirical input from the next generation of terrestrial planet finders , e.g. kepler",
    "( borucki et al 2008 @xcite ) , as well as other astrobiological research into the model , alongside new theoretical input by adding more realistic physics and biology will strengthen the efficacy of this monte carlo technique , providing a new avenue of seti research , and a means to bring many disparate areas of astronomical research together .",
    "the author would like to thank the referee for valuable comments and suggestions which greatly improved this paper .",
    "the simulations described in this paper were carried out using high performance computing funded by the scottish universities physics alliance ( supa ) .",

    "<S> the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) has been heavily influenced by solutions to the drake equation , which returns an integer value for the number of communicating civilisations resident in the milky way , and by the fermi paradox , glibly stated as : `` if they are there , where are they ? '' . </S>",
    "<S> both rely on using average values of key parameters , such as the mean signal lifetime of a communicating civilisation </S>",
    "<S> . a more accurate answer must take into account the distribution of stellar , planetary and biological attributes in the galaxy , as well as the stochastic nature of evolution itself . </S>",
    "<S> this paper outlines a method of monte carlo realisation which does this , and hence allows an estimation of the distribution of key parameters in seti , as well as allowing a quantification of their errors ( and the level of ignorance therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it provides a means for competing theories of life and intelligence to be compared quantitatively . </S>",
