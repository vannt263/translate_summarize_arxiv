    "in recent years the consideration of exotic dark matter has become necessary in order to close the universe [ @xcite ] . in the currently favored supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model , the most natural wimp and candidate for cdm is the lsp , i.e. the lightest supersymmetric particle . in the most favored scenarios the lsp is the lightest neutralino , which can be simply described as a majorana fermion , a linear combination of the neutral components of the gauginos and higgsinos [ @xcite ] .",
    "its stability is guaranteed by imposing r - parity conservation , which implies that the lsp s can disappear only by annihilating in pairs .",
    "the simplest and most restrictive version of mssm with gauge coupling unification is based on the assumption of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with universal boundary conditions from gravity - mediated soft susy breaking .",
    "an interesting question is whether this scheme is compatible with exact ",
    "asymptotic \" unification of the three third family yukawa couplings .",
    "a positive answer to this question would be very desirable since it would lead to a simple and highly predictive theory .    in this presentation",
    "we summarize the results of refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] , aimed to answer the question of whether the simple version of the mssm with yukawa unification at the gut scale , can be compatible with the most restrictive phenomenological constrains , which are the correct predictions for @xmath0quark mass and @xmath1 , and satisfy the requirement that the relic abundance @xmath2 of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the universe does not exceed the upper limit on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) abundance implied by cosmological considerations .",
    "we consider the mssm embedded in some general supersymmetric gut based on a gauge group such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( where all the particles of one family belong to a single representation ) with the additional requirement that the top , bottom and tau yukawa couplings unify [ @xcite ] at the gut scale @xmath5 .",
    "ignoring the yukawa couplings of the first and second generation , the effective superpotential below @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the quark and lepton @xmath9 doublet left handed superfields of the third generation and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 the corresponding @xmath9 singlets .",
    "also , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the electroweak higgs superfields and @xmath15 . the gravity - mediated soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the scalar potential",
    "are given by @xmath16 @xmath17 where the @xmath18 s are the ( complex ) scalar fields and tildes denote superpartners .",
    "the gaugino mass terms in the lagrangian are @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the bino , winos and gluinos respectively . `",
    "asymptotic ' yukawa coupling unification implies @xmath23 based on @xmath24 supergravity , we take universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms at @xmath5 , i.e. , a common mass for the scalar fields @xmath25 , a common trilinear scalar coupling @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "also , a common gaugino mass @xmath28 is assumed at @xmath5 .",
    "our effective theory below @xmath5 depends on the parameters ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30    @xmath31 : :    and @xmath5 are evaluated consistently with the    experimental values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "we    integrate numerically the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for    the mssm at two loops in the gauge and yukawa couplings from    @xmath5 down to a common supersymmetry threshold    @xmath35 . from this energy to @xmath34 ,",
    "the rges of    the nonsupersymmetric standard model are used .",
    "@xmath36 : :    is estimated at the scale @xmath37 using the experimental    input @xmath38 .",
    "we incorporate    the susy threshold correction to @xmath39 from the    approximate formula of ref.[@xcite ] .",
    "it is about @xmath40 ,    for @xmath41 , leading to a value of    @xmath42 for    @xmath43 , while , for @xmath44 ,    we find a correction of about @xmath45 and    @xmath46 in the same range of    @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 : :    is found by fixing the top quark mass at the center of its    experimental range , @xmath49 .",
    "the value    obtained for @xmath50 after including supersymmetric    corrections is somewhat higher than the experimental limit .",
    "@xmath26 : :    , for simplicity we take @xmath51 .",
    "our results move very    little for negative values of @xmath26 bigger than about    @xmath52 , however lower negative values and positive    values of this parameter tend to increase the susy spectrum increasing    @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the limits on    @xmath2 imposes lower and upper bounds on    @xmath26 . @xmath53",
    ": :    as we will discuss later the electroweak symmetry breaking , when    yukawa unification is assumed , imposes a relation on the values of    @xmath25 and @xmath28 . on the other hand the    role of coannihilation    @xmath54@xmath55 make convenient to    express our results in terms of relative mass splitting    @xmath56 between the nlsp    and lsp .",
    "therefore we trade the gut values of    @xmath57 and @xmath58 by the    pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath47 and    @xmath59 .",
    "let us describe with more detail the last item above .",
    "assuming radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , we can express the values of the parameters @xmath60 ( up to its sign ) and @xmath61 at @xmath37 in terms of the other input parameters by means of the appropriate conditions @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar higgs masses .",
    "when unified yukawa couplings and a common value for @xmath64 and @xmath63 are assumed gut , we find both @xmath65 and @xmath66 negative at @xmath37 .",
    "however for certain values of @xmath25 and @xmath28 is possible to find values the pseudoscalar higgs , @xmath67 beyond a lower bound , considered to be @xmath34 in the present work .",
    "furthermore , the authors of ref .  [ @xcite ] found that , for every value of @xmath47 and a fixed value of @xmath68 , there is a pair of minimal values of @xmath25 and @xmath28 where the masses of the lsp and @xmath69 are equal .",
    "this is understood from the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath25 and @xmath28 given in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] : @xmath70 where all the coefficients are positive and @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which depend only on @xmath68 , are @xmath73 ( the constant turns out to be numerically close to @xmath74 ) . equating the masses of the lsp and @xmath69",
    "is equivalent to relating @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "then , for every @xmath47 , a pair of values of @xmath25 and @xmath28 is determined .",
    "we had included the full one  loop radiative corrections to the effective potential as given in the appendix e of ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "the values of the lsp , @xmath37 and the corresponding values of @xmath25 and @xmath28 are given in fig.1 .",
    "a significant problem , which may be faced in trying to reconcile yukawa unification and universal boundary conditions , is due to the generation of sizeable susy corrections to the @xmath0-quark mass [ @xcite ] .",
    "the sign of these corrections is opposite to the sign of the mssm parameter @xmath60 ( with the conventions of ref.[@xcite ] ) . as a consequence , for @xmath44 ,",
    "the tree - level value of @xmath75 , which is predicted from yukawa unification already near its experimental upper bound , receives large positive corrections which drive it well outside the allowed range .",
    "however , it should be noted that this problem arises in the simplest realization of this scheme . in complete models correctly incorporating fermion masses and mixing , @xmath75 can receive extra corrections which may make it compatible with experiment .",
    "so , we do not consider this @xmath0-quark mass problem absolutely fatal for the @xmath44 case .",
    "however in the alternative scenario , with @xmath41 , the @xmath0-quark mass receives negative susy corrections and can easily be compatible with data in this case .",
    "an example of the typical values we find is given in table i.    table i. values for the quark bottom mass .",
    "this scheme with @xmath41 , is severely restricted by the recent experimental results [ @xcite ] on the inclusive decay @xmath77 [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is well - known that the susy corrections to the inclusive branching ratio br(@xmath77 ) , in the case of the mssm with universal boundary conditions , arise mainly from chargino loops and have the same sign with the parameter @xmath60 . consequently , these corrections interfere constructively with the contribution from the standard model ( sm ) including an extra electroweak higgs doublet",
    "however , this contribution is already bigger than the experimental upper bound on br(@xmath77 ) for not too large values of the cp - odd higgs boson mass @xmath47 . as a result , in the present context with yukawa unification and hence large @xmath36 , a lower bound on @xmath47",
    "is obtained for @xmath41 . on the contrary ,",
    "for @xmath44 , the susy corrections to br(@xmath77 ) interfere destructively with the sm plus extra higgs doublet contribution yielding , in most cases , no restrictions on the parameters .",
    "the results corresponding to the parameters given in fig.1 are shown in fig.2 . in the case of @xmath41 ,",
    "br(@xmath77 ) decreases as the splitting between @xmath78 and @xmath79 increases .",
    "the cosmological constraint on the parameter space results from the requirement that the relic abundance @xmath2 of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the universe does not exceed the upper limit on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) abundance implied by cosmological considerations ( @xmath80 is the present energy density of the lsps over the critical energy density of the universe and @xmath81 is the present value of the hubble constant in units of @xmath82 ) .",
    "taking both the currently available cosmological models with zero / nonzero cosmological constant , which provide the best fits to all the data , as equally plausible alternatives for the composition of the energy density of the universe and accounting for the observational uncertainties , we obtain the restriction @xmath83 ( see refs.[@xcite ) ] .",
    "assuming that all the cdm in the universe is composed of lsps , we further get @xmath84 .    the cosmological relic density of the lightest neutralino @xmath54 ( almost pure @xmath20 ) in mssm with yukawa unification increases to unacceptably high values as @xmath79 becomes larger .",
    "low values of @xmath79 are obtained when the nlsp ( @xmath69 ) is almost degenerate with @xmath54 . under these circumstances ,",
    "coannihilation of @xmath54 with @xmath69 and @xmath85 is of crucial importance reducing further the @xmath54 relic density by a significant amount .",
    "the important role of coannihilation of the lsp with sparticles carrying masses close to its mass in the calculation of the lsp relic density has been pointed out by many authors ( see e.g. , refs.[@xcite ) ] . here",
    ", we will use the method described by griest and seckel [ @xcite ] . note that our analysis can be readily applied to any mssm scheme where the lsp and nlsp are the bino and stau respectively .",
    "the relic abundance of the lsp at the present cosmic time can be calculated from the equation : @xmath86 with @xmath87 here @xmath88 gev is the planck scale , @xmath89 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom at freeze - out and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being the freeze - out photon temperature .    in our case",
    ", @xmath92 takes the form @xmath93 for @xmath94 , we use the nonrelativistic approximation @xmath95 @xmath96 here @xmath97 , 1 , 1 ( @xmath98 , @xmath69 , @xmath85 ) is the number of degrees of freedom of the particle species @xmath99 with mass @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the photon temperature .",
    "the freeze - out temperatures which we obtain here are of the order of @xmath103 and , thus , our nonrelativistic approximation ( see eq.([ri ] ) ) is justified . under these circumstances ,",
    "the quantities @xmath104 are well approximated by their taylor expansion up to second order in the ` relative velocity ' , @xmath105 the thermally averaged cross sections are then easily calculated @xmath106    the contribution of the @xmath107 s to the cross section is more important than the than the @xmath108 s since its contribution is suppressed by a factor @xmath109 .",
    "the annihilation cross section is suppressed respect the coannihilation channels due to the fact that @xmath110 is suppressed due to fermi statistics [ @xcite ] .",
    "this suppression is not present in the coannihilation channels , however its contribution to @xmath92 is attenuated by the exponential in @xmath111 in eq .",
    "therefore coannihilations have an important effect in decreasing the @xmath80 when the lsp and the nlsp are very close in mass . in our case",
    "we find this effect negligible when the mass splitting @xmath112@xmath113 is greater than approximately 20% .",
    "the complete list of feynman diagrams and the expressions for the @xmath107 s appropriate for large @xmath36 are given in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "the result of including coannihilation of @xmath69 and @xmath54 in the computation of the lsp relic abundance is clearly shown in fig.3 .",
    "the effect of increase the mass splitting between @xmath69 and @xmath54 will result in larger values for @xmath80 .",
    "we have shown that the condition of  asymptotic \" yukawa unification on the mssm results in a significant constraint on the free parameter space of the model .",
    "constraints from @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be simultaneously satisfied for @xmath41 and relatively large values of the susy parameters @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the constraint derived from cosmological limits on lsp relic abundance , is satisfied only when bino ",
    "stau coannihilations are relevant . if we superpose figs . 1 , 2 , 3",
    "we can observe that the previous conditions are satisfied in a narrow band of parameter space .",
    "the hight values of @xmath118 in the parameter space allowed by the constraints described above will make difficult its direct detection .",
    "however the large @xmath36 scheme can provide interesting predictions [ @xcite ] if one relaxes the strict unification condition imposed in the present study .",
