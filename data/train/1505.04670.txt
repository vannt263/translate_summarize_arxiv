    "inflation  @xcite is now widely accepted as a successful way of producing the flat and isotropic universe as well as small density perturbations as seeds for galaxies .",
    "it is triggered by the potential energy of a scalar field called inflaton , which slowly rolls down its potential during inflation  @xcite .",
    "for successful reheating , inflaton inevitably couples to light particles , and this coupling may induce sizable radiative corrections to its effective potential .",
    "even if this is not the case , there might be a self interaction term of the inflaton . as a result",
    ", it might contradict with the present observational data by producing too large density perturbations  @xcite . among several approaches to this issue ,",
    "one way is to generalize the interaction between inflaton and gravity to flatten its effective potential .",
    "however , the coupling of inflaton to gravity in general produces higher derivatives in their equations of motion .",
    "since it can induce other degrees of freedom which might lead to ghost instabilities , it would be desirable to construct models without introducing new degrees of freedom .",
    "there is a class of theories with a scalar field and gravity , called generalized galileons@xcite , which do not suffer from such higher derivatives .",
    "efforts have been made to study general setups for using these theories in inflation ( generalized g - inflation@xcite ) , and such theories are under close investigation especially after the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc@xcite and after the results from planck satellite@xcite , in the context of identifying the inflaton as the higgs field@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the oscillation regime of the generalized galileon theories in the context of inflation , because it is necessarily in order to understand the full reheating dynamics and construct a consistent cosmological scenario . in fact , it has recently been pointed out that in some models of the generalized g - inflation the hubble parameter oscillates violently during the inflaton oscillation regime@xcite , which makes the analysis of expansion law of the universe non - trivial and also it may lead to laplacian instability  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the expansion law of the universe in these models is also necessarily to make a precise prediction for the spectral index of the density perturbation , for example . for these purposes ,",
    "we construct a useful quantity , which we call an adiabatic invariant , in analyzing the background dynamics .",
    "the expansion law of the universe during inflaton oscillation regime is easily derived by using this invariant .",

    "we define @xmath30 as a typical frequency of the inflaton oscillation in the following discussion . in general , @xmath30 may be estimated as @xmath31 . in the inflaton oscillation regime ,",
    "the inequality @xmath32 is satisfied .",
    "as we will explicitly see in the next section , the hubble parameter and the energy density of the inflaton violently oscillate with time in some models , _",

    "may be interpreted as generalization of the hubble parameter and the energy density to the case of the generalized galileon theories , respectively .      in this subsection",
    ", we schematically describe the procedure to evaluate the cosmic expansion law by using the adiabatic invariant that we have derived just above .",
    "some specific examples of this procedure will be given in the next section .    in order to obtain the expansion law ,",
    "we first evaluate the scale factor dependence of @xmath41 .",
    "let us start with eq .  .",
    "we have to express the oscillation average of @xmath46 by that of @xmath47 .",
    "the oscillation average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomconst ] ) gives @xmath48 where the angular bracket denotes an oscillation average which smears out the oscillation with the frequency of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomphi ] ) with @xmath5 and taking an oscillation average , we obtain the virial theorem : @xmath50 where we have taken only leading terms with respect to @xmath51 . here , note that usually @xmath46 can be decomposed into at most three terms which are proportional to @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath47 , if one neglects small terms in each regime under consideration .",
    "see also examples in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] .",
    "thus , from eqs .   and together with such a decomposition , one can express @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : eoma ] ) can be rewritten by taking the oscillation average as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is @xmath58 numerical coefficient which can be determined explicitly if we specify the model .",
    "here we used the fact that @xmath44 is an adiabatic invariant , and thus @xmath59 . also remember that @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "( [ eq : lhdifeq ] ) can be used to express @xmath44 as a function of the scale factor @xmath17 . since we know the relations among @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , in general we can express @xmath44 only by @xmath64 , _",
    "@xmath65 , where @xmath66 is some number .",
    "then , the scale factor dependence of @xmath64 and hence the expansion law of the universe can be estimated .",
    "we will see how this procedure works for some specific models in the next section .      as we said repeatedly ,",
    "the hubble parameter can violently oscillate with time for the general lagrangian  .",
    "in such a case , the violent oscillation of the background metric causes production of non - weyl invariant particles  @xcite . here , we briefly summarize basic ingredients of such a particle production event .",
    "more detailed discussion is given in  @xcite    we call the produced ( scalar ) particle @xmath67 here .",
    "the parameter , @xmath68 , is defined as @xmath69 where we have assumed that the @xmath67 s mass squared has an oscillating part @xmath70 due to the inflaton oscillation .",
    "then , the decay rate of @xmath5 is estimated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the canonically normalized amplitude of @xmath5 . in the case",
    "where @xmath67 is minimally coupled to gravity and the bare mass of @xmath67 is negligible , the effective mass of canonically normalized @xmath67 is given by the hubble parameter squared and its time derivative since the normalization of @xmath67 depends on the scale factor .",
    "hence , the decay rate is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the oscillating part of the hubble parameter .",
    "here , we have used the fact that @xmath75 is always satisfied in the inflaton oscillation regime .",
    "note that by using the fact that @xmath44 is an adiabatic invariant , the oscillating part of the hubble parameter can easily be deduced from the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath23 .",
    "this is another benefit of the adiabatic invariant .",
    "we will see this point for some specific models in the next section .",
