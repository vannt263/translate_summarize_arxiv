    "t  tauri stars are considered to resemble our sun at an age of a few million years .",
    "studies of their surrounding gas and dust can therefore provide important clues on the early evolution of the solar nebula .",
    "it is well established through surveys at infrared and millimeter wavelengths that most t  tauri stars have circumstellar disks with masses of @xmath11 m@xmath12 and sizes of @xmath13  au ( see overviews by @xcite , dutrey et al .",
    "1996 , mundy et al .",
    "in addition to serving as a conduit for mass accretion onto the young star , the disks also provide a reservoir of gas and dust for the formation of potential planetary systems ( shu et al .",
    "theories of disk evolution depend strongly on the radial and vertical temperature structure of the disks ( e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) , but these parameters are still poorly constrained by the available observations .",
    "we report here the results of a deep survey for the lowest two pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 , the @xmath1=@xmath14 s(0 ) line at 28.218 @xmath3 m and the @xmath15 s(1 ) transition at 17.035 @xmath3 m , using the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) . in emission ,",
    "the h@xmath0 lines originate from levels at 509.9  k and 1015.1  k above ground and are thus excellent tracers of the `` warm '' ( @xmath1680  k ) gas in disks , especially in the interesting inner part where jovian planets may form .",
    "h@xmath0 has the advantage that it dominates the mass budget and that it does not deplete onto grains , contrary to co. moreover , the lines are optically thin up to very high column densities owing to the small einstein @xmath17 coefficients for electric quadrupole transitions , so that the modeling of the radiative transfer is simple .    here we present h@xmath0 pure rotational line observations of the gg tau system , which is situated at the edge of the taurus - auriga cloud complex at a distance of approximately 140 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "gg  tau consists of two close binary pairs separated by 10@xmath18 , or 1400 au .",
    "the main binary gg  tau a has a separation of @xmath19  au ( ghez et al .",
    "1997 ) and is composed of a k7 and a m0.5 star ( white et al .",
    "1999 ) , both classified as emission - line or `` classical '' t  tauri stars by herbig & bell ( 1988 ) with an estimated accretion rate of 2 @xmath20 10@xmath21 m@xmath12 yr@xmath22 ( hartmann et al .",
    "the gg tau b binary is comprised of an m5 and m7 star separated by @xmath23 au .",
    "the age of the gg tau system is estimated to be @xmath24 myrs by white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using the evolutionary models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and assuming the four stars to be coeval .",
    "high spatial resolution images taken in the near infrared show that each of the stars in the gg tau a system has associated circumstellar material within a radius of less than 10  au ( roddier et al .",
    "these stars are located within a cavity of radius @xmath25 au cleared by the dynamical interaction of the binary ( ghez et al .",
    "1997 ) , and a circumbinary disk extending up to @xmath26 au as imaged at millimeter wavelengths ( dutrey et al .",
    "1994 , guilloteau et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the circumbinary disk mass of @xmath27 m@xmath12 , deduced from the strong millimeter dust continuum and assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 100:1 , is one of the largest observed to date ( guilloteau et al .",
    "however , observations of @xmath28co and c@xmath29o indicate gas masses that are up to a factor of 100 lower , ( dutrey et al .   1994 ) . explanations for this discrepancy include the possible freeze - out of co in the cold outer part of the disk and/or a gas dissipation time scale that is shorter than that of the dust ( zuckerman et al .",
    "the h@xmath0 observations presented here allow a direct measurement of the amount of warm gas in the disk .",
    "the h@xmath0 data for gg  tau form part of a survey of a larger number of t tauri and herbig ae stars with the iso - sws by thi et al .",
    "( 1999a ; and in preparation ) .",
    "an initial account of the results has been given in van dishoeck et al .",
    "the low - lying pure - rotational h@xmath30 @xmath31 s(0 ) line at 28.218 @xmath3 m and the @xmath15 s(1 ) line at 17.035 @xmath3 m were observed with the iso - sws in the aot02 mode ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were centered in the direction of gg  tau a at ra(2000)=04@xmath3232@xmath3330@xmath34 , dec(2000)=17@xmath3531@xmath3642@xmath18 .",
    "typical integration times were 6001000  s per line , in which the 12 detectors were scanned several times over the 28.0528.40 and 16.9617.11 @xmath3 m ranges around the lines . the @xmath37 s(3 )",
    "9.66 @xmath3 m and @xmath38 s(5 ) 6.91 @xmath3 m lines were measured in parallel with the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines , respectively , at virtually no extra time .",
    "the spectral resolution for point sources is 2000 ( 150 km s@xmath22 ) at 28 @xmath3 m , 2400 ( 125 km s@xmath22 ) at 17 @xmath3 m , 2280 ( 130 km s@xmath22 ) at 9.7 @xmath3 m and 1550 ( 195 km s@xmath22 ) at 6.9 @xmath3 m .",
    "the sws apertures are @xmath39 at s(0 ) , @xmath40 at s(1 ) , and @xmath41 at the s(3 ) and s(5 ) lines .",
    "two independent sets of observations have been carried out in orbital revolutions 668 and 834 .",
    "the expected peak fluxes of the h@xmath0 lines are close to the sensitivity limit of the instrument , and the raw data show a high level of noise induced by charged - particle impacts on the detectors . in order to extract the h@xmath0 lines , special software designed to handle weak signals was used for the data reduction in combination with the standard interactive analysis package .",
    "the details and justification of the methods used in the software are described by valentijn & thi ( 1999 ) .",
    "because the mid - infrared continuum emission from gg tau is weak , @xmath421 jy at @xmath4217 @xmath3 m and @xmath10 jy at 28 @xmath3 m , the data do not suffer from fringing effects caused by an inadequate responsivity function correction .",
    "the h@xmath0 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines are detected in both sets of observations ( see table  1 ) and the differences in fluxes between the two sets are @xmath43% .",
    "this is well within the estimated total error of @xmath44% , which is mostly due to uncertainties in the flux calibration .",
    "the s(3 ) and s(5 ) lines are not detected down to a limit of @xmath45 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the spectra of the h@xmath30 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines are displayed in figure  1 for revolution 668 . since the turbulent and rotational velocities in disks are only a few km s@xmath22 , respectively , both lines are unresolved . after subtraction of the continuum ,",
    "the lines are fitted by gaussians with widths fixed by the instrumental resolution and the line fluxes are computed from @xmath48 to @xmath49 hwhm .    in the optically thin limit ,",
    "the observed line fluxes are directly related to the populations in the h@xmath0 @xmath1=2 and 3 levels . the derived kinetic temperature assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is @xmath50  k , where the error bar reflects the 30% uncertainty in the fluxes .",
    "although the @xmath1=3 level has a factor of 40 lower population than the @xmath1=2 level in gas with a temperature near 100  k , the radiative transition probability of the s(1 ) line , @xmath51 s@xmath22 , is much larger than that of the s(0 ) transition , @xmath52 s@xmath22 .",
    "in addition , the spectral resolution at 17  @xmath3 m is somewhat higher than that at 28 @xmath3 m , and the line - to - continuum ratio is correspondingly larger . both of these factors explain why the s(1 ) line is detectable as well .",
    "the limits on the s(3 ) and s(5 ) lines imply temperatures less than @xmath53  k and @xmath54  k , respectively , neglecting any correction for differential extinction .    since the iso beam is much larger than the size of the circumbinary disk , it is important to check whether any of the observed h@xmath0 emission may arise from residual extended envelope or cloud material .",
    "h@xmath0 lines up to s(9 )",
    "are readily detected toward embedded herbig ae stars with the iso - sws ( e.g. , van den ancker et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the emission is dominated by the interaction of the young star with its surrounding envelope through shocks and ultraviolet photons .",
    "the typical h@xmath0 excitation temperatures for these regions are @xmath55=500700  k , much larger than the value found for gg tau .",
    "deep iso searches for the h@xmath0 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines toward diffuse and translucent clouds have been performed by thi et al.(1999b ) .",
    "the lines are not detected down to @xmath56 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 ( @xmath57 ) in gas with densities of a few hundred to a few thousand @xmath58 exposed to the normal interstellar radiation field .",
    "the @xmath59co 10 emission around gg  tau is less than 50 mk ( 3@xmath60 ) ( @xcite ) , more than an order of magnitude lower than found for diffuse clouds such as that toward @xmath61  oph .",
    "the corresponding mass in the sws beam is estimated to be less than a few @xmath62 m@xmath12 , significantly lower than the mass derived from the h@xmath0 lines ( see below ) .",
    "keck images of gg tau in @xmath63 continuum and h@xmath0 emission in the @xmath64=1@xmath20 and @xmath64=2@xmath21 s(1 ) lines at 2.1250 and 2.2486 @xmath3 m were obtained on 03 and 06 november 1998 using the facility near infrared camera ( nirc ) and the appropriate filters .",
    "no h@xmath0 emission down to @xmath65 @xmath3jy ( 2@xmath60 ) was detected in a 1.5 - 6@xmath18 ( i.e. 200 - 800 au ) radius around the stars , nor outside this region .",
    "this translates to a limit on the intensity of @xmath66 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 sr@xmath22 .",
    "altogether , we are confident that the bulk of the h@xmath0 emission toward gg tau originates from the disk(s ) rather than interstellar material in the iso beam .",
    "assuming no continuum extinction and lte excitation , the corresponding mass of warm gas is computed via the relation @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the integrated flux in erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 , @xmath69 is the distance of gg  tau in pc ( taken to be 140 pc ) , @xmath70 is the frequency of the transition in hz , and @xmath71(@xmath16 ) is the fractional population in the upper rotational level @xmath72 .",
    "the derived amount of warm gas is ( 3.6 @xmath732.0 ) @xmath20 10@xmath74 m@xmath12 ( 3@xmath60 ) , including the 30% uncertainty in the fluxes .",
    "the derivation assumes that the ortho / para h@xmath0 ratio is @xmath75 , the lte value at 110  k. if the emission were affected by 30 magnitudes of visual extinction , the derived excitation temperature would increase to 121 k and the mass to @xmath76 10@xmath74 m@xmath12 .",
    "the inferred warm h@xmath0 mass of @xmath77 10@xmath74 m@xmath12 is about 3% of the total gas + dust mass of 0.12 m@xmath12 derived from millimeter continuum observations of the circumbinary disk assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 100:1 and a gas + dust absorption coefficient of 0.01 @xmath78 g@xmath22 at 2.6 mm ( guilloteau et al .",
    "the temperature is much higher than that derived from the continuum spectral energy distribution and optically thick co emission , which give a temperature of only 34  k at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk at 180 au .    where does the warm h@xmath0 emission originate and what is the heating mechanism ?",
    "the bulk of the circumbinary disk is too cold to account for emission by gas at 100 k. moreover , the disk is optically thick in the mid - infrared continuum .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission must therefore arise either from the circumstellar disk(s ) , or from the surface layers and inner edges of the circumbinary disk .",
    "two kinds of heating mechanisms may be at work : heating by absorption of part of the stellar and accretion luminosity , and heating by dynamical processes including shocks and turbulent decay .",
    "these possibilities are discussed in turn below .",
    "several radiative processes must be examined .",
    "the first possibility is that the h@xmath30 lines arise from material within @xmath79  au around the individual stars , where the gas and dust are heated by the ultraviolet radiation from the ysos . in general , a large fraction of this warm gas in the inner circumstellar disk(s ) may be hidden by the optically thick continuum of colder surrounding dust , especially if the disks are observed nearly edge on .",
    "however , gg tau presents a special case , since the dynamical interaction of the binary has cleared the inner part of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the near - infrared observations of roddier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that at least some of the radiation from the inner disks can escape through holes in the circumbinary disk combined with favorable orientations of the material .",
    "the masses of the inner circumstellar disks are estimated to be only @xmath80 m@xmath12 each , however , based on the millimeter continuum data ( guilloteau et al .",
    "it therefore does not appear that there is sufficient mass in the inner disks to explain the warm h@xmath0 emission .",
    "consider next the case of the more extended circumbinary disk . if this disk is flared , as is expected if hydrostatic equilibrium is approached , there exists a surface layer that is heated by radiation from the central star(s ) to temperatures near 100 k out to radii of @xmath81 au ( e.g. , chiang & goldreich 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "these disk models have a non - isothermal vertical temperature profile , and the warm gas is located in the near - surface regions of the disk .",
    "thus , the emission arising from the heated material is not absorbed by cooler layers before reaching the earth . an h@xmath0 excitation calculation has been performed using the density and temperature structure of the standard model of chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) , assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100:1 with @xmath82 .",
    "typical s(0 ) and s(1 ) fluxes from a single face - on surface layer are @xmath83 and @xmath84 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "these values depend sensitively on the adopted continuum opacities at mid - infrared wavelengths and the geometry , resulting in uncertainties of factors of 23 . even taking these factors into account , however ,",
    "the model fluxes are a factor of 510 lower than the observed values . moreover , the model s(0)/s(1 ) ratio of 0.4 is lower than the observed ratio of @xmath85 , and the model s(3)/s(1 ) ratio of 0.4 is higher than the observed ratio of @xmath420.2 . a more detailed radiative transfer simulation including the disk inclination angle of @xmath86 ( roddier et al .  1996 , guilloteau et al .",
    "1999 ) and possible velocity shifts between the warm and cold gas is needed to provide a more accurate assessment of this model , but is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "a third radiative mechanism may be provided by ultraviolet radiation from the star - inner disk boundary layer(s ) which can irradiate the inner edge of the circumbinary disk ( or any residual gas in the cavity ) and heat it to @xmath87  k. this situation has been described for circumstellar envelopes by spaans et al .",
    "the intensity of the ultraviolet radiation from a 10,000  k boundary layer with a luminosity of 0.3@xmath88 is estimated to be up to a factor of 600 larger than the average interstellar radiation field at a distance of @xmath89 au .",
    "if the density at the boundary is assumed to be a few@xmath90 @xmath58 , the computed h@xmath0 fluxes are @xmath91 and @xmath92 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 for the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines , respectively , an order of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "similar discrepancies between models and h@xmath0 observations are found for dense interstellar clouds exposed to ultraviolet radiation ( e.g. , draine & bertoldi 1999 ) , indicating that the heating mechanisms are not fully understood .",
    "the s(0)/s(1 ) ratio of @xmath24 and s(3)/s(1 ) ratio of @xmath93 in these models are consistent with the data within the errors , however .",
    "further modeling of the radiative heating of the surface layer and inner edge of the circumbinary disk is needed to investigate whether a combination of these radiative mechanisms can reproduce the observations .",
    "an alternative class of heating mechanisms involves shocks caused by infalling material at the inner disk surface(s ) or by the interaction between an outflowing supersonic wind and the surfaces of the circumstellar or circumbinary disk(s ) ( hartmann & raymond 1989 ) .",
    "evidence for such winds comes from optical observations of atomic and ionic lines , from which hartigan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) derive a mass loss rate of 7.9 @xmath20 10@xmath94 m@xmath12 yr@xmath22 for gg tau . since the masses of the inner circumstellar disk(s ) are too low to explain the h@xmath0 emission , only the interaction of the wind with the circumbinary disk at @xmath89  au needs to be considered .",
    "the problem with these models is that shocks are expected to warm the surface layers to sufficiently high temperatures to emit strongly in the s(5 ) and s(3 ) lines and the 2 @xmath3 m vibration - rotation lines .",
    "consider as an example the wind - disk models of hartmann & raymond ( 1989 ) .",
    "for typical wind velocities of 200 km s@xmath22 , the estimated shock velocities along the disk surface range from 2040 km s@xmath22 at distances of 50200 au .",
    "comparison with the @xmath1 and @xmath95shock models of burton , hollenbach & tielens ( 1992 ) and kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) shows that in virtually all models the flux in the s(3 ) line is predicted to be larger than that in the s(1 ) line , in contrast with the observations . using the s(3)/s(1 ) ratio as a constraint , at most 30% of the s(1 ) emission",
    "could be contributed by shocks .",
    "the lack of detected h@xmath0 @xmath64=1@xmath20 s(1 ) emission also indicates the absence of shocks faster than @xmath65 km s@xmath22 .",
    "thus , the h@xmath0 s(3 ) and 2 @xmath3 m upper limits suggest that heating by shocks is unlikely to be the major contributor to the line emission",
    ". most likely , a combination of heating by ultraviolet photons and dynamical processes is responsible for the warm molecular gas .    in summary",
    ", this work demonstrates that h@xmath0 pure rotational lines can be detected from disks around pre - main sequence stars and that they provide complementary information to sub - millimeter observations of co and other molecules .",
    "the h@xmath0 observations are particularly sensitive to the warm gas in the disks . with current instrumentation , masses of warm h@xmath0",
    "can be detected that are only a small fraction of the total gas + dust mass in circumstellar disks .",
    "the line ratios provide important constraints on the heating mechanisms . in order for the h@xmath0 emission to escape , however",
    ", the emission must arise either from the disk surface layers or requires the presence of gaps or holes in the disks . in the case of gg",
    "tau , the binary nature of this system has cleared a large inner cavity in the circumbinary disk , which may have facilitated the detection of the lines .",
    "future observations at higher spectral and spatial resolution such as provided by mid - infrared spectrometers on ground - based telescopes and aboard platforms such as the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( sofia ) and the _ next generation space telescope _ ( ngst ) , accompanied by more sophisticated modeling , should be able to clarify the origin of the h@xmath0 emission from disks around t tauri and herbig ae stars and allow much more sensitive searches .",
