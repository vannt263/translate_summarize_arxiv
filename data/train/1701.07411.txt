    "consumer spending is an essential component of the economy , accounting for 71% of the total us gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2013  @xcite . in spite of representing just over 10% of all consumer spending  @xcite",
    ", online shopping is rapidly growing as people are becoming more comfortable with the online payment systems , security and delivery of the purchased goods . over the last three years",
    ", online sales grew over @xmath3  @xcite and are showing signs of exponential growth .",
    "one of the largest and fastest - growing online markets is apple s ios market , where people can make digital purchases from several different categories .",
    "apple s revenue from digital purchases surpassed $ 20 billion in 2015  @xcite and more than doubled in just three years  @xcite .",
    "mobile digital markets offer a wide variety of digital goods , including apps , songs , movies , and digital books .",
    "they also include items that users can buy within an app , called _ in - app purchases _ , such as virtual currencies , bonuses , extra game lives and levels , etc . despite the popularity of the ios market",
    ", there has not been a large - scale study characterizing users spending on different types of content and apps .",
    "for example , it is not known how much is spent on in - app purchases compared to songs . learning how people spend their money in this context",
    "has direct practical implications on the business of several stakeholders , including app developers and managers of online app stores , but it also has important theoretical implications for the understanding of consumer behavior in an emerging market whose dynamics are still poorly known .    we study a longitudinal data set extracted from hundreds of millions of email receipts for digital purchases on iphones , ipads , and other ios devices ( which we refer to as `` iphone purchases '' for brevity ) . besides its large scale , our data has two unprecedented advantages over other data collected in the past .",
    "first , besides recording the purchase history , it also includes _ demographic information _ such as people s age , gender , and country of residence .",
    "this enables us not only to characterize the consumer population , but also study how spending differs by income and location .",
    "for example , we find that the average spending is not correlated with income but strongly depends on the country of residence . and second , in contrast to the application - centric view of previous studies , our data is user - centric and allows for the observation of user spending behavior across _",
    "multiple apps_. this allows us to study how users abandon an app and start using a new one , and to compare the behavior of users who make purchases from a single app with users who make purchases from multiple apps simultaneously .",
    "we analyze how users spend money across different categories and show that a small fraction of users are responsible for the majority of spending .",
    "we call these users _ big spenders_. moreover , our analysis informs predictive models of digital spending behavior .",
    "we first show that the time between purchases is best described by a pareto distribution .",
    "we then build a supervised classifier that accurately predicts whether a user will make a purchase from a new app or one with previous purchases .",
    "finally , based on the outcome of the previous step , we predict the exact app from which the user will purchase .    in summary ,",
    "our main findings and contributions are as follows :    * in - app purchases account for 61% of all money spent on digital purchases on iphones , followed by songs ( 23% ) and app purchases ( 7% ) . * the spending is highly heterogeneous : the top 1% of spenders account for 59% of all money spent on in - app purchases . *",
    "big spenders tend to be 3 - 8 years older , 22% more likely to be a man , and 31% less likely to be from the us , compared to the typical spender .",
    "interestingly , income is comparable between the big spenders and the rest of the users . *",
    "big spenders become slower to repurchase from an app as time passes , but their rate of spending within an app initially increases , then decreases . *",
    "from the perspective of app developers and ad networks , big spenders are the most valuable targeting segment . even if they abandon an app that they are frequently buying from , they are 4.5x more likely to be a big spender in a new app compared to a random user .",
    "* we model the purchasing process in several steps : modeling time between purchases , predicting purchase from a new app or an app from which the user has already purchased , and predicting the exact app of an in - app purchase .",
    "both consumers and producers in the mobile app market might benefit from this study .",
    "our results can inform the deployment of better app recommendation systems so that people download apps they are more likely to enjoy , thus creating higher revenue opportunities for app developers .",
    "shortly after each digital purchase on an iphone ( or any other ios device ) , the user receives a confirmation email with details of the purchase .",
    "this email contains information about the purchase , including the amount of money spent and the type of purchase .",
    "the email has a specific format , making it easy to parse automatically .",
    "we obtained information about digital purchases of yahoo mail users , using an automated pipeline that hashes the names and ids of users to preserve anonymity .",
    "all the analyses were performed in aggregate and on unidentifiable data .",
    "we gathered data covering 15 months , from march 2014 to june 2015 .",
    "our data set includes 26 m users , who together made more than 776 m purchases totaling $ 4.6b .",
    "there are six main categories of iphone purchases : applications ( apps ) , songs , movies , tv shows , books , and in - app purchases ( purchases within an app , e.g. , bonuses or coins in games ) .",
    "these categories differ vastly in numbers of purchasers : 16 m people purchased at least one song , but only 671k people purchased a tv show . the number of purchases by category varies greatly as well : there are 430 m song and 255 m in - app purchases , while movies , books , and tv shows have fewer than 40 m purchases all together .",
    "the total money spent in each category varies even more : in - app purchases account for $ 2.8b , or 61% , of all money spent on digital purchases ; 23% of the money is spent on songs , 7% on app purchases ( purchasing apps themselves , not the purchases within apps ) , 6% on movies , 2% on books , and only 0.7% on tv shows .",
    "even though there are considerably fewer total in - app purchases compared to songs ( 60% fewer ) , the money spent on in - app purchases is 2.7 times more than on songs , showing that on average an in - app purchase is much more expensive than a song purchase .",
    "figure  [ fig : bar_all ] shows the number of users , purchases , and the money spent in each of these six categories .        our data set also includes user age , gender , and zip code as provided by the users at the time of sign up .",
    "spending varies significantly based on demographics .",
    "figure  [ fig : spending_gender ] shows the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the spending for men and women .",
    "men spend more money on purchases than women : the median spending for women is $ 31.1 , and for men it is $ 36.2 , which is 17% higher .",
    "age also affects spending : figure  [ fig : spending_age ] shows that the peak age for iphone spenders is the mid-30s , and after that the spending level decreases quickly . for us residents we use the median income of the zip code they declared as their residence as an estimate of their income .",
    "this estimate has shown meaningful trends in earlier work  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , income only affects the spending of people with less than $ 40k annual income ( figure  [ fig : spending_income ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast with online shopping , where users with higher income tend to spend more money shopping online  @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     & accuracy + app embeddings & 4.7% + nmf & 4.1% + top apps & 2.2% + lda & 1.7% +    [ table : baselines_knn ]      in the case that the model from section  [ subsec : novelty ] predicts that a re - purchase is most likely to happen , we use the frequency and recency of the user s previous app consumption to predict the app from which the re - purchase will occur .",
    "this may appear to be an easy prediction problem , as one might think that users almost always purchase from the last app they purchased from , or the app from which they made the majority of purchases .",
    "however , in case of in - app re - purchases , only 46.5% of re - purchases come from the latest app they purchased from , and only 45.3% of them come from the app from which the user made most of the purchases . this justifies the need for a more involved re - purchase model .",
    "we follow a similar approach to the one from  @xcite , and use both recency and popularity of previous apps to predict from which app the user s next in - app purchase will come .",
    "we use a weight function and a time function that maps the frequency of the usage and time since previous usage to the learnt values .",
    "this repeat consumption model could be used for the @xmath4th consumption :    @xmath5    in this equation , function @xmath6 represents the frequency of the purchase from the app , and function t represents the time between the purchases .",
    "these functions are optimized jointly by calculating the negative log - likelihood over the equation .",
    "the negative log - likelihood is not convex in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but is convex in each function when the other one is fixed .",
    "thus , we use a standard gradient descent to maximize the likelihood with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , separately . after learning the weight functions , we are able to predict the correct app from which the user is going to make a purchase with 54.8% accuracy , which is considerably higher than the baselines mentioned above , i.e. 46.5% and 45.3% accuracy by always predicting the latest or the most consumed app , respectively .",
    "online shopping is becoming more popular as people learn to trust online payment systems , which was not the case in the past  @xcite .",
    "multiple studies , aimed at profiling online shoppers , found that online shoppers tend to be younger , wealthier , and more educated compared to the average internet user  @xcite .",
    "a more recent work showed that while women are more likely to be online shoppers , men spend more money per purchase and make more purchases overall  @xcite . in our work , we focus on a particular subset of online purchases , iphone digital purchases .",
    "there are considerable differences in characteristics of iphone purchases and purchases of physical goods .",
    "one of the main differences is that people are much more likely to purchase the same item multiple times .",
    "similar to online shopping , spending on mobile digital goods is increasing , and people have spent more than $ 20 billion dollars in the apple app store in 2015  @xcite , which is four times more per user than in android app stores . this might be due to the different demographics of iphone users .",
    "given this high level of spending , understanding the market would help us to more effectively target apps toward users who are likely to become regular users and frequent spenders . despite the popularity of the iphone digital market , there has not been any large - scale study of how people are spending money on this platform . in this work ,",
    "we show that most of the money is spent on in - app purchases , and we present a demographic and prediction analysis of spending .",
    "usage and purchases from apps have been the subject of a few studies .",
    "sifa et al . studied the purchase decisions in free - to - play mobile games  @xcite .",
    "they built a classifier that predicts whether a user is going to make any purchase in the future and also built a regression model to estimate the amount of money that will be spent by each user .",
    "the models are moderately accurate .",
    "schoger studied the monetization of popular apps in the global market , identifying growing markets and that in - app purchases are increasingly accounting for a larger fraction of total purchases  @xcite .",
    "our study , unlike those studies , includes the full history of iphone purchases by the users and considers that many users make purchases from multiple apps .",
    "moreover , the large scale of the data set allows us have enough big spenders to analyze their behavior accurately .",
    "we also study changes in user purchases over time , how users becomes frequent buyers in a particular app , and how their purchases evolve over time .",
    "the abandonment of a service is called _ consumer attrition _ or _",
    "churn_. the importance of consumer attrition analysis is driven by the fact that retaining an existing consumer is much less expensive than acquiring a new consumer  @xcite .",
    "thus , prediction of consumer churn is of great interest for companies , and has been studied extensively . for example .",
    ", ritcher et al .",
    "exploit the information from users social networks to predict consumer churn in mobile networks  @xcite .",
    "braun and schweidel focus on the causes of churn rather than when churn will occur  @xcite .",
    "they find that a considerable fraction of churn in the service they studied happens due to reasons outside the companies control , e.g. , the consumer moving to another state . in the context of mobile games , runge et al .",
    "study user churn for two mobile games and predict it using various machine learning algorithms  @xcite . they also implement an a / b test and offer players bonuses before the predicted churn .",
    "they find that the bonuses do not result in longer usage or spending by the users .",
    "kloumann et al .",
    "study the usage of apps by users who use a facebook login and model the lifetime of apps using the popularity and sociality of apps , showing that both of these affect the lifetime of the app  @xcite .",
    "baeza - yates et al . addressed the problem of predicting the next app the user is going to open through a supervised learning approach  @xcite . in our work , we model the whole sequence of purchases that users make , including adoption , churn , and prediction of the next app .",
    "our work is the first work that studies the details of all iphone purchases made by a large number of users .",
    "this allows us to better understand the interplay between usage of multiple apps that are competing for the same users , their attention and their purchasing power .",
    "mobile devices have grown wildly in popularity and people are spending more money purchasing digital products on their devices . to better understand this digital marketplace , we studied a large data set of more than 776 m purchases made on iphones , including songs , apps , and in - app purchases .",
    "we find that , surprisingly , 61% of all the money spent is on in - app purchases , and a small group of users are responsible for most of this spending : the top 1% of users are responsible for 59% of all spending on in - app purchases .",
    "we characterize these users , showing that they are more likely to be men , older , and less likely to be from the us .",
    "then , we focus on how these big spenders start and stop making purchases from apps , finding that as users gradually lose interest , the delay between purchases increases .",
    "the amount of money spent per day on purchases initially increases , then decreases , with a sharp drop before abandonment .",
    "nevertheless , from the perspective of app developers these big spenders are a valuable user segment as they are 4.5x more likely to be a big spender in a new app than a random app user . in the last part of our study",
    ", we model the purchasing behavior of users by breaking it down into three different steps .",
    "first , we model the time between purchases by testing a variety of different distributions , and we find the pareto distribution fits the data most accurately .",
    "second , we take a supervised learning approach to predict whether a user is going to make purchase from a new app .",
    "finally , if the purchase is from a new app , we use a novel approach to predict the new app based on the previous in - app purchases . if the purchase is from an app that the user purchased from in the past , we combine the earlier frequency of the purchases and the time between the purchases to predict from which app the re - purchase will come .",
    "the models proposed in our study can be leveraged by app developers , app stores and ad networks to better target the apps to users ."
