    "in east - asia , since 2004 , grb optical follow - up observations have been carried out by the cooperation at japan , taiwan and china . due to the nature of the grb detection , the target of opportunity ( too ) programs",
    "have been provided by the lulin ( taiwan ) , kiso ( japan ) and xinglong ( china ) observatories .",
    "since there was a blank in the east asia region , the follow - up observations are expected to provide valuable observations for grb fields . the position and different advantages of each site , reduce the risk of bad weather , allowing us to cover an observational range to up dec @xmath0 degrees , and provide a complete light curve in multi - wavelengths . moreover , the 2.16 m telescope at xinglong observatory is able to perform spectral observations quickly , as soon as the optical afterglows have been located . by monitoring the observational ranges of _",
    "hete-2 _ and",
    "_ swift _ , _ widget _ is capable of detecting the early optical emission of grbs .",
    "the too system has been prepared for prompt grb follow - up observations at kiso observatory since 2001 @xcite . the kiso observatory is located in nagano - prefecture , japan , and has a 105 cm schmidt telescope and two other instruments .",
    "one is an optical 2k@xmath12k ccd camera , the other is a near infrared camera named konic ( kiso observatory near - infrared camera ) . the 2k@xmath12k camera s fov . is 50 @xmath150 arcmin and its limited magnitudes are 22.0 mag , 22.5 mag , 21.0 mag , 21.0 mag .",
    "( for each b , v , r , i band , 10 @xmath2 , 900 sec exposure ) . the konic s fov .",
    "is 20 arcmin .",
    "there are also two objective prisms , which allow low - dispersion slit less spectroscopy with 2k @xmath1 2k ccd with the fov . 50 @xmath150 arcmin . for grb021004",
    ", we could obtain the early afterglow spectrum using the low dispersion slitless spectrograph with an objective prism , well before an optical transient position was reported @xcite .",
    "widget is a robotic telescope that monitor the _ hete-2 _ and large part of the _ swift _ field of view , to detect optical flashes or possible optical precursors @xcite . since widget has a @xmath3 f.o.v .",
    ", we would uniformly obtain optical light curves before grbs .      the lulin grb program based on the kiso grb optical observation system @xcite , started in july 2003 using the lulin one - meter telescope ( lot ) in taiwan . the advantage of the lot that it is able to perform small cadence @xmath4band time series photometry .",
    "the position of lulin allows for further the observations of the southern sky .",
    "moreover , with its better seeing and weather conditions , lulin is capable of performing more grb observations than kiso either or xinglong @xcite .",
    "bejing observatory s xinglong station is located in xinglong county , hebei province , china .",
    "the brightness of the sky background on a moon - less night is @xmath5 = 22.2 , @xmath6 = 21.0 , @xmath7 = 20.3 , @xmath8 = 18.8 @xmath9 @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "two telescopes participate in the east - asia grbs cooperation .",
    "one is a 2.16@xmath11 m telescope , which is able to perform optical and near - infrared low - dispersion spectral observations for grb afterglows by using the optic - metrics research spectrograph with tektronix 1024@xmath11024 ccd .",
    "typically there are about 210 spectroscopic night per year .",
    "the other is the 80@xmath11 cm cassegrain telescope , which is capable of automatically response to gamma - ray burst alerts to perform @xmath4band follow - up observations . the f.o.v .",
    "is about @xmath12 .",
    "up to march 2005 , ten follow - up observations have been provided by the ease - asia grb observations in response to the alerts from _ hete-2 _ , _ integral _ and _ swift_. we could provide the upper limits of magnitude for eight events .",
    "two optical afterglows were detected , grb 040924 and grb 041006 .",
    "the results for the two detected afterglows will be described in the following .",
    "the optical afterglows of short grbs were elusive until the detection @xcite of grb 040924 by _ hete-2 _ on 2004 sep .",
    "24 , at 11:52:11 ut .",
    "this event lasted about 1.2  s and was x - ray rich according to the _ hete-2 _ flux in the 730  kev and 30400  kev bands .",
    "the konus - wind satellite also detected this event with 1.5  s duration in the 20300  kev band @xcite . since the high - energy spectrum of grb 040924 is soft @xcite , the object might actually be near the short - duration end of the long grbs .",
    "the @xmath13-band and @xmath6-band measurements were made at the luln observatory between 3 and 9 hours after the burst .",
    "our optical afterglow observations show that the temporal evolution , power - law index , and @xmath14 color of grb 040924 are also consistent with those of well - observed long grbs .",
    "the signature of a break in the light curve , as suggested by our present data , can be explained by the afterglow model , by invoking a early cooling break @xcite .      since it was night time in japan when the burst occurred .",
    "the follow - up started at kiso , 0.56 hours after the burst . since the report by costa et",
    "al ( 2004)@xcite had not yet reached us , we attended to cover the entire _",
    "_ error region .",
    "we made 300 sec @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath15 band imaging observations with exposure . in all bands ,",
    "the afterglow was detected clearly .",
    "an example of the @xmath15 band image is shown in figure 1@xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the position of the optical afterglow is close to the standard star field of sa92 reported by landolt ( 1992)@xcite . to image optical afterglow and several standard stars from sa92 simultaneously , we pointed the telescope 5 arcmin to the east .",
    "since the weather conditions at lulin were cloudy at the time of the burst , we had to wait for the weather to inprove before retrieve .",
    "meantime , we noticed , from our preliminary kiso results that the afterglow evolution in the @xmath5 and @xmath15 bands was significantly different .",
    "accordingly , we decided to focus on monitoring in these two particular bands .",
    "we were finally able to start the afterglow observation at the lulin observatory at 7.65 hours after the burst .",
    "as planned in advance , we took 300 sec @xmath5 and @xmath15 band image exposure . from 2.25 hours",
    ", we also performed @xmath15 band imaging observations at the beijing observatory , china .",
    "based on the preliminary @xmath5 and @xmath15 band photometry results form kiso , the afterglow was estimated te be slightly too faint to conduct multi color observations using the beijing 60 cm telescope .",
    "therefor , we focused on @xmath15 band monitoring",
    ". thus , thanks to our east asian network , we were able to obtain multi - band information in an early phase with least interruptions , in spite of rather unstable weather conditions at the individual sites .",
    "the multi - band light curve of the grb 041006 afterglow is shown in figure 1 . there",
    ", we plot our @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath15 band points together with several unfiltered and @xmath15 band points reported to gcn @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-band light curve shows a clear plateau around 0.03 days after the burst , although its behavior in earlier epochs remains unknown .",
    "the @xmath15 band light curve shows a hint of plateau , or a possible slope change , around 0.1 days after the burst .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath15 band photometric points obtained by our east asian cooperation plays an important role in characterizing the temporal evolution of the afterglow .",
    "as is obvious in figure 1 , the @xmath15 band light curve is poorly described by a single power - law ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath18=7 ) .",
    "however , the data subsets for @xmath19 days and @xmath20 days can be successfully described by separate single power - law models .",
    "we obtained @xmath21 with @xmath22 for @xmath23 , before 0.04 days , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 for @xmath26 , after 0.15 days .",
    "thus , the overall behavior of these multi band light curves may be understood as the sum of two separate components , one showing a monotonic decay while the other having a rising and falling phases .",
    "we thank the staff and observers at the kiso , lulin and xinglong observatories for the various arrangements .",
