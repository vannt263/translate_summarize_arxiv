    "but it is not possible to associate a value of temperature to this probability .    to make the connection between the bond frustrated percolation formalism and the random walk picture we introduce the local bond density autocorrelation function @xmath107    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the number of lattice edges , @xmath110 is the lattice dimension and @xmath111 if the i - th bond is missing and @xmath112 if the i - th bond is present .",

    "in fully frustrated models we have numerically found an exponential relaxation above the percolation temperature @xmath6 , while for @xmath120 the long time tail of the relaxation functions can be fitted with a stretched exponential in both @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 systems .",

    "in particular , the role can be understood considering the physical meaning of the percolation transition in a generalization of the sg model ( the @xmath8-state potts sg @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that the percolation transition marks the appearing of the `` large scale '' effects of frustration . below the percolation temperature , because of the presence of a spanning cluster , bond loops of any dimension may be closed , and therefore global effects of frustration are observed .",
    "note that in a previous paper @xcite we also studied a model , the `` locally frustrated bond percolation '' , in which only frustrated loops whose length is equal to four were forbidden .",
    "the model exhibits the same critical properties as the random bond percolation , showing that this kind of frustration is `` too local '' to change the universality class of transition .",
