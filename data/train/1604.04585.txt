    "meshfree methods are popular tools for solving problems of interpolation and numerical resolution of differential equations .",
    "they take advantage of being flexible with respect to geometry , easy to implement in higher dimensions , and can also provide high order convergence . recently , in approximation theory a specific method has been proved to be effective for interpolation of large scattered data sets , the partition of unity method .",
    "its origin can be found in the context of partial differential equations ( pdes ) @xcite . in scattered data interpolation",
    "it is implemented using rbfs as local approximants , since this is the most efficient tool for interpolation of scattered data @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage of radial kernel - based method is the computational cost associated with the solution of ( usually ) large linear systems , therefore recent researches have been directed towards a change of the basis , either rendering them more stable , or considering a local method involving rbfs ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "we focus on the localized rbf - based partition of unity approximation .",
    "as the name of the partition of unity method suggests , in such local approach , the efficient organization of scattered data is the crucial step .",
    "precisely , in literature , techniques as _ kd - trees _ , which allow to partition data in a @xmath0-dimensional space , and related searching procedures have already been designed @xcite .",
    "even if such techniques enable us to work with high dimensions , they are not specifically implemented for the partition of unity method .    in this paper , starting from the results shown in @xcite , where efficient searching procedures based on the partition of underlying domains in strips or crossed strips are considered , we propose a versatile software for bivariate and trivariate interpolation which makes use of a new partitioning structure , named _ block - based partitioning structure _ , and a novel related searching procedure .",
    "it strictly depends on the size of the partition of unity subdomains .",
    "such technique allows to deal with a truly large number of data with a relatively low computational complexity .",
    "more precisely , our procedure for bivariate and trivariate interpolation consists in covering , at first , the reconstruction domain with several non - overlapping small squares or cubes , named _",
    "blocks_. then the usually large scattered data set is distributed among the different blocks by recursive calls to a sorting routine .",
    "once the scattered data are stored in such blocks , an optimized searching procedure is performed enabling us to solve the local interpolation problems arising from the domain decomposition .",
    "specifically , such structure , built ad hoc for the partition of unity method , enables us to run the searching procedure in constant time complexity , independently from the initial number of nodes .",
    "an extensive complexity analysis supports our findings and moreover comparisons with other common techniques , as kd - trees , will be carried out .",
    "interpolating large scattered data sets using procedures competitive with the most advanced techniques is thus our main purpose .",
    "a second meaningful feature of our procedures is the flexibility with respect to the problem geometry . in general , in literature the scattered data interpolation problem is considered in very simple and regular domains , such as squares or cubes @xcite .",
    "this approach is limiting in the context of meshfree methods because of the versatility of the meshless technique with respect to domains having different shapes .",
    "instead in this work , our aim is to provide an automatic software that allows to solve scattered data interpolation problems in generic domains .",
    "specifically , here we focus on convex domains .",
    "this choice is due to the fact that our scope consists in solving interpolation problems in domains which are , in general , a priori unknown , i.e. problems arising from applications @xcite .    in what follows , in order to point out the versatility of the software , we will investigate several applications of such algorithm . for 2d data sets we stress the importance of having such versatile tool in biomathematics , presenting a short sketch about the reconstruction of the attraction basins @xcite .",
    "the same approach can also be employed in the approximation of the so - called _ sensitivity surfaces _",
    "then , for 3d data sets , we analyze the problem of modeling implicit surfaces via partition of unity interpolation @xcite .",
    "it is known that the reconstruction of 3d objects is computationally expensive because of the large amount of data .",
    "thus , the importance of having an efficient partitioning structure in such framework follows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ prelim ]",
    "we recall theoretical preliminaries on local rbf - based partition of unity approximation . in section [ block_algs ] , we describe in detail the block - based partition of unity algorithms for bivariate and trivariate interpolation , which are based on the use of the new block - based partitioning and searching procedures . computational complexity of these interpolation algorithms is then analyzed in section [ comp_cost ] . in section [ num_exp ]",
    "we report numerical experiments devoted to point out the accuracy of our algorithms .",
    "section [ appl ] contains some applications in biomathematics and cagd .",
    "section [ conclusion ] deals with conclusions and future work .",
    "we point out that the algorithms are made available to the scientific community in a downloadable free software package :    http://hdl.handle.net/2318/158790 .",
    "in this section we briefly review the partition of unity approximation based on a localized use of rbf interpolants .",
    "this computational technique is meshfree and effectively works with large sets of scattered data points @xcite .      given a set @xmath1 of @xmath2 distinct _ data points _ , also called _ data sites _ or _ nodes _ , in a domain @xmath3 , and a corresponding set @xmath4 of _ data values _ or _ function values _",
    "obtained by possibly sampling any ( unknown ) function @xmath5 , the standard rbf interpolation problem consists in finding an interpolant @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the euclidean norm , and @xmath9 is a rbf @xcite . the coefficients @xmath10 are determined by enforcing the interpolation conditions @xmath11 imposing the conditions leads to a symmetric linear system of equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15^t$ ] , and @xmath16^t$ ] .",
    "when @xmath17 is found by solving the system , we can evaluate the rbf interpolant at a point @xmath18 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the interpolation problem is well - posed , i.e. a solution to the problem exists uniquely , if and only if the matrix @xmath21 is nonsingular .",
    "a sufficient condition to have nonsingularity is that @xmath21 is positive definite .",
    "let @xmath22 be an open and bounded domain , and let @xmath23 be an open and bounded covering of @xmath24 satisfying some mild overlap condition among the subdomains @xmath25 , i.e. the overlap among the subdomains must be sufficient so that each interior point @xmath26 is located in the interior of at least one subdomain @xmath25 .",
    "the set @xmath27 , for @xmath26 , is uniformly bounded on @xmath24 , with @xmath28 .",
    "associated with the subdomains we choose partition of unity weight functions @xmath29 ,",
    "i.e. a family of compactly supported , nonnegative and continuous functions subordinate to the subdomain @xmath25 , such that @xmath30 on @xmath24 and @xmath31 .",
    "the global approximant is thus constructed as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 defines a local rbf interpolant on each subdomain @xmath25 and @xmath34 is a partition of unity weight function .",
    "according to @xcite , we assume to have a @xmath35-stable partition of unity , i.e a family of nonnegative functions @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , such that :    * supp@xmath38 , * @xmath39 on @xmath40 , * @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the diameter of @xmath25 and @xmath44 is a constant .    as nonnegative functions @xmath37 , we consider shepard s weight , i.e. , @xmath45 @xmath46 being compactly supported functions with support on @xmath25 such as wendland s functions @xcite .",
    "if the functions @xmath33 , @xmath47 , satisfy the interpolation conditions @xmath48 for each @xmath49 , then the global partition of unity approximant inherits the interpolation property of the local interpolants @xcite , i.e. @xmath50    in order to be able to formulate error bounds , we need some further assumptions on regularity of @xmath25 and define the _ fill distance _",
    "specifically , we require that an open and bounded covering @xmath52 is _ regular _ for @xmath53 .",
    "this means to fulfill the following properties",
    "@xcite :    1 .   for each @xmath54 ,",
    "the number of subdomains @xmath55 with @xmath56 is bounded by a global constant @xmath57 ; 2 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath58 and an angle @xmath59 such that every subdomain @xmath55 satisfies an interior cone condition with angle @xmath60 and radius @xmath61 ; 3 .",
    "the local fill distances @xmath62 are uniformly bounded by the global fill distance @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "the assumptions above lead to the requirement that the number of subdomains is proportional to the number of data @xcite .",
    "the first property ensures that is actually a sum over at most @xmath57 summands .",
    "moreover , it is crucial for an efficient evaluation of the global approximant that only a constant number of local interpolants has to be evaluated .",
    "it follows that it should be possible to locate those @xmath57 indices in constant time .",
    "the second and third properties are significant for estimating errors of rbf interpolants .",
    "[ osservaz_1 ]    after defining the space @xmath65 of all functions @xmath66 whose derivatives of order @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 for @xmath69 , we consider the following convergence result @xcite :    let @xmath70 be open and bounded and suppose that @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a strictly positive definite function .",
    "let @xmath52 be a regular covering for @xmath73 and let @xmath36 be @xmath0-stable for @xmath74 .",
    "then the error between @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the native space of @xmath77 , and its partition of unity interpolant can be bounded by : @xmath78 for all @xmath79 and all @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a constant independent of @xmath18 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "[ th1 ]    if we compare the result reported in theorem [ th1 ] with the global error estimates shown in @xcite , we can see that the partition of unity interpolant preserves the local approximation order for the global fit .",
    "thus , the partition of unity approach enables us to decompose a large problem into many small ones and , at the same time , ensures that the accuracy obtained for the local fits is carried over to the global interpolant .",
    "[ osservaz_2 ]    from theorem [ th1 ] , we can note that the interpolation error decreases together with the fill distance .",
    "anyway , consistently with the trade - off or uncertainty _ principle _ @xcite , a conflict between theoretical accuracy and numerical stability may occur .",
    "in fact , if a large number of interpolation nodes is involved , the local rbf systems may suffer from ill - conditioning .",
    "the latter is linked to the order of the basis functions and to the node distribution .",
    "therefore , the ill - conditioning grows if the fill distance decreases . in such case , in order to avoid numerical problems , for high density of interpolation points , we can use low - order basis functions or compactly supported rbfs ( csrbfs ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , several approximation techniques have been proposed to have a stable computation with flat rbfs @xcite .",
    "[ osservaz_3 ]",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of the partition of unity algorithms for bivariate and trivariate interpolation , which make use of the new block - based partitioning structure and related optimized searching procedure .",
    "they allow us to efficiently find all the points belonging to a given subdomain @xmath25 , which as in @xcite consists of circular or spherical patches ( depending on whether @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) .    here , since our main target is the interpolation of large scattered data , in the partition of unity scheme we compute the local interpolants by means of csrbfs .",
    "however , as it will be pointed out , this approach turns out to be very flexible and different choices of local approximants , either globally or compactly supported , are allowed .",
    "since we are going to describe in detail our matlab routines , in table [ mfun ] we first summarize the functions of the proposed software .    in what follows",
    "we will use a common notation for the matlab routines listed in table [ mfun ] .",
    "as example , + denotes both the routines and .",
    "moreover , for easiness of the reader , the steps of the bivariate ( @xmath84 ) and trivariate ( @xmath86 ) partition of unity method , which makes use of the block - based data structure and employs csrbfs , are shown as pseudo - code in the .",
    ".the matlab codes for the block - based partition of unity algorithms . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we present an efficient construction of the partition of unity interpolant .",
    "in fact the search of nearest points in the localized process , taking advantage of the block - based structure can be performed in a constant time .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the proposed partitioning routine is strictly related to the partition of unity subdomains , differently from other routines .",
    "extensive numerical tests and a reliable complexity analysis support our findings .    furthermore , considering some applications in geometric modeling we show the versatility of our software . moreover ,",
    "even if here we deal with convex domains , it has been pointed out that the numerical tool presented can be easily adapted , with really few changes , for working in case of non convex domains , as in @xcite . differently from such paper ,",
    "our approach excludes the employment of techniques , as for example conformal maps .",
    "in fact in that paper the schwarz - christoffel transformation is used to map the interpolant , which is built exclusively in the unit disk and not on the irregular domain , onto a known polygon . then a global method is considered and consequently the solution of the interpolation of large scattered data sets can not be achieved . on the contrary , using our technique we could get an accurate solution in case of large data sets in an irregular domain and the problem solved in a relatively small time . in that case",
    ", applications of our algorithm could arise in the context of interpolation and pdes @xcite , allowing to deal with larger data sets in a reasonable time .",
    "further investigations in this direction are needed .",
    "moreover , work in progress also consists in extending the proposed block - based partitioning scheme so that it allows to consider subdomains having variable radii .",
    "this turns out to be meaningful especially when strongly non - uniform data are considered .",
