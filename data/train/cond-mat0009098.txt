    "spin _ reflect a statistical parameter @xmath1 which is conventionally @xmath2 for bosons and whole integer spin and @xmath3 for fermions and half - integer spin",
    ". it does not seem to be generally appreciated that there are a good number of ( real and numerical ) experimental manifestations of intermediate spin in relatively simple magnet systems in a magnetic field .",
    "the principal purpose of this paper is develop a formalism for quantum tunneling of nano - magnets based upon the theory of intermediate spin .",
    "it will be show that a magnetic field directed along a suitable symmetry axis can cause , e.g. , a physical whole integer nano - magnet to have an low energy level structure which is _ identical _ to the equivalent half - integer system , this including a kramer s degeneracy .",
    "zero and a certain    -10pt    fields lying between the half - integer values correspond to whole integer points .",
    "intermediate fields correspond to intermediate spin .",
    "the suppression of the ground doublet tunnel splitting which necessarily occurs at half - integer points has been previously recognized by garg@xcite .",
    "what has been labeled `` topological quenching '' is in fact just a pseudo - kramer s degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "the implications of intermediate spin are much stronger since _ all _ low lying levels must be degenerate _ at exactly the same field_.    it is a commonplace observation , for the situation illustrated in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , that magnetic effects are periodic with period @xmath0 , the flux quantum . for",
    "the problem explained in the figure caption in particular the tunnel splitting , @xmath4 for the magnetic systems the symmetry which will be considered in most detail here is that appropriate@xcite to fe@xmath5 , fig .",
    "this corresponds to the most general    quadratic nano - magnet hamiltonian : @xmath6   \\label{deux}\\ ] ] which without loss of generality has two positive anisotropy parameters @xmath7 , see the appendix .",
    "a magnetic field is directed along the hardest , i.e. , @xmath8-direction .",
    "this is fully equivalent to the particle problem of fig .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath9 .",
    "the agreement with eqn .",
    "( [ un ] ) is illustrated by fig .",
    "the deviations from the @xmath10 behavior for larger fields is due to the finite value of @xmath11 . it is larger for the value @xmath12 relevant for fe@xmath5 .    under an adiabatic change of magnetic field by @xmath0 the @xmath13 quantum number @xmath14 for the angular momentum quantized along _ the magnetic field direction_. whatever the mixture of states with different @xmath15 , the period measured in terms of the magnetization along the field direction is automatically @xmath16 .",
    "_ however _ it is a trivial consequence of time reversal invariance that the states with fluxes @xmath17 are degenerate and so there is the possibility to construct `` schrdinger cat '' states which comprise a linear combination of states with the macroscopic field @xmath18 in both its positive and negative directions . in this case",
    "the magnetization period need no longer be @xmath19 .",
    "it will be shown , with this symmetry , such a combination exists in all energy eigenstates and that the period is indeed a fraction of @xmath19 .",
    "an even more bizarre phenomenon occur when either the field is not directed exactly along the appropriate symmetry axis and/or if the least action tunneling paths are not co - planar . for these cases",
    "the energy eigenstates correspond to suitably weighted `` schrdinger cat '' combinations with oppositely directed _ complex _ magnetic fields .",
    "the complex weighting is such that the expectation value of the physical magnetic field remains real .",
    "thus , again for the fe@xmath5 symmetry , a field @xmath20 which is perpendicular to both the hard and easy directions corresponds to a pure imaginary field @xmath21 directed along the symmetry axis , i.e. , the tunnel splitting is given by eqn .",

    "( 2b ) the resulting complex field has equal real and imaginary parts in the large @xmath11 limit , see fig .  (",
    "there are two equivalent tunneling planes which both make an angle @xmath26 with the applied field ( and @xmath27 with each other ) .",
    "the wave function for the planes is added so that there are two sets of paths , one from each plane , which are equivalent and which interfere . the resulting expression for the tunnel splitting",
    "is shown in the figure caption .",
    "as the figure illustrates this splitting increases very rapidly with field and by several orders for the @xmath11 oscillations .",
    "the last important principle is illustrated by applying a field in the hardest direction for a system with cubic symmetry , fig .",
    "this is a four fold axis and group theory insists that the lowest tunnel split multiplet comprises four states .",
    "for whole integer @xmath11 it turns out that there are two singlets and one doublet , _ however _ for a half - integer point this must reduce to two doublets , reflecting the pseudo - kramer s theorem . that this is the case for large @xmath11 is illustrated by the exact results of fig .",
    "classically for magnet such as fe@xmath5 the equilibrium    magnetization lies along its easy axis and is maximal .",
    "the existence of quantum fluctuations is reflected in the fact that the expectation value of this easy axis magnetization is @xmath28 and not @xmath29 . in the absence of a hard direction in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the easy axis , the quantum fluctuations measured by @xmath30 and @xmath31 are equal and in fact _",
    "minimal_. in the terminology used for fluctuations in quantum optics , these are minimal un - squeezed states . adding an anisotropy energy @xmath32 , which creates a hard axis in this plane as is appropriate to fe@xmath5 , _ squeezes _ the quantum fluctuations so that @xmath33 but leaves minimal states .",
    "the present approach thereby lends itself to a natural definition of squeezed spin states@xcite .",

    "adding @xmath295 brings say the @xmath296 level in the higher well into resonance with the @xmath297 of the lower well and the system again behaves as whole integer with a maximal tunnel splitting .",

    "the transverse field @xmath70 leads to a smoothly changing ( berry ) phase shift of @xmath298 in the boundary condition @xmath299 so that values of @xmath70 which are not multiples of @xmath124 correspond to an intermediate spin value .",
    "in contrast the phase shift caused by @xmath72 results from the changes in sign of the wave function for the odd @xmath208 levels , i.e. , when this field brings two levels into resonance @xmath300 which causes the effective spin value to alternate between whole and half - integer without a meaningful intermediate case .",
    "there are three regimes for which different approximate methods must be used in order to calculate the tunnel splitting .",
    "( i ) if @xmath301 , and for quantization along the easy axis , the maximal tunnel splitting @xmath220 is calculated treating @xmath32 as a perturbation , see below .",

    "the energies are @xmath305 where @xmath306 and @xmath208 is an integer@xcite .",
    "thus , e.g. , the energy between the ground state and first excited state for @xmath103 is @xmath307 , i.e. , very large and nothing to do with tunneling . as a function of field",
    "the splitting is a sawtooth .",
    "otherwise ( iii ) for @xmath308 the problem corresponds to a dominant hard axis anisotropy with again @xmath304 small .",

    "there are two cases ( a ) when the two levels in resonance @xmath208 and @xmath257 both have the same parity and ( b ) when the parity is different .",

    "this must agree with a perturbation theory in which @xmath70 can be taken to the smallest quantity . with the current axis of quantization",

    "the issue that intermediate spin effects are manifested even when there is no evident easy plane has been raised in the introduction .",

    "( 1c ) which with @xmath329 positive _ do not _ coincide with the axes .",

    "an analytic approach to the solution of this equation is facilitated by a modest field @xmath70 and large @xmath11 .",
    "this suppresses the tunneling between the state with positive and negative projections on the @xmath36-direction .",
    "now tunneling occurs between the four classical equilibrium directions with a negative @xmath34 component .",
    "it is the four least action paths between these which map to a circle . making the continuum approximation near",
    "the minimum in the the diagonal energy with a negative such projection defines a discrete simple harmonic oscillator with a potential @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the equilibrium dimensionless magnetization . in fourier space",
    "this becomes the kinetic energy and the potential @xmath335 so that there are four equivalent minima .",
    "apart from this reduction of the period by a factor of two , the problem is then fully equivalent to that considered in sec .",
    "viii and the tunnel splitting quasi - periodic as illustrated in fig .",
    "as the field increases the minimum energy directions bend towards the @xmath36-axis and this reduces the potential barrier between the equivalent wells and increases the kinetic energy , hence the steady increase in the tunnel splitting . the separation between the half - integer points when the splitting is zero",
    "is seen to be @xmath336 but varies since the coefficient of the @xmath337 kinetic energy term also increases with field .",
    "in fact there are two level crossings at small fields which occur before the large field approximation is valid and which are not visible in this figure . at least for larger fields",
    "these half - integer points really do correspond to a kramer s degenerate half - integer spectrum for the low lying quartet as is explained in the introduction and the fig .",

    "the symmetry appropriate to mn@xmath25 has an easy @xmath36-axis with equivalent @xmath8 and @xmath191 directions so that the hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath338      + h s_{x } ,      \\label{mn}\\ ] ] where , with @xmath329 positive , the @xmath8-directed transverse field is along a hard direction in the @xmath339-plane .",
    "classically in zero field there are equivalent equilibrium directions which have the magnetization parallel or anti - parallel to the @xmath36-direction .",
    "a finite @xmath70 does no alter the equivalence of these two directions , the magnetization simply gains a component opposite to the field direction",
    ". however the field _ does _ have an effect on the tunneling paths . in zero field",
    "there are four least action paths which pass via one of the easy directions in the @xmath339-plane . with a field in this particular direction and",
    "@xmath329 positive there remain only two equivalent paths which pass via an easy direction for which the magnetization has a component in the direction away from the field .",
    "it is these two least action paths which map to the intermediate spin circle . here",
    "the paths are not co - planar and the field @xmath70 will enter in the potential _ but _ without altering the symmetry .",
    "it is possible to analytically account for all four tunneling paths for large @xmath11 and not too large a @xmath70 by imagining that there are two crossed circles .",
    "a given circle comprises two easy directions in the @xmath339-plane and @xmath36-axis , i.e. , the two planes containing the circle make an angle of 45@xmath340 to the applied field .",
    "the wave function for each circle is calculated and the two are added to give the final result . because the field is at 45@xmath340 to each circle the wave vector has equal real and imaginary parts and the net result is that displayed in the caption to fig .",
    "certainly the most striking claim is that the wave function @xmath204 for an intermediate spin system is a mixture of a state with the local applied field of magnitude @xmath341 , i.e. , fields both larger and smaller than the distant applied field @xmath70 .",
    "( with an equivalent claim for @xmath71 which involves @xmath342 . )    for a particle on a ring this would imply a distortion in the near field with a range of order of the ring diameter .",
    "unfortunately the spin has no natural dimension and the ring diameter must be scaled to zero .",
    "_ experimentally _ the existence of this superposition is easy to establish . in the absence of the superposition",
    "the wave function would have a simple floquet form : @xmath343 , where @xmath344 is determined , modulo unity , from the experimental tunnel splitting : @xmath345 .",
    "theory gives @xmath346 which agrees with experiment@xcite for fe@xmath68 .",
    "following the fourier transform to @xmath15-space the factor @xmath347 corresponds to a displacement of @xmath209 and would lead to a dimensionless magnetic moment , @xmath348 again modulo unity . in the limit of large @xmath11",
    "the theory accounting for the superposition leads to @xmath349 which is smaller except when @xmath303 .",
    "this has yet to be verified experimentally .    a more subtle way of stating the same principle goes as follows : the transverse field @xmath70 couples to the physical @xmath34 , i.e. , this operator in the non - singular gauge , and which has a spectrum with a period @xmath350 or in units of magnetic moment @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the g - factor .",
    "thus if @xmath353 is the measured moment in the direction of the transverse field , @xmath354 , the dimensionless magnetization , has a natural period of unity , a statement equivalent to the observation that physical effects are periodic in the flux quantum @xmath0",
    ". this would be the case if the state did not consist _ precisely _ of a superposition of field directions .",
    "because of the admixture , the measurable period is reduced to @xmath355 as illustrated with exact results in fig .  ( 11 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath250 given above is not very accurate almost uniquely because dimensionless magnetization @xmath356 for any reasonable @xmath11 because of admixture into excited states .",
    "for example with @xmath357 and @xmath12 it was found that @xmath358 was indistinguishable from the numerical data for @xmath15 in the range @xmath359 and gave with five figure precision the numerical @xmath250 .",
    "( notice @xmath360 while @xmath361 . )",
    "it is also possible to argue for the local field @xmath362 in terms of the two level model . for an integer spin system for the ground state with @xmath363",
    "this is @xmath364 where , as above , @xmath365 is the tunnel splitting . for half - integer spin , following kramer s theorem this slitting is absent .",
    "however since the transverse field breaks time reversal symmetry it should create a splitting .",
    "the only satisfactory fashion of introducing this transverse zeeman effect without introducing a new parameter is to write @xmath366 , where @xmath15 is the dimensionless magnetic moment in the @xmath8-direction . since @xmath367",
    "this gives a splitting @xmath368 .",
    "_ however _ from eqn .",
    "( [ quatorze ] ) this is correct _ only _ if @xmath70 is replaced by the local applied field @xmath369 to give a splitting @xmath370 .",
    "the field @xmath71 similarly generates a term @xmath371 .",
    "clearly this model it is subject to experimental verification and nicely illustrates the effects of squeezing via the different factors involved with the different components of the transverse field .",
    "the lack of symmetry between the @xmath8 and @xmath191-directions reflects spin _",
    "squeezing_. for equal transverse fields @xmath372 , the degree of squeezing .",
    "more directly , e.g. , @xmath373 is given by summing the intensity of all transitions measured by the longitudinal response to an r.f .",
    "field in the @xmath8-direction . as explained above",
    ", the transverse matrix elements within the ground doublet are @xmath374 , i.e. , extremely small .",
    "it follows that the transitions with energy @xmath375 exhausts this sum rule .",
    "experimentally neutron scattering which can measure the same correlation function in zero static field would seem most appropriate .",
    "given that @xmath376 is the dominant anisotropy energy it would seem the most logical to use this easy axis for the quantization , however much of the physics of the problem corresponds to the fact that term proportional to @xmath32 creates an easy plane .",
    "it is therefore useful to re - write @xmath104 quantized along the hard axis . to this end ,",
    "first use @xmath377 whence , @xmath378 then interchanging the @xmath8 and @xmath36 axes results in @xmath379 where the constant has been omitted and the fields re - introduced .",
    "the case when @xmath380 can be transformed to @xmath381 where @xmath382 and @xmath383 . to show this , first use again @xmath384 to write : @xmath385 with the interchange of the @xmath36 and @xmath191-axes and to within a constant : @xmath386 comparing this with @xmath387 it is seen that , @xmath388 reduces the second to the first version .",
    "these manipulations leave the term @xmath389 unchanged .",
    "hence it must be , in particular , that the result for the period @xmath390 be invariant under the transformation @xmath391 then if @xmath392 it follows that @xmath393 while @xmath394 so that for the transformed problem @xmath395 , i.e. , only that case when @xmath396 need be considered .      for a review ,",
