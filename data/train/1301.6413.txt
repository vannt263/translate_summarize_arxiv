    "data obtained from a physical system sometimes possess many characteristic length and time scales . in such cases , it is desirable to construct models that are effective for large - scale structures , whilst capturing small scales at the same time . modeling this type of data via diffusion type models may be well - suited in many cases .",
    "thus , multiscale diffusion models have been used to describe the behavior of physical phenomena in scientific areas such as chemistry and biology @xcite , ocean - atmosphere sciences @xcite , finance and econometrics @xcite . in many of these problems ,",
    "the noise is taken to be small because one may , for example , be interested in modeling ( a ) : rare transition events between equilibrium states of a rough energy landscape @xcite , or ( b ) : short time maturity asymptotics for fast mean reverting stochastic volatility models @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a thorough discussion on different mathematical and statistical modeling aspects of perturbations of dynamical systems by small noise .",
    "parameter estimation in multiscale models with small noise is a problem of great practical importance , due to their wide range of applications , but also of great difficulty , due to the different separating scales .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework for the estimation of unknown parameters in a multiscale diffusion model with vanishing noise .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath0 be given and consider the @xmath1-dimensional process @xmath2 satisfying the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath3",
    "dt+\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\sigma\\left (   x_{t}^{\\epsilon},\\frac{x_{t}^{\\epsilon}}{\\delta}\\right ) dw_{t},\\hspace{0.2cm}x_{0}^{\\epsilon}=x_{0 } , \\label{eq : ldpanda1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 as @xmath5 , @xmath6 is an unknown parameter and @xmath7 is a standard @xmath1-dimensional wiener process . the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are assumed to be smooth , in the sense of condition [ a : assumption1 ] , and periodic with period @xmath10 in every direction with respect to the second variable .",
    "the rate of convergence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 to zero determines the type of equation that one obtains in the limit .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 is of order 1 as @xmath12 goes to zero , then equation ( [ eq : ldpanda1 ] ) reduces to a deterministic ode that we obtain if we set @xmath12 equal to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath12 is of order 1 as @xmath11 goes to zero , then homogenization occurs and this results to an equation with homogenized coefficients .",
    "when both parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 go to zero together , then we need to consider three different regimes depending on how fast @xmath12 goes to zero relative to @xmath11 : @xmath13    we mention here that asymptotic problems for models like ( [ eq : ldpanda1 ] ) have a long history in the mathematical literature .",
    "we refer the interested reader to classical manuscripts such as @xcite for averaging and homogenization results and to the more recent articles @xcite for large deviations results and @xcite for importance sampling results on related rare event estimation problems .",
    "in ( [ eq : ldpanda1 ] ) we assume that the drift term , through the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , depends on a physical parameter @xmath16 . generally , from a statistical inference point of view , the main questions of interest are the following :    1 .",
    "how can one estimate the fast oscillating parameter @xmath11 and the intensity of the noise @xmath12 ?",
    "2 .   how can one estimate the unknown parameter @xmath17    the first question is undoubtedly a quite difficult one and is not addressed in the current work ; see @xcite for some related results for specific equations and further references .",
    "instead , we focus on the second question . thus , assuming that the regime of interaction between @xmath12 and @xmath11 is known , we want to estimate the unknown parameter @xmath16 at time @xmath18 , based on the continuously observed process @xmath19 up to this time .    in order to do so",
    ", we will follow the maximum likelihood method .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation in multiscale diffusions with noise of order @xmath20 has been studied by different authors and under different settings , see for example @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to the manuscripts @xcite for general results on statistical estimation for diffusion processes .",
    "the novelty of the present paper stems from the fact that we address the problem of parameter estimation when both multiscale effects and small noise are present , for all three regimes in ( [ def : threepossibleregimes ] ) , which requires a different approach for the construction of maximum likelihood estimators .    indeed , in @xcite , assuming that the noise is of order @xmath20 , the authors fit the data from the prelimit process to the log - likelihood function of the limiting process , i.e. , of the process to which @xmath21 converges to , as @xmath22 .",
    "however , when the diffusion coefficient vanishes in the limit , the limiting process is no longer the solution of an sde , but of an ode ( see theorem [ t : lln ] ) , thus it is deterministic and does not have a well defined likelihood .",
    "therefore , instead of working with the likelihood function of the limiting process , we work with the log - likelihood of the original multiscale model and we infer consistency and asymptotic normality ( under conditions as described below ) by studying its limit .    in particular , under regime 1 with @xmath23 and under regimes @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see ( [ def : threepossibleregimes ] ) ) , we prove that the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) is consistent and asymptotically normal under broad conditions .",
    "the situation of regime @xmath26 with @xmath27 is more complicated , because the original log - likelihood function does not have a well defined limit as @xmath28 , due to the @xmath29 terms .",
    "we address this issue by introducing a modified ( pseudo ) log - likelihood which is well defined in the limit .",
    "it turns out that the resulting pseudo mle is not consistent , however its `` bias '' can be computed exactly .",
    "this is a known problem in multiscale parameter estimation problems @xcite ; see section [ s : mle ] for some more details on this .    in this article , by `` bias '' we mean the remainder term when we compute the limit of the estimator in probability , that is @xmath30 .",
    "the reason why we use quotes is because bias is usually defined as the remainder of the @xmath31-limit of the estimator .    under regime 1 with @xmath27",
    ", we support our findings with a simulation study for a small noise diffusion in a two - scale potential field , a model of interest in the physical chemistry literature , @xcite . for this particular model",
    ", we can construct an estimator that is consistent and normal .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s :",
    "prelim ] , we establish the necessary notation and we present the main ingredients and assumptions needed in the sequel . in section [ s : mle ] we discuss the maximum likelihood estimation problem for all three regimes . for regimes 2 and 3 and",
    "regime 1 when @xmath23 , we prove the consistency of the mle , studying the limit of the log - likelihood function , in section [ s : limitnglikelihood ] , whereas we prove a central limit theorem for the mle in section [ s : clt ] .",
    "finally , in section [ s : examples ] we study a particularly interesting case for regime @xmath26 , when @xmath27 ; a small noise diffusion in a two - scale potential field , we prove a central limit theorem for the pseudo mle in this particular setup and we present a simulated study illustrating the theoretical findings .",
    "we work with the canonical filtered probability space @xmath32 equipped with a filtration @xmath33 that satisfies the usual conditions , namely , @xmath33 is right continuous and @xmath34 contains all @xmath35-negligible sets .    regarding the sde ( [ eq : ldpanda1 ] ) we impose the following condition .

    "we additionally assume that they are @xmath39 in @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xmath42 with all partial derivatives continuous and globally bounded in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "based on the results in @xcite , we obtain the following theorem , which essentially is the law of large numbers for ( [ eq : ldpanda1 ] ) . given the results in @xcite , the additional steps required in order to prove this theorem are minimal ,",
