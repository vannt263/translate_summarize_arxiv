    "the recent observation of a new boson with a mass of about 125  gev at the lhc  @xcite brought us a lot of excitement .",
    "while this discovery is a great triumph for theoretical and experimental high energy physics , the detailed study of the new state will require many years of work at the lhc as well as at the ilc .",
    "the study includes the determination of its spin and parity quantum numbers and the coupling strength for the interactions , which can tell us if the observed resonance is indeed responsible for the brout - englert - higgs mechanism  @xcite , or involves physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "we introduce a complete framework , based on an effective filed theory approach , that allows one to perform characterisation studies of the recently - discovered boson .",
    "our assumptions are simply that the resonance structure observed in data corresponds to one bosonic state ( @xmath0 with @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , and a mass of about @xmath7 gev ) , and that no other new state below the cutoff @xmath8 coupled to such a resonance exists .",
    "we also follow the principle that any new physics is dominantly described by the lowest dimensional operators .",
    "this means , for example , that for the spin-0 @xmath9-even case ( which corresponds to the sm scalar ) we include all effects coming from the complete set of dimension - six operators relevant to higgs observables .",
    "given that our goal is that of providing a simulation framework in terms of mass eigenstates , and consistently with the general guidelines outlined above , we construct an effective lagrangian below the ewsb scale , where @xmath10 reduces to @xmath11 ; moreover , we do not require @xmath9 conservation , and we leave open the possibility that the new boson might be a scalar with no definite @xmath9 properties .",
    "technically , the implementation of the lagrangian is performed in feynrules  @xcite extending and completing the earlier version used in ref .",
    "@xcite . the particle content and the feynman rules of the model can be exported to any matrix element generator in the ufo format  @xcite .",
    "we dub it _",
    "higgs characterisation model _",
    "@xcite and it can be found on the feynrules on - line database at http://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be .",
    "there are several advantages in having a first principle implementation in terms of an effective lagrangian which can be automatically interfaced to a matrix element generator ( and then to an event generator ) .",
    "first and most important , all relevant production and decay modes can be studied within the same model , from gluon fusion to vbf as well as @xmath12 and @xmath13 associated productions can be considered and the corresponding processes automatically generated within minutes .",
    "second , it is straightforward to modify the model implementation to extend it further in case of need , by adding further interactions , for example of higher - dimensions .",
    "finally , higher - order qcd effects can be easily accounted for by multi - parton tree - level or full nlo computations and their matching with parton showers in automatic frameworks , e.g. with madgraph5  @xcite or amc@nlo  @xcite .    in this report",
    "we first write down the effective lagrangian explicitly , and then show mass and angular distributions in the @xmath14 process , comparing with the results by the jhu program  @xcite which takes the anomalous coupling framework and is employed by both atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for all the detailed demonstration and analyses .",
    "the construction of the effective lagrangian for the spin-0 state is obtained by requiring that the parametrisation : i ) allows one to recover the sm case easily ; ii ) includes all possible interactions that are generated by gauge - invariant dimension - six operators above the ew scale ; iii ) includes @xmath2 state couplings typical of susy or of generic two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) ; and iv ) allows @xmath9-mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath2 states ( which we parametrise in terms of an angle @xmath16 ) .",
    "let us start with the interaction lagrangian relevant to fermions which , while being extremely simple , illustrates our philosophy well .",
    "such a lagrangian is : @xmath17 where we use the notation @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and denote by @xmath20 @xmath21 the strength of the scalar ( pseudoscalar ) coupling in the sm ( in a 2hdm with @xmath22 ) .",
    "we point out that the constants @xmath23 can be taken real without any loss of generality . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that only the third - generation of fermions couple to the scalar state ; extensions to the other families and flavour - changing structures are trivial to implement , which can be directly done by users of feynrules .",
    "the interaction of eq .",
    "( [ eq:0ff ] ) can also parametrise the effects of a @xmath24 operator , which modifies the value of the yukawa coupling , but not the interaction structure .",
    "note also that all requirements listed above are satisfied at the price of a small redundancy in the number of parameters .",
    "the sm is obtained when @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the pseudoscalar state of a type - ii @xmath9-conserving 2hdm or susy is obtained by setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 or @xmath29 for up or down components of the @xmath30 fermion doublet , respectively .",
    "the parametrisation of @xmath9 mixing is entirely realised in terms of the angle @xmath16 , i.e. independently of the parameters @xmath23 , so that many interesting cases , such as again @xmath9-violation in generic 2hdm , can be covered .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the interaction of scalar and pseudoscalar states with vector bosons can be written as follows : @xmath31 { \\nonumber}\\\\    & -\\frac{1}{4}\\big[c_{\\alpha}\\kappa_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}h\\gamma\\gamma }   g_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}h\\gamma\\gamma } \\",

    "the parametrisation of the couplings to vectors follows the same principles as that of the couplings to fermions .",
    "in particular , the mixing angle @xmath16 allows for a completely general description of @xmath9-mixed states .",
    "we stress here that while in general in a given model @xmath9 violation depends on the whole set of possible interactions among the physical states and can not be established by looking only at a sub sector  @xcite , in our parametrisation @xmath34 or @xmath35 ( and non - vanishing @xmath36 ) implies @xmath9 violation .",
    "this can be easily understood by first noting that in eq .",
    "( [ eq:0ff ] ) @xmath37 or @xmath35 always leads to @xmath9 violation and that the corresponding terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:0vv ] ) are generated via a fermion loop by the @xmath38 interaction .",
    "the @xmath9-odd analogues of the operators in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq:0vv ] ) do vanish .    in our implementation",
    ", the parameters listed in table  [ tab : param ] can be directly set by the user .",
    "the dimensionful couplings @xmath39 are set so as to reproduce a sm higgs and a pseudoscalar one in a 2hdm with @xmath22 , e.g. @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the heavy top loop limit .",
