    "in recent years running coupling corrections have been calculated for a variety of small-@xmath0 observables .",
    "the running coupling corrections for the linear balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation @xcite were found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , while the corrections for the non - linear balitsky  kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite and jalilian - marian  iancu  mclerran  weigert  leonidov  kovner ( jimwlk ) @xcite evolution equations were found in @xcite .",
    "the question of the running coupling scale in gluon production was first addressed in @xcite , with the corrections to the lowest - order gluon production cross section calculated in @xcite .",
    "calculations of running coupling corrections for these small-@xmath0 observables serve two related purposes .",
    "one is to answer the theoretical question about how running coupling effects enter small-@xmath0 evolution and particle production .",
    "the other reason for calculating running coupling corrections is phenomenological : it is known that running coupling effects reduce the effective value of the bfkl pomeron intercept @xcite as compared to the fixed - coupling results , leading to a slower growth with energy of cross sections and structure functions , which is more in line with the experimental data .",
    "this feature resulted in a very successful phenomenology developed over the past few years for the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite and for heavy ion collisions @xcite based on the running coupling bk ( rcbk ) equation .",
    "the existing phenomenological applications of the running coupling evolution to dis mainly concentrate on the total dis cross section and the structure functions @xcite .",
    "a related dis process is the single diffractive dissociation , in which the proton or nuclear target remains intact in the interaction , generating an adjacent rapidity gap , with the incoming virtual photon splitting into a @xmath1 pair along with several more gluons and quarks , which later fragment into hadrons with the net invariant mass @xmath2 .",
    "the process is illustrated in .",
    "at very high energy / small-@xmath0 the cross section of single diffractive dissociation is described by the non - linear evolution equation derived in @xcite in the leading-@xmath3 and large-@xmath4 approximations with fixed coupling .",
    "the equation was generalized beyond the large-@xmath4 limit in @xcite .",
    "at the same time , until now the running coupling corrections to the equation of @xcite have not been constructed .",
    "similar to the running coupling corrections for other small-@xmath0 observables , these corrections are needed first of all on the purely theoretical grounds , to determine the scale of the running coupling constant in the kernel of the equation of @xcite .",
    "second of all , they may be useful phenomenologically to analyze single diffractive dissociation in the same framework as the total dis cross sections .",
    "( note though that since the invariant mass @xmath2 of the hadrons produced in the single diffractive dissociation at hera is not very large , in practical phenomenological applications one often limits the virtual photon breakup to the @xmath1 pair and at most one gluon @xcite , thus alleviating the need for an evolution equation .",
    "we will proceed here expecting that such approximation will require small-@xmath0 evolution corrections at the future dis machines . )",
    "the goal of this work is to find the running coupling corrections to the evolution equation for diffractive dissociation constructed in @xcite .",
    "this letter is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rederive ] we re - derive the non - linear evolution for the single diffractive dissociation at fixed - coupling using a method different from the original one used in @xcite , more similar to the one used in @xcite .",
    "this new method makes inclusion of the running coupling corrections straightforward , which is accomplished in sec .",
    "[ rc ] . our final result is shown in , which , along with the kernels and demonstrates that the running coupling corrections to the kernel of the non - linear evolution equation for diffraction are exactly the same as those for the rcbk and rcjimwlk evolution equations .",
    "we begin by re - deriving the fixed - coupling evolution equation for the single diffractive dissociation in dis originally found in @xcite . our goal is to find the cross section @xmath5 for the single diffractive dissociation in dis on a nucleus @xmath6 resulting in a rapidity gap and production of hadrons with the invariant mass @xmath2 , as shown in .",
    "we denote the net rapidity interval between the projectile @xmath1 pair and the target nucleus by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath1 dipole  nucleus system and @xmath9 is the photon virtuality .",
    "as shown in , if we assume that the nucleus has rapidity @xmath10 , then the projectile @xmath11 dipole would have rapidity @xmath12 .",
    "the rapidity gap stretches from rapidity @xmath10 to rapidity @xmath13 .",
    "assuming that @xmath14 one has @xmath15 .",
    "we are working in the kinematics when both @xmath13 and @xmath16 are very large , such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the leading - logarithmic small-@xmath0 evolution corrections resumming powers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are important .",
    "that is , we need to resum gluon emissions and virtual corrections for the gluons inside the rapidity gap and in the dissociation region of the @xmath11 pair leading to creation of hadrons with the invariant mass @xmath2 .",
