    "the surface electromagnetic waves ( sew ) on plasma surface and plasma - like media ( gaseous plasma , dielectric and conducting media , etc . ) attract special attention of researchers due to their unique properties .",
    "first of all , due to its high phase and group velocities close to light speed in vacuum at high media conductivity what makes them the most valuable in radiophysics @xcite .",
    "the sew are widely applied in physical electronics due to its high phase velocity leading to its uncomplicated generation by relativistic electron bunches and output from plasma .",
    "+ below we discuss the problem of sew amplification with the help of electron bunch running over flat plasma surface .",
    "we consider the case of ultrarelativistic monoenergetic electron bunch which remains relativistic in the frame of reference of sew generated by this bunch compared to the works @xcite , where the bunches were nonrelativistic .",
    "such a problem of generation of three - dimensional electromagnetic wave ( wakefields ) in plasma with the help of ultrarelativistic electron and ion bunches through cherenkov resonance radiation was solved in @xcite , where it was shown that bunch ultrarelativity influences significantly the nonlinear stage of plasma - bunch interaction , in particular , the saturation amplitude of the generated wave . + in the present work we apply the method developed in @xcite for the case of amplification of a surface electromagnetic wave by means of ultrarelativistic monoenergetic electron bunch running over the flat plasma surface .",
    "the interest to the sew amplification was aroused by its uncomplicated output from plasma compared to that of the three - dimensional wave generated by the bunch as well and high magnitudes of sew energy density .",
    "the latter is related to the field structure .",
    "thus , as it ll be shown below , the sew saturation energy density can exceed the bunch energy density .",
    "+ it is noteworthy that the real sew amplification device should be cylindrical what we do comprehend very well .",
    "however , the problem taking into account the cylindrical geometry is much more complex compared to that of plane geometry from the mathematical point of view and is not appropriate for illustrative purposes .",
    "this is why we restrict ourselves to the plane geometry problem .",
    "soon , we are planning to finish an article considering the real cylindrical sew bunch - plasma amplifier and will present it for publication .",

    "the bunch electrons get trapped by the sew , i.e. there will be no relative motion between the bunch electrons and the sew , thus , no energy exchange between the bunch and sew occurs , the bunch and the sew become stationary . for determination of the saturation amplitude of the potential of the plasma sew , generated by the bunch and amplified with the time with the increment @xmath52 , we will apply the same method used in @xcite .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) . at the same time , the transverse fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 are much higher than the longitudinal fields .",
    "this is why we restrict ourselves to calculation of the transverse fields in the vacuum domain , also because these components form the much higher longitudinal radiating component of poynting vector ( energy density flux ) compared to the transverse one .",
    "@xmath64 it is quite easy to calculate the fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the plasma domain from eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) .",

    "the transverse sew is generated and its behaviour is not trivial .",
    "the only thing we can say is that the fields ( [ 20 ] ) are determined from condition of the bunch electrons trapping in the wave field and that they are lower than those obtained from sew front breakdown threshold .",

    "this is due to the fields structure , i. e. @xmath71 .",
    "the point is that the bunch gets trapped by sew weak longitudinal field component @xmath72 , whereas the bunch energy is transfered to the whole sew , i.e. the transverse components @xmath62 and @xmath63 get amplified as well forming the longitudinal energy density flux . as a result ,",
    "the sew saturation energy density becomes considerably higher than the corresponding bunch energy density .",
