    "<S> typically , cosmological phase transitions occur when a gauge symmetry of a particle physics theory is spontaneously broken . in that case , the cores of the topological defects formed are regions in which the symmetry of the unbroken theory is restored . </S>",

    "<S> topological defects , arising according to the kibble mechanism @xcite when @xmath2 breaks down to @xmath3 , are classified in terms of the homotopy groups of the vacuum manifold @xmath4 @xcite . the relevant homotopy groups are @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is nontrivial , topological defects can form . for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the defects are domain walls , cosmic strings and monopoles respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we are typically interested in a scenario where @xmath3 breaks further to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 is nontrivial , defects are possible in this second stage of symmetry breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath6 and @xmath10 ( for some @xmath11 ) are both nontrivial , the defect formed in the first stage persists in the second stage . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , @xmath10 is trivial , then the corresponding defect does not exist in the second stage . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the defects formed in the breaking of @xmath2 to @xmath3 must be unstable when @xmath3 breaks to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> cosmic strings can explain large scale structure , anisotropies in cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , and part of the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> global monopoles can explain structure formation in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> domain walls and local monopoles , on the other hand , if they exist , are potentially problematic </S>",
    "<S> . they would dominate the energy density of the universe and overclose it @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem of monopoles is especially serious since it is generic to grand unification scenarios @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the popular solution based on the idea of inflation can not be implemented in the minimal grand unified theories ( guts ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , to solve the domain wall problem @xcite , we require inflation to take place after the phase transition that causes the production of these defects . </S>",
    "<S> this is difficult to achieve in general .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a possible solution of the monopole problem was suggested @xcite , based on the possibility that unstable domain walls sweep away the monopoles . the idea of symmetry nonrestoration at high temperature @xmath12 @xcite provides a simple way out of the domain wall problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in case of the monopole problem , the situation is far from clear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in a recent paper , bajic et al @xcite show that the monopole problem in grand unified theories as well as the domain wall problem may be easily solved if the lepton number asymmetry in the universe is large enough . in spite of the fact that domain walls are undesirable objects , during their decay they can provide a departure from thermal equilibrium which is one of the conditions for baryogenesis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , several unification schemes are being investigated in detail , specially for their signatures in the planned particle accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> some of the unification schemes have interesting consequences for cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> a rich variety of cosmic string solutions was demonstrated @xcite in the context of @xmath13 unification and has received fresh attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as the non - viability of several models for electroweak baryogenesis is becoming apparent @xcite , it is interesting to search for new mechanisms for low - energy baryogenesis in other unified models @xcite .    as a particle physics model </S>",
    "<S> , we consider one of the most attractive extensions of the standard electroweak model , based on the gauge group @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various models employing this gauge group are possible , depending on which higgs and fermion spectrum is chosen , and whether or not exact discrete left - right symmetry is imposed . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the class of left - right symmetric models described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides explaining the observed parity violation of weak interactions at low energies , these models also provide an explanation for the lightness of ordinary neutrinos , via the see - saw mechanism .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the minimal left - right symmetric model for the presence of topological defect solutions . we begin with the phase in which only the first stage of symmetry breaking @xmath15 has occurred . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cosmic string solution exists in the high temperature phase of the theory where the electroweak symmetry is restored . </S>",
    "<S> these string defects may either be destabilized at the electroweak phase transition or may acquire additional condensates and continue to enjoy topological stability . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the strings possess zero - energy modes of the right handed neutrino , and below the electroweak scale , also those of the left handed neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> the model also admits at least two kind of domain wall solutions which are stable only above the electroweak scale .    in sec . </S>",
    "<S> ii , we describe the minimal left - right symmetric model . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> iii , we discuss the possibility of producing cosmic strings and associated zero modes . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> iv , we discuss the domain wall solutions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , sec . </S>",
    "<S> v contains the conclusions and the cosmological consequences of the defects .    * </S>",
    "<S> ii . left - right symmetric model we consider the minimal @xmath14 model with a discrete left - right symmetry </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . this model is formulated so that parity is a spontaneously broken symmetry : the lagrangian is left - right symmetric but the vacuum is not invariant under the parity transformation . </S>",
    "<S> thus the observed v - a structure of the weak interactions is only a low energy phenomenon , which should disappear when one reaches energies of order @xmath16 , where @xmath16 is the vacuum expectation value of one of the higgs fields .    </S>",
    "<S> according to left - right symmetric requirement , quarks ( @xmath17 ) and leptons ( @xmath18)are placed in left and right doublets , q_l = _ l ,    q_r = _ r , + [ 0.3 cm ] _ </S>",
    "<S> l = _ l ,    _ r = _ r    , where the representation content with respect to the gauge group is explicitly given . since the weak interactions observed at low energies involve only the left handed helicity components , the electric charge formula can be written in a left - right symmetric form as q = t^3_l + t^3_r +   , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the weak isospin represented by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pauli matrix . regarding the bosons , gauge vector bosons consist of two tripltes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and a singlet @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the higgs sector of the model is dictated by two requirements , the choice of the symmetry breaking term and the desire to reproduce the phenomenologically observed light masses of the known neutrinos via the see - saw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> then the unique minimal set is @xmath26 where the scalar fields have been written in a convenient representation using @xmath27 matrices .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy of the higgs fields can not have trilinear terms , this can be seen as follows . </S>",
    "<S> since the triplets @xmath28 and @xmath29 have nonzero @xmath30 , these must always appear in the quadratic combinations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> these can never be combined with a single bidoublet @xmath35 in such a way as to form @xmath36 and @xmath0 singlets . </S>",
    "<S> however , quartic combinations of the form @xmath37 are in general allowed by the left - right symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> according to these strict conditions , the most general form of the higgs potential is ( see @xcite ) v = v_+ v_+ v _   , [ potential ] with v_= -_i , j ^2_ij tr ( _ i _ j ) & + & _ i , j , k , l _ </S>",
    "<S> ijkl tr(_i _ j ) tr(_k _ l ) + [ 0.3 cm ] & + & _ i , j , k , l ^_ijkl tr(_i _ j _ k _ l )   . </S>",
    "<S> [ vphi ] v_= & - & ^2 tr(+ ) + _ 1 + [ 0.3 cm ] & + & _ 2 + _ 3 + [ 0.3 cm ] & + & _ 4   . </S>",
    "<S> [ vdelta ] v _ & = & _ i , j _ </S>",
    "<S> ij tr(_i _ j ) tr(+ ) + [ 0.3 cm ] & + & _ i , j _ </S>",
    "<S> ij tr + [ 0.3 cm ] & + & _ i , j   . </S>",
    "<S> [ vdeltaphi ] note that , as a consequence of the discrete left - right symmetry , all terms in the potential are self - conjugate , except for @xmath38 ; therefore @xmath38 is the only parameter which may be complex . since we will not discuss the cp violation aspect of the generation of baryon asymmetry , we assume @xmath38 to be real . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown @xcite that , without fine tuning , @xmath39 terms spoil the seesaw mechanism by inducing a direct majorana mass term for the left - handed neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we set @xmath40 in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this choice will also avoid the unwanted presence of large flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , only the neutral components of the scalar fields , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , can acquire vacuum values ( vevs ) without violating electric charge . if @xmath28 or @xmath29 acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , then @xmath30 is necessarily broken , and if @xmath45 , parity breakdown is also ensured . </S>",
    "<S> thus the following vevs are sufficient for achieving the correct pattern of symmetry breaking = ,   _ l , r =  , [ vevs ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath16 are taken to be real , and phenomenologically the hierarchy @xmath49 , @xmath50 is required .    </S>",
    "<S> fermion masses are obtained from yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons with the higgs bosons . for one generation of quarks @xmath17 and leptons @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the couplings are given by @xcite @xmath51 the majorana mass terms allowed for the neutrinos are a source of lepton number violation as well as cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings are also important for studying fermionic zero - modes of cosmic strings .    </S>",
    "<S> * iii . </S>",
    "<S> cosmic strings and fermion zero - modes    in this section we discuss the cosmic string sectors occurring in this theory . in the following we use the notation @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> consider first a pure @xmath53 theory with a two real triplet scalars which break the symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> a cosmic string sector exists in this breakdown because the stability group of the vev is @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath54 arises because the @xmath53 element @xmath55 , negative of the identity , leaves invariant the vev of the triplets @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider next the breakdown of @xmath56 due to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field @xmath29 is complex and can be parametrized as _ </S>",
    "<S> r = ( r + i s ) .  , [ deltaparam ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are 3-dimensional real vectors and @xmath59 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the vev for @xmath29 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vevs ] ) implies that @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in the usual 3-dimensional basis . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 alone were present , a cosmic string sector would exist in this breakdown as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the inclusion of @xmath62 does not change this conclusion . to show this , </S>",
    "<S> suppose the cosmic string ansatz is set up as usual by a path in @xmath0 connecting @xmath63 to @xmath55 by @xmath64 rotation generated by a broken generator . </S>",
    "<S> we may try to unwind this using the surviving gauge symmetry @xmath65 . but </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath64 rotation generated by @xmath66 also leads to a @xmath64 winding in the @xmath62 space . </S>",
    "<S> thus the unshrinkable path persists . </S>",
    "<S> this reasoning also shows that the @xmath67 expected from the breakdown of @xmath62 group by itself does not persist due to the presence of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> rotation by the unbroken generator @xmath68 identifies distinct sectors labelled by @xmath67 modulo the @xmath54 which survives the @xmath0 breakdown @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider next , the breakdown of the model to electromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> if the only additional field were @xmath28 , the residual symmetry would be @xmath69 by a simple extension of the previous arguments . specifically , the @xmath69 elements are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 in an obvious notation . however , the vev of the bidoublet @xmath35 ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vevs ] ) ) is invariant only under @xmath70 , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath54 consisting of these two elements is therefore a discrete symmetry of the low temperature theory . in the following we set up ansatze for the cosmic strings both in the high temperature and low temperature phases exploiting the @xmath54 relevant to each phase .    </S>",
    "<S> let an infinite long string be oriented along the @xmath74 axis and let @xmath75 be the angle in the @xmath76-@xmath77 plane . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a map @xmath78 from the infinitely large circle , @xmath79 , in the @xmath76-@xmath77 plane into some one - parameter @xmath80 subgroup of the parent group generated by a broken generator @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> consider first the high temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the diagonal generators of the parent group and @xmath68 is preserved , the orthogonal combination @xmath83 is a good choice for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> consider the general map given by u^(;p ) = e^ip y = e^-ip x  , [ uinfp ] where @xmath84 is a real parameter to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> the notation @xmath85 is to keep distinct the @xmath62 which is multiplicative from the @xmath0 whose action is adjoint . since @xmath0 acts on @xmath29 by similarity transformation , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting general scalar field ansatz is _ </S>",
    "<S> r(,;p)=  .[deltarp ] the minimal value of @xmath86 required to make the ansatz single - valued is @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that both the values @xmath88 of @xmath84 belong to the same topological sector . for @xmath89 , a rotation by @xmath90 generated by @xmath68 deforms the path to be the entirely in @xmath0 , connecting @xmath63 to @xmath55 . for @xmath91 , the same is done by a @xmath68 rotation by @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath93 , @xmath78 winds once around @xmath62 and is a @xmath64 rotation in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this path can be deformed by @xmath65 to be a purely @xmath94 rotation in @xmath0 and thus it is trivial . by extending this reasoning to the values @xmath95 , </S>",
    "<S> all such maps can be reduced to the trivial sector . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , all the paths with @xmath96 can be reduced either to the @xmath89 or @xmath91 path . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath89 is distinguished from @xmath91 only by the sense of winding . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to consider the ultimate fate of these domain walls . as we have shown in sec . </S>",
    "<S> iii , if only @xmath0 is broken , then a topologically unstable cosmic string may be formed with @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> since the dw has the boundary condition @xmath218 as @xmath219 , these unstable strings will be the boundary of the dw . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the cosmological netwotks of string - bounded walls has been studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the walls eventually shrink via surface tension , string intercommutation and nucleation of new string loops . </S>",
    "<S> thus they never dominate the energy density of the universe , and can have interesting cosmological effects while they last .    </S>",
    "<S> * v. conclusions from the point of view of a predictable baryogenesis , the left - right symmetric model enjoys the advantage that the primordial value of the @xmath30 number is naturally zero , being the value of an abelian gauge charge . </S>",
    "<S> the topological defects studied here can play a significant role in baryogenesis through leptogenesis .    in the context of left - right symmetric models , mechanisms for electroweak baryogenesis that do not rely on topological defects </S>",
    "<S> have been investigated recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the parameters in the potential , for the minimal model considered here , require unnatural fine tuning to provide sufficient cp violation to expalin the observed baryon asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown recently that spontaneous cp violation can occur in the minimal left - right symmetric model considered here @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , baryogenesis with only spontaneous breakdown of cp presents severe cosmological problems , due to the formation of domain walls as a result of the breaking of a discrete symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in order to generate baryon asymmetry , the scale of the spontaneous cp violation and the scale at which the baryogenesis takes place must be different @xcite ; otherwise , an equal amount of matter and anti - matter is generated . in the minimal left - right symmetric model with spontaneous cp violation , both scales coincide and therefore electroweak baryogenesis is not feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> defect - mediated leptogenesis mechanisms also need enhanced cp violation . for the present purpose we note that the @xmath220 field @xcite does not alter the topological considerations presented above since it is a gauge singlet and its main function is to bias the potential of the field @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of @xmath220 to both @xmath28 and @xmath29 may be assumed to be identical due to left - right symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> then the domain walls present very interesting prospects . </S>",
    "<S> their interaction with other particles in the pre - electroweak scale plasma can result in leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> a model - independent possibility of this kind was considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more specific considerations also appear in @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the model is descended from a grand unified theory . for this or for some other reason </S>",
    "<S> there may be a small asymmetry between the l - preferring and r - preferring minima even above the electroweak scale . if the energy density difference is suppressed by powers of the gut mass , the walls are still expected to be present long enough to bring about requisite leptogenesis .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of exact left - right symmetry leads to domain walls that are stable above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale . in this case the regions trapped in @xmath221 vacuum </S>",
    "<S> will become suddenly destabilized as the @xmath115 acquires a vev . </S>",
    "<S> the destabilization can generate large amounts of entropy and the domains should reheat to some temperature @xmath222 greater than @xmath192 but less than @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility for baryogenesis from situations with large departure from thermal equilibrium was considered by weinberg@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that in such situations the asymmetry generated should be determined by the ratio of time constants governing baryon number violation and entropy generation respectively . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> we expect leptogenesis from the degeneration of @xmath223 due to the majorana - like yukawa coupling mentioned in sec . </S>",
    "<S> ii . the generated lepton asymmetry can then convert to baryon asymmetry through the electroweak anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility will be studied separately .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that model admits dw solutions if we impose the phenomenological hierarchy @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and avoid fine tuning in the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the fields in this case are @xmath29 and @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> domain walls are formed when @xmath29 field acquires a non - zero vev . at the electroweak scale </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath115 field acquires a vev @xmath46 and forms a condensate inside the domain wall . since these domain walls formed at the same scale as the unstable cosmic strings </S>",
    "<S> , the unstable strings will be the boundary of the dw . </S>",
    "<S> these dw solutions are unstable : they will shrink and disappear .    </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic strings demonstrated above can play several nontrivial roles in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> they can provide sites for electroweak baryogenesis as proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been proposed that the fermion zero modes they possess can result in leptogenesis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equally interesting is the process of disintegration of the unstable strings below the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the decay should proceed by appearance of gaps in the string length with formation of monopoles at the ends of the resulting segments . </S>",
    "<S> the free segments then shrink , realizing the scenario of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the left - right symmetric model considered here provides a concrete setting for all of the above scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> several new features that have been demonstrated can alter the scenarios qualitatively and merit further study . </S>"
