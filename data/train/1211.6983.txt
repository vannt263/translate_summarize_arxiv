    "the bertotti - robinson ( br ) @xcite and melvin ( ml ) @xcite solutions of einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory are well - known for a long time which had significant impacts on different aspects of general relativity . for decades they remained in fashion and found applications in connection with stellar objects , cosmology , string theory etc .",
    "a recent study discusses the similarities / differences between these spacetimes @xcite .",
    "it is shown , among other things in @xcite for instance , that the only geodesically complete static em spacetimes are the br and ml solutions .",
    "since they share  more common properties than contrasts , the natural question arises whether it is possible to describe both solutions in a common metric .",
    "this is precisely what we show in the axially symmetric ( i.e. @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 coordinates ) geometry in this paper .",
    "it should be added that large classes of em solutions found long ago by kundt @xcite and plebanski and demiahski ( pd ) @xcite both admitted separate br and ml limits in different coordinates through specific limits .",
    "we work out our solution entirely in the axially symmetric @xmath6 coordinates and express our metric in those coordinates .",
    "our solution admits the br limit but not the separate ml limit . in other words",
    "br universe forms the background of our spacetime on which ml is added . in obtaining the solution",
    "we choose the magnetic phase of br solution so that the total magnetic potential @xmath7 is expressed as a superposition , @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 the em solution constructed from @xmath7 is what we dub as the `` unified br and ml spacetime '' .",
    "the solution involves two parameters , @xmath11 ( for br charge ) and @xmath12 ( for ml charge ) .",
    "the ranges of parameters are @xmath13 and @xmath14 so that our solution does nt admit the ml limit .",
    "br spacetime is conformally flat whereas ml is cylindrically symmetric which becomes flat near the axis @xmath15 for a finite @xmath16 and @xmath17 ml is not flat . both are singularity free ; a feature that makes them attractive in cosmology and string theory .",
    "we remark also that the br solution can be obtained by a coordinate transformation @xcite from a spacetime of colliding electromagnetic waves known as bell - szekeres solution @xcite . using the ernst formalism we showed long ago that within this formalism bell - szekeres and khan - penrose @xcite solutions can be combined through a suitable seed function @xcite .",
    "also schwarzschild and br spacetimes were interpolated by the electromagnetic parameter in the oblate spheroidal coordinates 11 . within similar context superposition of spinning spheroids @xcite from harmonic seed functions in",
    "the zipoy - voorhees metric @xcite were obtained .",
    "it is remarkable that interpolation of br and ml solutions takes place in the static axial coordinates @xmath18 instead of oblate/ prolate coordinates .",
    "the latter coordinate systems are known to admit separability in the laplace equation and had much impact in the development of solution generation techniques .",
    "one of the important conclusions to be drawn in this study is that two electromagnetic fields , which separately yield regular spacetimes , namely the br and ml , may yield a singular spacetime upon their combination .",
    "physical interpretation suggests that the mutual magnetic fields focus each other strong enough to result in a singularity .",
    "the singularity at @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) does nt exhibit directional properties @xcite , that is , the kretschmann scalar diverges irrespective of the way of approach and ( @xmath22 ) is the only singularity in our solution for arbitrary parameters .",
    "an exact solution of null geodesics reveals that we have a null - geodesically incomplete manifold . beside null geodesics we study the radial motion for massless / massive particles and also the circular motion in the @xmath23 plane . from the analysis of the potential",
    "the circular motion admits stable orbits .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce magnetic fields in axial symmetry , solve the equations and derive the metric of unified br and ml spacetimes .",
    "geodesic equation and its solutions are investigated in sec .",
    "the paper ends with conclusion in sec .",
    "to review the basics of an axially symmetric spacetime we start with the line element @xmath24\\]]in which @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 are functions of @xmath16 and @xmath28 alone .",
    "the em field equations can be derived from a variational principle of the action@xmath29where @xmath30 .\\]]here",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 denotes partial derivative of a function @xmath34 with respect to @xmath16 @xmath32 @xmath28 and @xmath35 is a magnetic potential . upon variation",
    "the metric function @xmath27 is fixed as @xmath36 , while the two basic equations take the forms @xmath37@xmath38the @xmath26 function is determined more appropriately by the set@xmath39@xmath40whose integrability condition is satisfied by virtue of the field equations .",
    "the magnetic vector potential is chosen simply by@xmath41for a function @xmath42 which is related to @xmath35 above through @xmath43@xmath44the dual of the field tensor @xmath45 implies the absence of any electric components which is our choice here . in @xcite br and ml",
    "solutions are summarized in details so that we can only record them in what follows :        @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    note that the more familiar @xmath49 version of br spacetime is given upon the transformation@xmath50@xmath51by @xmath52      @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55      we proceed now to combine the foregoing solutions . for this purpose",
    "we take the magnetic potential as the superposition of the two foregoing , namely @xmath56where @xmath12 and @xmath11 are the constants of ml and br solutions which are restricted by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "to get an idea about this superposition we resort to the axial gauge @xmath59  in flat space@xmath60let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be two magnetic potentials where both solve the maxwell equations @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) with @xmath65 it can be checked easily that their superposition @xmath66 solves the superposed maxwell equation @xmath67 = 0.$ ] upon this observation we seek an analogous behavior in the curved spacetime and we find out that indeed it works with some difference .",
    "integration of the field equations from eq .",
    "( 4 ) to eq . ( 7 ) yields the following results@xmath68@xmath69where the function @xmath70 is given by@xmath71 .\\]]it is observed easily that setting @xmath72 recovers the br solution with a charge @xmath11 .",
    "however , the limit @xmath73 does not exist , which means that although in flat spacetime our electromagnetic field is a superposition of br and ml potentials , in curved spacetime the solution gives only the br limit correctly .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath74parametric pd class of em solutions @xcite which admits electromagnetic fields even in the flat space limit . in our case existence of the br",
    "is essential while ml limit ca nt be interpolated .",
    "let us add also that the metric functions of pd are expressed in its most generality in quartic polynomial forms whereas our solution involves decimal powers as well .",
    "these distinctive properties suggest that our solution is not included in the general class of pd .",
    "the two are expressed in different coordinates / symmetries so that transition between the two for arbitrary cases",
    "ca nt be expressed in closed forms .",
    "more specifically , the type - d metric of pd class that yields separately the ml and br limits are as follows : i)@xmath75letting @xmath76 @xmath77 ( @xmath78constant ) , @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and an overall scaling gives the ml metric . ii)@xmath82letting @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 gives the br metric in axial symmetry with a unit charge .",
    "it remains to be seen , however that ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) follow from the pd class of solutions in the same coordinate patch i.e. without further transformations in the ( @xmath87 ) coordinates .",
    "furthermore it is worthful to look at the form of invariants of the spacetime .",

    "this is the indication that our particular solution does nt yield a null - geodesically complete spacetime .",
    "the br and ml spacetimes are known both to be geodesically complete whereas our particular example provides a case of their combination which is at least null  geodesically incomplete .",
    "this can be observed by resorting to the solution ( 46 ) to obtain ( let us choose @xmath145 for simplicity)@xmath146where @xmath147 is the affine parameter for null geodesics .",

    "2 we plot @xmath16 versus @xmath125 ( a ) and @xmath173 ( b ) .",
    "it is very much clear that the motion is periodic which means that the particle is attracted by the origin and while approaches the origin it gains energy and this energy causes to pass the origin and in the other direction slows down to rest and in the same way repeats the motion",

    "we find@xmath245this brief analysis of kundt s null geodesics recovers the equivalent results of the previous analysis .",
    "namely , that the exact integrals of geodesics in a section of the ( @xmath246 ) plane does nt cover the whole plane .",
    "we conclude therefore that null geodesic incompleteness remains intact irrespective of the representation of the metric .",
    "being inspired by the superposed solutions in colliding wave spacetimes which unfortunately received no attentions we show here in a similar manner that br and ml spacetimes can be combined in a single metric .",
    "the distinction between the two problems , i.e. colliding waves and axial symmetry , is that in the latter case superposition worked in the more familiar cylindrical @xmath18 coordinates rather than the prolate / oblate ones .",
    "the obtained metric inherits the imprints of both solutions .",
    "it is not conformally flat for instance , and regularity at the origin i.e. at @xmath247 holds provided in @xmath248 for an arbitrary ml parameter , however , our solution becomes singular on the symmetry axis . due to the fractional powers of @xmath16",
    "our solution is neither smooth nor flat on the symmetry axis .",
    "exact solution of geodesics reveals that null geodesics in the singular manifold are not complete whereas br and ml spacetimes separately are known to admit complete geodesics .",
    "one drawback of our solution is that @xmath249 limit i.e. the ml limit does nt exist . in a single coordinate patch the large type - d einstein - maxwell family of plebanski and demianski ( pd )",
    "also suffers a similar problem . in this",
    "regard our overall impression is that our non - smooth solution does nt belong to the class of pd .",
    "finally we add that this simple example may serve to pave the way for further superposed spacetimes in general relativity , including the higher dimensional ones ."
