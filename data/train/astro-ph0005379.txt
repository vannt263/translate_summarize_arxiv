    "the pca instrument on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) began scanning a 8@xmath4 region centered on the batse position some three hours after the burst ( @xcite ) and discovered a previously uncataloged x - ray source , which faded significantly over the observing interval ( @xcite ) .",
    "the initial 12  error circle for the rxte - pca position of  was further refined to a 30 arcmin@xmath5 region through the addition of timing annuli from the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , involving the near , ulysses and cgro satellites ( @xcite ) .    despite the fact that at least nine different optical telescopes imaged the ipn / rxte - pca region containing the x - ray transient ( some as early as 90 minutes after the burst )",

    "we report the discovery of a radio transient ( ) in this field , which we propose is the radio afterglow of grb 990506 .",
    "we also present upper limits on the brightness of the corresponding optical afterglow .",
    "we discuss the radio light curve of this transient , and its implications for the lack of detection of the optical afterglow .",
    "finally , we present the discovery of the probable host galaxy of the radio transient , and by implication the grb itself .  joins a small but growing class of bursts which evidently lack a bright optical transient but are seen at both x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations were initiated 1.5 days after the @xmath6-ray burst .",
    "details of this and all subsequent vla observations are given in table  [ tab : table - vla ] . in order to image the entire 11.5@xmath72.5  error region with the vla at 8.46 ghz",
    "two pointings were required , each with a field - of - view at half power response of 5.3  in diameter . in the southern field",
    "we detect two sources whose flux density ( @xmath8 @xmath9jy ) did not vary significantly from 1999 may 8 to 1999 may 21 .",
    "there were two additional sources in the northern pointing , only one of which was within the ipn / rxte - pca error box .",
    "this source , hereafter , was clearly detected during the first two epochs but had faded by at least a factor of three thirteen days later .",
    "was located at ( epoch j2000 ) @xmath10  =  @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13  =   @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , where the errors are the quoted 1@xmath16 uncertainties in the gaussian fit obtained from the combined images on may 8 and may 9 .",
    "the source has not been detected since at any frequency ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a search was made for polarized emission by imaging the combined datasets on may 8 and 9 in all four stokes parameters .",
    "the 3@xmath16 upper limits were 30% for both linear and circular polarization .",
    "of immediate concern is the possibility that  is a background variable radio source lying by chance within the moderately large ipn / rxte - pca error box . on the basis of the radio data alone",
    "we can not eliminate this possibility altogether .",
    "however , the order of magnitude change in source strength over the two weeks immediately following the grb , and the failure to detect any subsequent radio emission after monitoring for 375 days , strongly suggests that  was the afterglow of .",
    "we now proceed with this hypothesis .",
    "reaching a flux density of 580 @xmath9jy ,  is in the top half of the dozen radio radio afterglows detected to date ( ranked by flux density ) , fainter only than grb970508 , grb980703 , grb991208 , and grb991216 .",
    "there is some indication that the flux density increased from @xmath17=1.66 to 2.70 days ( see table  [ tab : table - vla ] ) but the change in flux @xmath18s=134@xmath1968 @xmath9jy is only marginally significant . some time between 2.5 days after the burst and 15.5 days",
    ", the radio afterglow declined below a detectable level .",
    "if we describe this decline in flux density , @xmath20 , as a power - law in time ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath21 ) then the minimum slope of the decline depends on the poorly determined time , @xmath22 , for the onset of the decline such that @xmath23 .",
    "we obtained our first optical image of the field of grb 990506 using the 60-inch ccd camera ( 160 arcmin@xmath5 field of view ) approximately 18 hr after the grb and continued for the next four nights .",
    "more details of the r - band optical observations to date are presented in table [ fig : log ] .",
    "no confirmed optically variable sources in the ipn error box were found by our group and others ( _ e.g. , _  henden _ et al . _  1999 ,",
    "@xcite ) .    at the position of the radio transient , an upper limit as strict as @xmath24 ( pedersen _ et al .",
    "1999b ) is placed on the brightness of any point - source optical afterglow starting 12 hours after the burst .",
    "table [ fig : log ] summarizes the @xmath25-band optical limits ; our @xmath26-band observations on the first fours days also revealed no counterpart to less stringent flux densities .    on 11 june 1999 ut , 35.78 days after the grb , we re - observed the field of grb 990506 at the position of the radio transient using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) on the keck ii 10-meter telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "six images of the field totaling 26 minutes of integration were obtained in the cousins @xmath25-band .",
    "observations of the standard field pg 1323 - 086 ( @xcite ) were used for magnitude zero - point calibration , which we also checked against the photometry by vrba _",
    "an astrometric plate solution was obtained relative to the usno a2.0 catalog ( monet _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) with a statistical error of 0.24 , 0.27 arcsec ( @xmath10 , @xmath13 ) .    figure [ fig : opt ] depicts the position of the radio transient and persistent 1.4 ghz emission overlaid atop the optical keck image .",
    "coincident with the position of the fading radio source is a faint extended ( ne - sw ) galaxy with an irregular morphology .",
    "the putative host appears as two knots of roughly equal brightness , with the radio transient position lying within the southwest knot .",
    "we find @xmath27 and @xmath28 mag for the northeast and southwest knots , respectively , based on photometry from the usno ( vrba _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "the error in these magnitudes reflects the uncertainty in the color of the galaxy and aperture correction .",
    "the morphology of the host is suggestive of a merging or interacting galaxy pair .",
    "in a deep radio image taken at 1.4 ghz on 1999 june 12 , two weak background radio sources are seen within 30@xmath29 of   ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the stronger of the two sources ( r1 ) is 23@xmath29 to the se and has a flux density of 540 @xmath9jy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "this source is undetected at 8.46 ghz , requiring either that it is resolved out at higher resolution or that it has a moderately steep spectral index , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the weaker of the two nearby sources ( r2 ) is detected some 30@xmath29 to the nw of .",
    "this source has a flux density of 170 @xmath9jy at 1.4 ghz and a spectral index steeper than @xmath32 . from recent spectroscopic observations ( see table [ fig : log ] ) we identify the two radio sources ( r1 and r2 ) with an early - type spiral and a qso at redshifts @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the simplest explanation for the behavior of the radio afterglow from  is that the emission originates in the forward shock driven into the surrounding medium by the relativistically expanding blast wave ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the apparent rise in the 8.46 ghz light curve to a maximum @xmath35 , followed by a decay is the result of an evolving synchrotron spectrum , produced from electrons accelerated in the shock , whose peak frequency @xmath36 passed through the band during our observing interval . as noted in  [ discovery ] , the exact time , @xmath22 , for the onset of the decay and the value of the power - law slope , @xmath37 , are uncertain owing to the undersampling of the light curve . given the data , a range of @xmath22 values from 1 to 5 days are possible .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath22 is determined by requiring that @xmath38 .",
    "significantly steeper values have yet to be seen for other afterglows .",
    "furthermore , this value is entirely consistent with the x - ray decay @xmath39 for this burst as measured by the rxte - asm ( @xcite ) . for @xmath40 days the corresponding values of the decay slope are @xmath41 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rlight ] we plot a 8.46 ghz light curve expected for a adiabatic forward shock , propagating in a homogeneous medium to demonstrate that such models are consistent with the data . in this representative model ,",
    "the peak flux is 580 @xmath9jy , @xmath22=2.5 days , and @xmath42 .",
    "the tightest constraint on @xmath37 and/or @xmath22 comes from the 1.4 ghz flux density upper limit on 1999 june 12.92 ut .",
    "reasonable model inputs predict peak flux densities at this frequency of order 100 - 200 @xmath9jy .",
    "therefore , at least this one epoch favors the steeper decay indices and the smaller @xmath22 values from the ranges given above .",
    "the estimated @xmath22 value suggests that  entered the decay phase at 8.46 ghz considerably earlier than previous radio afterglows . at this same frequency",
    "the decay timescales for grb970508 ( @xcite ) , grb980329 ( @xcite ) , grb980519 ( @xcite ) , grb990510 ( @xcite ) , grb981216 ( @xcite ) range from 8.5 days to 90 days .",
    "only grb 990123 exhibited a faster decay ( @xcite ; see below ) .",
    "one consequence of the early radio decay is that the apparent absence of the optical afterglow can now be understood rather simply without the need to invoke excess extinction along the line of sight .",
    "if the synchrotron peak moved through the radio band @xmath43 on the order of @xmath22=1 - 5 days , then the corresponding timescale for the peak to move through the optical bands @xmath44 is @xmath45 , or @xmath46 s ( @xcite ) .",
    "this small timescale can be contrasted with grb for which ramaprakash _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) derived @xmath47=0.6 days at @xmath48 hz .",
    "in general , the flux density decays from its peak @xmath35 as a power law with index @xmath37 for @xmath49 .",
    "provided that the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath35 remains constant ( as it should if dealing with a spherical , adiabatic expansion ) , then the peak 8.4 ghz flux density of 580 @xmath9jy predicts a peak optical afterglow emission of @xmath50 mag ( after correcting for foreground extinction ) .",
    "even a relatively shallow decay , @xmath51 , predicts that the ot was already undetectable at @xmath52 mag 90 minutes after the burst when the field of grb 990506 was observed by zhu & zhang ( 1999 ) . by the time of the deep @xmath25-band observations ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) the ot had @xmath53 mag and was likewise undetectable .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the early radio decay is indicative of unusual physical conditions .",
    "short - lived but moderately bright afterglows can result if the grb exploded with a high energy ( @xmath54 ) into a low density medium ( @xmath55 ) , or , as noted by galama _",
    "( 1999 ) , the magnetic field in the forward shock was weak . unfortunately , while we have constrained @xmath35 and @xmath56 , the paucity of broadband data for this burst does not allow us to determine other important observables such as the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath57 and the cooling frequency @xmath58 . without this information it is not possible to fully constrain the physical properties of the afterglow and the surrounding medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , prompt radio emission , analogous to the well - known optical emission ( @xcite ) , was also seen in the afterglow from grb ( @xcite ) and perhaps grb970828 as well .",
    "this radio emission arises in the reverse shock in the days following a @xmath6-ray burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is suppressed at early times by synchrotron self - absorption , while at later times the light curve decays rapidly ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we note that it is possible that the southwest knot may itself be the optical transient since the grb field has not been reimaged since 35 days after the burst .",
    "however , even a shallow decay in the optical of @xmath60 then predicts an @xmath25-band magnitude of 20.1 one day after the burst which was not observed .",
    "we thus find it unlikely that the southwest knot could be an optical transient given the early non - detections .",
    "instead , we interpret the two knots as part of the host galaxy of grb 990506 .",
    "the apparent @xmath25-band magnitude of the putative host of grb 990506 is similar to that of other grb host galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic observations are necessary in order to establish the redshift and other physical properties of this host galaxy",
    ". the bimodal morphology may be indicative of merger activity . in this respect",
    "the host appears similar to a growing number of grb hosts with irregular morphology : grb 980613 ( djorgovski _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) , grb 970828 ( djorgovski _ et al . _",
    "2000 ) , and grb 990123 ( bloom _ et al . _",
    "we have identified the radio afterglow from grb 990506 .",
    "this grb was unusual in that it produced a radio afterglow that began to fade at very early times ( between 1 and 5 days after the burst ) and in that no optical afterglow was detected in spite of the numerous deep images obtained .",
    "both these observations may be explained by a high energy spherical fireball expanding into a low density environment . in this simple picture",
    "there is no need to invoke dust extinction to account for the lack of detection of an optical afterglow .",
    "we can not rule out , however , that the radio emission originated in a reverse shock .",
    "if the reverse shock produced the radio afterglow , then the emission from the forward shock ( in both optical and radio ) was presumably too faint to be seen . to find additional grbs of this type",
    "will require more rapid followup to precise burst localizations than has typically been achievable .",
    "upcoming satellite missions such as hete ii and swift should improve upon this situation .",
