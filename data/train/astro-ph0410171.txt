    "ak  sco ( hd  152404 = iras  16514 - 3648 = hbc  271 = hip  82747 ) is a double - lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 13.6093  d , an eccentricity of 0.469 ( mathieu 1994 ) , and a projected separation of 0.143 au ( jensen et al .",
    "at a distance of @xmath7  pc ( bertout , robichon , & arenou 1999 ) , it might be an outlying member of the upper scorpio subgroup of the sco - cen association ( andersen et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "ak  sco is estimated to be @xmath8 yr old ( andersen et al . 1989 ) and has strong li absorption lines ( herbig & rao 1972 ) .",
    "however , its classification is unclear .",
    "the nir excess and large irregular light variations are more typical of a classical t  tauri star ( ctts ) , but the weak emission lines make it a weak - line t  tauri star ( wtts ) ( andersen et al .",
    "the spectral type is f5 v ( herbig & rao 1972 , hamann & persson 1992 ) which puts it in a group intermediate between t  tauris stars and f - type stars according to th , de winter , & prez ( 1994 ) .",
    "ak  sco has been known for decades to be highly variable at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "periods of roughly constant optical brightness at an average level are interrupted at irregular intervals by rapid variations ( bibo & th 1991 ) , with no correlation ( at least permanent ) with orbital period ( see jensen & mathieu 1997 ) .",
    "the large photometric variations are attributed to variable obscuration by circumstellar ( cs ) dust condensations ( andersen et al .",
    "1989 , hutchinson et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the submm continuum emission must arise outside the binary orbit , in a circumbinary ( cb ) disk ( jensen & mathieu 1997 ) with a predicted dynamically - cleared gap between 0.032 and 0.48  au .",
    "this gap can reproduce the observations if it is filled with optically thin material to reproduce a strong 10  silicate feature .",
    "however , since there is no evidence for a nir deficit of emission , this gap is not absolutely necessary ( jensen & mathieu 1997 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of circumbinary disks by gnther & kley ( 2002 ) show that in the dynamically - cleared gap in the cb disk , spiral arms bring cs matter from the cb disk to the cs disks around each star , in agreement with jensen & mathieu s ( 1997 ) interpretation of the sed with a gap filled with optically thin material .",
    "accretion is predicted to be synchronized with apastron , but ak  sco does not exhibit clear periodic excesses of luminosity at those phases .",
    "a model matching spectroscopic and photometric observations includes two identical stars ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) with an orbital inclination of @xmath1263 , embedded in a dense cloud with fine structure near the stars and grains larger than those of standard interstellar clouds .",
    "no uncertainty is given for the orbital inclination , but eclipses , which have not been observed so far , would be expected if @xmath13 .",
    "the cloud has a dimension similar to the size of the orbit and was determined to be the cause of the irregular variations .",
    "a cooler dust component also exists at a larger distance at @xmath14  au ( andersen et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "ak  sco s sed was also fit by gregorio - hetem & hetem ( 2002 ) to give stellar radii of 1.69@xmath15 , a disk radius of 10  au and an envelope radius of 1600  au .",
    "the optical depth was @xmath16 and the inclination 61 .",
    "the authors also classify ak  sco as a young main sequence star .",
    "alencar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have also used photometric and spectroscopic observations to find the physical parameters for the two near - identical stars : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , with an orbital inclination 65@xmath19 70 .",
    "the dust obscuration was also computed and reveals the existence of substructure at a scale of a stellar diameter .",
    "one side of the orbit would also be more obscured than the other .",
    "polarimetry of binaries , spectroscopic or visual , can be very useful to learn about the geometry of their systems ( see the recent review by manset 2004 , in preparation ) . in a recent series of papers ( manset & bastien 2000 , 2001 ; hereafter papers i and ii ) , we have studied numerically the polarization variations produced by electrons and dusty envelopes surrounding binary stars , and we have also developed tools to compare observations of pre - main sequence ( pms ) binaries with analytical and numerical models and applied them to about two dozens pms binaries ( manset & bastien 2001b , 2002 , 2003 ; hereafter papers iii , iv , and v ) .    in this paper , we present simultaneous polarimetric and photometric observations of ak sco ( sec .",
    "2 ) , use the tools developed earlier to analyze these data ( sec .",
    "3 ) , and compare with the photometric data ( sec .",
    "4 ) . finally , we compare our results with those of other pms binaries ( sec . 5 ) and with numerical simulations ( sec .",
    "the photometric and polarimetric observations were carried out between 1982 february 12@xmath2024 with the european southern observatory ( eso ) photometer and polarimeter mounted respectively on the 50-cm and 1.0-m telescopes at la silla , chile .",
    "standard @xmath0 bandpasses were used for the photometric observations .",
    "the polarimetric bandpasses approximate the usual @xmath0 bands , and are defined by the following central wavelengths and bandwidths : 3550 ( 700 ) , 4300 ( 1000 ) , and 5250 ( 500 )  . for the polarimetry , a 14  aperture hole was used .",
    "data were reduced using the eso data reduction programs .",
    "primary photometric standard stars and two comparison stars within 1  from ak  sco , hr  8331 ( sao  208130 , k0 ) and hr  8351 ( sao  208088 , g5 ) , were observed on every night during the observing period , except on 1982 february 14 - 15 ( ut ) .",
    "table  [ tab - compstars ] gives the average values , standard deviations , and the number of observations for the two comparison stars .",
    "these standard deviations are somewhat larger than expected for a good photometric site such as la silla , because the stars ( comparison stars and ak  sco ) have purposely been observed starting at large air masses in order to increase the time coverage as much as possible .",
    "this has no significant effect on the results because the observed variations are much larger than the errors .",
    "the standard deviations are larger in the @xmath4 band ( and also b and u , although not given ) than in the colors because the atmospheric fluctuations are larger in the total extinction ( e.g. , @xmath21 for @xmath4 ) than they are in the colors ( a differential effect , e.g. , @xmath22 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the two comparison stars clearly show a stable non - variable behavior , which demonstrates the photometric variability of ak  sco .",
    "the photometric data are listed in table  [ tab - phot ] .",
    "standard polarized and unpolarized stars have been observed throughout the observing run .",
    "the instrumental polarization was found to be @xmath23 0.05% and was therefore neglected .",
    "the polarization data are given in tables  [ tab - data3550 ] to [ tab - data5250 ] .",
    "large amplitude variations in both photometric and polarimetric data are readily noticed .",
    "these amplitudes are typically 0.5  mag in @xmath4 , 0.12  mag in @xmath3 , and 0.20  mag in @xmath24 , and 0.9% , 47  at 3550 , 1.0% , 30  at 4300 , and 0.8% , 22  at 5250 .",
    "the most striking feature is that usually when the star is bright , the polarization is small and when the polarization is large , the star is fainter and also redder .    in the next section , we first estimate the contribution of interstellar polarization to the observed polarization , then discuss the variability and periodicity of the polarization .",
    "the heiles ( 2000 ) polarization catalog , which contains polarimetric observations for more than 9000 stars , was used to estimate the interstellar ( is ) polarization in the vicinity of ak  sco by selecting 23 stars located within 80  pc and 15  of it .",
    "the map of is polarization is presented in figure  [ fig - polis_aksco ] .",
    "the is distance - weighted polarization calculated by averaging the polarization of the 23 stars is 0.70% @xmath25 0.16% in the @xmath4 band .",
    "the is grains alignment is relatively good because the non - weighted average position angle is @xmath26 , whereas the distance - weighted value is @xmath27 .",
    "see paper  v for more details about our averaging procedure .",
    "ak  sco s average polarization ( @xmath28=27 ) is 0.70% at 132  at 3550 , 0.84% at 132  at 4300 , and 1.0% at 133  at 5250   ( see tables  [ tab - data3550 ] to [ tab - data5250 ] for the detailed observations ) .",
    "these levels of polarization are comparable to the is polarization and indicate the presence of is polarization in ak  sco s measurements .",
    "however , the weighted and non - weighted is position angles are different than ak  sco s position angle values , and indicate the presence of intrinsic polarization .",
    "we therefore conclude that ak  sco s observed polarization is a sum of is and intrinsic polarization .",
    "bastien ( 1985 ) had also found that ak  sco s polarization is in part intrinsic and in part interstellar .",
    "using our estimate of the is polarization , 0.70% at 165  in the @xmath4 band , and serkowski s law for is polarization ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ) , we have found the is polarization value for the 3 observed wavelengths .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath29  for serkowski s law ( a typical value ) and that the position angle of the is polarization is constant as a function of wavelength . after subtracting this estimated is polarization from the observed one , we get the estimated intrinsic polarization for ak  sco : 0.70% at 108  at 3550 , 0.83% at 109  at 4300 , and 0.94% at 112  at 5250 .",
    "ak  sco s intrinsic polarization is high .",
    "data taken for other pms binaries ( but at a redder wavelength , 7660 , see papers  iii @xmath20 v ) indicate that ak  sco has one of the highest intrinsic polarization .",
    "the significant intrinsic polarization indicates that the circumstellar or circumbinary material around this binary has an asymmetric configuration , for example , a disk rather than a spherical shell .",
    "two other facts point to an intrinsic polarization component in the observed polarization for ak  sco .",
    "first , ak  sco shows clear periodic variations ( see below ) that can not be of is origin .",
    "second , the position angle of the polarization varies as a function of wavelength ( see below ) .",
    "observations of polarized standard stars ( whose polarization is of is origin ) by schmidt , elston , & lupie ( 1992 ) show that the maximum observed rotation of the position angle between 4350 and 8580  is @xmath30 , much less than the @xmath31 rotation seen for ak  sco .",
    "as discussed by dolan & tapia ( dolan & tapia 1986 and references cited ) , a wavelength - dependent position angle could in theory be attributed to multiple is clouds containing different grain sizes magnetically aligned in different directions , or to an is cloud where there is a continuous rotation of the grains orientation , but , once again , the variability argument points to the presence of intrinsic polarization .      already from the data presented in the tables and figures , it is obvious that ak  sco s polarization is variable , as had been found by serkowski ( 1969 ) , bastien ( 1985 ) , and drissen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . nonetheless , we applied various tests to check the polarimetric variability or stability of ak  sco : minimum and maximum values , variance test , @xmath32 test , and finally , a @xmath33 test .",
    "it should be noted that these tests usually assume that the parent distribution of the quantity measured ( here , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or the stokes parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) is normal .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath35 are not distributed normally ( serkowski 1958 ) , these tests should in general be applied only to the stokes parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have calculated the variance of the sample @xmath38 and compared it to the standard deviation of the mean @xmath39 .",
    "for a set of observations of a non - variable quantity , the sample variance will be small and similar to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "but if there is variability , the `` width '' of the observations , or variance , will be greater than the standard deviation of the mean .    for the @xmath32 test , if the data are `` well behaved '' , or `` consistent '' , @xmath40 within its standard error .",
    "if @xmath32 differs significantly from 1 , then there may be variability .",
    "lastly , @xmath33 values are calculated for @xmath36 and @xmath37 separately , using 1@xmath41 and @xmath42 . the probability to obtain a given value of @xmath33 in a gaussian distribution",
    "is found for each of the four @xmath33 values .",
    "the star is variable if at least 2 of the four @xmath33 values are over 0.95 ; the star is suspected to be variable if one out of four @xmath33 values is over 0.95 .",
    "details and formulas for these tests were presented in a previous paper ( paper  iv ) .",
    "results of the tests are presented in table  [ tab - var ] and clearly indicate that ak  sco s polarization was variable for all 3 filters , over a 12-day period in february 1982 .",
    "variations are observed from night to night and also within the same night , and this variability is more pronounced at 4300 .",
    "ak  sco presents one atypical observation , taken on february 13 in the @xmath37 filter , where the position angle measured departs markedly from the other values ( see table  [ tab - data3550 ] and figure  [ fig-3550all ] ) .",
    "atypical observations such as this one were also found in many of the pms binaries studied previously ( papers  iii , iv , and v ) and are not related to the orbital motion but probably to eruptive - like events . since the data for ak  sco was obtained with an instrument different than the one used for papers  iii@xmath20v , this confirms that it is not an instrumental effect .",
    "since the position angle varies , it implies that if the polarization is due to a cloud in orbit around the stars , the line of sight is not in the orbital plane , in agreement with the orbital inclination found by others .",
    "serkowski ( 1969 ) observed ak  sco with @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and @xmath4 filters and a 25  aperture hole over a 454 day period .",
    "although the uncertainties are rather high ( mean error 0.11% in the @xmath4 and @xmath43 filters , higher in the @xmath37 filter ) , the data indicate variability on time scales of days in all three filters .",
    "the polarization changes from 0.3 to 0.8% , and the position angle , from 60  to 145 .",
    "interestingly , the polarization variations sometimes go in opposite directions in the @xmath4 and @xmath43 filters ; when the polarization in the @xmath4 filter increases , the polarization in the @xmath43 filter decreases .",
    "the variations in position angle usually , but not always , increase or decrease at the same time in both filters .",
    "there are no long - term trends ( the mean polarization does not change much from month to month or over a few months ) .",
    "the mean position angle is the same in the @xmath43 and @xmath4 filters .",
    "bastien ( 1985 ) has observed ak  sco in various filters . as with the serkowski ( 1969 ) data ,",
    "these observations show variability on time scales of a day , with variations in all filters , and up to 1% and up to 45 . the amplitude of the polarimetric variations is greater in the @xmath37 band than in the visual bands . on one occasion",
    ", the polarization decreased in the @xmath37 and @xmath4 filters while increasing in the @xmath43 filter .",
    "the average polarization in all wavelengths was significantly higher during bastien s observations ( in 1981 ) that during serkowski s ( from 1967 to 1969 ) .",
    "drissen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) have observed ak  sco at 7500   in 1986 .",
    "the data indicate once again variability on a nightly basis .",
    "the average polarization seems to be at the same level as that of 1981 .",
    "hutchinson et al . (",
    "1994 ) observed ak  sco in @xmath43 and @xmath44 in 1986 .",
    "the level of polarization and the position angle are similar to the 1980 s data .",
    "they noted that the flux in the infrared @xmath28 band rises as the visual flux declines , which means the @xmath4 band variations seen during their run are unlikely to be caused by the binarity .",
    "they also concluded that the occultation model is consistent with the data in some cases but does not always work with the simultaneous observations in the optical and ir .",
    "all these data indicate that polarimetric variability is mostly present on time scales of hours and days , and decades ( when comparing serkowski s data to all the other sets of data ) .",
    "variations are observed at all wavelengths .",
    "the variations for different filters usually go in the same direction ; 2 different sets of data have shown variations in opposite direction for the @xmath4 and @xmath43 filters .",
    "the amplitude of the variations is higher in the blue than in the yellow .",
    "no variation that could mimic the behavior of the polarization during an eclipse was observed .",
    "figures  [ fig-3550all ] to [ fig-5250all ] present the polarimetric observations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the stokes parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 as a function of the orbital phase , calculated with the ephemeris @xmath47 , with the period from mathieu ( 1994 ) and an arbitrary starting point .",
    "alencar et al . (",
    "2003 ) have found a periastron time of passage of 46654.3634@xmath250.0086 , which puts the periastron at around phase 0.64 in our data .",
    "observations are represented as first and second harmonics of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the orbital phase , @xmath50 and the solid lines are fits made to the following equations : + @xmath51 the coefficients of this fit are then used to find the orbital inclination according to the bme formalism ( brown , mclean & emslie 1978 ) : + @xmath52 ^ 2 & = & \\frac{(u_1+q_2)^2 + ( u_2-q_1)^2}{(u_2+q_1)^2 + ( u_1-q_2)^2 } \\label{eq - io1-p3},\\\\ \\left [ \\frac{1-\\cos i}{1+\\cos i } \\right]^4 & = & \\frac{(u_3+q_4)^2 + ( u_4-q_3)^2}{(u_4+q_3)^2 + ( u_3-q_4)^2 } \\label{eq - io2-p3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the polarization @xmath34 varies by 0.9% in @xmath37 , 1.0% in @xmath43 , and 0.8% in @xmath4 . the position angle @xmath35 variations decrease from 47  in @xmath37 , to 30  in @xmath43 , and to 22  in @xmath4 .",
    "variations are then more apparent in the blue ( 3550  @xmath20 4300 ) than in the yellow ( 5250 ) part of the spectrum .",
    "data taken during 12 consecutive nights show clear and regular variations , with some scatter but less than for many of the other binaries that were observed over longer periods of time ( papers  iv and v ) .",
    "this might be an indication that observations gathered over a small interval of time will show less scatter and clearer periodic variations .",
    "data taken by serkowski ( 1969 ) over 450 days , or even by drissen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) over 40 days do not show the regular variations presented here .",
    "there is a strong peak ( or dip ) seen in @xmath34 and @xmath37 between phases 0.4 and 0.5 , just before periastron , seen in all 3 filters .",
    "this peak is not clearly present in the serkowski data , but might be present in the drissen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) data , only defined by one observation .",
    "the bastien ( 1985 ) data do not cover the appropriate orbital phases .",
    "in addition to these single - periodic variations ( seen once per orbit ) , the fit indicates the presence of a smaller secondary peak .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that for circular orbits , only double - periodic variations are seen ; as the eccentricity increases , single - periodic variations become predominant ( see papers  i and ii ) . the presence of the single - periodic variations is qualitatively compatible with the high eccentricity , @xmath53 .",
    "the ratio of the amplitude in 1@xmath54 over the amplitude in 2@xmath54 is 7.34 for @xmath36 , 1.14 for @xmath37 , 1.09 for @xmath34 , and 4.15 for @xmath35 , at 5250 .",
    "however , the single - periodic variations for @xmath36 and @xmath35 clearly dominate over the double - periodic ones , and this is not seen in our simulations for @xmath55 and a cb disk unless the inclination is much lower ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "ak  sco and ntts  162814 - 2427 ( paper  v ) are the only two examples so far of very strong single - periodic variations .",
    "theses two binaries also have a very high eccentricity ( 0.47 and 0.48 respectively ) .",
    "other explanations exist for the predominance of the single - periodic variations : stars of different masses and luminosities , an asymmetric configuration ( with respect to the orbital plane ) of the cb disk , or the presence of a cs disk . we know that the luminosity ratio of the two components is 4 ( andersen et al . 1989 ) but this is not enough to explain the morphology of the variations .",
    "cs disks ( although small ) are possible , along with a cb disk .",
    "the strong amplitude of the @xmath34 variations , of over 0.5% , is compatible with the fact that a cleared central region is not necessarily indicated by the spectral energy distribution ; we have shown in paper  i that when scatterers are located close to the stars , they produce more pronounced variations .      polarization is almost always lower in the blue and higher in the yellow part of the spectrum .",
    "the position angle also varies as a function of the wavelength , with different dependencies on the wavelength .",
    "bastien ( 1985 ) noted the highly variable wavelength dependence .",
    "hutchinson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also present a @xmath57 curve .",
    "the photometric data are presented in table  [ tab - phot ] and figure  [ fig - phot ] .",
    "variations are clearly present , and follow the same time - dependence for the 3 wavelengths .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig - colormag ] , ak  sco is bluer when bright , and redder when faint , with no color reversal ( when a further decrease in brightness is followed by bluer colors again ) , a behavior that had already been found by bibo & th ( 1991 ) using over 100 observations spread over more than 3 years , and by hutchinson et al .",
    ". a coarse study of the photometric data presented by bibo & th ( 1991 ) , especially in their figure  29 , shows that the photometric behavior of ak  sco is not clearly periodic but shows rapid variations .",
    "hutchinson et al . ( 1994 ) also noted that the @xmath58 m flux increases when the star gets fainter , an observation that is attributed to a major change in the outer dust distribution ( @xmath59  au ) , indicating that a simple occultation model is inadequate .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram @xmath3 , @xmath4 exhibits a ratio of total to selective absorption of @xmath5 , higher than in normal interstellar clouds where @xmath6 .",
    "this had already been noted by andersen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and would be characteristic of circumstellar ( as opposed to is ) matter ( strom et al . 1972 ) .",
    "there is also a correlation between the photometry and the polarimetry : the polarization is low when the star is blue , and higher when the star is redder ( see figure  [ fig - polcolor ] ) .",
    "photometry and polarimetry in the @xmath43 band is presented in figure  [ fig - bdata ] .",
    "the behavior is that when the star gets fainter , it also gets redder and its polarization increases .",
    "there is no evidence in our data for eclipses of one component of the binary by the other , as was suspected by andersen et al .",
    "an inclination higher than 63  would however make an explanation of the correlated photometric and polarimetric variations easier .",
    "the simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations increase the diagnostic value of the data .",
    "the interpretation is that a cloud of circumstellar matter passes in front of the star , decreasing the amount of direct , unpolarized light , and increasing the contribution of scattered and polarized light .",
    "this explains the decrease in brightness , the reddening , and the increase in polarization .",
    "as shown in previous papers , the results of the bme formalism will only give reasonable results if the stochastic noise present in the data does not exceed some limit .",
    "since ak  sco s data was taken over a short period of time ( within one orbit ) , the data suffer from less noise than for our other binaries ( see papers  iv and v ) . even with data with less scatter , the noise ( square root of the variance of the fit over the amplitude of the variations ; the amplitude comes from the maximum values of the data and not of the fit ) is still above the 10% limit .",
    "therefore , we can not confirm or infirm the 63  inclination found by andersen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "even though the results of the bme formalism might not be significant , at least for the orbital inclination , they are presented in table  [ tab - bme ] for the 3 wavelengths , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 refer to the coefficients of single- and double - periodic variations .",
    "the inclination found increases with wavelength , but this might not be significant considering the uncertainties on the results .",
    "ak  sco has relatively high values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( 1 - 2 @xmath64 ) , a factor of @xmath12 10 higher than the values for other binaries ( of all types ) , and the highest values for our sample of pms binaries .",
    "the ratios @xmath65 are typical values .",
    "it is interesting to note that ak  sco has clear evidence for a cb disk whose central region is not necessarily totally empty .",
    "gw  ori , ntts  162814 - 2427 and ntts  162819 - 2423s , which also have massive cb disks but with central holes , have @xmath62 and @xmath63 values typical of the other pms binaries .",
    "the values of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and the ratio are similar for the @xmath43 and @xmath4 bands , but are different in the @xmath37 band .",
    "since the orbital inclination and eccentricity are known , we tried to reproduce the observed polarimetric variations with various geometries . even with these two parameters set , it is difficult to reproduce the data , in particular the large observed polarization amplitude .",
    "figure  [ fig - simulcb ] presents the results of a simulation with a cb disk surrounding the binary , which is at the center of an evacuated cavity ( see figure  1 in paper  ii for a sketch of that geometry ) .",
    "the disk s radius is set to 1.0 and has a flatness of 25% ( the third axis equals 0.25 the disk radius ) ; the central spherical cavity has a radius of 0.20 ; the orbital parameters are @xmath66 , @xmath53 , and orbital radius 0.1 ; astronomical silicate grains of radii 0.1@xmath67 were used , with an optical depth @xmath68 in the equatorial plane ( @xmath69 in the line of sight ) .",
    "the stars have equal masses ( and luminosities ) .",
    "variations are double - periodic but do not have the strong single - periodic variations seen in the observations , and the amplitude is smaller ( 0.02% compared to the observed 0.8% ) . if the inclination is not as low as @xmath66 ( andersen et al .",
    "1989 ) , our simulations still can not reproduce the amplitude or morphology of the observed variations .",
    "since we had found earlier that cs disk geometries are more favorable to high amplitude variations , we did a simulation with only a cs disk around the primary ( see figure  5 in paper  ii for a sketch of the geometry ) . figure  [ fig - simulcs ] presents the polarimetric variations resulting from such a geometry .",
    "the cs disk has axes of radii 0.2 , 0.2 , and 0.1 , and a spherical cavity of radius 0.05 .",
    "the same grains and orbital characteristics were used , except that the orbital radius was set to 0.5 .",
    "the optical depth in the line of sight is now 0.07 .",
    "the primary illuminating its disk from the inside only introduces noise in the polarization with amplitude 0.02% .",
    "the figure shows only the polarization caused by the secondary illuminating the disk externally .",
    "the variations show two strong peaks close to each other that do not really reproduce the observations ; the amplitude is also too small ( 0.1% ) although the variations produced are more important than for the cb disk case .",
    "the polarization is highest around phase zero , when the primary and its disk are closest to the observer and the secondary is behind .",
    "since it is known that electrons usually produce more polarization and higher amplitude variations , we tried the cs disk geometry with electrons .",
    "there were no change in the shape of the variations nor their amplitude .",
    "if the optical depth is increased from 0.1 to 0.3 , the amplitude of the variations goes from 0.09% to almost 0.12% .",
    "if the periastron angle is changed from 0  to 90 , variations go from 0.09% to 0.17% .",
    "the maximum amplitude that we can get with our single scattering code , with electrons to maximize @xmath70 , but still retaining axial symmetry for the distribution of scatterers around the primary ( the only asymmetry is that of the binary ) is @xmath71% .",
    "there are two other options that would probably increase the amplitude of the polarization variations , a larger optical depth , and also having a non - axisymmetric density distribution around one ( or both ) stars .",
    "for example , a stream of material falling onto the star along a magnetic flux tube as in some recent observations for aa  tau ( bouvier et al . 2003 ) or in the high - resolution numerical simulations of gnther & kley ( 2002 ) , would have scatterers close to the star , where the polarization per scatterer is larger .",
    "we leave these two possibilities to future modelling efforts .",
    "we have presented simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations of a pms spectroscopic binary , ak  sco . the mean observed polarization ( @xmath28=27 )",
    "is 0.70% at 132  at 3550 , 0.84% at 132  at 4300 , and 1.0% at 133  at 5250 .",
    "if an estimate of the interstellar polarization is removed , the intrinsic polarization for ak  sco is still significant , 0.70% at 108  at 3550 , 0.83% at 109  at 4300 , and 0.94% at 112  at 5250 .",
    "this indicates the presence of circumstellar matter distributed in an asymmetric geometry ( like a flattened envelope or disk ) .",
    "ak  sco s polarization can not be of interstellar origin only because ( 1 ) the position angles for the interstellar and observed polarizations are different , ( 2 ) ak  sco s polarization @xmath34 is variable , ( 3 ) its position angle also varies , as a function of time and wavelength .",
    "the polarization is clearly variable at all wavelengths , on time scales of hours , days , months , and years , which is a typical behavior for pms stars .",
    "the data were obtained on 12 consecutive nights , almost covering the 13.6 day period .",
    "regular variations are seen and have amplitudes of @xmath72% , @xmath73 , the highest seen so far for pms binaries .",
    "those variations are more apparent in the blue ( 3550@xmath204300 ) than in the yellow part of the spectrum ( 5250 ) and are compatible with the presence of circumstellar matter located close to the stars .",
    "the variations are not simply double - periodic ( as produced by a simple model of 2 equal mass stars in a circular orbit , at the center of an axisymmetric circumbinary envelope made of electrons ) , but include single - periodic variations .",
    "the presence of single - periodic variations could be due to non equal mass stars , the presence of dust grains , an asymmetric configuration of the circumstellar or circumbinary material , or the eccentricity of the orbit ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the polarimetric data show some scatter but less than for many of the other pms binaries that were observed over longer periods of time ( papers  iv and v ) .",
    "we believe this indicates that observations of binaries gathered over a small interval of time compared to the time scale characteristic of modifications in the cs environment will suffer less from epoch - to - epoch variations in the average polarization , and therefore show less scatter and clearer periodic variations .",
    "the polarization varies as a function of wavelength , and is almost always lower in the blue and higher in the red .",
    "the position angle also varies as a function of the wavelength , with different dependencies on the wavelength .",
    "both ak  sco s polarization level and position angle vary as a function of time and wavelength .",
    "large amplitude variations are also seen in photometry , with typical amplitudes of 0.5  mag in @xmath4 , 0.12  mag in @xmath3 and 0.20  mag in @xmath24 .",
    "these photometric variations are also correlated to the polarimetric ones : usually , when the star is bright , its polarization is small , and when the polarization is large , the star is fainter and redder .",
    "these photometric and polarimetric variations are compatible with occultation by a cs dust cloud in orbit in a dusty circumbinary envelope .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram @xmath3 , @xmath4 exhibits a ratio of total to selective absorption of @xmath5 , higher than in normal interstellar clouds where @xmath6 , and characteristic of circumstellar ( as opposed to interstellar ) matter .",
    "there is no evidence for eclipses of one component of the binary by the other , in both the photometric and the polarimetric data .",
    "since numerical simulations produce high - amplitude variations for circumstellar disks rather than for circumbinary disks , this suggests the presence of cs ( and maybe also cb ) disks , although the short period does not allow large cs disks .",
    "alternatively , this indicates that there is matter close to the stars , for example in a cb disk whose central cavity is not completely evacuated , or in a stream from the cb disk to the star .",
    "a detailed analysis of the polarimetric data shows that the bme formalism , which could be used to find the orbital inclination , is not able to recover that information . even though an inclination higher than 63would help explain the anticorrelation between the star s brightness and its polarization if a cloud of dust passes in the line of sight , the bme inclination between 80 and 90cannot be regarded as a meaningful result .",
    "therefore , we can not confirm the orbital inclinations found by andersen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) or alencar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , 63 , and 65  @xmath75 70  respectively .",
    "there are many free parameters , and even with the known inclination and eccentricity , our numerical simulations could not reproduce the observations .",
    "the maximum polarization amplitude we can obtain with a single scattering model assuming an axially symmetric density distribution of scatterers around the center of mass ( cb envelope ) or around a single star ( cs disk ) , is 0.20% .",
    "two avenues to explore further are : take into account multiple scattering , and include non - axisymmetric density distributions such as a stream of material falling onto a component of the binary ( or both ) .",

    "<S> we present simultaneous @xmath0 polarimetric and photometric observations of the pre - main - sequence binary ak  sco , obtained over 12 nights , slightly less than the orbital period of 13.6 days . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization is a sum of interstellar and intrinsic polarization , with a significant intrinsic polarization of 1% at 5250 , indicating the presence of circumstellar matter distributed in an asymmetric geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization and its position angle are clearly variable on time scales of hours and nights , in all 3 wavelengths , with a behavior related to the orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> the variations have the highest amplitudes seen so far for pre - main - sequence binaries ( @xmath11% , @xmath2 ) and are sinusoidal with periods similar to the orbital period and half of it . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization variations are generally correlated with the photometric ones : when the star gets fainter , it also gets redder and its polarization increases . </S>",
    "<S> the color - magnitude diagram @xmath3 , @xmath4 exhibits a ratio of total to selective absorption @xmath5 higher than in normal interstellar clouds ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations is that a cloud of circumstellar matter passes in front of the star , decreasing the amount of direct , unpolarized light , and hence increasing the contribution of scattered ( blue ) light . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the large amplitude of the polarization variations can not be reproduced with a single scattering model and axially symmetric circumbinary or circumstellar disks . </S>"
