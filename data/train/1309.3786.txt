    "the electric potential @xmath0 is set @xmath5 , with @xmath2 the screening number and @xmath3 the radius . finding approximate screening functions @xmath4 is an open - ended guessing game , that ( in the case of the neutral thomas - fermi atom at least ) has lead to too many publications already .",

    "well , as to the first formula , given its analytical simplicity , the numerical precision is astonishing .",

    "alternatively , we may simply use the value of @xmath42 known from numerical integration .",
    "the corresponding parameter set is @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .    finally , if we want to reproduce the asymptotic behaviour @xmath54 , we must set @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",

    "the action evaluated with sommerfeld s trial function is @xmath72    a numerical analysis shows the action is minimal for the parameter values @xmath73    the minimal action gives an upper limit for the binding energy @xmath71 and the initial slope @xmath42 of the `` true '' screening function , see eqn .

    "the procedure outlined above can be transfered to other quantities such as the inte- grated electron number @xmath76 , or the electron number density @xmath77 : one tries to describe it with the 4-parameter expression @xmath78 , which can be manipulated relatively easily , finds the lagrangian and action to this quantity , and then fixes @xmath79 and @xmath65 by minimizing or maximizing the action .",
    "actually , doing exactly this leads not to significant improvement in the quality of the approximate formulas for @xmath4 .",
    "we need some new idea . and",
    "here it is :      the slope of the screening function is @xmath80 for the neutral tf - atom , @xmath81 we now use @xmath2 as the independent variable , and try to fit @xmath82 for the neutral atom with the trial function @xmath83 where @xmath84 note the formal similarity of ( 17 ) with sommerfeld s ansatz ( 9 ) !",

    "the ansatz ( 17 ) together with ( 15 ) leads to the inverse screening function @xmath91    here , @xmath71 is the incomplete beta function , and @xmath92 is the hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "+ ( unfortunately , the conventions for the order of the arguments in the incomplete beta function and in the hypergeometric function disagree with each other . )    now let us calculate the best values of the free parameters @xmath42 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the differential equation for @xmath82 can be derived from the tf differential eqn .",
    "it is more easily expressed in terms of @xmath94 and turns out to be @xmath95 where the prime denotes now @xmath96 .",
    "equation ( 21 ) is the euler - lagrange equation @xmath97 to the lagrangian @xmath98    the action of this lagrangian is @xmath99=\\int_0 ^ 1 d\\chi l(\\eta,\\eta';\\chi)\\ ] ]    let us calculate the action @xmath100 we get for the @xmath93 satisfying eqn . ( 21 ) .",
    "we have @xmath101    according to @xcite these integrals are ( for the neutral atom ) @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "fortunately , we have here an exception to this rule : the variation of the action is @xmath105    for our trial function ( 17 ) , @xmath106 vanishes at @xmath107 if @xmath108 ( which is what we expect ) , i. e. @xmath42 may be varied along with @xmath34 and @xmath33 !      to evaluate of the action ( 23 ) we set @xmath110 the action is of the form @xmath111    the first integrals @xmath112 is @xmath113 the second integrals @xmath114 is @xmath115 we integrate @xmath114 by parts : @xmath116 is integrated , and @xmath117 is differentiated .",
