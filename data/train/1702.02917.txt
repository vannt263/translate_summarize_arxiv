    "topological objects are frequently described as the time - independent regular solutions possessing finite - energy arising from highly nonlinear euler - lagrange equations in the presence of appropriated boundary conditions @xcite . in some particular cases ,",
    "the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) formalism allows to show that these solutions can also satisfy a set of coupled first - order differential equations , the bps ones @xcite .    in this sense , vortices are radially symmetric solitonic configurations appearing in a planar scalar scenario endowed by a gauge field , their energies being commonly proportional to the magnetic flux , both ones being quantized ,  i.e. proportional to an integer winding number . in the context of the classical field theory ,",
    "these structures were firstly studied within the maxwell - higgs system , the self - interacting potential possessing no symmetric vacuum engendering topological bps vortex solutions only @xcite .",
    "similar objects were also encountered in a chern - simons - higgs scenario , the corresponding theory giving rise to both topological and nontopological bps vortices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , during the last years , many additional progress have been made regarding bps vortices arising within different theoretical scenarios , including generalizations of the abelian - higgs theories @xcite , lorentz - violating systems @xcite and gauged models with noncanonical kinetic terms @xcite , many of them being applied as an attempt to explain different cosmological and gravitational phenomena @xcite .",
    "in particular , in view of the developments introduced in @xcite , the question on whether a gauged @xmath2 model with @xmath3 supports topological vortices arises in a rather natural way , mainly due to the straight relation between the @xmath2 theory and the four - dimensional yang - mills - higgs one , the first mapping some interesting properties of the second @xcite .    in a very recent contribution @xcite",
    ", the author have investigated topological vortices arising within a gauged @xmath2 model , the electromagnetic and the @xmath2 scalar fields interacting minimally , the dynamics of the gauge sector being controlled by the usual maxwell term . in that work , the author have considered only non - bps profiles , the corresponding solutions being obtained via the second - order euler - lagrange equations , from which the author have also studied interesting properties of the resulting structures , such as the way the energy and magnetic flux depend on the parameters of the overall model .",
    "we now go a little bit further into such theme by considering the very same theoretical scenario , but now looking for a general first - order framework engendering radially symmetric bps vortices , whilst studying how these structures differ from their non - bps counterparts .    in order to present our results ,",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : firstly , in the next section ii , we introduce the gauged @xmath2 model we study , presenting some basic definitions and conventions .",
    "we particularize our investigation by focusing on the time - independent fields giving rise to radially symmetric configurations . in such a scenario ,",
    "we look for a consistent first - order framework by manipulating the expression for the effective energy functional in order to establish a well - defined lower bound for the corresponding total energy ( here , it is important to point out that such construction is only possible when a particular constraint involving the self - dual potential is fulfilled ) .",
    "we verify that this bound is saturated ( the energy being minimized ) when the profile functions describing the original fields satisfy a particular set of coupled first - order bps equations .",
    "we also calculate general results for the energy bound and the magnetic flux inherent to the bps configurations . in the section iii ,",
    "we investigate in detail the way the first - order expressions introduced previously generate legitimate self - dual solutions , whilst using the aforecited constraint to determine the potential term engendering self - duality , this way defining the vacuum manifold of the corresponding model .",
    "then , we solve the bps equations numerically via convenient boundary conditions , from which we obtain regular configurations possessing finite energy , also identifying and commenting the main features these solitons engender . finally , in the sec .",
    "iv , we present our conclusions and general perspectives regarding future contributions .",
    "we highlight that , throughout all this manuscript , we use the natural units system together with @xmath4 for the planar metric signature .",
    "we begin our investigation by considering the planar gauged @xmath2 model introduced in @xcite , its lagrange density reading@xmath5with @xmath6 being the usual electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath7 standing for a projection operator defined conveniently and @xmath8 representing the corresponding covariant derivative ( here , @xmath9 is a charge matrix , diagonal and real ) .",
    "additionally , the @xmath2 field @xmath10 is constrained to satisfy @xmath11 . in our notation ,",
    "greek indexes run over time - space coordinates , the latin ones counting the complex components of the @xmath2 field themselves .",
    "it is instructive to write down the static gauss law coming from ( [ ai1 ] ) , i.e. ( here , @xmath12 runs over spatial coordinates only)@xmath13the charge density being@xmath14 \\text{,}\\]]where @xmath15 . in this sense , according the gauss law ( [ aig1 ] ) , one concludes that the static configurations that the model ( [ ai1 ] ) engenders have null electric charge , being then compatible with the gauge condition @xmath16 which satisfies ( [ aig1 ] ) identically .    in this work , for the sake of simplicity , we consider the @xmath17 case , this way reducing our study to the @xmath0 scenario . in such a context , we look for time - independent solutions with radial symmetry . in this sense",
    ", we guide our calculations using the standard map ( with winding numbers @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) @xmath21@xmath22with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the bidimensional levi - civita tensor ( @xmath25 ) and the position unit vector , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , once we are interested in regular solutions presenting no divergences , the profile functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 must obey@xmath28as we demonstrate below , we use these conditions to obtain well - behaved field solutions related to ( [ ai1 ] ) .",
    "we highlight that , regarding the combination between the charge matrix @xmath29 and the winding numbers in ( [ li1 ] ) , there are two possibilities engendering topological solitons : ( i ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and ( ii ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( both ones with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the diagonal gell - mann matrices , i.e. @xmath37diag@xmath38 and @xmath39diag@xmath40 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite , the author have demonstrated that these two combinations simply mimic each other , this way existing only one effective scenario .",
    "therefore , in this work , we investigate only the case defined by @xmath31 , @xmath34 and@xmath41for convenience .    the differential equation for the profile function @xmath1 reads@xmath42giving rise to two constant solutions , i.e. @xmath43with @xmath44 . a priori , these solutions define two different cases .",
    "however , as we demonstrate later below , these cases engender the very same phenomenology , at least when concerning the bps results at the classical level .",
    "it is important to say that , from this point on , our expressions effectively describe the scenario defined by the choices we have introduced above .",
    "we focus our attention on those solutions satisfying a particular set of coupled first - order equations . in this work ,",
    "we obtain these equations by following the canonical approach , i.e. by requiring the minimization of the total energy of the system , the starting - point being the expression for the energy - momentum tensor related to the model ( [ ai1 ] ) , i.e.@xmath45from which one gets the radially symmetric energy density ( @xmath46)@xmath47 + v\\text { , } \\label{ai2}\\]]where we have introduced the auxiliary function@xmath48the solution for @xmath1 being necessarily one of those stated in ( [ betha ] ) .",
    "the point to be raised in that , whether we consider the very fundamental constraint@xmath49the energy density ( [ ai2 ] ) can be rewritten in the form@xmath50 ^{2}+\\varepsilon _ { bps}\\text { , }",
    "\\label{ai3}\\]]where we have defined@xmath51 \\text{.}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ ai3 ] ) shows that the corresponding energy exhibits a well - defined lower bound ( a property inherent to such a first - order construction ) , this bound being saturated when the profile functions @xmath52 and @xmath27 obey@xmath53@xmath54which are the effective bps equations the model ( [ ai1 ] ) engenders . in this sense ,",
    "when ( [ ai4 ] ) and ( [ ai5 ] ) are satisfied , the total energy of the resulting bps  configurations can be calculated explicitly , reading ( the upper ( lower ) sign holding for negative ( positive ) values of @xmath55)@xmath56being quantized in terms of @xmath55 itself . here",
    ", we have supposed that @xmath57 vanishes for @xmath58 ( indeed , @xmath59 stands for a finite - energy condition ) , with @xmath60 finite .",
    "another quantity commonly referred when studying first - order vortices is the magnetic flux @xmath61 they exhibit . in the present case ,",
    "the resulting flux reads@xmath62where @xmath63 must be chosen in order to fulfill the finite - energy requirement @xmath64 . here , we have used @xmath65 , prime denoting derivative with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath66 .    in the next section ,",
    "we use the first - order expressions we have introduced above to generate regular bps solutions with finite - energy .",
    "it is important to say that the self - dual equations ( [ ai4 ] ) and ( [ ai5 ] ) , together with the fundamental constraint ( [ ai0 ] ) , solve the second - order euler - lagrange ones coming from ( [ ai1 ] ) , therefore providing genuine solutions of the model .",
    "now , we investigate the solutions the first - order framework we have developed provides . here , we proceed as follows : firstly , we choose one particular solution for @xmath1 coming from ( [ betha ] ) . in the sequel",
    ", we use such a solution to solve the differential constraint ( [ ai0 ] ) , from which we obtain the corresponding self - dual potential @xmath67 related to that particular case .",
    "a posteriori , we implement these both solutions ( i.e. for @xmath1  and @xmath67 ) into the general expression for the energy density ( [ ai2 ] ) , this way getting the asymptotic boundary conditions the profile functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 must satisfy in order to generate finite - energy structures .",
    "then , using these conditions and the ones in ( [ ai00 ] ) , we solve the resulting first - order equations ( ai4 ) and ( [ ai5 ] ) numerically , obtaining the corresponding bps solutions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we depict these solutions and the physical profiles they engender ( energy density and magnetic field ) , also calculating their total energies and magnetic fluxes explicitly , from which we compare the final scenarios .",
    "then , let us consider the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69 separately .",
    "this case was partially considered in @xcite , the respective author suggesting that such construction was possible . here , we go a little bit further in such a investigation , showing that the general bps framework we have introduced recovers the expressions proposed in that work ( additionally reinforcing the coherence of our construction ) .",
    "we start by choosing@xmath71from which one gets that @xmath72 , the constraint ( [ ai0 ] ) reducing to@xmath73whose solution is ( we have used @xmath74 for the integration constant)@xmath75i.e . the self - dual potential related to the @xmath76 case",
    ", the resulting bps equations ( [ ai4 ] ) and ( [ ai5 ] ) standing for@xmath77@xmath78    now , in order to solve the equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v13 ] ) , beyond the behavior in ( [ ai00 ] ) , we need to specify the conditions the profile functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 obey in the asymptotic limit ( these conditions ensuring that the total energy of the final configurations is finite ) . in this sense , we implement ( [ v10 ] ) and ( [ v1 ] ) into the basic expression ( [ ai2 ] ) , from which we get@xmath79 + \\frac{g^{2}h^{2}% } { 2}\\cos ^{2}\\alpha \\text{,}\\]]with@xmath80the corresponding energy being finite for @xmath81 , @xmath26 and @xmath82 being then constrained to satisfy@xmath83with @xmath84 .    at this time",
    ", one can easily calculate the total energy @xmath85 ( [ ai6 ] ) and the magnetic flux @xmath61 ( [ ai7 ] ) of the resulting bps solitons , i.e.@xmath86both ones being quantized in terms of the winding number @xmath55 , as expected .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the way the fields @xmath87 and @xmath27 approximate the boundary values in ( ai00 ) and ( [ v14 ] ) . in order to perform such calculation , in what follows , we consider @xmath88 only ( i.e. the lower signs in the self - dual expressions ) , for simplicity .",
    "then , following the usual algorithm , we linearize the bps equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v13 ] ) in order to get the approximate solutions near the origin ( with @xmath89)@xmath90and in the asymptotic regime@xmath91@xmath92 being the masses of the corresponding bosons ( the relation @xmath93 typically defining the bogomolnyi limit ) , @xmath94 and @xmath95 standing for positive constants to be fixed by requiring the correct behavior near the origin and asymptotically .",
    "we summarize the scenario as follows : given the profile functions @xmath52 and @xmath27 satisfying the equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v13 ] ) , and obeying the boundary conditions ( [ ai00 ] ) and ( v14 ) , the resulting radially symmetric bps vortices exhibit quantized energy and magnetic flux given by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , whilst approaching the boundaries according the approximate solutions in ( [ v15 ] ) and ( [ v16 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , whether we implement @xmath89 , the potential in ( [ v1 ] ) can be written as @xmath98 , mimicking exactly the eq .",
    "( 15 ) in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in that same work , the author suggested that the choice @xmath99 does not support self - dual solutions .",
    "nevertheless , as we will demonstrate below , once we choose the self - dual potential conveniently , the case with @xmath100 indeed admits coherent bps solitons .",
    "now , we go further in our investigation by choosing@xmath102whilst giving rise to @xmath103 , the corresponding constraint being@xmath104engendering the solution@xmath105which stands for the self - dual potential related to @xmath106 . here",
    ", we have used @xmath107 for the integration constant .    in this case , the bps equations read@xmath108@xmath109    in order to determine the conditions the fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy in the asymptotic limit , we proceed as before , i.e. given ( [ carai ] ) and ( [ v17 ] ) , the expression ( [ ai2 ] ) for the energy density reduces to@xmath110 + \\frac{g^{2}h^{2}% } { 32}\\cos ^{2}\\left ( 2\\alpha \\right ) \\text{,}\\]]where@xmath111     ( solid black line for @xmath112 and dashed red line for @xmath113 ) and @xmath27 ( dot - dashed blue line for @xmath112 and long - dashed orange line for @xmath113 ) obtained via the bps equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v13 ] ) in the presence of the boundary conditions ( [ ai00 ] ) and ( [ v14 ] ) , for @xmath114.,width=321 ]    then , in order to fulfill the finite - energy requirement @xmath64 , @xmath26 and @xmath115 must behave as@xmath116from which we can also calculate the energy @xmath85 and the magnetic flux @xmath117 inherent to the resulting structures , i.e.@xmath118which are again quantized in terms of @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , we look for the way @xmath26 and @xmath82 behave near the boundaries by linearizing the first - order equations ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) around the contours values in ( [ ai00 ] ) and ( [ xx1 ] ) ( again , for simplicity , we use @xmath88 ) , from which one gets the approximate profiles near the origin@xmath119and in the limit @xmath58 , i.e.@xmath120with @xmath121 standing for the masses of the related particles ( @xmath122 still holding ) , @xmath123 and @xmath124 being positive constants to be fixed via the same manner as before .",
    "in such a scenario , given the conditions ( [ ai00 ] ) and ( [ xx1 ] ) , the solutions @xmath26 and @xmath27 that the equations ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) provide generate self - dual vortices possessing total energy @xmath125 and magnetic flux @xmath126 , behaving as the approximate profiles ( [ xx2 ] ) and ( xx3 ) in the appropriate limit .",
    "it is interesting to note that the potential in ( [ v1 ] ) can be written as the one in ( [ v17 ] ) whether we implement the redefinitions @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . notwithstanding , also the bps equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v13 ] ) reduce to those in ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) following the very same way ( the corresponding energies behaving in a similar manner , the magnetic fluxes being automatically the same ) .",
    "we highlight that such redefinitions are completely compatible also at level of the second order euler - lagrange equations .",
    "in this sense , we argue that the @xmath100 case mimics those results obtained via @xmath68 , both scenarios effectively describing the same phenomenology , at least concerning the bps solitons at the classical level .     for @xmath130 ( solid black line ) , @xmath131 ( dot - dashed blue line ) and @xmath132 ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the profiles are lumps centered at the origin.,width=321 ]    we end this section by presenting the numerical solutions we have found for @xmath133 , @xmath27 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 via the bps equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v13 ] ) in the presence of the boundary conditions ( [ ai00 ] ) and ( v14 ) . we have used @xmath114 , for simplicity",
    ".    , conventions being the same as in the previous figure 2 ( with the long - dashed orange line for @xmath113 ) : for @xmath112 , the solution is a lump ; for @xmath136 , the profiles are rings.,width=321 ]    in the figure 1 , we depict the numerical solutions to the profile functions @xmath133 ( solid black line for @xmath112 and dashed red line for @xmath113 ) and @xmath27 ( dot - dashed blue line for @xmath112 and long - dashed orange line for @xmath113 ) . in general , these profiles reach the boundary values in a monotonic manner , behaving according the approximate solutions we have calculated previously via the linearization of the bps equations",
    ". we also point out the way the gauge field coherently fulfills the condition @xmath137 , as expected .",
    "we plot the solutions to the magnetic field @xmath134 in the fig .",
    "2 , for @xmath112 ( solid black line ) , @xmath131 ( dot - dashed blue line ) and @xmath132 ( dashed red line ) , all these profiles being lumps centered at the origin ( the absolute value does not depending on the winding number @xmath55 , being equal to the unity ) . also , as the vorticity increases , the solutions spread over greater distances , the corresponding bosons mediating large - range interactions .    finally , the fig .",
    "3 shows the profiles to the bps energy density @xmath135 , the conventions being the same ones used in the figure 2 . here , for @xmath112 , the resulting solution is a lump centered at the origin . on the other hand , for @xmath136 ,",
    "the corresponding profiles are rings , their absolute values ( amplitudes ) lying on a finite distance @xmath138 from the origin ( this way defining the `` radius '' of the ring ) . in particular , these amplitudes ( radii ) decrease ( increase ) as the vorticity increases .",
    "in this work , we have considered the gauged @xmath0 model proposed in loginov , whilst obtaining in a coherent way the self - dual bps vortices such model supports .",
    "firstly , we have detailed the planar lagrange density defining the overall model , from which we have verified that such a system supports static solutions presenting no electric field ( @xmath16 satisfying the corresponding gauss law identically ) . in the sequel ,",
    "focusing our attention on those configurations presenting radial symmetry , we have implemented the well - known ansatz ( [ li0 ] ) and ( [ li1 ] ) together with convenient choices for the charges and winding numbers inherent to such maps .",
    "we have verified the constant solutions the profile function @xmath1 supports , this way splitting our investigation in a priori two different branches .",
    "in addition , whilst using a very fundamental constraint , we have rewritten the radially symmetric expression for the effective energy density in such a way highlighting the existence of a lower bound for the corresponding total energy .",
    "we have checked that the aforementioned bound is saturated when the functions @xmath26 and @xmath139 satisfy a particular set of coupled first - order bps  equations , also calculating the symbolic values for the total energy and the magnetic flux the final structures exhibit .",
    "we have divided our study according the two solutions @xmath140 admits .",
    "then , whilst considering these two cases separately , we have used the fundamental constraint introduced before to obtain the particular self - dual potentials such scenarios engender , also getting the corresponding bps equations and the appropriate boundary conditions . in view of such conditions ,",
    "we have calculated explicitly the values for the energy and the magnetic flux inherent to the resulting bps structures .",
    "moreover , we have concluded that the two solutions @xmath1 supports in fact engender the very same phenomenology , being physically equivalent .",
    "finally , we have plotted the numerical solutions we found for the relevant profiles , from which we have commented the general aspects they present .    in this sense ,",
    "rather natural ideas regarding new works include the search for the nontopological bps vortices the theoretical model we have studied here possibly engenders .",
    "furthermore , it is also interesting to consider the gauged @xmath0 theory when endowed by the chern - simons term ( instead of the maxwell one ) .",
