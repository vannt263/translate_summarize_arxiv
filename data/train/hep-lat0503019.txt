    "after the discovery  @xcite of @xmath10 followed by the other experiments  @xcite , identifying the properties of the particle is one of the central problems in hadron physics . while the isospin of @xmath11 is likely to be zero  @xcite , the spin and the parity and the origin of its tiny width still remain open questions  @xcite . in spite of many theoretical studies on @xmath11  @xcite ,",
    "the nature of this exotic particle , including the very existence of the particle , is still controversial . among theoretical approaches ,",
    "the lattice qcd calculation is considered as one of the most reliable _ ab initio _",
    "methods for studying the properties of hadronic states , which has been very successful in reproducing the non - exotic hadron mass spectra  @xcite . up to now , several lattice qcd studies have been reported , which aim to look for pentaquarks in various different ways . however , the conclusions are unfortunately contradictory with each other . on one hand , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite conclude that the parity of @xmath11 is likely to be negative , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the state with the similar mass to @xmath11 in the positive parity channel is reported . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the absence of @xmath11 is suggested .",
    "one of the difficulties in the spectroscopy calculation with lattice qcd arises from the fact that the hadron masses suffer from systematic errors due to the discretization , the chiral extrapolation , the quenching effect , the finite volume effect and the contaminations from higher excited - states .",
    "the difficulty specific to the present problem is that the signal of @xmath11 is embedded in the discrete spectrum of nk scattering states in finite volume . in order to verify the existence of a resonance state",
    ", one needs to isolate the first few low energy states including the lowest nk scattering state , identify a resonance state and study its volume dependence which can distinguish itself from other scattering states .",
    "therefore , ideally one should extract multistates from a high statistics unquenched calculation for several different physical volumes , where both the continuum and the chiral limits are taken .",
    "however , due to enormous computational costs , so far there are no lattice qcd study which performs all these steps .    in the present situation where even the very existence of the resonance state is theoretically in dispute ,",
    "the primary task is to provide evidences which distinguish the candidate resonance state from a scattering state .",
    "as long as other systematic errors only affect the numerical values of the masses but not the characteristic evidences of the resonance state , they may be neglected .",
    "even so , the isolation of the first few low energy states and the study of the volume dependence is a minimum requisite .",
    "therefore , at this stage as a first step towards a more complete analysis , we propose to focus only on analyses using rather heavy quarks on coarse quenched lattices but with a good statistics .",
    "by such a strategy , we can afford taking several different lattice volumes with thousands of gauge configurations so that the careful separation of states and the studies of volume dependence are possible .",
    "although giving well controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations may be important , we simply assume that the contents in spectra would not be drastically changed , although there are some cases where level crossings of resonance states occur as the quark masses decrease  @xcite .",
    "even with such a compromise , we can hopefully learn about the existence and much of the qualitative properties of @xmath11 .    in this paper , we study @xmath8 channel in quenched lattice qcd to search for possible resonance states .",
    "we adopt two independent operators with @xmath12 and @xmath13 and diagonalize the @xmath7 correlation matrices by the variational method for all the combinations of lattice sizes and quark masses to extract the 2nd - lowest state slightly above the nk threshold in this channel . after the careful separation of the states",
    ", we investigate the volume dependence of the energy as well as the spectral weight  @xcite of each state so that we can distinguish the resonance state from simple scattering states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the formalism used in the analysis in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] and show the simulation conditions in sec .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the process of the analysis is shown in sec .",
    "[ negative1]-[positive ] are devoted to the interpretation of the obtained results and the verification of the existence of a resonance state , as well as some checks on the consistency and the reliability of the obtained data . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss the operator dependence of the results and compare our results with the previous works .",
    "we finally summarize the paper in sec .",
    "[ summary ] . in appendix",
    ", we show the result of another trial to estimate the volume dependences of the spectral weights , which requires no multi - exponential fit .",
    "as @xmath11 lies above the nk threshold , any hadron correlators , which have the @xmath11 signal , also contain the discrete - level nk scattering states in a finite volume lattice . in order to isolate the resonance state from the scattering states",
    ", one needs to extract _ at least _ two states before anything else .",
    "since a double - exponential fit of a single correlator becomes numerically ambiguous , we adopt the variational method using correlation matrices constructed from independent operators  @xcite .",
    "a set of independent operators , \\{@xmath14 } for sinks and\\{@xmath15 } for sources , is needed to construct correlation matrices @xmath16 , which can be decomposed into the sum over the energy eigenstates @xmath17 as @xmath18 with the general matrices which depend on the operators as @xmath19 and the diagonal matrix @xmath20 from the product @xmath21 we can extract the energies \\{@xmath22 } as the logarithm of eigenvalues \\{@xmath23 } of the matrix @xmath24 .    while there are @xmath25 independent operators for the correlation matrix , the number of the intermediate states @xmath17 which effectively contribute to this matrix may differ from @xmath25 in general .",
    "let us call this number as @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath26 is larger than @xmath25 , the higher excited - states are non negligible and their contaminations give rise to a @xmath27-dependence of eigenvalues as \\{@xmath28}. if on the other hand @xmath26 is smaller than @xmath25 , @xmath29 becomes non - invertible so that the extracted energies become numerically fairly unstable and we can not extract all the @xmath25 eigenvalues . in order to have a reliable extraction of states , we therefore need to find an appropriate window of @xmath27 ( @xmath30 ) so that @xmath31 .",
    "( of course , even in the case when @xmath32 , we can extract @xmath26 eigenvalues with the reduced @xmath33 correlation matrices . ) the stability of \\{@xmath28 } against @xmath27 is expected in this @xmath27 range and we can obtain @xmath25 eigenenergies \\{@xmath22 } ( @xmath34 ) by fitting the eigenvalues @xmath28 as @xmath35 in @xmath30 . since finding the stability of the energies against @xmath27 in noisy data may suffer from uncontrollable biases , the result could be quite subjective . in order to avoid such biases",
    ", one should impose some concrete criteria to judge the stability as will be explained in later sections and select only those data which satisfy the criteria .",
    "after the separation of the states , we need to distinguish a possible resonance state from nk scattering states by the volume dependence of each state .",
    "it is expected that the energies of resonance states have small volume dependence , while the energies of nk scattering states are expected to scale as @xmath36 according to the relative momentum @xmath37 between n and k on a finite periodic lattice , provided that the nk interaction is weak and negligible which is indeed the case for the leading order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "although the variational method is powerful for extracting the energy spectrum , one can obtain only part of the information on the spectral weights @xmath38 . in order to extract the spectral weights , we also perform constrained double exponential fits using the energies from the variational method as inputs .",
    "we carry out simulations on four different sizes of lattices , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with 2900 , 2900 , 1950 and 950 gauge configurations using the standard plaquette ( wilson ) gauge action at @xmath39 and the wilson quark action .",
    "the hopping parameters for the quarks are @xmath40=@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which correspond to the current quark masses @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively in the unit of mev  @xcite .",

    "we adopt the following two operators used in ref .",

    "we note here that the baryonic correlators have the spinor indices , which we omit in the paper , and they contain the propagations of both the positive and negative parity particles . for the parity projection",
    ", we simply multiply the correlators by @xmath69 and extract the contributions proportional to @xmath70 from the negative - parity and positive - parity particles , respectively .",
    "we fix the source operator @xmath71 on @xmath72 plane to reduce the effect of the dirichlet boundary on @xmath73 plane  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the operators @xmath74 as sink operators , which is summed over all space to project out the zero - momentum states .",
    "we finally calculate @xmath75    using two independent operators , we can extract the first _ two _ states , namely the lowest and the next - lowest states .",
    "the lowest state is considered to be the `` lowest '' nk scattering state . in order to extract a possible resonance state with controlled systematic errors ,",
    "we need to choose the physical volume of the lattice in an appropriate range .",
    "if we choose @xmath76 to be too large , the resonance state becomes heavier than the 2nd - lowest nk scattering state whose energy is naively expected to scale as @xmath77 according to the spatial lattice extent @xmath76 . in this case",
    "we need to extract the 3rd state using a @xmath78 correlation matrix , which requires more computational time .",
    "the energy difference between the lowest and the next - lowest nk scattering states @xmath79 , for example , ranges from 180 mev to 860 mev in @xmath80 . taking into account that @xmath11 lies about 100 mev above the nk threshold , we take 3.5 fm as the upper limit of @xmath76 .",
    "on the other hand , if we choose @xmath76 too small , unwanted finite - volume artifacts from the finite sizes of particles become non - negligible .",
    "it is however difficult to estimate the lower limit of @xmath76 , because the finite - volume effect is rather uncontrollable .",
    "we shall take the spatial extents @xmath81 at @xmath82 as a trial .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions in all directions for the gauge field , whereas we impose periodic boundary conditions on the spatial directions and the dirichlet boundary condition on the temporal direction for the quark field in order to avoid possible contaminations from those propagating beyond the boundary at @xmath73 in ( anti)periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since the source of possible contaminations is peculiar to the pentaquark and has not been properly noticed in previous studies , it is worthwhile to dwell on this problem for a moment .",
    "let us denote the correlators in the pentaquark channel with periodic / antiperiodic boundary conditions and dirichlet boundary conditions as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . inserting complete set of states",
    "these correlators read @xmath85 where the states @xmath86 are the eigenstates with energies @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 respectively .",
    "@xmath91 is the state which corresponds to the dirichlet boundary condition and @xmath92 is the factor which represents the @xmath93 sign with antiperiodic boundary condition .",
    "the factor @xmath92 is equal to @xmath94 when @xmath95 contains an even(odd ) number of valence quarks . it should be noted that the up , down , and strange quark numbers @xmath96 for the state @xmath97 are restricted to zero since all the quark fields @xmath98 are set to zero in dirichlet boundary condition , while there is no restriction in the quark sector for the states @xmath95 which appear in periodic / antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "this means that the following states can contribute in the correlators @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the antiparticle states of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the correlators have the contributions in the long range limit , @xmath104 in fig .  [ hadronic_corr ]",
    ", we give a schematic picture of the contributions to the correlators .",
    "the first two terms in eq.([cpap ] ) are the contributions from the five quark states as given in diagram ( a ) .",
    "the third , the fourth and the fifth terms in eq.([cpap ] ) which correspond to diagrams ( c),(d ) and ( b ) are hadronic contributions which propagate beyond the boundary .",
    "schematic figure for the explanation on the possible contaminations of the particles propagating over the temporal boundary . @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the interpolating operators and their arguments are the distances from the source point .",
    "@xmath105 is a generic hadronic operator , which creates and annihilates the particles which can not decay in quenched qcd .",
    "the wave lines represent the propagations of states .",
    "resonance states like @xmath11 are represented by `` 5q '' in the figure , as well as nk scattering states .",
    "_ the five - quark state can dissociate into forward - propagating nucleon ( kaon ) and backward - propagating kaon ( nucleon ) .",
    "_ ]    as a result , the correlation @xmath107 inevitably contains unwanted contributions such as @xmath108 in this case , the effective mass plot approaches @xmath109 below the nk threshold as @xmath27 is increased . on the other hand , the contributions corresponding to diagrams ( c),(d ) and ( b ) do not exist with dirichlet boundary conditions ( eq.([cd ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , we find that it would be safest to impose the dirichlet boundary condition on the temporal direction , since no quark can go over the boundary on t=0 in the temporal direction . although the boundary is transparent for the particles composed only by gluons ; _ i.e. _ glueballs , due to the periodicity of the gauge action , it would be however safe to neglect these gluonic particles going beyond the boundary since these particles are rather heavy .",
    "then , the correlation @xmath110 mainly contains only such terms ( ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ hadronic_corr ] ) as @xmath111 with @xmath112 the weight factor and @xmath113 the eigenenergy of @xmath114-th state in positive / negative parity channel , respectively .",
    "one sees that one can now apply the prescription mentioned in the last section .",
    "one may wonder if these contaminations can be discarded with the parity projection of the correlators by taking linear combinations with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "this method indeed works for ordinary three quark states where one can single out one of the two contributions diagram ( x ) and ( y ) in fig .",
    "[ hadronic_corr ] .",
    "however even if one takes such linear combinations , one can not make the contributions from diagram ( c ) seen in eq.([cpap ] ) cancel out as opposed to the contributions from diagram ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "it is because of the fact that the factor @xmath92 for the contribution ( c ) is always equal to @xmath115 .",
    "( we note here that we can avoid these contaminations using the `` averaged quark propagator ''  @xcite . )",
    "some of the previous lattice qcd studies on @xmath11 adopted a parity projection method using the combination with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we stress that one should in principle be careful whether the result is free from the contamination owing to the boundary condition which is peculiar to the pentaquark and can mimic a fake plateau in the propagator .    after obtaining the energy spectrum ,",
    "we carry out a study of the spectral weight for @xmath40=@xmath44 . introducing two smeared operators @xmath116 , @xmath117 we compute the following correlators @xmath118 from which we extract the spectral weights using a constrained double exponential fit .",
