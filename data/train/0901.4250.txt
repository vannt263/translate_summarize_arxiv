    "already in the early days of supersymmetry it was realized that there exists an intimate relation between extended supersymmetry and complex geometry , when applied to ( non - linear ) @xmath1-models @xcite . from a more modern perspective - inspired by flux compactifications - the two - dimensional @xmath0 = ( 2,2 )",
    "@xmath1-model is part of the stringy toolbox to study type ii superstrings on internal manifolds without r - r fluxes .",
    "the geometrical data to describe this type of manifold is given by a metric , a closed 3-form and two complex structures .",
    "the complex structures are covariantly constant and the metric is hermitian with respect to both complex structures .",
    "this type of geometry was originally called bihermitian geometry @xcite , but since the birth of generalized complex geometry @xcite it is usually referred to as generalized khler geometry .",
    "the conditions on the metric , the 3-form and the complex structures can be solved in terms of a single real potential , the so - called generalized khler potential , from which we can determine the metric and 3-form .",
    "+ in order to make the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) manifest , to simplify the analysis and to expose the geometrical structure of the target space it is useful to formulate the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) non - linear @xmath1-model in terms of an @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superspace .",
    "the most general lagrangian density one can write down in @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superspace consists of ( the superspace integration ) of a real scalar potential , as can be seen from dimensional analysis .",
    "this scalar potential is a function of three types of @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) scalar superfield ( chiral , twisted chiral and semi - chiral ) and is naturally interpreted as the generalized khler potential , as we will explain in the first part of section [ sec2 ] . + it is well known that the spectrum of type ii superstrings also contains open string states describing the excitations of d - branes to which the open string is attached . therefore , it is a cromulent question whether we can use these two - dimensional @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) @xmath1-models to describe the propagation of an open string in ( generalized ) khler backgrounds with ( supersymmetric ) d - branes .",
    "we can invoke the effects of a ( supersymmetric ) d - brane quite easily by noticing that the boundary conditions of the open string will break half of the supersymmetry to an @xmath0 = 2 boundary supersymmetry . to have a manifestly supersymmetric description of the boundary conditions for an open string we need to introduce an @xmath0 = 2 boundary superspace .",
    "the picture for exclusively chiral or exclusively twisted chiral superfields was developed in @xcite , which lead to type b and respectively type a branes on khler target spaces .",
    "the picture for chiral and twisted chiral superfields was successfully unraveled in @xcite and is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "a brief review of the picture will be given in section [ sec2 ] , followed by some examples of d - branes wrapped on ( generalized ) khler geometries .",
    "+ in the third section we start by discussing the main philosophy of t - dualization in the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superspace formalism , which basically corresponds to a legendre transformation interchanging chiral and twisted chiral superfields .",
    "the natural follow - up question is whether we can perform duality transformations in the presence of boundaries .",
    "we will point out that it is possible , though there are some subtleties to take into account . knowing these subtleties allowed us to come up with a systematic procedure to construct coisotropic d - branes via t - dualization of a chiral superfield @xcite",
    ". we will conclude section [ sec3 ] with some explicit examples .",
    "let us start by giving a quick review of the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) non - linear @xmath1-model in an @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superspace .",
    "the world - sheet bosonic coordinates are given by ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , while we also introduce four grassmann coordinates ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and associated super - covariant derivatives ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) . the most general action in @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superspace reads on dimensional grounds , @xmath11 where the lagrange density @xmath12 is a real function of complex @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) scalar superfields",
    ". a closer look at the number of degrees of freedom of the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superfields indicates that there are too many degrees of freedom in comparison with an @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) @xmath1-model in @xmath0 = ( 1,1 ) superspace . in order to eliminate some of the degrees of freedom",
    "we should impose constraints on the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) scalar superfields .",
    "we can distinguish three different types of constraint , leading to three different types of superfield : chiral , twisted chiral and semi - chiral superfields .",
    "however , in the remainder of the note we shall mostly focus on the first two types : + @xmath13 chiral superfields @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath13 twisted chiral superfields @xmath18 , @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath13 semi - chiral superfields @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xmath24 introducing these constraints makes it also possible to investigate the dynamics of the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) @xmath1-models , which is clearly not present in action eq .",
    "( [ 1eq1 ] ) .",
    "the proper way to see the dynamics is by reducing the action eq .",
    "( [ 1eq1 ] ) to @xmath0 = ( 1,1 ) superspace by integrating out @xmath9 and @xmath10 . comparing the resulting action with the most general @xmath0 = ( 1,1 ) superspace action = ( 1,1 ) superspace action can e.g. be found in @xcite . ]",
    ", we can read off the expressions for the metric @xmath25 and the 2-form potential @xmath26 in terms of @xmath27 . in case of chiral and twisted chiral fields ,",
    "we get the following expressions , @xmath28 and all other components is a shorthanded notation for @xmath29 , etc . ]",
    "vanish . from these relations",
    "it is obvious that @xmath27 plays the role of the ( generalized ) khler potential .",
    "+ let us now give some examples of four - dimensional target spaces that can be parameterized by chiral and/or twisted chiral superfields .",
    "the easier target spaces are the torus @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the disk with a singular boundary .",
    "both target spaces can be parameterized by two chiral superfields , two twisted chiral superfields , or one chiral and one twisted chiral superfield .",
    "a third example is the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model on @xmath33 , can also be seen as the hopf surface @xmath34 . ] which is the only @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) wzw model that can be parameterized without the use of semi - chiral superfields @xcite , in which case it is parameterized by one chiral and one twisted chiral superfield .",
    "the target space is characterized by a metric and a torsion .",
    "this concludes our discussion of a closed string propagating on ( generalized ) khler backgrounds .",
    "+ next , we will discuss the propagation of an open string in the presence of a d - brane to which the open string is attached .",
    "invoking the presence of a d - brane comes down to introducing a boundary that breaks the re - parametrization invariance along the open string and half of the supersymmetries on the world - sheet . in practice",
    "it is sufficient to recombine the supercovariant derivatives ( @xmath35 ) into the following linear combinations , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the directions which remain invariant . in the next step",
    "we rewrite the superfield constraints eqs .",
    "( [ 1eq2 ] ) and ( [ 1eq3 ] ) in terms of these new supercovariant derivatives to arrive at @xmath0 = 2 boundary superfields : + @xmath13 chiral boundary superfields @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath39 @xmath13 twisted chiral boundary superfields @xmath18 , @xmath40 @xmath41 these manipulations form the basic procedure to arrive at the @xmath0 = 2 boundary superspace formalism . finally we write down the most general @xmath0 = 2 boundary superspace action with chiral and twisted chiral superfields as , @xmath42 where @xmath27 is the ( real ) bulk potential and @xmath43 the ( real ) boundary potential , and where we have to integrate out @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we can describe the local embedding of a d - brane by examining the boundary conditions of the open string attached to the d - brane .",
    "we therefore vary the action eq .",
    "( [ 1eq9 ] ) with respect to the chiral and twisted chiral superfields , after integrating out the derivatives @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "this variation will yield a bulk term and a boundary term .",
    "the bulk term will describe the propagation of the bulk of the open string and contains information about the target space geometry on which the string is propagating .",
    "the boundary term describes the propagation of the endpoints of the open string and thus contains information about the local d - brane geometry . for a complete analysis",
    "we refer to @xcite . in this note",
    "we shall limit ourselves to four - dimensional target spaces , parameterized by chiral and/or twisted chiral superfields , to see how the analysis works in practice .",
    "+ in order for the boundary variation to vanish it is necessary to impose appropiate boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions are determined by the bulk potential @xmath27 , the boundary potential @xmath43 and the constraints on the boundary superfields . for the chiral superfield",
    "the boundary variation allows us to impose a dirichlet or a neumann boundary condition , but the boundary superfield constraints imply the same type of boundary condition for the superfield and its complex conjugated .",
    "thus , we can impose two dirichlet boundary conditions or two neumann boundary conditions for one chiral boundary superfield .",
    "this means that we can have three different types of branes ( so - called b - branes ) for a four - dimensional target space parameterized by purely chiral superfields : d0- , d2- and d4-branes .",
    "the boundary constraints for a twisted chiral superfield imply that every dirichlet condition should be accompanied by an associated neumann boundary condition .",
    "however , in the case of two ( or more ) twisted chiral superfields , one can impose four independent neumann boundary conditions .",
    "thus , on a four - dimensional target space parameterized by purely twisted chiral superfields we can wrap two different types of brane ( so - called a - branes ) : lagrangian d2@xmath47-branes and ( space - filling ) coisotropic d4@xmath48-branes . + in the case of a four - dimensional target space parameterized by a chiral and a twisted chiral superfield , we will always have one dirichlet and one neumann boundary condition for the twisted chiral field and two dirichlet or two neumann boundary conditions for the chiral field .",
    "hence , we encounter two different types of brane : d1-branes and d3-branes .",
    "now , we are able to give an overview table with the different possible d - branes wrapping a subspace of a ( generalized ) khler geometry and preserving half of the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) world - sheet supersymmetry ,    .possible d - brane configurations for a four - dimensional target space [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + in @xcite we constructed a d3-brane on @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition of the d3-brane on @xmath30 is given by , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in the example of @xmath34 we choose the following dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 $ ] . ] , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "for simplicity we defined @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "both types of d3-brane are non - trivial embeddings satisfying all consistency requirements and made possible due to the presence of a @xmath61 gauge field on the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "t - duality is another important feature of type ii superstring models and it is therefore interesting to see how t - duality can be made manifest in the @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) non - linear @xmath1-models . like in the previous section",
    "we prefer to work in @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superspace , where a t - duality corresponds to a legendre - transformation interchanging different types of @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superfield @xcite .",
    "+ we will first summarize the basic procedure to dualize a chiral or a twisted chiral superfield in the absence of boundaries . in order to dualize on the level of the action we have to assume that the model in eq .",
    "( [ 1eq1 ] ) exhibits an isometry of the form @xmath62 .",
    "this isometry then needs to be gauged on the world - sheet , which demands the introduction of a real @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) gauge superfield @xmath63 to preserve the ( local ) isometry .",
    "since the gauge field @xmath63 should not introduce extra degrees of freedom , we should impose that @xmath63 is purely gauge .",
    "this can be done through a complex @xmath0 = ( 2,2 ) superfield ( serving as a lagrange - multiplier ) imposing that the field strengths derived from the gauge field @xmath63 vanish .",
    "the gauged khler potential together with the lagrange multiplier terms form the complete first order potential . if we integrate out the lagrange multipliers from this first order action , we retrieve the original model .",
    "to arrive at the dual model we need to integrate out the gauge field and the dual superfield @xmath64 will be expressed in terms of superspace derivates of the lagrange - multiplier .",
    "performing this philosophy we can dualize a chiral field to a twisted chiral field and vice versa .",
    "let us conclude the discussion of t - dualization in the absence of boundaries by giving some concrete four - dimensional examples .",
    "the torus @xmath30 parameterized by a chiral and a twisted chiral superfield can be dualized to a dual torus @xmath30 parameterized by two chiral superfields or two twisted chiral superfields . the wzw model on the hopf - surface",
    "@xmath34 parameterized by a chiral and a twisted chiral superfield can be dualized to @xmath31 parameterized by two chiral superfields or two twisted chiral superfields .",
    "+ the next step is to translate this general philosophy to @xmath0 = 2 boundary superspace and to investigate which kind of d - brane configuration we get after t - dualization .",
    "an initial analysis of duality transformations in the presence of boundaries can be found in @xcite .",
    "there it was already realized that one should pay extra attention to the boundary term in order to get consistent dual boundary conditions .",
    "first of all we might want to rewrite the boundary potential such that the symmetry of the form @xmath62 remains present at the boundary , albeit not necessarily explicitly .",
    "to arrive at the correct and consistent boundary conditions , we might also need to add extra terms to the boundary action .",
    "this enabled us for instance to dualize a space - filling b - brane on a khler target space to a lagrangian a - brane on the dual khler target space , and a lagrangian d1-brane on @xmath65 to a space - filling d2-brane on the dual @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , starting from a coisotropic d4-brane on a four - dimensional hyper - khler target space we were able to construct a d3-brane on a generalized khler target space via dualization .",
    "in @xcite we improved the dualization method in the presence of boundaries by deriving two identities eqs .",
    "( 6.14 ) and ( 6.15 ) that made it possible to introduce the correct boundary terms . with these two identities",
    "all dualizations interchanging chiral and twisted chiral superfields can be performed .",
    "+ we will not dwell too long on the general philosophy of t - dualization in superspace and try to clarify it by reviewing some practical examples .",
    "we shall focus again on the d3-branes constructed on @xmath30 and @xmath34 , as discussed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "it will become clear through these examples that the parameters describing the d3-brane embedding determine the characteristics of the dual brane .",
    "let us start by dualizing the chiral superfield .",
    "looking at the dirichlet boundary conditions eqs .",
    "( [ 1eq10 ] ) and ( [ 1eq11 ] ) we see that the dirichlet boundary condition preserves the symmetry of the form @xmath66 if @xmath67 , and @xmath68 respectively and that one of the d3-brane directions is wrapped along the @xmath66 direction .",
    "when dualizing along this direction we expect a ( lagrangian ) d2-brane in the dual theory .",
    "for the d3-brane on @xmath69 we find as the dual model a lagrangian d2-brane wrapped along one direction in @xmath32 and one direction in @xmath65 , where the ( quantized ) wrapping angle is given by @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath70 , and @xmath71 respectively , then the dirichlet boundary conditions eqs .",
    "( [ 1eq10 ] ) and ( [ 1eq11 ] ) violate the symmetry of the form @xmath66 .",
    "the d3-brane is wrapped differently and when dualizing along the direction @xmath66 we expect a d4-brane in the dual theory . in the case of the ( dual )",
    "@xmath30 the constructed space - filling coisotropic d4-brane is a generalization of the coisotropic d4-brane described in @xcite .",
    "the coisotropic d4-brane on @xmath31 is a quite interesting result , since it is a first example of a coisotropic d - brane on a non - hyper - khler target space . from a target space perspective",
    "the dual target space should allow for a ( second ) complex structure @xmath72 , which does not commute with the complex structures @xmath73 characterizing the target space geometry .",
    "on the world - volume of the coisotropic d4-brane lives a @xmath61 fieldstrength that can be given in terms of the complex structures and the metric ( see e.g. eq .  ( 4.61 ) in @xcite ) . + in our case , the models also exhibit the isometry @xmath74 in the bulk for the twisted chiral superfield .",
    "we were able to dualize the d3-branes along this isometry direction , leaving us with dual models completely parameterized by two chiral superfields . in the case of the d3-brane on @xmath30",
    "we can distinguish once more two different cases , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in the first case the d3-brane is wrapped along the direction we dualize ( i.e. @xmath77 ) and so we expect a d2-brane in the dual model .",
    "the d2-brane is now wrapping a holomorphic 2-cycle with a non - trivial @xmath61 bundle on its world - volume .",
    "the dualization on the level of the action is rather subtle for this case and for details we refer to @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the d - brane is no longer wrapped along the dualization direction and we find a d4-brane wrapping a holomorphic 4-cycle with a non - trivial @xmath61 bundle on its world - volume .",
    "the constructed d3-brane on @xmath69 can only be dualized to a d4-brane wrapping a holomorphic 4-cycle on @xmath31 with a non - trivial @xmath61-bundle on its world - volume .",
    "+   + besides the dualization of only one type of superfield , we would also like to briefly consider here the dualization of a chiral and twisted chiral pair to a semi - chiral supermultiplet @xcite .",
    "the underlying gauge structure and t - duality transformations were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we started the analysis of dualizing a chiral and twisted chiral pair to a semi - chiral supermultiplet in the presence of boundaries . starting from the torus @xmath30 parameterized by a chiral / twisted chiral pair and the d3-brane given in eq .",
    "( [ 1eq10 ] ) , we were able to dualize the d3-brane to a lagrangian - like d2-brane and a coisotropic - like d4-brane , depending on the embedding parameters of the d3-brane .",
    "this dualization allowed us to have a quick look at the possible boundary conditions for semi - chiral superfields and initiated the study of semi - chiral boundary superfields , which will be continued in @xcite . in this upcoming paper",
    ", we will also consider the dualization of @xmath31 parameterized by a chiral / twisted chiral pair to @xmath34 parameterized by a semi - chiral multiplet . through this dualization it is possible to construct a lagrangian - like d2-brane and a coisotropic - like d4-brane on @xmath34 , starting from a d3-brane on @xmath78 .",
    "in this note we briefly discussed a manifestly @xmath0 = 2 supersymmetric world - sheet description of d - branes wrapping subspaces of bihermitian geometries with commuting complex structures . for this type of geometries",
    ", the target space is parameterized by a set of chiral and/or twisted chiral superfields .",
    "we gave some four - dimensional examples parameterized by a chiral and a twisted chiral superfield to clarify the general formalism developed in @xcite and discussed in @xcite . building on the results of @xcite we explored the subtleties in dualizing one of the superfields when boundaries are present .",
    "this exploration led to a systematic method to construct coisotropic d - branes via dualization of the chiral superfield , which allowed us to construct a coisotropic d4-brane on a non - hyper - khler target space .",
    "in @xcite we also dualized the chiral / twisted chiral pair to one semi - chiral multiplet , which gave a brief taste of the @xmath0 = 2 boundary superspace description of d - branes on generalized khler manifolds parameterized by semi - chiral superfields .",
    "this will be discussed in depth in @xcite and reviewed in @xcite .",
    "+ in a later stage , it would be interesting to check the stability of the constructed d - branes by studying the quantum conformal invariance of the two - dimensional models using a @xmath0 = 2 boundary superspace approach , as was done in @xcite . studying the quantum conformal invariance of these models will also allow us to investigate the number of target space supersymmetries preserved by the constructed d - branes .",
