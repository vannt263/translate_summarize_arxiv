    "in the near future , there will be large amount of data for orbitally excited heavy baryons . understanding them",
    "will extend our ability in the application of qcd @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study their masses by using heavy quark and large @xmath1 expansions .",
    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite is a useful method to deal with hadrons containing a single heavy quark .",
    "many features of heavy mesons and heavy baryons have been analyzed by using hqet . in @xmath4 limit where @xmath5 is the heavy quark mass , heavy quark spin decouples from the strong interaction and",
    "the hadron respects heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry ( hqs ) . to the order of @xmath6 , the breaking of the hqs occurs .",
    "the excited heavy baryon masses can be expressed as @xmath7 where the parameter @xmath2 is independent of heavy quark spin and flavor , and describes mainly the contributions of the light degrees of freedom in the baryon . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hadron state of velocity @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the renormalization factor .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 should be determined by some nonperturbative methods .    at this stage",
    ", we use large @xmath1 expansion to analyze the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "large @xmath1 qcd has been developed to study the nonperturbative nature of hadrons @xcite . in the large @xmath1 limit",
    ", baryons can be treated as the bound state of infinite number of valence quarks .",
    "witten described this system in the hartree - fock picture and gave @xmath1 counting rules for the meson - baryon scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "dashen , jenkins and manohar ( djm ) found that there is a light quark spin - flavor symmetry for the ground state baryon sector in the large @xmath1 limit by deriving a set of consistency conditions ( which was first derived by gervais and sakita @xcite ) for pion - baryon coupling constants according to the @xmath1 counting rules @xcite .",
    "it was shown later that this symmetry can be observed in the hartree - fock picture @xcite .",
    "namely , the s - wave states of low spin in the baryon multiplet are spin independent , while the states with spin of order @xmath14 are considerably modified by spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "orbitally excited baryons have also been studied [ 8 - 11 ] .",
    "as far as the baryon masses are concerned , ref.@xcite derived the consistency conditions of the strong couplings of the excited baryons to pions analogous to that of refs.@xcite .",
    "and goity @xcite made the analysis for the excited light baryons in the hartree - fock picture .",
    "further development was made in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will adopt the hartree - fock picture to study @xmath2 .",
    "one problem of our method is the validity of the large @xmath1 application .",
    "it is actually @xmath15 , which is @xmath16 in the real world , that will be taken as a large number , because heavy quark and the excited light quark are distinguished . in the case of excited light baryons ,",
    "the number which is taken to be large is @xmath17 . and it seems that the large @xmath1 approach describes the spectrum well @xcite .",
    "this leads us to generalize the method to the excited heavy baryons , considering that the theoretical framework is interesting and our knowledge about non - perturbative hqet is poor .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "excited heavy baryons are classified according to the large @xmath1 spin - flavor structure of light degrees of freedom . in sec.iii ,",
    "leading spin - flavor symmetry breaking operators involving spin - orbit , spin - isospin , and spin - orbit - isospin correlations are introduced and their matrix elements are calculated in the basis given in sec.ii .",
    "the numerical results are obtained .",
    "a summary is given in sec.iv .",
    "the quantum numbers which describe the hadrons are angular momentum @xmath18 and isospin @xmath19 . for the heavy hadrons , because of hqs , the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath20 becomes a good quantum number . in this case",
    ", the excited hadron spectrum shows the degeneracy of pair of states which are related to each other by hqs . for the baryons ,",
    "the light degrees of freedom looks like a collection of @xmath17 light quarks with one of them being excited .",
    "experimentally , some of the excited charmed baryons have been discovered @xcite . among them ,",
    "the lowest lying pair of states are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "they are of isospin @xmath23 . in the constituent picture , the total spin of the light quarks",
    "@xmath24 is also zero @xcite .",
    "this guides us to focus on the symmetric representation of the @xmath17 light quarks .",
    "[ tableaux](a ) shows the young s tableaux of symmetric representation of the @xmath17 quarks .",
    "the spin - flavor decomposition is the same as that of the ground state heavy baryons @xcite with the rule @xmath25 for the non - strange baryons . in this case",
    ", it should be noted that one of the light quarks is orbitally excited with @xmath26 . in real world",
    "@xmath1 is fixed to be 3 , so there are only two light quarks in the heavy baryon , and one of which is excited .",
    "the spin - flavor structure of these two light quarks is quite simple , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by assuming @xmath29 .",
    "all the possible states of excited heavy baryons are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the first two are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also give out the mixed representation of the @xmath17 light quarks in fig .",
    "[ tableaux](b ) and table [ table2 ] .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath30-spin which is defined by @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath30 is a good quantum number whenever there is a light quark spin - flavor symmetry which is true for baryons in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the symmetric representation corresponds to @xmath32 , and the mixed one to @xmath33 . from tables",
    "[ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , we see that unlike the case of the excited light baryons @xcite , there is no mixing between the states belonging to different @xmath30 for the case of excited heavy baryon .",
    "since there are only two young boxes for light quarks , it is impossible to have the same @xmath34 pair with different @xmath30 .",
    "with the classification of the excited heavy baryons described in the last section , their spectrum , especially the mass splittings among them will be studied by large @xmath1 method in the heavy quark limit . if we really go to the large @xmath1 limit , at the leading order ( @xmath35 ) , we will get a trivial result , that is all the finitely excited heavy baryons have the same mass as that of the ground state heavy baryon .",
    "this is simply because there are infinite number of light quarks , which are not excited , in both excited and ground state baryons .",
    "compared to their contribution , the finitely excited quarks are negligible .",
    "such a conclusion is not useful practically , because in real world , there is only one quark in the core .",
    "interesting point of recent approaches [ 5 - 7 ] is that the mass splittings due to the spin - flavor structure can be analyzed by large @xmath1 method .",
    "let us go to more details of large @xmath1 method .",
    "one of the essential point of this method is the @xmath1 counting rules of the relevant feynman diagrams . in the hartree - fock picture of the baryons ,",
    "the @xmath1 counting rules require us to include many - body interactions in the analysis , instead of including only one- or two - body interactions . however , a large part of these interactions are spin - flavor irrelevant .",
    "namely , this part contributes in the order @xmath35 universally to all the baryons with different spin - flavor structure .",
    "the many - body hamiltonians related to the spin - flavor structure which involve orbital angular momentum @xmath36 give @xmath37 contribution .",
    "it is desirable to adopt a working assumption that they can be treated perturbatively .",
    "we use the following operators which are used in @xcite to analyze @xmath2 , @xmath38 the first one @xmath39 is one - body hamiltonian , while the others are two - body hamiltonians .",
    "@xmath40 are the generators of the spin - flavor symmetry group su(4 ) , given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the spin and isospin matrices , respectively .",
    "such structure gives coherent addition over @xmath15 core quarks .",
    "the first @xmath44 in @xmath45 acts on the excited quark , the other @xmath40 s on the @xmath15 unexcited light quarks , namely the core quarks . in our case , all the operators must be understood as the ones acting on the light degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the higher order many - body hamiltonian which contains more factor of @xmath40 can be reduced to those given in eq.(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the contributions to the baryon masses due to these hamiltonians are obtained by calculating the baryonic matrix elements .",
    "the matrix elements of these operators between the states of light quarks which specify the states of excited heavy baryons are given as follows analogous to ref.@xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the isospin of the core quarks .",
    "in real world ( @xmath48 ) , there is only one quark in the core ( @xmath49 so @xmath47 is always equal to @xmath50 .    with these matrix elements",
    ", we can express the excited heavy baryon mass @xmath51 up to the zeroth order of @xmath6 and @xmath3 as follows .",
    "@xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 s are the coefficients which will be determined by experiments and @xmath56 is the leading contribution to @xmath2 which preserves the spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "the numerical results are also given on the right hand side of table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "current data are @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this results in @xmath58  gev by taking @xmath59  gev and @xmath60  gev .",
    "more experimental data are needed to fix the unknown coefficients . in the work for the light excited baryons @xcite",
    ", @xmath61 yields the same value for a given tower so it can be absorbed into the leading contribution . in our case , as can be seen in table [ table1 ] , @xmath61 gets different values in symmetric representation while in mixed representation it gives the same value for all the states of the tower . comparing with the mixed representation , mass splittings of the symmetric states due to @xmath45 and @xmath62",
    "are opposite in sign and three times smaller except for @xmath63 .",
    "this is due to the effect of different isospin . in the future",
    ", these coefficients can be fitted after obtaining the three masses of the states with quantum numbers @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the symmetric representation .",
    "it would be a check for the validity of our method , if the results for @xmath53 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are in the reasonable range as that for @xmath54 .",
    "we have analyzed the mass splittings of orbitally excited heavy baryons in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath3 expansions . in heavy quark limit , heavy quark spin decouples and the baryon",
    "is described by light degrees of freedom . at the zeroth order of @xmath3 , the light quark spin - flavor symmetry breaking effects which involve one 1-body operator and three 2-body operators have been calculated , and they are parameterized by several coefficients which need more data on excited charmed baryons to be fitted .",
