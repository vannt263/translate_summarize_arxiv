    "designing control strategies directly from network topologies is challenging , which contributes to an efficient manipulation of networks and a better understanding of the nature of systems .",
    "this requires research of the interplay between network topologies and system dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable efforts have been made along this line in the multi - agent literature to understand how communication topological structures are related to controllability , which is also the focus here , where destructive nodes are defined to characterize controllability - relevant topologies .",
    "multi - agent controllability was formulated under a leader - follower framework in which the influence over network is achieved by exerting control inputs upon leaders @xcite .",
    "a system is controllable if followers can be steered to proper positions to form any desirable configuration by regulating the movement of leaders .",
    "the earliest necessary and sufficient algebraic condition was presented in @xcite , which was expressed in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of submatrices of laplacian .",
    "another one was given in @xcite , which related controllability to the existence of a common eigenvalue of the system matrix and the laplacian .",
    "besides , a relationship between controllability and the eigenvectors of laplacian was presented in @xcite , which provided a method of determining leaders from the elements of eigenvectors .",
    "armed with these results , the virtue that leaders should have was characterized from both algebraic and graphical perspectives @xcite .",
    "other algebraic conditions exist in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "recently , a unified protocol design method was proposed for controllability in @xcite .",
    "algebraic conditions lay the foundation for understanding interactions between topological structures and controllability .",
    "previous work has suggested that this issue is quite involved , even for the simplest path graph @xcite .",
    "special topologies were studied first , such as grid graphs @xcite , symmetric structures @xcite , cartesian product networks @xcite , multi - chain topologies @xcite and tree graphs @xcite .",
    "controllability can be fully addressed by analyzing the eigenvectors of laplacian , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it can also be tackled through topological construction which sometimes relates to the partition of graphs .",
    "for example , topologies were designed by using the vanishing coordinates based partition @xcite and an eigenvector based partition @xcite . in particular",
    ", the construction of uncontrollable topologies not only facilitates the design of control strategies but also deepens understanding of controllable ones @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proved , via a proper design of protocols , that the controllability of single - integrator , high - order and generic linear multi - agent systems is uniquely determined by the topology structure of the communication graph @xcite .",
    "the above work guides a further study of this issue .",
    "the topology structures of three kinds of the so - called controllability destructive nodes are discriminated and defined .",
    "each structure depicts a topological relationship of destructive nodes to leader nodes so that leaders can not distinguish the former , and thus destroys the controllability .",
    "moreover , necessary and sufficient graphical conditions are derived by taking advantage of the concept of controllability destructive nodes .",
    "the results exhibit a new method of tackling controllability by which a complete graphical characterization of controllability is given for graphs consisting of five nodes .",
    "consider a set of @xmath0 single integrator agents given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the number of followers and leaders , respectively ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the states of the @xmath6th and @xmath7th agent , respectively .",
    "let @xmath8 act as leaders and be influenced only via external control inputs .",
    "@xmath9 represents the neighboring set of @xmath10 and ` @xmath11 ' denotes the neighboring relation .",
    "the followers are governed by neighbor based rule @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 denote the stack vectors of @xmath4 s , @xmath5 s , respectively .",
    "the information flow between agents is incorporated in a graph @xmath17 which consists of a node set @xmath18 and an edge set @xmath19 with nodes representing agents and edges indicating the interconnections between them .",
    "@xmath20 is the laplacian , where @xmath21 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries @xmath24 the cardinality of @xmath25 under ( [ ui ] ) , the followers dynamics is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is obtained from @xmath28 after deleting the last @xmath3 rows and @xmath3 columns ; @xmath29 consists of the first @xmath2 elements of the deleted columns .",
    "since ( [ ueqfolw ] ) captures the followers dynamics , the controllability of a multi - agent system can be realized through ( [ ueqfolw ] ) .",
    "a path of @xmath22 is a sequence of consecutive edges .",

    "a subgraph is induced from @xmath22 if it is obtained by deleting a subset of nodes and all the edges connecting to those nodes .",
    "an induced subgraph , which is maximal and connected , is said to be a connected component .",
    "controllability can be studied under the assumption that @xmath22 is connected  @xcite .",
    "let agents @xmath32 play leaders role . define @xmath33 then @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the empty set . here to focus on subsequent problem : _ identify a number of nodes so that the topology associated with them destroys the controllability of the whole graph .",

    "<S> in this paper , several necessary and sufficient graphical conditions are derived for the controllability of multi - agent systems by taking advantage of the proposed concept of controllability destructive nodes . </S>",
    "<S> a key step of arriving at this result is the establishment of a relationship between topology structures of the controllability destructive nodes and a specific eigenvector of the laplacian matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the results on double , triple and quadruple controllability destructive nodes constitute a novel approach to study the controllability . in particular , the approach is applied to the graph consisting of five nodes to get a complete graphical characterization of controllability . </S>"
