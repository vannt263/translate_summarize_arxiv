    "the coulomb dissociation method @xcite is now a standard experimental tool as a source of information on radioactive capture processes of astrophysical interest .",
    "it can be shown that the breakup cross sections of a projectile nucleus in the coulomb field of a target is proportional to the cross section for photo - dissociation @xcite .",
    "the radiative capture cross sections can be obtained via detailed balance @xcite .",
    "thus , by measuring the coulomb breakup of nuclear projectiles , specially at high bombarding energies ( @xmath5 mev / nucleon ) , one can obtain information on the radiative capture cross section of interest .",
    "this goal has indeed been achieved in numerous experiments for the study of @xmath6he@xmath7li @xcite , @xmath8c@xmath9c @xcite , @xmath10c@xmath11n @xcite , and @xmath8c@xmath12o @xcite .",
    "more recently , this method has been used exhaustively in the study of the reaction@xmath13be@xmath14b @xcite , considered the most important one for the standard solar model @xcite .    under some circumstances the relation between the coulomb breakup measurements and the radiative capture cross sections of interest is not so straightforward .",
    "first the radiative capture cross sections contain contributions of different electric and magnetic multipolarities which enter with different weights in the coulomb breakup cross sections .",
    "for example , while the radiative e2 capture is very small in the reaction @xmath13be@xmath15b within the solar environment , its contribution is amplified in the coulomb breakup experiments .",
    "separation of the two contributions one depends on the structure model used for the @xmath16b nucleus @xcite . secondly , the nuclear contribution to the breakup has to be separated from the coulomb breakup @xcite .",
    "finally , coulomb reacceleration effects @xcite have to be controlled .    the coulomb reacceleration effects are indeed one of the main concerns in extracting the astrophysical s - factor for the reaction @xmath13be@xmath17b .",
    "these effects are filtered from the data by comparing them with dynamical calculations of coulomb breakup @xcite . due to its relevance for the application of the coulomb dissociation method , it is desirable to study a system where the astrophysical s - factors have been measured directly at the stellar energies and where dynamical effects can be tested . apparently , the breakup of @xmath0f is a good candidate .",
    "the ground state of @xmath18 is loosely - bound ( 600 kev of separation energy into proton + @xmath1o ) and its only excited state is one of the best halo states known sofar in nuclear physics , being bound by only 100 kev . besides , the s - factor for the radiative capture reaction",
    "@xmath19 has been measured down to 200 kev @xcite .",
    "indeed , the breakup of the weakly bound @xmath0f well above the barrier has been considered as an important test of the dynamical breakup mechanism @xcite .",
    "first theoretical analysis of this reaction has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the breakup of @xmath0f into proton + @xmath1o , which would be relevant for the purpose of testing coulomb dynamical effects by a comparison with experimental results .",
    "thus , we do not consider the stripping of the proton from @xmath0f , or the breakup into other channels .",
    "we will only consider two breakup mechanisms : the coulomb and the elastic nuclear breakup ( or diffraction dissociation ) . if the proton and the @xmath1o fragments are measured in coincidence , these are the only two mechanisms of interest .",
    "we restrict our calculation to first order perturbation theory , as we want to learn about the feasibility of such experiments .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to bombarding energies of 65 mev / nucleon , typical of laboratories like ganil / france , gsi / germany , nscl / usa and riken / japan , where previous coulomb dissociation experiments have been carried out .",
    "we show that the coulomb breakup cross sections are too small to allow for a reliable experimental counting rate . also , the reaction is dominated by the elastic nuclear breakup mechanism which is more model dependent than the coulomb breakup .",
    "the details of our calculations are presented in section 2 , where we show that a single particle model is able to explain the astrophysical s - factor for @xmath20 at the lowest energies . in section 3",
    "we present our calculations for coulomb breakup and in section 4 for elastic nuclear breakup .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
