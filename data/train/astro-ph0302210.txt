    "the observational establishment of the extra - galactic origin of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite enlivened the possibility of exploiting grbs for cosmological investigations .",
    "the discovery of grbs at high redshifts ( grb971214 , @xmath4 , @xcite ; grb000131 , @xmath5 , @xcite ) further demonstrated that grbs , like quasars , could be used to study the early universe and in particular the intergalactic medium , the interstellar medium of young galaxies and star - formation in dusty regions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the developments in the grb field thus appear to mirror the early years of quasar astronomy . in both cases ,",
    "astronomers were astonished by the unexpectedly large brilliance . in both cases ,",
    "the fields split into two camps : many who used the objects for cosmology and some who were intrigued by the workings of the central engine .    however , the large luminosity function of quasars precluded their use as a means to determine the geometry of the universe , i.e. for cosmography .",
    "the bewildering diversity of grbs in almost any respect  fluence , peak luminosity  likewise seemed to make them unsuitable for this purpose .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter fks ) presented a complete sample of grbs with good afterglow follow - up and known redshifts .",
    "most afterglows exhibit a steepening , seen either at optical or radio wavelengths , which is expected if the explosion geometry is conical ( opening angle , @xmath6 ) rather than spherical @xcite .",
    "fks interpret the breaks making several simplifying assumptions ( constant ambient density , constant @xmath0-ray conversion efficiency ) and find the surprising result that the seemingly most energetic bursts , @xmath7 ( isotropic - equivalent @xmath0-ray energy release ) , possess the smallest beaming factor , @xmath8 . in that sample ,",
    "the true energy release , @xmath9 , was strongly clustered .",
    "this finding  that grbs are standard - energy explosions",
    " opens up the possibility of using grbs and their afterglows for cosmography .",
    "indeed , in the august 2001 meeting at garching we noted that a hubble diagram constructed from @xmath10 in the fks sample had a smaller scatter ( 0.31dex = 0.79mag ) compared to the dust - corrected @xmath11-band peak magnitude of type ia supernovae ( sne ) as of 1992 ( @xmath12=0.84mag ; see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite presented another grb hubble diagram based on bursts that have two empirical distance indicators : the variability index @xcite and the lag - luminosity correlation @xcite .",
    "the @xcite analysis find a similarly small scatter about a standard candle .",
    "the current distance - indicator sample is small ( 9 sources ) and restricted to grbs with known redshifts and @xmath0-ray observations from _",
    "batse_.    as the experience with previous efforts at cosmography has shown , standard candles whose physics is understood ( e.g. , cepheid variables ) have proved more useful and robust than those which were based on poorly - understood or unphysical phenomena ( e.g. , brightest stars , number counts ) . for type ia sne the physics of the explosion is reasonably well understood .",
    "even so , for type ia sne , it is still important to understand the intrinsic diversity ( i.e. , the distinction between the so - called sub - classification of `` branch normals '' and `` branch peculiars '' ; @xcite ) , to eliminate the large fraction ( @xmath1336% ; @xcite ) of outliers on a sound empirical basis , and thereby increase the precision of the standard candle . ultimately , the distance indicator must be calibrated to high enough accuracy to be competitive with precision cosmological experiments such as wmap @xcite .    as with type ia sne , the apparent constancy of the prompt energy release in grbs is plausible on physical grounds .",
    "furthermore , indications of a constant energy release come from studies of grb afterglows @xcite , a physically distinct emission process from the prompt burst emission .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that complementary afterglow data ( as with photometry and spectroscopy of type ia sne ) would allow us to identify potential families , or sub - classes , in grbs and thus compile more homogeneous samples .",
    "with this motivation and noting that the sample of grbs with quality afterglow data has increased since the fks analysis ( from 17 to 29 ) , we revisit the current state of the grb @xmath10 hubble diagram paying careful attention to the error analysis and identifying potential sub - classes of grbs .",
    "temporal breaks ( secular steepening of a light curve ) have been observed or inferred at optical , x - ray and radio wavelengths in a number of burst afterglows .",
    "when well - sampled broadband imaging exists , these breaks appear to be achromatic or very nearly achromatic .",
    "the ( near ) achromaticity is suggestive of a geometric rather than an emissivity effect ( such as expected from an hydrodynamically evolving synchrotron shock ) .    at present ,",
    "two different geometric pictures are used to interpret the existence of @xmath14 , the characteristic break time between two asymptotic power - law decays ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . in one interpretation ( the `` top hat '' model ) ,",
    "the energy per unit solid angle is constant within some cone with a half - angle opening @xmath6 and falls to zero outside this angle .",
    "the break occurs at a time when the bulk lorentz factor of the shock has slowed to @xmath15 @xcite . in the other interpretation ( the `` universal jet '' or `` structured jet '' model ) , the energy per unit solid angle varies across the face of the jet and the observer lies at an angle @xmath16 from the jet axis @xcite . here",
    ", the break occurs at a time when the bulk lorentz factor of the shock in the direction of the observer slows to @xmath17 .",
    "the present data can not yet distinguish between the top - hat and universal jet models @xcite .",
    "the observational implication of a hybrid of the two models has only recently been explored @xcite .",
    "the inference of @xmath6 or @xmath16 from @xmath18 requires an estimate of the evolution of @xmath19 as a function of observer time .",
    "the dynamical evolution of @xmath19 is theoretically prescribed by the relativistic sedov solution @xcite .",
    "this solution is dependent upon the isotropic - equivalent energy in the shock and the nature of the ambient medium into which the shock propagates for @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy in the prompt burst is measured using the observed fluence , prompt - burst spectrum , and distance to the source .",
    "the nature of the ambient medium is generally assumed to be homogeneous  density as a function of distance @xmath21 from the explosion site as @xmath22or wind - stratified ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "light curves of the more general case @xmath24 have also been explored ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    of the @xmath1330",
    "well - studied grb afterglow to date , there has been only @xmath252 bursts for which a wind - stratified media are strongly favored statistically over homogeneous media ( grb980519 : @xcite and grb011121 : @xcite ) . in the remainder , winds are either excluded ( e.g. , 990510 , @xcite ; 990123 @xcite ) or allowed at similar significances as homogeneous profiles ( e.g. , 980329 ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have reanalysed the afterglow of grb990510 and showed an improved consistency with the wind hypothesis by taking into account a structured jet .",
    "in what follows , we construct a set of geometry - corrected energies for grbs , following from the formalism of fks , under the assumption that the early afterglow propagates into a density of @xmath22 ( we later address the differences when , instead , a wind - stratified medium is assumed ) .",
    "we also assume a top - hat model for the structure of the jet but note the resulting energy determinations are identical under the universal jet model interpretation when the energy per unit solid angle drops as @xmath26 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and referenced therein ) .",
    "following the definitions and notation of fks and @xcite , the value for @xmath10 , the total prompt energy release in a certain bandpass , may be found from : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fluence received in some observed bandpass and @xmath29 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 is a multiplicative correction of order unity relating the observed bandpass to the standard restframe - bandpass , and the opening angle @xmath6 is a function of the jet break time @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the ambient number density @xmath34 ( see equation  1 of fks ) .",
    "since @xmath6 is implicitly a function of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath28 , the value for @xmath10 is a complex function of observables .    expressing all physical quantities in cgs units and making the analogy with astronomical magnitudes ( distance modulus @xmath35 $ ] ) , we rearrange equation [ eq : egamma ] to give , @xmath36 + 2.5 \\log_{10 } e_\\gamma - 5 \\log_{10 }   \\frac{{\\rm cm}}{10\\,{\\rm pc } } , \\label{eq : dm}\\ ] ] where the dm is the `` apparent grb distance modulus . ''",
    "assuming that the total energy output is constant ( @xmath37 ) from burst to burst , equation  [ eq : dm ] becomes , @xmath38 + { \\rm zp } , \\label{eq : dm1}\\ ] ] with the zeropoint zp @xmath39 foe ) .",
    "the unit `` foe '' equals @xmath40 erg .",
    "the variance of @xmath10 is a direct measure of the accuracy with which @xmath10 can be used for cosmographic purposes .",
    "the most direct method to estimate the variance on @xmath10 is to undertake a simultaneous analysis of the afterglow data and prompt burst emission to determine @xmath41 and @xmath10 . with this direct approach",
    "we do not have to worry about hidden correlations between different quantities .",
    "another approach is to carry out a simple error propagation of equation [ eq : egamma ] .",
    "the approach is straightforward but does require the assumption that there is no covariance in the _ measurement _ of @xmath28 and the inference of @xmath6 .",
    "we justify this assumption by noting that @xmath41 is obtained from afterglow measurements whereas @xmath28 derives from the prompt emission ",
    "two very different phenomena .",
    "there could well be global correlations between the prompt burst emission and afterglow emission ( e.g. , the brightest bursts may be associated with bright afterglow ) but we see no reason why our inference of @xmath41 should be _ observationally _ correlated to @xmath28 , beyond the small mathematical dependence of @xmath41 upon @xmath10 ; see equation 1 of @xcite ) . adopting this approach toward variance estimation , we find the fractional error on the @xmath10 measurement from , @xmath42 +      c_{\\theta_{\\rm jet } } \\left [         \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{n}}{n}\\right)^2 +        \\left(\\frac{3\\ , \\sigma_{t_{\\rm jet}}}{t_{\\rm jet}}\\right)^2\\right ] ,   \\label{eq : fracerror}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath43 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the error in the @xmath31-correction ( @xmath44 ) is given by equation  8 of @xcite and the error on the fluence ( @xmath45 ) is estimated from the prompt grb observations .",
    "the errors on density ( @xmath46 ) and the jet - break time ( @xmath47 ) are found from afterglow modeling .",
    "again , we have assumed that the _ measurements _ of the four observables are uncorrelated .",
    "the error on the apparent grb dm is . if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 , implying that the fractional error on @xmath10 can be easily dominated by uncertainties in the @xmath31-correction and @xmath28 .",
    "in fks we adopted a value of @xmath50 @xmath51 for the circumburst density for all bursts .",
    "one clear step toward improving the @xmath10 measurements is a more realistic estimate of @xmath34 from broadband modeling of the afterglow light curves .",
    "we have now included the best density determinations that exist for about 1/3 of the grbs in table 1 . in the past",
    ", large systematic differences in @xmath34 have been derived owing to incomplete datasets and the use of approximate relations for estimating afterglow parameters @xcite . however , with more precise photometric data and the increasing sophistication of afterglow modeling , the true diversity of number densities is becoming a well - established observation .",
    "modeling yields estimates in the range 0.1 @xmath51  @xmath34  30 @xmath51 and there is now little support for extremes of either high or low density .",
    "herein we make use of published estimates of @xmath34 and adopt a ( new ) canonical value of 10 @xmath51 for all remaining events .      in table 2 , we show the computed energetics values for @xmath10 and the associated apparent grb distance moduli , dm , for a cosmology with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 kms@xmath55mpc@xmath55 . of the 9 grbs with measured @xmath30 , @xmath56 and @xmath34 , the logarithmically - weighted mean",
    "total energy release is 1.16 foe @xmath57 0.07 dex with a median energy of 1.33 foe .",
    "we therefore adopt a new standard energy of @xmath58 foe with an error of @xmath57 0.07 dex .",
    "this standard value is dependent upon the choice of cosmology .",
    "if we expand the sample to include all bursts with knowns redshifts and @xmath59 but not density , the logarithmically - weighted mean energy is 1.21 foe @xmath57 0.08 dex . that these two mean values agree",
    "suggests that the assignment of @xmath60 @xmath51 to the 7 bursts with only @xmath59 measurements reasonably reflects the density of the population without @xmath34 measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : hub3 ] shows a histogram of @xmath10 measurements , tightly clustered about @xmath37 .",
    "note that the adopted value for @xmath37 , now found using a proper inclusion of density into the @xmath10 formulation , is a factor of 2.7 higher than that found in fks .",
    "this is close to the analytic difference expected ( @xmath61 for @xmath48 ) by assuming @xmath62 @xmath51 instead of @xmath50 @xmath51 , as in fks .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : hub3 ] , 11 of the 16 grbs with @xmath10 measurements fall within 5 @xmath12 of @xmath37 and five bursts ( 970508 , 990123 , 990510 , 000418 , 011211 ) are outside 5 @xmath12 of @xmath37 .",
    "the variance of all 16 grbs with measured @xmath10 about our adopted standard energy is 0.35 dex and is dominated by the five outliers .",
    "though there is no _ a priori _ reason to exclude these outlier bursts , the observed scatter of the more restricted sample without the outliers about @xmath37 is 0.13 dex , about a factor of 35% .",
    "the small apparent scatter of measured @xmath10 values is continued evidence for a standard energy release in prompt @xmath0-ray emission , first noted in fks .",
    "as we pointed out in garching 2001 , this observation suggests that grbs may be used as calibrated standard candles , useful , in principle , for measuring the geometric parameters of the universe ( `` cosmography '' ) .    a hubble diagram",
    ", apparent distance modulus versus redshift , is one way to visualize the standard candle relation , now where the distance in the vertical axis corresponds to magnitude ( i.e. ,  2.5 mag is a difference of a factor of 10 ) . in figure [ fig : hub ]",
    ", we present the apparent grb distance moduli for the 24 grbs where such measurements ( or constraints thereon ) are now possible .",
    "the solid curves show the theoretical distance moduli in six cosmologies . for each cosmology ,",
    "we re - compute @xmath37 using the median of the same well - studied bursts as described above .",
    "this value of @xmath37 is then used to set the zeropoint of the apparent grb dm measurements from equation [ eq : dm1 ] .    aside from an overall zeropoint ,",
    "the values of the apparent grb dm are almost entirely dependent on observables , and not cosmology , yet the theoretical dm curve are sensitive to cosmology ( @xmath64 ) . that the theoretical dm curves trace the apparent grb dm measurements in figure [ fig : hub ] ,",
    "is simply a recasting of the standard candle energy result .",
    "one striking feature of figure [ fig : hub ] is that the data appear to be well - represented by the theoretical curves in all six ( rather different ) cosmologies , with no apparent discrepant trend with redshift .",
    "the rms scatter about the respective @xmath37 is about the same in each cosmology ( @xmath65 dex ) , dominated by the outliers in the distribution .",
    "the main difference between various cosmological formulations is that the standard energy varies by a factor of @xmath66 , all about energies of @xmath131 foe .",
    "we explain the insensitivity of the energy data to cosmographic discrimination as follows . without an _ a priori _ knowledge of the true standard energy release  either via observations of a local sample or from theoretical studies ",
    "the data themselves are used to find the standard energy , setting the zeropoint for the dm measurements .",
    "this is akin to side - stepping the cosmological distance `` ladder . ''",
    "indeed without an anchor , the divergence of theoretical dms in different cosmologies at large redshifts is subtle , and hence more difficult to observe . in other words , unlike with other cosmological tools such as with sne type ia ( with local calibrations ) or the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( which depend only on local physics ) , any cosmographic discrimination with grbs is performed differentially . as can be seen in figure [ fig : hub ] , the current scatter in grb energies is simply to large for any apparent differential trend with redshift to be seen .",
    "the detection of lower - redshift ( @xmath67 ) bursts with _",
    "swift _ would help pin down @xmath37 and increase the sensitivity of the sample to cosmology .",
    "as noted in  [ sec : introduction ] , cosmographic applications benefit enormously if the objects are well understood physically . lacking a clear understanding ( as is arguably still the case with type ia sne )",
    ", an astronomical appreciation of the diversity of the phenomenon is critical . in short ,",
    "if the scatter on @xmath10 is ever to be reduced _ a priori _ , it is essential that we develop the ability to identify sub - classes from observations so that a homogeneous set of grbs can be identified for cosmographic applications .",
    "we already know of at least one member of a distinct sub - class of grbs : the grb associated with sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "indeed grb980425 , with an isotropic - equivalent energy release of @xmath68erg , is clearly abnormal ( see figure  [ fig : hub2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that such low - luminosity grbs that are associated with supernovae to be `` s - grbs '' .",
    "recently , @xcite identified @xmath1390 such low - redshift s - grb candidates in the _ batse _ sample . without appealing to @xmath0-ray properties ,",
    "such grbs are readily identified by their low redshift , and possibly , the dominance of the associated supernova emission over the afterglow light .    of the more classical `` cosmological grbs , '' those with known redshifts beyond @xmath69 mpc or associated with distant galaxies , we can use figure 3 help identify classes of outliers . in figure",
    "[ fig : hub2 ] , we show the @xmath10 distribution energy versus redshift for the 24 bursts with known redshift .",
    "we also show the trajectory of @xmath10 for the 5 bursts where no redshift is known .",
    "these curves were found by computing the individual @xmath31-corrections and @xmath41 as a function of redshift .",
    "note that the implied @xmath10 curve begins to flatten at high redshift as a result of the mitigation between larger @xmath33 and smaller inferred @xmath41 . from figure",
    "[ fig : hub2 ] , it can be seen that the energy release in grb980329 and grb000630 could have been consistent with @xmath37 for redshift @xmath70 .",
    "the present observations provide only a weak lower - limit to the energy of grb981226 .",
    "as is readily seen in figure [ fig : hub2 ] , grb980519 and grb980326 , stand out for being significantly lower in energy release than the cosmological set . even at a redshift of 5 ,",
    "these bursts released less than 0.2 foe .",
    "interestingly , independent of the inferred low energy , grb980519 and grb980326 have previously been recognized as peculiar in that both afterglows exhibited an unusually steep decline , flux @xmath71 with @xmath72 ( instead of the usual @xmath73 ) at early times .",
    "we propose that bursts with early - time steeply declining afterglows may be intrinsically under - energetic and suggest a nomenclature , `` fast - fading grbs '' or f - grbs ( in analogy with the `` branch peculiar '' of type ia sne ) , for such grbs .",
    "while the identification of f - grbs , based upon fast - declining afterglows , is also an appeal to the physical state of those systems , under the assumption of an ism density , we can not identify any unifying observation of the 5 closer energy outliers ( 970508 , 990123 , 990510 , 000418 , 011211 ) that belie some unifying physical process .",
    "we therefore can not ( yet ) distinguish such bursts _ a priori _ from the remainder of the set .",
    "bursts that are f - grbs could be either genuinely low - energy events or grbs which typical energy releases by taking place in particularly dense media ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; note that for the best studied f - grb030329 ( see below)there is no indication of a dense medium . in formulating our energy measurements",
    "we have explicitly assumed that the afterglow emission before the jet break arises in a medium where density is constant and homogeneous ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) .",
    "since the environments of a least some grbs are thought to be clumpy @xcite and wind - blown ( i.e. , @xmath75 ; @xcite ) , this is clearly not the case for all grbs in our sample ; therefore , our estimations of @xmath41 may be inappropriate for some grbs . as in the homogeneous case ,",
    "grbs the dynamics of @xmath19 in jetted grb within winds should be insensitive to the jet edge so long as @xmath76 .",
    "we can therefore calculate @xmath6(wind ) by inverting the equation for @xmath19 in eq .  1 of @xcite : @xmath77 for all bursts in our sample for which @xmath78 has been reported we calculate @xmath79 following eqs .",
    "[ eq : egamma ] and [ eq : wind ] .",
    "the results are as follows ( @xmath79 , @xmath10/@xmath80 erg , @xmath78 reference ) : 970508 ( 20.81@xmath81 , 3.560 ; @xcite ) ; 980519 ( 4.88@xmath81 , 6.262 ; @xcite ) ( 5.13@xmath81 , 6.941 ; @xcite ) ; 991208 ( @xmath825.29@xmath81 , @xmath824.771 ; @xcite ) ; 990123 ( 2.82@xmath81 , 17.390 ; @xcite ) ; 000301c ( 8.15@xmath81 , 4.411 ; @xcite ) ; 000418 ( 11.78@xmath81 , 15.834 ; @xcite ) ; 000926 ( 5.24@xmath81 , 11.689 ; @xcite ) ; 010222 ( 1.93@xmath81 , 4.891 ; @xcite ) ; 011121 ( @xmath834.47@xmath81 , @xmath831.390 ; @xcite ) .",

    "comparison with table 2 shows that the inferred values for @xmath6 and @xmath10 are usually smaller under the wind assumption .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath78 are not generally provided so it is unclear if the energy determinations are consistent between winds and ism models .",
    "grb970508 is underluminous by a factor of @xmath133 in both the ism and wind cases .",
    "both grb000418 and grb990123 , overluminous in the ism case , are more consistent with the standard @xmath37 in the wind case .",
    "only grb980519 and grb011121 show convincing evidence for a wind - stratified medium under the assumption of a top - hat jet model ( grb980326 is consistent with a wind ; @xcite ) .",
    "as seen , the energy release in grb011121 is similar in both the wind and ism cases .",
    "interestingly , the energy release in grb980519 , again assuming @xmath84 and a wind - blown circumburst medium , is 6.3 @xmath85 erg and thus consistent with @xmath37 . therefore it may be reasonable to suspect that all f - grbs are bursts that occur in wind - stratified media ( but not necessarily the converse ) .",
    "with nine new bursts suitable for @xmath10 measurement after fks , the evidence for a standard release of energy in grbs persists . by incorporating more realistic measurements of ambient density and under the assumption of a top - hat jet and constant ambient density media ,",
    "we find a standard candle energy release of @xmath58 foe , with a burst  to  burst scatter of 0.35 dex about this value .",
    "though this result makes it interesting to consider cosmographic applications of grbs , we have shown that without a local calibration of the true energy release , the observed scatter is simply too large to make any meaningful impact on cosmographic measurements .    the most obvious way to reduce the scatter on @xmath37 is to simply remove outliers from the sample , based purely upon discrepant energy measurements . however ,",
    "this is a dangerously circular approach since it is particularly these apparent outliers in energy , at high redshift especially , that place the most meaningful constraints for cosmography .",
    "still , at this stage , we are confined to first recognize heterogeneity in the context of a cosmological model and then find similarities between discrepant bursts , based upon observations or theory that are _ complementary _ to energy . to this end , we have noted that both grb980519 and grb980326 are low - energy bursts _ and _ stand out based upon afterglow observations .",
    "indeed , lacking firm theoretical predictions for sub - classification , we have proposed that there are at least two sub - classes  s - grbs and f - grbs  of grbs which can be typed or classified from simple observations .",
    "both groups were first identified by low inferred @xmath0-ray energy releases .",
    "now , s - grbs are characterized by low redshift and f - grbs are identified by the rapid fading , @xmath86 , of their afterglow at early times , @xmath87 0.5 day ( restframe ) .",
    "the advantage of empirical distance indicators ( e.g. , @xcite ) is that they can be entirely based on the @xmath0-ray observations and do not require ( once calibrated ) additional time - consuming observations from the ground .",
    "however , as with many empirical indicators , the method relies on poorly understood physical mechanisms ( although , see , @xcite ) .",
    "the sheer bewildering diversity in any high - energy property of grbs  richness of profiles , overall profile shapes , fluences , peak luminosities and even peak energies  should give pause to claims of the predictive power of distance indicators in the absence of a realistic physical model for the emission mechanisms .",
    "the physical uncertainty aside , it is clear that the high energy properties can and have provided gross distinctions . the well - known separation in energy and spectra between short - bursts and hard - bursts @xcite , for example , has led to the belief that bursts from each class may originate from different progenitors . as a more recent example , we note that @xcite has used the lag  luminosity relation to identify a subsample of long - duration bursts whose properties distinguish them from the general population .",
    "however , we question whether empirical relations have demonstrated that they possess the precision necessary to advance cosmography .",
    "there is little reason based on the limited understanding of the grb phenomenon to strongly justify an optimistic expectation in this direction .",
    "the approach we have used in fks and herein has the advantage that it is based upon energy release , a fundamental quantity in explosions ; on physical grounds , it is reasonable to expect that such a quantity could be standard ( or at least amenable to calibration ) despite the rich diversity in grb properties .",
    "the standard energy result is corroborated by other studies ( which do not rely on the @xmath0-ray data ) , namely multi - wavelength afterglow modeling and x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "we stress that if grbs are ever to be used for cosmographic purposes , there must be a significantly increased understanding in the diversity of the phenomenon ( let alone the secular evolution with redshift ) . to this end , using simple observations , at least two sub - classes of grbs , the s - grbs and the f - grbs , may be readily recognized . for the short term , we believe that the identification of such bursts will provide informative direction to hone in on grb progenitors .",
    "to weed out such bursts and create a more homogeneous sample for cosmography , however , our proposed identification methods have the disadvantage of requiring significant follow up observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that in the _ swift _ era , dedicated facilities will undertake the necessary follow - up observations quite routinely .",
    "after this paper was submitted , grb030329 was discovered and found to fade rapidly at early times ( @xmath88 ) @xcite suggesting that the burst fit our definition of an f - grb . using the same formalism above",
    ", we find @xmath89 erg assuming a constant density ism and @xmath90 @xmath51 or @xmath91 erg assuming a wind with @xmath92 . in the former case ,",
    "grb030329 is underluminous by a factor of 16.3 from the @xmath37 found herein .",
    "thus grb030329 joins grb980519 and grb980326 in the same sub - class both on energetics and phenomenological grounds .",
    "given new the connection of grb030329 with a supernova @xcite , we suggest that all f - grbs may be associated with supernovae . obviously with afterglows that fade fast",
    "there is an increasing likelihood of detecting a supernova component ( the non - detection of a sn component in the optical light curve of grb980519 , see @xcite , may simply be due to @xmath93 of this burst ) .",
    "however , we suggest that the connection may be more than due to observational bias ; instead long - duration grbs could arise from two populations of bursts @xcite , with f - grbs from massive stars that produce winds prior to the grb and a concurrent supernova with the grb event . alternatively , especially in light of the detection of a supernova component with grb011121 @xcite",
    ", we favor the hypothesis that all long - duration grbs also lead to supernovae , with the diversity in grb energies set by a progenitor - dependent ratio of the energy channeled into the relativistic jets to the energy powering the explosion the massive star progenitor .",
