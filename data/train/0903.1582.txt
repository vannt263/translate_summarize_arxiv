    "data reported here ( see fig .  7 in",
    "more extended vhe emission may also be expected from cen  a. in this context , @xcite proposed that @xmath1-rays emitted in the immediate vicinity of the active nucleus are partly absorbed by the starlight radiation in the host galaxy . the created @xmath59 pairs",

    "furthermore , hadronic models have been invoked to predict vhe emission from radio galaxies . in this context , @xcite proposed a synchrotron - proton blazar model for m  87 where the high energy component in the sed is interpreted in terms of synchrotron emission from either primary protons or secondary @xmath63 and @xmath64 created in the inner jet . at larger distances and in the peculiar case of cen",
    "a , ultrarelativistic protons with @xmath65ev could be released within the kpc - scale jet , and would be then confined in the host galaxy by interactions with the interstellar magnetic field .",

    "results reported here ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "it has also been argued that vhe emission could originate from the outer giant radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lying at @xmath66 from the core .",
    "however , the vhe @xmath1-ray excess presented here only matches the position of the core , the pc / kpc inner jets and the inner radio lobes .",
    "only upper limits at vhe have been derived for the southern outer lobe @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the detection of non - thermal x - ray synchrotron emission from the shock of the southwest inner radio lobe .",
    "the edge of this lobe is located @xmath67 from the nucleus and reveals edge - brightened x - ray emission @xcite . while the position is @xmath68 away from the best fit position of the vhe excess , it is well within the upper limit of the extension .",
    "studying the spatial variation of the spectral index in x - rays across this shock region , @xcite constrained the high energy cut - off in the electron distribution to be @xmath69 .",
    "they investigated inverse compton scattering the starlight radiation and the cmb from high energy particles in this lobe and predicted a vhe emission well compatible with the h.e.s.s .",
    "measurement reported here ( see their fig .",
    "8) for both seed radiation fields .",
    "this study would suggest cena is analogous to a gigantic supernova remnant ( snr ) .    besides the components of the agn hosted in cena",
    ", one might wonder whether other sources in the host galaxy could be responsible for the vhe emission .",
    "for example , @xcite detected more than 200 x - ray point sources in cen  a , and iacts have detected about 60 vhe sources in our galaxy , many of which are associated with snrs and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "however , source ensembles , such as the sum of the contributions from snrs / pwne , would require an unrealistically large number of sources ( assuming a typical luminosity of @xmath70ergs@xmath7 above 250gev per source ) .    further information on the vhe excess position , more detailed spectral shape and variability studies are required to differentiate between the different models .",
    "however , if the vhe emission is due to a misaligned blazar - like process  such as leptonic or hadronic emission from the jet  the proximity of cen  a makes it a very good laboratory to further investigate emission processes and jet physics in blazars .",
    "if the vhe emission originates from another process ",
    "e.g. uhecr interacting with the interstellar medium , or a snr type process at the shock  this would be very exciting , giving new insights into the physics in the vhe domain .",
    "cena represents a rich potential for future vhe experiments .",
    "our current data are at the edge of differentiating the possible emitting regions . with higher sensitivity ( factor 10 ) ,",
    "better astrometric accuracy and angular resolution ( e.g. @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ) @xcite , cta would allow the localization of the site of the vhe emission , and , possibly , reveal multiple vhe emitting sources within cen  a. more generally , the detection of vhe emission from cen  a together with the detection of m87 and the galactic center poses the question of whether vhe emission ( @xmath1-ray brightness ) might be a general feature of agn .",
    "while the sensitivity of current generation experiments is probably too low to answer this question , one can hope that the cta experiment will be able to detect a large enough sample of sources to shed some light on this issue ."
