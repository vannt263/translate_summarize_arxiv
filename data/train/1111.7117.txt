    "the existence of the gravitino in the particle spectrum of locally supersymmetric theories leads to problems in the standard cosmological scenario .",
    "one manifestation of this so - called cosmological gravitino problem appears in scenarios where the baryon asymmetry is generated via thermal leptogenesis .",
    "the late decays of the abundantly produced gravitino are in conflict with the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "a similar problem even persists in scenarios where the gravitino is the lightest superpartner and thus a candidate for the dark matter . in this case",
    "late decays of the next - to - lightest superpartner can spoil the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis . among several other possibilities a very attractive solution to this problem are theories with a slight violation of r - parity  @xcite .",
    "theories with bilinear r - parity violation only violate lepton number and are thus not affected by proton stability constraints .",
    "the size of the r - parity violating couplings are , however , constrained by cosmological considerations : they must be large enough to allow for the decay of the next - to - lightest superpartner before the time of big bang nucleosynthesis and they must be small enough that the baryon asymmetry of the universe is not washed out by these additional interactions .",
    "interestingly , the allowed window for the couplings leads to a gravitino lifetime exceeding the age of the universe by several orders of magnitude , thus making the unstable gravitino a viable dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing feature of this scenario is that it exhibits a rich phenomenology although the gravitino usually is thought to be one of the most elusive particles .",
    "for instance , the next - to - lightest superpartner decays mainly via the small r - parity violating couplings and is thus long - lived on collider scales  @xcite . in addition , the decay of gravitino dark matter in the galactic halo can lead to observable signals in the spectra of cosmic rays as we will discuss in the following .",
    "the gravitino can decay into several two - body final states : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate analytically the branching ratios for these decay channels , while the spectra of stable final state particles ",
    "_ i.e. _ photons , electrons , protons , deuterons and neutrinos  are obtained by a pythia simulation of the gravitino decay  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this conference contribution is to briefly report on the phenomenological results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "in recent years several anomalies in the spectra of cosmic rays have been reported that can not be explained by astrophysical secondary production and could be a hint for a signal from dark matter annihilation or decay . indeed , the decay of gravitino dark matter leads to a hard spectrum of positrons ( and electrons ) that  depending on the gravitino mass and lifetime  could explain the rise in the positron fraction observed by the pamela experiment  @xcite .",
    "this contribution could also be observed as a subdominant component in the absolute electron flux ( see figure  [ positronelectron ] ) .",
    "positron fraction ( _ left _ ) and electron spectrum ( _ right _ ) expected from gravitino dark matter decays compared to data and the expected astrophysical background .",

    "shaded bands show the uncertainty due to charged cosmic - ray propagation through the galaxy.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    however , gravitino decays unavoidably produce associated fluxes of antiprotons and gamma rays that are only compatible with observations if the gravitino lifetime is larger than needed for an explanation of the pamela data ( see figure  [ antiprotongamma ] ) .",
    "therefore , a gravitino dark matter explanation of the pamela data is ruled out and additional astrophysical sources like pulsars are required to explain the observed positron fraction .",

    "the expected signal may exceed the astrophysical background especially for lower gravitino masses and can be tested with forthcoming experiments like ams-02 and the gaps balloon , thereby making antideuterons a valuable tool to probe light gravitinos ( see figure  [ antideuteron ] ) .",

    "an intriguing feature of the expected signal is the line at the end of the spectrum that persists  in contrast to gamma rays  also for large gravitino masses ( see figure  [ neutrino ] ) . in neutrino telescopes like icecube neutrinos",
    "are mainly detected via the cherenkov light of neutrino - induced upward through - going muons .",
    "although the rather poor energy resolution of this channel obscures the expected spectral features , a statistical analysis might reveal a departure from the featureless spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos ( see figure  [ muons ] ) .",

    "figures taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=34.0% ]    we find that a new detection channel , namely neutrino - induced showers , has two advantages compared to the muon signal : the dominant background of atmospheric muon neutrinos contributes less to this channel and its better energy resolution allows for a better discrimination of spectral features ( see figure  [ showers ] ) . although there are currently still problems to discriminate the shower signal from short muon tracks we conclude that this channel is the most promising for a detection of neutrinos from gravitino decays .",
