    "in the currently favored paradigm of planet formation , the location of the snow line in the protoplanetary disk plays a pivotal role . beyond the snow line , ices can condense , and the surface density of solids is expected to be higher by a factor of several relative to its value just inside this line . as a result of this increased surface density , planet formation is expected to be most efficient just beyond the snow line , whereas for increasing distances from the central star the planet formation efficiency drops , as the surface density decreases and the dynamical time increases @xcite . in this scenario , gas - giant planets must form in the region of the protoplanetary disk immediately beyond the snow - line , as the higher surface density is required to build icy protoplanetary cores that are sufficiently massive to accrete a substantial gaseous envelope while there is remaining nebular gas @xcite .",
    "low - mass primaries are expected to be much less efficient at forming gas giants because of the longer dynamical times and lower surface densities at the snow lines of these stars @xcite .",
    "migration due to nebular tides and other dynamical processes can then bring the icy cores or gas giants from their formation sites to orbits substantially interior to the snow line @xcite .",
    "the precise location of the snow line in protoplanetary disks is a matter of some debate ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is even likely to evolve during the epoch of planet formation , particularly for low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the condensation temperature of water is @xmath12 , and a fiducial value for the location of the snow line in solar - mass stars motivated by observations in our solar system is @xmath13 .",
    "this may scale linearly with the stellar mass @xmath14 , since the stellar luminosity during the epoch of planet formation scales as @xmath15 for stars with @xmath16 @xcite . whereas the radial velocity and especially transit methods are most sensitive to planets that are close to their parent star at distances well inside the snow line , the sensitivity of the microlensing method peaks at planetary separations near the einstein ring radius of the primary lens @xcite , which is @xmath17 for typical lens and source distances of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a peak sensitivity at equilibrium temperatures of @xmath20 for a mass - luminosity relation of the form @xmath21 , and distances relative to the snow line of @xmath22 if the location of the snow line at the epoch of planet formation scales as @xmath14 .",
    "thus microlensing is currently the best method of probing planetary systems in the critical region just beyond the snow line @xcite .",
    "planetary perturbations in microlensing events come in two general classes .",
    "the majority of planetary perturbations are expected to occur when a planet directly perturbs one of the two images created by the primary lens , as the image sweeps by the planet during the microlensing event @xcite .",
    "although these perturbations are more common , they are also unpredictable and can occur at any time during the event .",
    "early microlensing planet searches focused on this class of perturbations , as it was the first to be identified and explored theoretically @xcite .",
    "the second class of planetary perturbations occurs in high - magnification events , in which the source becomes very closely aligned with the primary lens @xcite .",
    "in such events , the two primary - lens images become highly distorted and sweep along nearly the entirety of the einstein ring @xcite . these sweeping images probe subtle distortions of the einstein ring caused by nearby planets , which will give rise to perturbations within the full - width half - maximum of the event @xcite .",
    "although high - magnification events are rare and so contribute a minority of the planetary perturbations , they are individually more sensitive to planets because the images probe nearly the entire einstein ring . furthermore ,",
    "since the perturbations are localized to the peak of the event which can be predicted beforehand , they can be monitored more efficiently with limited resources than the more common low - magnification events .    for these reasons ,",
    "current microlensing planet searches tend to deliberately focus on high - magnification events .",
    "thus , of the seven prior microlensing planets discovered to date @xcite , five have been found in high - magnification events , with peak magnifications ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24",
    ". however , despite the fact that this planet - search strategy has proven to be so successful , the properties of the planetary perturbations generated in high - magnification events are less well - understood than those in low - magnification events .",
    "most of the studies of the properties of planetary perturbations in high - magnification events have focused on the properties of the caustics , the locus of points defining one or more closed curves , upon which the magnification of a point source is formally infinite .",
    "the morphology and extent of the region of significant perturbation by the planetary companion can be largely understood by the shape and size of these caustic curves .",
    "planetary perturbations in high - magnification events are caused by a central caustic located near the position of the primary , and thus several authors have considered the size and shape of these central caustics as a function of the parameters of the planet @xcite .",
    "these and other authors have identified several potential degeneracies that complicate the unique interpretation of central caustic perturbations . the first to be identified is a degeneracy such that the caustic structure ( and so light curve morphology ) of a planet with mass ratio @xmath25 and projected separation in units of the einstein ring @xmath26 not too close to unity is essentially identical under the transformation @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a second degeneracy arises from the fact that very close or very wide roughly equal - mass binaries also produce perturbations near the peak of the light curves .",
    "these give rise to perturbations that have the same gross observables as planetary perturbations .",
    "the severity of these degeneracies depends on both the specific parameters of the planetary / binary companion , as well as on the data quality and coverage . @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the @xmath27 degeneracy is less severe for more massive planets with separations closer to the einstein ring ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "empirically , this degeneracy was broken at the @xmath29 level for the relatively large mass - ratio planetary companion ogle-2005-blg-071 lb @xcite , for which the light curve was well - sampled , but was essentially unresolved for the low mass - ratio planetary companion moa-2007-blg-192 lb @xcite , for which the planetary perturbation was poorly sampled .",
    "for the planetary / equal - mass binary degeneracy , @xcite argued that , although the gross features of central caustic planetary perturbations can be reproduced by very close or very wide binary lenses , the morphologies differ in detail , and thus this degeneracy can be resolved with reasonable light curve coverage and moderate photometric precision . indeed for every well - sampled high - magnification event containing a perturbation near the peak ( and that is not in the @xcite limits ) , this degeneracy has been resolved @xcite .",
    "even for the relatively poorly - sampled light curve of moa-2007-blg-192 lb , an equal - mass binary model is ruled out at @xmath30 @xcite , although in this case this is partially attributable to the exquisite photometric precision ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "one complication with searching for planets in high - magnification events is that , the higher the magnification ,",
    "the more likely it is that the primary lens will transit the source .",
    "when this happens , the peak of the event is suppressed and smoothed out , as the lens strongly magnifies only a small portion of the source .",
    "if the source is also larger than the region of significant perturbations due to a planetary companion ( roughly the size of the central caustic ) , then the planetary deviations will also be smoothed out and suppressed @xcite .",
    "these finite source effects have potential implications for both the detectability of central caustic perturbations , as well as the ability to uniquely determine the planetary parameters , and in particular resolve the two degeneracies discussed above . in practice ,",
    "the caustic structures of all four high - magnification planetary events ( containing five planets ) were larger than the source .",
    "hence , while there were detectable finite - source effects in all cases ( which helped constrain the angular einstein radius and so the physical lens parameters ) , the planetary perturbations were in all four cases quite noticeable .",
    "thus the effect of large sources on the the detectability and interpretation of central - caustic perturbations has not been explored in practice .",
    "theoretical studies of detectability of central caustic perturbations when considering finite source effects have been performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrated that the qualitative nature of planetary perturbations from central caustics is dramatically different for sources that are larger than the caustic .",
    "in particular , the detailed structure of the point - source magnification pattern , which generally follows the shape of the caustic , is essentially erased or washed out .",
    "rather , the perturbation structure is characterized by a roughly circular region of very low - level , almost imperceptible deviation from the single - lens form that is roughly the size of the source and centered on the primary lens .",
    "this region is surrounded by an annular rim of larger deviations that has a width roughly equal to the width of the caustic @xcite . finally , there are less pronounced deviations that extend to a few source radii .",
    "planets are detectable even if their central caustics are quite a bit smaller than the source , provided that the @xmath32 deviation is sufficiently high .",
    "( often @xmath33 is adopted , although @xmath34 may be more realistic . )",
    "the magnitude of these perturbations decrease as the ratio between the source size and caustic size increases , making it difficult to detect very small planets for large sources @xcite .",
    "although central caustics may formally be detectable when the source is substantially larger than the caustic , it remains a significant question whether these very washed out caustics can be recognized in practice , and even if they can , whether they can be uniquely interpreted in terms of planetary parameters .",
    "indeed , it is unknown whether a washed out central caustic due to a planet can actually be distinguished from one due to a binary companion .",
    "this question is especially important with regard to low - mass planets .",
    "the size of the central caustic scales as the product of the planet / star mass ratio and a definite function of planet - star separation .",
    "hence , taken as a whole , smaller planets produce smaller caustics , meaning that events of higher magnification are required to detect them .",
    "these are just the events that are most likely to have their peaks washed out by finite - source effects .    here",
    "we analyze the first high - magnification event with a buried signature of a planet , in which the source size is larger than the central caustic of the planet .",
    "the caustic is indeed so washed out that the event appears unperturbed upon casual inspection .",
    "however , the residuals to a point - lens fit are clear and highly significant .",
    "we show that one can infer the planetary ( as opposed to binary ) nature of the perturbation from the general pattern of these residuals , and that a detailed analysis constrains the mass ratio of the planet quite well , but leaves the close / wide ( @xmath27 ) degeneracy intact .",
    "hence , at least in this case , the fact that the caustic is buried in the source does not significantly hinder one s ability to uncover the planet and measure its mass ratio .",
    "moa-2007-blg-400 [ @xmath35 , ( l , b)=(2.38,@xmath36 ) ] was announced as a probable microlensing event by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaboration on 5 sept 2007 ( hjd@xmath37 hjd - 2450000 = 4349.1 ) , about 5 days before peak .",
    "the source star proves to be a bulge subgiant and so is somewhat brighter than average , but the event timescale was relatively short ( @xmath38days ) and observations had been interrupted for 6 days by bad weather . taken together , the two latter facts account for the relatively late alert . by coincidence",
    ", the triggering observations took place on the same night that another event , ogle-2007-blg-349 ( aka moa-2007-blg-379 ) , was peaking at extremely high magnification with an already - obvious planetary anomaly . after focusing exclusively on the latter event for the first 5 hours of the night",
    ", moa resumed its normal field rotation for the last 1.5 hours , which led to the discovery of moa-2007-blg-400 .",
    "the microlensing follow up network ( @xmath39fun ) began observing this as a possible high - magnification event on 7 sept , but did not mobilize intensive observations until ut 08:55 10 sept , just 15 hours before peak , following a high - mag alert issued by moa a few minutes earlier . even at that point ,",
    "the predicted minimum peak magnification was only @xmath40 , which would have enabled only modest sensitivity to planets .",
    "nevertheless , all stops were pulled and it was observed as intensively as possible from 7 observatories , @xmath39fun cba perth ( australia ) 0.25 m unfiltered , @xmath39fun bronberg ( south africa ) 0.35 m unfiltered , @xmath39fun smarts ( ctio , chile ) 1.3 m @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath39fun campo catino austral ( cao , chile ) 0.50 m unfiltered , @xmath39fun farm cove ( new zealand ) 0.35 m unfiltered , @xmath39fun auckland ( new zealand ) 0.4 m @xmath44 , and @xmath39fun southern stars ( tahiti ) 0.28 m unfiltered .",
    "the source star lies just outside one of the ogle fields ( as defined by their field templates ) and for this reason was not recognized as a microlensing event by the ogle early warning system .",
    "however , due to small variations in pointing , there are a total of 452 ogle images containing this source .",
    "only two of these are _ significantly _ magnified , ten days and nine days before peak .",
    "hence , the ogle data do not help constrain the light curve parameters . however , they are useful to study of the baseline behavior of the source ( see appendix  [ sec : append_ell ] ) .    essentially all of the `` action '' , both the peak of the event and the planetary anomalies , occurred during the @xmath39fun smarts ( chile ) observations at ctio , @xmath45 , using the andicam optical / ir dual - channel camera , and @xmath39fun cao ( chile ) observations @xmath46 .",
    "most ( 45 ) of the optical ctio observations over the peak were carried out in @xmath42 band , with a few ( 8) taken in @xmath41 in order to measure the @xmath47 color .",
    "each of these was a 5 minute exposure , with approximately 1 minute read - out time between exposures . during each optical exposure",
    ", there were 5 dithered @xmath43-band exposures , each of 50 seconds , almost equally spaced over the 6 minute cycle time .",
    "that is , @xmath48 @xmath43-band observations in all .",
    "unfortunately , the source became so bright as it transited the lens ( i.e. , when the planetary anomalies were the strongest ) , that 14 @xmath42-band images were affected by non - linearities and saturation in the detector response .",
    "we exclude these 14 @xmath42-band data points from analysis .",
    "the @xmath43-band photometry are not affected by this problem , therefore , with higher time resolution and more continuous coverage than the @xmath42-band data , the @xmath43-band data provide most of the constraining power to the microlens model .",
    "there were 84 cao un - filtered observations taken during the peak night .",
    "unfortunately , the peak of the event was severely saturated and the clock zero point is not securely known , therefore , these data are not used in the analysis",
    ". however , the exposures during the times of maximum deviation from a point lens ( i.e. , when the caustic was crossing the stellar limb ) are not saturated , and these qualitatively confirm the interpretation from the more detailed ctio data .",
    "the moa data were reduced using the standard moa difference imaging analysis ( dia ) pipeline .",
    "all @xmath39fun data were reduced using dia developed by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43-band data are affected by intrapixel sensitivity variations at the 1% level .",
    "fortunately , the dither pattern was repeated almost exactly over the night of the peak , so that these variations follow the 5-element dither pattern quite well .",
    "we therefore treat the @xmath43-band data as 5 independent data sets , which reduces @xmath32 by 180 for 8 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath43-band images show a triangular psf , which is likely to introduce systematic errors into the photometry . as a crosscheck",
    ", we also use the dia package developed by @xcite to independently reduce these images .",
    "despite the fact that the peak of moa-2007-blg-400 was `` flattened '' by finite - source effects , it nevertheless reached a very high peak magnification , @xmath49 . however , even to the experienced eye , it looks like an ordinary point - lens light curve with pronounced finite - source effects . more detailed modeling is required to infer that it actually contains a jovian mass - ratio planet .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows the light curve together with the best - fit point - lens model ( blue ) and planetary model ( red ) .",
    "both include finite - source effects .",
    "the most pronounced features of the point - lens model residuals are a short positive spike on the rising side and a short negative spike on the falling side , each lasting about 30 minutes , which leave very similar traces in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "as displayed in figure [ fig : res ] , these features clearly stand out in the reductions using both the wozniak ( top panel ) and bond ( bottom panel ) dia packages .",
    "each package introduces its own systematic deviations , but there are no obvious trends besides the above features that are supported by both reductions .",
    "these occur very close to the times that the point lens begins and ends its transit of the source ( within the framework of this model ) .",
    "the timing of these deviations strongly suggests that they are due to microlensing rather than stellar variability .",
    "there are then two possible explanations : either the source is actually being transited by a more complicated caustic than a point lens ( due to a binary or planetary companion ) or the limb of the source is not being properly modeled .",
    "however , if one assumes a circular source , the latter explanation would imply symmetric residuals , whereas the actual residuals are closer to being antisymmetric .",
    "( we address the possibility of an elliptical source in appendix  [ sec : append_ell ] . )   indeed , this approximate antisymmetry extends to the less pronounced residual features , including the sustained deficit prior to the first spike ( and sustained excess following the second one ) as well as the declining residuals between the two spikes .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 residuals in itself argues that the deviations are due to microlensing rather than some sort of stellar variability , which would not generally be expected to be achromatic .",
    "the short durations of the spikes tell us that the central caustic is quite small , with `` caustic width '' @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the companion either has low mass ratio , or is a very wide or very close binary companion .",
    "formally , @xmath51 is given by equation ( 12 ) of @xcite as a very good approximation to the `` short diameter '' or `` width '' of a central caustic ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : caustic ] ) . however , here the estimate is quite inexact not only because the width of the spikes is not precisely defined , but also because we do not know , at this point , the exact orientation of the caustic .",
    "after some algebra , one finds that in two limiting regimes , the @xcite formula takes the forms , @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the companion / primary mass ratio and @xmath26 is the separation in units of the einstein ring .",
    "note that in the first limit ( eq .  [",
    "[ eqn : bgg1 ] ] ) , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the shear .",
    "the crossover point for these approximations is @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) , at which point each is in error by about 15% .",
    "( for simplicity , we restrict the discussion here to the case @xmath59 .",
    "there is a well - known @xmath60 degeneracy between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 limits , as can be guessed from the forms for w in eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : bgg1 ] ] .",
    "this degeneracy will prove to be almost perfect in this case , see ",
    "[ sec : broadsearch ] ) .   hence , in the first limit , @xmath63 , implying that if @xmath54 were in the `` binary range '' ( @xmath64 ) , then @xmath26 would be quite large .",
    "that is , the central caustic would be generated by a nearly pure shear and therefore would have a nearly symmetric , diamond - shaped , @xcite form . in the point - lens model , the lens passes almost directly over the center of the source . for this trajectory , a symmetric caustic would yield symmetric residuals , in sharp contrast to figure [ fig : lc ] . on the other hand , for the opposite limit , @xmath65 , which lies squarely in the planetary regime .",
    "thus , simple arguments already argue strongly in favor of a planetary companion that is fairly near the einstein ring .",
    "notwithstanding these arguments , we conduct a massive blind search for companions over a very broad range of masses using a modified version of the `` magnification map '' technique of @xcite , which was specifically designed for high - magnification events .",
    "the original approach was , for each given @xmath66 pair , to shoot rays over a fairly narrow annulus ( say , 0.01 einstein radii ) around the einstein ring in the image plane and to sort these rays in pixels on the source plane .",
    "then for each source position being modelled ( i.e. , each data point ) , one would identify the pixels that intersected the source and would check each ray contained in these pixels to determine whether it landed on the source and , if so , evaluate the source surface brightness at that position . in the initial broad search , three parameters @xmath67 are held fixed on a grid of values , while the remaining parameters ( @xmath68 , and possibly others ) are varied to minimize @xmath32 at each grid point . here , @xmath69 is the angle of the source trajectory relative to the binary axis , @xmath70 is the time of closest approach to the adopted center of the lens geometry ( usually the center of mass ) , @xmath71 is the source - lens separation at this time in units of the einstein radius , @xmath72 is the source radius in the same units , and @xmath73 is the einstein crossing time .",
    "this division is efficient because 1 ) ( @xmath68 ) are usually approximately known from the general structure of the light curve , so minimization over these parameters is straightforward once @xmath67 are fixed ; 2 ) @xmath66 define the map , which naturally facilitates minimization of other parameters except for @xmath69 , whose value is not usually even approximately obvious from the light curve .",
    "the new approach differs principally in that the pixels that are contained entirely within the source are now evaluated as a whole , i.e. , by the total number of rays in that pixel .",
    "pixels that cross the source boundary are still evaluated ray - by - ray , as previously .",
    "this primary change then leads to several other changes .",
    "first , for each pixel , we record not only the geometric center but also the centroid of the rays .",
    "the surface brightness is then evaluated at the latter position .",
    "second , the pixels are made much smaller , to minimize both the number of rays that must be evaluated individually and the surface - brightness variations across the pixel ( which are corrected only to first order by the ray - centroid scheme just mentioned ) .",
    "typically , there are a few hundreds of pixels per source .",
    "third , the pixels are hexagonal , since this is the most compact tiling possible , i.e. , the closest tile shape to a circle .",
    "fourth , the source positions outside the map region are evaluated using the hexadecapole and quadrupole approximation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we use markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) for the @xmath32 minimization .      the initial search for solutions is conducted over a rectilinear grid in @xmath74 rather @xmath66 . since the short diameter , or `` caustic width '' , @xmath51 , is a monotonic function of the star - planet separation @xmath26 ( at fixed planet / star mass ratio @xmath54 ) , these formulations are in some sense equivalent . however , for many events ( including the present one ) the short diameter @xmath51 can be estimated by simple examination of the data . in these cases ,",
    "the search space is both more regular and easier to define in terms of the @xmath74 grid .",
    "in particular , equation ( [ eqn : bsim1 ] ) shows that at fixed @xmath51 , @xmath26 moves very close to 1 for very low @xmath54 .",
    "we consider short diameters @xmath51 over the range @xmath75 and companion mass ratios @xmath76 , focusing on the regime @xmath77 .",
    "we find that there is only one local minimum in this range .",
    "the range of allowed solutions is well localized around this minimum , with @xmath78 with the last quantity being , of course , dependent on the first two .",
    "figure [ fig : qgamma ] shows the @xmath79 contours with respect to the mass ratio @xmath54 and the projected planet - star separation @xmath26 along with the short diameter @xmath51 .",
    "the main point to note is that these parameters are quite well constrained .",
    "note that , as expected , @xmath26 and @xmath54 are strongly correlated , while @xmath51 and @xmath54 are basically uncorrelated .",
    "we also perform similar searches using the alternative @xmath43-band reduction by bond s dia package .",
    "the solutions agree with the above to well within one sigma , but the parameters have larger uncertainties : @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore adopt results from the wozniak - based reductions , noting that they may subject to systematic errors @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ fig : caustic ] shows the source trajectory and the central caustics as well as the differences in magnification between the best - fit planetary model and its corresponding single - lens model .",
    "this geometry nicely accounts for the main features of the point - lens residuals seen in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the regions beyond the `` back walls '' ( long segments ) of the caustic are somewhat de - magnified , which accounts for the initial depression of the light curve .",
    "as the source crosses the `` back wall '' of the caustic , it spikes . after the source has exited the caustic , it continues to suffer additional magnification due to the `` ridge '' of magnification that extends from the trailing cusp .",
    "we also conducted a similar blind search as above , but concentrating on the regime @xmath82 .",
    "as expected , we recover the well - known @xmath60 degeneracy , and find a solution with essentially the same @xmath54 , but with @xmath83 , and the wide solution is slightly preferred by @xmath84 .",
    "thus , although each solution is well - localized to its respective minimum , this discrete degeneracy implies that the projected separation can take on two values that differ by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "the severity of the degeneracy can be traced to the planetary parameters . although the planet / star mass ratio is quite large , which tends to reduce the severity of the degeneracy , the planet lies quite far from the einstein ring , which tends to make it more severe . actually ,",
    "a better measure of the overall expected asymmetry between the @xmath26 and @xmath85 solutions is the short diameter @xmath51 , which in this case is small , implying a severe degeneracy .",
    "indeed , the caustic structure and magnification pattern of the two solutions are nearly identical . in this case",
    ", the large size of the source has competing influences on the ability to resolve the degeneracy . on one hand",
    ", the large size of the source serves to suppress the planetary deviations , thus making subtle differences more difficult to distinguish . on the other hand",
    ", the large source implies that a large fraction of the planetary perturbation region is probed . in this case , the source probes essentially the entire region of significant planetary perturbation , as can be seen in figure [ fig : caustic ] .",
    "this is important for distinguishing between the solutions , as the largest difference between the magnification patterns of the two degenerate solutions occurs in the region near the tip of the arrow - shaped caustic @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : caustic ] it is clear that this region would have been entirely missed if the source had been substantially smaller than the caustic .",
    "in addition to @xmath66 , the model also yields the source radius relative to the einstein radius , @xmath86 we then follow the standard @xcite technique to determine the angular source radius , @xmath87 that is , we first adopt @xmath88_{\\rm clump } = ( 1.00,14.32)$ ] for the dereddened position of the clump .",
    "we then measure the offset of the source relative to the clump centroid @xmath89 = ( -0.19,3.25)$ ] , to obtain @xmath88_s = ( 0.81,17.57)$ ] .",
    "see figure [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the instrumental source color is derived from model - independent regression of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 flux , while the instrumental magnitude is obtained from the light - curve model .",
    "we convert @xmath47 to @xmath90 using the color - color relations of @xcite , yielding @xmath91 , and then obtain equation ( [ eqn : thetastar ] ) using the color / surface - brightness relations of @xcite . combining equations ( [ eqn : rho ] ) and ( [ eqn : thetastar ] ) gives @xmath92mas . and combining this with the definition @xmath93 , where @xmath14 is the lens mass , @xmath94 is the source - lens relative parallax , and @xmath95 , together with the measured einstein timescale , @xmath96days , we obtain @xmath97 and @xmath98 the relatively high lens - source relative proper motion @xmath99 is mildly suggestive of a foreground disk lens , but still quite consistent with a bulge lens . since @xmath100 corresponds to a lens distance @xmath101 ( assuming source distance @xmath102 ) , equation ( [ eqn : mpirel ] ) implies that if the lens did lie in the foreground , then it would be a very low - mass star or a brown dwarf .    assuming that the source lies at a galactocentric distance modulus 14.52 , its dereddened color and magnitude imply that @xmath103 = ( 0.81,3.07)$ ] , making it a subgiant .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : lc ] , the principal deviations from a point - lens light curve occur at the limb of the star .",
    "this prompts us to investigate the degree to which the planetary solution is influenced by our treatment of limb darkening .",
    "the results that we report are based on a fit to the @xmath43-band surface brightness profile of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the linear and square - root parameters , respectively , and where @xmath107 is the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "see @xcite for the relation between @xmath109 and the usual @xmath110 formalism .",
    "in deriving the reported results , we fix the @xmath43-band limb - darkening parameters @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath112 from @xcite for a star with effective temperature @xmath113k and @xmath114 .",
    "these stellar parameters are suggested by comparison to yale - yonsei isochrones @xcite for the dereddened color and absolute magnitude reported in   [ sec : finitesource ] .",
    "we also perform fits in which @xmath105 and @xmath106 are allowed to be completely free . from these fits",
    ", we find that our best - fit model has @xmath115 . @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    "are highly correlated , so their individual values are not of interest , and the surface - brightness profiles generated by these two sets of @xmath109 are qualitatively similar . in the present context ,",
    "however , the key point is that when we fix the limb - darkening parameters at the @xcite values , the contours in figure  [ fig : qgamma ] remain essentially identical and the best fit values change by much less than @xmath116 .",
    "because of lower point - density and the aforementioned problems with the @xmath42 data over the peak , we only attempt a linear limb - darkening fit , i.e. , we use equation  ( [ eqn : ld ] ) with @xmath117 , and we adopt @xmath118 from @xcite .",
    "in the crowded fields of the galactic bulge , the photometered light of a microlensing event rarely comes solely from the lensed source . rather there is typically additional light that is blended with the source but",
    "is not being lensed .",
    "this light can arise from unrelated stars that happen to be projected close enough to the line of sight to be blended with the source , or it can come from companions to the source , companions to the lens , or the lens itself .",
    "this last possibility is most interesting because , if the lens flux can be isolated and measured , it provides strong constraints on the lens properties , and in this case would enable a complete solution of the lens mass and distance , when combined with the measurement of @xmath119 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to investigate the blended light , we begin by using the method of @xcite to construct an image of the field with the source ( but not the blended light ) removed , and compare this to a baseline image , which of course contains both the source and the blended light . in these images ,",
    "the source / blend is immersed in the wings of a bright star ( roughly 3.7 mag brighter than the source ) , which lies about @xmath120 away . on the baseline image ,",
    "the source / blend is noticeable against this background , but hardly distinct . on the source - subtracted image ,",
    "the blend is not directly discernible .    to make a quantitative estimate of the blend flux",
    ", we fit the region in the immediate vicinity of the bright star to the form @xmath121 , where `` psf '' is the point - spread - function determined from the dia analysis .",
    "we then subtract the best fit flux profile from the image .",
    "this leaves a clear residual at the position of the source / blend in the baseline image , but just noise in the source - subtracted image .",
    "we add all the flux in a @xmath122 square centered on the lens , finding 564 adu and @xmath123 adu , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath42-band flux blend / source ratio is @xmath124 . of course",
    ", even if we had detected blended light , it would be impossible to tell whether it was directly coincident with the source .",
    "if it were , this would imply that this light would be directly associated with the event , i.e. , being either the lens itself or a companion to the lens or the source .",
    "hence , this measurement is an upper limit on the light from the lens in two senses : no light is definitively measured , and if it were we do not know that it came from the lens . combining this limit with equation ( [ eqn : mpirel ] ) , and assuming",
    "the lens is a main - sequence star , it must then be less massive than @xmath5 , and so must have relative parallax @xmath125 .",
    "this implies a lens - source separation @xmath126 , which certainly does not exclude bulge lenses .",
    "indeed , if the lens were a k dwarf in the galactic bulge , it would saturate this limit .",
    "moa-2007-blg-400 is the first high - magnification microlensing event for which the central caustic generated by a planetary companion to the lens is completely enveloped by the source . as a comparison ,",
    "the planetary caustic of ogle-2005-blg-390 @xcite is smaller than its clump - giant source star in angular size .",
    "when the planetary caustics is covered by the source , the finite - source effects broaden the `` classic '' @xcite planetary perturbation features @xcite .",
    "by contrast , planet - induced deviations in moa-2007-blg-400 are mostly obliterated , rather than being broadened , because the source crosses the central caustic rather than the planetary caustic .",
    "we showed , nevertheless , that the planetary character of the event can be inferred directly from the light - curve features and that the standard microlensing planetary parameters @xmath127 can be measured with good precision , up to the standard close / wide @xmath60 degeneracy .",
    "we demonstrated that , in this case , the close / wide degeneracy is quite severe , and the wide solution is only preferred by @xmath128 .",
    "this is unfortunate , since the separations of the two solutions differ by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "we argued that the severity of this degeneracy was primarily related to the intrinsic parameters of the planet , rather than being primarily a result of the large source size .",
    "although the mass ratio alone is of considerable interest for planet formation theories , one would also like to be able to translate the standard microlensing parameters to physical parameters , i.e. , the planet mass @xmath129 , and planet - star projected separation @xmath130 .",
    "clearly this requires measuring the lens mass @xmath14 and distance @xmath131 . in this case , the pronounced finite source effects have already permitted a measurement of the einstein radius @xmath132 , which gives a relation between the mass and lens - source relative parallax ( eq .  [ [ eqn : mpirel ] ] ) .",
    "this essentially yields a relation between the lens mass and distance , since the source distance is close enough to the galactic center that knowing @xmath131 is equivalent to knowing @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , a complete solution could be determined by measuring either @xmath14 or @xmath131 , or some combination of the two .",
    "one way to obtain an independent relation between the lens mass and distance is to measure the microlens parallax , @xmath134 .",
    "there are two potential ways of measuring @xmath134 .",
    "first , one can measure distortions in the light curve arising from the acceleration of the earth as it moves along its orbit .",
    "unfortunately , this is out of the question in this case because the event is so short that these distortions are immeasurably small .",
    "second , one can measure the effects of terrestrial parallax , which gives rise to differences between the light curves simultaneously observed from two or more observatories separated by a significant fraction of the diameter of the earth .",
    "practically , measuring these differences requires a high - magnification event , which would appear to make this event quite promising .",
    "unfortunately , although we obtained simultaneous observations from two observatories separated by several hundred kilometers during the peak of the event , one of these datasets suffers from large systematic errors and an unknown time zero point , rendering it unusable for this purpose .",
    "the only available alternative for breaking the degeneracy between the lens mass and distance would be to measure the lens flux , either under the glare of the source or , at a later date , to separately resolve it after it has moved away from the line of sight to the source @xcite .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) of figure  [ fig : prop ] show the bayesian estimates of the lens brightness in @xmath42-band and @xmath43-band , respectively .",
    "if the lens flux is at least 2% of the source flux , then the former kind of measurement could be obtained from a single epoch _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observation , provided it were carried out in the reasonably near future . at roughly 99% probability , the blended light would be either perfectly aligned with the source ( and so associated with the event ) or well separated from it .",
    "_ hst _ images can be photometrically aligned to the ground - based images using comparison stars with an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "hence , photometry of the source+blend would detect the blend , unless it were at least 4 mag fainter than the source . in principle , the blend could be a companion to either the source or lens .",
    "various arguments can be used to constrain either of those scenarios .",
    "we do not explore those here , but see @xcite .",
    "if the lens is not detectable by current epoch _ hst _ observations ( or no _ hst _ observations are taken ) , then it will be detectable by ground - based ao @xmath43-band observations in about 5 years .",
    "this is because the lens - source relative proper motion is measured to be @xmath135 , and the diffraction limit at @xmath43 band on a 10 m telescope is roughly 35 mas .",
    "if the lens proves to be extremely faint , then a wider separation ( and hence a few years more time baseline ) would be required .    in the absence of additional observational constraints",
    ", we must rely on a bayesian analysis to estimate the properties of the host star and planet , which incorporates priors on the distribution of lens masses , distances , and velocities @xcite .",
    "this is a standard procedure , which we only briefly summarize here .",
    "we adopt a @xcite model for the galactic bar , a double - exponential disk with a scale height of 325 pc , and a scale length of 3.5 kpc , as well as other galactic model parameters as described in @xcite .",
    "we incorporate constraints from our measurement of the lens angular einstein radius @xmath119 and the event timescale , as well as limits on the microlens parallax and @xmath42-band magnitude of the lens . in practice ,",
    "only the measurements of @xmath119 and @xmath136 provide interesting constraints on these distributions .",
    "in addition , we include the small penalty on the close solution , @xmath137 , where the wide solution is favored by @xmath128 .",
    "for the estimates of the planet semimajor axis , we assume circular orbits and that the orbital phases and cos(inclinations ) are randomly distributed .",
    "the resulting probability densities for the physical properties of the host star , as well as selected properties of the planet , are shown in figure  [ fig : prop ] .",
    "the bayesian analysis suggests a host star of mass @xmath138 at distance of @xmath139 . in other words ,",
    "given the available constraints , the host is most likely an m - dwarf , probably in the foreground galactic bulge .",
    "given that the planet / star mass ratio is measured quite precisely , the probability distribution for the planet mass is essentially just a rescaled version of the probability distribution for the host star mass .",
    "we find @xmath140 .",
    "the close / wide degeneracy is apparent in the probability distribution for the semimajor axis @xmath141 .",
    "we estimate @xmath142 for the close solution , and @xmath143 for the wide solution .",
    "the equilibrium temperatures for these orbits are @xmath144 and @xmath145 for the close and wide solutions , respectively .",
    "thus our bayesian analysis suggests that this system is mostly likely a bulge mid - m - dwarf , with a jovian - mass planetary companion .",
    "the semimajor axis of the planetary companion is poorly constrained primarily because of the close / wide degeneracy , but the implied equilibrium temperatures are cooler than the condensation temperature of water .",
    "specifically we find that @xmath146 at @xmath147 level . alternatively ,",
    "if we assume the snow line is given by @xmath148 , we find for this system a snow line distance of @xmath149 , very close to the inferred semimajor axis of the close solution . thus this planet is quite likely to be located close to or beyond the snow line of the system .",
    "although we can not distinguish between the close and wide solutions for the planet separation , theoretical prejudice in the context of the core - accretion scenario would suggest that a gas - giant planet would be more likely to form just outside the snow line , thus preferring the close solution .",
    "however , we have essentially no observational constraints on the frequency and distribution of jupiter - mass planets at the separations implied by the wide solution ( @xmath9 ) , for such low - mass primaries .",
    "unfortunately , the prospects for empirically resolving the close / wide degeneracy in the future are poor .",
    "the only possible method of doing this would be to measure the radial velocity signature of the planet . given the faintness of the host star ( see  [ sec : blend ] and fig.[fig : prop ] ) , this will likely be impossible with current or near - future technology .",
    "the mere existence of a gas - giant planet orbiting a mid - m - dwarf is largely unexpected in the core - accretion scenario , as formation of such planets is thought to be inhibited in such low - mass primaries @xcite .",
    "observationally , however , although the frequency of jovian companions to m - dwarfs with @xmath150 does appear to be smaller than the corresponding frequency of such companions to fgk dwarfs @xcite , several jovian - mass companions to m dwarfs are known ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , so this system would not be unprecedented .",
    "furthermore , it must be kept in mind that the estimates of stellar ( and so planet ) mass depend on the validity of the priors , and even in this context have considerable uncertainties .",
    "most of the ambiguities in the interpretation of this event would be removed with a measurement of the host star mass and distance , which could be obtained by combining our measurement of @xmath119 with a measurement of the lens light as outlined above .",
    "the bayesian analysis informs the likelihood of success of such an endeavor .",
    "this analysis suggests that , if the host is a main - sequence star , its magnitude will be @xmath151 and @xmath152 , which corresponds to @xmath153 and @xmath154 of the source flux , respectively . if initial efforts to detect the lens fail , more aggressive observations would certainly be warranted :",
    "microlensing is the most sensitive method for detecting planets around very low - mass stars simply because it is the only method that does not rely on light from the host ( or the planet itself ) to detect the planet",
    ". and given equation  ( [ eqn : mpirel ] ) , even an m dwarf at the very bottom of the main sequence @xmath155 , would lie at @xmath156 and so would be @xmath157 .",

    "because moa-2007-blg-400 is the first microlensing event with a completely buried central caustic , it is important to rule out other potential causes of the deviations seen in the light curve ( apart from a planetary companion to the lens ) .",
    "the principal features of these deviations are the twin `` spikes '' in the residuals , which are approximately centered on the times when the lens enters and exits the source . in the model",
    ", these crossings occur at about hjd @xmath158 and hjd @xmath159 , i.e. , very close to the spikes in figure  [ fig : lc ] . in principle",
    ", one might be able to induce such spikes by displacing the model source crossing times from the true times .",
    "the only real way to achieve this ( while still optimizing the overall fit parameters ) would be if the source were actually elliptical , but were modeled as a circle ( which , of course , is the norm ) .",
    "one argument against this hypothesis is the similarity of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 residuals (   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "if the source were an ellipsoidal variable , then one would expect color gradients due to `` gravity darkening '' .",
    "nevertheless , we carried out two types of investigation of this possibility .",
    "first , we modeled the light curve as an elliptical source magnified by a point ( non - binary ) lens .",
    "in addition to the linear flux parameters ( source flux plus blended flux for each observatory ) there are 6 model parameters , the three standard point - lens parameters ( @xmath160 ) , plus the source semimajor and semiminor axes ( @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) and the angle of the source trajectory relative to the source major axis , @xmath69 . we find that the elliptical source reduces @xmath32 by about 200 , but it does not remove the `` spikes '' from the residuals , which was the primary motivation for introducing it .",
    "instead , essentially all of the @xmath32 improvement comes from eliminating the asymmetries from the rest of the light curve .",
    "recall , however , that the planetary model removes both these asymmetries and the `` spikes '' .",
    "moreover , the best - fit axis ratio is quite extreme , @xmath163 , which would produce very noticeable ellipsoidal variations unless the binary were being viewed pole on .",
    "next we looked for sinusoidal variations in the baseline light curve .",
    "the individual ogle errorbars at baseline are smaller than for moa , and since ellipsoidal variations are strictly periodic , the longer ogle baseline ( about @xmath164 days versus @xmath165 days for moa ) does a better job of isolating this signal from various possible systematics .",
    "therefore , for this purpose , the ogle data are more suitable than moa .",
    "the ogle data are essentially all baseline ( only two magnified points out of 452 ) .",
    "their periodogram shows several spikes at the 0.01 mag level , and a maximum @xmath166 , which are consistent with noise .",
    "the width of the spikes is extremely narrow , consistent with the theoretical expectation for uniformly sampled data of @xmath167 , indicating that the data set is behaving normally .    in brief",
    ", our investigation finds no convincing evidence for ellipticity of the source , certainly not for the several tens of percent deviation from circular that would be needed to significantly ameliorate the deviations seen near peak in the light curve . moreover",
    ", even arbitrary source ellipticities can not reproduce the light curve s most striking features : the two `` spikes '' in the residuals that occur when the lens crosses the source boundary ."
