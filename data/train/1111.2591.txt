    "the composite supernova remnant ( snr ) cta  1 ( g119.5 + 10.2 ) consists of a shell - type structure visible in the radio band with a center filled morphology at x - ray energies .",
    "the radio shell , of diameter @xmath0",
    "@xcite , is fainter towards the north - west ( nw ) of the remnant , possibly due to rapid expansion of the shock into a region of lower density , as supported by hi observations  @xcite .",
    "the distance to cta  1 is @xmath1 kpc , derived from the associated hi shell  @xcite .",
    "its age is estimated to be @xmath2 yr  @xcite .",
    "archival x - ray observations of cta  1 in the 5 - 10 kev band show non - thermal diffuse emission of low surface brightness in the center of the remnant , likely corresponding to a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) driven by a young pulsar  @xcite . a faint point source , , is located at the brightest part of the synchrotron emission , and was suggested as a pulsar candidate by seward  @xcite .",
    "chandra _",
    "image of this object provided further evidence of an energetic , rotation - powered pulsar , resolving a central point source , a compact nebula , and a bent jet  @xcite .",
    "the earliest association of gamma - ray emission with cta  1 comes from the detection of the source  by the  instrument , with a relatively small 95% error circle of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "brazier et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the gamma - ray emission could originate from a young geminga - like pulsar , based upon the coincidence with cta  1 , hard spectral index ( @xmath4 between 70 mev and 2 gev ) , and lack of flux variability .",
    "confirmation of this association came recently when the _ fermi _   _ gamma - ray space telescope _ discovered the radio - quiet , 316.86 ms gamma - ray pulsar  in a blind search , using 0.14 years of data  @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations by _ xmm - newton _  resulted in the detection of pulsed x - ray emission out of phase with the gamma - ray pulsation  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the spin - down power of the pulsar ( @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 ) and characteristic age ( @xmath7  yrs ) confirmed estimates based on previous observations observations  @xcite .",
    "prompted by the discovery of  by _ fermi _ , zhang  @xcite modeled the pulsed and unpulsed spectral components of the pulsar magnetosphere and pwn .",
    "the pulsed high - energy spectrum was calculated with an outer - gap model and fit to the  spectrum of brazier et al .",
    "the unpulsed spectrum of the pwn was calculated with a time - dependent , broken power law injection model with non - thermal emission from synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and ambient infrared ( ir ) photons .",
    "these calculations predict that the pwn should be detectable in the very - high - energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray band by _ veritas_.",
    "the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( _ veritas _ ) is an array of four 12-meter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescapes ( iacts ) located at the base camp of the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona .",
    "each telescope consists of a davies - cotton design optical reflector which focuses the cherenkov light from atmospheric showers onto a camera consisting of 499 photomulitplier tubes and light concentrators with a total fov of 3@xmath8 .",
    "_ veritas _  is able to detect a point source with the strength of 1% of the crab nebula flux at a statistical significance of 5 standard deviation ( 5@xmath9 ) level in approximately 26 hours of observations .",
    "_  is sensitive to gamma rays over a wide range of energies ( 100  gev to tens of tev ) with an energy resolution of 15 - 20% .    _",
    "veritas _  observed cta  1 between september 2010 to january 2011 with a total livetime of approximately 26 hours , after selection for good weather conditions and hardware status .",
    "observations were taken in `` wobble '' mode @xcite , in which the telescope pointing is offset from the source position by some angular distance .",
    "an offset distance of 0.7@xmath10 was used to accommodate the large size of the remnant and the extension of the pwn as seen in x - rays .",
    "two sets of _ a priori _ defined gamma - ray / hadronic shower separation cuts , optimized for weak sources of moderate and hard spectra , were applied to the data .",
    "background was estimated using the ring background model ( see , for example , @xcite ) , with squared angular integration radii of 0.01 deg@xmath11 and 0.055 deg@xmath11 used for point - source and extended - source searches , respectively .",
    "the statistical significance of the excess is calculated using equation ( 17 ) from li & ma  @xcite .      .",
    "the radio contours at 1420 mhz are overlaid in black , showing the snr shell .",
    "the green lines show the _ veritas _   significance contours at 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the position of the pulsar is given by the pink circle  @xcite .",
    "the circle at the lower left corner shows the size of the _ veritas _",
    "psf ( 68% containment ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : cta1_multi_map ] shows the map of excess events in the region around cta  1 as measured by _ veritas_. the hard - spectrum , extended - source analysis produced an excess with a pre - trial significance of @xmath12 , in a blind search region of radius @xmath13 around the pulsar , within the radio shell of the snr cta  1 .",
    "accounting for the sets of cuts and integration radii , and implementing a trails factor for the search region by tiling it with @xmath14 square bins @xcite , we conservatively estimate a post - trials significance of detection of @xmath15 .",
    "the tev gamma - ray emission region exceeds the point - spread function ( psf ; measured from analysis of the crab nebula ) of _ veritas _ , as seen in figure  [ fig : cta1_multi_map ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cta1rosat ] shows the  x - ray image of the region around cta  1 , overlaid with the _ veritas _  significance contours .",
    "the  image reveals a center - filled morphology and faint compact source .",
    "the _ veritas _",
    "excess is roughly centered on the location of , which may be indicative of a young pwn , as opposed to older  relic \" pwne which have been offset from the pulsar by an interaction with the snr reverse shock  @xcite .",
    "are shown in black .",
    "the _ veritas _  excess is seen to line up with location of pulsar . ]    a preliminary spectral analysis gives an integral flux above 1 tev of @xmath16 of the flux from the crab nebula .",
    "( final spectral analysis and flux estimates will be given in a forthcoming paper  @xcite . ) using the distance of 1.4  kpc , we estimate the luminosity ( @xmath17 ) to compare with other pwne and pwne candidates detected at tev energies .",
    "[ fig : cta1_edotvsage ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cta1_lgvsage ] present the results of these comparisons , following the work of kargaltsev and pavlov  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : cta1_edotvsage ] shows the relative luminosities of pwne in the tev and x - ray bands , as functions of spin down power and characteristic age .",
    "it is seen that tev pwne are generally found around younger , more energetic pulsars , although the tev luminosities do not depend on the pulsar age as strongly as x - ray pwn luminosities do .",
    "[ fig : cta1_lgvsage ] shows the distance - independent ratio of tev gamma - ray luminosity to x - ray luminosity versus the characteristic age .",
    "the tev luminosity of a pwn reflects cumulative pulsar wind properties integrated over a significant fraction of the young pulsar s lifetime while the x - ray luminosity characterizes the freshly injected pulsar wind , which might explain the hint of flattening at larger ages .",
    "again , cta  1 fits nicely in the middle of the tev / x - ray pwn population , suggesting that the tev emission is indeed due to the pwn .",
    "_ veritas _  has detected extended tev emission within the composite snr cta 1 at a @xmath18 post - trials significance level in approximately 26 hours of observation .",
    "the gamma - ray excess lines up with the gamma - ray pulsar , and its x - ray pwn .",
    "preliminary spectral analysis shows an integral flux above 1 tev at 4% of the crab nebula flux , and the properties of this new tev source seem consistent with those for the known tev / x - ray pwn population , lending support to its identification with the pwn of cta 1 .",
