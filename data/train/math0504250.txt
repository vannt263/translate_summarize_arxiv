    "different information measures , and in particular , the shannon entropy , has found application in many branches of science . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the uncertainty in the localization of a particle in ordinary space is quantitatively measured by the so - called position information entropy @xmath11 of the probability density @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wavefunction of its dynamical state .",
    "this functional leads , for instance , to a stronger version of the celebrated heisenberg s uncertainty principle , a fundamental law of nature @xcite .",
    "this fact and the effective implementation of the density functional theory of complex many - electron systems @xcite , which uses the single - particle density as the basic variable , are responsible for the fact that the study of the entropy has become a standard tool in atomic and molecular physics , and in condensed matter theories .",
    "the exact or explicit determination of the information entropies of complex many - particle systems is an extremely difficult problem .",
    "only recently a small progress has been achieved yielding in some cases closed formulas for the information entropies of the simplest 1-dimensional single - particle systems and the three - dimensional systems of particles moving in a central or spherically symmetric potential .",
    "for these systems the wavefunctions are expressible in terms of some special functions , and the determination of the corresponding information entropies boils down naturally to the computation of entropic functionals for sequences of orthogonal polynomials ( cf.@xcite ; a state - of - the art of this topic up to 2001 is given in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , given a positive unit itegrable weight @xmath3 on @xmath4 $ ] , and the sequence of corresponding orthonormal polynomials @xmath14 , we may define the shannon entropy of these polynomials either as @xmath15 or as @xmath16 they are obviously related by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 hence , we are faced with two different problems .",
    "one is the explicit computation of  for fixed @xmath7 s ( either as a closed formula or numerically ) .",
    "observe that a naive evaluation of these functionals by means of quadratures encounters the difficulty of the zeros of @xmath6 , that belong to the interval of orthogonality .",
    "some of the contributions in this sense are @xcite .",
    "a second problem is the study of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 when @xmath22 , which has a special interest in the analysis of the highly - excited ( rydberg ) states of numerous quantum - mechanical systems @xcite . in this sense",
    "there have been important contributions in the last few years @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors have studied the asymptotic behavior of these functionals under the assumption that the weight of orthogonality satisfies the szeg condition , @xmath23 under an additional assumption on the growth of the polynomials on the interval of orthogonality they proved that both @xmath10 and @xmath24 ( and in consequence , also @xmath25 ) converge , and @xmath26 ( notice that @xmath24 is taken here with a slightly different normalization than in @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite conjectured that the limit in is valid for a larger class of weights ; from their work it follows also that if @xmath27 on @xmath28 does not satisfy , then @xmath29 and @xmath30 diverge to @xmath31 .",
    "the pollaczek polynomials constitute the first and the best known example of a family of orthogonal polynomials on @xmath4 $ ] with respect to a weight _ not satisfying _ the szeg condition . in this paper",
    "we deal with the _ symmetric _ pollaczek polynomials , @xmath32 , that depend on two real parameters , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and that may be defined by the recurrence relation @xmath35 with the coefficients @xmath36 it is known ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ) that these polynomials are orthonormal on @xmath37 $ ] with respect to the unitary weight function @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the gamma function . from it is clear that pollaczek polynomials @xmath40 ( that is , for @xmath41 ) reduce to orthonormal gegenbauer polynomials with parameter @xmath42 . in the sequel ,",
    "whenever it can not lead us into confusion , we omit the explicit reference to the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the notation of the polynomials .",
    "our main goal is to study the asymptotic behavior of the sequences @xmath29 , @xmath44 and @xmath30 as @xmath0 , when @xmath3 is the symmetric pollaczek weight .",
    "we can summarize our main results saying that limit is proved to be valid also for @xmath45 , with the restriction @xmath46 ( so , this fact extends beyond the szeg class , as conjectured ) , and we find the main part of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , up to the @xmath47 terms .",

    "unfortunately , the assumptions from @xcite on the behavior of @xmath3 at @xmath72 are not fulfilled by the symmetric pollaczek weights .",

    "we should observe however that the result in @xcite is sharp : there the @xmath47 term of has a power decay , fact which is not true for the pollaczek weight , where the decay is logarithmic .",

    "both measures are standard objects of study in the analytic theory of orthogonal polynomials .",
