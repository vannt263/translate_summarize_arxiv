    "entangled states of macroscopic objects , especially of _ massive _ objects , are vital for the study of the quantum - to - classical transition  @xcite , wave - function collapse theories  @xcite and gravitational quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement between massive objects is hard to prepare since large - scale objects are more affected by various environmental noises and have also stronger internal interactions . besides",
    ", gravitationally induced decoherence  @xcite may also play its role in degrading the superposition and entanglement of massive objects .",
    "recently , it has been shown that self - gravity of a macroscopic mechanical object may affect the quantum dynamics of its center - of - mass motion  @xcite , and , as a result , it may affect the entanglement of the motional states of two or more large objects .",
    "at the mesoscopic / macroscopic level , entanglement has been demonstrated in various systems : e.g. , in two atomic ensembles  @xcite , in two josephson - junction qubits  @xcite , and in an electro - mechanical system  @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement between two mechanical resonators ( mrs ) has been demonstrated only at the microscopic level , in the case of two trapped ions  @xcite , and between two single - phonon excitations in nanodiamonds  @xcite .",
    "optomechanics , addressing the coupling of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom via radiation pressure , provides an ideal platform to prepare quantum states in mechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "many schemes have been put forward for the generation of entanglement between two mrs utilizing optomechanical and/or electromechanical systems : e.g. , by exploiting radiation pressure  @xcite , the squeezing of optical field  @xcite , the conditional measurements on light modes  @xcite , mechanical nonlinearities  @xcite and parametric driving  @xcite .",
    "recently , reservoir engineering ideas  @xcite have been applied to optomechanical scenarios by exploiting properly chosen multi - frequency drivings . in such a way , large and robust entanglement between two mrs could be achieved either dynamically or in the steady state  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have been used to generate entangled pairs of mrs in a harmonic chain  @xcite and cluster states of a large number of mrs  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to further improve the results obtained in the scheme @xcite by introducing a coherent feedback loop  @xcite . differently from the conventional measurement",
    "based feedback  @xcite , the non - measurement based , hence backaction free , coherent feedback shows advantages in many aspects : e.g. , in cooling  @xcite and suppressing noises  @xcite of mrs , in squeezing optical field  @xcite , in entangling optical modes  @xcite and quantum nodes  @xcite , in engineering nonlinear effects  @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , up to now , to the best of our knowledge , it has not been studied how such a feedback affects the entanglement of two macroscopic mrs , which is exactly the theme of this paper .",
    "the scheme  @xcite shares similarity with the one provided in  @xcite .",
    "however , the former is believed more compact and experimental friendly in the sense that a four - tone driving is not required for the most general case of _ unequal _ single - photon optomechanical couplings  @xcite .",
    "the protocol  @xcite optimally works in a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) regime where counter - rotating , non - resonant terms associated with the bichromatic driving are negligible , which requries that the cavity decay rate @xmath0 is much smaller than the two mechanical frequencies @xmath1 and their difference @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "this may limit the applications of the scheme  @xcite because typically the frequency of mechanical systems is not large .",
    "we show that by including coherent feedback , in which a portion of the cavity output field is returned to the input port , the effective cavity decay rate can be significantly reduced and the entanglement can be largely enhanced , and hence the condition for taking the rwa in ref .",
    "@xcite is greatly relaxed , extending largely the validity of the protocol .",
    "the feedback loop contains a controllable beamsplitter ( cbs )  @xcite which adjusts , by altering its reflectivity , how much of the output light is sent back into the input port .",
    "this is important for the generation of entanglement because there exist optimal values , depending on specific system parameters , of the reflectivity of the cbs and of the ratio of two effective optomechanical couplings @xmath4 , which yield maxima of the entanglement .",
    "we show that both steady - state and dynamical entanglement , achieved respectively for @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite , can be remarkably enhanced .",
    "this is more notable for the dynamic case and for the system at low environmental thermal excitations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ system ]",
    "we first provide the system hamiltonian and its corresponding quantum langevin equations ( qles ) without coherent feedback .",
    "we then include the feedback loop and derive the modified qles , from which one sees clearly the effects of the feedback , which make it possible to largely improve the entanglement of the two mrs . in section  [ results ] , we present the results and compare the entanglement between the two mrs in the two cases with and without coherent feedback .",
    "it shows that remarkable improvement of the entanglement could be achieved by the feedback in both of the dynamic and steady state cases .",
    "we also study the effect of the light phase shift in the feedback loop on the entanglement .",
    "finally , we make our conclusions in section  [ conc ] .",
    "and @xmath7 .",
    "large and robust entanglement between the two mrs can be generated either dynamically or in the steady state .",
    "the output field of the cavity is fed back into the input port through highly reflective mirrors ( hrm ) and a controllable beamsplitter ( cbs ) with tunable reflection coefficient @xmath8 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote vacuum noises entering into the system through the cbs and the output cavity mirror , respectively.,width=316 ]    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we consider an optical cavity mode with resonance frequency @xmath11 which is bichromatically driven at the two frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath7 , with the reference frequency @xmath13 detuned from the cavity resonance by @xmath14 . the cavity mode is interacting via optomechanical interaction with two different mrs with frequencies @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the system hamiltonian , in a reference frame rotating at the frequency @xmath13 , is given by @xmath17 } , \\end{split } \\label{haml}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the annihilation operators of the cavity mode and the mechanical modes , respectively , and @xmath20 is the single - photon optomechanical coupling to the @xmath21-th mr .",
    "this means that the cavity mode is simultaneously driven on the blue sideband associated with the mr with frequency @xmath15 , and on the red sideband associated with the mr with frequency @xmath16 .",
    "since the cavity is strongly pumped , the system dynamics can be effectively studied by linearizing the optomechanical interaction . in this case , the average fields for both the cavity , @xmath22 , and the mechanical degrees of freedom , @xmath23 , are large , and one can simplify the interaction hamiltonian at the lowest order in the field fluctuations @xmath24 and @xmath25 . differently from the typical optomechanical systems in which the steady state average fields are time - independent , here",
    "the bichromatic driving induces a time - dependent , periodic steady state average field which , in turn , implies time - dependent effective coupling strengths for the linearized dynamics of the fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "1.1cm*(a)*6.2cm*(b ) * + 0.4 cm 0.1 cm + 1.09cm*(c)*6.2cm*(d ) * +      in what follows , we first provide the qles for the case without considering coherent feedback , and we then add the coherent feedback loop and write the modified qles . by comparing the two sets of the qles , we will see clearly the effects of the feedback , which results in an improvement of the entanglement .",
    "the qles including noise terms without feedback , in the interaction picture with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath26 , are given by  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the cavity decay rates due to the transmission through the two cavity mirrors , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the damping rates of the two mechanical modes , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the ( generally complex ) effective optomechanical couplings , expressed as @xmath34 @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are the input noise operators ( in the case with feedabck , @xmath37 in turn becomes the input field operator for the cavity ) associated with the cavity mode ( mechanical modes ) , whose only nonzero correlation functions are @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41^{-1}$ ] the mean thermal phonon number of the @xmath21-th mr , which is assumed to stay at the same environmental temperature @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the effective cavity detuning which includes the frequency shift induced by the optomechanical interaction , proportional to the dc component of the average mechanical oscillation amplitude @xmath23 ( see appendix b in ref .",
    "the above qles are derived by neglecting the non - resonant time - dependent terms of the effective linearized interactions , which is justified when @xmath44 in practice @xmath45 can be easily satisfied by lowering the power of the lasers .",
    "however , @xmath0 can not take very small values bounded by the finesse of the cavity , which limits the applications of the scheme  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show below , by including a coherent feedback loop ( green lines in fig.[fig1 ] ) the effective cavity decay rate can be significantly reduced and therefore the condition @xmath46 is greatly relaxed . the feedback loop is straightforward and it sends the output field of the cavity through a cbs ( with tunable reflectivity ) back into the input port .",
    "we shall work in the limit of instantaneous feedback , which is a very good approximation since in optomechanical systems , typically the mechanical frequency is not large . considering a 5 cm cavity with a 10 cm feedback loop ,",
    "the delay time is @xmath47 s , which is much smaller than a period of mechanical oscillation , e.g. @xmath48 s with frequency 10 mhz .",
    "therefore , the effect of time delay in the feedback loop on the mechanical modes could be safely neglected .",
    "the output field is obtained using the standard input - output formula  @xcite @xmath49 the cavity output is then sent into one input port of the cbs with vacuum entering into the other input port , and thus one of the output field operator of the cbs , which in turn becomes the input field operator for the cavity , is obtained @xmath50 where @xmath8 and @xmath51 are the ( generally complex ) reflection and transmission coefficients , @xmath52 for a bs without absorption , and @xmath53 is the vacuum noise operator , which has only a nonzero correlation function @xmath54 .",
    "it should be noted that , in writing eq .",
    "we have included all the possible losses ( e.g. due to the transmission of the highly reflective mirrors ) and phase shift ( due to the reflection and propagation ) of the light in the feedback loop into the complex reflection coefficient of the cbs , @xmath55 . in other words , here",
    "@xmath56 is interpreted as the real reflection coefficient of the cbs minus additional losses in the feedback loop , which means that in eq .",
    "@xmath56 can not take unity , but only approaches it , @xmath57 . inserting eqs .   and into eq .",
    ", we obtain the modified qle for the cavity mode , which is @xmath58 it takes a simpler form when the two decay rates @xmath59 are assumed equal , @xmath60 , given by @xmath61\\delta \\hat{a}{-}i g_1 \\delta \\hat{b}_1^\\dagger { -}i g_2 \\delta \\hat{b}_2   \\\\ & + \\sqrt{2\\kappa}(1{- } e^{i \\theta } |r_b| ) \\,\\hat{a}_2^{\\rm in}+\\!\\!\\sqrt{2\\kappa } t_b \\,\\hat{a}_0^{\\rm in}. \\end{split } \\label{newqle}\\ ] ] by comparing with the equation without feedback , we see that due to the coherent feedback the cavity decay rate can be significantly reduced , @xmath62 , when @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , and the effective detuning is also modified , @xmath66 . moreover , the vacuum noises entering into the cavity can be deeply suppressed .",
    "this is clearly seen by looking at the correlation function of the combined noise operator @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the diffusion rate associated with the vacuum noises .",
    "we see that the diffusion rate is also significantly reduced when @xmath63 and @xmath70 .",
    "the above two facts make it possible to improve remarkably the entanglement between the two mrs .",
    "however , it is not true that for the generation of entanglement one should consider the reflectivity of the cbs as large as possible . as we will show later , there is an optimal value of the reflectivity @xmath8 , depending on system parameters ( especially on thermal noises ) , which gives rise to the maximum entanglement .",
