    "the structure of the qcd phase diagram is one of the fundamental problems addressed in both theoretical and experimental studies @xcite . at finite chemical potential ,",
    "the existence of a critical point ( cp ) has been conjectured , based on effective chiral models @xcite and preliminary lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of conserved charges , have been proposed as a signature for the conjectured cp @xcite . however , in this paper we focus on the qcd phase transition at small net baryon densities .",
    "it was conjectured by pisarski and wilczek @xcite that for massless light quarks , the qcd phase transition is of the second order , belonging to the @xmath0 universality class .",
    "current lattice qcd simulations at physical quark masses show , that at vanishing baryon density the transition from a hadron gas to quark matter is of the crossover type @xcite .",
    "this implies that the corresponding singularity in the thermodynamic observables is shifted to complex values of the baryon chemical potential  @xcite and the experimental signatures of the phase transition could be washed out .",
    "the conjecture of pisarski and wilczek is supported by recent lattice qcd studies  @xcite , which show that for physical values of the light quark masses , the magnetic equation of state of qcd is consistent with the @xmath0 scaling .",
    "this result has opened new opportunities to verify the qcd phase boundary experimentally by measuring fluctuations of conserved charges @xcite .",
    "indeed , based on the residual @xmath0 criticality and the proximity of the chiral crossover transition to the freeze - out line in heavy ion collisions , the characteristic modifications of the fluctuations of conserved charges have been proposed as a signature for the qcd phase boundary at small net baryon densities @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , that at the chiral crossover transition , the higher order cumulants of the net baryon number and electric charge can be negative , owing to the @xmath0 scaling @xcite .",
    "such cumulants have recently been explored in heavy ion collisions by star collaboration @xcite .",
    "the data show deviations from the skellam distribution , which are qualitatively consistent with theoretical expectations based on the @xmath0 chiral critical dynamics .",
    "we note , however , that the role of uncertainties associated with the event - by - event measurements of fluctuations remain to be clarified @xcite .",
    "cumulants of net charges have also been studied in first principle lattice qcd calculations @xcite , as well as in effective chiral models @xcite .",
    "their properties are consistent with general expectations based on the @xmath0 scaling free energy .    fluctuations of conserved charges are directly linked to the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "thus , the critical properties of cumulants of conserved charges must also be reflected in the probability distribution .",
    "recently , the effects of the chiral phase transition on the net baryon number probability distribution was examined within the framework of mean - field theory and the scaling theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it was found , that the critical behavior of the cumulants is a consequence of the change of the corresponding probability distribution . in the present work ,",
    "we extend our previous studies to a more realistic model .",
    "we consider the two - flavor quark - meson model which is a low energy effective theory for the chiral properties of qcd .",

    "is neglected . however , within the frg approach , the @xmath0 scaling behavior and thermodynamics near the cp are well described by this model @xcite .",
    "we show that there is a substantial influence of the underlying chiral phase transition on the properties of the probability distribution .",
    "in particular , we find that for a physical pion mass , the distribution which includes the effect of mesonic fluctuations , differs considerably from both , the mean - field and skellam distributions .",
    "the latter is considered as a reference for a non - critical behavior .",
    "a characteristic feature of the net quark number probability distribution is that in the vicinity of a chiral crossover transition of the @xmath0 universality class , it is narrower than the corresponding mean - field and skellam distributions .",

    "to unravel the influence of chiral transition on the probability distribution @xmath57 , one needs to establish a reference distribution , which does not include the effect of critical fluctuations . at low temperatures , @xmath85 ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential is expected to be well described as a quasi - ideal quark gas with a dynamically generated temperature - dependent mass .",
    "consequently , at fixed @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the natural reference for @xmath57 is the probability distribution of an ideal gas of particles and antiparticles , i.e. the skellam distribution @xcite .",
    "the skellam distribution is then determined entirely by the mean number of quarks @xmath86 and antiquarks @xmath87 , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",

    "the @xmath84 corresponds to the peak position of the chiral susceptibility , which in the frg and mf calculations are located at 214 mev and 190 mev , respectively .",
    "the probability distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn_tc ] are calculated for different volumes and at fixed temperature .",
    "there is a clear change of distributions with the volume as a consequence of a linear dependence of the variance on @xmath60 .",
    "the probability distribution also changes rapidly as the temperature is lowered from the pseudocritical point . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn_tdep ] , at a given volume , the distributions are narrower at smaller temperatures .",
    "this is due to growing mass of quarks , which together with decreasing temperature , imply decreasing mean number of quarks and antiquarks , and consequently the width of the distribution .",
    "the influence of the criticality on the net - quark number probability distribution , and the differences between the mf and the frg dynamics , are particularly transparent when comparing the results with the non - critical skellam function .",
    "figures [ fig : pn_tc ] and [ fig : pn_tdep ] show , that near @xmath84 , both the mf and the frg distributions are narrower than their skellam counterparts .",
    "such reduction of the width of the probability distribution compared to the skellam distribution was already seen in results obtained previously in the landau theory of phase transitions when critical fluctuation is included to give negative higher order cumulants  @xcite .",

    "coincides with the skellam distribution , while in the frg calulations , the two distributions differ at all temperatures . the increasing difference between the frg and skellam distributions , as the temperature approaches @xmath84 , reflects the growing influence of mesonic fluctuaions leading to the @xmath0 criticality .     and",

    "the effect of fermi statistics is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] with the dynamical quark mass obtained in the frg approach .",
    "the probability distribution of the free fermi gas is seen to be narrower than the corresponding skellam function , but still broader than the @xmath57 of the quark - meson model in the frg approach .",
    "we identify the residual effect , i.e.  the difference between the fermi gas and the frg distributions , as being due to the mesonic fluctuations implying the @xmath0 criticality near the chiral crossover transition .",
    "on the other hand , in the mf approach at @xmath103 , the net - quark probability distribution was found to be slightly broader than the corresponding distribution obtained for a free fermi gas .",
    "therefore , in the mf approach , the apparently narrower distribution than the skellam , is due to the quantum statistics effects .",
    "thus , there is a clear difference in the properties of the net - quark distributions obtained under mf and the frg approach .",
    "the mesonic fluctuations result in a shrinking of the distribution , whereas the mf critical dynamics results in a broadening of the distribution , relatively to the non - singular fermi gas reference , as shown in @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the net - quark number are quantified by the corresponding cumulants @xmath58 , which in turn reflect critical fluctuations .",

    "the cumulants in eq .   can be also obtained from the probability distribution @xmath57 , through the central moments , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are given then as polynomials in @xmath112 . at vanishing chemical potential",

    "is infinite . in practice , however , @xmath102 is always finite .",
    "thus , the cumulants obtained from eqs .  - are , in most cases , approximations to the exact results obtained from eq .  . figure  [ fig : comps ] shows different ratios of cumulants for the skellam distribution , calculated for fixed mean number of quarks and antiquarks , from eqs .  - for different @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , to reproduce exact results @xmath114 , one needs @xmath57 for a sufficiently large @xmath115 .",
    "this value increases with the order of the cumulant , and also depends on the volume , temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "figure [ mom24 ] shows different cumulants obtained in the quark - meson model within the frg approach from eq .   and their approximate values computed from eqs .  - as functions of temperature , for several values of @xmath102 . for comparison ,",
    "the cumulants obtained from the corresponding skellam distribution are also shown in this figure .",
    "one notes , that @xmath116 and @xmath117 of the skellam and frg distributions differ , while @xmath118 agrees for temperatures well below @xmath84 .",
    "this behavior can be linked to the @xmath51dependence of a dynamical quark mass , which at @xmath85 saturates as the fourth order polynomial in @xmath51 , which is not included in the calculations of @xmath111 from the skellam function .",
    "the convergence properties of the cumulants with @xmath102 in the quark - meson model are similar to those found for the skellam distribution .",
    "the value of @xmath102 needed to obtain a good approximation , grows with the order of the cumulant .",
    "this reflects the fact , that cumulants of higher order are more sensitive to tail of the distribution . for the parameter set",
    "used in fig .",
    "[ mom24 ] , all cumulants up to the sixth order are well reproduced with @xmath119 .",
    "this also confirms consistency of the calculation of @xmath57 within the quark - meson model .    at @xmath120 , the second and",
    "the fourth order cumulants are not influenced by the critical chiral dynamics , since they remain finite , even in the chiral limit .",
    "thus , their properties are entirely determined by the regular part of the partition function .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , seen in fig .",
    "[ mom24 ] , is essentially that of an ideal quark gas , with a modified dispersion relation by @xmath59 and @xmath51dependence of a dynamical quark mass .",
    "in contrast , the temperature dependence of @xmath123 , and in particular its negative values near @xmath84 , seen in fig .",
    "[ mom24 ] , are universal .",
    "the characteristic shape of @xmath123 is generic for the @xmath0 universality class , owing to the form of the scaling function @xcite .",
    "the sixth order cumulant obtained from the non - critical skellam distribution , exhibits a very different behavior .",
    "it is interesting to note , that already for moderate values of @xmath102 , the @xmath0 shape of @xmath123 is qualitatively reproduced from the probability distribution .",
    "this result is of interest for the event - by - event analysis of heavy - ion collisions , where one expects to see the @xmath0 criticality by reconstructing the higher order moments from the measured net - charge probability distribution @xcite .",
    "the deviations of the approximate cumulants @xmath124 , obtained from the probability distribution - , from their exact values @xmath125 , given by eq .  , depend on the volume of the system .",
    "the relative deviations of @xmath124 from @xmath125 at fixed @xmath59 for different @xmath60 , however , obey the approximate scaling relations .",
    "this is transparent from fig .",
    "[ mom2 ] , showing the relative difference , @xmath126 for @xmath127 , as a function of @xmath128 . for @xmath129",
    "there is a clear scaling for all @xmath102 . for higher order cumulants ,",
    "the approximate scaling becomes better for larger values of @xmath128 .",

    "[ mom2 ] , should be also reflected in the net quark number probability distributions .",
    "indeed , figure  [ mom46 ] shows , that for fixed @xmath59 , the @xmath130 scales approximately with @xmath131 .",
    "this approximate scaling is valid for @xmath57 , calculated in the quark - meson model within the frg and mf approach , as well as , for the corresponding skellam distributions .",
    "figure  [ mom46 ] indicates , that the shape of the distribution reflects the underlying criticality in a system which is governed by the critical exponents .",
    "the probability distribution in the mf case is broader than in the frg approach , owing to differences caused by the mesonic fluctuations .",
    "as they smoothen the transition , the resultant dynamical quark mass is heavier than the mf case at the same @xmath132 @xcite , leading to narrower distribution .",
    "we have studied the properties of the probability distribution @xmath57 of the net quark number in the presence of the critical chiral dynamics governed by the @xmath0 universality class in the quark - meson model .",
    "the computations of @xmath57 have been done within the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach , which preserves the @xmath0 scaling of relevant physical observables .",
    "we have shown , by comparing the frg and the mean - field ( mf ) results , that the shape of the distribution reflects the criticality in a system . the frg distribution is narrower than the one obtained in the mf approximation .",
    "this is mainly due to differences in the values of dynamically generated quark mass .",
    "effects of the expected @xmath0 criticality appear in the tail of the distribution and imply characteristic shapes of the higher order cumulants .    near the chiral crossover transition ,",
    "the probability distribution of the net quark number was also shown to be narrower than the skellam function , which corresponds to a classical quasiparticle gas and is used as a reference for the non - critical distribution .",
    "the narrowing of the probability distribution is mainly due to mesonic fluctuations .",
    "however , owing to dropping quark mass near the chiral transition also quantum statistics play a role , although a sub - leading one .",
    "the observed shrinking of @xmath57 relative to the skellam distribution is also expected in the @xmath133 universality class .",
    "this is because , the scaling functions in the @xmath0 and @xmath133 universality classes are very similar @xcite and exhibit negative values of the specific heat critical exponents @xmath134 .",
    "however , since @xmath134 in @xmath133 is larger than in @xmath0 universality class , one expects quantitative differences in the properties of @xmath57 .",
    "we have found an approximate scaling of the probability distribution and of the net charge cumulants with the volume of the system .",
    "this implies , that the observed properties of @xmath57 near the chiral transition are volume independent , and are due to mesonic fluctuations implying @xmath0 criticality near the chiral crossover transition .",
