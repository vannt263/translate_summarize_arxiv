    "eversince its original proposal more than three decades ago , inflation has continued to be the most efficient scenario to overcome the horizon and the flatness problems associated with the conventional , hot big bang model .",
    "additionally , inflation also provides an efficient mechanism for sowing the seeds of the density perturbations in the early universe  @xcite . over the last few years",
    ", observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by missions such as the wilkinson s microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite have provided us with observational bounds on the parameters that describe the power spectra of the primordial perturbations .",
    "currently , apart from the strong constraints on the primordial scalar amplitude and the spectral index , there also exists an upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "clearly , the primordial power spectra generated by inflation must be consistent with these observational constraints .",
    "the simplest mechanism to achieve inflation consists of a canonical scalar field ( referred to as the inflaton ) which rolls down slowly towards the minima of its potential .",
    "the perturbations originating from such a scalar field produces an almost scale independent power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "such a primordial spectrum , along with a suitable choice of parameters to describe the background @xmath6cdm model , is found to lead to a cmb angular power spectrum which fits the available observational data quite well .",
    "in fact , despite the constantly improving bounds , one finds that there exist many inflationary models that remain consistent with the observations .",
    "however , there exist a few points ( notably near the multipoles of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in the wmap data  @xcite , which lie outside the cosmic variance associated with the best fit theoretical curve corresponding to the cmb angular power spectra generated by slow roll inflation .",
    "though such outliers are few in number , demanding a better fit to these data points can , obviously , lead to a more favored model of inflation .",
    "several attempts have been made to construct inflationary potentials that lead to wiggles in the primordial power spectrum ( which , in turn , cause corresponding oscillations in the cmb angular power spectrum ) , thereby resulting in an improved fit to the data when compared to the featureless power spectra produced by slow roll inflation  @xcite .",
    "the wiggles can be generated if the inflaton goes through a step or a bump in the potential .",
    "the presence of a step or a bump leads to a period of fast roll , which then leaves its imprints on the slow roll parameters and the power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "apart from constructing specific models that are more favored by the data , there has also been a few efforts towards a model independent reconstruction of the primordial scalar power spectrum from the observed cmb angular power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "importantly , such reconstructions too seem to support the presence of features in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "although the reconstruction efforts suggest that the features in the scalar power spectrum are typically localized over certain scales , it has been found that , oscillatory potentials which generate features on all scales also provide a much better fit to the cmb data than the nearly scale invariant power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it may be worth mentioning here that inflationary models leading to features also gain importance due to the fact that they can generate large levels of non - gaussianity as is possibly indicated by the wmap data ( in this context , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "evidently , any significant change in the primordial power spectrum will correspondingly modify the matter power spectrum evaluated today .",
    "hence , the features in the scalar perturbation spectrum that we mentioned above will affect the matter power spectrum which , in turn , will leave its signatures on the formation rates of the dark matter halos .",
    "the effects of steps or oscillations in the inflaton potential on the predicted number of halos was recently investigated based on the perturbation spectrum evaluated using the slow roll approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , the slow roll parameters can often turn large in such inflationary potentials and , as a result , the power spectrum evaluated in the slow roll approximation can differ considerably from the actual power spectrum .",
    "moreover , with the ever increasing quality of the large scale structure observations , in particular , the halo power spectrum constructed using the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) from the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite , it would be a worthwhile exercise to actually compare the models with the available data to arrive at additional constraints ( i.e. apart from those obtained from the cmb data ) on the primordial features .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize a recently developed and accurate fortran  90 code to _ exactly _ evaluate the inflationary perturbation spectrum , and thereby the corresponding matter power spectrum and the number of halos formed .",
    "we compute the number densities and the formation rates of halos in a couple of inflationary models that are known to lead to certain features in the power spectrum and also an improved fit to the cmb data",
    ". our goal will be to estimate the maximum possible change in the number density and the formation rate of halos in these models , when compared with , say , inflation driven by the simplest quadratic potential . in order to arrive at the parameter space of interest",
    ", we shall compare the models with the cmb as well as the large scale structure data .",
    "specifically , we shall make use of the wmap seven year ( wmap-@xmath10 ) data  @xcite and the lrg halo power spectrum data from sdss dr7  @xcite .",
    "we find that the power spectra with features corresponding to the best fit values of the inflationary parameters do not typically lead to substantial deviations in the formation rates of halos .",
    "however , we find that , in certain models that we consider , the potential parameters that lie within @xmath4-@xmath5 of the best fit values obtained from the joint constraints of the wmap and the sdss data can lead to a @xmath0@xmath1 change in the number of halos formed for halo masses ranging over @xmath2@xmath11 .    this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we shall quickly describe the inflationary potentials of interest , which lead to specific features in the primordial scalar power spectrum .",
    "we shall also outline the method that we adopt to compare the models with the data . in section  [ sec :",
    "formalism ] , we shall outline the formalism to arrive at the matter power spectra and the halo formation rates from the inflationary power spectra . in section  [ sec : nm ] , we shall provide a few essential details concerning the numerical procedures that we follow .",
    "we shall discuss the results in section  [ sec : results ] , and we shall close with a few concluding remarks regarding the wider implications of our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "note that we shall assume the background cosmological model to be the standard , spatially flat , @xmath6cdm model .",
    "in this section , we shall quickly sketch a few essential points concerning the scalar power spectrum generated during inflation . we shall also discuss the inflationary models of our interest and the scalar power spectra produced by them .",
    "further , we shall outline the methods that we adopt to compare the models with the data .",
    "we shall focus on the simplest case of inflation driven by the canonical scalar field , say , @xmath12 . in a spatially flat friedmann universe , given a potential @xmath13 ,",
    "the scalar field satisfies the differential equation @xmath14 where the overdot represents differentiation with respect to the cosmic time , @xmath15 is the hubble parameter , with @xmath16 being the scale factor , while @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is usually characterized by a hierarchy of the so - called slow roll parameters .",
    "the first slow roll parameter is set to be @xmath18 , and the higher order slow roll parameters are defined in terms of the first as follows : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the number of e - folds .",
    "the scalar perturbations induced by the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton can be described by the curvature perturbation , say , @xmath22 , whose fourier modes satisfy the following differential equation : @xmath23 where the overprime denotes differentiation with respect to the conformal time coordinate , and @xmath24 . upon solving this differential equation with suitable initial conditions for modes of cosmological interest ,",
    "one arrives at the scalar power spectrum ( see section  [ sec : nm ] for the necessary details ) , defined as @xmath25 with @xmath26 being evaluated at sufficiently late times .",
    "smooth potentials , in general , permit slowly rolling fields ( i.e. wherein the parameters @xmath27 are much smaller than unity ) , and such backgrounds generate nearly scale invariant power spectra . for instance , the archetypical quadratic potential , viz .",
    "@xmath28 , leads to the required cobe amplitude ( for a suitable value of @xmath29 ) and an almost scale invariant spectrum with a scalar spectral index of @xmath30 , in strong conformity with the recent cmb data  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to smooth potentials , potentials that contain either non - trivial forms or sharp changes in their slopes lead to deviations from slow roll .",
    "departures from slow roll affect the amplitude of the modes that leave the hubble radius during this period resulting in specific features in the inflationary scalar power spectrum , with the shape being determined by the type of deviation from slow roll ( in this context , see , for instance , ref .",
    "interestingly , certain features in the scalar power spectrum are known to allow an improved fit to the cmb data than the conventional nearly scale invariant spectrum , as is generated by slow roll inflation  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider two types of inflationary models that have been shown to fit the data better than the power law primordial spectrum .",
    "the first type of model that we shall consider contains a step , which is typically introduced in the conventional quadratic potential at a certain location , say , @xmath31 , as follows  @xcite : @xmath32 .",

    "the field experiences a short period of fast roll as it crosses @xmath35 , leading to a brief burst of oscillations in the scalar power spectrum .",
    "a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling of the parameter space of the above potential points to the fact that the presence of the step aids in fitting the outliers in the wmap data near the multipoles of @xmath36 and @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , at the expense of the three additional parameters , viz .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the model results in an improvement in the effective least squares parameter @xmath37 by about @xmath38 , when compared with the quadratic potential without the step . in figure",

    "[ 0][1][1.5]@xmath39 [ 0][1][1.5]@xmath40 [ 0][1][1.5]@xmath41    over the last few years , two types of oscillatory inflationary potentials have drawn a considerable amount attention  @xcite .",
    "the first of these consists of the above - mentioned quadratic potential that is modulated by sinusoidal oscillations as follows : @xmath42.\\label{eq : qpsin}\\ ] ] the second is the so - called axion monodromy model that has its motivations in string theory , and is described by the potential @xmath43.\\label{eq : amm}\\ ] ] in both these cases , the slow roll parameters oscillate and , in fact , continue to exhibit such a behavior until the termination of inflation ( cf . figure  [ fig : slow - roll - parameters ] ) .",
    "all modes of interest are affected by these oscillations , which leave a repeated pattern that extends over all scales in the power spectrum .",
    "we shall illustrate the power spectra resulting in these models later in section  [ sec : results ] ( see figure  [ fig : sps - all ] ) , wherein we shall present the results of our analysis .",
    "we would like to mention here that recent analysis indicate that such power spectra lead to an improved fit to the wmap as well as the small scale act data . in the case of the quadratic potential modulated by sinusoidal oscillations",
    ", one finds that the least squares parameter @xmath37 reduces by about unity , whereas the monodromy model is found to lead to a much better fit to the data with an improvement in @xmath37 of up to @xmath0 , when compared with a more conventional , nearly scale invariant spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we shall compare the models with the cmb as well as the large scale structure data .",
    "we have worked with the wmap-@xmath10 data  @xcite and the halo power spectrum data arrived at from the lrg in sdss dr7  @xcite .",
    "we have made use of the large scale structure data to ensure that the parameter values we eventually work with to obtain the formation rate of the halos are consistent with the observed matter power spectrum .",
    "we have made use of the publicly available codes , viz .",
    "the cosmological boltzmann code camb  @xcite and the monte carlo code cosmomc  @xcite , to compute the cmb angular and the matter power spectra , and compare them with the data , respectively .",
    "as we had mentioned , we shall assume the background model to be the spatially flat @xmath6cdm and we shall work with the priors on the background parameters as listed in table  [ tab : priors - bp ] .",

    ". we should mention that we keep the same priors on the background parameters for all the cosmomc analysis in this paper . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ fig : likelihoods ] , we have illustrated the one dimensional likelihood on the parameter @xmath31 in the case of the quadratic potential with a step , and it is clear that the location of the step is highly constrained by data . the step affects the number density of halos over only highly localized mass scales .",
    "we have also plotted the marginalized two dimensional constraints on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath49 for the cases of the two oscillatory potentials .",
    "it is noteworthy that the constraints are strikingly similar .",
    "in fact , the roughly triangular shape of the contours can also be understood .",
    "as the parameter @xmath49 decreases , the resulting oscillations in the potential and , therefore , in the inflationary perturbation spectrum turn too frequent , and the data constrains the amplitude @xmath33 to a smaller region .

    ", we have only presented the results in the case of the models with oscillatory terms in the potential .    in order to arrive at the maximum possible change in the number density of halos when compared to the conventional nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum , for the models with oscillations in the potential , we have chosen values for the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath49 that they lie within ( actually , _ at _ ) @xmath4-@xmath5 from the best fit values .",
    "we have chosen the parameters in such a way that they create the largest deviation from the nearly scale invariant power spectra that are allowed by the cmb and observations of the large scale structure . in figure",

    "we have fixed the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath66 at their best fit values as shown in the table  [ tab : bestfit ] , since these parameters do not play a role in altering the features in the spectrum .",

    "however , we find that , for the case of the quadratic potential with sinusoidal modulation , the numbers can change by as much as @xmath1 for values of the potential parameters @xmath33 and @xmath49 that lie within @xmath4-@xmath5 .",
    "it should also be highlighted that the monodromy model does not seem to lead to the same extent of change in the number density and the rate of formation of halos , despite the fact that it produces fine oscillations in the primordial as well as the linear matter power spectra ( cf .",
    "figures  [ fig : sps - all ] and  [ fig : mps - all ] ) .",
    "actually , while the _ unbinned _ number density does indicate a @xmath71@xmath72 change , we find that , the change proves to be smaller when we bin the numbers in logarithmic mass bins , i.e. @xmath73 , of @xmath74 . evidently , binning seems to average out the rapid oscillations , resulting in a smaller extent of change in the numbers .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the effects of primordial features on the matter power spectrum as well as the number of halos formed and their rate of formation .",
    "similar work in this context  @xcite had suggested that a small change in the parameters describing the inflaton potential would lead to a drastic change in the number of halos formed . the earlier work was based on the inflationary perturbation spectrum that was arrived at based on the slow roll approximation . in contrast , we have carried a complete and accurate numerical analysis .",
    "further , we have made use of the sheth - tormen mass function ( instead of the older press - schechter one ) which is known to fit the data from the @xmath21-body simulations better .",
    "we have included the baryon acoustic oscillations in our analysis to have a more realistic comparison",
    ". moreover , to arrive at the parameter space of interest , all the potentials considered in our work have been constrained by an mcmc analysis ( using cosmomc ) against the wmap-7 and sdss lrg dr7 datasets .",
    "we find that , the best fit values for the potential parameters ( with the background parameters kept fixed ) lead to hardly any change in the number of halos formed when compared to the conventional quadratic potential that generates a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum .",
    "however , partly consistent with the earlier result , we find that values for the potential parameters that lie within @xmath4-@xmath5 of the best fit values indeed lead to a reasonable change in the number of halos formed and in their formation rates .",
    "for instance , we find that , with superimposed sinusoidal modulations , the quadratic potential leads to as much as a @xmath0@xmath1 change in the halo number density and the rate of formation .",
    "needless to mention , the step of comparing the models against the data is crucial as this imposes real bounds on the extent of changes in the numbers involved .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the inclusion of sdss data reduces the maximum change in number density to about @xmath75 , when compared to the case wherein one works with the parameters constrained by the wmap data alone .",
    "we would like to close this paper with the following remarks . as we had pointed out before , while comparing with the sdss data , we have not taken into account the non - linear effects on the matter power spectrum .",
    "it is for this reason that the theoretical curve had not fit the observational data well on small scales ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : mps - all ] ) .",
    "clearly , a more complete analysis should involve modeling of the non - linear effects and their inclusion in evaluating the matter power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it will be interesting to compare the results on the number of halos formed in numerical simulations , evolved from primordial spectra with features , with the small scale data .",

    "<S> features in the primordial scalar power spectrum provide a possible roadway to describe the outliers at the low multipoles in the wmap data . apart from the cmb angular power spectrum , these features </S>",
    "<S> can also alter the matter power spectrum and , thereby , the formation of the large scale structure . carrying out a complete numerical analysis , we investigate the effects of primordial features on the formation rates of the halos . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a few different inflationary models that lead to features in the scalar power spectrum and an improved fit to the cmb data , and analyze the corresponding imprints on the formation of halos . performing a markov chain monte carlo analysis with the wmap seven year data and the sdss halo power spectrum from lrg dr7 for the models of our interest , we arrive at the parameter space of the models allowed by the data . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that , inflationary potentials , such as the quadratic potential with sinusoidal modulations and the axion monodromy model , which generate certain repeated , oscillatory features in the inflationary perturbation spectrum , do not induce a substantial difference in the number density of halos at their best fit values , when compared with , say , a nearly scale invariant spectrum as is generated by the standard quadratic potential . however , we find that the number density and the formation rates of halos change by about @xmath0@xmath1 for halo masses ranging over @xmath2@xmath3 , for potential parameters that lie within @xmath4-@xmath5 around the best fit values arrived at from the aforesaid joint constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the implications of our results . </S>"
