    "whether the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter , governed by quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , has a critical point in the temperature ( @xmath2 ) and baryon chemical potential @xmath3 plane , is an exciting question that has attracted many theorists , phenomenologists , and heavy ion experimentalists . a variety of models , which have been successfully tested for hadronic properties in our world , such as an effective chiral nambu - jana lasinio type model , lead to a phase diagram @xcite with a critical point in a world with two light quarks and one heavier quark .",
    "it is clearly desirable to obtain it from qcd directly , or show a lack of its existence , especially since enormous efforts at rhic and other accelerators are being devoted to look for it .",
    "one usually has to deal with large coupling constants in the world of ( low energy ) hadronic interactions .",
    "non - perturbative lattice qcd , defined on a discrete space - time lattice , has proved itself to be the most reliable technique for extracting such information from qcd .",
    "the hadron spectrum has been computed successfully and predictions of weak decay constants of heavy mesons have been made . since these fix quark masses and @xmath4 , a completely parameter free application of this approach to finite temperature qcd has yielded a slew of thermodynamics determinations , such as the pressure as a function of temperature .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether lattice qcd can help us in locating the qcd critical point .    due to the well - known fermion doubling problem",
    ", one has to make a compromise in choosing the quark type for any computation .",
    "we employ the staggered quarks .",
    "these have an exact chiral symmetry which provides an order parameter for the entire @xmath2-@xmath3 plane but unfortunately flavour and spin symmetry are broken for them on lattice . the existence of the critical point , on the other hand",
    ", is expected to depend crucially on the number of flavours . although computationally much more expensive , domain wall or overlap fermions are better in this regard , as they do have the correct symmetries for any lattice spacing at zero temperature and density .",
    "introduction of chemical potential , @xmath5 , for these , however , is not straight - forward due to their non - locality .",
    "bloch and wettig @xcite proposed a way to do this .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out @xcite that their prescription breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "recently , this problem has been solved @xcite and a lattice action with nonzero @xmath5 and the same chiral symmetries as continuum qcd has been proposed .",
    "it will be interesting to compare its results with those for the staggered quarks .",
    "finite density simulations needed for locating a critical point suffer from another well known problem .",
    "this one is inherited from the continuum theory itself : the fermion sign problem .",
    "assuming @xmath6 flavours of quarks , and denoting by @xmath7 the corresponding chemical potentials , the qcd partition function is    @xmath8    where quarks have been integrated leading to the determinant .",
    "the thermal expectation value of an observable @xmath9 is @xmath10    numerical simulations or analytical computations can be done if det  @xmath11 for any set of @xmath12 .",
    "however , det  @xmath13 is a complex number for any @xmath14 .",
    "this famous phase / sign problem is a major stumbling block in extending the lattice techniques to the entire @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "several approaches have been proposed in the past decade to deal with it .",
    "let me provide a partial list : 1 ) two parameter re - weighting @xcite , 2 ) imaginary chemical potential @xcite , 3 ) taylor expansion @xcite , 4 ) canonical ensemble method @xcite , and 5 ) complex langevin approach @xcite .",
    "we employ the taylor expansion approach @xcite to obtain the results discussed in the next section .",
    "our earlier results were obtained by simulating full qcd with two flavours of staggered fermions of mass @xmath15 on @xmath16 lattices , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 24 @xcite and a finer @xmath19 with @xmath18 12 , 18 , 24 @xcite . from the work of the milc collaboration @xcite , we know that our lattices correspond to @xmath20 , leading to a goldstone pion of 230 mev . in order to approach the continuum limit of @xmath21",
    ", we proceeded to work on an even finer lattice @xmath22 , keeping @xmath15 fixed .",
    "as before , the peak of the polyakov loop susceptibility was used to define the critical coupling @xmath23 and plaquette determinations on symmetric lattices were used to tune the temperature such that simulation range covered @xmath24 .",
    "our determination of @xmath23 is in excellent agreement with that of gottlieb et al .",
    "typically 100 - 200 independent configurations , separated by many autocorrelation lengths were used to make measurements of physical quantities .    from canonical definitions of number densities @xmath25 and susceptibilities @xmath26 ,",
    "the qcd pressure @xmath27 can be seen to have the following expansion in @xmath5 : @xmath28 where the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the number of derivatives of the partition function with respect to the corresponding chemical potentials .",
    "we set @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the expressions and construct a series for baryonic susceptibility from this expansion @xcite .",
    "its radius of convergence is what we look for .",
    "successive estimates for the radius of convergence were obtained by using the ratio method [ @xmath33 ] and the n@xmath34 root method [ @xmath35 .",
    "we used terms up to 8th order in @xmath5 for doing so . a key point to note is that all coefficients of the series must be positive for the critical point to be at real @xmath5 , and thus physical .",
    "we thus first look for this condition to be satisfied and then look for agreement between the two definitions above as well as their @xmath36-independence to locate the critical point .",
    "the detailed expressions for all the terms can be found in @xcite where the method to evaluate them is also explained .",
    "we use stochastic estimators . for terms up to the 8@xmath34 order one",
    "needs 20 inversions of @xmath13 on @xmath371000 vectors for a single measurement on a given gauge configuration .",
    "work is in progress to double these .",
    "our earlier determination of the critical point on @xmath38 resulted from the constancy for both the ratios defined above at @xmath39 , with all the susceptibilities being positive , leading @xcite to the coordinates of the endpoint ( e ) the critical point  to be @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for that lattice .",
