    "an important aid in the understanding of wave propagation in inhomogeneous media is seismic forward modeling . in all but the simplest cases , an analytical solution of the elastodynamic equations",
    "is not available , and one must resort to numerical solutions . for this , two main strategies can be followed : one solves the elastodynamic equations either in the strong formulation , where the equations of motion and boundary conditions are written in differential form , or in the weak formulation , where the equations of motion are given in integral form . the latter formulation , implemented by finite element @xcite , spectral element @xcite or finite integral methods @xcite , may be preferred to deal with complex geometries , or non - trivial free surface boundary conditions .",
    "the first strategy ( the strong formulation ) is followed in the finite - difference approach that is based on solving either the first - order velocity - stress differential equations @xcite , or the second order wave equation @xcite . in the original formulation of the velocity - stress finite - difference time - domain ( vs - fdtd )",
    "approach @xcite , space and time are both discretized using second - order finite differences .",
    "many enhancements have been introduced to increase the accuracy and treatment of special boundary conditions .",
    "for example , spectral methods have been employed to increase the accuracy of the approximation of the spatial derivative operators @xcite ; a rotated staggered spatial grid has been developed to surmount some instability and lack of spatial accuracy issues @xcite ; polynomial expansions of the time evolution operator have been used to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the time integration process @xcite .",
    "although each specific method cited above offers its own advantages and drawbacks , none of these methods feature unconditional stability and/or exact energy conservation , which can be useful for long integration times , and high material contrast situations , where instabilities have been noticed @xcite . the algorithms that will be introduced in this paper ,",
    "address this issue .",
    "starting from the velocity - stress first - order differential equations , it can be shown ( see section [ sec : theory ] ) that the solution of these equations can be written as the matrix exponential of a skew - symmetric matrix .",
    "this constitutes an orthogonal transformation , conserving the total energy density .",
    "guided by recent results regarding the numerical solution of the time - dependent maxwell equations @xcite , where the underlying skew - symmetry of the equations of motion is exploited in a matrix exponential approach , we apply this framework to the current problem . in section [ sec : matrixexp ] this framework is briefly repeated for convenience and three algorithms are derived to solve the time - dependent elastodynamic equations .",
    "the incorporation of the presence of a source is described in section [ sec : source ] .",
    "for some typical examples , the performance and efficiency of the algorithms is studied in section [ sec : results ] , and the conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the absence of body forces , the linearized equation of momentum conservation reads @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the density , @xmath2 is the displacement field and @xmath3 the stress field ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "it can be recast into a coupled first order velocity - stress equation @xcite , yielding in matrix form @xmath5 here , @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the velocity field and @xmath8 is the matrix containing the spatial derivatives operators , @xmath9 the stiffness tensor @xmath10 relates the stress and strain , @xmath11 and is symmetric and positive definite for elastic solids .    some important symmetries in matrix equation ( [ mtx_nonsym ] ) can be made explicit by introducing the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 the expression @xmath14 is valid since @xmath15 is symmetric and positive definite . by definition , the length of @xmath16 , given by @xmath17 is related to the elastic energy density @xmath18 of the fields .    in terms of @xmath19 , matrix equation ( [ mtx_nonsym ] )",
    "becomes @xmath20 using the symmetric properties of @xmath1 and @xmath14 , one can prove that the matrix @xmath21 is skew - symmetric @xmath22 with respect to the inner product as defined in equation ( [ normpsi ] ) .",
    "the formal solution of equation ( [ mtx_sym ] ) is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the initial state of the fields and the operator @xmath25 determines their time evolution . and",
    ", since @xmath21 is skew - symmetric the time evolution operator , @xmath25 is an orthogonal transformation : @xmath26 and it follows that @xmath27 hence , the time evolution operator @xmath28 rotates the vector @xmath29 without changing its length @xmath30 . in physical terms",
    ", this means that the total energy density of the fields does not change with time , as can be expected on physical grounds  @xcite .    in practice , the construction of a numerical algorithm requires to discretize space and time . during both these procedures , the skew - symmetry of @xmath21 ( during the spatial discretization ) and the orthogonality of @xmath25 ( during the time integration ) should be conserved . for the discretization of space",
    ", this requirement can be met by choosing a staggered spatial grid @xcite and a central difference approximation for the spatial derivative .",
    "this yields a skew - symmetric matrix @xmath31 for the discrete analogue of @xmath21 .",
    "a unit cell of the grid is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .     and @xmath32",
    "coincide with the stress field components , and the mass density is only defined on velocity field points .",
    "right : grid for the general anisotropic case ( @xmath33 ) . ]",
    "the explicit form of @xmath31 is derived in the appendix , in the case of a two - dimensional isotropic elastic solid .",
    "accordingly , the discrete analogue of @xmath29 is given by vector @xmath34 .",
    "the continuous problem , defined by @xmath21 , is now translated to a lattice problem defined by @xmath31 : @xmath35 or , in the time - stepping approach , we have for a small timestep @xmath36 @xmath37 at this point , we invoke three different strategies to perform the time integration , i.e. to approximate the matrix exponential @xmath38 . here",
    ", we closely follow the derivation of algorithms to solve the time - dependent maxwell equations @xcite , where the problem to be solved is stated in a very similar form , although the underlying physics is different .",
    "the first algorithm is based on conserving the existing symmetries during the discretization of time , and is unconditionally stable . here",
    ", the time integration is carried out by a time - stepping procedure .",
    "the second algorithm is based on approximating the solution itself for a particular time instance , by means of a chebyshev expansion , and constitutes therefore a `` one - step '' algorithm .",
    "the last algorithm is based on recasting the original velocity - stress finite - difference algorithm into matrix exponential form .",
    "this allows to remove the staggered - in - time nature , and offers an elegant way to derive higher - order in time algorithms .",
    "the construction of the algorithms is briefly repeated in the next section .",
    "a sufficient condition for an algorithm to be unconditionally stable is that  @xcite @xmath39 since @xmath40 is an orthogonal transformation ( see previous section ) , we have @xmath41 , and it is sufficient to conserve the orthogonality of @xmath42 for an approximation @xmath43 to @xmath42 , in order to construct an unconditionally stable algorithm .",
    "one way to accomplish this is to make use of the lie - trotter - suzuki formula  @xcite and generalizations thereof  @xcite . if the matrix @xmath31 is decomposed , so that @xmath44 , then @xmath45 is a first order approximation to @xmath40 .",
    "more importantly , if each matrix @xmath46 is skew - symmetric , then @xmath47 is orthogonal by construction , and hence , algorithms based on @xmath47 , are unconditionally stable .",
    "using the fact that both @xmath40 and @xmath47 are orthogonal matrices , the error on @xmath47 is subject to the upper bound  @xcite @xmath48\\|\\ , , \\label{tserror}\\ ] ] where @xmath49=h_i h_j - h_j h_i$ ] .    in the appendix ,",
    "the decomposition of @xmath31 is carried out for two - dimensional isotropic elastic solids , for which @xmath50 , and it is shown that each matrix @xmath46 is block diagonal .",
    "the computation of the matrix exponential of a block diagonal matrix @xmath46 can be performed efficiently , as it is equal to the block - diagonal matrix of the matrix exponentials of the individual blocks .",
    "therefore , the numerical calculation of @xmath51 reduces to the calculation of matrix exponentials of @xmath52 matrices , which are rotations .    in practice ,",
    "implementation of the first order algorithm is all that is required to construct higher order algorithms .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the product - formula approach , the accuracy of an approximation can be improved in a systematic way by reusing lower order approximations , without changing the fundamental symmetries .",
    "for example , the orthogonal matrix @xmath53 is a second - order approximation to @xmath40  @xcite . a particularly useful fourth - order approximation ( applied in for example  @xcite ) is given by  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "a well - known alternative for timestepping is to use chebyshev polynomials to construct approximations to time - evolution operators @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been successfully applied to the problem of seismic wave propagation @xcite .",
    "however , the main differences between these implementations and the algorithm explained below , besides the spatial discretization ( which is based here on a central difference approximation , instead of a spectral method ) , is that in the present case , matrix @xmath31 is explicitly anti - symmetrized , which gives rise to purely imaginary eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this is an important property to justify the validity of the expansion . in the derivation of the current algorithm",
    ", we follow @xcite , a recent implementation of the chebyshev algorithm to solve electromagnetic wave propagation .",
    "the basic idea is to expand the time evolution matrix @xmath56 for a specific time instance @xmath57 in matrix valued chebyshev polynomials on the domain of eigenvalues of @xmath31 , which lies entirely on the imaginary axis since @xmath31 is skew - symmetric . for proper application of the expansion ,",
    "the domain of eigenvalues is rescaled to @xmath58 $ ] , by considering the matrix @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the 1-norm of the matrix .",
    "it is given by @xmath61 , see @xcite , and is easy to compute since the matrix @xmath31 is sparse .",
    "operating on state @xmath62 , the expansion becomes @xmath63\\psi(0),\\label{eqn : cheb_sum}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the identity matrix , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are @xmath67th order bessel functions and @xmath68 are the modified chebyshev polynomials , defined by the recursion relation    [ cheb_recur2 ] @xmath69    due to the fact that the matrix @xmath70 is purely imaginary , it follows from the above recursion relation ( [ cheb_recur2 ] ) that @xmath71 and thus @xmath34 will be real valued and no complex arithmetic is involved , as should be the case .    in practice ,",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cheb_sum ] ) will be truncated at some expansion index @xmath72 .",
    "this number depends on the value of @xmath73 , since the amplitude of the coefficients @xmath74 decrease exponentially for @xmath75 ; this is explained in more detail in refs .",
    "consequently , the computation of one timestep amounts to carrying out @xmath72 repetitions of recursion relation eq .",
    "( [ cheb_recur2 ] ) to obtain the final state .",
    "this is a simple procedure : only the multiplication of a vector with a sparse matrix and the summation of vectors are involved .      in section [ sec : uncond ]",
    ", it was shown that in the product formula formalism , higher - order in time algorithms can be constructed by reusing the lower order algorithms .",
    "this elegant technique to increase the accuracy of time integration can also be applied to fdtd algorithms ( in case of the maxwell equations , see @xcite ) , and hence the conventional vs - fdtd algorithm , if it is recast into an exponent operator form .",
    "the update equations of the vs - fdtd @xcite algorithm can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 since @xmath79 , the time evolution operator @xmath47 is equal to @xmath80 and second - order accurate in time operating on fields that are defined staggered - in - time . however , if @xmath47 is interpreted as an approximation to the operator @xmath81 , working on fields non staggered - in - time , it is a first - order approximation .",
    "furthermore , since the time evolution operator is now expressed in matrix exponential form , the accuracy can be increased by the same procedure as was used for the unconditionally stable algorithms ( cf .",
    "( [ secordapp ] ) and ( [ fouordapp ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath82 constitutes a second - order approximation to the exact time evolution operator . and",
    "similarly , a fourth order algorithm can be derived , see eq .",
    "( [ fouordapp ] ) .",
    "so , by introducing a small modification to the original vs - fdtd algorithm , that would require a minimal change in existing numerical codes , the staggered - in - time nature is removed , and higher - order in time algorithms are derived .",
    "in the presence of an explosive initial condition , or other time - dependent body force , the equation of motion reads @xmath83 where the time - dependent source is denoted by the term @xmath84 .",
    "the formal solution is given by @xmath85 in the time - stepping approach ( e.g. the unconditionally stable algorithms ) , the source term if its time dependence is known explicitly can be integrated for each timestep .",
    "for example , a standard quadrature formula can be employed to compute the integral over @xmath86 , like the fourth - order accurate simpson rule @xcite @xmath87    in case of the one - step algorithm , this approach of incorporating the source term is not efficient , as for each value of @xmath88 the recursion ( [ cheb_recur2 ] ) would have to be performed , and a different route is taken . instead , each of the two terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ sol_source ] ) is expanded in modified chebyshev polynomials separately .",
    "the expansion of the first term is discussed in section [ sec : cheby ] . for the second term , the source - term integral , the procedure is carried out here for a source with gaussian time dependence , @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the spatial dependence of the source .",
    "the source term @xmath91 is expanded in modified chebyshev polynomials , @xmath92 where the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath93 the replacement of @xmath31 by @xmath94 emphasizes that @xmath31 should be normalized such that all eigenvalues lie in the range @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "we proceed by evaluating @xmath95 .",
    "after substitution of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 normalize the matrix @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath100.\\ ] ] now we put @xmath101 and the remaining integral over @xmath102 in equation ( [ cheb_coeff_source ] ) is computed by a fast fourier transformation : @xmath103    the derivation of the chebyshev expansion coefficients for a source defined by equation @xmath104 is very similar , and will not be treated explicitly here .",
    "the performance and accuracy of the algorithms introduced in the previous sections is studied by comparing the results with a reference solution generated by the one - step algorithm , denoted by @xmath105 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the latter , considering the time integration , produces numerically exact results @xcite . furthermore , there are rigorous bounds on the error of the unconditionally stable algorithm ( cf .",
    "( [ tserror ] ) ) : in the presence of a source @xmath84 , the difference between the exact solution @xmath34 and the approximate solution @xmath106 , obtained by using the 4th order unconditionally stable algorithm , is bounded by @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a constant . for the difference between the exact solution and the solution obtained by using the one - step algorithm",
    ", we can write using the triangle inequality @xmath109 using equations ( [ ut4bound ] ) and ( [ triang ] ) and the fact that the difference @xmath110 vanishes with @xmath111 , as we will show below , we can be confident that the one - step algorithm indeed produces numerically exact results .",
    "this justifies to define the error as @xmath112 .",
