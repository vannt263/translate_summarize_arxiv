    "the question whether or not the neutrino is a majorana particle and , if so , what is its average mass remains one the of the most fundamental problems in physics today . in a previous series of papers we have calculated phase - space factors ( psf ) and nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) for @xmath8 , @xmath9 processes @xcite , and for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "processes @xcite .",
    "the neutrinoless electron capture @xmath0 was not calculated due to the fact that , in general , one can not conserve energy and momentum in the process @xmath15 however , conservation of energy and momentum can occur in the special case in which the energy of the initial state matches precisely the energy of the final state .",
    "this situation was first discussed by winter @xcite and subsequently elaborated by bernabeu _",

    "the work of @xcite stimulated many experimental searches and additional theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "the process was also termed resonant neutrinoless double electron capture , @xmath16 .",
    "the matching condition can occur either for g.s . to g.s .",
    "transitions or for transitions between the g.s . and an excited state in the final nucleus .",
    "the precise matching condition is an exceptional circumstance which may or may not occur in practice .",

    "<S> direct determination of the neutrino mass is at the present time one of the most important aims of experimental and theoretical research in nuclear and particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> a possible way of detection is through neutrinoless double electron capture , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this process can only occur when the energy of the initial state matches precisely that of the final state . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a calculation of prefactors ( pf ) and nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) within the framework of the microscopic interacting boson model ( ibm-2 ) for @xmath1xe , @xmath2gd , @xmath3dy , @xmath4er , and @xmath5w . from pf and nme we calculate the expected half - lives and obtain results that are of the same order as those of @xmath6 decay , but considerably longer than those of @xmath7 decay . </S>"
