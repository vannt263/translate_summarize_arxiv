    "physics at the planck scale is considered to be the holy grail in present fundamental research . up to now",
    "it has not been rigorously shown which physical phenomena occur at the planck scale and how they can be described within a mathematical formalism .",
    "for this reason it makes sense to construct simple models in order to mimic effects expected to occur at this scale . the property `` simple ''",
    "means using underlying concepts of established theories such as general relativity and quantum theory , which are well understood and hold for energies much smaller than the planck energy .",
    "one fundamental concept are einstein s field equations in general relativity linking energy density to spacetime geometry .",
    "another one is heisenberg s uncertainty principle in quantum theory saying that two complementary particle properties are always endowed with uncertainties . assuming that both still hold at the planck scale",
    ", energy uncertainty will result in an uncertainty of spacetime geometry or even topology .",
    "thus , under this assumption , spacetime metric coefficients and spacetime curvature will begin to fluctuate at the planck energy .",
    "such fluctuations are often referred to as spacetime foam or spacetime defects @xcite .    there exist various models for spacetime defects with nontrivial topology .",
    "one way in which to obtain a spacetime defect is to cut an open set out of minkowski space and to impose certain conditions on the remaining boundary .",
    "this then leads to a spacetime @xmath0 having a different topology .",
    "for example , cutting out an open ball of @xmath1 and identifying antipodal points on the boundary results in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the three - dimensional orientable real projective space @xcite .",
    "however , the interest not only lies in the defects themselves , but in their influence upon the propagation properties of particles , for example photons . in @xcite , the modification of the photon dispersion law",
    "is investigated for certain classes of defects .",
    "the method used is to consider the scattering of an electromagnetic wave at one single defect .",
    "certain conditions for the physical fields are then set on the boundary of the defect and maxwell s equations are solved by introducing a correction field . even for a single defect this is a difficult task and the approach would be more difficult for two defects and impractical for a large number of defects nearby .",
    "since we are interested in the propagation of photons through a spacetime foam made up of many defects , we proceed with an alternative possibility that was initiated in @xcite . here",
    "the _ cpt_-anomaly is derived for a non - abelian gauge group _ so_(10 ) on two spacetime manifolds with nontrivial topology : a spacetime with a linear defect @xmath4 and a spacetime with two identical open balls removed from @xmath1 and points on their boundary properly identified ( wormhole ) .",
    "it is shown that the _ cpt_-anomaly occurs for the abelian subgroup @xmath5 , as well .",
    "the anomaly gives a contribution to the effective action as an @xmath6-term with the field strength tensor @xmath7 and its dual @xmath8 .",
    "since it is tremendously difficult to obtain the anomaly for several defects , the introduction of a background field is mandatory .",
    "this field does not describe any microscopic defect properties and , hence , serves as an effective approach for the case when the photon wave length is much larger than the defect size .",
    "we will follow this idea and describe a single defect as pointlike , where it is assumed to be time - dependent  contrary to ref .",
    "such defects are distributed randomly in minkowski space resulting in an effective `` random '' background field .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of defects is taken as being lorentz - invariant .",
    "we study whether and how the dispersion relation of photons is affected by such a time - dependent and lorentz - invariant background .",

    "we intend to distribute spacetime defects in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath0 in a lorentz - invariant manner . this will be possible if defects are distributed according to a `` poisson process '' ( i.e. a sprinkling ) .",
    "the result of the poisson process is a poisson distribution of defects throughout the spacetime .",
    "this means that the probability of observing @xmath41 defects in a rectangular spacetime region with side length @xmath42 and volume @xmath43 is given by : @xmath44 herein , @xmath45 is at first a parameter that characterizes the distribution .",
    "note that eq .   is a valid description for a probability distribution , which is both isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "the most natural choice for a distribution of pointlike  i.e. zero - dimensional  spacetime defects is an isotropic one if we do not take into account any mechanism producing defects that make space anisotropic ( for example , defects similar to cosmic strings @xcite ) .",
    "when the volume of the region approaches zero ( @xmath46 with an infinitesimal value @xmath47 ) , the probability of finding a single defect in that region is proportional to the volume @xmath48 on the other hand , the probability of finding more than one defect is negligible : @xmath49 an explicit realization of the poisson process is then described by the following steps @xcite :    * divide @xmath50 into small boxes with volume @xmath51 . * then place a defect into each box with probability @xmath52 . *",
    "the poisson process is obtained in the limit @xmath53 .    the poisson process or `` sprinkling '' is invariant under any volume - preserving linear transformation and in particular it is invariant under lorentz transformations ( this happens because the process only depends on the spacetime volume @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite that the realizations of the poisson process are lorentz - invariant individually as well .",
    "lorentz invariance in this context has the following meaning    `` _ _ the discrete set of sprinkled points must not , in and of itself , serve to pick out a preferred reference frame . _ _ ''",
    "@xcite    that is , the statistical properties of the distribution of defects ( e.g. the mean density of defects ) do not depend on which reference frame we choose to measure them in ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : defect - sprinkling ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the number of defects contained in different regions of equal volume @xmath51 is not constant but fluctuates from region to region @xmath54 where the mean number of defects and the standard deviation are respectively @xmath55 these results can be explicitly obtained by using eq .  .",
    "therefore we can identify the parameter @xmath45 with the mean density of defects : @xmath56 .",
    "moreover fluctuations in the number of defects also imply fluctuations in the density @xmath57 from a region to another @xmath58 nevertheless , these fluctuations become negligible when the mean volume occupied by the defects , namely @xmath59 , is much smaller than the volume @xmath51 of the region considered @xmath60 thus we can regard the density as being constant so long as we consider scales that are much larger than the mean separation between defects : @xmath61 when @xmath62 . being able to perform computations with",
    "a globally constant volume means that the distribution is homogeneous as well .",
    "otherwise the density @xmath45 would only be defined locally .",

    "we intend to derive a set of functions that will be extensively needed for the solution of the scalar and photon field equations .",
    "first of all , we investigate the problem of photon propagation through a spacetime with @xmath63 defects in the finite subset with volume @xmath50 given by eq .  .",
    "the corresponding functions and fields are denoted with indices ` @xmath63 ' or ` @xmath42 ' .",
    "we now consider the `` free '' field equation for @xmath23 , i.e. neglecting the coupling to the photon but not to the defects . in order to solve the field equation ,",
    "the truncated fourier transform of @xmath15 when restricted to the box is necessary @xmath64 analogously we define the inverse fourier transform by @xmath65 in configuration space the coordinates are restricted by the side length of the box considered .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum value in momentum space , which is manifest in the integration limits . in principle , for a finite volume the fourier transform would correspond to a fourier series with discrete coordinates or momenta .",
    "however for simplicity we will assume a continuous spectrum .",
    "this does not play any role as we will eventually generalize the results to the whole of minkowski spacetime anyway .",
    "we use eq .   as an _ ansatz _ to obtain the following solution of the field equation of @xmath15 in momentum space    @xmath66    @xmath67    the solution depends on the bare mass of the scalar field and the distribution of spacetime defects .",
    "furthermore it consists of two contributions .",
    "the first , @xmath68 , solely describes the defects and the second , @xmath69 , serves as a mediator between the defects and the photons . in principle eq .   can be regarded as being a solution of the classical field equations restricted to a finite box .",
    "later on we will need to consider the product of two such solutions evaluated at different momenta  especially for the perturbative photon field . the function @xmath70 then serves as an effective background that describes the influence of the spacetime defects on the photons .",
    "therefore we will refer to it as an effective background field in what follows .    since eq .",
    "gives the background field with respect to the number of defects , we define the corresponding background field with regard to the volume : @xmath71 we keep in mind that @xmath23 couples to the photon via the last term of eq .  .",
    "after establishing all intermediate results we compute the limits @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "in the subsequent paragraphs we are going to perform a statistical treatment of photon propagation through the background field . in light of this we will encounter products of functions defined by eqs .  , ( or eq .  ) , where each depends on a different four - momentum .",
    "such products will have to be summed over the total number @xmath63 of defects distributed in the whole of minkowski space .",
    "according to eq .",
    "the defect density does not change with respect to lorentz transformations .",
    "however this does not mean that the defect positions are lorentz - invariant .",
    "therefore , besides summing over the number of defects we are also going to integrate over all lorentz transformations from zero to an upper limit @xmath74 . we introduce this cutoff to avoid difficulties from integrating over the noncompact lorentz group .",
    "we are then ready to compute the sum of complex exponential functions ( random phases ) , each evaluated at the spacetime point of a defect .",

    "hence , for spacetime defects of the size @xmath82 with the planck length @xmath83 , where a classical approach is supposed to be valid , the defects would be separated by at least @xmath84 .",
    "even if their separation is larger by several orders of magnitude , the approximation of a dense distribution still makes sense .",
    "we assume that this conclusion can be applied to the spacetime foam model with pointlike defects investigated here .",
