    "the key motivation in research on drag reduction is to develop new technology that will result in the design of vehicles with a significantly lower fuel consumption .",
    "the field is broad , ranging from passive methods , such as coating surfaces with materials that are super - hydrophobic or non - smooth @xcite , to active methods , such as applying wall suction or using measurement - based closed - loop control @xcite .",
    "this work positions itself in the field of active control methods for skin - friction drag . in general , the mean skin friction of a turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate is an order of magnitude larger compared to a laminar boundary layer .",
    "one strategy to reduce skin - friction drag is thus to push the laminar - turbulent transition on a flat plate downstream @xcite .",
    "different transition scenarios may occur in a boundary layer flows , depending on the intensity of the external disturbances acting on the flow , @xcite . under low levels of free - stream turbulence and sufficiently far downstream ,",
    "the transition process is initiated by the linear growth of small perturbations called tollmien - schlichting ( ts ) waves @xcite .",
    "eventually , these perturbations reach finite amplitudes and breakdown to smaller scales via nonlinear mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , in presence of stronger free - stream disturbances , the exponential growth of ts waves are bypassed and transition may be directly triggered by the algebraic growth of stream - wise elongated structures , called streaks @xcite .",
    "one may delay transition by damping the growth of ts waves and/or streaks , and thus postpone their nonlinear breakdown .",
    "this strategy enables the use of linear theory for control design .",
    "fluid dynamists noticed in the early 90 s , that many of the emerging concepts in hydrodynamic stability theory already existed in linear systems theory @xcite .",
    "for example , the analysis of a system forced by harmonic excitations is referred to as signalling problem by fluid dynamicists , while control theorists analyze the problem by constructing a bode diagram , @xcite ; similarly , a large transient growth of a fluid system corresponds to large norm of a transfer function and matrix with stable eigenvalues can be called either globally stable or hurtwitz , @xcite .    however , the systems theoretical approach had taken one step further , by `` closing the loop '' , i.e  providing rigorous conditions and tools to modify the linear system at hand .",
    "it was realized by fluid dynamists that the extension of hydrodynamic stability theory to include tools and concepts from linear control theory was natural @xcite . a long series of numerical investigations addressing the various aspects of closed - loop control of transitional @xcite and turbulent flows @xcite followed in the wake of these initial contributions .    at the same time ,",
    "research on active control for transition delay has been advanced from a more practical approach using system identification methods @xcite and active wave - cancellation techniques @xcite .",
    "most work ( but not all ) is experimental , which due to feasibility constraints , has favoured an engineering and occasionally _ ad hoc _ methods .",
    "one of the first examples of this approach is the control of ts waves in the experiments by @xcite using a wave - cancellation control ; the propagating waves are cancelled by generating perturbations with opposite phase .",
    "this work was followed by number of successful experimental investigations @xcite of transition delay using more sophisticated system identification techniques .    whereas both numerical and experimental approaches have pushed forward flow control research ,",
    "they have in a large extent evolved disconnected from each other ; the systems control theoretical approach has provided very important insights into physical mechanisms and constraints that has to be addressed in order to design active control that is optimal and robust , but most work has stayed at a proof - of - concept level and have not yet been fully implemented in practical applications .",
    "although , there are exceptions @xcite , the majority of experimental active control has essentially suffered from the opposite ; most controllers are developed directly in the experimental setting on a trial - and - error basis , with many tuning parameters , that have to be chosen for each particular set - up .",
    "this review aims at presenting model - based and model - free techniques that are appropriate for the control of ts waves in a flat - plate boundary layer . we compare and link the two approaches using a linear model ,",
    "that similar to the linearized navier - stokes equations , exhibits a large transient amplification behaviour and time delays .",
    "this presentation is unavoidably influenced by the authors background and previous work ; complementary reviews on flow control can be found in @xcite , where the linear approach is analyzed , and in the reviews by @xcite , focussed on the identification of reduced - order models for the linear control design .",
    "finally , we refer to @xcite for a broader prospective .",
    "consider a steady uniform flow @xmath0 over a thin flat plate of length @xmath1 and infinite width .",
    "inside the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ( blasius ) boundary layer that develops over the plate , we place a small localized disturbance ( denoted by @xmath2 in  [ fig : bl - sketch ] ) of simple gaussian shape ; the set - up is the same as in @xcite and the simulation is performed using a spectral code @xcite .",
    "[ fig : xt - and - signals_dns-2dbl ] summarizes the spatio - temporal evolution of the disturbance .",
    "it shows a contour plot of the stream - wise component of the perturbation velocity at a wall normal position @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the displacement thickness of the boundary layer .",
    "the temporal growth of this disturbance is determined by classical linear stability theory ( i.e.  eigenvalue analysis of the linearized navier - stokes equations ) .",
    "such an analysis reveals that asymptotically a compact wave - packet emerges  a ts wave - packet  that grows in time at an exponential rate while travelling downstream at group velocity of approximately @xmath5 .",
    "this disturbance behaviour is observed as long as the amplitude is below a critical value ( usually a few percent of @xmath0 ) @xcite . above the critical value ,",
    "nonlinear effects have to be taken into account ; they eventually result in a break down of the disturbance to smaller scales and finally to transition from a laminar to a turbulent flow@xcite",
    ". however , the key point  that enables the use of linear theory for transition control  is that the disturbance may grow several orders of magnitude before it breaks down",
    ".     grows exponentially while convected downstream .",
    "the actuator @xmath6 is used to attenuate the disturbance before it triggers transition to turbulence ; the actuation signal is computed based on the measurements provided by the sensor @xmath7 .",

    "actuators_. an example of an actuator is a loudspeaker that generates short pulses through a small orifice in the plate .",
    "the volume of the loudspeaker and the shape of the orifice determines the type of actuation .",
    "another example is plasma actuators , where a plasma arch is used to induce a forcing on the flow @xcite .    in closed - loop control , a sensor ( denoted by @xmath7 in  [ fig : bl - sketch ] )",
    "is used to measure the disturbance that is meant to be cancelled by the actuator @xmath10 : based on these measurements one computes the actuator action in order to effectively reduce the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "examples of sensors include pressure measurements using a small microphone membrane mounted flush to the wall , velocity measurements using hot - wire anemometry near the wall or shear - stress measurements using thermal sensors ( wall wires ) . finally , we place a second sensor ( denoted by @xmath8 in  [ fig : bl - sketch ] ) downstream of the actuator to measure the amplitude of the perturbation after the actuator action",

    "the review finalizes with a discussion  [ sec : reduction ] about some important features characterizing the control problem when applied to three - dimensional ( 3d ) fluid flows and conclusions  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we first introduce our choice of model ks equation , inputs ( actuators / disturbances ) and sensors .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of concepts pertinent to our work , namely the state - space formulation (  [ sec : state - space ] ) , transfer functions and finite - impulse response (  [ sec : io ] ) , controllability and observability (  [ sec : gramians ] ) , closed - loop system (  [ sec : cloop ] ) and robustness (  [ sec : robustness ] ) .",
    "this chapter contains the mathematical ingredients that will be used in the following sections .      in this paper , we focus our attention on flows dominated by convection / advection , where disturbances have negligible upstream influence and are quickly swept downstream with the flow .",
    "we make use of a particular variant of the ks equation to model a linear and convection - dominated flow .",
    "originally , the ks equation was developed to describe the flame front flutter in laminar flames , @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits in its space - periodic form a spatio - temporal chaotic behaviour , with some similarities to turbulence @xcite .",
    "the standard ks equation reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time , @xmath16 the spatial coordinate and @xmath17 the velocity .",
    "the boundary conditions accompanying ( [ eqn : kuramoto - equation - dim ] ) are periodic in @xmath18 . the second term on the left side in ( [ eqn : kuramoto - equation - dim ] )",
    "is the nonlinear convection term , while on the right side two viscosity terms appear .",
    "the two latter terms may be associated to the production and dissipation of energy at different spatial scales .",
    "in particular , the second - order derivative term is related to the production of the energy via the variable @xmath19 , called _ anti - viscosity _ , while the dissipation of the energy is connected to the fourth - order derivative term , multiplied by the _ hyper - viscosity _",
    "@xmath20 , @xcite .    equation ( [ eqn : kuramoto - equation - dim ] ) can be rewritten such that it is parametrized by a reynolds - number - like coefficient . introducing a reference length @xmath21 and a reference velocity @xmath22 ,",

    "we assume that the system is sufficiently close to a steady solution @xmath33 .",
    "then , it is possible to describe the dynamics of perturbations using the linearized ks equation .",

    "the localization ( size and distance between elements ) of sensors and actuators may significantly influence efficiency of the compensator @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an important question one must address for mimo systems is how to connect inputs to outputs . a first approach consists of coupling one actuator with only one sensor ( for instance , the one upstream ) ; in this case , the number of single - input single - output ( siso ) _ control units _ equals the number of sensor / actuator pairs .",
    "this approach is called _ decentralized _ control - design ; despite its simplicity in practical implementations , the stability in closed loop is not guaranteed @xcite . the dual approach where only one control - unit is designed and",
    "all the sensors are coupled to all the available actuators is called _ centralized _ control . in @xcite , the centralized - controller strategy was found necessary for the design of a stable ts - wave controller .",
    "the main drawback of a fully centralized - control approach is that the number of connections for a flat plate of large span quickly becomes impractical due to all the wiring .",
    "one may then introduce a _ semi - decentralized _",
    "controller @xcite , where small mimo control - units are designed and connected to each other ; in @xcite , it is shown that a number of control - units can efficiently replace a full centralized control with a limited lost of performance .",
    "another important aspect that has be accounted for in a mimo setting , is the choice of the objective function @xmath8 .",
    "the minimization of a set of signals obtained from localized outputs with compact support does not necessarily correspond to a reduction of the actual perturbation amplitude in a global sense . for 1d and 2d flow systems",
    "any measurement taken locally , close to the solid wall and downstream in the computational domain , is sufficient for obtaining consistency between the perturbation and signal minimization @xcite ; this is not the case for 3d systems .",
    "an optimal way for choosing the output @xmath97 is the _ output projection _ suggested by @xcite , where a projection on a pod basis is performed .",
    "the resulting signal @xmath83 corresponds to the amplitude coefficients of the pod modes , i.e.  the temporal behaviour of the most energetic coherent structure of the flow .",
    "this method can also provide useful guidelines for the location of output sensors .",
    "this work provides a comprehensive review on standard model - based techniques ( lqr , kalman filter , lqg , mpc ) and model - free techniques ( lms , x - filtered lms ) for the delay of the transition from laminar to turbulence .",
    "we have focussed on the control of perturbation evolving in convective flows , using the linearized kuramoto - sivashinsky equation as a model of the flow over the flat - plate to characterize and compare these techniques .",
    "indeed , this model provides the two important traits of convectively unstable fluid systems , namely , the amplifying behaviour of a stable system and a very large time delay .",
    "much research have been performed on flow control using the very elegant techniques based on lqr and lqg , @xcite .",
    "although , these techniques may lead to the best possible performance and they have stability guarantees ( under certain restrictions ) , their implementation in experimental flow control settings raises a number obstacles : ( 1 ) the choice of actuator and sensor placement that yields a good performance of convectively unstable systems results in a feedforward system .",
    "we have highlighted the robustness issues arising from this configuration when using standard lqg - based techniques .",
    "( 2 ) disturbances , such as free - stream turbulence , and actuators , such as plasma actuators , can be difficult to model under realistic conditions .",
    "( 3 ) the requirement of solving two riccati equations is a major computational hassle , although it has successfully been addressed by the community using model - order reduction techniques @xcite or iterative methods @xcite .",
    "model - free techniques based on classical system - identification methods or adaptive - noise - cancellation techniques can cope with the limitations of model - based methods , @xcite .",
    "for example , we have presented algorithms that improve robustness by adapting to varying and un - modelled conditions .",
    "however , model - free techniques have their own limitations ; ( i ) one may often encounter instabilities , which in contrast to lqr / lqg , can not always be addressed in a straight - forward manner by using concepts such as controllability and observability .",
    "( ii ) the number of free parameters ( such as the limits of the sums appearing in fir filters ) that need to be modelled are many and chosen in a somewhat _ ad - hoc _ manner .",
    "the conclusion is that there does not exist one single method that is able to deal with all issues , and the final choice depends on the particular conditions that must be addressed . while a model - based technique may provide optimality and physical insight",
    ", it may lack the robustness to uncertainties that adaptive methods are able to provide .",
    "we believe that future research will head towards hybrid methods , where controllers are partially designed using numerical simulations and partially using adaptive experiment - based techniques .",
    "the authors acknowledge support the swedish research council ( vr-2012 - 4246 , vr-2010 - 3910 ) and the linn flow centre .",
    "finite - difference ( fd ) schemes are used to approximate the spatial derivatives in ( [ eqn : lks ] ) . in particular , a centered scheme based on stencils of five - nodes are used for the second - order and fourth - order derivatives while a one - node - backward scheme is used for the first - order derivative .",
    "the latter is required due to the convective nature of the system : a de - centered scheme reduces the spurious , numerical oscillation of the approximated solution@xcite .",
    "the grid is equispaced @xmath367 , with @xmath368 .",
    "once the fd scheme is introduced , the time evolution at each of the internal node is solution of the ode equation @xmath369 where @xmath370 for @xmath371 .",
    "the outflow boundary conditions in ( [ eqn : bc - l ] ) on the right boundary of the domain lead to the linear system of equations , @xmath372 the solution of this system allows us to express the boundary nodes @xmath373 as a linear combination of the inner nodes .",
    "similarly , the left boundary condition in ( [ eqn : bc-0 ] ) leads to an expression for the nodes @xmath374 : @xmath375 where a forward fd scheme is used for the first - order derivative approximation .",

    "the crank - nicolson method is used to march the system forward in time ( [ eqn : space - state - detailed ] ) . given a time step @xmath102 , the value of the state @xmath380 is given by the expression : @xmath381\\ ] ] where @xmath382 and @xmath383 .",
