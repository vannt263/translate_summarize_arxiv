    "the asymptotic plateau problem in hyperbolic space asks the existence of an absolutely area minimizing hypersurface @xmath5 asymptotic to given closed codimension-@xmath0 submanifold @xmath6 in @xmath1 .",

    "then , hardt and lin generalized this result to the closed codimension-@xmath0 submanifolds bounding star shaped domains in @xmath1 in @xcite .",

    ", we will show that the space of closed codimension-@xmath0 submanifolds in @xmath1 bounding a unique absolutely area minimizing hypersurface in @xmath2 is dense in the space of all closed codimension-@xmath0 submanifolds in @xmath1 by using a simple topological argument . on the other hand , in dimension @xmath3 , we show that the space of jordan curves in @xmath4 bounding a unique area minimizing surface in @xmath7 is generic in the space of jordan curves in @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , we show that the same is true for the least area planes in @xmath7 , too .",

    "then @xmath14 is dense in @xmath12 .    indeed , this subspace of closed submanifolds in @xmath1 bounding a unique absolutely area minimizing hypersurface is not only dense , but also generic in some sense .",
    "see remark 4.2 . on the other hand , in dimension @xmath3 , by combination of these two theorems ,",
    "we get the following corollary .",
    "* corollary 4.5 .",
    "* let @xmath8 be the space of simple closed curves in @xmath4 and let @xmath9 be the subspace containing the simple closed curves in @xmath4 bounding a unique absolutely area minimizing surface in @xmath7 .",
    "then , @xmath10 is generic in @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath11 is a set of first category .",
    "the short outline of the technique for generic uniqueness is the following : for simplicity , we will focus on the case of the least area planes in @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a simple closed curve in @xmath4 .",
    "first , we will show that either there exists a unique least area plane @xmath16 in @xmath7 with @xmath17 , or there exist two _ disjoint _ least area planes @xmath18 in @xmath7 with @xmath19 .",
    "now , take a small neighborhood @xmath20 which is an annulus . then foliate @xmath21 by simple closed curves @xmath22 where @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 . by the above fact , for any @xmath25 either there exists a unique least area plane @xmath26 , or there are two least area planes @xmath27 disjoint from each other .",
    "also , since these are least area planes , if they have disjoint asymptotic boundary , then they are disjoint by meeks - yau exchange roundoff trick .",
    "this means , if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 is disjoint and _ below _ from @xmath30 in @xmath7 . consider this collection of least area planes .",
    "note that for curves @xmath25 bounding more than one least area plane , we have a canonical region @xmath31 in @xmath7 between the disjoint least area planes @xmath27 , see figure 1 .",
    "now , @xmath32 separates @xmath4 into two parts , and take a geodesic @xmath33 which is asymptotic to two points belongs to these two different parts .",
    "this geodesic is transverse to the collection of these least area planes asymptotic to the curves in @xmath22 .",
    "also , a finite segment of this geodesic intersects the entire collection .",
    "let the length of this finite segment be @xmath34 .",
    "now , the idea is to consider the _ thickness _ of the neighborhoods @xmath31 assigned to the asymptotic curves @xmath22 . let @xmath35 be the length of the segment @xmath36 of @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is the _ width _ of @xmath31 assigned to @xmath25 .",
    "then , the curves @xmath25 bounding more than one least area plane have positive width , and contributes to total thickness of the collection , and the curves bounding unique least area plane has @xmath40 width and do not contribute to the total thickness .",
    "since @xmath41 , the total thickness is finite .",
    "this implies for only countably many @xmath23 , @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath25 bounds more than one least area plane . for the remaining uncountably many @xmath23 , @xmath43 , and",
    "there exists a unique least area plane for those @xmath44 .",
    "this proves the space of jordan curves of uniqueness is dense in the space of jordan curves in @xmath4 .",
    "then , we will show this space is not only dense , but also generic .",
    "we should note that this technique is quite general and it can be applied to many different settings of the plateau problem ( see concluding remarks ) .    on the other hand , after the above generic uniqueness results , it is a reasonable question whether all simple closed curves in @xmath4 bound a unique absolutely area minimizing surface or a unique least area plane .",
    "it is still not known whether all simple closed curves in @xmath4 have a unique solution to the asymptotic plateau problem or not .",
    "the only known results about nonuniqueness also come from anderson in @xcite .",
    "he constructs examples of simple closed curves in @xmath4 bounding more than one complete _ minimal surface _ in @xmath7 .",
    "these examples are also area minimizing in their topological class . however",
    ", none of them are absolutely area minimizing , i.e. a solution to the asymptotic plateau problem .    in this paper",
    ", we show the existence of simple closed curves in @xmath4 with nonunique solution to the asymptotic plateau problem .",
