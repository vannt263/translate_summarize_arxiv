    "in contrast , when the gravitational potential has approximate symmetries that restrict orbital evolution ( e.g. fixed ellipses in a keplerian potential ; fixed orbital planes in a spherical potential ) , the perturbations on a test star are no longer random , but correlated , leading to coherent ( @xmath86 ) torquing of @xmath81 on short timescales , while the symmetries hold . over longer times , this results in resonant relaxation ( rr ) @xcite , a rapid random walk of @xmath81 on the typically short rr timescale @xmath87 .",
