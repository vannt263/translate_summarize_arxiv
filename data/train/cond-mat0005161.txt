    "understanding of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems , including spin glasses , structural glasses , supraconductor vortex glasses , _ etc _ , is a challenging problem .",
    "the need for exact , but non trivial results led to the introduction of ideal spin - glasses , like the celebrated sherrington - kirkpatrick model  @xcite .",
    "the spherical @xmath0-spin glass is such a model , where a closed set of equations exists for the time correlation functions of the dynamical variables , or soft spins  @xcite . in the thermodynamical limit ,",
    "each spin becomes coupled to an infinity of other spins .",
    "each variable experiences gaussian fluctuations in the effective environment created by all the other spins .",
    "the dynamics then simplifies drastically , and reduces to a set of correlation functions which have to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the result is the `` dynamical mean - field solution '' of the model .",
    "the mean - field dynamics of spin - glasses has revealed extremely rich , the most striking feature being the existence of a non - trivial aging relaxation regime at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the solution of the mean - field equations in this out - of - equilibrium regime demonstrate the existence of a generalised fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( _ i.e. _ connecting correlation and response functions ) whose validity seems now to extend to many realistic , non mean - field , models  @xcite .",
    "then , mean - field solutions are valuable for explaining the experimental aging of disordered magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "finally , a sustained interest has followed the discovery of a deep formal analogy between the mode coupling description of structural glasses ( supercooled liquids ) and the mean field treatment of the spherical @xmath0-spin glass  @xcite .",
    "a crucial shortcoming of the mean - field description , however , is its inability to take into account properly thermally activated motion over energy barriers , leading to a sharp dynamical transition  divergence of an internal relaxational time scale  whereas the corresponding `` finite dimensional '' behaviour is only a strong but progressive slowing down of the dynamics .    despite of this last point ,",
    "mean - field dynamics remains a major issue in the study of out - of - equilibrium statistical physics of disordered systems , and any approach providing a physical insight on its aging mechanism is of interest . a major step in that direction",
    "was made by j.kurchan and l.laloux  @xcite who investigated the zero temperature relaxation of systems including ferromagnets and spin glasses .",
    "the zero temperature limit makes it possible to consider the energy landscape , rather than a ill - defined `` free - energy '' landscape , without reducing the dynamics to anything trivial .    in this work , we extend further their approach , and apply it to another system of interest : the mean - field dynamics of a particle in a short - range correlated random potential .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium , aging dynamics of this model has been first studied in  @xcite , and thoroughly investigated in  @xcite .",
    "its glassy behaviour belongs to the same universality class than the spherical @xmath0-spin model .",
    "what makes this model interesting is its natural extension , when a finite and constant external force is applied to the particle .",
    "then , it becomes a paradigm of `` driven glassy system '' , in which a non - linear response to the force as well as a significant violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem are expected , as shown by horner  @xcite .    in this paper , we present the dynamical mean - field equations in the presence of a constant force , allowing for an arbitrary mean displacement along this one .",
    "these equations are then numerically solved , in the zero temperature limit , for an exponentially decreasing correlator , in the absence , and in the presence of a weak external force .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are presented , restricting ourselves to the linear response regime .",
    "then , we start our geometrical analysis of the zero temperature relaxation by a simple random matrix calculation that we believe to describe satisfactorily the hessian of the exponentially correlated gaussian potential .",
    "next , we perform an `` instantaneous normal mode '' analysis of the relaxational motion .",
    "the key observable turns out to be the ( intensive ) energy difference between the energy @xmath1 at a given time @xmath2 , and its asymptotic value @xmath3 .",
    "we subsequently analyse the waiting time dependence of two characteristic time scales @xmath4 , that we relate to @xmath5 .",
    "this work is preliminary to the study of the stationary driven situation in the presence of a finite force , which will be the subject of a forthcoming publication , and where the velocity - force characteristics , and the cross - over between linear and non - linear response will be exposed  @xcite .",

    "this choice becomes equivalent to start with a random , `` infinite temperature '' distribution of initial positions .",
