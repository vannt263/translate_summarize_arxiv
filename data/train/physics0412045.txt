    "investigations on propagation of pulse signals in dispersive media date back to the beginning of 20th century .",
    "the fundamental research in this area is due to sommerfeld @xcite and brillouin @xcite .",
    "although steady interest in this kind of propagation was observed in the literature since then , a new impetus has been added recently due to new applications of the theory in fiber - optics communication and integrated - optics .",
    "also , the knowledge of pulse propagation in a dispersive medium , and of accompanying electromagnetic energy losses in the medium , became of vital importance in radiotherapy .",
    "a significant contribution to the research on dispersion phenomena in lorentz media is due to oughstun and sherman @xcite .",
    "equipped with better computation techniques and advanced asymptotic methods , they extended the analysis to models more closely reflecting practical applications .",
    "in particular , they considered signals with a finite rise time and employed uniform asymptotic expansions in their analysis .",
    "( uniform expansions remain valid as their parameters vary while non - uniform expansions break down at some parameters values . )    here , we also consider the evolution of the main signal excited in a lorentz dispersive medium by a signal with a finite rise time .",
    "however , unlike oughstun and sherman work , where the envelope of the initial signal is described by an everywhere smooth function of time which tends to zero as time goes to minus infinity , our exciting signal is switched abruptly at a finite time instant , and vanishes identically for earlier times . in the analysis carried out in this paper",
    "we apply the bleistein and handelsman @xcite theory of uniform asymptotic evaluation of integrals with nearby saddle point and an algebraic singularity .",
    "we show , how the uniform representation of the evolution of the main signal reduces to the non - uniform representation , which can otherwise be obtained by residues .",
    "the results obtained here are illustrated with a numerical example .",
    "consider the problem of an electromagnetic plane wave propagation in a homogeneous , isotropic medium , whose dispersive properties are described by the lorentz model of resonance polarization .",
    "the complex index of refraction in the medium is given by @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the number of electrons per unit volume , electron charge and its mass , respectively , @xmath5 is a damping constant and @xmath6 is a characteristic frequency .",

    "the uniqueness of this solution is proved in sec .  2 of @xcite .",
    "in this work we study the poles contribution to the asymptotic expansion of @xmath27 .",
    "we denote this contribution by @xmath28 and find both non - uniform and uniform asymptotic expressions for it .",
    "in finding an asymptotic expansion of the integral defined by ( [ e9 ] ) it is essential to determine the location of its critical points , including saddle points and the poles in the complex @xmath29-plane .",
    "the equation governing the location of the saddle points does not seem to be solvable exactly . instead",
    ", different approximate solutions were obtained by brillouin @xcite , kelbert and sazonov @xcite , and oughstun and sherman @xcite to describe the location .",
    "recently , a new approximation for this location was obtained in @xcite . in this work , however , we shall employ a numerical approximation of the saddle point solution obtained with the help of the _ mathematica _ computer program , and based on interpolation techniques .",
    "as in oughstun and sherman study , we deform the original contour of integration to the olver type contour @xmath30 @xcite which passes through the near and distant saddle points . the pole contribution to",
    "the asymptotic expansion of ( [ e9 ] ) occurs if in the process of contour deformation one or more poles of @xmath31 are crossed . from the series representation of the function @xmath31 @xcite @xmath32",
    "it follows that the integrand in ( [ e9 ] ) has an infinite set of poles @xmath33 , @xmath34 , in the half - plane i m @xmath35 , which are located along a line , parallel to the @xmath29 imaginary axis .",
    "if @xmath36 is big enough , only the real pole @xmath37 is of importance , since the remaining poles are not crossed in the process of contour deformation .",
    "if , however , @xmath36 is small , one or more of the remaining poles can be crossed , and their contributions must then be taken into account .",
    "let @xmath38 be the value of @xmath39 , at which the deformed contour crosses the pole at @xmath37 in ( [ e9 ] ) , @xmath9 being real and positive .",

    "the pole contribution ( [ e14 ] ) represents a discontinuous function of @xmath39 , while the integral representation of @xmath27 changes continuously with @xmath39 . as pointed in @xcite , this fact is of little significance if @xmath13 is finite and the pole is bounded away from the dominant saddle point at @xmath48 .",
    "denote @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50 is negligible in comparison to the saddle point contribution which has the magnitude @xmath51 .",
    "hence , the discontinuous behaviour of @xmath28 is then also negligible .",
    "the situation becomes different if the dominant saddle point approaches the pole at @xmath37 . in this case",
    "@xmath52 is comparable with @xmath53 and so are the pole and the branch point contributions to the asymptotic expansion of @xmath27 . to obtain a continuous asymptotic representation for @xmath28 , a uniform approach , as proposed by bleistein and handelsman @xcite will here be used .",

    "this term can be interpreted as due to the saddle point @xmath70 .    if , @xmath102 , which occurs after the contour crosses the pole , then in addition to the term proportional to @xmath101 , a new term appears @xmath103\\right].\\ ] ] it represents the main signal and its form fully agrees with ( [ e11 ] ) .    in this manner",
    "we have obtained both uniform and non - uniform asymptotic representations for the evolution of the main signal in the medium , which are described by ( [ e34 ] ) and ( [ e37 ] ) , respectively .",
    "while the uniform representation applies for any value of @xmath94 , the non - uniform representation is valid only for sufficiently large values of @xmath96 .",
    "one remark should now be made .",
    "the applied theory assumes that the saddle point is of the first order , i.e.  @xmath104 is never zero . in the present context",
    "this assumption is satisfied everywhere except for the special value of @xmath105 , where two coalescing near simple saddle points merge on the @xmath29-imaginary axis to form a saddle point of the second order .",
    "hence @xmath106 at @xmath105 , and consequently both asymptotic representations of @xmath28 , as given by ( [ e34 ] ) and ( [ e37 ] ) , are there invalid .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , if the carrier frequency @xmath9 lies below anomalous dispersion region , ( [ e34 ] ) is a uniform if @xmath107 .",
    "a numerical example is now given to illustrate the results obtained in the previous section .",
    "it is assumed that the lorentz medium is described by brillouin s choice of medium parameters @xmath108 and additionally , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the latter choice implies that in this example the saddle point in question is the near one .",
    "let us first suppose that the parameter @xmath36 in ( [ e6 ] ) is large enough , say of the order of @xmath111 or more , to ensure that the second pole @xmath112 is sufficiently distant from the contour @xmath113 , and , in particular , it is not crossed in the process of the contour deformation .",
    "then only the real pole at @xmath37 is of interest . under this assumption",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath66 , as given by ( [ e17 ] ) , are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to determine numerical values of the function @xmath114 an interpolation technique provided by the _ mathematica _ computer program has been employed .",
    "the evolution of the main signal , as predicted by the uniform asymptotic representation ( [ e34 ] ) , is depicted in fig .  2 . the anomaly in the plot at @xmath115 , results from vanishing @xmath104 at @xmath105 , and ,",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the result obtained from ( [ e34 ] ) breaks down there .",
    "3 shows the corresponding plot obtained from ( [ e34 ] ) , in which the term proportional to @xmath116 , has been dropped .",
    "assume now that @xmath36 is sufficiently small , such that the second pole at @xmath112 can appear close to , or be crossed by the deformed contour @xmath113 . to fix our attention",
    "let @xmath117 . in this case",
    "an expression similar to ( [ e34 ] ) must be added to the asymptotic representation for @xmath28 . by virtue of ( [ e10 ] )",
    ", the expression should be multiplied by the factor @xmath118 , and @xmath119 should replace @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding plot is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that now the growth of the main signal is slower then in fig .",
    "in this paper the problem of electromagnetic signal propagation in a dispersive lorentz medium is considered .",
    "it is assumed that the exciting signal is turned on at a finite time instant .",
    "the signal rapidly oscillates and its envelope is described by a hyperbolic tangent function . while propagating in the medium , the signal splits into three components : sommerfeld and brillouin precursors , and the main signal . in this work",
    "we find both non - uniform and uniform asymptotic representations for the main signal evolution .",
    "the former representation is readily obtainable by residues .",
    "the latter representation is constructed with the help of bleistein - handelsman method of uniform asymptotic evaluation of integrals with nearby simple saddle point and an algebraic singularity .",
