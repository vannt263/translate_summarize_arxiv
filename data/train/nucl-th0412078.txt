    "in this paper we study the nature of resonance states in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "all these nuclei have a rich structure of resonance states @xcite .",
    "there are 4 well - determined resonances in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and up to 15 resonance states were detected in @xmath1 .",
    "most of these resonances have a width that is much larger than the resonance energy when measured from the lowest threshold .",
    "although these resonances have been experimentally confirmed , they can hardly be observed in current theoretical model descriptions of these systems through standard elastic and inelastic scattering quantities such as @xmath4-matrix elements , differential or total cross sections , and so on .    for many years",
    ", the four - nucleon system was studied by different microscopic and semi - microscopic methods .",
    "different forms of the schrdinger equation ( differential ( @xcite ) , integral ( @xcite ) , integro - differential @xcite , matrix or algebraic(@xcite ) , ... ) have been used to study these nuclei .",
    "special attention was paid to @xmath1 , the only nuclear 4-particle system featuring a bound state .",
    "the theoretical study of the ground state  of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and of the excited states of all three nuclei were investigated mainly through resonance state analysis .",
    "of all resonances , the first excited @xmath5 state has received most attention . in none of the descriptions",
    "the role of the three - cluster channels was properly considered , and so resonance states induced by this channel could not be theoretically discovered and analyzed .    our objective is to determine the type and nature of resonance states in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 that are reproduced within a three - cluster microscopic model .",
    "for all three nuclei we will consider one single three - cluster configuration @xmath3 .",
    "this is certainly the most dominant three - cluster channel , as it has the lowest energy threshold .",
    "moreover one can easily construct all binary channels for these nuclei within such description . in @xmath1 for example this configuration allows to study resonances created by the two - cluster channels @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as by the three - cluster channel  @xmath9 .",
    "the latter should be very important , because 7 resonance states were detected above the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "it is interesting to note in the same context that all four resonance states of @xmath0 lie below the three - cluster @xmath10 threshold , whereas in @xmath2 two resonances are found above the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "we propose a modification of the method formulated in @xcite , and used in @xcite to study resonances embedded in the three - cluster continuum , and reactions with three cluster exit channels .",
    "the method was shown to provide a suitable instrument for investigating borromian nuclei ( for instance @xmath12 ) and nuclei with prominent three - cluster features ( like @xmath13 ) .",
    "we wish to extend the method proposed in @xcite to handle systems in which binary channels play a prominent role , by including the correct boundary conditions for both binary and ternary channels .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite and in @xcite allow us to restrict the model space to the most relevant subspace .    to reach this objective we have to :    * specify the microscopic modelling of the three - cluster configuration , and the approximations to be used in calculations , * construct a set of dynamic equations that take into account the  proper boundary conditions for both binary and ternary channels , * implement reliable numerical methods to calculate continuous spectrum wave functions and @xmath4-matrix elements .",
    "we propose the following trial wave function for the 4-particle systems@xmath14   \\right\\ }   , ~\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the antisymmetric and translationally invariant internal wave function of the @xmath16  nucleon system , and @xmath17 are the familiar jacobi coordinates denoting ( @xmath18 ) the relative position of two of the clusters , and ( @xmath19 ) the relative position of the third cluster with respect to the former two - cluster subsystem@xmath20   , \\nonumber\\\\ \\mathbf{q}_{\\alpha }   &   = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_{\\alpha}\\left (   a_{\\beta}+a_{\\gamma } \\right )   } { a_{\\alpha}+a_{\\beta}+a_{\\gamma}}}\\left [   \\frac{\\sum_{i\\in a_{\\alpha}}\\mathbf{r}_{i}}{a_{\\alpha}}-\\frac{\\sum_{j\\in a_{\\beta}}\\mathbf{r}_{j}+\\sum_{k\\in a_{\\gamma}}\\mathbf{r}_{k}}{a_{\\beta}+a_{\\gamma}}\\right ]   , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 a cyclic permutations of @xmath22 .",
    "the three components of the wave functions @xmath23 ( more precisely @xmath24 ) have to be determined by solving the many - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "specific symmetries of the system can reduce the number of components : if the three - cluster configuration contains two identical clusters , only two distinguishable components @xmath25 will occur ; this is the case for @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "if all three clusters are identical ( impossible for the 4-particle system though ) , only one independent component @xmath26 would occur .",
    "we shall use a matrix or algebraic form of the schrdinger equation . to this aim",
    "we expand the wave function @xmath27 in an oscillator basis ( referred to as a bioscillator  ( bo ) basis):@xmath28 where@xmath29 and @xmath30 is the familiar ( radial ) oscillator function:@xmath31 the total angular momentum @xmath32 of the three @xmath33-clusters is a vector sum of two partial angular momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 associated with the respective jacobi coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "as each cluster function @xmath15 is antisymmetric by construction , the antisymmetrization operator in ( [ eq : a001 ] ) only involves the permutation of nucleons between clusters , and it can be represented as@xmath36 where @xmath37 exchanges nucleons from clusters @xmath38  and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 permutes particles from all three clusters . in some respects this antisymmetrization operator is similar to a short range interaction . indeed , the antisymmetrization is noticeable only when the distance between clusters is small . at larger distances",
    "both the potential energy and the antisymmetrization effects become negligibly small .",
    "the operator @xmath40 is important only when the distance between all three clusters is less than a certain restricted value .",
    "if one of the clusters ( say , cluster @xmath38 ) is far away from the two other clusters @xmath39 and @xmath41 , and the latter are close to one other , @xmath42 will have a pronounced contribution , as well as the two - cluster interaction @xmath43 derived from the @xmath44-potential .",
    "each set of jacobi coordinate @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and each set of oscillator functions ( [ eq : a004 ] ) @xmath45 for @xmath46 1 , 2 or 3 cover the whole configuration space ( i.e. account for all possible relative positions of three clusters in space ) .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the subspace @xmath47 of the total hilbert space .",
    "two arguments for such a choice can be given ( in particular for the 4-particle system ) :    1 .",
    "we deal with @xmath33-shell clusters , and the two - cluster compound subsystems also are @xmath33-shell nuclei ; the latter ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 have a ground state containing a dominant @xmath4-wave contribution .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this subspace dominates in the full hilbert space .",
    "for instance , the ground state energy of @xmath12 and @xmath51 obtained within this subspace differs less than 1% from the energy obtained in the full hilbert space .",
    "it was also shown that this subspace dominates in the wave function of the @xmath52 state of @xmath12 , appearing as a resonance embedded in the three - cluster continuum @xmath53 , as well .    to include the proper boundary conditions , we will split the oscillator space @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) into the internal and asymptotic parts .",
    "the former consists of the basis functions of the lowest @xmath56 oscillator shells ( i.e. all functions with @xmath57 ; it involves @xmath58 basis functions for each value of @xmath38 ) . with this size of the internal region in oscillator space",
    "one can evaluate the maximal size of the three - cluster system in coordinate space by using the correspondence between oscillator and coordinate representations ( see details in @xcite)@xmath59    if , for instance , the oscillator length @xmath60 fm and @xmath61 , then @xmath62 fm .",
    "the maximal distance between any pair of clusters will be of the same magnitude .",
    "@xmath63  also corresponds to the minimal size of the three - cluster system in the asymptotic region .",
    "so in the internal region all three clusters are close to each other , which means that all antisymmetrization components are important , as well as all interactions between clusters .    in the asymptotic region",
    "we distinguish two different regimes . in the first regime",
    "the distance between two clusters is small , while the third one is far apart . in the second regime",
    "all three clusters are well separated . if a selected pair of clusters ( say , @xmath39  and @xmath41  clusters ) has ( a ) bound state(s ) , then the first regime is responsible for scattering of the third cluster on the compound @xmath64 subsystem .",
    "this process can be described by two - body asymptotics .",
    "the second regime is associated with the full disintegration of the three - cluster system , with three independent ( non - interacting ) clusters .",
    "these two regimes have to be treated differently .",
    "this means that two different forms of the wave function have to be used to properly describe these processes .",
    "it will require some reconstruction of the basis functions in order to suit both two- and three - body physical processes in the exit channels .    in the first regime of the asymptotics we can neglect all antisymmetrization components but @xmath42 . as for the potential energy ,",
    "the most important contribution is generated by the two - cluster potential @xmath43 .",
    "the other components @xmath65 and @xmath66 , originating from the short - range @xmath44-forces , are negligibly small , and only long - range coulomb forces are of importance .",
    "the wave function in coordinate and oscillator representation can then be factorized as@xmath67 the two - cluster wave function @xmath68 , and its counterpart in oscillator space @xmath69 , is an eigenfunction of the two - cluster hamiltonian @xmath70 @xmath71 by solving the schrdinger equation @xmath72 with a chosen number of  basis functions @xmath73 , we obtain the bound state(s ) @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) of the two - cluster subsystem , which determine the threshold energy of the two - body break up of the tree - cluster system .    in the second regime of the asymptotics",
    "we can neglect the antisymmetrization operator and the short - range components of the inter - cluster potential .",
    "in this regime , we use the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) basis to describe the full decay of the three - cluster system , because ( see , for instance , @xcite ) this basis is the obvious choice for such type of three cluster behavior . the transition from the bioscillator basis @xmath76 to the hh basis @xmath77 ( see details of the definition of hh functions in e.g. @xcite ) is performed by an orthogonal matrix .",
    "this transformation can be calculated in a straightforward way .",
    "the asymptotic part of the wave function will then be represented by two sets of expansion coefficients @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "all expansion coefficients in the asymptotic region have a similar form , and consist of incoming ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) and outgoing ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) waves ( see detail of the definition in @xcite):@xmath84 , \\label{eq : a009}\\\\ c_{n_{\\rho},k;l}^{\\left (   \\alpha\\right )   }   &   \\simeq\\left (   2\\rho_{n}\\right ) ^{2}\\left [   \\delta_{c_{0};\\alpha k}~\\psi_{k}^{\\left (   -\\right )   } \\left ( k\\rho_{n}\\right )   -s_{c_{0};\\alpha k}~\\psi_{k}^{\\left (   + \\right )   } \\left ( k\\rho_{n}\\right )   \\right ]   , \\label{eq : a010}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath85 denotes the entrance channel and@xmath86 note that the index @xmath38 numerates the binary channels , while both indexes @xmath38 and @xmath87 distinguish the ternary channels .",
    "thus @xmath85 equals @xmath88 , if the entrance channel is a binary one , or @xmath89 for the three - cluster entrance channel .    with this definition of the asymptotic part of the wave function we deduce the equations for the scattering parameters and wave function . by taking into account ( [ eq : schromatr ] ) , ( [ eq : a008 ] ) , ( [ eq : a009 ] ) and ( [ eq : a010 ] ) one obtains@xmath90 this system of linear equations contains in  the general case of three different clusters @xmath91 parameters to be determined .",
    "here@xmath92 is the number of hh channels . from this total amount ,",
    "@xmath93 coefficients represent the wave function in the internal region , and the other @xmath94 parameters determine the elastic and inelastic processes , leading to two or three clusters in the exit channels .",
    "these parameters unambiguously define the wave functions in the asymptotic region .",
    "we use the minnesota ( mp ) @xcite , and the modified hasegawa - nagata ( mhnp ) @xcite nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath44 ) potentials .",
    "the oscillator radius @xmath95 is chosen to optimize the bound state energy of the deuteron , and equals @xmath96 fm for mp and @xmath97 fm for mhnp .",
    "considering these two potentials reveals the effect of peculiarities of @xmath44-forces on the parameters of resonance states .    in a first calculation",
    ", we neglect all binary channels , and only consider the three - cluster channels .",
    "this allows to understand what kind of resonances are generated by this channel only .",
    "we have omitted spin - orbital components of the @xmath44-forces to reduce the computational burden .",
    "results obtained in this approximation can be considered to represent a lower limit  for the width of a resonance , as additional channels will open new decay possibilities of the resonance , which will increase its width . in this respect",
    "the three - cluster approximation will indicate whether some resonances state(s ) could survive after binary channels are included .    by solving the dynamic equations ( [ eq : a012 ] ) for @xmath98 channels , we directly obtain the @xmath99 @xmath4-matrix .",
    "there are two different parametrizations for the @xmath4-matrix . in the first one ,",
    "each element @xmath100 can be represented by the phase shift @xmath101 and the inelastic parameter @xmath102 : @xmath103 . in the second parametrization the @xmath4-matrix",
    "is reduced to diagonal form by an orthogonal transformation:@xmath104 the latter procedure leads to @xmath98 uncoupled elastic eigenchannels , whose ( eigen)phase shifts parametrize the diagonalized @xmath105-matrix .",
    "we use the eigenphase shifts to determine both the energy and width of the resonances .",
    "they are obtained from the following equations@xmath106    we start our analysis from eigenphase shift . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4li_eigenphases_l1_s1 ] we display eigenphase shift    [ ptb ]    4li_eignphases_l1_s1.eps    of so - called 3@xmath1073 scattering for @xmath108 , @xmath109 state in the @xmath2 , obtained with the minnesota potential .",
    "similar pictures are obtained for other nuclei and different ( @xmath110 , @xmath4 ) states and also with the mhn potential .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:4li_eigenphases_l1_s1 ] that there are two resonance states in @xmath2 , first resonance is narrow and manifest itself through the first eigenchannel , while the second resonance is very broad and appear in the third eigenchannel .",
    "the eigenphase shifts provide with a direct and simple way to determine the energy and width of a resonance state in the three - cluster continuum , but to get information concerning the main features of the three - cluster dynamics one needs to analyze the phase shifts @xmath101 and the inelastic parameters @xmath102 .    in figs .",
