    "<S> the behavior near @xmath35 was explained in the two - fluid model by a crossover from the kondo spin - liquid ( ksl ) to kondo fermi - liquid ( kfl ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use a term of kondo - liquid ( kl ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nf - t](c ) to comprise both ksl and kfl phases .    </S>",
    "<S> thus g - sms exhibits a crossover from mixed - valence to kondo lattice behavior upon cooling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charge - fluctuation that starts to be effective at @xmath52 k becomes almost frozen at @xmath51 k , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nf - t](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the spin - fluctuation becomes dominating near @xmath55 k , so as to activate the kondo screening . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the effective hybridization obtained in the dmft becomes the largest near @xmath56 k @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , @xmath51 k of the dip structure coincides with @xmath5 , at which the upper @xmath14 flat band ( @xmath34 doublet ) along @xmath38 is detached from @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the resistivity up - turn occurs due to the apparent pseudo - gap ( pg ) feature , and so we assign @xmath40 k as @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this kind of hump and dip structure in the resistivity has been observed in several ce compounds of kondo - insulator type , such as cenisn and cerhsb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the third resistivity drop at @xmath11 k occurs due to the complete formation of the coherent @xmath14 band over the whole brillouin zone . below @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> k , the imaginary part of self - energy almost vanishes @xcite , whereby the crossover from the kl to the landau fermi - liquid ( lfl ) takes place @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so we assign @xmath11 k as @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , sms undergoes several crossover transitions upon cooling , from vf liquid ( vfl ) , kl , pg to lfl , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nf - t](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy scales @xmath53 , @xmath35 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , which are identified for sms , are considered to be universal to characterize kondo / mixed - valent semimetallic systems .    finally , it should be pointed out that the resistivity behavior in sms is quite different from that in smb@xmath49 that is a candidate of topological kondo insulators . </S>",
    "<S> g - sms is not a kondo insulator but close to a kondo semimetal , so that the conventional metallic resistivity behavior is expected to be realized at very low @xmath5 .    in conclusion , in g - sms , </S>",
    "<S> the coherent sm @xmath0 bands are formed upon cooling to produce the hybridization - induced pseudogap feature near @xmath6 , which is accompanied by a lifshitz - like topological transition in the fs . </S>",
    "<S> g - sms is found to be not a topological kondo semimetal in view of that the in - gap surface states are not topological states but are typical spin - polarized rashba states . from the analysis of @xmath5-dependent resistivity of g - sms , </S>",
    "<S> we have identified characteristic multiple energy scales , which are expected to govern the physics of kondo / mixed - valent semimetallic systems universally .    </S>",
