    "the emergence of spatio - temporal ordered structures in nonlinear systems is an ideal laboratory for investigating the trend toward complexification observed in nature at the physical , chemical , and biological level @xcite .",
    "it is known that localized , or spatially - bound , order emerges in systems which are out of thermodynamic equilibrium , at the expense of growing overall disorder @xcite .",
    "examples can be found in hydrodynamics , in networks of chemical reactions @xcite , in phase transitions and critical phenomena @xcite , and in living organisms @xcite .",
    "for these localized ordered structures to survive , they must interact with an external environment , which maintains nonequilibrium conditions : in general , an isolated nonlinear system will eventually reach equilibrium , maximizing its entropy to the detriment of localized ordered structures .    in other words , if localized ordered structures emerge during the approach to equilibrium of a closed system , they will eventually disappear as energy becomes increasingly equipartitioned amongst the system s many degrees of freedom .",
    "the emergence of localized ordered structures is thus a nonequilibrium phenomenon , usually corresponding to an unequal partitioning of energy : if they are long - lived , they will serve as bottlenecks to equipartition .",
    "[ an exception occurs for 1d field theories with sdw , where configurations such as kink - antikink pairs correspond to the equilibrium . ] following the pioneering work of fermi , pasta , and ulam in the early 1950s @xcite , several recent works have investigated the possibility that discrete kink - like structures may act as bottlenecks for equipartition in chains of nonlinear oscillators @xcite .    in field theory and cosmology ,",
    "most of the interest on ordered configurations has focused on topological ( kinks , vortices , monopoles ) @xcite or nontopological ( nontopological solitons , q - balls ) @xcite _ static _ solutions of the equations of motion . those configurations can be boosted towards each other with a certain velocity and made to interact , to model nonlinear composite particle interactions",
    ". a well - known example are 1-dimensional breathers , time - dependent bound states that have been shown to result from interactions of kink - antikink pairs @xcite .",
    "however , this is not surprising : any two or more static solitonic configurations with short - range attractive interactions can be prepared to generate spatially - bound time - dependent structures @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the spatially - bound , time - dependent structures of interest here , that emerge _ spontaneously _ during the nonlinear evolution of a system .",
    "we have recently found such structures in 2 + 1-dimensional simulations of nonlinear scalar field models @xcite .",
    "such structures were identified with oscillons , long - lived _ time - dependent _ localized field configurations that have been previously found deterministically in a variety of physical systems , ranging from field theory models with amplitude - dependent nonlinearities @xcite , vertically vibrated grains @xcite , and stellar interiors @xcite .    in this paper , we will examine the emergence of spatially - bound , time - dependent field configurations during the approach to equilibrium of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional scalar field models with typical double - well interactions .",
    "these interactions are controlled by a tunable external parameter , which can be interpreted as an extra interaction that may be switched on or off at will . in the parlance of ising magnetic systems ,",
    "the external interaction may be a spatially - homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath3 .",
    "we will investigate both the symmetric double - well ( sdw )  extending previous results of ref .",
    "@xcite  as well as provide new results for the asymmetric case ( adw ) .",
    "the interest in examining both cases stems from the fact that the ensuing dynamics will be quite different : while for the sdw the degeneracy in free energy density dictates that no critical nucleation is possible , this will not be the case for the adw .",
    "in fact , for the sdw we observe the synchronous emergence of long - lived localized configurations ( oscillons ) , which eventually disappear as the system reaches equipartition @xcite .",
    "we will argue that these configurations act as bottlenecks for equipartition , concentrating the field s energy in a narrow band of long - wavelength modes .",
    "for the adw , and with the system initially quenched to the metastable state , the synchronous emergence of oscillons may trigger the nucleation of a critical droplet of the lower free - energy phase , which grows to complete the phase transformation .",
    "we will show that , for a range of temperatures , the time - scales associated with this process are orders of magnitude faster than the typical statistical homogeneous nucleation , where a system _ adiabatically _ cooled into its metastable phase decays to its lowest free energy phase with typically exponentially - large time scales @xcite .",
    "in fact , the present treatment , with an `` instantaneous '' quench ( faster than other typical time - scales in the system ) , and the arbitrarily slow cooling implicit of homogeneous nucleation calculations , represent the two extreme cases of a whole spectrum of possible cooling rates . since we will argue that the emergence of coherent structures is due to the resonant amplification of parametric excitations of certain field modes , we will refer to this nucleation mechanism as _ resonant nucleation . _ anticipating one of our results , for field models described by amplitude - dependent scalar nonlinearities , resonant nucleation of spatio - temporal order will be relevant whenever the cooling time scale @xmath4 is faster than the equilibration time - scale of the longest wavelength in the system , @xmath5 . [",
    "the superscript `` 0 '' is a reminder that often the longest wavelength is associated with the zero mode of the system , which has the slowest relaxation time - scale .",
    "] we note that we will always work far from the critical point where , of course , @xmath6 . for our recent work on the approach to criticality",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the general properties of the model ( a general ginzburg - landau model ) , the initial conditions , and the numerical implementation of the dynamics . in section 3",
    "we present a mean field ( homogeneous hartree ) approximation adequate to describe the system in the presence of small fluctuations about equilibrium .",
    "the fact that the homogeneous hartree approximation breaks down as nonperturbative excitations become progressively more important will provide us with useful information about the emergence of ordered structures .",
    "in section 4 we argue that the emergence of spatio - temporal order is a consequence of parametric resonance , induced by the nonlinear coupling between the field s zero mode  the forcing agent  and smaller-@xmath7 modes .",
    "we also provide entropic arguments in support of the statement that the emergence of coherent spatio - temporal structures delays equipartition of the energy and , thus , the approach to equilibrium . in section 5 , we extend our investigation to adws . for",
    "a range of temperatures [ or initial energies , see below ] , we measure the time scales for the decay of the metastable state as a function of barrier height , contrasting them with those computed from homogeneous nucleation theory .",
    "we identify two possible mechanisms for the decay : for small asymmetries , a critical nucleus is produced by the coalescence of two or more oscillons , while for larger asymmetries a single oscillon evolves into a critical nucleus .",
    "we show that , for a range of temperatures associated with the presence of oscillons in the system , the time scale associated with the decay obeys a simple power law , @xmath8^b$ ] , where @xmath2 is the free - energy barrier of a critical fluctuation , and the exponent @xmath1 satisfying @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a summary of our results and outlook for future work .",
    "we start by introducing the model we will work with and its statistical and numerical implementation .",
    "we consider a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional real scalar field ( or scalar order parameter ) @xmath10 evolving under the influence of an on - site potential @xmath11 . if the system does not interact with an external bath , the continuum hamiltonian is conserved and gives the total energy of the system , for a given field configuration , @xmath12=\\int d\\,^2x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{t}\\phi)^2+\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2+v(\\phi)\\right ] , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the potential energy density .",
    "the parameters @xmath14,@xmath15 , and @xmath16 are positive definite and temperature independent . before we go any further , a note on our choice of potential .",
    "one could as easily have chosen a typical ginzburg - landau ( gl ) potential , @xmath17 , with @xmath3 an external homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the gl potential can be transformed into the potential of eq .",
    "[ v ] by a field shift , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the solution of the cubic equation @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we chose the potential of eq .",
    "[ v ] for convenience .",
    "our control parameter is @xmath15 .",
    "we note that when @xmath23 the potential is an anharmonic single well . in this case , there are no spinodal instabilities .",
    "( by spinodal instabilities we mean @xmath24 for certain values of @xmath25 , which may result in the unstable growth of modes . ) when @xmath26 ( in scaled units , see below ) the potential can assume a typical double - well shape [ sdw for equality and adw for @xmath27 , and spinodal instabilities are possible .",
    "we will thus refer to the interactions modeled by @xmath15 as destabilizing interactions ( dis ) .",
    "changing @xmath15 from an initial value of zero to a finite positive value can also be thought of as an `` instantaneous '' quench : the system , initially prepared in a single well , is `` tossed '' into a double - well potential within a time - scale much faster than any equilibration time - scale for longer wavelengths in the system , those with @xmath28 , where @xmath7 is the mode s wave number .",
    "we will say more about this later on .",
    "it is helpful to introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( henceforth dropping the primes ) .",
    "when @xmath33 the two minima are degenerate ( sdw ) . if @xmath34 , the @xmath35 symmetry is explicitly broken . we will only be concerned here with the cases modeled by @xmath36 . for @xmath37",
    "the minimum at @xmath38 becomes the local ( or metastable ) minimum ( adw ) and @xmath39 is the global minimum .",
    "a statistical description of the state of the system is given by a set of time - dependent observables @xmath40 , each one calculated as an ensemble average over @xmath41 realizations , or microstates .",
    "for example , @xmath42 in most cases , an observable within a particular microstate is itself an average over the area of the system , such as the average value of the field @xmath43 for the particular microstate @xmath44 .",
    "most of the observables considered will have this `` double '' averaging .",
    "such is the case for @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( the field s conjugate momentum ) , and the corresponding hierarchy of correlation functions .",
    "it will be noted when this is not the case , particularly when quantities are no longer assumed to be translationally invariant , such as those describing localized configurations .",
    "we prepare the field such that it is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath47 in the single - well ( @xmath23 ) potential at some time prior to the quench at @xmath48 , when @xmath15 is set to a nonzero value .",
    "when one is faced with a nonlinear equation of motion such as eq .",
    "[ lang ] below , the thermal probability distribution for @xmath49 can not be obtained exactly . to generate the initial conditions for each of the microstates in the ensemble",
    ", we instead couple the field in the single - well potential to a heat bath via a generalized langevin equation with additive noise , @xmath50 where the viscosity coefficient @xmath51 is related to the stochastic force of zero mean @xmath52 by the fluctuation - dissipation relation , @xmath53 eq . [ fd ] defines the two - point correlation function of the stochastic force , assumed here to be markovian . since this force will only be used during the preparation of the initial thermal state  after the quench the coupling with the bath is turned off ( @xmath54 )  this assumption is sufficient .",
    "[ however , it would be quite interesting to examine the effects of multiplicative noise in the nonequilibrium dynamics of this system when the contact with the thermal bath is kept throughout its evolution .",
    "[ the role of multiplicative noise on the onset of synchronization in 1 + 1-dimensional fields has been recently investigated by munz and pastor - satorras @xcite .",
    "] we note that even though we are preparing each microstate in an initial thermal state , there is a one to one correspondence between the temperature and the average energy of the field .",
    "in fact , we can refer to the ensemble prepared as above as a microcanonical ensemble , since each microstate has energy @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "such numerical accuracy in energy matches that obtained with other methods used preparing the initial state , including the popular monte carlo sampling .",
    "it simply expresses the fact that , for large enough lattices that approach the thermodynamic limit , there is an equivalence between canonical and microcanonical ensembles @xcite .",
    "the full evolution of the scalar field for each microstate is simulated using a staggered leapfrog integration of the equation of motion .",
    "it is implemented on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "integrations are performed with @xmath57 and @xmath58 with 1024 lattice sites per side .",
    "the field is then defined over an area with sides of length @xmath59 .",
    "the leapfrog scheme replaces second - order derivatives with finite - difference expressions that are accurate to @xmath60 .",
    "the lattice spacing and system size are chosen so that computations can be carried out in a timely manner , while the numerical values of any observables and their corresponding continuum values are in good agreement .",
    "for example , after the quench , the energy in this closed system is conserved by more than 1 part in @xmath61 .",
    "results are independent of lattice size , provided large enough lattices are used . finally , all of the observables",
    "are then averaged over an ensemble of @xmath62 microstates .",
    "we start our investigation using a familiar perturbative method , the leading order or homogeneous hartree approximation ( hha ) .",
    "an excellent account can be found in @xcite , where successive truncations within the hierarchy of correlation functions were used to simplify the equation of motion , all the while capturing the essential aspects of the dynamics .",
    "we will borrow many of the same methods and notation found in this reference .",
    "the hha assumes that the statistical distribution of the fluctuations in the field and its momentum remain gaussian throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "we will see that this is indeed an excellent approximation in the following cases : i ) just prior to the quench ( that is , the initial state of the field in a single well ) for all temperatures considered ; ii ) at all times after the quench when the temperature is low ; iii ) at very early times after the quench when the temperature is high .",
    "we start by considering the system before the quench is implemented ( @xmath23 ) , that is , the dynamics with the potential @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "a simple way to implement the hha in this situation is to factor the cubic term in eq .",
    "[ lang ] as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the translationally invariant mean - square variance of the field . since the field is in thermal equilibrium , @xmath65 is time - independent . in this approximation ,",
    "the equation of motion becomes linear , @xmath66 the fourier transform of the field is a complex quantity given by @xmath67 the corresponding equation of motion for @xmath68 in @xmath7-space is [ with @xmath69 @xmath70 with the effective frequency squared @xmath71 we have introduced the hartree mass @xmath72 . notice that when there are fluctuations in this field ( @xmath73 ) the effective hartree mass is greater than the `` bare '' mass ( @xmath74 ) given by the potential in eq .",
    "[ v ] . in this approximation ,",
    "the modes evolve independently of one another , just as they would in a linear truncation of the equation of motion , only now each interacts with the homogeneous mean - field background .",
    "a higher - order approximation is needed , however , to implement direct scattering between different modes .",
    "if the system is in thermal equilibrium , the momentum modes in @xmath7-space will satisfy @xmath75 it then follows from eq .",
    "[ eomk ] that the corresponding power spectrum for the field is @xmath76 to obtain the equilibrium quantity @xmath77 , one integrates eq .",
    "[ phimode ] over the entire @xmath7-space and divides by the area .",
    "( equivalently , one can integrate the corresponding two - point correlation function over @xmath78-space to obtain @xmath65 , since parseval s theorem guarantees that the two quantities are the same . )",
    "one must be careful here , since the lattice results depend logarithmically on the ultraviolet cutoff ( lattice - spacing ) .",

    "the dynamics for adw potentials will be examined in section 5 .    at @xmath48 the coupling to the bath",
    "is set to zero , and the dynamics is thus conservative thereafter .",
    "the system is closed , and can be described by a microcanonical ensemble of energy @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . as we remarked before , for large enough systems in equilibrium , as is the case here for @xmath88 , a description with fixed @xmath89",
    "is equivalent to one with fixed @xmath47 .",
    "we will use this initial temperature to characterize the system .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the thermodynamic limit , an instantaneous quench to _ any _ positive value of @xmath15 will not change the energy of the system .",
    "the field is initially symmetric in its distribution and the quench introduces an odd term into the hamiltonian . instead",
    ", the energy is redistributed between its kinetic , gradient , and potential parts , and as a result the final equilibrium temperature will necessarily differ from the initial temperature . in this investigation , however , this change is always less than @xmath90 percent . for open systems , where the system remains in contact with a heat bath , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    due to the initial thermal distribution ,",
    "defined entirely by the temperature @xmath47 , the sudden introduction of the cubic term into the potential actually has a minor effect on most of the field . in general , there is little net change in the forces present throughout the system , since the curvature of the single- and double - well potentials are the same at @xmath38 and the majority of the field is indeed close to this value ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "that is , the linear equation of motion remains unchanged for the small - amplitude fluctuations that represent the peak of the field s probability distribution .",
    "the few locations where the field is more responsive to the perturbation correspond to regions with relatively large absolute values of @xmath25 .",
    "these values define the tails of the probability distribution .",
    "the new nonlinear term present in the potential breaks the symmetry in the equation of motion , and this second - order effect causes larger - amplitude field fluctuations with negative ( positive ) values to experience a larger ( smaller ) restoring force than before .",
    "overall , a net positive force is imposed on the symmetrically prepared field and , as a consequence , its average starts at @xmath91 and then begins to move toward @xmath92 , the maximum of the potential barrier between the two states .",
    "we will see that @xmath45 is initially driven more out of equilibrium than all of the fluctuations about it .",

    "the turning - on of the interaction can be interpreted as a `` quench , '' as it occurs within a time - scale faster than any in the system .",
    "the system is thus tossed into a double - well potential and , through its nonlinear interactions , redistributes its energy until it reaches equipartition . for the sdw case ,",
    "we have observed that this approach to equilibrium occurs as a two - step energy cascade : quickly at first , as the zero - mode relinquishes its energy to nearby ( in @xmath7-space ) long - wavelength modes , and slower later , as the energy is partitioned with the short - wavelength modes . although we have adopted the language of nonequilibrium field theory , we remark that one could equally well treat the system as a microcanonical ensemble with fixed energy @xmath89 .",
    "we showed that , for a range of initial temperatures , the initial stages of the dynamics are dominated by damped oscillations of the field s zero mode , which , via parametric resonance , excite the modes associated with coherent structures named oscillons .",
    "we also showed that the initial emergence of oscillons occurs at the breakdown of the homogeneous hartree approximation .",
    "furthermore , this emergence occurs in synchrony , characterizing a global emergence phenomenon .",
    "as oscillons are long - lived coherent structures , they act as bottlenecks for equipartition .",
    "the observed synchronous emergence dies away with the damping of the zero - mode oscillations .",
    "oscillons then appear randomly throughout the lattice , until such a time when there is nt enough energy in long - wavelength modes .",
    "we then investigated the dynamics in adws , where the final equilibrium state is at the global minimum of the potential .",
    "the system was thermalized as for the sdw , in its metastable well .",
    "also as before , the quenching induces damped oscillations of the field s zero mode and oscillons emerge .",
    "we observed that , approximately for the same range of temperatures where oscillons emerged in the sdw case , the decay rate was greatly enhanced , when compared to homogeneous nucleation results .",
    "in fact , we obtained an excellent fit to a _ power law decay _",
    "time scale , @xmath303^b$ ] , where @xmath261 is the energy of the critical nucleus or bounce and @xmath1 is a numerical exponent , @xmath304 , for the temperatures we investigated .",
    "we argued that there were two main mechanisms for what we called resonant nucleation : for small asymmetries , the critical nucleus appears as two or more oscillons coalesce . for larger asymmetries",
    ", a single oscillon grows to become the critical nucleus , promoting the decay of the metastable state .",
    "the greatly accelerated decay is due to the resonant oscillations of the zero mode , induced by the quenching .",
    "it is thus plausible that such behavior may be observed in several related systems with a scalar order parameter .",
    "the emergence of oscillons in granular materials appears due to the sinusoidal vibrations of their container @xcite ; this is mimicked here by the oscillation of the field s zero mode , which corresponds to the periodic oscillation of the whole lattice . as for granular materials ,",
    "patterns emerge above a certain amplitude .",
    "we do not claim to have modelled the behavior of granular materials here , but believe to have captured some of the essential physics .",
    "also , since the model here falls in the ising universality class , we expect that similar qualitative behavior should occur , for example , in ferromagnets and possibly binary liquids and metal alloys , if long wavelength oscillations can be induced by the quenching process .",
