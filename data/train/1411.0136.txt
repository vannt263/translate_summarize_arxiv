    "the equation of state ( eos ) of highly neutron - rich matter is important for understanding wide ranging questions in contemporary nuclear structure physics , from the structure of rare isotopes ( e.g. , the thickness of neutron skins ) to the properties of neutron stars .",
    "a quantity of central importance in many of these phenomena is the density - dependent nuclear symmetry energy , arising as the difference between the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter at a given density .    in astrophysical contexts ,",
    "the eos of neutron - rich matter is required over many orders of magnitude in the nuclear density , potentially up to ten times that of saturated nuclear matter . in principle , both one - boson - exchange as well as dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculations can access the high - density regime of the eos .",
    "however , boson - exchange models ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) typically employ three - nucleon forces ( 3nfs ) with little connection to the associated nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) force .",
    "for instance , large 3nf contributions arise from @xmath5-isobar intermediate states , whereas explicit @xmath5 isobars are missing from the @xmath4 part .",
    "relativistic approaches to the nuclear matter problem have been centered around the dbhf scheme @xcite .",
    "the main strength of this framework is in its ability to account for an important class of 3nfs , namely virtual nucleon - antinucleon excitations , that lead to nuclear matter saturation close to the empirical density and energy @xcite .",
    "nowadays , microscopic nuclear many - body theory typically starts from the low - energy realization of qcd , chiral effective field theory @xcite , and fits unresolved nuclear dynamics at short distances to the properties of two- and few - nucleon systems alone .",
    "the resulting potentials are then used to make predictions in nuclear many - body systems .",
    "the chiral effective field theory approach to nuclear and neutron matter has succeeded in producing realistic equations of state only with the inclusion of repulsive 3nfs arising at order n@xmath0lo ( next - to - next - to - leading order ) in the chiral power counting @xcite . in chiral effective field theory , the dominant two - pion - exchange component of this 3nf , with associated @xmath6 low - energy constants ,",
    "is constructed consistently with the n@xmath0lo two - body force .",
    "many - body perturbation theory with low - momentum chiral nuclear forces @xcite has been shown to reproduce qualitatively the saturation behavior found with renormalization - group - evolved two - body forces with refit low - energy constants in the 3nf sector @xcite .",
    "however , all low - momentum interactions are limited in calculations of the eos to densities where the characteristic momentum scale ( on the order of the fermi momentum ) is below the scale set by the momentum - space cutoff @xmath7 in the @xmath4 potential regulating function , which for chiral @xmath4 forces typically has the form : @xmath8 \\ ; , \\label{reg}\\ ] ] where @xmath9mev is associated with the onset of favorable perturbative properties .",
    "nonperturbative methods for computing the eos with chiral nuclear forces are under active investigation @xcite and may allow for higher values of the cutoff @xmath7 ( but still remaining below the chiral breakdown scale of about 1 gev ) . furthermore ,",
    "concerning the range of densities which can be reliably accessed , we note that the fermi momentum must be lower than the cutoff scale , regardless of the nature ( perturbative or nonperturbative ) of the many - body calculations .",
    "although designed to reproduce similar @xmath4 scattering phase shifts , @xmath4 potentials with different regulator functions will yield different predictions in the nuclear many - body problem due to their different off - shell behavior . on the other hand , appropriate re - adjustment of the low - energy constants that appear in the nuclear many - body forces",
    "is expected to reduce the dependence on the regulator function @xcite .",
    "estimates of theoretical uncertainties @xcite for calculations of the equation of state have largely focused on varying the low - energy constants and resolution scale at which nuclear dynamics are probed @xcite . in the present work we lay the foundation for order - by - order calculations of nuclear many - body systems by presenting consistent nlo and n@xmath0lo chiral nuclear forces whose relevant short - range three - body forces are fit to @xmath10 binding energies and the lifetime of the triton .",
    "we then assess the accuracy with which infinite nuclear matter properties and the isospin asymmetry energy can be predicted from order - by - order calculations in chiral effective field theory . identifying",
    "the dominant sources of uncertainty in nuclear many - body calculations is an important open problem , especially as more stringent constraints on the eos of neutron - rich matter and its density dependence are becoming available @xcite . in computing the eos , we employ the nonperturbative particle - particle ladder approximation , which re - sums an important class of diagrams accounting for pauli - blocking in the medium",

    "the next set of diagrams is comprised of the three hole - line contributions , which includes the third - order particle - hole ( ph ) diagram considered in ref .",
    "the third - order hole - hole ( hh ) diagram ( fourth order in the hole - line expansion ) was found to give a negligible contribution to the energy per particle at normal density irrespective of the cutoff ( see table ii and table iii of ref .",
    "the ph diagram is relatively much larger , bringing in an uncertainty of about @xmath201 mev ( accounting for cutoff dependence @xmath21mev ) on the potential energy per particle at normal density .",

    "@xcite , and grows to 1.5 mev at the highest fermi momentum included in the study .",
    "note that these calculations adopt the n@xmath3lo potential ( with @xmath7=500 mev ) and only two - nucleon forces . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite coupled - cluster calculations in nucleonic matter were performed at n@xmath0lo with two- and three - body forces and with the inclusion of selected triples clusters , namely correlations beyond pp and hh ladders .",
    "the effect of these contributions is found to be negligible in neutron matter and about 1 mev per nucleon in symmetric matter in the density range under consideration  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in earlier studies @xcite with meson - theoretic interactions ( with larger momentum - space cutoffs ) that when additional three hole - line contributions are taken into account , large cancellations occur which result in a small net effect on the energy per particle .",
    "this is especially the case when the continuous choice is adopted for the auxiliary potential  @xcite . in summary , we conclude that a realistic estimate of the impact of using a nonperturbative approach beyond pp correlations is about @xmath201 mev in nuclear matter around saturation density and much smaller in neutron matter . as we show below , such uncertainties are significantly smaller than those associated with variations in the cutoff scale .",
    "our results for the energy per particle as a function of the nuclear density are shown in fig .",
    "[ snm ] for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we note that the particle - particle ladder approximation employed in the present work is in good agreement with the perturbative results available at n@xmath3lo from ref .",

    "[ snm ] , the shaded bands in yellow and red represent the spread of our complete calculations conducted at nlo and n@xmath0lo , respectively .",
    "the blue band is the result of a calculation that employs n@xmath3lo @xmath4 potentials together with n@xmath0lo 3nfs . in all cases shown ,",
    "the cutoff is varied over the range 450 - 600 mev . as noted before , the n@xmath3lo 3nfs and",
    "4nfs are at present omitted , and the resulting convergence pattern gives an estimate on the theoretical uncertainty of the calculation ( and not of the chiral effective field theory expansion per se ) . on the right - hand side of the figure , the individual curves corresponding to each order and cutoff are displayed .",
    "we observe that at nlo the potentials constructed at lower cutoff scales do not exhibit saturation until very high densities .",
    "on the other hand , for the 600 mev cutoff potential the @xmath22 partial wave ( together with the @xmath23 partial wave ) is sufficiently repulsive to enable saturation at a relatively smaller density .",
    "we observe that the convergence pattern for the low - cutoff ( @xmath24mev ) potentials is significantly better than for the 600 mev potential .",
    "overall there is a large spread from cutoff variations both at nlo and n@xmath0lo beyond nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "moreover , the bands at these two orders do not overlap , suggesting that their width is not a suitable representation of the uncertainty .",
    "although the ( incomplete ) n@xmath3lo calculation reveals a strong reduction of the cutoff dependence , it is important to notice that an uncertainty of about 8 mev remains at saturation density .",
    "while we do not expect much of a change in nuclear matter predictions from 4nfs @xcite , it is quite possible that the inclusion of n@xmath3lo 3nfs might reduce either the cutoff dependence or improve the convergence pattern .",
    "this will be an interesting subject for future investigations .",
    "the results for neutron matter are presented in fig .",
    "[ nm ] , where the left and right panels have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "note that the range of densities under consideration is smaller for neutron matter in order to keep the fermi momentum below the cutoff in all cases .",
    "we see a large spread at nlo for the largest densities considered , whereas the band has only moderate size at the next order and remains small for our n@xmath3lo calculation .",
    "similar to what was observed in symmetric nuclear matter , the bands at nlo and n@xmath0lo do not overlap in neutron matter .",
    "in addition the n@xmath3lo band does not generally overlap with the n@xmath0lo band .",
    "therefore , the variation obtained by changing the cutoff does not seem to provide a reliable representation of the uncertainty at the given order .",
    "a better way to estimate such uncertainty is to consider the difference between the predictions at two consecutive orders .    in fig .",
    "[ esym ] we present the results for the symmetry energy @xmath25 , which is defined as the strength of the quadratic term in an expansion of the energy per particle in asymmetric matter with respect to the asymmetry parameter @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy per particle and @xmath29 .",
    "the nearly linear behavior of @xmath30 with @xmath31 has been confirmed by many microscopic calculations ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently refs .",
    "it justifies the common approximation of neglecting powers beyond @xmath31 in the expansion above and thus defining the symmetry energy as the difference between the energy per particle in neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "it is well known that @xmath25 enters crucially in discussions of nuclear stability , and its density dependence around normal density strongly correlates with the neutron skin thickness of nuclei and the radius of ( low - mass ) neutron stars . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , systematic efforts are ongoing to set better empirical constraints on the symmetry energy , through both laboratory and astrophysical measurements .",
    "it is therefore important to have an understanding of the theoretical uncertainty affecting calculations of this quantity .",
    "the spread due to the change of the cutoff values in our nlo , n@xmath0lo , and n@xmath3lo calculations is represented by the three bands as before . as observed previously for symmetric matter , the spread due to cutoff variations remains large at n@xmath0lo , with some minimal overlap with the nlo band .",
    "the n@xmath3lo band reflects the large cutoff sensitivity previously observed in symmetric matter .",
    "again , we conclude that the spread generated by changing the cutoff does not in general provide a reliable estimate of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we close this section with some information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy , as revealed by the @xmath32 parameter , @xmath33 namely , the @xmath32 parameter reflects the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation density @xmath34 .",
    "our n@xmath3lo result can be summarized as @xmath35 mev , whereas at n@xmath0lo we find @xmath36 mev .",
    "we do not report a corresponding value at nlo , since , at that order , only the @xmath7=600 mev case show some ( late ) saturating behavior .",
    "constraints on @xmath32 are not yet stringent , and can be quoted as @xmath37 mev @xcite .    .",

    "we have reported predictions for the energy per particle in symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter , focusing on uncertainties related to order - by - order convergence . compared to the consistent nlo and n@xmath0lo results for the equations of state , which themselves exhibit relatively little overlap even for a large spread of momentum - space cutoffs @xmath38mev , the results from employing n@xmath3lo two - nucleon and n@xmath0lo three - nucleon forces imply non - negligible uncertainties associated with missing higher - order terms in the chiral expansion .",
    "we find that the uncertainty associated with the cutoff variation is generally larger in symmetric nuclear matter than in pure neutron matter , but in the latter case we find that the results from one chiral order to the next have little overlap .",
