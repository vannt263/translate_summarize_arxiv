    "after the discovery of graphene and carbon fullerene based nano structures , the molecular clusters having cage - like as well as planar geometries have attracted much attention for constructing novel high - tech nano - materials .",
    "the special interest in such kind of structures , arises due to their unique electronic , optical , mechanical and chemical properties .",
    "therefore , understanding of the mechanisms for their formation , has received immense interest during the last few decades . for the carbon - based nanomaterials",
    ", it is understood that the planar structure of the graphene sheet , is stabilized mainly by the @xmath4 hybridization of the neighboring carbon atoms , while the spherical curvature of the cage - like structure of the carbon fullerene , produces an extra angular strain that allows a mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 hybridizations for bondings among the carbon atoms.@xcitesuch fullerene - like or graphene - like structures have also been synthesized recently using nanoparticles of transition metal ( tm ) oxides or tm dichalcogenide compounds.@xcite note that bulk tm oxides have already been studied extensively because of their wide range of applications from catalysis , organometallic , surface science to high temperature superconductivity , magnetic materials and so on .",
    "furthermore , the tm oxides and chalcogenides being of semiconducting type in general , also lead to some obvious applications in sensors , electronics and solar cells .",
    "nano structuring of these systems induces , in addition , an extreme sensitivity of their properties to the atomic arrangements and shapes of the systems due to quantum confinement effects of the structure .",
    "one of the most interesting facts about these nano clusters is that they exist in various substoichioetric compositions differing from their bulk behavior,@xcite which renders them many unusual properties .",
    "moreover , several oxide nano clusters exhibit some _ magic _ sizes and compositions which correspond to unusually high stability.@xcite due to the presence of @xmath2-electrons , the tm oxide clusters also show interesting magnetic properties . as for example , structural isomers of the oxide clusters possessing the same size and composition , are often found to have a rather different magnetic behavior.@xcite    with a thrust of gaining an atomistic understanding about the reactive properties in heterogeneous catalysis , many tm oxide nano clusters , in neutral or ionic forms , have recently been studied in gas phase by molecular beam experiments in combination with mass spectrometry analysis.@xcite such studies , indeed provide useful insights into the relationship between the geometric structures and the observed reactivity patterns . in the present study , our focus will be on the small nano clusters of the oxides and sulphides of 3@xmath2 late tm atoms .",
    "each 3@xmath2 late tm atom is associated with a more than half - filled @xmath2-orbital .",
    "therefore , both the hybridizations between the @xmath6-orbital of the metal atoms with the @xmath7 ( @xmath8)-orbital of the oxygen ( sulfur ) atoms in the corresponding oxide ( sulphide ) structure , and that between the valence 3@xmath2 and 4@xmath1 orbitals within the metal atoms itself , are expected to play an important role in deciding their many properties . while the nano clusters of tm oxides have been studied widely by both the experimental and theoretical works,@xcite the tm sulphide nano clusters have so far attracted less attention .",
    "it is interesting to follow - up that several molecular beam experiments on the isolated m@xmath9o@xmath10 oxide clusters of the 3@xmath2 late transition metal m atoms indicate a preference for the m : o ratio as 1:1 particularly in case of the smaller cluster sizes.@xciteattempts of searching for the structures of the smallest building blocks in the structures of such oxide nano particles , have also been offered recently by some first principles theoretical calculations.@xcite we will concentrate here on the structure , electronic and magnetic properties of the isolated and isoatomic m@xmath0o@xmath0/m@xmath0s@xmath0 molecular building blocks with the metal atom m corresponding to one of the 3@xmath2 late transition metal atoms _ i.e. _ mn , fe , co , ni or cu .",
    "note that ring - shaped planar structures as well as cage - shaped structures have been predicted widely as the two competing stable isomers for the small clusters of most of the tm oxides.@xcite our aim , in this work , will be , therefore , to perform a rigorous relative structural stability analysis of each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster between the two commonly found geometrical blocks , namely a 2d rhombus - like planar structure versus a 3d cubane - like structure .",
    "the special interest in these two structures , is mainly motivated by their relevance to multi - electron transfer centers in biological systems,@xcite their interesting magnetic and optical properties,@xcite as well as to their potential relevance to inorganic solids.@xcite many poly - nuclear complexes containing cubane - type m@xmath0o@xmath0/m@xmath0s@xmath0 core units , have been studied extensively during the last decade . for examples ,",
    "cubane - type fe@xmath0s@xmath0 units exist in bacterial proteins and play a variety of important roles in crucial cellular processes such as protein bio - synthesis and dna replication.@xcite catalytic activity by the cubane - type oxide clusters has also been explored in photo - system ii for bio - inspired water splitting process.@xcite interestingly , for understanding the catalytic mechanism in these systems , a ligand mediated @xmath11 structural rearrangement of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 molecular units , has recently been predicted as a crucial mechanism.@xcite furthermore , the cubane structure allows a significant magnetic exchange between metal ions and therefore , the cubanes containing manganese atoms , in particular , have been studied extensively for their magnetic properties , specially in the search for single molecular magnets.@xcite on the other hand , planar structure of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 units usually constitute building blocks for the structures of several layered perovskite oxides as well as cubic perovskite oxides , which have been studied extensively in recent time particularly for searching novel photo - catalysts of hydrogen production from water using the sun light.@xcite    in the present work using first principles density functional theory ( dft ) based electronic structure calculations , we have performed a relative structural stability of the isolated m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters between the two morphologies , as a first step towards understanding distinctly their role and the effects of the surrounding environment in the real systems of poly - nuclear transition metal complexes .",
    "note that several m@xmath9o@xmath10 nano clusters have been studied in recent time for various metal m elements with varying @xmath12:@xmath13 ratios.@xcite despite of the great progress achieved in this direction , a systematic study for the understanding of the general trends in structure , stability behavior and electronic properties among the oxide nano clusters of the whole 3@xmath2 late transition metal elements , is still lacking .",
    "our aim here is to find out the trend in the relative structural stability along the oxide as well as sulphide nano clusters of all the 3@xmath2 late tm elements and obtain a better atomistic understanding about it .",
    "the hybridization of the valence orbitals of the constituent atoms has been quantified here in terms of a hybridization index parameter .",
    "interestingly , our study here prevails that the relative stability of the isolated m@xmath0x@xmath0 systems between the two morphologies has been assessed basically by the predominance of either of these hybridization indexes .",
    "present study reveals that the preference of the cubane - like 3d structures for the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters is governed by the dominant effect of the enhanced @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization in this type of structure , while the effect of the enhanced @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization plays the main role for the higher relative stability of the planar structure in case of the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters .",
    "we discuss our results of this study in the following in various sections .",
    "first , the computational details followed in this work , have been summarized in the section [ methodology ] .",
    "the optimized structures , stability and electronic properties , have been discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion in section [ concd ] .",
    "the calculations reported in this study , were performed using dft within the framework of pseudo potential plane wave method , as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite we used the projected augmented wave ( paw ) pseudo potential @xcite coupled with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange correlation energy functional as formulated by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite the 3@xmath2 as well as 4@xmath1 electrons for the tm metal atoms , the 2@xmath1 ( 3@xmath1 ) as well as 2@xmath3 ( 3@xmath3 ) electrons for the nonmetal oxygen ( sulfur ) atoms , were treated as the valence electrons . as the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters contain not only the metal atoms , but also the light nonmetal atoms , long range dispersion interactions could eventually be important and thus modifying the structures or the relative stability . to improve our description of the electronic properties of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters",
    ", we also included the van der waals interactions .",
    "we employed the empirical approach proposed by grimme ( dft+d2),@xcite which describes the van der waals interactions via a simple pair - wise force field .",
    "it has a lower computational cost and has currently been employed in the vasp code . in the dft+d2 approach ,",
    "the total energy , e@xmath14 is obtained by the sum of the conventional kohn - sham dft energy ( e@xmath15 ) with the van der waals dispersion correction ( e@xmath16 ) , _",
    "i.e _    @xmath17    where @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 run over the atoms in the unit cell .",
    "c@xmath21 represents the dispersion coefficient for the atom pair ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) , @xmath22 is a global scaling factor that depends solely on the exchange - correlation functional ( @xmath22=0.75 for pbe ) , r@xmath23 is the distance between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 atoms and @xmath24(r@xmath23 ) is a damped parameter employed in the dft+d2 framework , as discussed in the ref .",
    "the wave functions were expanded in the plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off of 400 ev in all pbe and pbe+d2 calculations .",
    "the convergence of the energies with respect to the cut - off value were checked . for the cluster calculations ,",
    "a simple cubic super - cell was used with periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters were kept separated by around 16  vacuum space , which essentially makes the interaction between the cluster images negligible .",
    "geometry optimizations were performed during the self - consistent calculations under the approximation of _ collinear _ magnetic orderings using the conjugate gradient and the quasi - newtonian methods .",
    "the process of atomic relaxation was repeated until all the force components were less than a threshold value of 0.001 ev /  as well as the total energy difference of two consecutive relaxation steps was less than 10@xmath25 ev .",
    "reciprocal space integrations of the super - cell , were carried out at the @xmath26 point .",
    "the binding energy , e@xmath27 of the optimal structures for each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster , is calculated with respect to the free atoms , as @xmath28 where e(m@xmath0x@xmath0 ) is the total energy of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster , while e(m ) is the total energy of an isolated m atom . with this formula ,",
    "e@xmath27 is a + ve quantity and its more + ve value indicates higher stability .",
    "theoretical investigations of the relative structural stability using dft calculations , first requires the determination of the most stable structures of the two geometries and the stabler one between them , is considered as the minimum energy structure ( mes ) out of the two geometries for each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster . for the nano clusters of tm oxides , the determination of the mes needs an exhaustive search down the potential energy surface ( pes ) as isomers of different magnetic characters are often found to lie in close energy separation and thereby , makes the task of determining the mes a cumbersome one . the primary structural patterns of the two most probable geometries for each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster , are shown in fig . [ structure ] .",
    "we have first taken these two geometries as the initial guessed structures for each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster and allowed them to relax for all possible spin configurations using _ collinear _ spin - polarized calculations . instead of the global optimization , we allow the two structures to relax locally so that each structure undergoes for bond optimization only , while retaining their original shape .",
    "therefore , the geometry relaxation for each system , has been done for all possible ferromagnetic ( fm ) as well as anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations among the metal atoms of the 2d as well as 3d structures , also illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ structure ] . for the afm couplings among the tm atoms ,",
    "note that we have considered two spin configurations for each of the 2d and 3d structures .",
    "for an ideal cube , the two afm configurations of the 3d cubane structure , appear identical .",
    "consideration of distortion in the structure can , however , result different isomers .",
    "so , there are roughly total six possible isomer / spin state combinations for each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster . even for the fm configuration , each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster of both the ring and cage - shaped structures ,",
    "were allowed to relax for all possible spin multiplicities to ensure the occurrence of intermediate spin state , if any , as the mes .",
    "after determining the optimized geometries , we have performed a comprehensive analysis on their relative stability as well as structural , magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "the results of our dft+d2 calculations have been discussed here . however , a comparison of the results of relative stability and magnetic coupling of the optimal 2d and 3d structures by the dft+d2 as well as dft without van der waals correction , has been discussed later in this section .",
    "table [ tab : bemag ] shows the the details about the relative energies , metal - nonmetal nearest neighbor ( nn ) average bond lengths and total as well as average atom - centered magnetic moments of the most stable fm and afm configurations for both the ring - shaped 2d as well as cubane - shaped 3d structures .",
    "the relative energy has been calculated with respective to the energy of the mes and its @xmath29ve values indicate that the corresponding isomers are higher in energy . to characterize the optimal structures , we have studied the average of the m@xmath30x nn bond lengths for each system .",
    "the average of the m@xmath30x bond lengths has been calculated on eight m@xmath30x nn bond lengths in case of the optimal 2d structures and twelve m@xmath30x nn bond lengths in case of the optimal 3d structures .",
    "the atom - centered magnetic moments have been calculated using the mulliken population analysis of spin.@xcite first focusing on the relative stability of the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , it is seen from the table [ tab : bemag ] that the mes of each m@xmath0o@xmath0 cluster has the 2d ring - shaped structure .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 2d ring - shaped structures for the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , are more stable than the respective most optimized 3d counterparts by an energy amount of 1.30 ev , 1.58 ev , 1.96 ev , 1.97 ev and 2.80 ev for m = mn , fe , co , ni and cu respectively .",
    "our calculations show that the mes of each m@xmath0o@xmath0 cluster , has afm magnetic coupling for m = mn , fe , co , cu and an intermediate fm coupling with total magnetic moment of 4 @xmath31 for the mes of the ni@xmath0o@xmath0 cluster .",
    "also note that the most optimized 3d cubane structures have the afm coupling for the mn@xmath0o@xmath0 , fe@xmath0o@xmath0 , ni@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , while the magnetic coupling is fm for the most stable 3d cubane structures of the co@xmath0o@xmath0 and cu@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters with total magnetic moments of 12 @xmath31 and 4 @xmath31 respectively .",
    "it is important to mention that our predictions of 2d ring - shaped geometry as the ground state structure for the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters and their preference for the afm magnetic configuration , are mostly in accordance with the previous theoretical results.@xcite moreover , the presence of the oxygen atoms as a part in the mes of each m@xmath0o@xmath0 cluster , also plays significant role in deciding its structure and electronic properties , as the mes of the pure m@xmath0 clusters would adopt a tetrahedron - like 3d structure for each of m = mn , fe , co as well as ni and favor a fm coupling with total magnetic moment of 20 @xmath31,@xcite 12 @xmath31,@xcite 10 @xmath31@xcite and 4 @xmath31@xcite respectively .",
    "however , a pure cu@xmath0 cluster is found to stabilize in planar structure with zero net magnetic moment.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to understand the stability behavior , we have studied the trend in the homo - lumo spin - gaps for the optimal 2d and 3d structures for all the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the systems being magnetic , we have calculated two spin gaps - @xmath32 and @xmath33 as defined in our earlier work.@xcite our calculated values of the spin gaps are also plotted in the fig .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 values are positive for all the systems .",
    "moreover , the 2d structures of the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters and 3d structures of the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters , mostly have higher values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which is consistent with the fact of their relatively higher stability . while comparing the overall stability of the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters versus the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters , it is also seen from the fig .",
    "[ gaps ] that the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters have relatively higher binding energies compared to those of the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters for a common m element . in an attempt to understand the relatively lower stability and higher values of the nn bond - lengths for the optimal 3d m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters ,",
    "we have studied the structures and stability of the isolated m - o and m - s dimers . our calculated binding energies and nn bond lengths for the optimal m - o dimers , are ( 5.44 ev , 1.64 ) , ( 5.41 ev , 1.62 ) , ( 5.37 ev , 1.61 ) , ( 5.00 ev , 1.62 ) and ( 3.45 ev , 1.70 ) for m = mn to cu respectively .",
    "the calculated m@xmath30o bond lengths of the dimers which are much smaller than the respective bulk and also that of the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , are in agreement with the experimental results.@xcite the corresponding values of the m - s dimers are ( 3.84 ev , 2.04 ) , ( 4.35 ev , 2.00 ) , ( 4.51 ev , 1.97 ) , ( 4.39 ev , 1.96 ) and ( 3.25 ev , 2.03 ) which indicate that m - s dimers have relatively higher bond - length and less stability compared to the corresponding m - o dimers .",
    "as each of the optimal 2d as well as 3d structures of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters , consists of a number of the m@xmath30x dimers , the same trend in stability between the m@xmath30o and m@xmath30s dimers will also be reflected in the trend of relative stability between the m@xmath0o@xmath0 and m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters .",
    "therefore , the chemistry effect of replacing oxygen atoms by sulfur atoms in going from the m@xmath0o@xmath0 to the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters , plays a significant role in the predicted higher values of the @xmath34m - s@xmath35 bond lengths as seen from the table [ tab : bemag ] and the lower stability for the optimal structures of the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters as seen from the fig .",
    "[ gaps ] .    for better understanding about the trend in the relative structural stability of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters between their 2d and 3d structures , we have studied the spin - polarized @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 orbital projected density of states ( pdos ) summed over all the constituent atoms of the mess of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters as plotted in fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that the @xmath3 and @xmath2 pdos are dominating for both the m@xmath0o@xmath0 and m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters . the contribution of the @xmath1 orbitals , though not significant , spreads over an extended energy ranges for the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , while it is mostly localized to some particular energy intervals in case of the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters .",
    "it therefore , could result relatively larger @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization for the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters compared to that of the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters . to examine the nature of splitting of pdos near the fermi energy , we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ dos ] the homo orbital for the mes of each cluster .",
    "we note that the contributions of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 orbitals of the transition metal atoms for the mess of the 2d - m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters are dominating . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominating @xmath2-sub - orbitals for the transition metal atoms are mostly @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the mess of the 3d - m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters .    finally , in order to quantify the orbital hybridizations , we have calculated @xmath1-@xmath2 as well as @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization indexes for the most stable 2d and 3d structures of each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster .",
    "a hybridization index for a m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster is generally defined by using the formula , @xmath40 ; where @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to the orbital indices - @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the projection of @xmath19-th kohn - sham orbital onto the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) spherical harmonic centered at atom @xmath45 , integrated over a sphere of specified radius .",
    "note that the spin index is implicit in the summation .",
    "the role of such hybridization index for determining cluster morphology has been addressed previously.@xcite as the valance 4@xmath1 and 3@xmath2 orbitals of the metal atoms and the valence 2@xmath1/2@xmath3 ( 3@xmath1/3@xmath3 ) orbitals of the nonmetal oxygen ( sulfur ) atoms mainly participate in the hybridization , we have calculated both the @xmath1-@xmath2 as well as @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization indexes .",
    "it is also important to mention at this point that these two hybridization indexes have counter effects with respect to controlling the stability behavior .",
    "this is in the sense that the overlap of the transition metal atom @xmath2-orbitals ( specially the @xmath36 , @xmath37 orbitals ) with its @xmath1 orbitals in case of the systems with enhanced @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization , confines mostly in the xy - plane and this would favor stabilization in a planar morphology .",
    "on the other hand , enhanced @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization would involve hybridization of the nonmetal atom x-@xmath3 orbitals with the @xmath2 orbitals of the metal m atoms in all the three directions / planes and thereby , prones to favor a 3d geometry .",
    "[ stability ] shows the plots of our calculated hybridization indexes for the most optimized 2d as well as 3d structures of all the m@xmath0o@xmath0 and m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters .",
    "it is seen that irrespective of the 2d and 3d geometries , the @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization index is larger than the @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization index for both the optimal structures of each m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster because of the significant overlapping of the valence @xmath3 orbital of x atoms with the valence @xmath2 orbital of the transition metal m atoms .",
    "focusing on the relative magnitudes of the either hybridization index between the optimized 2d and 3d structures in the fig .",
    "[ stability ] , we note that the @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization index is higher for the optimized 3d structures compared to that of their 2d counterparts .",
    "conversely , the @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization index is always higher for the optimized 2d structures than that of their 3d counterparts",
    ". therefore , though the overall variation in the magnitudes of the @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization indexes , follows the same trend between the optimal 2d and 3d structures for each system in either of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 series , it is their relative influences which come into play in determining the most stable structure . combining the trends in the variation of stability as well as that of the hybridization indexes , it is , therefore , clearly indicating that the predicted stability behavior for both classes of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 cluster series , results microscopically from a delicate balance between the two types of the orbital hybridization . for the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , the enhanced @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization in favor of 2d structures , wins over the enhanced @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization in favor of the 3d structures and overall",
    "stabilizes the 2d structures .",
    "contrary to the case of m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters , the effects of the enhanced @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization in case of the optimized 2d structure of the m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters is not significant as can be seen from their values in the fig",
    ". [ stability ] compared to those of the m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters . as a result , it is not able to overcome the influence of its enhanced @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization .",

    "<S> spin - polarized dft has been used to perform a comparative study of the geometric structures and electronic properties for isolated m@xmath0x@xmath0 nano clusters between their two stable isomers - a planar rhombus - like 2d structure and a cubane - like 3d structure with m = mn , fe , co , ni , cu ; x = o , s. these two structural patterns of the m@xmath0x@xmath0 clusters are commonly found as building blocks in several poly - nuclear transition metal complexes in inorganic chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the van der waals corrections to the physical properties have been considered in the electronic structure calculations employing the empirical grimme s correction ( dft+d2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report here an interesting trend in their relative structural stability - the isolated m@xmath0o@xmath0 clusters prefer to stabilize more in the planar structure , while the cubane - like 3d structure is more favorable for most of the isolated m@xmath0s@xmath0 clusters than their planar 2d counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals that this contrasting trend in the relative structural stability is expected to be driven by an interesting interplay between the @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath3-@xmath2 hybridization effects of the constituents valence electrons . </S>"
