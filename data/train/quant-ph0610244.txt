    "the achievement of producing bose  einstein condenstates with ultracold dilute gases of atoms has seen a wealth of theoretical and experimental activity . one enticing prospect of bose - einstein condensates is that they may allow for a better understanding of the interface between classical and quantum mechnics , through the possibility of macroscopic schrdinger cat states @xcite and macroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite .",
    "another intriguing field of study is the chemistry of bose - einstein condensates , where the atomic constituents may form molecules through feshbach resonances @xcite or photoassociation @xcite . a novel feature of a molecular bose ",
    "einstein condensate is that the atomic and molecular states can exist as a superposition @xcite , providing a chemical analogue of a schrdinger cat state . in cases where the molecules are heteronuclear",
    ", the presence of a permanent electric dipole moment also opens the possibility for manipulating the condensate through electrostatic forces @xcite .",
    "since systems of bose  einstein condensates exist at ultracold temperatures , it is to be expected that significant insights into their behaviour can be obtained from studying their ground - state properties . from a general theoretical perspective",
    "there has been substantial progress in the understanding of quantum ( i.e. ground - state ) phases in many - body quantum systems , due largely to a cross fertilisation of ideas between the condensed matter theory and the quantum information theory communities .",
    "much of this study has explored the relationship between entanglement and quantum criticality @xcite . however",
    "other characterisations of quantum criticality have been sought too @xcite . recently",
    "the notion of wavefunction overlaps ( also known as the _ fidelity _ ) , which is again common in quantum information theory , has been applied to the study of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this approach is its universality , as it can be applied to any system independent of the choice of decomposition into subsystems .    with the above points in mind here we analyse",
    "a simple , yet non - trivial , three - mode model describing a heteronuclear molecular condensate .",
    "two modes are associated with two distinguishable atomic constituents , which can combine to form a molecule represented by the third mode .",
    "besides the interaction describing the interconversion of atoms and molecules , the hamiltonian contains terms which are linear in the mode number operators ( corresponding to external fields ) and terms which are second - order in the mode number operators ( corresponding to scattering interactions between atoms and molecules ) .",
    "we mainly concern ourselves with the ground - state properties of the model , with the aim of identifying the ground - state phases .",
    "we avoid taking the thermodynamic limit and restrict our analysis to finite systems , for reasons which will be discussed later .",
    "this in turn presents challenges in rigourously identifying quantum phases , since for finite systems there are no singularities in physical quantities such as the ground state energy and its derivatives .",
    "however several recent works have addressed the issues of quantum phases in finite systems @xcite .",
    "we mention that traditional techniques of renormalisation group methods are not applicable to the model under consideration , due to the low number of degrees of freedom .",
    "neither is the concept of symmetry breaking , as the model does not admit global symmetries , nor long - range order , as the model is in essence zero - dimensional .",
    "we start our analysis with a semi - classical treatment , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "since the model with which we are dealing is integrable , the semi - classical many - body system can be reduced to a problem with a single degree of freedom .",
    "we study the phase space of this system , in particular determining the fixed points . it is found that for certain coupling parameters bifurcations of the fixed points occur , and we can determine a parameter space diagram which classifies the fixed points .",
    "an unexpected result is that the boundaries between the regions in parameter space are extremely sensitive on whether the number of constituent atoms is equal or not .",
    "specifically , when the number of constituent atoms is equal ( i.e. the _ atomic imbalance _ is zero ) there is a spontaneous appearance of additional boundaries in the parameter space , some of which can be identified with bifurcations of the global minimum of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "we next investigate the extent to which the classical behaviour influences the ground - state properties of the quantum system .",
    "our first goal in the full quantum analysis is to derive an exact bethe ansatz solution for the model .",
    "we use the bethe ansatz solution to map the spectrum of the hamiltonian into that of a one - body schrdinger equation in one - dimensional .",
    "an advantage of this method is that it allows for an analysis of the finite system , following the ideas of @xcite , as the mapping to the one - body schrdinger equation is not dependent on taking the thermodynamic limit of the original many - body system .",
    "the results of the analysis of the associated schrdinger equation are in general agreement with the results obtained from the semi - classical treatment , supporting the picture of an additional phase boundary when the atomic imbalance is zero . however , due to quantum fluctuations , the emergence of the phase boundary is smooth rather than spontaneous .",
    "this property is apparent from a study of ground - state expectation values and quantum dynamics .    in order to simply characterise the ground - state phases for the finite system ,",
    "we finally define the notion of a _ quantum phase pre - transition _ in terms of wavefunction overlaps .",
    "specifically , a quantum phase pre - transition is identified with each coupling for which the incremental ground - state wavefunction overlap is a local minimum .",
    "we numerically calculate these for several cases and discuss these results in relation to the semi - classical and quantum analyses which have been described above .",
    "the results confirm the emergence of a quantum phase boundary in the limit of zero atomic imbalance .",
    "we consider a general three - mode hamiltonian describing a heteronuclear molecular bose ",
    "einstein condensate with two distinct species of atoms , labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which can combine to produce a molecule labelled by @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce canonical creation and annihilation operators @xmath3 satisfying the usual commutation relations @xmath4=i$ ] etc . , which represent the three degrees of freedom in the model .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath5 the parameters @xmath6 describe s - wave scattering , @xmath7 are external potentials and @xmath8 is the amplitude for interconversion of atoms and molecules .",
    "we remark that in the limit @xmath9 , equation ( [ ham ] ) is the hamiltonian studied in @xcite in the context of quantum optics . in the latter stages of the manuscript",
    "we will study this limiting case in some detail .",
    "the hamiltonian acts on the fock space spanned by the ( unnormalised ) vectors @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fock vacuum .",
    "we then have @xmath12 etc .",
    ", where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath16 and the total atom number @xmath17 . we refer to @xmath18 as the atomic imbalance and introduce @xmath19 $ ] as the fractional atomic imbalance .",
    "as there are three degrees of freedom and three conserved operators , the system is integrable .",
    "this fact will allow us to analyse the model in some depth .",
    "below we begin with a semi - classical analogue of the model , and determine the fixed points of the system .",
    "we now regard ( [ ham2 ] ) as a classical hamiltonian and investigate the fixed points of the system .",

    "this property affects the types of solutions for ( [ fixed ] ) . specifically , we now have the following classifications of solutions for @xmath37 :    * @xmath44 , and @xmath26 is a solution of @xmath57 which can admit zero , one or two solutions .",

    "the boundaries in parameter space are depicted in fig .",
    "[ parametro1 ] .    to help visualise the classical dynamics ,",
    "it is useful to plot the level curves of the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) .",

    "assuming the ground state of the system is non - degenerate , let @xmath67 denote the unique normalised ground state .",
    "for fixed small @xmath68 we define the function @xmath69 by @xmath70 which is symmetric in @xmath68 , bounded between 0 and 1 , and satisfies @xmath71 .",

    "[ gsoverlaps1 ] when @xmath76 , representing a coupling change of about @xmath77 on either side of the threshold coupling , the ground states are essentially orthogonal .",
    "however the value of @xmath62 at which the minimum occurs is largely independent of @xmath68 . for a given @xmath68",
    "we say that there is a quantum phase pre - transition at @xmath78 if @xmath72 , treated as a single - variable function of @xmath66 , is locally minimal at @xmath78 .",

    "[ gsoverlaps2 ] ( a ) shows the behaviour of @xmath74 with @xmath79 and varying @xmath29 for both @xmath37 and @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear the minimum value of @xmath74 , which determines the quantum phase pre - transition , is at @xmath81 .",
    "the distinction between the predicted threshold coupling and the observed pre - transition coupling is that the pre - transition coupling also occurs for @xmath36 , although for fixed @xmath29 the value of the minimum is lower for @xmath37 compared to @xmath80 . in all instances the value of the mimimum decreases with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "[ gsoverlaps2 ] ( b ) shows similar results for fixed @xmath73 and varying @xmath82 . in this latter case",

    "we can see that although quantum phase pre - transitions as defined exist for @xmath36 , the distiguishability of the two phases is more reliable in the limit as @xmath32 goes to zero . in the analyses of sect .",
    "[ sca ] and sect .",
    "[ sem ] qualitative differences are only found precisely when @xmath37 .",
    "we interpret these results as the emergence of quantum phase boundaries at @xmath37 .",
    "we have studied the ground - state phases of a three - mode model describing a heteronuclear molecular bose ",
    "einstein condensate , through a variety of techniques . using a semi - classical analysis",
    "we were able to determine threshold couplings associated with fixed point bifurcations in phase space .",
    "we then derived the exact bethe ansatz solution for the system and discussed how the spectrum of the hamiltonian maps into that of an associated one - body schrdinger equation .",
    "it was shown that in the particular subcase of no scattering interactions the threshold coupling for the global minimum in phase space for zero atomic imbalance was consistent with the existence of a bifurcation of the potential of the schrdinger equation .",
    "for the non - zero imbalance case where the semi - classical results do not predict any threshold coupling , it was found that there was no bifurcation of the schrdinger potential .",
    "these results suggested that the ground - state properties of the model are sensitive to whether the atomic imbalance was zero or non - zero .",
    "however due to the finite nature of the system , such a transition is not associated with a discontinuity that is defined in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we then introduced the notion of a quantum phase pre - transition for finite systems , defined in terms of ground - state wavefunction overlaps .",
    "applying this idea to the model under consideration we argued that a quantum phase boundary emerges in the limit as the atomic imbalance goes to zero .    for future work",
    "it would be useful to investigate the ground - state entanglement properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "not only would this be of interest in the study of the behaviour of the entanglement at the quantum phase boundary as @xmath32 approaches zero , but the model is also a simple example of a strictly tripartite system which may offer insights into the role of three - way entanglement in the description of quantum phases .",
