    "in previous papers @xcite , a number of effects produced by superhorizon cosmological vector modes were discussed in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) ; in particular , it was proved that these modes may explain the anomalies in the first multipoles of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature distribution . in gr ,",
    "vector modes decay during the matter dominated era and , consequently , it is not easy to explain their presence at redshifts close to @xmath0 ( matter - radiation decoupling ) ; however , in vector - tensor ( vt ) theories , the evolution of vector modes is expected to be different and , in some cases , this evolution might be appropriate to explain cmb anomalies .",
    "it occurs in the case of the vt theory studied in this paper ; in fact , as it is proved below ( see also @xcite ) , for appropriate small values of the vector field energy density without scalar perturbations , the theory is compatible with current observations and , moreover , superhorizon vector modes grow during the matter dominated era .",
    "it is well known that the so - called _ concordance model _ simultaneously explains most of the current cosmological observations . by this reason",
    ", this cosmological model is considered along the paper as the preferred model in the framework of gr . in the concordance model ,",
    "the universe is quasi - flat and the initial fluctuations have an inflationary origin ; in this situation , scalar perturbations are fully dominant , whereas the effects due to gravitational waves ( vector modes ) are expected to be small ( negligible ) . moreover , scalar perturbations are purely adiabatic , their distribution is gaussian , and the initial power spectrum is similar to a harrison - zeldovich one .",
    "there are a set of observations to be simultaneously explained by a concordance model ; e.g. : ( i ) wmap observations of the cmb anisotropies @xcite , ( ii ) other cmb anisotropy observations involving greater @xmath1-values performed from ground and balloon experiments ; among them we mention acbar @xcite , act @xcite and spt @xcite , ( iii ) high - redshift ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations @xcite , ( iv ) power spectra measurements based on galaxy surveys @xcite , ( v ) detection of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite , ( vi ) measurements of the hubble constant @xcite , and ( vii ) primordial deuterium abundance observations @xcite . in the lambda archive",
    "( wmap seven years data ) , various models including different effect as lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich , and so on are fitted to different sets of observational data including always the proper wmap7 data ; e.g. , for a @xmath2cdm model including lensing and sunyaev - zeldovich effects , the best fitting to wmap7 plus bao and hubble constant measurements corresponds to ( see also @xcite ) : ( 1 ) a reduced hubble constant @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the hubble constant in units of km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ) ; ( 2 ) density parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for the baryonic , dark matter , and vacuum energy , respectively ( the matter density parameter is then @xmath9 ) ; ( 3 ) a total density parameter @xmath10 , ( 4 ) a parameter @xmath11 normalizing the power spectrum of the scalar energy perturbations , ( 5 ) a running scalar spectral index @xmath12 with @xmath13 for @xmath14 , ( 6 ) an equation of state for dark energy of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and ( 7 ) an optical depth @xmath17 which characterizes the reionization .",
    "there are fifty eight different fittings in the lambda archive .",
    "all of them give similar cmb angular power spectra to fit wmap7 data . by this reason ,",
    "results in next sections appear to be almost independent of the particular choice of the fitting parameters , provided that they are close enough to the central values of some lambda fitting .",
    "our choice of these parameters is done in section [ sec-3 ] and , then , the resulting concordance model is assumed along the paper as a model of reference leading to a good fitting with current observations .",
    "predictions from models based on the vt theory under consideration will be compared with observational data",
    ". obviously , only predictions similar enough to those of the reference model may be compatible with current observations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : the vt theory is described in section [ sec-2 ] , predictions of the concordance model are compared with observations in section [ sec-3 ] .",
    "these comparisons are extended to vt cosmology in section [ sec-4 ] .",
    "vector perturbations are studied in section [ sec-5 ] and , finally , section [ sec-6 ] is a general discussion and a summary of the main conclusions .",
    "let us finish this section fixing some notation criteria .",

    "the gravitational constant and the scale factor are denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "units are chosen in such a way that the speed of light is @xmath20 .",
    "in vector - tensor theories , there are two fields , the metric @xmath21 and a four - vector @xmath22 .",
    "various of these theories have been proposed ( see @xcite , @xcite and references cited there ) .",
    "we are interested in one of the theories based on the action @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are arbitrary parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the scalar curvature , the ricci tensor , the determinant of the @xmath21 matrix , and the matter lagrangian , respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath32 stands for the covariant derivative , and @xmath33 . in action ( [",
    "1.1 ] ) , it is implicitly assumed that the coupling between the matter fields and @xmath34 is negligible .",
    "a different action is given in @xcite .",
    "it involves a new term of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a lagrange multiplier . with the help of this term",
    ", the vector @xmath22 is constrained to be timelike with unit norm . from this last action",
    ", the field equations of the so - called einstein - aether constrained theories can be easily obtained .",
    "the applications of these theories to cosmology are discussed , e.g. , in @xcite . a mass term of the form @xmath37 is used by @xcite to explain cosmic acceleration with a massive vector field .",
    "the same acceleration was explained in the framework of the theory studied in this paper by @xcite .",
    "recently , other theories involving vector fields have been also applied to cosmology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    whatever the action parameters may be , only the ppn parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 may be different from those of gr in the theories based on action ( [ 1.1 ] ) . moreover , in these theories there is a varying effective gravitational constant @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) . on account of current solar system observations ,",
    "we are only interested in theories having @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this condition is hereafter our ppn viability condition . for @xmath45 , there are only two theories compatible with the ppn viability condition , the first ( second ) of these theories corresponds to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . in the second case , we have verified that vector cosmological modes evolve as in gr ; hence , on account of our motivations ( see section [ sec-1 ] ) , we are not interested in this theory but in a theory with @xmath46 . from the ppn parameters given in @xcite , it is easily seen that any theory with the action parameters @xmath48 , arbitrary @xmath25 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is compatible with the ppn viability condition .",
    "finally , the same occurs for @xmath51 , arbitrary @xmath52 and @xmath49 and also for @xmath51 , arbitrary @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "although all these theories deserve attention , their study is out of the scope of this paper . here",
    ", we only analyze the theory with @xmath54 and @xmath45 , whose field equations were given in @xcite .",
    "various reasons have motivated the choice of this theory : ( 1 ) it is the simplest theory compatible with the ppn viability condition , ( 2 ) it does not involve new dimensional constants , ( 3 ) it has been already studied in various papers @xcite , where it was proved that in this theory there are no classical and quantum instabilities , and also that the so - called cosmic coincidence problem is avoided , and ( 4 ) deeper study is necessary to support its reliability .",
    "scalar and vector @xmath55-perturbations of cosmological interest should arise inside the effective horizon during inflation ; nevertheless , the vt theory does not define the inflationary period , which is likely produced by some scalar field . the coupling between this scalar inflaton and the vector field @xmath55 is basic to estimate the initial inflationary @xmath55-perturbations .",
    "this coupling is to be chosen among many possibilities . after reheating ,",
    "the scalar perturbations evolve coupled to the remaining scalar modes ( associated to the metric , the energy densities , and so on ) and their evolution is very complicated .",
    "a code similar to camb , but including the new scalar @xmath22-modes , would be necessary .",
    "this study and the full analysis of possible inflationary models is beyond the scope of this paper . on account of these facts ,",
    "we first complete the study of the selected vt theory in the case of negligible @xmath55-perturbations ( see previous papers by @xcite and @xcite ) and , afterwards , we study the evolution of possible vector perturbations after reheating .",
    "encouraging results from this study ( see sections [ sec-5 ] and [ sec-6 ] ) suggest future work ( see section [ sec-6 ] ) in the framework of both the chosen vt theory and other vt theories compatible with the ppn viability condition .    from the field equations @xcite",

    "this fluid contains baryons , radiation , and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "we see that the field equations of the theory couple the variables @xmath71 and @xmath19 describing the background .",
    "the density parameters due to baryons , radiation , cdm , the vector field and the curvature term are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively .",

    "one has @xmath78 and @xmath79 , whereas in the closed ( open ) case the curvature density parameter is negative ( positive ) and the inequality @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) is satisfied .",
    "the free parameters of the theory are assumed to be the hubble constant and the density parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in the flat case , the present value of the scale factor , @xmath84 , is arbitrary ( we assume @xmath85 ) ; whereas in nonflat models this value is @xmath86 . for a given choice of the free parameters , eqs .",

    "we can then state that , in the absence of @xmath55-perturbations , the vt theory is cosmologically equivalent to gr plus dark energy with the computed @xmath90 ratio .",
    "this variable @xmath91 may be easily used for numerical calculations with camb code @xcite .",
    "this code allows us to calculate all the cosmological spectra , including those associated to the cmb polarization .",
    "all these spectra are influenced by the vector field of the vt theory .",
    "the effects of the vector field would be identical to those produced , in gr , by dark energy with the associated equation of state ( @xmath91 ratio computed in the vt theory ) .",

    "the contents of this section are used along the paper to discuss the viability of the vector - tensor theory under consideration . any admissible theory",

    "these conclusions strongly suggest that the vt theory under consideration does not work in the absence of perturbations .",
    "the study of the matter power spectrum also suggest that , in the absence of perturbations , the vt theory must be rejected . in fact , for the best fittings of the cmb angular power spectrum , the matter power spectrum is not admissible for linear scales with @xmath219 ( see the right panels of fig . [ figu10 ] ) ; however , observations on these scales are very well explained by the concordance model without any bias between baryonic and dark matter ( see fig .",
    "[ figu3 ] ) .    according to the above comments",
    ", the vt theory appears to be inadmissible for any pair ( @xmath107,@xmath104 ) lying in the region represented in fig .",
    "[ figu6 ] , provided that the energy of the vector field @xmath22 plays the role of the dark energy , there is no either vacuum energy or quintessence , and @xmath22-perturbations are negligible .",
    "typical values of @xmath282 may be seen in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "a field whose contribution to the background energy density of the universe is negligible does not significantly affect the background expansion and , consequently , it does not contribute to the sne ia dimming .",
    "however , the fluctuations of this field may produce crucial effects , for example , anisotropies in the cmb , which are fully absent in any homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "these comments strongly suggest that fields being negligible at zero order in cosmology could be fully relevant at higher orders of perturbation theory . at first order , there are scalar , vector , and tensor modes and , if one or more of these perturbation components are not negligible , the field might be detected by the observation of the effects produced by the non - negligible modes on the cmb and the matter power spectrum .",
    "this detection seems to be possible for rather small zero order energy densities @xmath283 .",
    "these arguments and those presented in section [ sec-1 ] about the possible importance of the vt theories in the explanation of the cmb anomalies have motivated the study presented in section [ sec-5 ] on the parameter configuration vt16 of table [ tab : table1 ] , in which we have assumed a small background energy density with density parameter @xmath284 .",
    "thus , if both scalar and vector perturbations associated to @xmath22 are negligible , the small value of @xmath75 in configuration vt16 leads to predictions in agreement with observations ( see section [ sec-5 ] ) .    after studying the vt theory in the absence of @xmath22-perturbations , we have studied the evolution of vector perturbations in configuration vt16 .",
    "this evolution is much simpler than that of the scalar perturbations and , moreover , both evolutions are independent ( in the linear regime ) ; by this reason , we have been able to study the evolution of the @xmath22 vector modes in section [ sec-5 ] .",
    "the main conclusion is that , for superhorizon scales , quantities @xmath268 and @xmath285 grow . for the scale @xmath286 , these quantities increase around @xmath287 orders of magnitude from @xmath288 to present time ; hence , even from small initial superhorizon perturbations , we can have large enough perturbations during the recombination - decoupling process producing anomalies in the small cmb @xmath1-multipoles .",
    "subhorizon scales do not grow at the same rhythm and , furthermore , they oscillate ; hence , only the superhorizon scales would be relevant at recombination - decoupling preventing anomalies for too large @xmath138 values . the contributions of these superhorizon vector modes to the low @xmath1 multipoles must be analyzed by using simulations and methods similar to those used by @xcite .",
    "the scalar @xmath22-perturbations must be estimated in admissible inflationary models likely triggered by appropriate scalar fields coupled or not to field @xmath22 . on account of the results obtained in sections [ sec-4 ] and [ sec-5 ] ,",
    "any inflationary model leading to negligible scalar @xmath22-perturbations must be discarded .",
    "the remaining models might be admissible .",
    "it depends on the effects produced by the @xmath22-perturbations after reheating .",
    "the evolution of the scalar perturbations is to be numerically studied with methods similar to those used in standard cosmology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two are the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "the first one is important since it rules out , for the first time , some versions of the vt theory .",
    "in fact , we have concluded that the vt model studied in previous papers @xcite where the @xmath22-energy density plays the role of the dark energy is not compatible with current observations for negligible @xmath22-perturbations .",
    "this conclusion must be taken into account in order to select inflationary models in the vt - theory .",
    "our second conclusion is that model vt16 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) may explain the presence ( absence ) , at recombination - decoupling , of superhorizon ( subhorizon ) vector modes , which is the key to explain cmb anomalies in the low @xmath1 multipoles according to the scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "it has been verified that there are growing vector modes in flat configurations different from vt16 , which suggest that the existence of this kind of modes is a characteristic of the vt theories based on action ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "these conclusions motivate future investigations in the framework of the vt theory selected in section [ sec-2 ] , and also in other vt theories ."
