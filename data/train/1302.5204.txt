    "the notion of cellular algebra was first introduced by graham and lehrer in @xcite for finite dimensional algebras . roughly speaking ,",
    "a cellular algebra @xmath0 possesses a distinguished basis ( possibly more than one ) , known as a `` cellular basis '' , that is particularly well - adapted to studying the representation theory of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , a cellular basis yields a filtration of @xmath0 with composition factors isomorphic to the cell modules .",
    "further , the structure constants with respect to the cellular basis define bilinear forms on cell modules and one can show that the quotient of a cell module by the radical of this bilinear form is either 0 or irreducible . in this way , one obtains a complete set of isomorphism classes of simple modules for the given cellular algebra .",
    "examples of cellular algebras include many finite - dimensional hecke algebras @xcite .",
    "+ recently , koenig and xi @xcite have generalized this concept to possibly infinite dimensional algebras over a principal ideal domain @xmath1 by introducing the notion of affine cellular algebras . in a cellular algebra , cell modules",
    "are isomorphic to matrix rings with coefficients in @xmath1 and twisted multiplication with respect to the bilinear form . in the affine case , they still are isomorphic to matrix rings with twisted multiplication but the matrix ring is now defined over a quotient of a polynomial ring over @xmath1 . as in the finite dimensional case ,",
    "affine cellular structure for an algebra @xmath0 yields a parametrisation of the irreducible @xmath0-modules .",
    "in their paper , koenig and xi have shown that extended affine hecke algebras of type @xmath0 are affine cellular . in @xcite , it is shown that affine hecke algebras of rank 2 are affine cellular for all generic choices of parameters .",

    "we can associate to this cell a two - sided ideal @xmath5 of the corresponding affine hecke algebra ( with possibly unequal parameters ) .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is twofold :    1 .   show that the lowest two - sided ideal @xmath5 is affine cellular and explicitely construct a cellular basis ; see section [ main1 ] .",
    "2 .   study the decomposition of the previously found cellular basis in the kazhdan - lusztig basis ; see section [ dec - cel - basis ] .",
    "it is in type @xmath0 that point ( 2 ) above is the nicest : we will show in section [ cel - b - typea ] that the coefficients that appear in the expression of the cellular basis when expressed in the kazhdan - lusztig basis can be interpreted as the number of certain kind of paths in a weyl chamber .",

    "we have proved that @xmath880 .",

    "the set of anti - dominant weights , that is @xmath936 , is just the set of points lying in @xmath937 and at the intersection of @xmath938 hyperplanes . for each antidominant weight @xmath654 ,",
