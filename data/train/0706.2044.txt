    "this paper continues the comparison between lines of minima and teichmller geodesics begun in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a hyperbolizable surface of finite type and @xmath7 be the space of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two measured laminations that fill up @xmath2 .",
    "the associated _ line of minima _ is the path @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the unique hyperbolic surface that minimizes the length function @xmath5 on @xmath7 , see  @xcite and section  [ sec : linesofm ] below .",
    "lines of minima have significance for hyperbolic @xmath10-manifolds : infinitesimally bending @xmath4 along the lamination @xmath0 results in a quasifuchsian group whose convex core boundary has bending measures in the projective classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and in the ratio @xmath11 , see  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove :    [ thm : qgeo0 ] the line of minima @xmath4 , @xmath12 , is a quasi - geodesic with respect to the metric . in other words , there are universal constants @xmath13 , depending only on the topology of @xmath2 , such that for any @xmath14 with @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance .    an obvious way to approach this would be to compare the time-@xmath18 surface @xmath4 with the corresponding surface @xmath19 on the geodesic whose horizontal and vertical foliations at time @xmath18 are respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . in  @xcite , we did just this .",
    "we showed that if neither surface @xmath4 nor @xmath19 contains short curves , that is , they are both contained in the thick part of space , then the distance between them is bounded above by a uniform constant that is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "more generally , we showed that the set of curves which are short on the two surfaces coincide .",
    "we also showed , however , that the ratio of lengths of the same short curve on the two surfaces may be arbitrarily large , so that the path @xmath4 may deviate arbitrarily far from @xmath19 .",
    "it is therefore not immediately obvious how to derive theorem  [ thm : qgeo0 ] from  @xcite . to explain our method , we first summarize the results of  @xcite in more detail .",
    "it turns out that on both @xmath4 and @xmath19 , a curve @xmath22 is short if and only if at least one of two quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 is large .",
    "these quantities depend on the topological relationship between @xmath22 and the defining laminations @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they relate to the modulus of a maximal embedded annulus around @xmath22 ; the modulus of a _ flat _ annulus is approximately @xmath23 and the modulus of an _ expanding _ annulus is approximately @xmath25 , see  @xcite and sections  [ sec : flat ] and  [ sec : estimates ] below .",
    "we say that a curve is _ extremely short _ if it is less than some prescribed @xmath26 depending only on the topology of @xmath2 , see section  [ sec : background ] .",
    "the essential results in  @xcite were the following estimates ( see section  [ sec : background ] for notation ) :    [ thm : glshort ] let @xmath22 be a simple closed curve on @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath22 is extremely short on @xmath19 then @xmath27 while if @xmath22 is extremely short on @xmath4 then @xmath28    [ @xcite theorem 7.15 ] [ thm : gldistance ] the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath19 is given by @xmath29 where the maximum is taken over all simple closed curves @xmath22 that are extremely short in @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the distance between the thick parts of @xmath4 and @xmath19 is bounded .",
    "it follows from these results , that along intervals on which either there are no short curves , or on which @xmath30 dominates for all short curves @xmath22 , the surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath19 remain a bounded distance apart . however the path @xmath4 may deviate arbitrarily far from @xmath19 along time intervals on which @xmath24 is large and dominates @xmath30 .",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that as we move along @xmath4 , the family of curves which are short at a given point in time will vary with @xmath18 , so that the intervals along which different curves @xmath22 are short will overlap .",
    "in addition to the above results from  @xcite , there are two main ingredients in the proof of theorem  [ thm : qgeo0 ] .",
    "the first is a detailed comparison of the rates of change of @xmath31 and @xmath30 with @xmath18 .",
    "some simple estimates are made in lemmas  [ lem : kdecay ] and  [ lem : dandk ] , with more elaborate consequences drawn in lemma  [ lem : hldistance ] and especially lemma  [ lem : dichotomy ] .",
    "these results use minsky s product regions theorem ( see theorem  [ thm : minskyproduct ] ) , which allows us to reduce calculations of distance in regions of space in which a given family of curves is short , to straightforward estimates in @xmath32 . to apply minsky s theorem , we need not only to compare lengths but also twists .",
    "we rely on the bounds on twists proved in  @xcite and reviewed in theorems  [ thm : gtwist ] and  [ thm : ltwist ] ; these enter in a crucial way into the proof of lemma  [ lem : hldistance ] .",
    "the second main ingredient is control of distance along intervals along which @xmath24 is large . consider the surface @xmath33 obtained by cutting @xmath2 along a short curve @xmath22 and replacing the two resulting boundary components by punctures .",
    "the following rather surprising result , proved in section 4 , states that on intervals along which @xmath24 is large , we can estimate the distance by restricting to the space of the surface @xmath33 . in other words , the contribution to distance in minsky s formula  [ thm : minskyproduct ] due to the short curve @xmath22 itself may be neglected , see theorem  [ thm : klarge ] for a precise statement .",
    "[ thm : klarge0 ] if @xmath24 is sufficiently large for all @xmath34 $ ] , the distance in @xmath35 between the restrictions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 to @xmath33 is equal to @xmath38 , up to an additive error that is bounded by a constant depending only on the topology of @xmath2 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : qgeo0 ] requires estimating upper and lower bounds for @xmath39 over very large time intervals @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "given the first of the two ingredients above , the upper bound is relatively straightforward .",
    "the lower bound depends on theorem  [ thm : klarge0 ] .",
    "the actual application involves a rather subtle inductive procedure based on lemma  [ lem : dichotomy ] which shows that at least one term in minsky s formula  [ thm : minskyproduct ] always involves a contribution comparable to @xmath38 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives standard background and introduces the twist @xmath41 of a lamination @xmath42 about a curve @xmath22 with respect to a hyperbolic metric @xmath43 .",
    "we give the main estimates about twists from  @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we recall from @xcite the definitions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and derive some elementary results about their rates of change with @xmath18 . in section 4",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm : klarge0 ] and in section 5 we prove theorem  [ thm : qgeo0 ] .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for helpful comments .",
    "since we will be dealing mainly with coarse estimates , we want to avoid heavy notation and keep track of constants which are universal , in that they do not depend on any specific metric or curve under discussion . for functions @xmath44 we write @xmath45 to mean that there are constants @xmath46 , depending only on the topology of @xmath2 and the fixed constant @xmath47 ( see below ) , such that @xmath48 we use @xmath49 and @xmath50 to mean that these inequalities hold with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the symbols @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , etc . , are defined similarly . in particular , we write @xmath56 to indicate @xmath57 is bounded above by a positive constant depending only on the topology of @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",

    "we will have to make various assumptions to ensure the validity of our estimates , which all require that the length @xmath61 of a ` short ' curve be less than various constants , in particular less than the margulis constant .",
    "we suppose that @xmath26 is chosen once and for all to satisfy all needed assumptions , and say a simple closed curve @xmath22 is _ extremely short _ in @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",

    "suppose @xmath114 is a regular annulus such that the total curvature of @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119 .",

    "consideration of the rate of change of @xmath262 with time shows that the contribution to the change in distance between @xmath263 and @xmath264 from the expanding cylinders is on the order of @xmath265 , so that the actual distance @xmath38 must be realized due to changes in @xmath266 .    in more detail ,",

    "let @xmath272 be the gluing curve in @xmath263 .",
    "since the vertical and horizontal foliations of @xmath273 match along @xmath272 , the surface @xmath263 is naturally equipped with vertical and horizontal foliations @xmath274 and quadratic differential @xmath275 , which we assume is scaled to have area one .",
    "let @xmath276 be the geodesic corresponding to @xmath277 and let @xmath278 be the corresponding family of quadratic differentials . then @xmath259 .",
    "observe that the surface @xmath258 is obtained from @xmath260 by cutting the maximal flat annulus @xmath279 .",
