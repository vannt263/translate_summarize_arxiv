    "@xcite have posed the question whether nonlinear quantum evolution can be considered as providing any help in solving otherwise hard problems , on the grounds that under nonlinear evolution , the output of such a computer on a mixture of inputs is not a convex combination of its output on the pure components of the mixture .",
    "we circumvent this problem here by adopting the standpoint of _ information realism _ , the position that physical states are ultimately information states registered in some way sub - physically but objectively by nature . at this stage , we will not worry about the details except to note an implication for the present situation , which is that from the perspective of ` nature s eye ' , there are no mixed states . therefore , in describing nonlinear physical laws or specifying the working of non - standard computers based on such laws , it suffices for our purpose to specify their action on ( all relevant ) pure state inputs .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out that the assumption of wnhe ( and further that of * p * @xmath10 * np * ) can potentially give a unified explanation of ( a ) the observed ` insularity - in - theoryspace ' of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , namely that qm is _ exactly _ unitary and linear , and requires measurements to conform to the @xmath11 born rule @xcite ; ( b ) the classicality of the macroscopic world ; ( c ) the lack of quantum physical mechanisms for non - signaling superquantum correlations @xcite .    in ( a ) , the basic idea is that departure from one or more of these standard features of qm seems to invest quantum computers with super - turing power to solve hard problems efficiently , thus making the universe an exponential place , contrary to assumption .",

    "it is proposed that the wnhe assumption holds not only in the sense that hard problems ( in the standard turing model ) are not efficiently solvable in the physical world , but in the stronger sense that any physical computation can be simulated on a probabilistic tm with at most a polynomial slowdown in the number of steps ( the strong church - turing thesis ) .",

    ", this suggests that although at small scales , standard qm remains valid with characteristic * bqp*-like behavior , at sufficiently large scales , classical ( ` * bpp*-like ' ) behavior should emerge , and that therefore there must be a definite scale sometimes called the heisenberg cut where the superposition principle breaks down @xcite , so that asymptotically , quantum states are not exponentially long vectors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we speculate that this scale is related to a discretization of hilbert space .",
    "this approach provides a possible computation theoretic resolution to the quantum measurement problem . in ( c ) , the idea is that in a polynomial universe , we expect that phenomena in which a polynomial amount of physical bits can simulate exponentially large ( classical ) correlations , thereby making communication complexity trivial , would be forbidden .    in the present work ,",

    "the quantum optics formalism implies that if the polarizations of the two incoming modes are not parallel when interfering , then the polarization states add vectorially ( that is , superpose ) , with amplitudes being added componentwise along each polarization / dimension , and the resulting probability being the squared magnitude of this vector sum .",
    "one can define a corresponding more general constant gate ( a tensor sum of constant gates over the internal dimensions ) , and a correspondingly potentially larger * bqp*@xmath129 .",
    "it can be shown that theorem [ thm : bqpc ] still holds . here",
    "we will content ourselves to illustrate it by a simple example .",
    "suppose we have this ` interferometric quantum computer ' : a @xmath282-level atom , whose spin part is prepared initially in the state @xmath283 , yielding @xmath284 , i.e. , a particle is detected with with exponentially low probability @xmath285 , and detection leaves the particle in the state @xmath286 .",
    "the oracle together with detection at the path singularity is equivalent to the non - complete operation @xmath287 .",
    "if the marked state is designated to be a possible solution to a sat problem , the measurement would have to be repeated an exponentially large number of times , or performed once on an exponentially large number of atoms , to detect a possible ` yes ' outcome .",
    "either way , the physical situation is compatible with the wnhe assumption , but not with no - signaling .",
    "( we observe that augmenting the detection with a renormalization following vector addition would in fact implement the post - selection gate . ) finally , let us clarify the sense in which non - complete operations like @xmath109 of potential physical interest may _ effectively _ conform to probability conservation",
    ". in the modified innsbruck experiment , alice s application of @xmath109 conforms _ exactly _ to probability conservation , because the state @xmath245 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : srispdc ] ) has a schmidt form , with @xmath109 defined in bob s schmidt basis .",
    "however , this is not the general situation . in such cases ,",
    "one seems to find that the spreading of the wavefunction produces a pattern of bright and dark interferometric fringes at and around the path singularity such that , even though locally there is an excess or deficit over the average probability density , still there is an overall probability conservation across the fringes .",
    "this is somewhat comparable to the situation with bob s povm @xmath288 , which , even though locally a @xmath109-like operation , still yields identity when integrated over @xmath177 .",
    "this conservation mechanism is not applicable to the modified innsbruck experiment , which is performed in the near - field limit , where spreading is minimal and two - particle correlations are strong .",
    "however , as noted above , probability conservation is inherently exact for the situation in the experiment , and the mechanism need not be invoked .    as an illustration of the mechanism ,",
    "let the angle at which the two interfering beams of the ` interferometric quantum compter ' converge towards a spatial overlap region be @xmath220 .",
    "the fringes are given by a stationary pattern with spatial frequency @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is the spatial separation between two optical elements ( say , mirrors ) that are , respectively , reflecting the beams along the two interferometric arms towards @xmath165 , and @xmath291 the distance from the central point between these mirrors to the center of region @xmath165 .",
    "the width of each fringe is about @xmath292 .",
    "now the initial beam width must be of the order of several wavelengths , and the diffractive spread rate of each beam at least @xmath293 , so that beam width @xmath294 .",
    "thus , the spreading of ( quantum ) waves guarantees that there will always be compensatory fringes , and hence overall conservation of probability , even though locally the dark and bright bands contain less or more than the average probability density .    applied to the above atom interferometer example , the state vector at the interference screen will have the form @xmath295 with @xmath220 running from @xmath296 to @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is a narrow gaussian - like function centered at @xmath299 .",
    "when @xmath300 , one obtains dark fringes with the ` solution ' @xmath286 at exponentially low intensity , as noted above .",
    "when @xmath301 , one obtains bright fringes of nearly maximal intensity , diminished by only an exponentially small amount , corresponding , again , to the ` solution ' .",
    "thus the interference pattern is a band of bright and dark fringes at spatial frequency @xmath302 with the bright ones very slightly dimmer than if @xmath303 and @xmath304 had the same polarization , and the dark ones very slightly brighter .",
    "considering the far - reaching implications of a positive result to our proposed experiment , even though we have ruled out in section [ sec : sriung ] all the ( as far as we know ) obvious objections , we have to remain open to the possibility that there may be a subtle error , possibly a hidden unwarrented assumption , somewhere in our analysis . in the surprising event that the proposed experiment yields a positive outcome ,",
    "no - signaling would no longer be a universal condition , and the issue of ` speed of quantum information ' @xcite would assume practical significance .",
    "it would also bolster the case for believing that the wnhe assumption is a basic principle of quantum physics , and that considerations of intractability , and by extension uncomputability , can serve as an informal guide to basic physics .",
    "physical space would be regarded as a type of information , and physical dynamics a kind of computation , with physical separation being not genuine obstacle to rapid communication in the way it would be when seen from the perspective of causality in conventional physics . on the other hand , the barrier between polynomial - time and hard problems would be real , and the physical existence of superluminal signals would thus not be as surprising as that of exponential gates .",
    "interestingly , polynomial superluminal operations exist even in classical computation theory .",
    "the random access machine ( ram ) model @xcite , a standard model in computer science wherein memory access takes exactly one time - step irrespective of the physical location of the memory element , illustrates this idea .",
    "rams are known to be polynomially equivalent to turing machines . even granting that the noncomplete gate @xmath114 turns out to be physically valid and realizable",
    ", this brings us to another important issue : how would non - completeness fit in with the known mathematical structure of the quantum properties of particles and fields ?",
    "we venture that the answer has to do with the nature of and relationship between observables in qm on the one hand , and those in quantum optics , and more generally , in quantum field theory ( qft ) , on the other hand .",
    "it is frequently claimed that qft is just the standard rules of first quantization applied to classical fields , but this position can be criticized @xcite . for example , the relativistic effects of the integer - spin qft imply that the wavefunctions describing a fixed number of particles do not admit the usual probabilistic interpretation @xcite . again , fermionic fields do not really have a classical counterpart and do not represent quantum observables @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "measurable properties resulting from a qft are properties of particles of photons in quantum optics .",
    "particulate properties such as number , described by the number operator constructed from fields , or the momentum operator , which allows the reproduction of single - particle qm in momentum space , do not present a problem .",
    "the problem is the _ position _ variable , which is considered to be a parameter , and not a hermitian operator , both in qft and single - particle relativistic qm , and yet relevant experiments measure particle positions .",
    "the experiment described in this work involves measurement of the positions of photons , as for example , alice s detection of photons at points on the imaging or focal plane , or bob s detection at points on the @xmath177-plane , respectively .",
    "there seems to be no way to derive from qft the experimentally confirmed born rule that the nonrelativistic wavefunction @xmath305 determines quantum probabilities @xmath306 of particle positions . in most practical situations , this is really not a problem .",
    "the probabilities in the above experiment were computed according to standard quantum optical rules to determine the correlation functions at various orders @xcite , which serve as an effective wavefunction of the photon , as seen for example from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coinc ] ) . in qft",
    ", particle physics phenomenologists have developed intuitive rules to predict distributions of particle positions from scattering amplitudes in _ momentum _ space .    nevertheless , there is a problem in principle , and this leads us to ask whether qft is a genuine quantum theory @xcite . if we accept that properties like position are valid observables in qm , the answer seems to be ` no ' .",
    "we see this again in the fact that the effective momentum and position observables that arise in the above experiment are not seen to be hermitian operators of standard qm ( cf . note @xcite ) .",
    "further , non - complete operations like @xmath251 , disallowed in qm , seem to appear in qft .",
    "this suggests that it is qm , and not qft , that is proved to be strictly non - signaling by the no - signaling theorem .    since nonrelativistic qm and qft are presumably not two independent theories describing entirely different objects , but do describe the same particles in many situations , the relationship between observables in the two theories needs to be better understood .",
    "perhaps some quantum mechanical observables are a coarse - graining of qft ones , having wide but not universal validity .",
    "for example , alice s detection of a photon at a point in the focal plane was quantum mechanically understood to project the state of bob s photon into a one - dimensional subspace corresponding to a momentum eigenstate .",
    "quantum optically , however , this ` eigenstate ' is described as a superposition of a number of parallel , in - phase modes originating from different down - conversion events in the non - linear crystal , producing a coherent plane wave propagating in a particular direction .",
