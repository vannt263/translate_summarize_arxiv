    "during solar cycle 21 , a short periodicity between 152158 days was discovered in @xmath0 ray flares @xcite , x ray flares @xcite , flares producing energetic interplanetary electrons @xcite , type ii and iv radio bursts @xcite , and microwave flares @xcite .",
    "however , this periodicity was absent during solar cycle 22 @xcite .",
    "the periodicity has also been detected in indicators of solar activity ( sunspot blocking function , sunspot areas , `` active '' sunspot groups , group sunspot numbers ) which suggest that it is associated preferentially with photospheric regions of compact magnetic field structures @xcite .",
    "probably , the most important , and enigmatic , feature of the periodicity is that it appears during epochs of maximum activity and that it occurs in episodes of 1 to 3 years .",
    "@xcite performed a study of the magnetic flux variations during solar cycle 21 which reveals the existence of quasi - periodic pulses or episodes of enhanced magnetic activity .",
    "the duration of the pulses is @xmath1 5 rotations during the years around maximum activity , the epoch in which the flare periodicity appears , and the comparison with magnetic field maps indicates that those pulses of activity correspond to the occurrence of complex active regions containing large sunspots @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed several data sets of , or strongly related to , photospheric magnetic flux to point out that the appearance of the near 160-day periodicity in different manifestations of solar activity during solar cycle 21 has its underlying cause in the appearance of the periodicity in the magnetic flux linked to regions of strong magnetic field .",
    "they also showed that during solar cycle 22 the periodicity does not appear in the photospheric magnetic flux records and , as a consequence , the periodicity did not appear in other solar activity indicators , while during solar cycle 23 it appeared in the photospheric magnetic flux but not in other solar activity indicators .",
    "several mechanisms have been put forward in order to explain the existence of this periodicity .",
    "@xcite linked it to the interaction of rotating features ( active longitude bands ) resulting from g - modes with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cause of this periodicity must be a mechanism that causes active regions to be more flare productive .",
    "later , @xcite concluded that it can not be due to the interaction of hot spots `` , i.e. regions where flare activity is higher than elsewhere @xcite , rotating at different rates and that the cause must be a mechanism involving the whole sun .",
    "@xcite suggested that it is related to the timescale for storage and/or escape of magnetic fields in the solar convection zone .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the possible intermittency of the periodicity , suggested that this behavior could be simulated with a damped , periodically forced non - linear oscillator , which shows periodic behavior for some values of the parameters and chaotic behavior for other values .",
    "@xcite argued that such periodicity can be understood in terms of the normal modes of oscillation of a nearly spherical , slowly rotating star , when two r - modes ( inertial modes ) couple with an interior g - mode beat .",
    "this suggestion seems to agree qualitatively with the fact that the periodicity is stronger around the activity maximum .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that the sun contains a clock '' , modeled by an oblique rotator or oscillator , with a period of 25.8 days and suggested that the periodicity of 154 days is just a subharmonic of that fundamental period .",
    "later , @xcite modified the earlier period to the value 25.50 days , but that model seems to be very constrained by helioseismological data about the rotation of the sun s interior .",
    "@xcite suggested that such periodicities can be related to large - scale equatorially trapped rossby - type waves showing that , for typical solar parameters , the periods of these waves ( with n = 1 and m even ) are in good agreement with the observed ones .",
    "moreover , @xcite has also pointed out that such waves can give rise to detectable features , such as surface elevations in the photosphere .",
    "coincidently , @xcite have reported observations made with mdi onboard soho and claim to have detected a regular structure of 100-m hills  , uniformly spaced over the surface of the sun with a characteristic separation of 90,000 km .",
    "they suggest that this structure is the surface manifestation of rossby waves , or r - modes oscillations .",
    "finally , @xcite have linked the found periodicities in different classes ( b , c , m , x ) of x - ray flares with the theoretical periods derived by @xcite , pointing out that odd m periodicities are also frequent and significant .    on the other hand ,",
    "most of the proposed mechanisms to explain solar flares , specially the most energetic ones , accept as a prerequisite the emergence of magnetic flux @xcite which , by reconnection with the ambient field , triggers the destabilization of active regions . based on this mechanism ,",
    "carbonell & ballester ( 1990 , 1992 ) suggested that the periodic increase in the occurrence rate of energetic flares is related to a periodic emergence of magnetic flux through the photosphere .",
    "later , oliver et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that during solar cycle 21 there was a perfect time correlation between the intervals of occurrence of the periodicity in sunspot areas and energetic flares , and @xcite clearly pointed out that in cycle 21 , and during the time interval in which the periodicity appeared , there was a perfect time and frequency coincidence between the impulses of high - energy flares and those corresponding to strong photospheric magnetic flux .",
    "the efficiency of the reconnection mechanism depends on the geometry of the two flux systems @xcite and recent high resolution observations performed by @xcite have confirmed the suitability of the mentioned mechanism for flare production",
    ".    emerged magnetic flux is probably connected to deeper regions , namely to the tachocline , which is a thin , transition layer between differentially rotating convection zone and rigidly rotating radiative envelope .",
    "the tachocline may prevent the spreading of the solar angular momentum from the convection zone to the interior @xcite and probably it is the place , where the large - scale magnetic field which governs the solar activity is generated / amplified .",
    "the observed periodicity of 155160 days in the emerging flux is in the range of rossby wave spectrum .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the periodicity is connected to the rossby wave activity in the tachocline .",
    "rossby waves are well studied in the geophysical context @xcite , however , the presence of magnetic fields significantly modifies their dynamics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the differential rotation , which is inevitably present in the tachocline , may lead to the instability of particular harmonics of magnetic rossby waves .",
    "it has been shown that the joint action of toroidal magnetic field and the differential rotation generally leads to tachocline instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , the stability analysis usually has been performed in an inertial frame , which complicates to extract the information about unstable rossby modes .",
    "therefore , it is of paramount importance to perform the stability analysis in a rotating frame .",
    "another important point is that the consideration of a rotating frame may tighten the stability criteria as it has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "the difference between the present analysis and that by @xcite is the inclusion of rotation which allows us to obtain rossby wave solutions .    in this paper",
    ", we use a rotating spherical coordinate system to study the linear stability of magnetic rossby waves in the solar tachocline taking into account the latitudinal differential rotation and the toroidal magnetic field . we perform a two dimensional analysis , which can be followed in the future by more sophisticated shallow water considerations @xcite .",
    "we first derive the analytical conditions of instability similar to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "then , we perform a detailed stability analysis using legendre polynomial expansions @xcite to obtain the spectrum of unstable harmonics of magnetic rossby waves .",
    "since the rossby wave spectrum is clearly seen in the rotating frame , in the following we use a spherical coordinate system @xmath4 rotating with the solar equator , where @xmath5 is the radial coordinate , @xmath6 is the co - latitude and @xmath7 is the longitude .",
    "the solar differential rotation law in general is @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the equatorial angular velocity , and @xmath11 are constant parameters determined by observations .",
    "rossby waves are mainly polarized in the plane perpendicular to gravity , then a two - dimensional @xmath12 analysis is a good approximation @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional analysis is also justified by squire s theorem which states that for each unstable 3-dimensional disturbance there is a corresponding unstable 2-dimensional disturbance with stronger growth rate @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is predominantly toroidal , @xmath13 , in the solar tachocline , and we take @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is in general a function of co - latitude .",
    "then , the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in the frame rotating with @xmath10 are ( see appendix a ) : @xmath16",

    "they define two different semicircles in the complex @xmath59-plane , and the instability occurs when the two semicircles overlap ( see @xcite for the same statement in the rectangular case ) .",
    "if the radius of one semicircle tends to zero , the instability disappears . in the remaining we use a magnetic field",
    "@xmath69 which changes sign at the equator @xcite .    now , we may estimate the instability bounds under tachocline conditions .",
    "an important step is to choose the parameters of differential rotation , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these parameters are determined by observations and their values at the solar surface are @xmath72 .",
    "helioseismology shows that the transition between the differentially rotating convective zone and the rigidly rotating radiative interior is described by the function @xmath73)$ ] , where @xmath74 is the error function , @xmath75 is the radius of the central point of the tachocline and @xmath76 is the characteristic thickness of the tachocline corresponding to a variation of @xmath77 from @xmath78 , at the bottom of the tachocline , to @xmath79 , at the tachocline s upper surface @xcite . in order to calculate the parameters of the differential rotation at the upper part of the tachocline , the solar surface values",
    "must be multiplied by @xmath79 , then , we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "however , it must be mentioned , that the real values of these parameters can be different in the tachocline @xcite and also can change through the solar cycle due to torsional oscillations @xcite .",
    "therefore , these values are tentative and further observations are needed to infer the correct parameters and their cycle dependence .",
    "the typical values of equatorial angular velocity , radius and density in the tachocline are @xmath81 s@xmath82 , @xmath83  cm and @xmath84  g @xmath85 @xmath86 respectively .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath87 is much smaller than unity being @xmath88 for a magnetic field strength of @xmath89 g. using these parameters we get @xmath90 and @xmath91 for azimuthal wave number @xmath92 .",
    "then , the conditions ( [ inequality1 ] ) and ( [ semicircle ] ) give that the minimum period of the @xmath92 unstable modes in the tachocline is @xmath93 therefore , only the magnetic rossby modes with periods longer than @xmath94 days may grow in time .",
    "however , equation ( [ minimum ] ) only gives a lower bound for oscillation periods .",
    "a more detailed analysis is required to reveal the spectrum of possible unstable harmonics .",

    "the dispersion relation for the infinite number of harmonics can be obtained when the infinite determinant of the system is set to zero . in order to solve the determinant",
    ", we truncate the series at @xmath101 and solve the resulting polynomial in @xmath59 numerically .",
    "the frequencies of different harmonics can be real or complex giving the stable or unstable character of a particular harmonic .",
    "it turns out that @xmath92 harmonics are more unstable such as it has been systematically shown by previous works in many different occasions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the real , @xmath102 , and imaginary , @xmath103 , frequencies of all @xmath92 unstable harmonics for different combinations of differential rotation parameters and magnetic field strength . in order to show the dependence on the parameters @xmath104 , we vary these parameters for different values of magnetic field strength so that the sum @xmath105 ( which is the difference in equatorial and polar angular velocities ) remains 0.26 . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , the upper left panel corresponds to the case considered in appendix c ( i.e. @xmath106 ) .",
    "blue , green , yellow and red colors correspond to magnetic field strengths of @xmath107  g , @xmath108  g , @xmath109  g and @xmath110  g , respectively . asterisks ( circles ) denote the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) harmonics with respect to the equator .",
    "the results show that the @xmath111 term in the differential rotation ( [ omegad3 ] ) significantly affects the behaviour of unstable harmonics @xcite . for each combination of @xmath104 and the magnetic field strength ,",
    "there is a particular unstable harmonic with a growth rate much stronger than for the other harmonics .",
    "this harmonic is symmetric with respect to the equator and has the frequency of 0.17 - 0.18 @xmath10 ( yielding periods of 150 - 160 days ) for the magnetic field strength of @xmath112  g. the frequency decreases for stronger magnetic fields ( red colors ) , therefore rieger - type periodicities arise as symmetric unstable harmonics for relatively weaker magnetic field strength .",
    "thus , the appearance of a strong oscillation with a particular frequency needs a suitable combination of differential rotation parameters ( @xmath104 ) and magnetic field strength .",
    "however , the differential rotation parameters used in figure  [ fig2 ] are probably too high for the solar tachocline .",
    "therefore , we study the dependence of unstable harmonics on more realistic differential rotation rates .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the dependence of the most unstable symmetric harmonic ( this harmonic can be identified on fig .",
    "2 as the blue , green , yellow and red asterisks at top of each panel ) on the differential rotation parameters for two different values of the magnetic field . left panels correspond to the field strength of 2@xmath113  g and right panels correspond to the strength of @xmath114  g. real and imaginary parts of the harmonic vs @xmath115 are plotted for different values of @xmath116 .",
    "the values of @xmath116 vary from 0.14 ( blue color ) to 0.09 ( yellow color ) .",
    "we can observe that the frequency , @xmath117 , of this harmonic is only slightly dependent on the differential rotation parameters and takes values between 0.16 - 0.18 @xmath10 which correspond to oscillation periods of 150 - 170 days .",
    "this is the range where the rieger - type periodicity has been observed . on the contrary",
    ", the growth rate , @xmath118 , of this harmonic strongly depends on the differential rotation parameters .",
    "the growth rate becomes stronger when both @xmath116 and @xmath115 , are increased .",
    "the frequency and growth rate of this harmonic have no significant dependence on the magnetic field when its strength is smaller than @xmath119  g. figure  [ fig4 ] shows the dependence of the harmonic calculated for three different profiles of the differential rotation ( blue line corresponds to @xmath120 , @xmath121 ; the red line to @xmath122 , @xmath123 and green line to @xmath122 , @xmath121 ) .",
    "we can observe that the stronger growth rate occurs for the red line , which means that @xmath115 is more important for the instability .    when the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the energy of differential rotation , then the frequency of the symmetric harmonic",
    "is significantly reduced ( see red asterisks on figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the critical magnetic field strength , i.e. when the magnetic energy is comparable to the flow energy , is @xmath124  g for the differential rotation parameters @xmath1250.13 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath126 , the radius of first semicircle @xmath60 ( see eq . ( 15 ) ) tends to zero and the growth of symmetric unstable harmonics is suppressed .",
    "the periodicity of 155 - 160 days was discovered almost three decades ago , however the reason of its appearance / disappearance is still unknown .",
    "the most striking feature , perhaps , is its appearance only at certain times , which normally coincide with the maximum of the cycle ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this coincidence naturally suggests that the magnetic field and the differential rotation at the solar cycle maximum provide suitable conditions for the appearance of this periodicity .",
    "here we show that the periodicity can be connected to the dynamics of magnetic rossby waves in the tachocline , since , in this layer , they are unstable due to the presence of toroidal magnetic field and latitudinal differential rotation .",
    "first , we have derived the analytical bounds of instability , which state that @xmath92 unstable modes have periods @xmath127 days .",
    "next , we have calculated the detailed spectrum of unstable harmonics using the method of legendre polynomial expansion .",
    "we have found that the behaviour of unstable harmonics is very sensitive to the combination of magnetic field strength and the differential rotation parameters ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "each combination of the parameters favours a particular harmonic , which has stronger growth rate compared to other unstable harmonics .",
    "therefore , this harmonic may quickly dominate over the others and may lead to a detectable oscillation , if the parameters remain more or less unchanged during some time .",
    "unstable harmonics have two types of symmetry with respect to the equator : symmetric and antisymmetric .",
    "the growth rates of symmetric modes are higher than the antisymmetric ones and they depend on the differential rotation parameters ; the growth becomes stronger for stronger shear .",
    "frequencies of symmetric unstable modes are in the range 0.16 - 0.18 @xmath10 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) , which yield the periods of 150 - 170 days . in the case of strong differential rotation",
    ", their growth rate may reach up to 0.015 @xmath10 i.e. the growth time is @xmath128 280 days .",
    "therefore , they may quickly dominate over the rest .",
    "the growth of the magnetic rossby wave amplitude leads to an enhanced magnetic buoyancy at the tachocline which causes the periodic eruption of magnetic flux towards the solar surface .",
    "therefore , the periodicity is observed in the emerged magnetic flux and consequently in many indicators of solar activity ( see references in the introduction ) .",
    "the question why the periodicities appear only at particular times ( mostly just after solar maximum , see figure  [ fig6 ] ) needs additional explanation .",
    "a possible reason is that the growth of symmetric harmonics strongly depends on the differential rotation parameters ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "it is known that the solar differential rotation is changing through the solar cycle . the pattern known as the torsional oscillation has been first observed at the solar surface in full disc velocity measurements @xcite and later in surface magnetic features as well @xcite .",
    "helioseismology shows that the torsional oscillation is not only a surface phenomenon but may penetrate deeper into the solar interior @xcite .",
    "then , the parameters @xmath104 may vary through the solar cycle in the tachocline , which permits the strong growth of symmetric magnetic rossby waves only at particular times .",
    "this time should coincide with the solar maximum .",
    "we think that additional helioseismic estimations are needed to study this phenomenon .",
    "one of the significant simplifications in our approach is the linear stability analysis .",
    "the growth of perturbation amplitudes probably leads to nonlinear effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the process would be accompanied by increased magnetic buoyancy , which causes the eruption of magnetic flux upwards and consequently may stop further growth of amplitudes .",
    "these processes should be studied with sophisticated numerical simulations in the future .",
    "it should be mentioned here that numerous previous papers have studied the tachocline instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , all the calculations have been performed in an inertial frame , while the rossby wave dynamics is more clearly seen in a rotating frame .",
    "another important difference between inertial and rotating frames is that the instability conditions may be tightened in the moving frame as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the solar tachocline may consists of two parts : the inner radiative layer with a strongly stable stratification and the outer overshoot layer with a weakly stable stratification @xcite .",
    "the latitudinal differential rotation should be stronger in the upper tachocline and weaker in the lower one .",
    "on the contrary , the magnetic field strength should be higher in the lower part and smaller in the upper one .",
    "therefore , the upper tachocline may favor the better conditions for the growth of symmetric unstable harmonics , which trigger the rieger - type periodicities .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the destabilization of magnetic rossby waves in the solar tachocline is produced by the joint effect of the latitudinal differential rotation and the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the frequencies and growth rates of unstable harmonics depend on the combination of the differential rotation parameters and the magnetic field strength .",
    "the possible increase of latitudinal differential rotation at the solar maximum may trigger the instability of symmetric harmonic with period of 155 - 160 days in the upper part of the tachocline .",
    "this instability has a direct correlation with magnetic flux emergence , therefore the periodicity also appears in solar activity indicators related with magnetic flux .",
    "later on , and probably via reconnection , this periodic magnetic flux emergence triggers the observed periodicity in solar flares .",
    "the magnetic rossby wave theory opens a new research area about the activity on the sun and other stars , and magnetic rossby waves can be of paramount importance for observed intermediate periodicities in solar and stellar activity @xcite .",

    "<S> apart from the 11-year solar cycle , another periodicity around 155 - 160 days was discovered during solar cycle 21 in high energy solar flares , and its presence in sunspot areas and strong magnetic flux has been also reported . </S>",
    "<S> this periodicity has an elusive and enigmatic character , since it usually appears only near the maxima of solar cycles , and seems to be related with a periodic emergence of strong magnetic flux at the solar surface . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is probably connected with the tachocline , a thin layer located near the base of the solar convection zone , where strong dynamo magnetic field is stored . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamics of rossby waves in the tachocline in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field and latitudinal differential rotation . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the magnetic rossby waves are generally unstable and that the growth rates are sensitive to the magnetic field strength and to the latitudinal differential rotation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> variation of the differential rotation and the magnetic field strength throughout the solar cycle enhance the growth rate of a particular harmonic in the upper part of the tachocline around the maximum of the solar cycle . </S>",
    "<S> this harmonic is symmetric with respect to the equator and has a period of 155 - 160 days . </S>",
    "<S> a rapid increase of the wave amplitude could give place to a magnetic flux emergence leading to observed periodicities in solar activity indicators related with magnetic flux . </S>"
