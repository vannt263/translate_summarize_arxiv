    "the jovian trojans are asteroidal objects confined to two swarms in jupiter s orbit , leading and trailing the planet by @xmath12 of longitude ( known as the l4 and l5 trojans , respectively ) .",
    "the first recognized jovian trojan ( 588 achilles ) , discovered in 1906 by max wolf , was taken as providing observational confirmation of lagrange s prediction of stable orbits at the triangular points .",
    "currently , 132 jovian trojans have been numbered while another 125 await permanent designations .",
    "these objects follow loose orbits that librate around the l4 and l5 points with periods near 150 years .",
    "recent work has shown that trojan orbits are destabilized by collisional ejection ( for which the loss rate of bodies larger than 1 km in diameter is estimated at @xmath9@xmath13  yr@xmath14 ; marzari et al .",
    "1997 ) and , to a lesser extent , by dynamical chaos ( corresponding loss rate @xmath9@xmath15  yr@xmath14 ; levison , shoemaker and shoemaker 1997 ) .",
    "the implication is that the trojans must either be the remnants of a much more substantial initial population of trapped bodies or that these objects are continually replenished from an unidentified external source .",
    "the origin of the trojans is a subject of much conjecture .",
    "the principal dynamical problem concerns the nature of the dissipation needed to stabilize objects in weakly bound orbits librating about l4 and l5 .",
    "schemes under consideration include capture of near - jupiter planetesimals by gas drag in an early phase of the solar nebula ( peale 1993 ) , stabilization of planetesimals near the l4 and l5 points due to the rapidly increasing mass of jupiter in the late stages of its growth ( marzari and scholl 1998 ) , and collisional dissipation followed by capture of asteroidal fragments ( shoemaker et al .",
    "physical observations provide only limited clues about the source of the trojans .",
    "the optical ( jewitt and luu 1990 ; fitzsimmons et al .",
    "1994 ) and near - infrared ( luu , jewitt and cloutis 1994 ; dumas , owen and barruci 1998 ) reflection spectra appear featureless , and are reminiscent of the spectra of the nuclei of short - period comets .",
    "like cometary nuclei , the trojans have very low ( @xmath94% ) visual albedos ( cruikshank 1977 ; tedesco 1989 ) that suggest carbonized surface compositions .",
    "if the trojans formed near or beyond jupiter s orbit , temperatures were probably low enough for water to exist as solid ice ( rather than vapor , as in the inner nebula ) .",
    "this fact has led to the suggestion that the trojans might possess ice - rich interiors equivalent to those of the cometary nuclei , a possibility which is not contradicted by any available observations ( jewitt 1996 ) .    in this paper , we discuss the results of an optical survey taken in the direction of the l4 jovian swarm .",
    "the survey differs from most previous work on these objects in two main respects .",
    "first , it is based on the use of a digital ( ccd ) detector instead of photographic plates and so has relatively high sensitivity to faint ( small ) jovian trojans .",
    "second , the parameters of the survey are extremely well known as a consequence of the relative ease with which digital data may be calibrated ( compared to non - linear , analog photographic data ) .",
    "therefore , we are able to measure the statistical properties of the l4 trojans with greater confidence than would be possible with photographic data . a preliminary abstract describing this work ( chen et al .",
    "1997 ) is superceded by the present report .",
    "the present observations were taken as part of a study of the kuiper belt , the main results of which are already published ( jewitt , luu and trujillo 1998 ) . here",
    "we present observations taken ut 1996 oct .  7 to 15 at the @xmath16 cassegrain focus of the university of hawaii 2.2-meter telescope with a 8192@xmath08192 pixel ccd mosaic ( hereafter called 8k ) .",
    "the 8k consists of eight 2048@xmath04096 pixel loral chips with 15 @xmath17 m pixels and gaps between chips of @xmath91  mm .",
    "the pixels were binned 3@xmath03 in order to reduce the readout time ( from approximately 6 minutes to 1 minute ) while maintaining nyquist sampling of the images .",
    "the binned image scale was @xmath18/pixel yielding a field of view 18.4@xmath018.4 ( 0.094 deg@xmath1 ) .",
    "typical image quality ( including contributions from the intrinsic seeing , wind shake and tracking oscillations during the unguided integrations ) varied from 0.8  to 1.0  full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , meaning that the images were nyquist sampled .",
    "the images were taken with a 150-sec integration time through a specially optimized vr filter ( bandwidth 5000   to 7000  ; jewitt , luu and trujillo 1998 ) .",
    "each sky position was imaged at three epochs , with a separation between epochs of about 1 hour . in total",
    ", we observed 20 deg@xmath1 of sky in the direction of l4 .",
    "the data were flattened using a median combination of dithered images of the evening twilight sky .",
    "observations of photometric standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) were used to calibrate the sensitivity of each chip . by defining an a0 star to have @xmath19 , an object of solar color ( @xmath20 ) has @xmath21 .",
    "we adopted the latter relation to transform our vr magnitude to standard @xmath22 magnitude in this work .",
    "note that trojan asteroids display a wide range of optical colors , from nearly solar to very red ( @xmath23 : jewitt and luu 1990 , fitzsimmons et al .",
    "1994 ) , leading to the introduction of small , color - dependent corrections to the @xmath22 vs. @xmath24 relation .",
    "in addition , some of the 8k ccds were of locally inferior photometric quality .",
    "together , these effects introduce an inherent uncertainty in the absolute photometric accuracy of about 0.2 mag .",
    "trojans were identified using the mods detection program ( trujillo and jewitt 1998 ) .",
    "we determined the detection efficiency of mods by searching for artificial objects added to real data .",
    "the efficiency is adequately fitted by the function    @xmath25\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the maximum detection efficiency , @xmath27 is the trojan magnitude , @xmath28 is the magnitude at which the detection efficiency equals @xmath29 , and @xmath30 measures the width of the band of decreasing detection efficiency .",
    "when including the trailing loss due to the motion of the trojans during the integration , we found @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "variations in the seeing within the data are small and affect @xmath28 by at most @xmath34 mag .",
    "( i.e. , less than the formal uncertainty in the absolute photometry ) .",
    "we took all observations near opposition , where the rate of retrograde motion across the sky , @xmath35 [ @xmath36/hr ] , is inversely related to the heliocentric distance . with this constraint",
    "we could not observe the l4 point directly , but instead mapped areas at a range of angular distances from the lagrangian point ( figure  1 ) . in addition , because we could not afford to interfere with our primary ( kuiper belt ) observational program , we secured no follow - up astrometry of trojan candidates with which to determine orbital elements .",
    "instead , we used the sky - plane angular speed to distinguish trojans from main - belt asteroids .",
    "the main - belt asteroids move westward at rates generally higher than the more distant trojans , permitting us to separate the two types of object on the basis of speed .",
    "figure 2a shows the apparent velocities in ra and dec of numbered main - belt asteroids and previously known trojans in the direction of our observations on 1996 october 10 .",
    "the curves in figure  2a show the loci of points having total angular motions @xmath37/hr and @xmath38/hr . at @xmath39/hr",
    "we find exclusively main - belt asteroids ( fig .",
    "roughly equal numbers of main - belt and trojan asteroids appear in the range @xmath40/hr . on the other hand , a large majority ( @xmath990% ) of the objects with @xmath41/hr are trojans .",
    "therefore , @xmath41/hr constitutes our operational definition of trojans in this survey .",
    "this definition is clearly not perfect , but it is sufficiently robust that we can make statistical identifications of the jovian trojans in our data .",
    "figure  2b shows all 93 trojan candidates flagged by the detection software . of these ,",
    "only the 4th object in table 1 has position and motion consistent with a previously known trojan asteroid ( 6020",
    "p - l ) . the best evidence that we have indeed obtained a sample dominated by trojans , as opposed to foreground main - belt asteroids ,",
    "is provided by the sky - plane surface density distribution of the 93 identified objects ( figure  3 ) .",
    "this distribution is peaked towards l4 in a manner incompatible with the azimuthally uniform distribution of the main - belt asteroids .",
    "_ ( a ) luminosity function _",
    "photometry was performed using a circular aperture @xmath42 in projected diameter , with sky subtraction from a contiguous annulus @xmath43 wide ( table 1 ) .",
    "this aperture was selected by trial and error to give a stable measure of the flux while minimizing photometric noise from the background sky .",
    "the statistical photometric uncertainty is @xmath440.2 mag at the faint end and less than @xmath440.1 mag at the bright end of the magnitude distribution . for comparison with other work",
    ", it is useful to employ the absolute @xmath22 magnitude , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 [ au ] and @xmath47 [ au ] are the heliocentric and geocentric distances , respectively .",
    "the correction to zero phase angle has been ignored ( since the phase angles near opposition are small ) .",
    "the distances @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not accurately known for the individual trojan asteroids .",
    "we adopt the mean distances of the numbered l4 trojans at the epoch of observation , namely @xmath48 au and @xmath49 au . here , the quoted errors are @xmath6 standard deviations and the dispersion in @xmath46 and @xmath47 results from the finite extent of the l4 swarm along the line of sight . with these values",

    "the brightest ( faintest ) trojan detected in the present survey has @xmath59 corresponding approximately to @xmath60 km ( 1.5 km ) .",

    "figure  5 shows the cumulative luminosity function ( clf ) computed from the present data .",
    "the `` @xmath0 '' marks in the figure show the distribution of the raw counts while the filled circles show the distribution corrected for the detection efficiency .",
    "we have not included a correction for contamination of the trojan sample by main - belt interlopers . as noted above",
    ", this is a small effect whose inclusion would decrease the estimated surface densities at all magnitudes by about 10% .",
    "error bars in figure  5 were estimated from poisson statistics .",
    "the luminosity function is taken to be of the form    @xmath62    a least - squares fit to the differential magnitude distribution gives slope parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the three lines in figure  5 have gradients @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that the radii of trojans follow a differential power law distribution such that the number of objects having radii in the range @xmath67 is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants .",
    "for objects all located at a single heliocentric and geocentric distance , @xmath71 and @xmath70 are related by @xmath72 ( irwin et al .",
    "thus , the present data suggest @xmath73 in the radius range @xmath74 km . for comparison , shoemaker et al .",
    "1989 estimated @xmath75 for @xmath76  mag ( corresponding to @xmath77 in the approximate range @xmath78 km , assuming @xmath79 ) , but did not state their uncertainty .",
    "we consider these determinations to be in good agreement .",
    "the difference between @xmath70 measured here and the canonical @xmath80 distribution produced by collisional shattering ( dohnanyi 1969 ) is statistically insignificant . in any case , unmodeled effects will cause the trojan distribution to differ from a dohnanyi power law .",
    "for example , the velocity of ejection of collision fragments varies inversely with fragment size ( as @xmath81 , nakamura and fujiwara 1991 ) .",
    "following collisional production the small trojans should preferentially escape from the l4 region , leading to a distribution flatter than the dohnanyi power law ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) .",
    "we consider it likely that the small trojan asteroids are collisionally produced fragments of once larger bodies ( c.f .",

    "_ ( b ) inclination - frequency distribution _",
    "we are able to measure the position angles of the proper - motion vectors of the trojans with an uncertainty of about @xmath83 .",
    "the proper - motion vectors can not be accurately converted to orbital inclinations without a fuller knowledge of the orbits than we possess .",

    "( 5 ) we have assumed that the orbital eccentricities are zero , that the proper motion is the vector difference of the intrinsic motion of the trojans from the orbital motion of earth and that the observations are taken at opposition . in the limit @xmath87 , @xmath88 so that with @xmath89 au we find @xmath90 .",
    "one object in table 1 has @xmath91 ( # 26 ) . presumably , it is a main belt asteroid whose sky - plane velocity falls fortuitously within the trojan domain .",
    "the distribution of intrinsic inclinations ( figure  6a ) has a mean @xmath92 , median @xmath93 .",
    "trojans with large inclinations spend most of their time away from the ecliptic , leading to a bias against their detection .",
    "the bias correction varies approximately in inverse proportion to the orbital inclination .",
    "figure  6b shows the inclination distribution after correction by the factor @xmath94 and normalization to figure  6a in the range @xmath95 .",
    "the bias - corrected mean inclination is @xmath96 which compares favorably with shoemaker et al.s 1989 best estimate for the mean inclination of the larger trojans ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "observers of trojan asteroids two decades ago suspected that `` there is a possibility that the inclinations are bimodal ... with groups separated by a minimum at @xmath98 '' ( degewij and van houten 1979 ) .",
    "there is indeed an apparent lack of trojans in the corrected inclination distribution with @xmath99 , giving a bimodal appearance ( fig .",
    "however , inspection of the raw data in figure  6a shows that the local minimum is statistically insignificant .",
    "furthermore , the inclination distribution of numbered and un - numbered l4 trojans ( from an electronic list maintained by brian marsden at the minor planet center ) shows no evidence for bimodality ( figure  7 ) .",

    "holman and wisdom ( 1992 ) found that the theoretical stable zones of the jupiter lagrange point have an angular radius of about @xmath110 .",
    "the angular half width of the swarm along the ecliptic ( @xmath111 ) is comparable to the bias - corrected mean inclination ( @xmath112 ) , meaning that we may take the projected outline of the swarm as approximately circular in the plane of the sky .",

    "systematic errors may also affect @xmath122 , particularly since the surface density at @xmath123 is not measured in our survey .",

    "( 10 ) we find the number of l4 trojans with @xmath136 km is @xmath137 , to within a factor of order 2 . for comparison , there were 5700 numbered and 1100 unnumbered main - belt asteroids with @xmath136 km as of 1999 july 29 .",
    "these estimates validate the assertion by shoemaker et al .",

    "the number of l4 trojans with @xmath138 km is @xmath139 , from eq .",
    "( 11 ) .",
    "the most straightforward explanation of the slope differences ( eq .  8 and 9 and",
    "figure  9 ) is that the large objects represent a primordial population while trojans smaller than a critical radius , @xmath140 , are produced from the larger ones by collisional shattering ( shoemaker et al .",

    "they suggested that this might mark the primordial / fragment transition size , with larger bodies retaining the aspherical forms in which they were created ( we note that this explanation is clearly non - unique ) . inspection of their figure  21 shows that the transition radius defined in this way is uncertain to within a factor of 2 and fully compatible with @xmath141 km as found here .",
    "we conclude that two independently measured physical parameters ( the size distribution and the lightcurve amplitude distribution ) show evidence for a change near @xmath144 km to 40 km .",
    "the total mass of trojans is    @xmath145    where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are from eqs .",

    "we find @xmath150 kg @xmath151 , equivalent to a 400 km radius sphere having the same density .",
    "dynamical calculations show that escaped trojans would be quickly scattered into orbits indistinguishable from those of some short - period comets ( marzari et al .",
