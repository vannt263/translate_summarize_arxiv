    "x - ray radiation from young stars are fundamentally important for molecular stellar environments .",

    "x - ray irradiation of circumstellar molecular gas drives important chemistry , including production or destruction of water @xcite .",
    "x - rays heat disk surfaces to temperatures of several thousand k @xcite , giving rise to ( partial ) photoevaporation of , and therefore mass loss from , the innermost disk regions @xcite .",
    "stellar x - ray astronomy has concentrated on the _ soft _ x - ray range ( sxr , @xmath0  0.110  kev ) , where _ thermal _ bremsstrahlung and line radiation dominate .",
    "harder x - rays @xmath110  kev ( hxr ) are somewhat of a _ terra incognita _ in stellar astronomy , notwithstanding a few firm detections beyond @xmath2  kev and marginal claims for detections of non - thermal hxr .",
    "simbol - x promises a breakthrough for stellar hxr , thus opening a window to deeply embedded , young x - ray sources and to the physics of magnetic energy release in young , magnetically active stars @xcite .",
    "it is essentially unknown when during star formation _ stellar _",
    "magnetic fields first appear , and whether they are fossil or are generated by internal dynamos .",
    "our understanding of magnetic - field induced high - energy environments of the youngest stars is very limited .",
    "a rather comprehensive picture of the x - ray characteristics of t tauri stars ( tts ) is available , especially from large recent surveys with xmm - newton and chandra @xcite . in short , tts x - ray emission",
    "mostly originates from magnetic coronae , with characteristics similar to more evolved active main - sequence stars .",
    "their x - rays saturate at a level of log(@xmath3 . because for a typical pre - main sequence association @xmath4 roughly correlates with stellar mass @xmath5",
    ", one also finds a distinct correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "flaring is common in tts @xcite , the most energetic examples reaching temperatures of @xmath8  k @xcite .    the complex stellar environments of protostars and tts may lead to further x - ray sources .",
    "accretion streams may form shocks at the stellar surface , producing very soft x - rays .",
    "the evidence is twofold : unusually high electron densities have been inferred from spectral line ratios from a handful of tts @xcite , and a general `` soft excess '' , defined by an anomalously high ratio of ovii  @xmath9 to oviii  @xmath10 line fluxes @xcite .",
    "jets and outflows may shock heat some gas to @xmath11  mk , both in herbig - haro objects far away from the driving stars @xcite and internal to jets very close to the stars @xcite .",
    "these x - ray sources are also soft , typically detected only below @xmath01 - 2  kev .",
    "this is not surprising given the energy available from shock velocities of no more than a few hundred km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the picture is much less complete for earlier phases of star formation owing to strong x - ray attenuation .",
    "non - thermal radio emission from class i protostars suggests the presence not only of magnetic fields but also accelerated particles , both in distant regions of outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) and within the stellar corona @xcite .    for `` class 0 objects '' ( the earliest phase of a forming star ) ,",
    "a few promising candidates but no definitive cases have been reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite summarize several class 0 non - detections , with a `` stacked class 0 data set '' corresponding to 540  ks of chandra acis - i exposure time still giving no indication for a detection . in the absence of detailed information on the absorbing gas column densities or the intrinsic spectral properties ,",
    "an interpretation within an evolutionary scenario is difficult .",
    "the situation is more favorable for more evolved class i protostars although sample statistics are biased by strong x - ray attenuation , favoring detection of the most luminous and the hardest sources .",
    "a comprehensive study is available for the orion region @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosities increase from protostars to tts by about an order of magnitude , although the situation is unknown below 1 - 2  kev .",
    "no significant trend is found for the electron temperatures , which are similarly high ( @xmath013  kev ) for all detected classes .",
    "protostellar hxr detections with simbol - x will be particularly interesting : emission above @xmath12  kev is mostly unabsorbed , permitting unbiased studies of deeply embedded protostars , thus pinpointing the earliest appearance of magnetic activity and high - energy stellar environments .",
    "such observations will also be crucial to understand magnetic energy release in these youngest objects , as discussed below .",
    "magnetic energy release and the ensuing electromagnetic spectrum have been studied in detail for the solar corona @xcite .",
    "the standard flare scenario posits that non - potential coronal magnetic fields reconnect and thus release kinetic and thermal energy .",
    "while traveling along closed magnetic fields and colliding in denser chromospheric layers , accelerated particles emit prompt gyrosynchrotron , optical , and ultraviolet radiation and non - thermal hard x - rays .",
    "the energy deposition explosively heats gas to @xmath110  mk , and the resulting overpressure drives the newly heated gas along the magnetic field lines into the corona .",
    "soft x - rays are emitted by the hot plasma accumulating in coronal loops , with a characteristic delay with respect to the prompt non - thermal emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    hxr emission provides crucial diagnostics for the particle acceleration process in the solar corona and therefore the primary energy release mechanisms ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , yet very little is known about hxr emission from active stars .",
    "detections of a few sources up to several tens of kev with bepposax @xcite turn out to be compatible with the extended thermal spectrum also seen in the sxr range . perhaps the most promising case so far has been reported from swift observations of the active binary ii peg @xcite . during a giant flare ,",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum up to at least 100  kev is compatible with a power - law electron distribution although a thermal , very hot maxwellian distribution can not be excluded .",
    "there is ample complementary evidence for non - thermal electron populations in stellar coronae , including young stellar objects .",
    "radio gyrosynchrotron emission has been detected in many active stars during flares and quiescent periods ; the quiescent radio emission correlates with the quiescent sxr radiation , suggesting a causal relation between particle acceleration and heating in the same way as in solar flares @xcite .",
    "this would suggest the presence of continuous hxr emission as well , as discussed below .",
    "high - energy electrons are also capable of ejecting inner - shell electrons in cool gas , producing the analog of fluorescent emission induced by photon irradiation .",
    "although the 6.4  kev line of `` cold iron '' occasionally detected in young stellar objects may indeed be from fluorescence in x - ray irradiated circumstellar disks , new evidence suggests a role for electron impact , both in giant flares in evolved stars @xcite and in a protostellar flare in which the 6.4  kev line peaked during the rise phase of the soft x - rays @xcite .    simbol - x will clarify these issues in detail .",
    "[ fig2]a shows a spectral simulation of the ii peg flare @xcite as if it had occurred at the distance of the orion nebula , exposed for 3  ks .",
    "the power - law tail suggested by @xcite is included in the model and dominates all emission above @xmath030  kev .",
    "although such giant flares are exceedingly rare on an individual star , a cluster with @xmath13 young stars such as the orion nebula cluster may offer a realistic chance for simbol - x to study several such events .",
    "solar observations show evidence for small - scale flare events occurring in the corona at any time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "their distribution in energy follows a power law , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of flares per unit time with a total energy ( thermal or radiated ) in the interval [ @xmath16 .",
    "if the power - law index @xmath17 is @xmath18 , then the energy integration @xmath19 ( assuming @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the last approximation ) diverges for @xmath22 , i.e. , by extrapolating the power law to sufficiently small flare energies , _ any _ energy release power can be attained @xcite .",
    "solar studies have repeatedly resulted in @xmath17 values on the order of 1.61.8 for ordinary solar flares",
    "@xcite although some statistical investigations suggest @xmath23 for small flares in the quiet solar corona @xcite .",
    "stellar studies in the euv or soft x - ray range have predominantly converged to @xmath17 between 2 and 3 , and this is specifically true for large samples of pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    an ultimate test of this model would be the detection of continuous hard , non - thermal x - ray emission that should accompany the energy release diagnosed so far in the soft x - ray range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "i propose in the following a method to estimate the non - thermal hard x - ray production based on some basic relations derived from the sun and magnetically active stars . for a complementary discussion and application",
    ", i refer to @xcite and @xcite .    the constant @xmath24 in eqns .",
    "and can be found from observations of the flare occurrence rate in young , magnetically active stars .",

    "note that @xmath25 is proportional to the average soft x - ray luminosity @xmath6 of the star .",
    "_ solar _ soft x - ray flares are accompanied by non - thermal hard x - rays .",
    "the respective peak fluxes @xmath30 and @xmath31 are correlated albeit in a non - linear way @xcite : @xmath32 with @xmath33 @xcite or @xmath34 @xcite . as @xmath30 refers to",
    "the 1.6 - 12.4  kev channel of the geostationary operational environmental satellites ( goes ) , a conversion to the broader soft x - ray range of , say , 0.3 - 10  kev , is needed ; for typical spectra of classical tts , the goes flux is about @xmath35 times the total soft x - ray flux . converting the non - linear relation for measured fluxes at earth to luminosities of the solar corona , one has@xmath36 where @xmath37 ( cgs ) from the @xcite study . the effective observation of ( quasi- ) continuous sxr or hxr emission records the total radiated energy @xmath38 , @xmath39 integrated in time from each flare rather than their peak luminosities .",
    "introducing a characteristic decay time @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the soft and hard flare light curve so that @xmath42 , one finds for the _ average _ power in hard x - rays @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the lowest flare energy required .",
    "it can be found by noting that the corresponding @xmath45 and that the integration of the _ soft _ energies should ( according to the flare hypothesis ) equal the average soft x - ray luminosity , @xmath6 , from which @xmath46^{1/(-\\alpha+2)}.\\ ] ] after some further manipulations , one finds @xmath47 using parameters from @xcite ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath35 , @xmath49 and reasonable decay times of @xmath50  s and @xmath51  s ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , one finds @xmath52 .",
    "note that in the work by @xcite , the hard x - ray flux is `` per kev '' at 35  kev .",
    "the total hard emission above @xmath2  kev could reasonably be a factor of perhaps 50 higher , i.e. @xmath53    note that @xmath54 despite the non - linearities between flare peak powers in sxr and hxr , although the ( different ) flare decay times become important",
    ". the expected radiation may be easily detectable with simbol - x from young stellar clusters if a sufficient number of stars ( each assumed to produce equal emission ) contribute .",

    "hard radiation can be detected up to 100  kev .",
