    "absorption line indices in the visual as defined by the lick group ( e.g. , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , fe5270 , fe5335 , etc .",
    ", @xcite ) have proven to be a useful tool for the derivation of ages and metallicities of unresolved stellar populations .",
    "one of the largest merits of the lick indices is to have signaled the presence of non - solar mg / fe abundance ratios in the stars of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed empirically by the similarity between the lick indices of early - type galaxies and those of bulge globular clusters @xcite , which are known from spectroscopy of individual stars to be mg / fe enhanced .    indeed the indices @xmath4/@xmath5  and fe5270/fe5335 are dominated by absorption lines from the elements mg and fe , and model atmosphere calculations by @xcite and @xcite have theoretically demonstrated that these indices are sensitive to mg / fe abundance ratios . following an extension of the method introduced by @xcite , we have used the calculations of @xcite to produce stellar population models with variable element abundance ratios ( @xcite , hereafter tmb03 ) .",
    "these models are now able to match simultaneously the mg and fe line indices of globular clusters and early - type galaxies .    the balmer line index @xmath2 , which is used as age indicator because it measures the presence of warm a - type stars , is only moderately contaminated by metallic lines and therefore relatively insensitive to abundance ratio variations ( * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* tmb03 ) . does this convenient attribute of @xmath2  apply also to the higher - order balmer line indices @xmath0  and @xmath1  defined in @xcite ?",
    "the comparison of the predictions from solar - scaled stellar population models with galactic globular cluster data shows that the effect from @xmath3-enhancement must be small in a metallicity range up to solar @xcite .",
    "there are several good reasons for serious doubts , however , that this is the case also at super - solar metallicities .",
    "1 ) from data in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) it can be seen that the higher - order balmer line indices and @xmath2  lead to very inconsistent age estimates .",
    "2 ) the @xmath1  measurements of early - type galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey can not be reproduced by current solar - scaled stellar population models @xcite .",
    "3 ) both @xmath0  and @xmath1  have very prominent fe absorption features in their pseudo - continua .",
    "@xcite have not included @xmath0  and @xmath1 , however , so that a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of these line indices to abundance ratios in stellar population models was not possible until now .",
    "since these line indices are already being widely used and will certainly supersede @xmath2  as age indicators in future studies at intermediate and high - redshifts , it is urgent to clarify this issue . to this aim in korn et al .",
    "( in preparation ) we have extended the @xcite approach and computed model atmosphere calculations with variable abundance ratios including the wavelengths of the higher - order balmer lines ( @xmath6 ) . in this paper",
    "we present the resulting stellar population models of @xmath0  and @xmath1  with different @xmath3  ratios , which are computed following the recipe of tmb03 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we will briefly introduce the stellar population model , and calibrate it with galactic globular clusters . in section  3",
    "we shall confront the new models with data of elliptical galaxies focusing on the issues outlined above .",
    "we will conclude with section  4 .",
    "tmb03 present stellar population models with different chemical mixtures and element abundance ratios . all optical lick indices from @xmath7",
    "to @xmath8  @xcite in the wavelength range @xmath9 are computed for various chemical mixtures modifying the abundance ratios between @xmath10-elements ( e.g. , o , mg , si , ti etc . ) , iron peak elements ( fe , cr ) , and the individual elements carbon , nitrogen , and calcium @xcite .",
    "the models are based on the evolutionary population synthesis of @xcite .",
    "the impact from element ratio changes is computed with the help of the @xcite model atmosphere calculations , using an extension of the method introduced by @xcite .",
    "we refer to tmb03 for more details .",
    "we have performed model atmosphere calculations based on the code mafags @xcite in a large range of metallicities from 1/200 to 3.5 times solar , as presented and described in detail in korn et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "recently defined absorption line indices like the higher - order balmer lines @xcite or the ca@xmath11ii triplet @xcite are not included .",
    "our new model atmosphere and line formation calculations allow us to explore abundance ratio effects on any index definition . here",
    "we very briefly summarize the main results found for the higher - order balmer line indices @xmath0  and @xmath1 , relevant for this paper .",
    "we first calculated model atmospheres with solar - scaled element ratios for various combinations of temperature , gravity , and total metallicity . in subsequent models",
    "we double in turn the abundances of the elements c , n , o , mg , fe , ca , na , si , cr , and ti . we find that higher - order balmer line indices , unlike @xmath2 , are sensitive to element abundance variations .",
    "more specifically , all four indices , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , show significant positive responses to the elements mg and si , and significant negative responses to fe , c , and ti .",
    "the latter are caused by the presence of absorption lines in the pseudo - continua of the absorption index .",
    "these sensitivities increase with total metallicity because of the increasing strengths of the metallic lines , and virtually disappear at low metallicities .      in the tmb03 models ,",
    "the @xmath3-enhanced chemical mix at fixed total metallicity is obtained by balancing the increased abundance of the enhanced group with a decrease of the abundances of the elements fe and cr ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the former contains the so - called @xmath10-elements o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , ti ( particles that are build up with @xmath10-particle nuclei ) plus the elements n and na . the abundance of c ( formally also an @xmath10-particle ) is assumed not to vary ( see tmb03 for more details ) . as the enhanced group dominates by far the total metal abundance ( mostly because o is the most abundant metal ) , an enhancement of the @xmath3  ratio at fixed total metallicity is characterized mainly by a decrease in the abundances of fe and cr .",
    "hence , even though relative variations of the element abundances within the enhanced group exist in early - type galaxies @xcite , these do not significantly affect the @xmath3  ratio .",
    "this implies that the negative responses of the higher - order balmer line indices to fe abundance as reported above will dominate the behaviour of the indices as a function of the @xmath3  ratio .",
    "a split of the abundance vectors into further components exceeds the scope of this paper and will be subject of future work .",
    "the resulting stellar population models are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : globulars ] , in which we plot the @xmath3-independent index @xmath16^{\\prime}$ ]  ( see tmb03 ) vs.  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15  as functions of total metallicity , for the abundance ratios @xmath17=0.0,\\ 0.3,\\ 0.5 $ ] ( see lables ) , and a fixed age of @xmath18gyr . at high metallicities ,",
    "the models show a very prominent dependence of all four higher - order balmer line indices on the @xmath3  ratio .",
    "this @xmath3-sensitivity disappears at low metallicities , because of the general weakness of fe and other metal absorption lines .    the effect at high metallicity amounts to the order of a couple of angstroms .",
    "it is caused by the presence of a large number of iron lines , the strongest being fe@xmath11i lines at @xmath19  in the blue and at 4383 and @xmath20  in the red pseudo - continua .",
    "the most prominent fe@xmath11i lines in the index definitions of @xmath14and @xmath15  are at 4045   ( only @xmath14 ) , 4064 and 4072@xmath11  in the blue pseudo - continuum .",
    "the red pseudo - continuum of the narrower index @xmath15  contains fe@xmath11i lines at 4119 and 4132@xmath11 , the red pseudo - continuum of @xmath14  includes the lines at 4132 and 4144@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0  seems generally slightly less affected , as this index has fe and cr lines at 4326 and 4352 within the absorption feature , which may counter - balance the effect from the iron lines in the continuum windows .    in case of both @xmath0  and @xmath1 ,",
    "the narrower index definitions are less sensitive to abundance ratio variations .",
    "it is obvious that the narrower the definition of an index , the less it is affected by contamination from additional metallic lines .",
    "there is a price to pay , however .",
    "narrower indices require significantly higher signal - to - noise ratios @xcite , which becomes very expensive in terms of telescope time , and seriously hinders their use for galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "the solar - scaled stellar population models of the higher - order balmer line indices are presented and compared with globular cluster data in @xcite .",
    "because of their weak sensitivity to @xmath3  ratios at metallicities below solar ( see section  [ sec : newmodel ] ) , the solar - scaled models reproduce very well the data of globular clusters up to solar metallicity ( for the comparison at young ages see @xcite ) . here",
    "we check whether also the new models , with the effect of @xmath3-enhancement included , are consistent with the globular cluster data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : globulars ] , which is analogous to fig .  13 in @xcite , globular clusters @xcite are plotted as circles .",
    "it is known from high - resolution spectroscopy of individual stars in galactic globular clusters that these are @xmath3-enhanced by typically a factor 2 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the model can therefore be considered well calibrated , at least for old ages , if the data are reproduced by the model with @xmath17=0.3 $ ] .",
    "the proper modelling of balmer line indices requires the calibration of the horizontal branch morphology ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "various morphologies of the horizontal branch in the models are considered , that reproduce the data with their observed horizontal branches . since this issue is fully discussed there , in fig .",
    "[ fig : globulars ] we plot only the model which best reproduces the average trend of the balmer line indices as a function of metallicity .",
    "the open symbols are clusters that have relatively red horizontal branches for their metallicity , and it is shown in @xcite that these objects are well matched by models in which less mass loss along the red giant branch is adopted .",
    "our model predictions should therefore be compared with the filled data points .",
    "hence , the models can be considered well calibrated .",
    "to conclude , as the sensitivity of @xmath0  and @xmath1  to @xmath3  disappears at low metallicities and is still relatively small around solar metallicity , both the solar - scaled and the @xmath3-enhanced models are consistent with the globular cluster data .",
    "the effect of the @xmath3  ratio on the higher - order balmer line indices increases significantly with metallicity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : globulars ] ) , so that a noticeable impact is to be expected on the derivation of ages for metal - rich systems like elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxies ] , in which we plot the balmer line indices @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath2  of elliptical galaxies from the fornax cluster @xcite versus their @xmath16^{\\prime}$ ]  indices .",
    "overlayed are solar - scaled ( dotted lines ) and @xmath3-enhanced ( solid lines ) model grids for ages from 3 to 15@xmath11gyr and total metallicities [ @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see labels ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the elliptical galaxy data of @xcite are particularly appropriate for the purpose of this paper , as the sample displays an amazingly small spread in @xmath3  ratio ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxies ] and text below ) .",
    "this allows us to show only one @xmath3-enhanced model grid , which considerably eases the illustration of the effect of the @xmath3ratio on the age determination .      when interpreted with the solar - scaled models , the three balmer line indices yield dramatically discrepant age",
    "estimates : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath2  indicate average ages for the fornax ellipticals of about 3 , 8 , and 10@xmath24gyr , respectively . in line with the different ages ,",
    "also inconsistent metallicities are obtained from the various balmer lines , @xmath12  leading to the highest values .",
    "ngc@xmath111399 ( see label ) is not even covered by the solar - scaled models for @xmath12  and @xmath13 implying metallicities well above @xmath25=0.67 $ ] in extrapolation .      however , from their mg and fe indices , we know that the @xcite ellipticals are all @xmath3-enhanced with @xmath17\\sim 0.2 $ ] on the average as shown in the bottom right - hand panel of fig .  [ fig : galaxies ] ( only ngc@xmath111399 has a slightly higher @xmath3 ) .",
    "hence , the appropriate model to be used is the @xmath3-enhanced model with @xmath17\\sim 0.2 $ ] shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxies ] .",
    "these models predict substantially larger ( up to 1@xmath24 ) @xmath12 , still significantly larger @xmath13 , and only moderately larger @xmath2  indices than the solar - scaled ones . as a consequence ,",
    "the severe age discrepancies obtained on the basis of the solar - scaled model are eliminated . when interpreted with the @xmath3-enhanced model ,",
    "the age and metallicity estimates from @xmath2and @xmath13  now agree amazingly well .",
    "we find the ages to scatter between 10 and 15@xmath24gyr with metallicities between one and two times solar .",
    "the same good agreement holds also for ngc@xmath111399 . to demonstrate this , we plot as the open circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxies ] the model prediction with the three parameters @xmath26gyr , @xmath25=0.58 $ ] and @xmath17=0.38 $ ] , which reproduces well ( within the errors ) all six absorption line indices .",
    "the agreement with @xmath12  is less compelling , even though the situation has clearly improved with respect to the solar - scaled model .",
    "the age estimates are roughly consistent within the errors , but we still obtain systematically younger ages from @xmath12  than from @xmath2  and @xmath13",
    ". this might be due to an underestimation of the index responses drawn from our model atmosphere calculations ( korn et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "however , it can not be excluded that the fitting functions for @xmath12  are in error at metallicities above solar owing to bad input stellar data , or that calibration offsets are present in the galaxy data .",
    "the former caution can expect clarification , when in future index response functions of the higher - order balmer lines from other groups will be available @xcite . to conclude , at this point it is certainly safer to use the narrower definition @xmath13 , if the cost in signal - to - noise is bearable .",
    "the content of this paper strongly impacts on some results reported in the literature , which have been obtained by using higher - order balmer line indices as age indicators . in the previous sections ,",
    "we have extensively discussed the interpretation of the @xcite sample .",
    "a further example is the work by @xcite , who analyze the @xmath12  and @xmath14  indices of a sample of @xmath27 coma galaxies . interpreting the data with solar - scaled stellar population models",
    ", they find relatively young ages for early - type cluster galaxies between 3 and 5@xmath11gyr , and in particular they find the trend that more luminous objects tend to be younger .",
    "however , a well - defined correlation between @xmath3-enhancement and galaxy mass is found for early - type galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , both the young ages and the anti - correlation between age and galaxy luminosity disappear , when the effect from @xmath3  ratios on the higher - order balmer line indices is taken into account .    as a further example ,",
    "@xcite have recently measured absorption line indices of early - type spectra from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "they find severe inconsistencies between several line indices .",
    "both @xmath2  and @xmath5  can not be matched simultaneously with the higher - order balmer line index @xmath14  by solar - scaled stellar population models for any age - metallicity combination .",
    "this problem is caused , at least partially , by abundance ratios effects and can be resolved with the models presented in this paper .",
    "we have shown that @xmath14  increases by several angstroms when the @xmath3  ratio is doubled .",
    "note that a more quantitative comparison is not possible , because the data presented in @xcite are not strictly calibrated on the lick system .",
    "it has also been noticed in the literature that early - type galaxy data are better matched by the solar - scaled models , when higher - order balmer line indices are plotted as functions of fe indices ( fe4383 , fe5270 ) instead ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the models presented here we know",
    "now that this apparent consistency between data and models is merely the consequence of two compensating effects : the increase of the higher - order balmer line indices owing to the @xmath3  enhancement is balanced by a decrease of the fe line indices , which conspires to locate the data on the model grid .",
    "we have extended our models of absorption line indices of stellar populations with variable abundance ratios ( tmb03 ) to the higher - order balmer line indices @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we show that the model predictions are well consistent with data of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the key result of this work is that , unlike @xmath2 , all four indices show a marked dependence on the @xmath3  ratio .",
    "the significance of this effect increases with increasing metallicity , and therefore impacts on the age derivation for elliptical galaxies .",
    "re - analyzing the elliptical galaxy sample of @xcite , we show that @xmath2  and @xmath13  ( and a bit less convincingly also @xmath12 ) yield consistent age estimates if ( and only if ) the effect of @xmath3  enhancement is taken into account .",
    "a posteriori , it is not surprising that blue absorption line indices are more affected by abundance ratio effects , because of the presence of more metallic lines in the bluer parts of the spectrum .",
    "this fact certainly diminishes the advantage of the higher - order balmer line indices over @xmath2  as age indicators , in spite of their lower sensitivity to emission line filling .",
    "the consequence for the age derivation by means of @xmath0  and @xmath1  is twofold : 1 ) the element ratio effect on the balmer line indices needs to be taken into account in the models .",
    "2 ) the additional knowledge of the @xmath3  ratio is necessary , which requires the simultaneous measurement of @xmath5  and fe5270/fe5335 .",
    "if these wavelengths are not accessible , as typically the case for intermediate and high - redshift data , @xmath3  ratios may be best estimated from the indices fe4383 and @xmath7  or @xmath28 .",
    "model tables are listed in the appendix and are available electronically under http://www.mpe.mpg.de/@xmath29dthomas .",
