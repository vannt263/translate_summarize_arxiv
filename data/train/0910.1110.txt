    "rxte_-pca monitoring light curve in fact showed a higher , more average flux level until roughly 300 days before the _ suzaku _ observation ( figure 7 ) .",
    "a final possibility that does not require evolution in @xmath126 is that the inner disk may have become be too ionized to transmit an fe line . in the context of models with a hot , ionized skin ( nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ) , a disk illuminated by a power - law continuum with a photon index near 1.6 , similar to that in the _ suzaku _ observation , yields extremely weak fe line emission .    of course , both profile models are likely oversimplifications .",
    "the community could thus benefit from an x - ray observatory with @xmath1 few ev resolution combined with a large effective area near 6 kev to resolve the various components of the fe k@xmath0 core as a function of time and/or continuum flux level , if multiple components do indeed exist , as well as resolve the line .",
    "a compton shoulder was not significantly detected in either the _ suzaku _ or _ xmm - newton _ spectra ; we find upper limits to compton shoulder emission ( first - scattering ) of @xmath123@xmath27 of the core .",
    "it is thus not obvious from this limit alone whether bulk of the fe k@xmath0 line originates in compton - thick material , especially the degree to which the strength of the compton shoulder depends on the geometry of the material .",
    "however , no relativistically broadened fe k@xmath0 line has been confirmed in ngc 4593 , but we confirm from the broadband _ suzaku _ spectrum the presence of a compton reflection hump which thus must correspond to ( at least some fraction of ) the fe k@xmath0 core emission .",
    "we can investigate if the measured strength @xmath6 of the compton reflection hump , @xmath154 ( statistical uncertainty only ; @xmath9 0.35 including the systematic uncertainty ) , can correspond to the observed fe k@xmath0 line @xmath58 of 255@xmath919 ev .",
    "following george & fabian ( 1991 ) , one expects an @xmath58 of 135 ev ( using the abundances of lodders 2003 ) to correspond to @xmath6 = 1 for an semi - infinite optically thick slab illuminated by a power - law continuum with @xmath82 = 1.7 and assuming solar abundances and an inclination angle of 30@xmath55 relative to the observer s line of sight .",
    "the observed values of @xmath6 and @xmath58 are thus consistent if the fe abundance relative to solar , @xmath90 , is about 1.7 , which is not unreasonable . for a truncated disk , this",
    "could be explained by having the comptonizing corona consist of numerous flares lying in a sandwich - like geometry just above / below the thin disk ( e.g. , haardt et al .",
    "1994 ) , such that the disk spans 2@xmath15 sr of the sky as seen by each x - ray flare",
    ". however , very distant ( pc - scale ) , compton - thick material lying out of the line of sight , which can not be ruled out as contributing to the observed fe k emission profile , could also contribute to the total compton reflection strength .",
    "however , if the thin disk is truncated , then a semi - infinite slab may not be an appropriate geometry , especially if the central x - ray source is not immediately close to the reflecting disk .",
    "the @xmath58 of a truncated disk will be lower , but will depend on the location of the illuminating x - ray source .",
    "if we assume that the illuminating x - ray source is located on the disk symmetry axis a height @xmath155 above the disk , we can use the @xmath58 to constrain @xmath155 .",
    "george & fabian ( 1991 , their fig .",
    "15 ) demonstrate that the reflected flux is dominated by the region of the disk with @xmath156 12 .",
    "for a truncated thin disk with @xmath126 = several thousand @xmath4 , @xmath155 must also be @xmath1 several thousand @xmath4 above the black hole . a configuration in which the x - ray corona is associated with the base of a jet along the symmetry axis",
    "may thus be applicable , e.g. , markoff , nowak & wilms ( 2005 ) .",
    "ngc 4593 , like many seyferts , is known to host a pc - scale radio component ( size of @xmath3915 pc ; schmitt et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the primary - law component in seyfert x - ray spectra is usually attributed to inverse comptonization of soft seed photons . in an adaf flow , thermal comptonization",
    "is expected to dominate the x - ray emission unless the accretion rate is extremely low , in which case thermal bremsstrahlung emission dominates the x - ray spectrum ( narayan et al .  1998 , narayan 2005 ) .",
    "one of our main results is that while the primary power - law component has dropped in flux by a factor of almost 4 , the soft excess has dropped in flux by a factor of @xmath120 between 2002 and 2007 , ruling out an origin for the soft excess with a size greater than 5 lt - years .",
    "this drop is likely linked to the decrease in the primary x - ray power - law , i.e. , it may be either a cause of an effect of it .",
    "we explored two phenomenological models for the soft excess , bremsstrahlung and thermal comptonization . in the presence of an adaf flow",
    ", one can expect thermal bremsstrahlung emission with a temperature of @xmath157 k ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , but such temperatures are higher by over 2 orders of magnitude compared to the temperature derived from our model fits and by b07 .",
    "we also modeled the soft excess as inverse comptonization of soft seed photons with an assumed input temperature of 50 ev by an optically thin corona with a temperature @xmath158 kev , again obtaining similar results to b07 .",
    "the location of such a process is not clear , though it could occur in the ionized skin of the thin disk ( e.g. , magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 , janiuk et al .",
    "2001 ) , or at the base of an outflowing jet .",
    "if both the soft excess and hard x - ray power - law components originate via comptonization of disk seed photons , a decrease in the intensity of those soft seed photons ( e.g. , from an increase in @xmath126 ) between 2002 and 2007 could yield a correlated drop in both component s flux .",
    "another possibility is that the optical depth of the comptonizing components may have changed .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the _ suzaku _ satellite , a collaborative mission between the space agencies of japan ( jaxa ) and the usa ( nasa ) .",

    "<S> the _ suzaku _ observation caught the source in a low - flux state ; comparison to a 2002 _ xmm - newton _ observation indicates that the hard x - ray flux decreased by 3.6 , while the fe k@xmath0 line intensity and width @xmath5 each roughly halved . </S>",
    "<S> two model - dependent explanations for the changes in fe k@xmath0 line profile are explored . in one , </S>",
    "<S> the fe k@xmath0 line width has decreased from @xmath110000 to @xmath14000 km s@xmath2 from 2002 to 2007 , suggesting that the thin disk truncation / transition radius has increased from 10002000 to @xmath35000 @xmath4 . however , there are indications from other compact accreting systems that such truncation radii tend to be associated only with accretion rates relative to eddington much lower than that of ngc 4593 . in the second model , </S>",
    "<S> the line profile in the _ xmm - newton _ observation consists of a time - invariant narrow component plus a broad component originating from the inner part of the truncated disk ( @xmath1300 @xmath4 ) which has responded to the drop in continuum flux . </S>",
    "<S> the compton reflection component strength @xmath6 is @xmath1 1.1 , consistent with the measured fe k@xmath0 line total equivalent width with an fe abundance 1.7 times the solar value . </S>",
    "<S> the modest soft excess , modeled well by either thermal bremsstrahlung emission or by comptonization of soft seed photons in an optical thin plasma , has fallen by a factor of @xmath120 from 2002 to 2007 , ruling out emission from a region 5 lt - yr in size . </S>"
