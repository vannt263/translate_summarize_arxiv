    "derived radial velocity ( rv ) dispersion ( @xmath9 ) profiles for dsphs tend to remain rather flat to well past the core radius . @xcite attempted to fit the flat draco ( dra ) dsph profile using two - parameter spherical models ( @xcite ) that yield increasing @xmath10 with radius and a net @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite , applying a constant anisotropy parameter model to the @xmath9 profiles of the fornax and dra dsphs , derived @xmath13 @xmath5 masses for these two systems .",
    "cosmology - dependent studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) based on @xmath14cdm models interpret the flat @xmath9 profiles as consistent with massive dm halos surrounding luminous cores .",
    "this interpretation helps alleviate the `` missing satellites '' problem ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) endemic to these cosmologies .",
    "mw tidal effects on dsphs have also been considered ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; m05 ) with predictions of potentially significant unbound stellar populations producing flat / rising dsph @xmath9 profiles .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently reported flat or slightly rising @xmath9 profiles that suddenly decline near the @xmath1 of the dra , ursa minor ( umi ) and sextans dsphs .",
    "such widely separated cold populations in dsphs are of interest because they have been interpreted as signs of _ mild _ tidal disruption , but more importantly , because they severely mitigate against the idea of extended , heated populations around dsphs ( @xcite ) .",
    "how far dsphs really extend as well as the bound versus unbound nature of putative `` extratidal '' components remains unanswered .",
    "spectroscopic observation of dsph - associated stars beyond @xmath1 is thus important to confirm the reality of the extended populations and to ascertain their dynamical state .    in this",

    "( 3 ) a cold population at @xmath1 for one of the dsphs is found only under certain binning schemes , and furthermore , depends on how one defines outliers (  5 ) .",
    "( 4 ) the washington+@xmath16 method is at least 5 times more efficient at finding _ bona fide _ dsph members than color magnitude diagram ( cmd)-selection schemes (  4 ) .",
    "previous contributions in this series ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p03 ) ; @xcite ) show that washington@xmath0 photometry effectively identifies rare dsph giant star members against the high milky way foreground in the low density wings of dsphs ( see  4 ) .",
    "we use a similar methodology here , where giant star candidates are first selected within the two - color diagram ( 2cd ) boundary shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the umi photometry is from @xcite supplemented with similar mosaic camera data along the northeast umi major axis taken with the mayall 4-meter telescope on ut 2002 may 4 - 6 .",
    "the dra photometry was obtained with the minimosaic ( minimo ) camera and wiyn telescope on ut 2004 march 12 - 13 and 2005 april 16 - 19 .",
    "minimo s field of view is not optimal for large area photometric surveys ; these data were taken as a backup project when the instrument for our primary observing program failed . as a consequence",
    "we only partially surveyed dra , covering a total area of @xmath17 deg@xmath18 .",
    "median photometric errors for this dataset are @xmath19 ( 0.014 , 0.014 , 0.018 ) at @xmath20    we have been unable to obtain spectroscopic follow - up of dra giant candidates identified with our photometry .",
    "however , m. wilkinson graciously provided the @xcite rv database for 416 and 266 observed stars in the directions of the dra and umi dsphs , respectively .",
    "typical rv errors for these data are 2.4 ( dra ) and @xmath21 ( umi ) .",
    "we cross - identify by celestial coordinates 254 umi field stars ( 95% ) but only 212 dra field stars ( 51% ) between the w04 and our databases .",

    "we deliberately targeted umi giant candidates at large radii .",
    "the spectra were reduced with standard iraf echelle reduction methodology with rvs determined using the fxcor package on the mg triplet ( @xmath22 ) order .",
    "our quoted rv errors are determined as in @xcite with a median of @xmath23 , calibrated by 19 multiple measures of six different umi stars . for nine stars in common with @xcite",
    "we obtain a mean rv difference of @xmath24 with dispersion of only @xmath21 .",
    "the union of our data with that of w04 yields 309 unique rvs for the umi field .",
    "the washington@xmath0 database can be used not only to select dsph giant star candidates _ before _ spectroscopy ( as done here for umi ) but for after - the - fact assessment of likely membership of stars in existing rv catalogues .",
    "figure 1 shows our cmd and 2cd for umi and dra .",
    "filled / open circles designate rv stars more / less likely to be giants based on positions in the 2cd ( with `` giants '' adopted as stars bounded by the thin line ) .",
    "a few stars just outside our giant selection criteria that have an rv consistent with that of the dsph have been considered giants as well .",
    "the `` likely giant stars '' tend to lie closer to the red / asymptotic giant branches of the dsphs than the `` less likely giants '' ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows rvs for all stars versus elliptical radius , @xmath25 , normalized to @xmath26 for umi ( @xcite ) and @xmath27 for dra ( @xcite ) .",
    "an `` elliptical radius '' corresponds to the semi - major radius of the ellipse centered on the dsph that intersects the position of the star and has the measured ellipticity of the dsph ( 0.54 for umi and 0.29 for dra ; from above references ) .",
    "we adopt elliptical rather than circular radii to follow the distribution of stars , although a dsph s gravitational potential and tidal boundary do not necessarily mimic its observed shape ( we revisit circular radii in  5 ) .    the @xcite @xmath28 rejection criterion to discriminate likely dsph members ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) corresponds to @xmath29 around @xmath30 for dra and @xmath31 around @xmath32 for umi . by these criteria ( fig .",
    "2 ) only six of our photometric dra giant candidates lie outside this velocity range , proving the reliability of our photometric discrimination technique . among stars classified as giants by our photometric technique , two ( solid squares in fig .",
    "2 ) lie just outside the rv range at @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( uncertainties within @xmath35 of the  dra member \" rv limit ) . while for @xmath36 dra members one expects only @xmath37 outliers at @xmath38 for a _",
    "gaussian _ distribution , the kurtosis excesses ( @xmath39 ) of _ both _ the dra and umi rv distributions flatten from near gaussian ( @xmath40 ) to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , at @xmath43 , so that more _ apparent _ `` outliers '' might be expected . based on these two arguments and the  giant star \" colors of these two stars",
    "we consider them to be very likely dra members .    in umi ,",
    "a larger number of giant candidates than in dra live clearly outside the rv criteria ( fig .  2 ) . because even the faintest stars with rvs have quite small photometric uncertainties ( @xcite ) , it is not likely that these `` false positives '' are due to photometric error , but rather represent field halo giants or metal - poor dwarf stars with weak mgb+mgh absorption . among the `` non - umi '' giant candidates",
    "there appears to be rv clumpiness , with 9/9/7 stars having @xmath44/@xmath45/@xmath46 around @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "these rv clumps of giant candidates have @xmath9 s of order those observed in umi and dra , as well as in the sagittarius ( sgr ) tidal tails ( @xcite ) and are reminiscent of foreground halo substructure discovered in our similar survey of carina ( m05 ) ; our giant star identification method may be finding _ other _ halo substructure in the umi field .",
    "nevertheless , the majority of stars we photometrically classify as giants do lie inside the @xcite `` umi '' rv range ( see  4 ) . a remaining photometric giant candidate ( _ triangle _ ) lies just outside the umi rv limits but well inside the giant region in the 2cd _ and _ along the rgb locus for umi ; we strongly suspect this star is a umi member and include it in our @xmath9 analysis (  5 ) . in the end ,",
    "182 umi and 210 dra stars are included in our @xmath9 profiles (  5 ) .",
    "particularly at large angular radii , the sky density of dsph stars with brightnesses amenable to current spectroscopic capability ( i.e. , red giants ) is swamped by foreground stars . to improve overall efficiency of target selection , various groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) select dsph targets by position on / near the dsph s giant branch in the cmd .",
    "this typically decreases foreground contamination by an order of magnitude but `` false positive '' sources still well outnumber dsph stars outside @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , our washington@xmath0 photometric technique improves sample reliability by an additional order of magnitude over , for example , the @xcite cmd selection .    over all angular separations ( to @xmath48 in the case of umi ) our technique yields a dsph member identification efficiency of 87% for umi and 97% for dra .",
    "our `` false positive '' identifications all lie beyond @xmath49 ( we ignore the possibility that their rv clumping is due to wrapped umi tidal debris arms , as observed in the sgr system ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite s overall success rate for their cmd - selected candidates , to only @xmath50 for umi and @xmath51 for dra , is 62% and 50% , respectively .",
    "considering targets with @xmath52 , the w04 efficiency drops to 38% ( 28/73 ) and 19% ( 45/239 ) respectively , whereas our selection method at similar radii still nets an overall efficiency of 77% ( 23/30 ) and 85% ( 23/27 ) for umi and dra .",
    "this 2 to 4.5 times greater member selection efficiency optimizes the exploration of low density dsphs galaxies with valuable 6 to 10-m class telescope time .",
    "our @xmath9 profiles are computed using equal sample - size binning , but similar results are found with equal , linear bin sizes ( though some bins are poorly populated in this scheme ) .",
    "the method of @xcite is used to calculate @xmath9 , because a maximum likelihood method like that used by @xcite assumes a gaussian velocity distribution at all radii , which is not observed for either dsph , and is also not expected in a disrupted system ( m05 ) . to assess",
    "the influence of bin size and geometry figure 3 shows the umi dispersion profile versus elliptical ( panel a ) and circular radii ( panel b ) with 17 , 12 and 7 members per bin ( and the outermost bins accumulating any odd , extra star ) .",
    "as expected , profile variability is less pronounced as the number of stars per bin increases .",
    "the general umi trend is an initial decline in @xmath9 followed by a gentle rise and then a slightly decreasing profile .",
    "the sudden decline to a `` cold point '' reported by @xcite appears only in the highest resolution binning that is most susceptible to statistical fluctuations .",
    "while larger samples of stars in the outer regions of dsphs would be helpful , umi seems to share the trend of more or less flat dispersion profiles observed in the outskirts of other dsphs ( @xcite , @xcite , m05 ) .",
    "the dra profiles ( fig .",
    "4 ) use 21 , 16 and 8 stars per bin , with solid circles for the 208 star samples .",
    "open symbols show the outer profiles when the stars marked as squares in figure 2 are included . except for a single bin in the lower profile of panel ( b ) ,",
    "the same general @xmath9 behavior is seen at large radii as in umi : a flat ( or maybe slowly decreasing ) profile ( depending on the binning ) is observed past @xmath1 . in fact , a non - binning test , like the `` one - by - one '' test used by @xcite for sextans , does not show a cold population in the outermost dispersion points for either dsph . moreover , a @xmath53 fit of the @xmath9 distribution to a constant value for both umi and dra shows that there is no evidence that the outermost stars have a @xmath9 that is statistically different from those of stars at smaller projected radii .",
    "tidal disruption can create an unbound stellar population near a dsph .",
    "this seems to be a natural explanation for producing _ both _ the observed extended stellar distributions _ and _ flat / slowly declining velocity dispersion profiles at large radii in dsphs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; m05 ) . while the flat @xmath9 profiles observed in umi and dra have also been modeled by an _",
    "ad hoc _ extended dm halo ( @xcite ) , two additional piece of evidence support a tidal disruption scenario .",
    "first , the observed platykurtic velocity distributions at large radii in both umi and dra more closely match the flattened rv distributions of unbound dsph stars at large radii in detailed n - body tidal disruption simulations ( e.g. m05 ) .",
    "second , our new keck rvs have verified the most widely separated member stars for any dsph other than the tidally disrupting sgr galaxy .",
    "our most separated umi - field star having a umi rv is at a linear distance of @xmath54 ( 4.8 kpc ) and near the minor axis ; this star s elliptical radius of @xmath55 implies a major axis radius of 10.4 kpc if the umi ellipticity is maintained at all radii . assuming a spherical potential for umi , the required mass to keep this star bound to the dsph is @xmath56 , or @xmath57",
    "@xmath5 for a milky way mass within the umi distance ( @xmath58 kpc ) of @xmath59 @xmath5 ( @xcite ) ; this translates to @xmath60 @xmath7 when we adopt @xmath61 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the tidal boundary of umi is more elongated , a larger @xmath10 is implied ; at the limit where the tidal boudary is elongated according to its central ellipticity , this star , were it placed at its corresponding major axis radius ( i.e. , @xmath62 or 10.4 kpc ) , implies an astounding umi @xmath63 @xmath7 for umi .",
    "it might be argued that the latter star is a field halo interloper , since its rv is only @xmath64 km s@xmath65 ( to the retrograde side ) of that expected for a non - rotating halo ( assuming a 232 km s@xmath65 solar rotation about the galactic center ) and within the @xmath66 of a hot mw halo ( @xmath67 km s@xmath65 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "higher @xmath68 spectroscopy to test this star s chemical properties would be useful . however , under the above mw dynamics , the second most separated  rv member \"  at @xmath3 ( 4 kpc ) , or @xmath69 along the umi major axis  is retrograde by @xmath70 km @xmath65 .",
    "a umi - bound star at this projected radius implies a umi mass @xmath71 @xmath5 or @xmath72 @xmath7 .",
    "one could use a milky way model , like the besancon model ( @xmath73 ) to estimate the expected milky way background ; this model predicts @xmath74 mw halo giants in the range of rv , color and magnitude of the present 9.7 deg@xmath75 umi survey area outside @xmath76 , under the assumption that we have observed _ all _ possible targets in the field , whereas we have only observed 37% ( implying about 1 interloper in our @xmath77 rv sample ) .",
    "however , the besancon model uses smooth population density laws to describe _ mean _ densities and does not account for second order substructure perturbations . in the case",
    "that our color - color - magnitude - rv sampling of parameter space happens to be dominated by a substructure  void \" , the besancon model background should be an overestimate .",
    "were our sampling instead _ overpopulated _ by substructure , the model would underestimate the background .",
    "but the presence of the substructure should be obvious by coherence in our parameter space , while , for there to be interlopers within our umi sample , these stars would have to both lie at roughly the umi distance ( to share position in the cmd and 2cd ) and have about the umi rv  a situation we consider improbable .",
    "moreover , the besancon model in fact _ overpredicts _ by @xmath78 the number of milky way stars we see _ outside _ the umi rv - member range ; accounting for this factor , in the limit of a smooth halo , implies only 0.5 milky way contaminants within the umi rv sample . in the end , we regard as unlikely that _ both _ of the outermost umi rv members are contaminants .",
    "if either of these outer dsph stars are bound , umi has the largest @xmath10 of any galaxy by yet _ another _ order of magnitude _ or two _ than previously suggested .",
    "the corresponding physical dimensions of umi would rival the king profile extent of the sgr density distribution , of which a significant fraction , however , has been shown must be _ unbound _ ( @xcite ) . from the extreme physical dimensions",
    "implied it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that true extratidal stars have now been identified for the umi system  results consistent with suggestions of tidal disruption of this dsph by photometric analyses as early as that of @xcite and more recently by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the existence of shared photometric and rv trends between umi and dra to at least @xmath1 points to a possible tidal disruption scenario for dra as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
