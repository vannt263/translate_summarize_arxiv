    "the emc effect can be interpreted as a modification of quark and gluon distributions in bound nucleons by the nuclear environment .",
    "the dependences of these nuclear modifications on kinematics and various nuclear properties like mass , density or radius are meanwhile rather well known , nevertheless the origin of the effect is still not fully understood .",
    "recent data , discussed in section [ xlargerone ] , provide new important input .    in my opinion further measurements of the effect in electron - nucleus , neutrino - nucleus and proton - nucleus scattering",
    "are needed to determine nuclear quark and gluon distributions ( npdfs ) down to very low parton momentum fractions @xmath1 and to constrain the initial state for the @xmath2 program at rhic and lhc , or for the correct interpretation of , e.g. , ( future ) @xmath3 experiments .",
    "nuclear modifications of parton distributions have been studied mainly by measurements of cross sections in deep - inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering . for electromagnetic interactions of charged leptons with nuclear targets and in the approximation of one - photon exchange",

    "the variable @xmath8 denotes , in the target rest frame , the virtual - photon energy @xmath9 with respect to the lepton - beam energy @xmath10 .    at leading order in qcd",

    "subsequently , we will always discuss the ratio of structure functions ( cross sections ) per nucleon for a nucleus with mass number @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath22 nucleons ) and the deuteron @xmath23 .",
    "the latter is , to a good approximation , equal to the proton - neutron averaged structure function @xmath24 .",

    "this behavior is dominantly a kinematic effect since the free - nucleon cross section vanishes for @xmath64 .",

    ", only the main ideas of some classes of models will be summarized without a discussion why and where they fail to reproduce the data correctly .      the first class of models deals with the shadowing region .",
    "the term ` shadowing ' has been introduced to explain the reduction of the nuclear cross sections in photoproduction , but has then also been used in the discussion of the low-@xmath1 modification of the nuclear cross section in inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "there are two possibilities to explain this phenomenon . in the first approach",
    "the parton distributions in bound nucleons remain unchanged compared to those in the free nucleon .",
    "the interaction is viewed in the rest system of the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear effects are attributed to a modification of the interaction of the virtual photon with the atomic nucleus by fluctuations of the virtual photon into quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "such a pair then interacts with the nucleus via the _ strong _ interaction .",
    "since the strength of the latter is much larger than the electromagnetic one , the interaction does no longer happen incoherently with all the nucleons in the nucleus but preferentially with those at the front surface .",
    "the nucleons being in the ` shadow ' of the nucleons at the front surface then do not or much less contribute to the cross section .",
    "quantitatively this happens , when the fluctuation length @xmath129 is larger than the mean free path @xmath130 of the quark - antiquark pair , i.e. , for @xmath1 below @xmath131 .    in the second approach",
    "the effect is attributed to a modification of the quark and gluon distributions in the nucleus .",
    "the interaction of the virtual photon with the nucleus is viewed in a fast moving system , where the nucleon with diameter @xmath23 is lorentz contracted to a disc of thickness @xmath132 and the mean nucleon distance @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "the longitudinal position of its constituents , however , has an uncertainty of @xmath135 . at small values of @xmath1",
    "this uncertainty @xmath59 can be much larger than @xmath136 and in a nucleus much larger than @xmath137 .",
    "for @xmath138 there will be a spatial overlap of sea quarks and gluons of different nucleons .",
    "the smaller @xmath1 , the larger is the number of nucleons sharing their contents of sea - quarks and gluons .",
    "the effect increases with increasing mass number @xmath104 and saturates for @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the diameter of the nucleus in its rest frame .",
    "thus , the density of gluons and sea quarks at the position of a nucleon in a nucleus can be much larger than for a free nucleon . due to this ` overcrowding ' the probability for an interaction between sea quarks and gluons is increased and by pair annihilation their density is reduced again , resulting in the observed reduction of the nuclear structure function .",
    "momentum conservation requires that this reduction of the number of partons at low values of @xmath1 gets compensated by an enhancement at larger @xmath1 , i. e. , anti - shadowing .    both approaches for shadowing are equivalent .",
    "they describe the same phenomenon but viewed in a different reference frame .",
    "more details can be found , e. g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .      in the second class of models the structure function of a nucleus @xmath22",
    "is described as the incoherent sum over contributions of all kind of clusters @xmath141 with structure functions @xmath142 convoluted with the probability @xmath143 to find a certain cluster @xmath141 of momentum @xmath8 in the nucleus :    @xmath144    examples for such clusters are the nucleon itself , undisturbed or with a reduced mass due to nuclear binding or with an increased size due to different boundary conditions in the nuclear environment , extra pions being responsible for nuclear binding , @xmath145-isobars , multi - quark clusters like bags of 6 quarks , 9 quarks or 12 quarks ( i.e. , @xmath6 particles ) or the whole nucleus as one big bag with free quark and color flow throughout the whole nuclear volume .",
    "there is a lot of freedom in these approaches , concerning as well the choice of @xmath143 as the parameterization of @xmath146 that both are badly known .",
    "consequently , it is not very surprising that they succeed to reproduce a portion of the data rather well , at least in the medium @xmath1 range .      in the third class of approaches",

    "first proposed in refs .",

    "they are caused by the color forces between quarks and gluons which ensure confinement and are the origin of scaling violations , i.e. , the increase of the structure function with @xmath36 at low values of @xmath1 and the decrease with increasing @xmath36 at large values of @xmath1 .",
    "the qualitative argument is as follows : the strength of the strong force between quarks is not only determined by the transverse resolution @xmath147 at which they are probed , but also by the radial extension @xmath148 of the volume in which they are confined .",
    "therefore , the relevant parameter for the strength of the strong coupling constant @xmath149 is not just @xmath36 but @xmath150 .",
    "( this is similar to the situation in nuclear physics where the form factors for spherical nuclei have the identical oscillating pattern when plotted against @xmath151 ) .",
    "if the confinement size is modified inside the nucleus , either due to a ` swelling ' of nucleons , the formation of multi - quark bags , short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations or free quark and color flow throughout the whole nucleus , then , as a consequence , quark and gluon distributions obtained for nuclei @xmath105 and @xmath152 are related by @xmath153 @xmath154 is a rescaling parameter determined by the two confinement scales @xmath148 and @xmath155 . in the so - called dynamical rescaling models it is given by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a low - momentum cut - off for radiating gluons .",
    "consequently , at the same value of @xmath36 , @xmath158 for small values of @xmath1 and @xmath159 for large values of @xmath1 , if @xmath160 .",
    "* @xmath1 rescaling . * in the @xmath1-rescaling models , first proposed in @xcite and then refined by numerous authors , the depletion of the nuclear structure function at medium @xmath1 is explained by conventional nuclear binding and fermi - motion corrections .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence can be reasonably well reproduced if , for a nucleus , the scaling variable @xmath1 is replaced by a modified one @xmath161 . for a nucleon",
    "@xmath162 moving with momentum @xmath163 in a nucleus the variable @xmath7 has to be replaced by @xmath164,\\ ] ] where @xmath165 is the removal energy of the nucleon ( @xmath166 mev ) and @xmath167 is the momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "consequently , at the same kinematics of the scattered lepton , the effective @xmath168 at which the structure function is probed in a nucleus , is larger than @xmath1 for a free nucleon . at large @xmath1",
    "the structure function @xmath11 is steeply falling with @xmath1 and a depletion of the structure function ratios is naturally explained .",
    "recently their has been renewed interest in the emc effect and its possible origin by jlab measurements of the cross section ratios in inclusive electron scattering @xmath169 in the kinematic region @xmath57 where the cross section vanishes for scattering from free nucleons .     measured by slac - e139 at @xmath170 ( left panel ) and by jlab - e02019 in the region @xmath171 ( right panel ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the correlation between the slope @xmath172 in the region @xmath173 and the height of the plateau of @xmath174 in the region @xmath175 ( after @xcite ) . ]",
    "the clas experiment  @xcite has measured @xmath176 for @xmath48he , @xmath67c and @xmath71fe and jlab - e02019  @xcite measured @xmath47 for @xmath80he , @xmath48he , be , c , cu and au . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ab : src ] the cross section ratios @xmath48he / d , c / d and cu / d are shown as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "they rise with @xmath1 until they reach a plateau at @xmath177 .",
    "the height of this plateau increases with @xmath104 .",
    "such a behavior has already been observed with less accuracy by an experiment at slac  @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is seen in the clas comparison of the nuclear cross sections to @xmath80he . here",
    "the measurements extend up to @xmath178 and an indication of a second plateau is observed for @xmath179 .",
    "such a behavior is being interpreted as the manifestation of short - range nucleon - nucleon ( mostly p ",
    "n ) correlations ( three - nucleon correlations for @xmath1 beyond 2 ) or , in another approach , as the ratio of the probabilities to find 6-quark or 9-quark clusters in nuclei compared to the reference nucleus .    fig .",
    "[ ab : src ] shows a very interesting observation @xcite . in the left panel the e139",
    "cross section ratios @xmath48he / d , c / d and fe / d are shown for @xmath170 .",
    "the lines correspond to the slopes @xmath180 in the region @xmath181 , that characterize the strength of the emc effect in this region and are unaffected by overall normalization uncertainties . in the middle panel",
    "the slopes of the e139 data ( tabulated in @xcite and corrected by @xmath182 @xcite ) are plotted against the height of the plateaus  @xcite .",
    "obviously there is a strong correlation between these quantities as indicated by the straight line .",
    "it is rather unlikely that this correlation is purely accidental and one can therefore rather safely assume that a large fraction of the strength of the emc effect in the valence quark region is due to short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations .",
    "the emc effect is with us now for 30 years . it has stimulated huge experimental and theoretical efforts , but its origin is still not fully understood .",
    "recent data shed some new light on its possible origin , i.e. , short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations may play an important role for the observed nuclear modifications . still more precise data are needed , especially on the nuclear gluon and antiquark distributions at very low @xmath1 to constrain the initial state for the @xmath2 program at rhic and lhc .",
    "these hopefully will come from future measurements at jlab12 , rhic and lhc and eventually also from the proposed projects eic and lhec .",
