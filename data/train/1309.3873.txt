    "let us consider the following way of shuffling a deck of @xmath0 cards : at each step , with probability @xmath6 we interchange the position of a pair of adjacent cards chosen uniformly at random ( among the @xmath7 possible choices ) and with probability @xmath6 we do nothing .",
    "how many steps do we need to perform until the deck has been shuffled ?    even though this shuffling method may be of very little practical use for card players ( indeed the usual rifle - shuffles allow a much faster mixing of the deck if executed properly , see @xcite ) , this question has raised a considerable interest in the domain of markov chain for a number of years since aldous in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) proved that @xmath8 steps were sufficient to mix the deck and that @xmath9 steps were necessary .",
    "it appears in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 23 ) in a short list of open problem concerning markov chains mixing times .",
    "a first reason that can be given for this interest is that it is that allowing only local moves ( i.e adjacent transpositions ) adds a constraint which makes the problem more challenging than the usual transposition shuffle ( see @xcite for a computation of the mixing time by algebraic methods , @xcite for a simpler probabilistic proof and @xcite for a recent paper on the subject with additional results on the evolution of the cycle structure of the permutation ) .",
    "a second one is that shuffling with a geometrical constraint is a reasonable toy - model to describe the relaxation of a low density gas .",
    "consider @xmath0 ( labeled ) particles in a box with erratic moves and local interactions , we can ask ourselves the difficult question : how much time is needed for the system to forget all the information about its initial configuration ?",
    "of course the adjacent - transposition is an over - simplification of the problem because it is one dimensional and the only motion that particles ( or cards ) can make is exchanging the position with a neighbor , but a solution to the toy - problem might give an idea of the qualitative behavior of the system . this connection with particle systems becomes more obvious when the simple exclusion process ( which corresponds to the case of unlabeled particles ) is introduced in the next section .    the last substantial progress toward a solution before the writing of this paper was by wilson @xcite , who proved that @xmath10 steps where necessary and that @xmath11 where sufficient , and conjectured that the first was the correct answer . in this paper",
    "we solve this conjecture by showing that the pack is mixed after @xmath12 steps .    for notational convenience",
    "all our results are proved for the continuous time version of the markov chain and the mixing time presented in the theorems differs by a factor @xmath13 .",
    "we show how to prove the result in discrete time is the appendix .",
    "a significant part of the paper is devoted to the study of the mixing of the exclusion process , which is a projection of the adjacent transposition shuffle . the simplest way to describe it is the following : consider a segment with @xmath0 sites , and place @xmath14 particle on this segment , with _ at most _ one particle per site .",
    "we consider the following dynamics : each particle jumps independently with a rate equal to the number of empty site in its neighborhood , the site on which it jumps being chosen uniformly at random between these sites ( equivalently it jumps with rate one on each of the empty neighbors , see figure [ partisep ] , a more formal description is given in the next section ) .",
    "we want to know how long we must wait to come close to the equilibrium state of the particle system , for which all configurations are equally likely .",
    "this model too has a long history and can be considered in a more general setup , with an @xmath15 grid instead of a segment ( or an higher dimensional cube , or a more general graph ) , we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section viii ) for a classical introduction .",
    "the problem of computing the mixing time of the exclusion process has also been well developed both in the case of @xmath16 grid or torus and of general graphs ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us now introduce card shuffles in a mathematical framework .",
    "the adjacent - transposition shuffle ( or at - shuffle ) is a continuous time markov chain on the symmetric group @xmath17 .",
    "we consider that we have a deck of @xmath0 cards that are labeled from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "we number the positions of the cards from top to bottom saying that the top card has position @xmath2 and the bottom one @xmath0 . to an array of cards , we associate a permutation @xmath18 saying that @xmath19 if the @xmath20-th position in the pack is occupied by the card labeled @xmath21 .",
    "our chain selects a card uniformly at random among those in position @xmath2 to @xmath7 and exchanges its position with the one that is immediately below it .",
    "more formally , we let @xmath22 denote the nearest neighbor transpositions @xmath23 ( note that the set @xmath24 is a generator @xmath17 in the group - theoretical sense ) .",
    "the generator @xmath25 of the at - shuffle is defined by its action on the functions of @xmath26 as follows    @xmath27    let @xmath28 denote trajectory of the markov chain with initial condition @xmath29 ( the identity ) and @xmath30 denote the law of distribution of the time marginal @xmath31 . given a probability distribution @xmath32 , we define @xmath33 to be the marginal distribution of @xmath34 , the markov chain starting with initial distribution @xmath32 .    this is a simple example of dynamics where geometry plays a role ( as opposed to mean field models ) : a given card can only interact with its neighbors .",
    "we write @xmath35 for the uniform measure on @xmath17 ( we do not underline the dependence in @xmath0 in the notation when there is no risk of confusion ) . as the transpositions @xmath36 generate",

    "hence , for @xmath0 fixed , when @xmath37 tends to infinity @xmath38 converges to @xmath35 for any initial probability distribution and for this reason we refer to @xmath35 as the equilibrium measure .",
    "we want to study properties of the relaxation to equilibrium of the markov chain or in other words the way in which @xmath30 converges to @xmath35 when @xmath39 , for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate the asymptotic behavior the _ total - variation distance _ to equilibrium which is perhaps the most natural metric for probability measures .    if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two probability measures on a common space @xmath42 , it is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the positive part of @xmath20 .",
