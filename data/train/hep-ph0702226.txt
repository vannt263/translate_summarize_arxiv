    "mesons and baryons have been intensively studied in the framework of potential models for a long time @xcite . moreover , since qcd is a nonabelian gauge theory , the gluons are able to form a bound state , at least in principle .",
    "these bound states of two , three or more gluons are called glueballs .",

    "exotic \" hadrons are hybrid mesons : mesons in which the color field is in an excited state .",
    "they can be seen as a three - body @xmath0 state , with a constituent gluon .",
    "again , hybrid mesons are the subject of many works , in lattice qcd  @xcite , and effective models @xcite .",
    "the experimental detection of exotic hadrons is also an active field of research , although no definitive conclusion has been drawn @xcite .",
    "the confrontation between theoretical approaches and experimental data appears thus particularly interesting in order to confirm or invalidate some exotic candidates .",
    "let us now turn our attention to effective qcd models .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the short - range interaction between two heavy quarks is given by the fermi - breit potential @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the one - gluon exchange process between the quarks , and contains fine structure terms like spin - orbit interaction and tensor force for example .",
    "effective models with a linear confining potential and the fermi - breit potential have been showed to correctly describe the meson and baryon spectrum for a long time @xcite .",
    "apart from phenomenological arguments , the static potential between a quark and an antiquark has also been intensively studied in numerous theoretical works . at large distances , typically for distances larger than @xmath1 gev@xmath2 , the static potential indeed appears to be linearly rising ( see for example the lattice calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at short distances",
    "however , the static potential has been shown to be no longer linear and nonperturbative but rather perturbative and coulombic , just as is the static limit of the fermi - breit interaction  @xcite .",
    "logically , the same kind of models  linear confinement and coulomb term at long- and short - range respectively  has since been applied to describe exotic hadrons , like glueballs @xcite and hybrids @xcite . however ,",
    "if the derivation of the fermi - breit potential between two quarks is a standard procedure , it is not the case for the interactions between two gluons ( see for example the discrepancies between refs .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , the equivalent of the fermi - breit potential between a quark and a gluon has not yet been computed . since recent references , based on lattice qcd computations ,",
    "validate the picture of a glueball as a bound state of constituent gluons  @xcite and of a hybrid meson as a @xmath0 system  @xcite , the accurate knowledge of the gluon - gluon and quark - gluon potentials appears to be crucial point to further understand the properties of these exotic hadrons .",
    "it is thus of interest to compute all these potentials in a systematic way , within a single formalism , in order to obtain a set of potentials which should be applicable to most hadrons , either exotic or not .",

    "it is nowadays accepted that @xmath201 @xcite , with @xmath202  gev . for @xmath203 however , qcd is nonperturbative at low momentum since the strong coupling constant  ( [ asr ] ) blows up .",

    "let us note that strong arguments indicate that this picture is also valid not only for bound states of heavy quarks and antiquarks , but also for bound states of massless gluons  @xcite , thus in the light particle sector .",

    "such a freezing scenario is coherent with the perturbative point of view that we adopted , and justifies in particular the assumption that the lowest order feynman diagrams already give a relevant picture of the short - range interactions between two confined particles .    for completeness ,",
    "it should be pointed out that , although providing a coherent framework to understand to success of potential models and how to build them , the freezing of the strong coupling constant is not universally accepted , see for example the lattice computations of ref .",

    "even the glueball spectrum , computed within a potential model where we used the gluon - gluon potential that we obtained in this work , is in agreement with lattice qcd when massless constituent gluons are used  @xcite . by doing explicit computations , one is thus led to the empirical conclusion that the first relativistic corrections in @xmath219 contain most of the physically relevant information .",

    "<S> we systematically compute the effective short - range potentials arising from second order qcd - diagrams related to bound states of quarks , antiquarks , and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism relies on the assumption that the exchanged gluons are massless , while the constituent gluons as well as the lightest quarks acquire a nonvanishing constituent mass because of confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we recover the well - known fermi - breit interaction in the heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> such an effective potential has been proved in the past to be relevant for the building of accurate potential models describing usual hadrons ( mesons and baryons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general potentials we obtain in this work are also expected to be useful in the understanding of exotic hadrons like glueballs and @xmath0 hybrids . in particular , we compute for the first time an effective short - range quark - gluon potential , and show the existence of a quadrupolar interaction term in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the influence of a possible nonzero mass for the exchanged gluons . </S>"
