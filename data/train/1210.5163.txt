    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , see @xcite ; @xcite for recent reviews ) are most commonly found in star forming galaxies , with the link between the two phenomena spectacularly evident in the most actively star forming systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , not all ulxs are linked to star formation regions .",
    "surveys of ulxs have long identified a minority of them with the old stellar populations of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , although a relatively large proportion of these ulxs may be mis - identifications of background objects , particularly when they have observed x - ray luminosities above @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the recent discoveries of new ulxs in both m31 and m83 that have no young stellar counterpart indicates these objects must be low - mass x - ray binaries associated with an older stellar population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in recent years , a combination of the high x - ray spatial resolution and sensitivity of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ has begun to identify a population of ulxs in elliptical galaxies that have globular clusters ( gcs ) as optical counterparts .",
    "these are particularly interesting given the surmise that gcs are a plausible host for an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "five good candidate gc - ulxs are now known : two in ngc 4472 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , two in ngc 1399 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and a new object in ngc 3379 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , optical spectroscopy of two of these objects shows remarkable emission line nebulae with strong [ o iii ] lines and a lack of h lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the origin of these nebulae remains a subject of much debate ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we report the discovery and characteristics of a new , variable ulx associated with a gc in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 .",
    "although this object has been catalogued by various authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , this was from an april 2000 observation where it had a relatively low luminosity ( @xmath3 , depending on assumed spectrum ) .",
    "we report that in a sequence of observations taken in 2007 and 2011 it had brightened to the ultraluminous regime , and showed significant spectral and temporal variability . in this paper",
    "we present the intriguing behaviour of this object , and discuss its nature .",
    "we assume a distance of @xmath4 mpc to ngc 4649 in this work @xcite .",
    "ngc 4649 has been observed six times by the",
    "_ chandra _ acis - s detector , for a combined exposure of @xmath5 ks .",
    "the details of these observations are summarised in table  [ obsdets ] .",
    "the data were extracted from the _ chandra _ data archive , and then cleaned , combined and searched for point - like sources using the standard ciao tools ; the details of this analysis will be reported in @xcite . here",
    "we focus our attention on the brightest individual source detection , cxou j124346.9 + 113234 , that was detected with an average luminosity in excess of @xmath6 , placing it firmly in the ultraluminous regime . as table",
    "[ obsdets ] shows , a total of @xmath7 counts were accumulated from the object , with in excess of 400 counts detected in each of the three longest observations .",

    "( 2 ) absorption column fitted as part of a simple tbabs*po model , compared to the galactic foreground column of @xmath8 . ( 3 ) does a tbabs*diskbb model constitute an acceptable fit to the data ? here , we use a null hypothesis of @xmath9 ( for the @xmath10 statistic ) or goodness of @xmath11 ( c - stat ) as the criteria for an unacceptable fit , hence for the four datasets close to this cut - off we provide alternative diagnoses of the state .",
    "( 4 ) absorption column for the tbabs*diskbb model .",
    "( 5 ) state diagnosis .",
    "[ brassdiag ]    interestingly , its behaviour appeared to split into two groups .",
    "the first ( obsids 785 , 8182 & 12976 ) could all be interpreted as a cool mcd spectrum ( @xmath12 kev ) plus a non - thermal component , although given the uncertainties on the fits a power - law dominated hard state or a steep power - law with either a cool or hot ( @xmath13 kev ) disc , were also possible interpretations .",
    "crucially , in the absence of very high quality data , a cool disc plus non - thermal tail spectrum is consistent with the ultraluminous state spectrum as described by @xcite , indicative of super - eddington emission from stellar - mass bhbs .",
    "the second group ( 8507 , 12975 & 14328 ) were all best described by an absorbed spectrum , in which the underlying model can not be determined , although the same cool disc plus non - thermal tail model was a possible alternative interpretation for observation 8507 .",
    "interestingly , these three observations were the same three observations in which the gl test detected variability .",
    "this classification is supported by the spectral fits in table  [ specdets ] ",
    "12975 is the only observation in which absorption is clearly detected , and ( unlike the other three datasets ) the best - fitting column was well above galactic ( @xmath14 ) for 8507 and 14328 , although their poor data quality mitigated against excluding null columns .    to put our object in context",
    ", it is instructive to consider the other members of this class .",
    "the primary importance of these objects was as the first positive evidence for black holes in gcs , when previously there was considerable uncertainty that gcs could host such objects @xcite . given the evidence for short- and long - term variability in our object , and the high luminosities it attains , cxou j124346.9 + 113234 is therefore another good candidate black hole in a gc .",
    "the evidence so far points to gc - ulxs being stellar - mass black holes accreting at super - eddington rates .",
    "this is indicated firstly by the possible presence of massive outflows from these objects ( where massive , radiatively - driven outflows are a key prediction of super - eddington accretion , see e.g. @xcite ) , seen in optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite spectroscopy .",
    "secondly , the intrinsic x - ray spectra of the objects themselves betray signs of super - eddington accretion .",
    "for example , the spectra of both the object in rz 2109 , and cxokmzj033831.7@xmath15353058 in ngc 1399 , are cool - disc - dominated when in the ultraluminous regime ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , consistent with an ultraluminous state spectrum where the soft component ( either the outer disc , or perhaps more plausibly the photosphere at the base of a radiatively - driven outflow ) dominates , cf .",
    "@xcite for examples .",
    "furthermore , the ngc 1399 object fades in flux with time and possesses a classic thermal - dominant spectrum at sub - eddington fluxes , consistent with a stellar - mass black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "the second gc - ulx in ngc 4472 possesses a hot disc - like spectrum when ultraluminous @xcite ; but this is also consistent with many ulxs as they reach super - eddington fluxes , e.g. @xcite .",
    "perhaps most pertinently the gc - ulx in ngc 3379 has an underlying hard , power - law continuum spectrum @xcite , similar to our object ; and the variability seen in the rz 2109 object on both short and long timescales can be attributed to variations in the absorption column close to the object @xcite .",
    "so , although we can not definitively rule out the presence of an imbh in cxou j124346.9 + 113234 , a more likely scenario ( based on the @xcite diagnoses ) is that we are observing a stellar - mass object in the ultraluminous state .",
    "we therefore speculate that the ulx , when first observed , was in a steep power - law state with a significant disc contribution ; it then brightened significantly and in the 2007 and 2011 observations it was in an ultraluminous state . in the latter observations",
    "there were indications of increased absorption column when the flux diminished , consistent with the behaviour seen in the rz 2109 gc - ulx .",
    "the most important new evidence from our object is the possible link between enhanced variability and absorption , primarily in obsid 12975 but also very tentatively in both 8507 and 14328 .",
    "this is plausible evidence for an outflow driven by super - eddington processes , if the increase in variability is the result of a clumpy radiatively - driven wind passing across the line - of - sight to the x - ray emitting regions of the ulx , and so simultaneously both providing additional absorption and an extrinsic source of variability ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the luminous ulx ngc 5408 x-1 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that our object has properties consistent with a stellar - mass black hole accreting in the super - eddington ultraluminous state .",
    "interestingly , if it is showing distinctly super - eddington behaviour at only @xmath16 then this argues that the compact object is relatively small , likely @xmath17 .",
    "this is consistent with bh formation in a metal - enriched environment ( see below ) , where the remnants are not expected to be very massive ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , given the peak luminosity of @xmath18 , a highly super - eddington neutron star can not be entirely excluded as a plausible explanation for this ulx . to this end",
    "we note that the z sources often appear at super - eddington luminosities , with circinus x-1 in particular having been seen to reach up to 10 times its eddington limit , and to show a soft , disc - dominated spectrum similar to high accretion rate black holes at such fluxes @xcite . a pertinent scenario for a neutron star hosted in a gc",
    "was suggested by @xcite , who notes that the brightest x - ray sources in gcs could be mildly - beamed super - eddington neutron stars in ultra - compact x - ray binaries ; however difficulties with this scenario were discussed by @xcite .",
    "clearly the current data is unable to unambiguously distinguish whether a black hole or neutron star underlies cxou j124346.9 + 113234 ; unfortunately such a definitive resolution ( e.g. through the detection of type - i bursts ) appears unlikely for any gc - ulx with the current generation of instrumentation .",
    "finally , @xcite note that the host clusters for the previously discovered gc black hole candidates are typically redder ( and hence more metal rich ; although see @xcite ) and more luminous ( and hence more massive ) than an average gc in their host galaxies .",
    "the gc host to cxou j124346.9 + 113234 fits into this pattern ; its @xmath19 colour and @xmath20 magnitude are in the top @xmath21 reddest / brightest gcs in ngc 4649 , and its mass is estimated at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in addition , its relatively small half - light radius is also consistent with the notion that x - ray binaries are more readily formed in clusters with higher collision rates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this fairly typical habitat for an x - ray binary argues against any excessively exotic interpretation for the object ; once again a super - eddington x - ray binary would appear a plausible interpretation .",
    "we have reported the detection of a new ulx coincident with a gc in the galaxy ngc 4649 . as with other members of the still - rare class of gc - ulxs ,",
    "this object is a good candidate to be a black hole radiating at super - eddington luminosities , although we can not entirely exclude the possibility that this is a highly super - eddington neutron star .",
    "the benefit of having had a series of _ chandra _ observations spaced over 11 years is that it has allowed us to demonstrate that this source varies its characteristics with time ; the @xcite simulations show that the observed spectra can be interpreted as super - eddington emission , with some observations showing an additional absorption column .",
    "the observations with additional column also show at least some evidence for short - timescale variability ; together this could be interpreted as evidence for a clumpy , radiatively driven wind ( a key prediction of super - eddington accretion ) crossing the line - of - sight , consistent with some other ulxs .",
    "interestingly , this again points to a commonality in physical processes between ulxs in both old and young stellar populations ( cf .",
    "cxou j124346.9 + 113234 therefore serves to highlight the potentially interesting astrophysics that we can recover from the less well - studied ulxs associated with older stellar populations , both tentatively with current missions and , potentially , in far more detail with future high collecting area and high spatial resolution x - ray observatories .",
