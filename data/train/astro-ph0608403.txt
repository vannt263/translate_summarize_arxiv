    "standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology is characterized by the following features : homogeneity and isotropy when averaged on @xmath3 mpc length scales , negligible spatial curvature , and a stress tensor which today has a chemical composition of approximately 70% dark energy and 30% pressureless dust .",
    "the standard inflationary embedding of frw cosmology currently provides a successful picture of the universe .",
    "however , since the invocation of dark energy leads to a new coincidence problem , which is that dark energy dominance roughly coincides with the epoch of nonlinear structure formation , and since we still do not understand the cosmological constant problem , there has been a renewed interest in exploring alternative inhomogeneous cosmological models ( which are not perturbatively related to frw cosmologies ) to see whether they might offer a competitively plausible picture of the universe @xcite .",
    "supernova luminosity distance measurements as a function of redshift offer compelling evidence for dark energy when interpreted in the context of frw cosmologies @xcite . to interpret such data in the context of inhomogeneous cosmologies",
    ", it is often not particularly useful to average the underlying inhomogeneous variables to obtain a forced interpretation in terms of frw cosmology .",
    "this is because generically there is no preferred spatial slicing to compute averages and no meaningful map between the physical observables and the time derivatives of the spatially averaged variables . in some sense ,",
    "the observables contain more information than that which could be carried by averaged variables , and hence determining the appropriate smearing map on the observables which matches the information that could be carried by averaged variables requires a knowledge of the underlying inhomogeneities in the absence of special symmetries .",
    "therefore , to characterize inhomogeneous cosmologies , it is useful to compute observables such as the luminosity distance function directly in terms of variables describing the underlying inhomogeneous geometry .",
    "the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution corresponds to a spherically symmetric exact solution to the einstein equations with pressureless ideal fluid .",
    "extensive analyses have been carried out for this model because it allows for investigations of inhomogeneities that can not be represented as perturbative deviations from frw cosmologies .",
    "the ltb solution is fixed by choosing three smooth functions @xmath4 , which allow an infinite number of different radial inhomogeneities .",
    "most of the previous attempts to compute a cosmologically plausible luminosity distance @xmath0 as a function of redshift @xmath5 consisted of finding a map from @xmath4 to @xmath0 or a taylor expansion of @xmath6 about @xmath7 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive a map from @xmath8 to @xmath1 .",
    "this has the advantage that the observed luminosity distance function @xmath0 more directly dictates the underlying cosmological model , as opposed to having to guess the right @xmath4 to produce the desired @xmath0 . in @xcite , a similar inverse problem ( with a different choice of variables )",
    "was considered which focused on the situation with @xmath9 , while in this paper , we will keep @xmath10 general . in using this new map , we find the interesting fact that the luminosity distance function is typically ( depending on the choice of @xmath2 ) an effective probe of the ltb geometry only for @xmath11 , since the luminosity distance function has a universal behavior in the limit that @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0 is fixed independently of @xmath1 for @xmath13 , since that limit corresponds to the @xmath14 frw universe .",
    "a negative consequence of this feature is that the differential equation map from @xmath8 to @xmath1 fails to be a numerically accurate map beyond @xmath15 .",
    "nonetheless , we show how the numerical solution can be patched to a semi - analytic solution beyond @xmath16 to obtain a good fit ( to within around @xmath17 for the redshifts of interest ) to obtain an ltb cosmology which reproduces the luminosity distance function of an frw cosmology with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , we make a subsidiary observation about the class of ltb solutions which can mimic the observed @xmath0 .",
    "we find that if the radial inhomogeneity profile goes from @xmath20 to @xmath21 as @xmath22 increases while @xmath23 is positive in that region , there is generically a danger of forming naked singularities , which can be interpreted as due to shell crossing .",

    "note also that the energy density for @xmath231 is larger than @xmath232 , since one side is overdense while the other side is underdense . ]",
    "when @xmath189 reaches zero at nonzero @xmath233 without @xmath23 vanishing , we have a ricci curvature singularity there .",
    "we have also checked the divergence of the energy density near the spacetime region of the naked singularity for several numerical examples , one of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : divergenceofenergy ] . since no metric element became zero",
    "before the singularity comes into existence , we see that the curvature singularity is not protected by a horizon ; _",

    "hence , if @xmath2 changes sign at @xmath191 with @xmath234 and @xmath197 in the vicinity of @xmath188 , a naked singularity develops , and the einstein equations break down in that region . furthermore ,",
    "if we naively continue using the einstein equations past the development of naked singularities , one finds a negative energy density region which is unphysical as expected .    here we note that the model of @xcite does not have any naked singularity problems associated with shell crossing . to see this , we will use the analytic approximation of eq .",

    "the density near @xmath42 is not a monotonic function of time because the initial conditions are set up such that the fluid is flowing towards @xmath42 .",
    "in this paper , we have derived a set of differential equations in the context of ltb cosmologies ( spherically symmetric pressureless dust solutions to the einstein equations ) which can be numerically solved to obtain almost any luminosity - distance - redshift relationship that can be produced by a homogeneous and isotropic frw model .",
    "we have solved this set of differential equations for several examples to demonstrate the feasibility of our inversion method . unlike many other methods in the literature",
    ", our method can be used to dial in the geometry that generates the desired luminosity distance _ exactly _ in a finite redshift interval .",
    "we have also given explicit examples of naked singularity formation in ltb cosmologies in the region where @xmath2 changes sign .",
    "although our work serves as a step towards building cosmological models competitive to the standard frw cosmology , the research program is far from completion .",
    "toy models such as the ltb cosmologies are arguably not yet convincing contenders for compelling alternatives to standard inflationary cosmology , since being at the center of the universe requires giving up the copernican principle ( though recently there has been some effort to alleviate this problem @xcite ) and there is not yet a convincing structure formation history that could explain such radial inhomogeneities . nonetheless , it is not obvious whether this class of ltb models can be ruled out from current observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is some evidence that our galaxy is in a void , qualitatively similar to the voids presented in two of our numerical examples .",
    "however , the existence of the void is still currently being investigated ( see for example @xcite ) , and whether the magnitude of the void is sufficient to cause the redshift effects presented in this paper is unclear",
    ". regarding tests of ltb cosmologies , any physical probe testing the isotropy of the universe from a point separated sufficiently far away from us could in principle be useful .",
