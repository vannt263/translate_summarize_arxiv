    "fomalhaut is one of the sun s closest stellar neighbours and has been the target of numerous studies at multiple wavelengths ( see table [ flux_list ] for a select list of observations ) .",
    "located at a distance of @xmath5 pc @xcite , this @xmath6 myr old a3v star @xcite has a bright , eccentric debris ring at stellar separation of about 140 au , which can serve as an important testbed for debris disc evolution models and potentially planet - disc interactions .",
    "despite extensive study , outstanding issues remain in characterizing fomalhaut s debris system at millimetre ( mm ) wavelengths .",
    "two of such issues are ( 1 ) determining whether there is a debris component that is interior to the 140 au main ring , and ( 2 ) constraining millimetre flux densities of the outer ring , thus determining the millimetre spectral index . both of these are directly related to understanding the evolution of the debris system itself , as well as using the debris to constrain the structure of fomalhaut s putative planetary system .    the possible presence of a warm",
    ", inner debris disc was first identified by @xcite after unresolved excess , compared with the expected stellar emission , was found at 24 @xmath0 m using _ spitzer _ data . to better improve the flux uncertainty ,",

    "@xcite report an excess of @xmath9 over the stellar photosphere in the k band , although they are unable to distinguish between a point source and an extended source for the central emission .",
    "@xcite fit a 3 component model consisting of a point source , an inner disc , and an outer disc to _ herschel _ data and find an unresolved excess of @xmath10 jy , or about 50% over the expected stellar flux .",
    "in contrast , alma @xmath11 m observations @xcite find a total flux about 35% _ lower _ than what is expected from the stellar photosphere and detect no extended structures within 0.2 arcsec ( @xmath12 au ) of the central emission .    for the main ring",
    ", the grain size distribution , @xmath13 , can be used as a tracer of the collisional processes that are present in the late stages of planet formation @xcite .",
    "the size distribution can be further influenced by gravitational interactions with a nearby massive planet or by self - stirring within the disc @xcite .",
    "smaller @xmath0 m sized grains are subject to strong interactions with radiation pressure , while the larger mm grains will be better tracers of the parent body distribution .",
    "the distribution of mm grains in fomalhaut s outer disc can therefore be used to test the collisional models of planetesimals and the dynamical state of the system @xcite .",
    "previous constraints find @xmath13 to be between 3.4 and 4 @xcite ; a more precise measurement is needed to describe the dynamical state of the fomalhaut debris disc .",
    "finally , we note that there is a well - known scattered light feature located nw of the star , just inside the outer debris ring @xcite .",
    "while the nature of the source is debated , it could be directly related to the putative planet fomalhaut b , or it could also be a byproduct of collisional processes @xcite .",
    "observations at infrared wavelengths have failed to detect a planet @xcite in the system .",
    "regardless , the significant eccentricity of the debris ring would be consistent with perturbations from planets @xcite , although hydrodynamic processes could also play a role if there is sufficient gas @xcite .",
    "if the feature and/or the ring s eccentricity are related to a planetary system , then fomalhaut would be an ideal system for studying planet disc - interactions .",
    "in this paper we present 1.3 mm alma data that provide the highest resolution ( 0.28 arcsec ) observations to date of the outer mm - debris disc and allow us to resolve the regions immediately around the star to within about 2 au .",

    "the choice of a gaussian radial profile for the debris s spatial distribution is motivated in part by the system s similarities to the solar system s kuiper belt @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we fit the following parameters : debris disc centre , disc radial width , system inclination relative to the observer , disc position angle , x - offset and y - offset , disc flux , and central emission flux .",
    "the x and y - offsets are the projected angular distances ( measured in arcsec ) of the central emission relative to the geometric centre of the ring .",

    "particles are randomly distributed within the debris ring , according to the given profile .",
    "the local grain temperature is derived assuming thermal equilibrium with the star and is azimuthally symmetric around the center of the disk .",
    "we assume that all the grains in the disc are perfect radiators in radiative equilibrium with the star .",
    "the model is then rotated to a trial sky position and projected onto a grid to get the unscaled brightness distribution .",
