    "the reasons why radio galaxies project high energy jets of relativistic plasma over vast , galactic and even extragalactic , distances from a tiny volume at the nucleus of the host galaxy remain unknown .",
    "essentially _ all _ radio galaxies seem to display jets when observed with sufficient sensitivity and resolution , suggesting this is a fundamental characteristic of radio galaxies and energy transport . a small fraction of these jets are seen in the optical .",
    "this represents a potentially profound insight into the nature of jets since the presence of optical synchrotron radiation demands relativistic particles of high energy and short lifetime , unlike the radio , and in - situ acceleration processes are probably required .",
    "it is widely believed that a rotating black hole at the nucleus , coupled to an inner accretion disk is somehow responsible for the onset of a jet .",
    "the extraordinary collimation is likely to occur at the very nucleus , though galactic influences at larger distances may play a role in collimating the jet , @xcite .",
    "it is also generally accepted that both orientation ( the angle of the emerging jet and of the inner accretion disk to the line of sight ) and relativistic beaming , play roles in the appearance of any particular source to the observer . by such means , fr - i ( or low power ) radio galaxies may , when viewed from the appropriate direction , appear as luminous , variable bl lac objects , @xcite .    optical emission from jets , in the beaming scenario in which the jet moves relativistically towards the observer , is favoured because both the typical synchrotron spectral break is blueshifted closer to the optical window , and also because the intrinsic intensity `` beam pattern '' is strongly forward projected , with an opening angle of order @xmath6 where @xmath2 is the relativistic factor , @xmath7 .",
    "other physical processes may play a role , however .",
    "the high - pressure environment close to a galaxy nucleus could quench the progression of the jet and the high pressure may translate to high synchrotron losses and a greater tendency for optical radiation .",
    "the case of 3c  264 offers evidence of such an influence , as there the optical jet terminates at the very edge of an inner dust lane , @xcite .",
    "age , or rather youth , may also play an important role .",
    "@xcite show the evolution of optical morphology of radio galaxies with increasing radio source size , for example , and discuss this in the context of jet - induced star formation and the alignment effect .    here",
    ", we make a very simple observation that we believe strongly supports the beaming and orientation paradigm , which is that the majority of nearby radio galaxies showing optical jets have compact well - ordered dust disks _ that are almost circular _ and are hence likely to be face - on .",
    "this implies that jets emerge close to perpendicular to such disks and that they are pointing almost towards us .",
    "we also note that the nuclear point source luminosities are consistent with this general behaviour . in   2 we describe the data , in   3 we discuss and conclude .",
    "in a series of proposals , we acquired multiwavelength images of 3cr radio galaxies and quasars using the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on - board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the observations utilised the efficient snapshot mode of observing , whereby short exposures are used to fill scheduling gaps .",
    "the data and observations are described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an early goal of our observations was to use the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of hst to locate new optical synchrotron jets in radio galaxies and hence understand the systematics relating high energy synchrotron emission with the host properties . that effort has been successful , and is ongoing .",
    "new optical jets were found in 3c  78 , @xcite , 3c  15 , @xcite and elsewhere , @xcite . to date , there are about 12 extragalactic radio sources with known optical jets , and a similar number of candidate optical jets .",
    "the majority of nearby confirmed optical jets are in fr - i galaxies and for the purposes of this paper we define a sample of nearby fr - i galaxies by restricting attention to 3cr radio galaxies from @xcite whose redshift @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xcite .",
    "galaxies classified as either fr - i or fr - i / ii in @xcite were selected , resulting in a sample of 25 radio sources , counting 3c  75 as two , as listed in table  1 .",
    "five have known optical jets : 3c  15 , 3c  66b , 3c  78 , 3c  264 , and 3c  274 ( m87 ) .",
    "nuclear point sources are common in our high resolution images of radio galaxies , and may provide additional insight into the beaming hypothesis .",
    "we also therefore measured the nuclear core brightness where there was an obvious point source using aperture photometry and the magnitude zeropoint from the hst data handbook .",
    "the magnitudes are on the vega system and are presented in table  1 .",
    "@xcite investigated the systematics of dust lanes in 3cr galaxies from the snapshot observations and show that in fr - i galaxies , dust lanes tend to be regular and compact and that in such sources there is a strong tendency for the radio axis to be perpendicular to the dust disk .",
    "typical scale lengths for the dust disks are hundreds of parsecs .",
    "@xcite present an in - depth analysis of the dust - lanes in several of these nearby radio galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed study of 3c  264 and showed its remarkable circular dust disk , with the bright optical jet apparently terminating at the edge of the disk , fig .  2 .",
    "the morphology of this dust lane was quite unique , with no other dust lanes of the @xcite sample having such a circular appearance .",
    "however , detection of round , low optical depth dust features can be difficult since they can be significantly harder to see than edge - on features that cut into the galaxy isophotes .",
    "motivated by the appearance of the 3c  264 disk , and a similar one in 3c  66b , @xcite , we inspected all the remaining low@xmath10 fr - i optical jet galaxies to search for the presence of subtle dust features , and in addition those of the well - defined sample of 25 ( above ) which had not already been investigated .",
    "this was done in case , by looking harder at the jet galaxies than the others , we were biassing our result .",
    "_ however , of the 25 galaxies , 24 have clearly detectable dust .",
    "_ even the remaining one , the southern component of 3c  75 , shows a hint of a very faint feature in an archival hst image .",
    "the dust detection rate is 96%  and we conclude therefore that we are not witnessing the effects of missing subtle dust features in galaxies : our dust detection rate is essentially complete . fig .",
    "1 shows dust images of those galaxies not shown in the references above .",
    "2 shows the dust in the optical jet galaxies shown in a variety of ways .",
    "all five of the optical jet objects have multicolor hst images available . for 3c  264 and 3c",
    "66b no special processing is needed , and we simply show a single direct image for each . for the others , we fitted isophotes to the red f702w galaxy images with iterative sigma clipping to reject isophotal outliers ( i.e. the jets ) .",
    "the isophotal profiles were then used to make a smooth , perfectly elliptical model of the red light in the galaxy ( where the effects of dust are minimized ) , and the bluer data is divided by this red model as in @xcite to generate an image of the dust .",
    "these are the @xmath11 images , or `` dust images '' referred to elsewhere in the text .    the center row of fig .",
    "2 shows the galaxy hosting 3c  15 . to",
    "the left is a direct image , whose irregularities are attributable to dust . in the center",
    "is a pure @xmath12 image , and on the right is the @xmath11 image .",
    "the large scale circular features in the @xmath11 image are most likely artifacts from the modelling , unlike the more compact feature towards the center which also shows in the @xmath12 data image ( i.e. the ratio of the @xmath13 image to the @xmath14 image , as opposed to the ratio of the @xmath13 image to a smooth , elliptical model of the @xmath14 image ) .",
    "the dust optical depth is low ( as might be expected if the dust lane is close to face - on ) , but by comparing the different images , and perhaps most easily seen in the center one , there is a faint , almost complete , ring of absorption and reddening , rather deeper to the west .",
    "the jet is on a much larger scale than the dust , as it is in 3c  66b .    the lowest row of fig .",
    "2 shows the dust in 3c  78 . to",
    "the left is a direct @xmath13 image , in the center is a direct @xmath14 image and on the right , the @xmath13 image divided by a smooth model of the @xmath14 image .",
    "again , by comparing amongst the images , the absorption can be seen in the color image and in the direct @xmath13 .",
    "it is almost absent in the @xmath14 image .",
    "once more , absorption can be traced entirely around the nucleus in a compact ring .    hence , remarkably , four of the five optical jet galaxies show circular dust lanes .",
    "the other one is m87 whose dust shows a more chaotic morphology , with distinct , roughly radial filaments that coincide with line - emitting gas , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "_ none _ of the other 25 galaxies show similar circular dust lanes .    to obtain a better estimate of the axial ratios of each of the `` round '' dust lanes ,",
    "four cuts were made at @xmath15 angles to one another across the clearest images .",
    "the diameters were marked by eye , and these measurements were then used to determine the parameters of the least - squares best - fit ellipse .",
    "the resulting measurements are given in table  1 .",
    "note that uncertainties tend to bias the measurements to smaller @xmath16 values if the disk is truly circular . the remaining dust lane axial ratios were taken either from the literature as cited , or measured from the direct images referenced using a major and minor axis cut .    fig .",
    "3 shows the axial ratio distributions of the dust lanes in radio galaxies for the 15 galaxies with reasonably well - defined dust disks , and it is clear that the optical - jet objects have a significantly rounder distribution . formally , the difference is significant at the 0.1%  level ( i.e. a probability of chance occurrence of less than 0.001 ) , based on the plotted axial ratio distributions and using the fisher exact probability test .",
    "the diameters of the dust disks ( or rings ) are approximately 1300 , 350 , 430 and 620  pc for 3c  15 , 66b , 78 and 264 respectively , assuming @xmath17  km / s / mpc .",
    "the simplest way to understand this result is that a round dust disk is a dust disk seen close to face - on .",
    "since we have shown in @xcite , that radio jets tend to lie perpendicular to dust disks , especially in the settled fr - i objects , the natural inference therefore is that we are also seeing the optical jets almost pole on , that is pointing directly towards us .",
    "@xcite found that for fr - i sources with dust disks of size @xmath18  kpc , the radio jet lies within less than or about 15  degrees of the disk ( perpendicular ) axis ( but with a small number of exceptions such as 3c31 ) .",
    "the roundest disk in the sample without jets would imply an inclination @xmath19 of order 40  degrees to the line - of - sight if it is intrinsically circular .",
    "similarly , the flattest disk in the jet sample would require an angle @xmath19 to the line of sight of @xmath20  degrees , taken at face value .",
    "this suggests that the dispersion in angles @xmath19 is dominated by the projection of the assembly of dust disk plus jet , rather than by an intrinsic scatter of jet angles to dust disk angles .",
    "it also implies that there is a critical angle , @xmath21 , such that if jets point within that angle we see optical emission . from these numbers we expect @xmath21 to lie in the range 3040  degrees .",
    "there are some small asymmetries and irregularities apparent in the circular dust lanes , and these may be due to the effects of what inclination there is to the plane of the sky , or else to intrinsic irregularities within the disk .",
    "detailed analysis of the optical depth around the disk becomes highly model dependent as there is nowhere to obtain the unobscured light profile .",
    "_ why _ jets and dust lanes are close to perpendicular remains a mystery .",
    "since these are relaxed , orderly systems , perhaps the disk , galaxy and black hole spin axes have had time to co - align , @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the jet ejection process itself may react back on the disk and force it into a perpendicular orientation , @xcite .",
    "also , in these round dust disks , the outer edge of the disk is remarkably sharp .",
    "perhaps this is an indication of a more settled and evolved disk than the irregular morphologies often seen , @xcite , which would in turn suggest that evolutionary processes within the jets are not responsible for the optical emission",
    ". one would expect galaxy dynamical timescales to be much longer than the evolutionary timescale for a radio jet ( given its high speed and short synchrotron loss lifetime ) .",
    "if the sample is a set of randomly oriented linear jets , we expect the distribution of @xmath19 to be @xmath22 for @xmath19 in the range 0 to 90  degrees .",
    "hence , statistically we would expect a fraction @xmath23 to have an angle to the line of sight @xmath19 less than a critical angle @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath24  degrees , then the fraction is 23%  which for a sample size of 25 means six objects ( three if @xmath25  degrees ) .",
    "this is obviously consistent with the five that we find , if the optical jet galaxies represent those whose jets point within 3040  degrees to the line of sight .",
    "it is possible that more face - on disks tend to appear more irregular and hence are excluded from the statistical comparison .",
    "there are no compelling reasons to think that this is actually the case , however .",
    "one of the 10 galaxies with `` irregular '' dust has an optical jet ; by chance we would expect 1.8 galaxies to be oriented with @xmath26  degrees so there is nothing inconsistent in the statistics to suggest a large fraction of the irregular dust disks are actually face - on .",
    "hence , we are led to a picture where optical jets `` appear '' when they point to within ( of order ) @xmath27  degrees to our line - of - sight , based on the apparent axial ratios of their associated dust lanes .",
    "this is reasonable qualitatively , given expected relativistic beaming and doppler boosting of the underlying synchrotron break frequency .",
    "@xmath2 values of order ` a few ' are typically thought to occur jets in radio galaxies , and indeed superluminal proper motion is observed in the jet of m87 which is very direct evidence for @xmath2 values of order @xmath28 , @xcite . if the beam angular width is @xmath29 , a critical angle of @xmath30  degrees implies a rather lower value , @xmath31 or @xmath32 . if @xmath25  degrees , the corresponding @xmath33 and @xmath34 . such numbers should be taken as illustrative : clearly , in principle , beams are observable outside the primary beam width , at much lower surface brightness .",
    "much deeper observations with fainter surface brightness limits may help to disentangle the effects of multiple velocity components and intrinsic beam pattern .",
    "@xcite discuss the case for relativistic beaming in fr - i radio galaxies in detail .",
    "based on comparison with radio data , primarily , they develop a consistent model in which jets are intrinsically symmetric , initially relativistic but decelerating , and faster on - axis than at the edges .",
    "this is quite consistent with our inference of jet @xmath35 provided that either optical emission becomes unobservable at lower values of @xmath2 ( where the beam is broad enough for many more jets to be included within it ) or else the jets never have velocity less than @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite finds a best fitting velocity for single - velocity models , of @xmath37 , but they also achieve good fits with lower minimum velocities when a range of velocities is allowed .",
    "it seems more plausible that the optical emission becomes undetectable ( with current observations ) at lower velocity .",
    "nuclear point sources are common in radio galaxies , and are often apparently bright in galaxies with optical jets , @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the optical core source luminosity is very well correlated with the radio core flux , and hence is most likely also synchrotron emission arising from the base of the jet . in a pilot study of five objects",
    "@xcite showed that there are indications of a correlation between gas disk inclination and core prominence , consistent with the expectations of the proposed unification of bl lac and fr - i radio galaxies . to take this a step further",
    ", we plot the nuclear magnitude where there was obviously a point source against the axial ratio of the dust lanes , fig .  4 .",
    "there is a trend , with the brightest cores in the most face - on disks , and a correlation coefficient of @xmath38 yielding a formal significance level of better than 1% .",
    "however , many targets do not appear on the plot .",
    "either they have cores but irregular dust , including two of the brightest , or else they do not have well - defined cores in our data .",
    "we consider the plot therefore primarily indicative and intriguing for future study .    to examine the fr - i / bl lac unification idea ,",
    "we include on fig .",
    "4 the average of the bl  lac objects from the comparison sample of @xcite , showing the @xmath39 dispersion in their magnitudes .",
    "we assume this representative bl  lac object is viewed directly along the line - of - sight .",
    "if the average spectral index is @xmath40 in the optical , the relativistic boosting for continuous outflow is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for illustration ,",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath44 is shown , with the zeropoint of the proportionality chosen so that the curve passes through the bl  lac point and assuming that all nuclei have the same intrinsic brightness .",
    "the derived @xmath2 is sensitive to @xmath45 , with lower @xmath45 yielding higher @xmath2 .",
    "while there are major uncertainties and selection effects ( we only see the most luminous cores ; there is no expectation that all cores have identical intrinsic flux ) it is interesting to note that there is a good consistency with conventional beaming models and relativistic factors between 1 and 10",
    ". a more detailed investigation into these issues would be useful .",
    "perhaps the most worrisome objection to the scenario described in   4.1",
    "is that in the case of 3c  264 , the optical jet flares and essentially ends _",
    "right at the edge of the dust disk_. this leads one to suppose either ( 1 )  a causal connection , as discussed by @xcite , or ( 2 )  a coincidence .",
    "none of the other optical jets show any sign of interaction with the host disks : for the most part they are on a much larger spatial scale . in the scenario where the disk is face - on and the jet almost perpendicular to it , the coincidence of the jet flaring out at the edge of the disk",
    "must be accepted . in the contrary situation , where the jet ends at the edge of the disk due to a physical interaction with the disk , the alternate coincidence that of all galaxies",
    ", this one has the most face - on disk must be accepted .",
    "more exotic options , such as dust spheres in the centers of optical - jet galaxies rather than disks , can be excluded from detailed analysis of the color distribution in the case of 3c  264 , @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to resolve this issue , either with increased sample sizes for the optical jet cases , although that seems unlikely given our 100%  detection rate for nearby fr - i dust lanes , while more distant objects are much harder to resolve , or else by demonstrating perhaps through spectroscopic observations , that there is a genuine interaction between the 3c  264 dust lane and the outward propagating jet . in the latter case , we would favour a scenario in which more than one physical process can be relevant , however it would remain very curious as to why that one disk , of all disks , is so close to circular !",
    "we have derived a simple but appealing result : those galaxies with optical jets that are sufficiently nearby to allow a detailed view of the nuclear environments and whose nuclei are not so luminous as to swamp that view , show in 4 out of 5 cases evidence for a circular dust disk .",
    "none of the other 21 galaxies in the sample show such a feature .",
    "we interpret this as support for a two - fold model in which jets emerge perpendicular to dust lanes and optical emission arises when those jets are pointing towards us , specifically within a critical angle of @xmath46@xmath47  degrees .",
    "nuclear core luminosities show a trend with more luminous cores in the face - on disks , as expected from the beaming scenario .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through proposal number go-5476.01 - 93a from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
