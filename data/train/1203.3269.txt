    "we consider the two - way wireless relaying scenario shown in fig.[relay_channel ] , where bi - directional data transfer takes place between the nodes a and b with the help of the relay r. it is assumed that all the three nodes operate in half - duplex mode , i.e. , they can not transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band .",
    "the relaying protocol consists of the following two phases : the _ multiple access _ ( ma ) phase , during which a and b simultaneously transmit to r using identical square @xmath0-qam signal sets and the _ broadcast _ ( bc ) phase during which r transmits to a and b using possibly with another square @xmath0-qam or constellations of size more than @xmath0 .",
    "network coding is employed at r in such a way that a ( b ) can decode the message of b ( a ) , given that a ( b ) knows its own message .",
    "the concept of physical layer network coding has attracted a lot of attention in recent times .",
    "the idea of physical layer network coding for the two way relay channel was first introduced in @xcite , where the multiple access interference occurring at the relay was exploited so that the communication between the end nodes can be done using a two stage protocol .",
    "information theoretic studies for the physical layer network coding scenario were reported in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the design principles governing the choice of modulation schemes to be used at the nodes for uncoded transmission were studied in @xcite .",
    "an extension for the case when the nodes use convolutional codes was done in @xcite .",
    "a multi - level coding scheme for the two - way relaying scenario was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that for uncoded transmission , the network coding map used at the relay needs to be changed adaptively according to the channel fade coefficients , in order to minimize the impact of the multiple access interference .",
    "the proposed latin square scheme was studied in @xcite , @xcite by considering a two way relaying using @xmath0-psk signal sets at the end nodes . in @xcite analysis of 16-qam",
    "is done under the assumption that precoding is done at the end nodes .",
    "we address the situation where no precoding assumption is made and to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported for such a scenario with general @xmath0-qam modulation .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the square @xmath0-qam constellation used at a and b , where @xmath7 , @xmath2 being a positive integer .",
    "assume that a ( b ) wants to transmit an @xmath8-bit binary tuple to b ( a ) .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the mapping from complex symbols to bits used at a and b. let @xmath10 , @xmath11 denote the complex symbols transmitted by a and b respectively , where @xmath12 .",
    "the received signal at @xmath13 is given by , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fading coefficients associated with the a - r and b - r links respectively .",
    "the additive noise @xmath17 is assumed to be @xmath18 , where @xmath18 denotes the circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath19 .",
    "we assume a block fading scenario , with the ratio @xmath20 denoted as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is referred as the _ fade state _ and for simplicity , also denoted by @xmath24    let @xmath25 denote the effective constellation at the relay during the ma phase , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the minimum distance between the points in @xmath25 , i.e. ,    @xmath28    from , it is clear that there exists values of @xmath4 for which @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 .",
    "the elements of @xmath31 are said to be _ the singular fade states_. singular fade states can also be defined as    a fade state @xmath4 is said to be a singular fade state , if the cardinality of the signal set @xmath32 is less than @xmath33 .    for example , consider the case when symmetric 4-qam signal set used at the nodes a and b , i.e. , @xmath34 . for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , since , @xmath37 alternatively , when @xmath35 , the constellation @xmath25 has only 12 ( @xmath3816 ) points .",
    "hence @xmath35 is a singular fade state for the case when 4-qam signal set is used at a and b. let @xmath39 denote the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimate of @xmath40 at r based on the received complex number @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42      depending on the value of @xmath4 , r chooses a map @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the signal set ( of size between @xmath0 and @xmath33 ) used by r during @xmath45 phase .",
    "the elements in @xmath46 which are mapped on to the same complex number in @xmath44 by the map @xmath47 are said to form a cluster .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the set of all such clusters .",
    "the formation of clusters is called clustering , and denoted by @xmath49 to indicate that it is a function of @xmath50 the received signals at a and b during the bc phase are respectively given by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the complex number transmitted by r. the fading coefficients corresponding to the r - a and r - b links are denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively and the additive noises @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57 ) .    in order to ensure that a ( b ) is able to decode b s ( a s ) message , the clustering @xmath58 should satisfy the exclusive law @xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath59    the cluster distance between a pair of clusters @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the minimum among all the distances calculated between the points @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 the _ minimum cluster distance _ of the clustering @xmath58 is the minimum among all the cluster distances , i.e. ,    @xmath65    the minimum cluster distance determines the performance during the ma phase of relaying .",
    "the performance during the bc phase is determined by the minimum distance of the signal set @xmath44 . for values of @xmath4 in the neighborhood of the singular fade states ,",
    "the value of @xmath27 is greatly reduced , a phenomenon referred as _",
    "distance shortening_. to avoid distance shortening , for each singular fade state , a clustering needs to be chosen such that the minimum cluster distance at the singular fade state is non - zero and is also maximized .",
    "a clustering @xmath58 is said to remove a singular fade state @xmath66 , if @xmath67 . for a singular fade state @xmath68 ,",
    "let @xmath69 denote a clustering which removes the singular fade state @xmath70 ( if there are multiple clusterings which remove the same singular fade state @xmath70 , consider a clustering which maximizes the minimum cluster distance ) .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the set of all such clusterings .",
    "let @xmath72 be defined as ,    @xmath73    the quantity @xmath74 is referred to as the minimum cluster distance of the clustering @xmath75 evaluated at @xmath76    in practice , the channel fade state need not be a singular fade state .",
    "in such a scenario , among all the clusterings which remove the singular fade states , the one which maximizes the minimum cluster distance is chosen .",
    "in other words , for @xmath77 , the clustering @xmath78 is chosen to be @xmath75 , which satisfies @xmath79 .",
    "since the clusterings which remove the singular fade states are known to all the three nodes and are finite in number , the clustering used for a particular realization of the fade state can be indicated by r to a and b using overhead bits .    in the case of bpsk ,",
    "if channel condition is @xmath80 and @xmath81 the distance between the pairs @xmath82 is zero as in fig.[fig : bpsk](a).the following clustering remove this singular fade state . @xmath83",
    "the minimum cluster distance is non zero in this clustering .        to remove the distance shortening effect a procedure",
    "is given in @xcite when the nodes a and b use qpsk signal set .",
    "the procedure suggested in @xcite to obtain the channel quantization and the clusterings , was using a computer algorithm , which involved varying the fade state values over the entire complex plane , i.e. , @xmath84 , @xmath85 in small discrete steps and finding the clustering for each value of channel realization .",
    "but such an approach have many issues . in @xcite",
    ", it is claimed that the clustering used by the relay is indicated to a and b by using overhead bits .",
    "however , the procedure suggested in @xcite to obtain the set of all clusterings , was using a computer search algorithm ( called closest neighbour clustering ( cnc ) algorithm ) , which involved varying the fade state values over the entire complex plane , i.e. , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and finding the clustering for each value of channel realization as discussed in previous sections .",
    "the total number of network codes which would result is known only after the algorithm is run for all possible realizations @xmath4 which is uncountably infinite and hence the number of overhead bits required is not known beforehand . moreover , performing such an exhaustive search is extremely difficult in practice , especially when the cardinality of the signal set @xmath0 is large .",
    "the implementation complexity of cnc suggested in @xcite is extremely high : it appears that , for each realization of the singular fade state , the cnc algorithm of @xcite needs to be run at r to find the clustering .    in the cnc algorithm suggested in @xcite , the network coding map is obtained by considering the entire distance profile .",
    "the disadvantages of such an approach are two - fold .",
    "* considering the entire distance profile , instead of the minimum cluster distance alone which contributes dominantly to the error probability , results in an extremely large number of network coding maps .",
    "for example , for 16-qam signal set , the cnc algorithm results in more than 18,000 maps @xcite . *",
    "the cnc algorithm tries to optimize the entire distance profile , even after clustering signal points which contribute the minimum distance . as a result , for several channel conditions , the number of clusters in the clustering obtained is greater than the number of clusters in the clustering obtained by taking the minimum distance alone into consideration .",
    "this results in a degradation in performance during the bc phase , since the relay uses a signal set with cardinality equal to the number of clusters . for example , for 16-qam signal set , the relay has to use signal sets of cardinality 16 to 29 @xcite .    in @xcite , to overcome the two problems mentioned above , another algorithm is proposed ,",
    "in which for a given @xmath4 , an exhaustive search is performed among all the network coding maps obtained using the closest - neighbour clustering algorithm and a map with minimum number of clusters is chosen .",
    "the difficulties associated with the implementation of the cnc algorithm carry over to the implementation of this algorithm as well .",
    "the contributions and organization of the paper are as follows :    * a procedure to obtain the number of singular fade states for pam and qam signal sets is presented . *",
    "it is shown that for the same number of signal points @xmath0 , the number of singular fade states for square @xmath0-qam is lesser in comparison with the number of singular fade states for @xmath0-psk .",
    "the advantages of this result are two fold - qam offers better distance performance in ma phase and qam requires lesser number of latin squares ( i.e. , a reduction in number of overhead bits ) . * to remove the singular fade state @xmath86 for @xmath87-pam , a latin square is constructed .",
    "it is shown that the bit - wise xor mapping can not remove the singular fade state @xmath86 for any @xmath0-qam and a different mapping is obtained to remove the singular fade state @xmath86 , from the latin square to remove the singular fade state @xmath86 for @xmath87-pam .",
    "* by simulation it is shown that the choice of 16-qam leads to better performance for both the rayleigh and the rician fading scenario , compared to 16-psk .",
    "the remaining content is organized as follows :    in section [ sec2 ] we discuss the relationship between singular fade states and difference constellation of the signal sets used by the end nodes .",
    "we present expressions to get the number of singular fade states for pam and square qam signal sets in subsections [ subsec_1_2 ] and [ subsec_2_2 ] respectively . in subsection [ subsec_3_2 ]",
    "it is proved that the number of singular fade states for @xmath0-qam is always lesser in comparison with that of @xmath0-psk signal sets . in section [ sec3 ] the clustering for a singular fade state",
    "is obtained through completing a latin square and a latin square for removing the singular fade state @xmath88 is analytically obtained for pam and qam signal sets . in section [ sec4 ] simulation results",
    "are provided to show the advantage of latin square scheme for qam over xor network coding scheme as well as latin square scheme for psk signal sets under rayleigh and rician fading channel assumptions .",
    "in this section we show the relationships between singular fade states and difference constellation of the signal set used by the end nodes .",
    "the following lemma discusses the location of singular fade states in complex plane for any constellation used at end nodes .",

    "the pair @xmath96 and @xmath97 result in the same point in the effective constellation at the relay if the complex numbers @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the same .",
    "the expression is obtained by equating these complex numbers .    from lemma [ sfs ]",
    "it can be seen that all the singular fade states in the complex plane is of the form of ratio of difference constellation points of the signal sets used by end nodes , i.e. , the singular fade states are decided by the difference constellation points .",
    "henceforth , throughout the paper , we assume both the end nodes use same constellation , @xmath6 .",

    "for each of the difference constellation point , the pair in the signal set which correspond to this point is also shown .",
    "we will often consider only the first quadrant of @xmath115 only , denoted as @xmath116 which for a general complex signal set is given by @xmath117 the following lemma gives the number of singular fade states for pam signal sets .",
