    "let us consider deep inelastic scattering of electrons off nuclei as a following two step process ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : electrons interact with valence partons ( quarks ) of nucleons , which in turn interact between themselves as nuclear constituents and this fact means that their properties must be suitable modified by nuclear the environment .",
    "the gluonic and the sea @xmath1 content of nucleons will be accounted for by their higher fock space components @xcite of the nuclear wave function like , for example , pions @xcite .",
    "the nuclear structure function is therefore given by the convolution , @xmath2 of nucleon distribution function , @xmath3 , and structure function ( sf ) of free nucleon , @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 ( the bjrken variable for the nucleus ) is the ratio of quark and nucleus longitudinal momenta , @xmath6 denotes similar ratio of nucleon and nuclear longitudinal momenta and @xmath7 ( the bjrken variable for the nucleon ) is ratio of the quark and nucleon longitudinal momenta ( with @xmath8 being the parton energy , @xmath9 its @xmath10 component and @xmath11 the nucleon mass ) .",
    "we shall demonstrate in the framework of simple statistical model @xcite and by using some specific monte carlo simulation @xcite how sf of free nucleons , @xmath12 , changes in nucleus because of the nuclear fermi motion ( energy momentum conservation is always strictly imposed ) .",
    "let us , however , first start with a short reminder of the situation encountered in the nuclear relativistic mean field ( rmf ) description of nuclear dynamics . in this",
    "approach electrons are scattered on nucleons moving in constant average scalar and vector potentials in the rest frame of the nucleus and are described by dirac equation , @xmath13\\psi = 0 , \\label{eq : dirac}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are scalar and vector meson coupling constants and their masses , respectively , whereas @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the respective scalar and ( fourth component ) vector densities .",
    "the positive and negative solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) are used .",
    "it turns out that to explain the observed enhancement of the spin - orbit part of nucleon - nucleus optical potential one needs relatively big values of @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev . on the other hand",
    "it can be shown @xcite that nucleon distribution function inside the nucleus can be written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is limited to @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the nucleon fermi energy and the nucleon chemical potential @xmath25 mev .",
    "the corresponding results ( dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) show that in such approach the influence of nuclear medium disappears @xcite ( one should also mention at this point that the widely discussed contributions from the additional , i.e. , in the medium , pions were recently disclaimed @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that in our calculations leading to this result the quark primordial distribution ( pd ) of the nucleon in the medium is left unchanged . in what follows",
    "we shall now examine how the nuclear medium can change this pd using two different phenomenological approaches .",
    "we start with statistical model for nucleon structure functions in which partons are considered as a gas of noninteracting particles remaining on energy shell @xcite ( i.e. , with @xmath26 ( because of the confinement the free - parton distribution was divided here by @xmath27 @xcite ) . for nucleons in the nuclear medium",
    "we shall separate out the fermi motion and write the average ( over nucleus ) sum of the energies of all partons as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average kinetic ( fermi ) energy of nucleon and @xmath30 is the nucleon energy in its rest frame . in this way we are introducing a change in the parton energy ( by shifting it to smaller values ( [ eq : fermi ] ) ) , which , in turn , results in the width of energy pd being smaller than in the analogous distribution for the free nucleon ( and , at the same time , being more peaked at the origin ) .",
    "this results in the depletion of @xmath4 in nuclear medium for @xmath31 . however , for @xmath32 the scale @xmath33 shown in fig .",
    "1 becomes comparable with the actual size of nucleon ( or bigger that it , the expected sizes of corresponding nuclear clusters also grow accordingly ) .",
    "therefore in this region the correction ( [ eq : fermi ] ) deduced only from the single nucleon fermi motion in not longer valid @xcite and we have to consider also motion of the whole interacting cluster with size given by @xmath34 , which , in the limit of @xmath35 , becomes a whole nucleus . in another words : for @xmath32 the time of the electron - nucleus interaction is sufficiently large for the parton , which has been hit , to change in the final state ( because of the collective nucleon - nucleon interactions ) both its localization and its four momentum .",
    "the results taking this effect into account are shown in fig .",
    "2 as solid line .",
    "we proceed now to the next phenomenological example in which we are using the simple monte carlo model developed recently @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 denote four - momentum of the struck parton ( probed by current with virtuality @xmath37 ) selected ( for valence quarks ) from gaussian pd with width @xmath38 gev , @xmath39 - the respective four - momentum of hadronic remnants and @xmath40 and @xmath41 their respective invariant masses .",
    "only events satisfying the exact kinematical constraints of the corresponding deep - inelastic reaction probing our nuclear distribution , @xmath42 are accepted and selected to form the final distribution we are looking for . calculating the momentum distribution of partons inside bound nucleons , with our basic assumption that primordial parton distribution in the nuclear medium remains the same but that we include now fermi motion of nucleons , we have to subtract the fermi motion in the nucleon rest frame .",
    "this mechanism works similarly to the decreasing of the size of the valence parton momentum distribution used in @xcite and produces both the minimum for @xmath43 around @xmath44 and the maximum around @xmath45 .",
    "it can be interpreted as increasing de - confinement region in the configuration space . as in the statistical model above ( [ eq : fermi ] ) , the substraction of the fermi average energy changes the energy width of energy parton pd by @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in fig . 2 as full triangles ( which practically follow the solid line representing results of the previous approach showing therefore their equivalence ) .",
    "the sea parton distribution is given here by the convolution of the pionic component of the nucleon , @xmath47 , and the parton structure of pion , @xmath48 , obtained from the same gaussian pd as used for valence partons .",
    "notice that the influence of fermi motion is strong but the agreement for small @xmath43 is lost .",
    "we shall therefore improve the treatment of sea quarks . in the presented model the sea parton distribution",
    "is generated directly from distribution of the pionic cloud which surrounds the nucleon core constituted by the valence quarks . because part of these pions is responsible for mediating nucleon - nucleon interactions ,",
    "the corresponding part of the sea quarks must be connected rather to whole nuclear medium and not to the individual nucleons . for small",
    "@xmath43 the crucial factor turns out to be the change of the nuclear virtual pion cloud connected with the exchanged mesons responsible for the the nuclear forces @xcite . in order to be able",
    "to fit data in this region we have therefore to adjust the value of the parameter which determines the relative number of the ( effective ) intermediate pions ( which are assumed to mediate the nucleon - nucleon interaction ) .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the proportion leading to good results is to assign @xmath49 of virtual pions to contribute to the sea quark structure function of the nucleon and let the rest to be responsible for the the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "full calculation in which the width of the energy - momentum pd was changed by @xmath50 ( from @xmath51 gev to @xmath52 gev ) result in very good fit to experimental data including the small @xmath43 region ( see fig . 2 - full squares ) .",
    "we conclude by stating that fermi motion of nucleons inside the nucleus provides very big contribution to the nucleon pd in the nuclear medium ( at least in the examples considered here ) .",
    "therefore , contrary to some previous calculations and conclusions to the opposite @xcite ( including recent work @xcite ) , it affects strongly the observed emc ratio in the broad range of variable @xmath53 . +",
