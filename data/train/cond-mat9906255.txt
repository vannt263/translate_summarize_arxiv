    "transient spectroscopy of quantum - well ( qw ) structures allows to study the emission processes from the qws and thus to obtain information on qw parameters , such as the energy spectrum , photoionization cross - section , tunneling escape time , etc .",
    "@xcite this technique is based on an analysis of the transient current or capacitance relaxation upon the application of a _ large - signal _ bias across the qw structure .",
    "it complements admittance spectroscopy , which studies the _ ac _ current in the qw structure upon application of a _ small - signal _ voltage .  @xcite the transient spectroscopy of qws has many similarities with the deep level transient spectroscopy ( dlts )  @xcite and enables a simple theory to be derived for use in the processing of experimental data .",
    "@xcite however , there is an important difference in the carrier capture by deep levels and that involving qws . in the latter case ,",
    "the presence of a continuous energy spectrum for the in - plane motion in the qw allows the capture by emission of a single optical phonon rather than by a multi - phonon processes typical for deep levels .",
    "@xcite as a result , the corresponding capture times are several orders of magnitude less than for deep levels and often do not exceed a few picoseconds .",
    "@xcite this quantitative difference results in serious qualitative consequences .",
    "the processes of carrier transport between neighboring qws can no longer be considered as infinitely fast .",
    "these processes may play a decisive role in the relaxation kinetics changing noticeably the formulae of a simple theory , similar to the case of structures with very high concentration of deep levels .",
    "@xcite in this work we present a theoretical description of the transient spectroscopy of qws and discuss its possible applications .",
    "we obtain more general analytical expressions for the parameters of the transient current than those of ref .  .",
    "the analytical model is confirmed by numerical simulation , and the procedure of the extraction of the qw parameters from experimental data is discussed .",
    "we consider a qw structure containing @xmath0 qws ( n - doped at sheet density @xmath1 ) of width @xmath2 separated by undoped barriers of width @xmath3 large enough to prevent inter - well tunneling ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this structure is typical for quantum well infrared photodetectors ( qwips ) .",
    "@xcite the qw structure is provided with a heavily doped ( ohmic ) collector and a blocking emitter contact ( for example , containing a schottky barrier or p - n junction ) which is often used to avoid dc current and thus to simplify the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "@xcite    during the first period of the transient spectroscopy experiment ,  @xcite the forward bias is applied to the emitter , and all qws are filled by electrons with the equilibrium sheet density @xmath4 . in the second period , a large reverse bias @xmath5 is applied to extract electrons from the qws , and transient current is recorded .",
    "the problem has some similarities with the treatment presented for the kinetics of electron packet in a system of undoped qws .",
    "immediately after the application of @xmath5 , the electric field in the qw structure is uniform and given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the built - in voltage between the emitter and collector , and @xmath8 is the structure thickness .",
    "this field causes fast removal of delocalized electrons from the structure at almost fixed @xmath9 .",
    "this is a very fast ( on a ps time scale ) component of the transient current @xcite limited by carrier capture and transit times , which is manifested as an instantaneous current step in the case of limited time resolution of a measurement setup",
    ". we shall be interested here in a subsequent slow current relaxation caused by the qw recharging .",
    "the initial part of this relaxation ( after completion of the fast transient ) can be easily calculated .    in the presence of external illumination",

    "this restriction is not compulsory since all analytical formulae are applicable for an arbitrary relation between the optical and thermal generation .",
    "we assume that the carriers emitted from the qws drift with a constant velocity @xmath19 towards the collector .",
    "while traversing a qw , carriers are captured by the qw with a probability @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "carriers emitted from the @xmath22-th qw give the following contribution to the carrier concentration in the @xmath10-th barrier ( between @xmath10-th and @xmath23-th qws ) : @xmath24 the total concentration in the @xmath10-th barrier @xmath25 @xmath26 since the change of a qw charge is determined by the balance between carrier capture and emission , we can , with the help of eq .",

    "this means that @xmath32 is no longer constant but changes from point to point in an unknown way so that the behaviour of @xmath28 remains unknown .",

    "@xcite in general , the time constant for the transient current @xmath41 is determined not only by the emission time @xmath50 , but also by a transport parameter @xmath51 similarly to the case of dlts for a very high concentration of deep centers.@xcite particularly , in the case @xmath52 we have @xmath53 .",

    "the model presented above is justified only for the initial part of the transient , since we neglected the modulation of the electric field due to the qw recharging . to check this model and to obtain a description of the transient current for a wider time interval",

    "the capture probability was chosen to be @xmath70 so that @xmath71 . the initial part of the transient ( @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74s is the position of the first step in fig .",
    "2(a ) ) is very well described by an exponential function with the amplitude and time constant calculated by our analytical model without any fitting parameters .",
    "the time constant obtained is @xmath75  @xmath74s , while the emission time is somewhat smaller , @xmath76  @xmath74s .",
    "starting from the time moment @xmath77 , the transient current decays more rapidly , and displays a series of steps and shoulders .",

    "using eq .",

    "2 this estimate gives @xmath83  @xmath74s , which is in a good agreement with the results of numerical calculations ( @xmath73  @xmath74s ) .",
    "since @xmath84 ( unless @xmath49 is very small ) , only a small initial part of the transient process is described by the exponential function with time constant @xmath41 and amplitude @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the fitting of experimental data by an exponential function to extract the time constant @xmath41 should be done over the interval @xmath85 .",

    "it should be stressed that the measurement circuit should have @xmath87-time constant ( @xmath88 is the load resistance and @xmath89 is the qw structure high - frequency capacitance ) much smaller than time constant @xmath81 for correct evaluation of @xmath41 .",
    "to check the influence of the qw capture velocity @xmath90 on the time constant @xmath41 , we simulated the transient response for different values of @xmath90 .",

    "( [ i(0)]),([tau ] ) proves the validity of the analytical model .",
    "so far we have assumed that the photoionization cross - section ( or emission rate ) is independent of the local electric field .",
    "while this is a good approximation for bound - to - continuum transitions , the photoionization cross section for bound - to - bound and bound - to - quasi - bound transitions depends strongly on electric field .",
    "@xcite to investigate this effect , we compared the results of simulation for the cases of field - dependent and field - independent cross - section ( see fig .  4 ) .",

    "@xcite the values @xmath96  mev and @xmath97  mev also taken from ref .  , were used .",
    "it is seen from fig .  4 that the field dependence of cross - section washes out steps on the @xmath28 curve .",
    "moreover , the initial part of the curve , @xmath98 deviates significantly from an exponential function of the analytical model .",
    "physically , this is caused by the decrease of the photoemission current from near - collector qws due to the electric field redistribution .",
    "this effect makes the extraction procedure of the time constant @xmath41 from the slope of the transient current more complicated .",
    "however , the transient current amplitude @xmath40 is not affected by the field redistribution . since the amplitude is directly related to the photoemission current ( @xmath99 ) in the case @xmath54 , we propose to use the amplitude of the transient current rather than its slope to extract the photoionization cross - section from experimental data .",
