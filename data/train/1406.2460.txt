    "we remark that there are two obvious differences between the experiments .",
    "firstly , the sample quality is very different as quantified by the residual resistivity value @xmath79 of 10 and @xmath80 cm , respectively .",
    "possibly , for samples # 2,#3 magnetic disorder makes a large contribution to @xmath81 , which can be reduced by the magnetic field resulting in a negative @xmath82 .",
    "the second difference is the measurement geometry , _ i.e. _ transversal ( @xmath83 for sample # 1 ) _ versus _ longitudinal ( @xmath84 for samples # 2,#3 ) magnetoresistance , since the lorentz force on the current in general leads to more scattering and a positive @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , in the transverse configuration the charge carriers will scatter more effectively from the magnetic moments and the predominantly longitudinal spin fluctuations , compared to the longitudinal configuration where the current and @xmath1 are aligned . these differences in sample quality and measurement geometry",
    "might also explain the slightly different @xmath2-values extracted from fig .  1 ( @xmath85  t ) and fig .  3 ( @xmath86  t ) at ambient pressure",
    ". the large variation of @xmath82 with the @xmath10-value and geometry is uncommon and its understanding is highly relevant in view of the strongly anisotropic magnetic properties of ucoge .",
    "measurements in the transverse geometry with @xmath43 have not appeared in the literature so far , while longitudinal ( @xmath14-axis ) magnetoresistance data have been reported on two samples of different quality : ( _ i _ ) a magnetoresistance trace taken on a sample with @xmath27 at @xmath87  k shows a weak initially positive @xmath82 with a small structure near @xmath88  t and three additional kink - like features in the field range 17 - 30  t ( ref .  ) , and ( _ ii _ ) the magnetoresistance of a sample with @xmath89 has an overall negative @xmath82 with a kink at @xmath90 or @xmath88  t ( ref .  ) , as in our fig .  3 . in the latter study",
    "the angular variation of @xmath2 , measured at @xmath87  k by tilting the field from the @xmath14-axis towards an arbitrary direction in the @xmath91-plane , was also found to follow the @xmath92-law .",
    "an appealing scenario that has been put forward to explain the change in magnetoresistance at @xmath2 is a ferro - to - ferrimagnetic transition  @xcite .",
    "this proposal is largely based on a recent polarized neutron diffraction experiment on ucoge carried out for @xmath43  @xcite . in low magnetic field",
    "( 3  t ) the small ordered moment @xmath1 is predominantly located at the u atom , but in a large field of 12  t a substantial moment , antiparallel to the u moment , is induced on the co site .",
    "this unusual polarizability of the co @xmath93 orbitals may give rise to a field - induced ferri - magnetic - like spin arrangement .",
    "support for this scenario was obtained by field - dependent ac - susceptibility data  @xcite which exhibit a maximum near @xmath2 .",
    "recently , the dc - magnetization @xmath94 was measured at @xmath95  k in pulsed magnetic fields up to 52  t  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath43 the data do not show a clear sign of a ( meta)magnetic transition , however , a weak structure appears near @xmath2 in the derivative @xmath96 , and a second change of slope occurs near 23.5  t. sensitive torque cantilever experiments might be helpful to resolve the possibly anomalous behavior of the magnetization around @xmath2 .",
    "further arguments in favor of a magnetic transition are : ( _ i _ ) the uniaxial ( ising - type ) behavior of the ferromagnetic order is reflected in @xmath2 , and ( _ ii _ ) the pressure variation of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is large and has a magnitude comparable to the pressure dependence of @xmath6  @xcite assuming 1  k @xmath97  t per @xmath98 ( the critical pressure for the suppression of ferromagnetic order is 1.4  gpa ) . in this scenario",
    "the pressure increase of @xmath2 may be related to the reduced polarizability of the co moment under pressure .",
    "another possible origin of the structure in @xmath82 near @xmath2 is a lifshitz transition , _",
    "i.e. _ a field - induced topological change of the fermi surface .",
    "notably it has been suggested that the multitude of small kink - like features observed in @xmath82 for @xmath84 at @xmath87  k could hint at a fermi surface reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "quantum oscillations have been reported for ucoge for @xmath28 but could not be detected for a field direction along or close to the @xmath14-axis .",
    "a second indication for the possibility of a field - induced fermi surface modification comes from thermoelectric power data  @xcite , which show two pronounced peaks at 11.1 and 14.6  t for @xmath28 .",
    "while the former peak is associated with field - reinforced superconductivity , the latter peak and the ensuing sign change of the thermopower provide evidence for a topological change of the fermi surface . in the related material",
    "urhge the field - induced disappearance of a small fermi - surface pocket was recently demonstrated by quantum oscillations measurements  @xcite .",
    "overall , the ising - like nature of the ferromagnetic ground state results in a complex magnetotransport behavior . moreover , the magnetization  @xcite , thermal expansion  @xcite , thermoelectric power  @xcite and thermal conductivity  @xcite all have a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy , which makes it difficult to unravel the behavior of ucoge . however , at the positive side , it is the strong anisotropy that results in longitudinal ferromagnetic fluctuations that play a major role in inducing spin - triplet superconductivity  @xcite",
    ". a greater understanding of the anisotropy is therefore likely to be important for our understanding of the superconductivity .",
    "the unusual superconducting behavior is demonstrated by the @xmath3 curve reported in fig .  5 .",
    "we recall the upward curvature for @xmath75  t and the large value of 17  t in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "the sample ( # 1 ) used here comes from the same single - crystalline batch as used in our first measurements of the upper critical field ( ref .  ) , where @xmath99 was found to reach a value of 5  t for @xmath28 .",
    "this discrepancy can now be attributed to a small misorientation of @xmath100 ( see the inset in fig .  5 ) .",
    "the precise orientation of the sample with respect to the magnetic field direction remains an absolutely crucial feature for the behavior of this material .",
    "the field - reinforced superconductivity appears to be connected to critical spin fluctuations associated with a field - induced quantum critical point , where the latter is reached by the suppression of the curie temperature in strong magnetic fields for @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "a second , more recently , proposed cause for the field - reinforced superconductivity is a lifshitz transition  @xcite",
    ". finally , we mention the progress made in modeling the intricate and anisotropic @xmath3 of ucoge by a strong - coupling eliasbergh model exploiting the ising - type spin fluctuations  @xcite and by the completely broken symmetry scenario for parallel - spin @xmath101-wave superconductors  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented an extensive angle dependent magnetoresistance study on single crystals of ucoge for fields directed in the @xmath25- and @xmath26-planes of the orthorhombic unit cell .",
    "we pinpoint a pronounced structure in the magnetoresistance , which takes place when the component of the field along the @xmath14-axis reaches a value @xmath0  t. this behavior is very pronounced for transverse measurement geometry and rather weak for longitudinal geometry .",
    "measurements of @xmath2 as a function of pressure show a rapid increase of @xmath2 to 12.8  t at @xmath102  gpa .",
    "the uniaxial nature of @xmath2 and its large pressure variation are consistent with the interpretation that the change in the magnetoresistance regime at @xmath2 is related to an unusual polarizability of the u and co moments .",
    "transport measurements in fixed magnetic fields confirm the unusual s - shaped @xmath3-behavior after carefully aligning the sample along the field @xmath28 . in order to further unravel the intriguing properties of ucoge , notably with respect to the close connection between field - induced phenomena , such as a quantum critical point or lifshitz transition , and superconductivity",
