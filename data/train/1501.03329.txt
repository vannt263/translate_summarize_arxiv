    ", qed@xmath0 is a superrenormalizable field theory and therefore free of ultraviolet divergence .",
    "extensive investigations have found that qed@xmath0 exhibits a number of interesting physical properties , such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) @xcite , asymptotic freedom @xcite , and permanent confinement @xcite .",
    "apparently , qed@xmath0 is more like four - dimensional qcd than qed@xmath2 .",
    "for this reason , qed@xmath0 is often considered as a toy model of qcd@xmath2 in the context of particle physics .",
    "more interestingly , qed@xmath0 has proven in the past twenty years to be an effective low - energy model for several strongly correlated condensed - matter systems , including high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors @xcite , spin-@xmath4 kagome spin liquid @xcite , graphene @xcite , quantum critical systems @xcite , and kane - mele model with weak - extended hubbard interaction @xcite .",
    "although qed@xmath0 can be well controlled in the ultraviolet regime , it encounters infrared problems since both dirac fermions and u(1 ) gauge field are massless .",
    "for instance , the theory exhibits infrared divergence if the free gauge boson propagator is utilized in the perturbative calculations .",
    "_ showed that such an infrared divergence can be naturally erased by including dynamical screening effect of massless fermions into the effective gauge boson propagator @xcite .",
    "based on this scheme , appelquist _",
    "@xcite investigated the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) of fermion self - energy function , and found that the massless fermions acquire a finite dynamical mass , which induces dcsb , when their flavor is below certain threshold , @xmath5 .",
    "most of the existing analytical and numerical calculations @xcite agree that the critical flavor is @xmath6 at zero temperature .    in the application of qed@xmath0 to condensed matter systems ,",
    "dcsb is usually interpreted as the formation of heisenberg quantum antiferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "it was found that dcsb in qed@xmath0 with finite gauge boson mass can still appear if the mass of the gauge boson is not large enough @xcite .",
    "this model can describe the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in high - temperature cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the fate of dynamical mass generation at finite temperature @xcite has also attracted considerable interest .",
    "notice that finite temperature qed@xmath0 is not only interesting from the viewpoint of quantum field theory , but of practical value since qed@xmath0 has wide applications in condensed matter physics .",
    "an important problem is to estimate the critical temperature @xmath3 at which dynamical mass generation is destroyed by thermal fluctuation .",
    "unfortunately , the study of dynamical mass generation at finite temperature seems to be more difficult than the case of zero temperature .",
    "a main obstacle is that the lorentz invariance is explicitly broken at finite temperature .",
    "the integration over 3-momenta @xmath7 that appears in the dse is replaced by an integration over 2-momenta @xmath8 and a summation over imaginary frequency @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mastubara frequency with @xmath11 being an integer . as a consequence ,",
    "the dse becomes much more complicated , so it is usually necessary to make certain approximations to perform algebraic calculations .",
    "a number of different approximations have been proposed to study dynamical mass generation in finite temperature qed@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the most frequently used one is the so - called instantaneous approximation , which assumes that the gauge boson propagator is completely independent of energy , @xmath12 in previous works @xcite , the transverse component of gauge boson propagator , @xmath13 , is usually ignored on top of the instantaneous approximation , i.e. , @xmath14 under these approximations , the dse for fermion mass becomes much simpler and can be easily solved . however , as showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transverse component of gauge boson propagator @xmath13 , if incorporated in the dse , induces an infrared divergence at finite temperature . to obtain convergent results ,",
    "lee proposed to simply neglect the contribution from @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , neglecting the transverse component of gauge boson propagator is actually problematic .",
    "an important reason for qed@xmath0 to exhibit dynamical fermion mass generation is that the gauge interaction is long - ranged , which is guaranteed by the gauge invariance .",
    "if the gauge boson acquires a finite mass , the dynamical fermion mass generation will be strongly suppressed @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "the lorentz invariance is explicitly broken , then the longitudinal and transverse components of gauge boson propagator behave very differently @xcite : the former becomes short - ranged due to thermal screening , whereas the latter remains long - ranged as a consequence of gauge invariance .",
    "therefore , the transverse component of gauge boson propagator should play more significant role than the longitudinal component at finite temperatures .",
    "this judgement is supported by the extensive recent analysis of nontrivial properties induced by gauge interaction @xcite .",
    "overall , the transverse component of gauge boson propagator needs to be included in an appropriate manner in the study of dynamical fermion mass generation at finite temperature , which is the motivation of our work .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the issue of dynamical mass generation in finite temperature qed@xmath0 . in order to obtain physically meaningful results ,",
    "we go beyond the widely used instantaneous approximation , and employ a new approximation that ignores the energy dependence of dynamical fermion mass , i.e. , @xmath15 , but maintains both the longitudinal and transverse components of gauge boson propagator .",
    "different form the instantaneous approximation , the new approximation does not completely neglect the energy dependence of the gauge boson . after performing extensive numerical computations",
    ", we find that the dynamical fermion mass is free of divergence under the new approximation .",
    "we also examine the validity of the new approximation by comparing to the case of zero temperature , and show that it is better than the instantaneous approximation .    as aforementioned",
    ", qed@xmath0 can serve as an effective low - energy field theory for several condensed matter systems @xcite . in these systems",
    ", there are always certain amount of disorders , which couple to massless fermions and induce a finite damping rate .",
    "disorders are responsible to the anomalous behaviors of a plenty of observable quantities of interacting systems of dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is also interesting to study dynamical mass generation of qed@xmath0 in the presence of disorders .",
    "to describe the influence of disorders , a finite fermion damping rate @xmath16 is introduced to the fermion propagator ref .",
    "as will be shown below , @xmath16 plays analogous role as temperature @xmath17 , so its effect on dynamical mass generation can be studied in a similar manner to the case of finite temperature .",
