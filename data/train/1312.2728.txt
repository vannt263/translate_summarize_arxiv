    "it is now universally accepted that pulsars are neutron stars ( nss ) with extremely strong magnetic fields .",
    "the surface magnetic field manifests itself as synchrotron radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere , where the field magnitude for young nss has been estimated to be @xmath4 g. the internal magnetic field is expected to be even higher @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is the main energy source of all the persistent and bursting emission observed in anomalous x - ray pulsars(axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs)@xcite . axps and sgrs are considered to be magnetar candidates , namely isolated neutron stars powered by the decay of huge ( @xmath5 = 4.414 @xmath6 g ) magnetic fields inferred from the rotation under the so - called ` standard assumption ' : @xmath7 dynamo @xcite .",
    "their common properties are : stochastic outbursts ( lasting from days to years ) during which they emit very short x/@xmath8- ray bursts ; rotational periods in a narrow range @xmath9(6- 12 ) s ; compared to other isolated neutron stars , large period derivatives of @xmath10 s  s@xmath11 ; rather soft ( at least for axps ) x - ray spectra that can be fitted by the sum of a black body ( @xmath12 0.5 kev ) and a power law component ( power law index @xmath132- 4 ) , and , in some cases , associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite .    up to now ( 3 october 2010 ) ,",
    "there are nine sgrs ( seven conformed)and twelve axps ( nine conformed ) detected , so statistically investigating their persistent parameters is available .",
    "observationally , all known magnetars are x - ray pulsars with luminosities of @xmath14 erg  s@xmath11 @xcite , their high luminosities together with the lack of evidence for accretion from a stellar companion , result in the conclusion that the energy reservoir fueling the magnetar activity is their superhigh magnetic fields ( @xmath15 ) g @xcite .",
    "such a huge energy reservoir ( @xmath16 erg ) is sufficient to power not only the persistent surface x - ray emission but also a steady stream of low - amplitude alfven waves into the magnetosphere for @xmath17 yrs @xcite .    in order to provide a detailed view of the actual evolution of a magnetar",
    ", we should consider the effective electron capture rate @xmath18 ( the effective number of electrons captured by one proton per second ) due to the existence of the landau levels of charged particles @xcite .",
    "however , only the electrons occupying large landau levels with high energy ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the threshold of energy ) are allowed to participate in the process @xmath21 @xcite . in other words , whether an electron could be captured depends not only on the electron s energy @xmath22 but also on the number of the landau level it occupies .",
    "based on the assumption of the landau level effect coefficient @xmath23 , we define the effective electron capture rate @xmath18 as : @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "with respect to the electron fermi energy @xmath25 , our point of view is that in the case of an intense magnetic field , the stronger the magnetic field , the higher the electron fermi energy released from the magnetic field energy @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath26 2 a review on the evolution of superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars is given ; in @xmath26 3 we investigate the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath1 , and gain a schematic diagram of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath1 ; in @xmath26 4 a second - order differential equation for a superhigh field and its evolutionary timescale is given ; discussions and conclusions are presented in @xmath26 5 ; in appendix @xmath28 we consider the effect of a superhigh magnetic field on the proton fraction @xmath29 and gain a concise formula of @xmath25 , and in appendix @xmath1 we give an explanation for why a wrong notion that @xmath25 decreases with increasing @xmath1 is used as yet .",
    "the evolution of magnetic fields of a magnetar is a rather challenging subject , with strong observational clues and involving complex physics .",
    "the strong evidences for spontaneous evolution of magnetic fields inside magnetars are mainly that : sgrs and axps appear to radiate substantially more power than available from their rotational energy loss ; the dipole field inferred from the observed torque is stronger than that of all other nss , @xmath30 g , which make it nature to accept the argument of thompson @xmath31 duncan ( 1992 ) that these sources are in fact ` magnetars ' , powered by the dissipation of their magnetic energy ; and torque changes of both signs , associated with outbursts from these sources , etc . in order to explain the evolution of superhigh magnetic fields inside magnetars ,",
    "different models have been proposed recently , as partly listed below .    in the twisting magnetic field model , the magnetic field",
    "is supposed to be dominated by a toroidal component larger than the external dipole .",
    "the persistent quiescent x - ray emission of a magnetars could be brought out by the twisting of the external magnetic field caused by the motions of the star interior .",
    "the twisting crustal motions generally drive currents outside a magnetar , and generate x - rays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a discussion about the globally - twisted magnetosphere was proposed by thompson et al ( 2002 ) . however , up to now , a quantitative calculation of x - ray luminosity in the twisting magnetic field model is still up in the air .    in the thermal evolution model ,",
    "the main points of view include : the field could decay directly as a result of the non - zero resistivity of the matter ohmic decay or ambipolar diffusion , or indirectly as a result of hall drift producing a cascade of the field to high wave number components , which decay quickly through ohmic decay @xcite ; magnetic field decay can be a main source of internal heating ; the enhanced thermal conductivity in the strongly magnetized envelope contributes to raise the surface temperature @xcite , etc .    in currently existing magnetar models ,",
    "the evolution timescale of superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars is estimated just according to conservation of energy , rather than depending on an accurate equation of @xmath1 and its evolution timescale t. for example , a strong dependence of neutron star surface temperature on the dipolar component of the magnetic field @xmath32 for stars with @xmath33 g reveals that the thermal evolution is almost fully controlled by the amount of magnetic field energy the star has stored in its crust by the time the star has reached an age of @xmath34 yrs ( earlier , for magnetars ) @xcite .",
    "one more example , while the field decay is governed by ohmic dissipation and hall drift , the most interrelated process inside a magnetar is ambipolar diffusion , which has a characteristic timescale @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the core magnetic field @xcite . in this article , unlike the previous magnetar model , we calculate the decay timescale of superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars by employing the landau level effect coefficient @xmath23 and the effective electron capture rate @xmath18 @xcite . for further details ,",
    "see @xmath26 4 .    with respect to the origin of superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars ,",
    "a more popular hypothesis is that magnetars are formed from rapidly rotating proto - neutron stars , differential rotation and convection would result in an efficient @xmath37 dynamo @xcite .",
    "the dynamo responsible for the superhigh magnetic field generation requires that magnetars be born with ultrashort initial spin periods @xmath381 ms , the associated free energy is @xmath39 erg , and the magnified field is as strong as @xmath40 g @xcite .",
    "however , there is as yet no mechanism to explain such a high efficiency of energy transformation . when investigating solar flare using the @xmath37 model , apart from the difficulty in explaining such a high energy transformation efficiency , there are also many other problems to be settled at present .",
    "note , up to now , there is no observational indication on the existence of fields @xmath41 g in the interior of a ns .",
    "furthermore , the explosion energies of these supernova remnants associated with axps and sgrs ( axp 1e 1841 - 045 , axp 1e 2259 + 586 , and sgr 0526 - 26 ) , are near to the canonical supernova explosion energies of @xmath42 erg , suggesting @xmath43 5 ms @xcite . enough has been said to show that @xmath37 dynamo is a mere assumption , laking observational support .",
    "although the origin of superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars , as mentioned above , is uncertain , a possible mechanism that superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars originate from the induced magnetic fields at a moderate lower temperature , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is universally supposed that @xmath0 anisotropic neutron superfluid could exist in the interior of a ns , where the mean thermal kinetic energy of nucleons is far less than nucleon interaction energy ( in the order of @xmath44 1 mev ) due to strong nucleon - nucleon attractive interaction ( the mean distance of nucleons is @xmath451 fm ) .",
    "it is this strong nucleon- nucleon interaction of attraction that results in the formations of proton cooper pairs and @xmath0 anisotropic neutron cooper pairs .",
    "the nucleonic @xmath0 pairing gaps in nss have been investigated by elgar@xmath46y et al ( 1996 ) in detail .",
    "their important results may be briefly summarized as follows :    @xmath47 the @xmath0 neutron pair energy gap @xmath48 appears in the region 1.32 @xmath49 ( fm@xmath11)@xmath51 2.34 , where @xmath48 is an increasing function of the density for the region 1.32 @xmath49(fm@xmath11 ) @xmath51 1.8 and it is a rapidly decreasing function of the density for the region 2.1 @xmath52 ( fm@xmath11)@xmath51 2.34 , where @xmath53 is the fermi wave number of the neutrons .",
    "@xmath54 the maximum of the @xmath0 neutron pair energy gap @xmath55is about 0.048 mev at @xmath53= 1.96 fm@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath56 @xmath48 is almost a constant about the maximum with error less than @xmath57 in the rather wide range 1.8 @xmath58 ( fm@xmath11)@xmath51 2.1 , corresponding to the density region 3.3 @xmath59 ( g  @xmath605.2 @xmath61 .",
    "based on the analysis above , the critical temperature of the @xmath0 neutron cooper pairs can be evaluated as follows:@xmath62 2.78@xmath63k , the maximum of internal temperature @xmath64 ( rather than the maximum of core temperature ) can not exceed @xmath65 according to our model @xcite .",
    "a ns is often approximately considered as a system of magnetic dipoles because of the existence of @xmath0 anisotropic neutron superfluid in its interior . in the presence of a background magnetic field ,",
    "the dipoles have a tendency to be aligned along the direction of this field .",
    "if temperature falls below a critical temperature , a phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism could occur , which provides a possible explanation for superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars .",
    "the maximum induced magnetic field is estimated to be ( 3.0 @xmath44 4.0)@xmath66 g @xcite .    in the case of",
    "field - free , for the direct urca reactions to take place , there exists the following inequality among the fermi momenta of the proton ( @xmath67 ) , the electron ( @xmath68 ) and the neutron ( @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 required by momentum conservation near the fermi surface . together with the charge neutrality condition , the above inequality brings about the threshold for proton concentration @xmath71 = 0.11 , this means that , in the field - free case , direct urca reactions are strongly suppressed in the degenerate @xmath72 system ( baiko & yakovlev 1999 ; lai & shapiro 1991 ; leinson & p@xmath73rez . 1997 ; yakovlev et al 2001 ) . however , when in a superhigh magnetic field @xmath74 , things could be quite different .",
    "a superhigh magnetic field can generate a noticeable magnetic broadening of the direct urca process threshold , as well as of the thresholds of other reactions in the interior of a magnetar @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field is large enough for protons and electrons to be confined to the lowest landau levels ( @xmath75=0 , 1 ) , the field - free threshold condition on proton concentration no longer holds , and direct urca reactions are open for an arbitrary proton concentration ( leinson & p@xmath73rez .",
    "strong magnetic field can alter matter compositions and increase phase pace for protons which leads to the increase of @xmath76 @xcite . by strongly modifying the phase spaces of protons and electrons , ultrastrong magnetic fields ( @xmath77 g ) can cause a substantial @xmath78 conversion , as a result , the system is converted to highly proton - rich matter with distinctively softer equation of states , compared to the field - free case@xcite .",
    "though magnetic fields of such magnitude inside nss are unauthentic , and are not consistent with our model ( @xmath79 g ) , their calculations are useful in supporting our assumption : direct urca reactions are expected to occur inside a magnetar . according to our model ,",
    "as soon as the energy of electrons near the fermi surface are higher than the fermi energy of neutrons ( @xmath80 60 mev see chapter 11 of shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , the process @xmath81 will dominate . by colliding with the neutrons produced in the process of @xmath82 ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the outgoing neutrons will be transformed into thermal energy and then transformed into the radiation energy with x - ray and soft @xmath8-ray @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 cooper pairs will be destroyed quickly by these high - energy outgoing neutrons .",
    "thus the anisotropic superfluid and the superhigh magnetic fields induced by the @xmath0 cooper pairs will disappear .",
    "this section is composed of two subsections . for each subsection",
    "we present different methods and considerations .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , in the presence of an extremely strong magnetic field , the electrons are situated in disparate energy states in order one by one from the lowest energy state up to the fermi energy ( the highest energy ) with the highest momentum @xmath83 along the magnetic field , according to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "-axis direction , the energy levels perpendicular to the direction of applied magnetic field are quantized .",
    "the radius of the cross section is @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the momentum along @xmath86-axis direction . ]    in the interior of a magnetar , different forms of intense magnetic field could exist simultaneously and a high @xmath25 could be generated by the release of magnetic field energy .",
    "when @xmath74 , the landau column becomes a very long and very narrow cylinder along the magnetic field , the electron fermi energy is determined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are three non - dimensional variables , which are defined as @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ; @xmath94 is the modification factor ; @xmath95 6.02 @xmath96 is the avogadro constant ; @xmath97 , here @xmath76 , @xmath29 , @xmath98 and @xmath28 are the electron fraction , the proton fraction , the proton number and nucleon number of a given nucleus , respectively @xcite . from eq.(2 ) , we gain the relations of @xmath25 vs. @xmath1 and @xmath25 vs. @xmath99 , which are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    seeing from fig.2 , it s obvious that @xmath25 increases with the increase in @xmath1 when @xmath99 and @xmath76 are given ;",
    "@xmath25 also increases with the increasing @xmath99 when @xmath1 and @xmath76 are given .",
    "the high fermi energy of electrons could be from the release of the magnetic energy .",
    "a possible interpretation of high @xmath25 is given as follows : an envelope of the landau circles with maximum quantum number @xmath100 will approximately form a sphere , i.e. fermi sphere . for a given electron number density with a highly degenerate state in the interior of a ns ,",
    "the stronger the magnetic field , the larger the maximum of @xmath85 is , hence the lower the number of states in the @xmath101 plane according to the pauli exclusion principle . in other words , @xmath102 and the number of electrons in the @xmath101 plane decrease with the increase of @xmath1 ,",
    "the radius of the fermi sphere @xmath103 is expanded which implies that the electron fermi energy @xmath25 also increases .",
    "the higher the fermi energy @xmath25 , the more obvious the ` expansion ' of the fermi sphere is , however , the majority of the momentum space in the fermi sphere is empty for not being occupied by electrons .",
    "however , one incorrect notion that @xmath25 decreases with increasing @xmath1 in an intense field ( @xmath104 ) has been universally adopted for a long time . with respect to this incorrect notion ,",
    "further details are presented in appendix @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that at zero - temperature the ns is @xmath105-stable , but at non - zero temperature ( @xmath106 , @xmath1071.38 @xmath108 erg   k@xmath11 is the boltzmann constant ) , reactions @xmath109 and @xmath110 proceed near the fermi energies @xmath111 of the participating particles .",
    "the electron capture rates can be calculated as follows : @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 60 mev , @xmath115 0.018 ( mev)@xmath116 s@xmath11 , @xmath25 = 40@xmath117 mev ( c.f .",
    "gao et al 2010a and appendix @xmath28 of this paper ) , and other terms appearing in eqs.(3 - 4 ) have already been defined in chapter 18 of @xcite . in this paper , for the purpose of convenient calculation , we set @xmath118 . the range of @xmath1 is assumed to be ( 2.2346 @xmath119 3.0 @xmath120 ) g corresponding to @xmath121(60 @xmath44114.85 ) mev , where 2.2346 @xmath122 g is the minimum of @xmath1 denoted as @xmath123 .",
    "when @xmath1 drops below @xmath123 , the direct urca process is quenched everywhere in the magnetar interior@xcite .",
    "combining the relation @xmath124 with the relation @xmath125 gives the mean kinetic energy of neutrons .",
    "the average x - ray luminosity @xmath126 can be expressed as follows : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the landau level effect coefficient , @xmath129 denotes the volume of @xmath0 anisotropic neutron superfluid ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath131= 9.6 @xmath132 @xmath133 . for a magnetar with initial magnetic field @xmath134= 3.0 @xmath135 g ,",
    "if its initial x - ray luminosity @xmath136 is assumed to be ( 1.0@xmath449.0)@xmath137 erg   s@xmath11 , then @xmath128 is estimated to be ( 0.216 @xmath44 1.94)@xmath138 and the initial effective electron capture rate is ( 0.221 @xmath44 1.98)@xmath139 s@xmath11 .",
    "we can also construct a schematic diagram of the average x - ray luminosity as a function of magnetic field for the process of electron capture , which is shown as in fig.4 .",
    "as discussed above , the decay of magnetic fields is the ultimate energy source of all the persistent and bursting emission observed in axps and sgrs . in table 1 ,",

    "the assumption that @xmath0 anisotropic neutron superfluid could exist in the interior of a ns is supported by the data of column 3 in table 1 .",
    "the inverse @xmath105-decay and related reactions in superhigh magnetic fields have been studied since late 1960 s @xcite .",

    "it is easy to imagine that the neutrino flux comes from the thermal energy in the magnetar interior , rather than from the free energy of the superhigh magnetic field .",
    "why should we say this ?",
    "results of our analysis appear below : in the interior of a ns , the majority of fermions are situated in the bottom of fermi sea @xcite , their energies are far less than their fermi energies , only in this case can we write @xmath161 ; however , in the vicinity of fermi surface , there are but few fermions with energies @xmath156 .",
    "we must bear in mind that the minimum of @xmath162 of the outgoing neutrons in the process of electron capture is no less than the neutron fermi energy ( @xmath163 60 mev @xcite ) , otherwise the outgoing neutrons can not escape from the surface of fermi sea , thus the inverse @xmath105-decay will not occur . in the interior of a magnetar where the direct urca reaction takes place , neutrons can be sorted into two kinds according to their energies : low- energy neutrons with thermal kinetic energy @xmath164 and high- energy outgoing neutrons with energy @xmath165 , for neutrinos , the same are true .",
    "although the energies of outgoing neutrons and outgoing neutrinos are directly from the energies of electrons participating in direct urca reaction , @xmath126 and @xmath150 are ultimately determined by @xmath1 , rather than by @xmath64 ,",
    "the reason is that magnetic field energy is the main source of emissions , whereas @xmath64 is only equivalent to background temperature , therefore both @xmath126 and @xmath150 are just weak functions of @xmath64 . with regard to the calculations of x - ray luminosity and neutrino luminosity in superhigh magnetic fields , for further details , refer to gao et al ( 2010a ) .",
    "the magnetic field distribution of a magnetar , though attracting general attentions of researchers , still lacks a definite conclusion now .",
    "if the direct urca reaction occurs in the crust of a magnetar , the assumption of @xmath166 k is contradictory to the observational values of @xmath141 in table 1 .",
    "if the direct urca reaction occurs in the interior of a magnetar where electrons are relativistic , neutrons and protons are non - relativistic , the so - called ` standard magnitude ' of @xmath150 will be higher than @xmath167 erg  s@xmath11 at least according to our model ( see @xmath26 3.2 ) . by analyzing , we can make a comparison between the observed values ( @xmath150 and @xmath126 ) and the conventional values ( @xmath150 and @xmath126 ) : for a magnetar , a typical observed soft x - ray luminosity is about 3 @xmath132 erg  s@xmath11 @xcite , the mount of total electromagnetic radiation is about one thirtieth of that of the neutrino emissivity due to the fact that photons are partly absorbed by star internal matter,@xcite , then we obtain the neutrino emissivity @xmath168 erg  s@xmath11 ; if all emissions of a magnetar are from the modified urca reaction ( the magnitude of which is about 6-orders lower than that of the direct urca reaction ) , then the calculated value of @xmath150 is @xmath169 erg  s@xmath11 or above , which is far larger than the observed values of @xmath150(@xmath170 erg  s@xmath11 ) , and the calculated value of @xmath27 in the modified urca process is about @xmath171 erg  s@xmath11 or above , accordingly , which is far higher than the observed value of @xmath126 , where we assume that the energies of all particles participating in the process of electron capture are calculated according to our model .",
    "our model will be a challenge for the conventional way of calculating neutrino emissivity , if our analysis is reasonable .",
    "seeing from fig . 3 and table 1 , it s obvious that the soft x - ray luminosity @xmath126 of a magnetar increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , due to the existences of calculation error and observation error ( for example , we ignore the x - ray loss due to being absorbed by star internal matter ) , there are still differences between calculations and observations . how to improve our model to make calculations agree well with observations will be considered in our future work . despite these previous researches , existing analysis is approximate and many assumptions are invoked consequently , because our computational methods are completely new approaches , that need to be validated empirically .",

    "as we know , in the case of field - free , for reactions @xmath231 and @xmath232 to take place , there exists the following inequality among the fermi momenta of the proton(@xmath67 ) , the electron ( @xmath68)and the neutron ( @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 required by momentum conservation near the fermi surface , @xmath29 is the proton fraction , defined as the mean proton number per baryon .",
    "together with the charge neutrality condition , the above inequality brings about the threshold for proton concentration @xmath2331/9 , this means that , in the field - free case , direct urca reactions are strongly suppressed by pauli blocking in a system composed of neutrons , protons , and electrons ( @xmath234 system ) . in the core of a ns , where @xmath235 g  cm@xmath11 and @xmath29 could be higher than 0.11 , direct urca processes could take place @xcite .",

    ", we find that the solution of the non - relativistic electron cyclotron motion equation @xmath255 is wrongly ( or unsuitably ) applied to calculate energy state density in a relativistic degenerate electron gas .",
    "it s interesting to note that , in the page 12 of canuto & chiu ( 1971 ) , in order to evaluate the degeneracy of the @xmath75-th landau level @xmath256 , they firstly introduce the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath257 ) where @xmath258 , then gain an approximate relation @xmath259 where @xmath260 and @xmath261@xcite . in the paper , authors stated clearly that this relation is hold only when @xmath1 = 0 , in other words , this relation is just an approximation in the case of weak magnetic field ( @xmath262 ) .",

    "is calculated unanimously using the expression @xmath263 this expression will also cause the wrong deduction : @xmath264 , which is exactly the same as that from eq.(b3 ) .",
    "the sources of the wrong deduction lie in : no consideration of the conditions of eq.(b4 ) ; the assumption that the torus located between the @xmath75-th landau level and the @xmath265-th landau level in momentum space is ascribed to the @xmath265-th landau level . for the latter ,",
    "the electron energy ( or momentum ) will change continuously in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , which is contradictory to the quantization of energy ( or momentum ) in the presence of superhigh magnetic field .",
    "actually , electrons are relativistic and degenerate in the interior of a ns , so that eq.(b1 ) and eq.(b2 ) are no longer applicable , and need to be modified . considering this ,",
