    "the experimental realization of dilute degenerate bose and fermi gases has led to an explosion of activities in the field of cold atom gases . a particularly intriguing feature of atomic bose and fermi gases is that their interaction strengths can be tuned experimentally through the application of an external magnetic field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "this external knob allows dilute systems with essentially any interaction strength , including infinitely strongly attractive and repulsive interactions , to be realized .",
    "feshbach resonances have been experimentally observed for @xmath0- , @xmath6- and @xmath7-wave interacting gases  @xcite and have been predicted to exist also for higher partial waves .",
    "a feshbach resonance arises due to the coupling of two born - oppenheimer potential curves coupled through a hyperfine hamiltonian , and requires , in general , a multi - channel description . for @xmath0-wave",
    "interacting systems , feshbach resonances can be classified as broad or narrow  @xcite . whether a resonance is broad or narrow depends on whether the energy width of the resonance is large or small compared to the characteristic energy scale , such as the fermi energy or the harmonic oscillator energy , of the system .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0-wave resonances , higher partial wave resonances are necessarily narrow due to the presence of the angular momentum barrier  @xcite .",
    "this paper uses an effective single channel description to investigate the behaviors of strongly - interacting bose and fermi systems with different orbital angular momenta .    in dilute homogeneous bose and fermi gases with large @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1",
    ", a regime has been identified in which the energy per particle takes on a universal value which is set by a single length scale , the average interparticle spacing @xmath2  @xcite . in this so - called unitary regime ,",
    "the length scales of the @xmath0-wave interacting system separate according to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the range of the two - body potential .",
    "the energy per particle @xmath10 ( the subscripts `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' stand respectively for `` boson '' and `` @xmath0-wave interacting '' ) for a homogeneous one - component gas of bosons with mass @xmath13 in the unitary regime has been calculated to be @xmath14 using the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) method  @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath10 at unitarity is thus independent of @xmath1 and @xmath9 , and depends on the single length scale @xmath2 through the boson number density @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "however , bose gases in the large scattering length limit are expected to be unstable due to three - body recombination  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",

    "we find that the energy of @xmath6-wave interacting two - component bose gases and @xmath7-wave interacting one- and two - component bose gases at unitary is determined by the combined length @xmath5 . while bose gases with higher angular momentum in the unitary regime are of theoretical interest , they are , like their @xmath0-wave cousin , expected to be unstable .",

    "this allows the many - body problem to be reduced to solving an effective two - body equation with properly chosen constraints .",
    "imposing these constraints makes the method non - variational , i.e. , the resulting energy does not place an upper bound on the many - body energy .",
