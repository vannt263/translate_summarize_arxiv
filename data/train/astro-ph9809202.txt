    "it is widely believed that the distribution of galaxies is different from the overall distribution of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "this difference , _ the bias _ , is crucial for comparisons between observations and predictions of cosmological models .",
    "observations provide information about the distribution of _ objects _ such as galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the models , however , most readily predict the evolution of the dark matter distribution , which can not be observed directly .",
    "the models , therefore , should be able to predict the distribution of _ objects _ or , conversely , predict how this distribution is different from that of the dark matter ( i.e. , the bias ) . the notion of bias",
    "was introduced by @xcite to explain the large difference in clustering strength between galaxies and abell clusters .",
    "later @xcite and @xcite applied this argument to galaxies themselves .",
    "davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) showed that the cdm model disagreed with observations , if galaxies were distributed like dark matter . however ,",
    "if a biased galaxy formation scenario was assumed , the `` galaxy '' correlations substantially exceeded the correlations of mass at all scales and agreed with observations for certain values of bias .",
    "this work was followed by other studies which tried to account for the phenomenon of galaxy bias (  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the bias can be defined and understood differently . in this paper",
    "we will use the conventional statistical definition of the bias as the ratio of the correlation functions of objects and dark matter : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the square of the _ bias function _ , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the 2-point spatial correlation functions of objects and dark matter , respectively .",
    "dependencies in the above equation indicate that in general the bias may depend on the epoch @xmath16 , scale @xmath21 , and properties of the objects such as their mass @xmath22 .",
    "it is also expected that the functional form @xmath23 depends on the cosmological model .",
    "the bias in the above definition is most closely related to the observations because the _ observed _ @xmath19 can be compared to the @xmath20 _ predicted _ within a framework of a given cosmological model .",
    "this gives an estimate of _ the amount of bias needed _ for a cosmological model to agree with observations .",
    "while it is clear that this approach can not be used to test a model , it provides some insights into the nature of bias and its evolution .",
    "for example , steidel et al . (",
    "1998 ) used the observed clustering strength of high - redshift ( @xmath24 ) lyman - break galaxies to derive the implied value of bias in different cosmological models .",
    "this value was found to be quite large in all models ( @xmath25 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of theoretical studies ( e.g. , klypin , primack & holtzman 1996 ; cole et al .",
    "1997 ; jenkins et al .",
    "1998 ; and references therein ) estimated  in different cosmological models at @xmath12 and made comparisons with accurate measurements of  from local galaxy surveys .",
    "these studies indicate that significant _ anti - bias _ ( @xmath26 ) is required for the open and flat low-  models at scales @xmath27 , while @xmath28 cluster - normalized models indicate positive bias ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "comparison of the low- and high-@xmath16 results implies that , regardless of cosmological model , the bias has decreased significantly from the early epochs to the present .",
    "the distribution of the dark matter and @xmath20 can not be observed directly .",
    "therefore , a test of a cosmological model is possible only if the model can predict the @xmath30 of observed objects .",
    "unfortunately , this is not an easy and straightforward task .",
    "first of all , we should fully understand what are the observed objects and where / how they form .",
    "the standard lore is that observed galaxies form dissipatively inside dark matter halos .",
    "the properties of galaxies will then depend on the mass of the parent halo , its spin , details of dissipative processes and mass accretion history , and other factors ( e.g. , mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to predict the type of galaxy and its properties , the relevant processes must be included in the model .",
    "however , it seems likely that in _ every _ sufficiently massive ( @xmath31 ) _ gravitationally bound _",
    "halo baryons will cool , form stars , and produce an object ressembling a galaxy ( e.g. , kauffman , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; roukema et al .",
    "1997 ; yepes et al . 1997 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy population _ as a whole _ can be then viewed as a population of _ galaxy - size _ dark matter halos .",
    "the clustering of the latter can be studied without inclusion of complicated physics ; it has been modelled using both direct numerical simulations and analytical methods .",
    "typical ingredients of the analytical models ( e.g. , matarrese et al .",
    "1997 ; moscardini et al . 1998 ; @xcite ) are the extended press - schechter formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) used to follow mass evolution of halos , analytical approximations to the non - linear clustering evolution of the dark matter ( e.g. , hamilton et al .",
    "1991 ; peacock & dodds 1994,1996 ; jain , mo & white 1995 ; smith et al .",
    "1998 ) , and a model for bias evolution ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ; matarrese et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the evolution of bias in such models can be calculated quickly which makes extensive parameter - space studies possible .",
    "the main disadvantages are large uncertainties ( especially at small , @xmath32 , scales ) introduced by bias prescriptions and limited applicability of the non - linear clustering approximations .",
    "direct numerical simulations should , ideally , predict halo - halo clustering without any additional assumptions and uncertainties .",
    "however , until very recently the predictions of numerical simulations were also quite uncertain .",
    "the main reason for the uncertainty was that dissipationless @xmath0-body simulations had been consistently failing to produce galaxy - size dark matter halos in dense environments typical for galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "recently , it was shown that this effect , known as `` the overmerging problem '' (  @xcite ; summers , davis , & evrard 1995 ) , is due mainly to the insufficient force and mass resolution of such simulations ( moore , katz & lake 1996 ; @xcite , hereafter kgkk ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of sufficient resolution leads to artificial disruption of halos in clusters .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a strong artificial anti - bias ( especially at small scales @xmath33 , but larger scales are also affected ) .",
    "there are several ways to deal with this problem .",
    "one possible way is to break up massive structureless halos into subhalos using some kind of observationally motivated prescription (  @xcite ; klypin , nolthenius , & primack 1997 ) .",
    "these subhalos can then be included into halo catalogs used to compute the correlation function and other halo statistics .",
    "another common approach is to overcome overmerging by weighting the massive halos according to their mass and compute thus a _ weighted _ correlation function ( @xcite ) .",
    "both of these approaches are useful . nevertheless , it is not clear whether the unavoidable heuristic assumptions take the processes driving the small - scale bias evolution correctly into account .",
    "the weighting technique , for example , ignores the real physical effects in groups and clusters such as tidal stripping and dynamical friction .",
    "we will argue below that these effects are likely to be driving the small - scale bias evolution at low ( @xmath34 ) redshifts .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations that include gas cooling are affected by overmerging to a significantly lesser degree ( e.g. , summers et al .",
    "1995 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cooling creates compact dense objects inside halos which can survive in clusters .",
    "these simulations , therefore , can be used to study the halo clustering directly .",
    "unfortunately , the computational cost required to simulate a large volume with sufficiently high mass resolution is prohibitively high .",
    "moreover , such simulations usually oversimplify the gas dynamic by including only cooling mechanism .",
    "this leads to `` overcooling '' : without a heating process to regulate it , the cooling produces very compact and dense baryonic blobs in the halo centers .",
    "these blobs do survive successfully in clusters , but they also suffer much less from the tidal stripping of material as compared to a realistic galaxy with a more extended distribution of baryons",
    ". the mass of the objects may thus be higher than it should be which may lead to excessive dynamical friction and thus incorrect dynamics of halos .",
    "the very high resolution @xmath0-body simulations are thus a viable alternative , if the required resolution can be reached at an affordable computational cost . analytical arguments and numerical experiments ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ; kgkk ) indicate that the required force and mass resolution are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "this force resolution is sufficiently high for most halos to survive in high - density regions .",
    "the mass resolution is determined by the requirement that a galaxy - size halo should have @xmath37 particles to avoid relaxation effects and to assure a robust identification by a halo finding algorithm .",
    "the numerical simulations that reach such resolution ( ghigna et al . 1998 ; kgkk ) show that most halos do survive even in the richest clusters . the dynamic range required to reach",
    "the needed resolution in a statistically large volume , @xmath38 , is quite high : @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , the advances in computer hardware and in the numerical algorithms make it now possible to carry out such simulations at an affordable computational cost . in this paper",
    "we use such high dynamic range simulations to calculate the 2-point correlation function of halos and corresponding bias using _ all _ halos in the simulated volume : i.e. , both isolated dark matter halos and satellites of massive halos , and halos inside group- and cluster - size systems .",
    "the simulations of different cosmological models and box sizes were made using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ; kravtsov , klypin & khokhlov 1997 ) and the ap@xmath40 m ( couchman 1991 ) @xmath0-body codes .",
    "the absence of the overmerging ) of clusters are affected by the overmerging , even with resolution this high , is still a matter of debate .",
    "ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , for example , argue that these regions are still completely overmerged .",
    "they find , however , that halos survive at smaller radii ( @xmath41 kpc ) in their @xmath42 kpc resolution run1 , as compared to the @xmath43 kpc run2 .",
    "the resolution of the simulations presented in this paper is comparable to the run1 .",
    "we do find halos within central @xmath44 ( see   4.3 and figs .",
    "although some halos do survive at @xmath45 from cluster center , our tests show that these regions may be affected by the overmerging .",
    "the larger scales @xmath46 , are not affected ] in these simulations means that the additional steps such as breaking - up of clusters , or mass - weighting ( see above ) are not necessary .",
    "therefore , the correlation function of halos is measured _ directly _ down to unprecedentedly small scales ( @xmath47 ) without the usual uncertainties associated with these steps . for the first time this opens the possibility to study the effects of dynamical processes such as tidal destruction and dynamical friction on the evolution of small - scale bias .",
    "the results on the evolution of bias and on the halo correlation function can be used as a basis for comparisons and interpretations of the existing and upcoming observations , as well as a check and/or input for the analytic models of clustering evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly review the definitions of bias and current analytical models of its evolution .",
    "the cosmological models studied in this paper are described in   3 .",
    "the details of the numerical simulations and discussion of the construction of halo catalogs and halo survival in the high - density regions is given in ",
    "4 . in   5",
    "we present our results on the evolution of halo clustering and bias in different cosmological models .",
    "we also present a comparison of our @xmath12 results with the galaxy correlation function measured using the apm galaxy survey .",
    "a discussion of the main results is presented in   6 .",
    "we summarize our main results and conclusions in   7 .",
    "the notion of bias is more complicated than eq . ( 1 ) might suggest .",
    "formally , the bias is defined as a function relating fluctuations in the dark matter density , @xmath48 , to the fluctuations in the number density of objects , @xmath49 . in general , this relationship can be complicated and may depend on a large number of factors : scale , mass and/or type of objects , time , etc .",
    "the large number of the dependencies or discreteness of the object distribution can result in the _ stochasticity _ of the bias ( dekel & lahav 1998 ) : a scatter in the relationship between @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the bias can be _ non - local _ , if probability to form an object at a given point is not fully determined by local factors .",
    "for example , in addition to the local density , temperature , etc . , the probability to form a galaxy may depend on environment .",
    "analytical results of catelan et al .",
    "( 1998b ) indicate that the bias is expected to be non - local even in the linear regime .",
    "the lack of general understanding of these dependencies of the bias usually results in the use of the simplest assumptions .",
    "the most common approach is to assume that bias is _ local _ , depends only on the local matter density , and is _ linear _ : @xmath50 .",
    "an obvious consequence of the latter assumption is that bias is scale - independent . in this case , the correlation function and power spectrum of halos and dm are simply related by a constant scaling factor . although the linearity of bias would greatly simplify the theoretical interpretation of the clustering data , it is likely that bias depends on a variety of processes that may lead to nonlinearity .",
    "these processes include merging , tidal disruption ( e.g. , dubinski 1998 ) , suppression of galaxy formation in small halos due to supernovae feedback ( dekel & silk 1986 ; yepes et al .",
    "1997 ) , etc . the observations , in fact ,",
    "indicate that at small scales galactic bias _ is _ nonlinear .",
    "the correlation functions of different types of galaxies differ in amplitude and shape suggesting that at least some of the galaxies are nonlinearly biased .    during the last years",
    ", a significant progress has been made in the analytical modelling of the bias and its evolution ( e.g. , coles 1993 ; fry 1996 ; mo & white 1996 , hereafter mw ; matarrese et al .",
    "1997 ; mann et al . 1997 ; catelan et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "although the current analytical models may have some drawbacks and limitations , they provide an insight and interpretation for numerical simulations . at this point",
    "it is also important to check how well the prediction of the analytical models agree with the results of simulations ( see , e.g. , mw ; mo , jing & white 1996 ; jing 1998 ) .",
    "we will therefore review briefly some results of the analytical models concerning evolution of the bias .    in a seminal paper , kaiser ( 1984 )",
    "showed that if the observed systems in the universe ( such as galaxies and galaxy clusters ) form in the _ peaks _ of the density field , their distribution is biased .",
    "this is an example of _ statistical _ bias : the bias determined simply by the fact that objects do not sample the distribution of matter but that of the peaks , the latter having a statistically different distribution from the former .",
    "thus , the bias is introduced from the start by the way the objects form . however , the bias changes subsequently as the distribution evolves driven by the gravitation . in hierarchical models",
    "this evolution results in growth of objects via multiple mergers .",
    "however , if the merger rate is low , the evolution of bias can be modeled by the _ object - conserving model_. in this model the objects form with an initial statistical bias and after that are dragged without merging by a gravitational pull from the surrounding density fluctuations ( dekel & rees 1987 ; nusser & davis 1994 ; fry 1996 ) .",
    "mw used the extended press - schechter formalism to derive an expression for the bias in lagrangian coordinates ( comoving radius @xmath51 of the region from which halos form or halo mass @xmath22 ) . at linear scales , this expression or @xmath52 , as long as the scale @xmath21 is larger than the lagrangian radius @xmath51 .",
    "they find that at these scales the correlation function of halos and the bias in their numerical simulations are well described by equation ( 2 ) ( see , however , catelan et al .",
    "1998a , and jing 1998 ) . ] for the bias at redshift @xmath16 for dm halos of mass @xmath22 formed at redshift @xmath53 is ( matarrese et al . 1997 ) : @xmath54 here @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the growing mode of linear perturbations normalized to unity at @xmath12 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the critical overdensity for spherical collapse at @xmath12 , and @xmath59 is the rms linear mass fluctuation on the scale @xmath22 of halos linearly extrapolated to redshift @xmath16 .",
    "this expression is similar to that obtained in earlier studies from a peak - background split argument ( e.g. , cole & kaiser 1989 ) .",
    "the standard interpretation of the press - schechter description of the hierarchical evolution is that at any epoch @xmath16 all halos merge immediately to form more massive halos .",
    "thus , if observed objects are identified with host halos at any epoch , then @xmath60 in eq .",
    "matarrese et al .",
    "( 1997 ) call this _ the merging model_. the object - conserving and merging models are two extremes pictures of clustering evolution , although they may be applicable to the evolution of galaxy clustering at certain epochs . at some epochs the halos may neither survive nor merge instantly . moreover , other processes such as halo dynamics in galaxy clusters and groups may become important when clustering reaches highly nonlinear stages . the wealth of potentially important processes may make a one - to - one identification between galaxies and dm halos very difficult ( see , for example , discussion in moscardini et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "( 2 ) gives an estimate of the bias for objects of a single mass .",
    "the bias of a sample of objects ( `` effective '' bias ) with a range of masses @xmath61 should be calculated as a weighted _ average _ over the mass distribution of objects @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath62 is given by the press - schechter ( 1974 ) distribution and @xmath64 is the mean number density of objects with masses @xmath61 at redshift @xmath16 .",

    "this explains different values of @xmath147 for different models in table 2 .",

    "should be @xmath148 ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ; kgkk ) .",
    "furthermore , if we aim to study galaxy - size halos , the mass resolution should be @xmath36 to resolve galaxy - size halos ( @xmath149 ) with at least @xmath150 particles .",
    "the compromise between these considerations and the computational expense determined the force and mass resolution of our simulations ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the art code integrates the equations of motion in _ comoving _ coordinates .",
    "however , the refinement strategy of the art code is designed to effectively preserve the initial _ physical _ resolution of the simulation ( see below ) .",
    "the peak resolution is reached by creating a refinement hierarchy with six levels of refinement . in the 3 m",
    "runs the force resolution @xmath151 ( spline softening length ) was kept constant in comoving coordinates while fluctuations are still in the linear regime and is then set to be constant in _ physical _ units .",
    "the switch occurs at the moment when first galaxy - size halos start to collapse ( @xmath152 ) for our simulations .",
    "we chose to maintain fixed comoving resolution until it reaches @xmath153 ( physical ) ( at @xmath154 ) . at later moments",
    "the resolution is fixed to this value in physical coordinates ( the exception is the ocdm model in which the resolution was set to @xmath155 by mistake ) .",
    "the dynamical range @xmath156 of the simulations implied by the force resolution is @xmath157 ( @xmath158 formal ) for the art runs and @xmath159 for the 3 m runs . the dynamic range of the 3 m runs is just enough to keep the initial physical resolution ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the art code integrates the evolution in comoving coordinates .",
    "therefore , in order to prevent degradation of force resolution in _ physical _ coordinates , the dynamic range between the start and the end ( @xmath12 ) of the simulation should increase by @xmath161 : i.e. , for our simulations reach @xmath162 .",
    "this is accomplished with the prompt successive refinements during the simulations .",
    "the time stepping of the 3 m and art codes is rather different .",
    "first of all , the codes integrate the equation of motion using different time variables : the time in the 3 m code and the expansion factor in the art code .",
    "in the 3 m runs the time step is _ constant _ and is _ the same _ for all particles . in the art runs , as was noted above , the particles residing on different refinement levels move with different time steps .",

    "these algorithms are not designed to search for substructure ; they identify an isolated halo above virial overdensity as a single object and can not account for the internal substructure .",
    "our goal , however , is to identify both isolated halos and halos orbiting within larger systems ( `` sub - halos '' ) .",
    "the problems associated with halo identification within high - density regions are discussed in kgkk . in this study",
    "we use a halo finding algorithm called bound density maxima ( bdm ; see kgkk ) . a detailed description of the working version of the bdm algorithm used here can be found in klypin & holtzman ( 1997 ) .",
    "other recently developed algorithms capable of identifying satellite halos are described in ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kgkk .",
    "the main idea of the bdm algorithm is to find positions of local maxima in the density field smoothed at a certain scale and to apply physically motivated criteria to test whether the identified site corresponds to a gravitationally bound halo . in the following we describe specific parameters of the bdm used to construct halo catalogs used in our study ( the main parameters are listed in table 3 ) .",
    "the radius of a halo assigned to it by the algorithm is either its virial radius is set in accord with the prediction of the top - hat collapse model .",
    "note that @xmath177 depends on the cosmological model ( e.g. , kitayama & suto 1996 ) . ] or @xmath178 , whichever is smaller .",
    "the latter is approximately the maximum virial radius we would expect for a galaxy - size halo .",
    "the mass and radius are very poorly defined for the satellite halos due to the tidal stripping which alters a halo s mass and physical extent .",
    "therefore , in this study we will use maximum circular velocity @xmath179 as a proxy for halo mass .",
    "this allows us to avoid complications related to the mass and radius determination for satellite halos . for isolated halos @xmath179 and the halo s virial mass are directly related .",
    "for example , for a halo with a density distribution described by the navarro , frenk & white ( hereafter nfw ; 1996 ) profile @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ; @xmath182 is scale - radius ) : @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are virial mass and radius , @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",

    "the limiting radius of @xmath178 is sufficient to determine the @xmath179 for galaxy - size halos .",
    "the cluster - size halos are not explicitly excluded from the halo catalogs .",
    "we assume therefore that the center of each cluster can be associated with a central cluster galaxy . the latter ( due to the lack of hydrodynamics and other relevant processes )",
    "can not be identified in our simulations in any other way .",
    "the density maxima are identified using a top - hat filter with radius @xmath188 ( `` search radius '' ) .",
    "the search is performed starting from a large number of randomly placed positions ( `` seeds '' ) and proceeds by moving the center of mass within a sphere of radius @xmath188 iteratively until convergence . in order to make sure that we use a sufficiently large number of seeds",
    ", we used the position of every tenth particle as a seed .",
    "therefore , the number of seeds by far exceeds the number of expected halos .",
    "the search radius @xmath188 also defines the minimum allowed distance between two halos . if the distance between centers of any of the two halos is @xmath189 , only one halo ( the more massive of the two ) is left in the catalog .",
    "a typical value for the search radius is @xmath190 .",
    "we set a lower limit for the mass inside the search radius @xmath191 : halos with @xmath192 are not included in the catalog .",
    "this is done to exclude pure poisson fluctuations from the list of halo candidates .",
    "some halos may have significant substructure in their cores due , for example , to an incomplete merger .",
    "such cases appear in the catalogs as multiple ( 2 - 3 ) halos with very similar properties ( mass , velocity , radius ) at small separations .",
    "our strategy is to count these as a single halo .",
    "specific criteria used to identify such cases are : ( 1 ) distance between halo centers is @xmath193 , ( 2 ) their relative velocity in units of the rms velocity of particles in the halos @xmath194 is less than 0.15 , and ( 3 ) the difference in mass is less than factor 1.5 .",
    "only the most massive halo is kept in the catalog .",
    "it is obvious that for a statistical study it is important to be confident that our bdm algorithm does not miss a large fraction of halos . while a substantial effort is made to reject fake halos , it is important to make sure that all real halos are included in the catalog .",
    "the algorithm is very efficient at finding isolated halos and the major difficulties are in identification of halos in crowded regions .",
    "halo identification in such regions is complicated by the large number of halos and by the high - density background of fast moving particles .",

    "is described by the nfw formula .",
    "the halo is then placed on an orbit in a constant potential corresponding to a galaxy cluster of mass @xmath203with the nfw density distribution . the particular numbers quoted here are intended to mimic the orbital evolution in the cluster presented in figs",
    "the orbital evolution of the halo was studied for different orbits and different ( mass and force ) resolutions .",
    "both the mass and the force resolution were varied by more than a factor of ten .",
    "the orbital evolution of mass bound to the halo converges at the force resolution of the 3 m , the corresponding resolution is @xmath204 for the art . ]",
    "@xmath205 : i.e. , the evolution of bound mass in runs with higher resolution is _",
    "identical_. in fact , during the first @xmath206 gyrs the resolution of @xmath207 is adequate .",
    "the mass loss in this case is somewhat higher which leads to total destruction after 5 gyrs , whereas resolution of @xmath208 allows halo to survive during the hubble time .",
    "these experiments have also shown that mass resolution of @xmath209 is sufficient , provided that force resolution is high .",
    "two runs with force resolution of @xmath208 and with mass resolutions of @xmath210 and @xmath211 resulted in identical mass evolution .",
    "it is worth noting that in these experiments the halo was followed until it was totally destroyed by the tidal field ( @xmath212 gyrs in most cases ) . in real simulations , however , clusters form only at @xmath13 , and most of the accreted halos spend @xmath213 gyrs in clusters . during this",
    "time halos lose 80 - 90% ( depending on the orbit ) of their initial mass .",
    "thus , if the mass resolution is @xmath209 , the halos with initial mass @xmath214 can be identified even after spending a substantial time in a cluster .    details of the evolution of halos in clusters depend sensitively on the parameters of the halo orbit .",
    "specifically , the mass loss rate depends on the pericenter and on the eccentricity of the orbit . a halo on a very eccentric orbit survives for a considerably longer time than a halo on a circular orbit , even if the radius of the latter is larger than the pericenter .",
    "for example , a halo on a circular orbit with a radius of @xmath215 was _ totally destroyed _ in less than 5 gyrs , while a halo on a very eccentric orbit with the pericenter of only @xmath216 _ survived _ for more than 10 gyrs .",
    "the explanation for this is simple : a halo on a circular orbit spends all of its time in a high - density cluster core suffering a steady mass loss , while a halo on the eccentric orbit spends only a small fraction of its orbital period in the core .    with the resolution quoted above",
    ", only a relatively small fraction of halos can be tidally destroyed in clusters . only the halos with the _ apocenter _",
    "@xmath217 are subject to the destruction .",
    "it can be expected that halos which are accreted when the cluster was young and its radius was small ( @xmath218 ) have small apocenters .",
    "the fraction of such halos in a @xmath12 cluster is small .",
    "our estimates show that for halos with large apocenters the dynamical friction can not bring the apocenter considerably closer to the cluster center .",
    "the tidal stripping reduces the halo mass very efficiently , thus increasing the friction time .",
    "the tidal stripping that halos suffer in clusters has an important effect on their density profiles .",
    "it appears that the halo profile is affected at all radii and not only at radii close to the tidal radius .",
    "indeed , the trajectories of particles in a halo are mostly eccentric and after a crossing time the absence of the stripped particles will be `` felt '' by the whole halo .",
    "the change in the density profile means , of course , a change in the maximum circular velocity of the halo .",
    "the effect is not dramatic because the fraction of particles on highly eccentric orbits is rather small and the central regions of halos are thus affected the least .",
    "typically , the circular velocity of the halos is reduced during their evolution in the cluster by 20%30% .",
    "this correction was taken into account in figure 3 by reducing the velocity cut from 120 km / sec at z=1.0 to 100 km / sec at z=0.0 .",
    "the tidal destruction is important only for cluster - size halos ( where tidal fields are the strongest ) .",
    "there are three massive clusters in our simulation with mass @xmath219 .",
    "there is one `` coma cluster '' with velocity dispersion @xmath220 and mass @xmath221 inside @xmath222 radius .",
    "the cluster contains 201 halos of mass @xmath223 inside a 2  box and 9 halos inside 0.3 .",
    "unfortunately , the cluster has suffered a recent major merger and it was difficult to study the radial distribution of halos .",
    "one of the other two clusters also shows an indication of an ongoing merger .",

    "the mean number density of halos , @xmath232 , was estimated using all halos in the simulation within the above velocity limits ( @xmath233 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "the profile at @xmath227 is also rescaled into proper units .",
    "figure 3 clearly indicates that the number of halos in the central @xmath234 ( proper radius ) has declined substantially from @xmath227 to the present epoch . in the central @xmath234",
    "there are three times as many halos ( 24 ) at @xmath235 than at @xmath12 .",
    "if we interpret the difference as due to tidal destruction , then 16 halos were destroyed in the central part .",

    "this means that _ the scale - dependent bias is universal in cosmological models_. details of the evolution are , however , model dependent .",
    "the most drastic differences are seen at the highest redshifts .",
    "the figures , for example , clearly show that the bias at @xmath333 has very different values in different models . while bias in the two low-   models is very similar , the distribution of halos at this redshift is only weakly biased in the scdm model , as opposed to the strongly biased distribution in the  model . the evolution of the halo correlation function at three different comoving scales ( @xmath334 , 1 , and @xmath335 ) for all models is plotted in figure 13 .",
    "the solid lines in both panels represent results for the  model with the art code in the @xmath141 box . in the upper panel ,",
    "the evolution is shown for the halo catalogs with a fixed number density of halos , which was achieved by varying the @xmath179 limit in different models .",
    "note that in this case we compare correlations of halo samples with different mass functions : the  and ocdm halo samples contain many low - mass halos , while samples in the @xmath336 models contain only massive halos .",
    "such comparison is interesting for comparisons with observations when we know the number density of objects in the sample rather than their mass ( or type ) . at scales",
    "@xmath337 , differences between the models are not significant . at 3  and at high @xmath16",
    "the amplitude of  in the scdm model is significantly lower than in other models .",
    "the amplitude in the rest of the models is surprisingly similar .",
    "therefore , if the biased galaxy formation scenario is correct and galaxies can be associated with host halos , this result may have interesting implications for the interpretation of clustering observations . to be able to differentiate between the models , we _ must _ know what type of the objects was used to estimate the clustering signal .",
    "the knowledge of the number density of objects in the sample is not sufficient .",
    "the point is to some extent illustrated by the lower panel of figure 13 , where we compare the evolution of the  amplitude in @xmath275 , scdm , and  models for the halo catalogs with the same selection criterion ( @xmath338 ) .",
    "it is obvious that in this case the differences between the models are significant . although the differences are smaller at low redshifts , at @xmath339 the difference in the amplitude between  and scdm models is almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this difference can probably be explained by the delayed formation of galaxy - size halos in the  model as compared with the scdm model .",
    "the halos in the  form at lower redshifts with high _ statistical bias _ , while halos in the scdm form systematically earlier and thus have had time to go through merging evolution .",
    "the effect of the latter is to decrease the bias ( e.g. , moscardini et al .",
    "note also that merging rates are higher in @xmath340 models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these results show that predictions of cosmological models are very different for samples of objects selected with the same set of criteria for all models .",
    "the evolution of bias at scales @xmath334 and @xmath341 is shown in figure 14 for all models . here",
    "again we compute the halo correlation function for the fixed number density of halos .",
    "evolution of bias in all models is qualitatively similar to that of the  model discussed above : the bias is a very strong function of redshift .",
    "however , unlike the  amplitude , the value of bias at these scales is very different among the models .",
    "this is not very surprising because when the number density of halos is fixed , different models have very similar amplitudes of  ( see fig.13 ) , but very different amplitudes of .",
    "the latter is explained by the differences in the cosmological parameters , normalization , and the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "a more interesting implication of the figure 14 is that differences in bias get smaller at low redshifts , virtually disappearing at @xmath12 .",
    "the same effect can be observed in the evolution of the amplitude in figure 13 . as we will argue in the next section ,",
    "the evolution of the halo correlations and bias at these scales is likely to be driven by the halo dynamics within nonlinear structures , in which case the differences between different cosmologies are largely erased .",
    "the evolution shown in figures 13 and 14 provides , therefore , indirect support for this point : the differences in clustering amplitude and bias between the models disappear at @xmath13 , where most of the clustering signal comes from the halos located in nonlinear structures .",
    "it is interesting to compare the evolution of the halo correlation function and the bias observed in our simulations with predictions of the analytical models and results of previous numerical simulations .",
    "the fact that clustering strength of halos at high redshifts is comparable to that at the present epoch , has been noted in results of many simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; brainerd & villumsen 1994 ; coln et al .",
    "1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "bagla ( 1998 ) summarizes the generic behaviour of the correlation amplitude of halos above certain mass : the amplitude is high at very high redshifts , when halos are being formed , decreases thereafter and reaches a minimum , and then increases slowly and steadily until the present epoch .",
    "the results presented in the previous section ( see figs . 6 and 13 )",
    "are in agreement with this picture .",
    "thus , there seems to be a good qualitative ( although , in some cases , not quantitative ) agreement among results of different numerical simulations concerning the evolution of the halo correlation function .",
    "analytical models have reached a sufficient degree of sophistication to be able to predict the evolution of halo clustering in mildly nonlinear regimes ( see   2 ) .",
    "the halos are found to form at the peaks of the density field ( e.g. , @xcite ) and their bias exhibits a simple scaling relation with the height of these peaks ( kaiser 1984 ; @xcite ) . at any given epoch",
    "the halo population represents a mix of halos formed at different redshifts : newly - born or already evolved through merging .",
    "the evolution of the correlation of halos in such a hierarchical framework is described using the extended press - schechter formalism ( mw ) . to compare predictions of the analytical models with our results",
    ", we will use the approximation to the evolution of the _ effective bias _ given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( moscardini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this approximation describes the evolution of bias of a sample of all halos above a certain mass .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to our definition of halo samples with a limiting maximum circular velocity .",
    "the prediction of this approximation is shown in figure 8 with the dotted line , where we used @xmath342 and @xmath343 ( see eq.[4 ] ) appropriate for our model and for the mass limit of @xmath344 ( moscardini et al .",
    "the analytical model is expected to provide a good approximation at scales where @xmath345 ( mo et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e. at @xmath346 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "therefore , the analytical prediction should be compared with the curve showing evolution of bias at @xmath347 .",
    "the comparison shows that both the numerical result and the analytical model predict a rapid decrease of bias with cosmic time .",
    "moreover , at high redshifts ( @xmath305 ) they agree well _ quantitatively_. at lower redshifts , however , the two predictions deviate from each other and are different by a factor of 2 at @xmath12 : at @xmath347 almost no bias is observed in the simulation , while strong anti - bias of @xmath348 is predicted by the analytical model .",
    "the differences are not surprising , given the differences in our definition of a halo from that of the press - schechter halo .",
    "the definition of the latter does not include `` satellite '' halos ; a halo ceases to exist , once it becomes bound to another halo ( i.e. , _ `` merges '' _ ) and orbits inside that halo s virial radius . our definition , on the other hand ,",
    "does take satellite halos into consideration , because we include in our halo list every gravitationally bound clump of particles , regardless of whether it is also bound to a larger system or not .",
    "the similarity between our numerical result and the prediction of the analytical model at @xmath305 is then an indication that the two definitions are equivalent at these high redshifts . indeed , large systems such as clusters and groups have not yet formed at these redshifts , and the fraction of satellite halos in our catalogs ( i.e. , all halos above a certain mass limit ) is relatively small . at smaller redshifts",
    "the ever larger fraction of halos become satellites to more massive halos and the two halo definitions result in rather different halo samples .",
    "this explains the large difference predicted for the value of bias at @xmath12 .",
    "we have found that in our simulation the @xmath12 amplitude of the 2-point correlation function of the press - schecter halos ( i.e. , _ isolated _ in terms of their virial radius ) at @xmath347 is approximately _ two times as small _ as the amplitude of the correlation function of the bdm halos shown in fig .",
    "7 , resulting thus in the _ twice as small bias _ of @xmath349 . in this respect",
    ", we believe that there is no contradiction between our results and predictions of the analytical model , once the difference in the halo definition is taken into account .",
    "this also explains the difference in the bias value with the result of jing ( 1998 ) , who found bias of @xmath350 for the galaxy - size halos defined with the fof algorithm .",
    "we find also that , contrary to the assumption of the analytical models , the _ small - scale _ bias of the halo distribution is _ scale - dependent _ regardless of the halo definition .",
    "the large - scale bias ( @xmath351 ) , on the other hand , is not probed in our simulations and may be independent of scale , in accord with assumptions of the analytical models .",
    "this indeed was suggested by the simulations of jing ( 1998 ) .",
    "we think that the most encouraging result is the agreement between numerical and analytical modeling on the general form of the bias evolution demonstrated in fig .",
    "this indicates that we now have a solid general understanding of the nature of bias and of the processes driving its evolution at redshifts @xmath352 .    at smaller redshifts ,",
    "the merging rate is considerably smaller and small - scale correlations are sensitive to the dynamics of halos inside the nonlinear structures .",
    "particularly , the dynamics and the clustering evolution of satellite halos in high - density regions are essentially independent of the background cosmology and are driven by such processes as dynamical friction and tidal stripping ( e.g. , kgkk ) .",
    "these processes tend to suppress the growth of the correlation amplitude , thus counteracting the clustering growth due to the gravitational pull .",
    "this leads to the anti - bias observed in our simulations at nonlinear scales and at small redshifts .",
    "indeed , the correlation amplitude at small scales ( @xmath353 ) is approximately constant at redshifts @xmath354 ( see figs . 6 and 13 ) .",
    "moreover , anti - bias is observed in all cosmological models studied in this paper ( see figs .",
    "the fact that differences in the correlation amplitude and bias , existing between the cosmological models at @xmath24 , virtually vanish by the present epoch ( see figs",
    ". 13 and 14 ) argues for the importance of the nonlinear halo dynamics .",
    "this result also implies that low - redshift clustering depends only weakly on the background cosmology .",
    "therefore , the information about the underlying cosmological model can probably be extracted only from the high-@xmath16 ( @xmath305 ) clustering data . as was discussed in   4.3 ,",
    "the numerical resolution required to assure the survival of halos in high - density regions is high , and has not been reached in previous simulations .",
    "our results therefore indicate that high resolution is important for correct modelling of the bias evolution at small redshifts .",
    "although our definition of a halo is different from that used in the conventional press - schechter framework , we believe that it is closer to what can be identified in a simulation as a galaxy location .",
    "it seems likely that in _ every _ sufficiently massive ( @xmath31 ) _ gravitationally bound _",
    "halo baryons will cool , form stars , and produce an object ressembling a galaxy ( e.g. , kauffman , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; roukema et al .",
    "1997 ; yepes et al . 1997 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we believe , therefore , that each of the halos in our catalog can be associated with a `` galaxy '' .",
    "observationally , many distinct galaxies are located well inside the virial radii of massive galaxies , groups , and clusters .",
    "these galaxies , non - existent by definition in the `` virial overdensity '' halo catalogs , are included in galaxy surveys and are used to compute the correlation function . our definition , therefore , is natural , if the goal is to compare the observations with predictions of the numerical simulations .",
    "although , as we discussed above (   4.3 ) , the resolution ( and , correspondingly , the computational costs ) required for galaxy - size halos to survive in the tidal fields of high - density regions is quite high , the subsequent comparison with the observations is straightforward and does not require ambiguous corrections for the `` overmerging '' .    in  5.2",
    "we have compared the correlation function of halos @xmath5 in our @xmath141 simulation with the @xmath12 correlation function of galaxies @xmath30 ( baugh 1996 ) in the apm catalog ( loveday et al .",
    "1995 ) and found a very good agreement between the two .",
    "the apm galaxy correlation function is measured very accurately , which makes the agreement within the @xmath238-errorbars very striking ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "recently , the advent of new faint galaxy surveys allowed the measurement of the clustering surveys at redshifts of @xmath354 ( e.g. , le fvre et al .",
    "1996 ; shepherd et al .",
    "1997 ; carlberg et al . 1997 ; connolly et al .",
    "1998 ; postman et al . 1998 ; carlberg et al .",
    "unfortunately , there is some disagreement between these studies concerning the amplitude of the clustering signal , which possibly indicates that there is morphology and/or luminosity segregation in the clustering of the intermediate redshift galaxies .",
    "it is indeed true that the correlation amplitude depends on the luminosity of the galaxies ( e.g. , carlberg et al .",
    "1998 ; postman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the comoving correlation length @xmath296 measured in these surveys varies , generally lying in the range @xmath355 with an average value of about @xmath356 .",
    "the correlation length of bright galaxies is , however , somewhat larger and consistent with the correlation length of the local galaxies @xmath357 ( carlberg et al .",
    "1998 ; postman et al .",
    "comparison of the above values of @xmath296 with correlations in our  simulation ( table 4 ) , shows that we predict a correlation length in good agreement with that of bright galaxies and somewhat larger than the @xmath296 value of the faint galaxies .",
    "the latter , however , is measured with rather large uncertainties and our values of @xmath296 are actually consistent with the observed ones within @xmath238 .",
    "remarkable progress of the high - redshift galaxy detection techniques , based on the search for the signatures of the lyman break in the colors of faint galaxies ( steidel & hamilton 1992 , 1993 ) , resulted in a rapid growth of amount and quality of the clustering observations at @xmath24 ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ; adelberger et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these `` lyman break galaxies '' ( lbgs ) were found to be clustered at @xmath24 as strongly as the present day galaxies .",
    "the real - space correlation function of these galaxies was well - described by the conventional power - law form with the value of the slope @xmath297 and the correlation length @xmath296 consistent with the @xmath308 values ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath358 and @xmath356 .",
    "these values are in reasonably good agreement with @xmath74 values for our @xmath359 catalog ( table 4 ) .",
    "the value of bias that is measured for the lbgs at scales of @xmath360 is @xmath361 , for the @xmath340 , @xmath362 ( open ) , and @xmath363 ( flat ) models , respectively ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ; adelberger et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these values can be compared with @xmath364 for halos in our simulations , shown in figs .  8 and 14 .",
    "all models agree with the observations , within the uncertainties of the galaxy - to - halo mapping .",
    "this result is in general agreement with the results of the numerous recent numerical studies that modeled the clustering of lbgs ( e.g. , wechsler et al . 1998 ; jing & suto 1998 ; bagla 1998 ; governato et al .",
    "however , there appear to be some puzzling details in comparisons with the data .",
    "the observed value of @xmath365 can be reproduced in the for massive halos with @xmath366 ( see top panel of fig.8 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with almost all other theoretical studies .",
    "however , the correlation function of the lbgs measured by giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , does not agree with the correlation function measured for the @xmath366 of our halos : @xmath356 for lbgs versus @xmath367 for the halos .",
    "this disagreement was actually noticed in the study of adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who used the count - in - cells analysis to derive the value of bias .",
    "the values of the parameters of the correlation function that were derived from the observed rms fluctuations of galaxies in cells of @xmath368 ( @xmath369 ) , are considerably higher than those measured directly by giavalisco et al .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath370 in our simulation is @xmath371 for halos with @xmath372 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of the lbgs as objects residing inside massive ( @xmath366 or @xmath373 ) dm halos .",
    "this result supports the interpretation of adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and suggests that the correlation amplitude of the lbgs may be higher than that obtained from the observed angular correlation function ( giavalisco et al . 1998 ) .",
    "overall , we believe that the comparisons discussed above indicate that there is good agreement between our results and the clustering data at both low and high redshifts .",
    "this implies that hierarchical models in which observed galaxies form in the host dm halos naturally explain the observed galaxy clustering at different epochs , including excellent agreement with the accurately measured @xmath12 correlation function . on the other hand ,",
    "the generic form of the bias evolution observed in the numerical simulations at high redshifts agrees well with the prediction of the analytical models based on the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "this implies that we understand the nature of the bias and the processes that drive its evolution at high @xmath16 . at low redshifts ,",
    "the bias evolution of gravitationally bound halos is driven by the dynamical processes inside the nonlinear structures which are largely independent of cosmology .",
    "the study of these processes is important for a successful modelling of galaxy clustering at @xmath13 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the correlation function and bias of galaxy - size halos in different cosmological models ( , ocdm , , and scdm ) .",
    "the high - resolution of our numerical simulations allowed us to avoid the overmerging in the high - density regions and estimate the correlation amplitude and bias _ directly _ at small ( down to @xmath374 ) scales .",
    "the main results and conclusions presented in this paper are as follows .",
    "at all epochs , the 2-point correlation function of galaxy - size halos @xmath5 is well approximated by a power - law @xmath375 with the slope @xmath376 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath296 at @xmath12 is @xmath377 , regardless of the minimal mass limit of the halo samples . at high redshifts",
    ", the correlation function evolves non - monotonically : @xmath296 decreases somewhat between redshifts of 5 and 3 , and then increases steadily until @xmath12 . for the most massive halos ,",
    "the correlation length at @xmath315 is comparable to that at @xmath12 .",
    "the difference between the shape of the @xmath5 and the shape of the correlation function of matter results in a _ scale - dependent bias _ at scales @xmath7 .",
    "we find this to be a generic prediction of the hierarchical models independent of the epoch and of the model details .",
    "another generic prediction is that the _ comoving _ amplitude of the correlation function for halos above a certain mass evolves non - monotonically : it decreases from an initially high value at @xmath378 , and very slowly increases at @xmath13 .",
    "this behaviour at large scales was demonstrated by a number of authors ( see   6 ) . here",
    ", we have shown that this behaviour also applies to the correlation amplitude at small scales ( @xmath337 ) .",
    "the non - monotonic evolution of the correlation function calls into question the usefulness of the simplistic `` @xmath285-models '' as a description of the clustering evolution .",
    "we note , however , that at @xmath13 the evolution of the halo correlation function is approximately monotonic ( albeit dependent on scale ) .",
    "the very slow evolution of the halo correlation amplitude in _ comoving _ coordinates at these redshifts implies a value of @xmath287 , which is in agreement with the values preferred by the observations ( e.g. , postman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the evolution of the halo correlation function is _ very mild _ compared to evolution of the dark matter correlation function .",
    "the latter evolves by a factor of @xmath379 ( depending on scale ) between redshifts of @xmath380 and @xmath381 , while the difference in amplitude of the former between any two epochs is less than a factor of 2 .",
    "the large difference in the evolution rates of the matter and halo correlation functions means that the bias evolves rapidly with cosmic time : it changes from high @xmath382 values of @xmath8 at @xmath9 to _ anti - bias _",
    "@xmath382 values of @xmath313 on small @xmath11 scales at @xmath12 .",
    "we find that our results agree well with existing clustering data at different redshifts , indicating a general success of the hierarchical models of structure formation in which galaxies form inside the host dm halos .",
    "particularly , we find excellent agreement in both slope and amplitude between @xmath14 in our simulation and the galaxy correlation function measured using the apm galaxy survey . at high redshifts ,",
    "all models reproduce well the observed clustering of the lyman - break galaxies .",
    "our results imply that for high - redshift clustering to be used as a cosmological test , it is crucial that we know what type of objects are used to estimate the clustering signal .",
    "the knowledge of the number density of objects _ is not sufficient _ ( see   5 ) .",
    "we find good agreement at @xmath15 between our results and predictions of the analytical models of bias evolution ( mw ; matarrese et al .",
    "this indicates that we now have a solid understanding of the nature of the bias and of the processes that drive its evolution at these @xmath16 .",
    "we argue , however , that at lower redshifts the evolution of bias is driven by dynamical processes , i.e. , dynamical friction and tidal stripping , inside the nonlinear high - density regions such as galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "these processes do not depend on cosmology and tend to erase the differences in clustering properties of halos that exist between cosmological models at high @xmath16 .",
    "the latter result implies that low - redshift clustering is probably not a very strong discriminator between cosmological models .",
    "we believe that the success of the current theoretical models in interpreting the clustering data forms a solid foundation for further sophistication of the models by including the processes important for galaxy formation ( such as dynamics of baryons , cooling , star formation , and stellar feedback )",
    ". these models would allow one to predict the observed properties of galaxies and thus mimick the observational selection criteria , allowing for a robust comparison between the model and the data .",
    "we believe that the differences between high-@xmath16 clustering properties of objects in different cosmological models demonstrated in this study ( see   5 ) , the improved theoretical models , and the ever increasing amount of new clustering data can be successfully combined in the near future to put useful constraints on the cosmological parameters describing our universe .",

    "<S> we study the evolution of the halo - halo correlation function and bias in four cosmological models ( , ocdm , , and scdm ) using very high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations with dynamical range of @xmath1 ( force resolution of @xmath2 and particle mass of @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high force and mass resolution allows dark matter ( dm ) halos to survive in the tidal fields of high - density regions and thus prevents the ambiguities related with the `` overmerging problem . '' </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to estimate for the first time the evolution of the correlation function and bias at small ( down to @xmath4 ) scales .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that at all epochs the 2-point correlation function of galaxy - size halos @xmath5 is well approximated by a power - law with slope @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the shape of @xmath5 and the shape of the correlation function of matter results in the _ scale - dependent bias _ at scales @xmath7 , which we find to be a generic prediction of the hierarchical models , independent of the epoch and of the model details . </S>",
    "<S> the bias evolves rapidly from a high value of @xmath8 at @xmath9 to the _ anti - bias _ of @xmath10 at small @xmath11 scales at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> another generic prediction is that the _ comoving _ amplitude of the correlation function for halos above a certain mass evolves non - monotonically : it decreases from an initially high value at @xmath9 , and very slowly increases at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our results agree well with existing clustering data at different redshifts , indicating the general success of the hierarchical models of structure formation in which galaxies form inside the host dm halos . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we find an excellent agreement in both slope and the amplitude between @xmath14 in our simulation and the galaxy correlation function measured using the apm galaxy survey . at high redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> the observed clustering of the lyman - break galaxies is also well reproduced by the models . </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement at @xmath15 between our results and predictions of the analytical models of bias evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that we have a solid understanding of the nature of the bias and of the processes that drive its evolution at these epochs . </S>",
    "<S> we argue , however , that at lower redshifts the evolution of the bias is driven by dynamical processes inside the nonlinear high - density regions such as galaxy clusters and groups . </S>",
    "<S> these processes do not depend on cosmology and tend to erase the differences in clustering properties of halos that exist between cosmological models at high @xmath16 .    </S>",
