    "<S> the detection of strangelets has long been a main subject in the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments and the cosmic - ray space experiments concerning with the search for anomalously heavy nuclei @xcite , and unfortunately , by now , it has not been found yet .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a very interesting anomalous event has been announced by the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-01 ) collaboration @xcite . within more than four million he events collected by ams-01 detector , one that has @xmath1 of @xmath2 , kinetic energy of @xmath3 @xmath4 and corresponds to the flux of @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> was found . </S>",
    "<S> this was a doubly charged anomalous event and it strongly needed further explanation from theoretical view of point whether the event denoted a small lump of strange quark matter , i.e. strangelet , or only a nuclei @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper evolves from an attempt to give a possible explanation for this doubly charged and heavy mass event </S>",
    "<S> . we will employ the quark mass density - dependent ( qmdd ) model which was firstly suggested by fowler , raha and weiner @xcite and then used by many authors to study the stability and other properties of strange quark matter @xcite . in a series of our previous papers @xcite , based on the friedberg - lee model @xcite , we extended the qmdd model to a quark mass density- and temperature- dependent ( qmdtd ) model at finite temperature . the thermodynamical properties and the stability of strangelets @xcite , the dibaryon system @xcite and the photo strange star @xcite have been discussed by using qmdtd  model . at zero temperature , the qmdtd model reduces to the qmdd model . </S>",
    "<S> since the ams-01 experiment was flown on the space shuttle discovery during flight sts-91 ( 1998 ) in a 51.70 orbit at altitudes between 320 and 390 km , the temperature of cosmic space is very low and we will neglect the temperature effect in our calculation .    according to qmdd model @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the masses of @xmath6 quarks and strange quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the baryon number density , @xmath9 is the current mass of the strange quark and @xmath10 is the vacuum energy density . </S>",
    "<S> one can proved that the properties of strange matter in the qmdd  model are nearly the same as those obtained in the mit bag model @xcite .    at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the particle number @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) reads    @xmath13    and the total energy of the strangelet is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the chemical potential of the quark and @xmath16 is the density of states . for a spherical cavity , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 can be obtained by multi - reflection theory @xcite or by numerical calculation @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we limit our calculation in the area @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 quarks positive .    at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the stability of a strangelet is determined by its energy . </S>",
    "<S> since the strangeness number @xmath22 and the electric charge @xmath26 are conserved in the strong process , a general expression of a two - body strong decay for strangelet @xmath33 can be written as    @xmath34    with the energy balance of the corresponding reaction satisfies    @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for a baryon with strangeness number @xmath37 and electric charge @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> for the weak process , the electric charge @xmath26 is still conserved but @xmath39 , therefore , @xmath40 if the energy balance of the corresponding reaction satisfies @xmath41 a strangelet that decays via strong processes is called unstable strangelet and the one could withstand strong decay and only decays via weak processes is called metastable strangelet @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are shown in figure 1 , 2 and table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two parameters , namely , bag constant @xmath10 and current mass of strange quark @xmath9 in the qmdd model . </S>",
    "<S> we fix @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 first . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of strangelets with fixed electric charge @xmath47 and different baryon number @xmath24 and strangeness number @xmath22 is shown in figure 1 , where open circles stand for the unstable strangelets and filled circles stands for the metastable strangelets . </S>",
    "<S> the strangelet with the energy most close to that of the anomalous event in ams-01 detection ( @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 , which is a metastable strangelet and is represented by a filled square in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the strangelet @xmath52 is composed by @xmath53 strange quarks , @xmath54 up quarks and @xmath55 down quarks . in figure 2 , we draw the curve of its energy as the function of the radius . </S>",
    "<S> while the energy of the strangelet has its minimal value , the corresponding radius is called the stable radius of the strangelet , and the stable radius reads @xmath56 @xmath57 for @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the interested properties of the strangelet in the experimental detection is its mean lifetime @xmath58 . employing the decay formula given by chin and kerman@xcite @xmath59\\sin ^2\\theta _ </S>",
    "<S> cf(z ) ,   \\label{qing}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 where the cabibbo angle is given by @xmath61 , and considering relativistic factor @xmath62 @xcite , we obtain that the dynamical mean lifetime @xmath63 for @xmath52 is @xmath64 @xmath65 , which is long enough for experimental detection .    obviously , above result depends on the choice of parameters @xmath66and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the available choices of @xmath66and @xmath9 are limited in an area called  stability window  which is shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for qmdd  model . to confirm our result </S>",
    "<S> , we choose 4 different parameter pairs ( @xmath67 @xmath9 ) in this window and other two pairs ( @xmath68 @xmath46 @xmath44 @xmath69 @xmath43 ) , ( @xmath70 @xmath43 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath43 ) given by references @xcite to calculate , and results are shown in table 1    @xmath73    ( table 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we see from table 1 that we can always find a metastable strangelet that satisfies the condition @xmath1 @xmath74 , although their compositions , radiuses and dynamic mean lifetime are different . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we come to the conclusion that the doubly charged anomalous heavy event detected by ams-01 could attribute to a metastable strangelet , and this conclusion given by qmdd  model is not parameters dependent .    in summary , by means of the qmdd  model , we give a possible explanation for the doubly charged anomalous heavy event found by ams-01 detector . </S>",
    "<S> it seems a strangelet . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion dose not depend on the choices of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> of course , we need more events to confirm the existence of the strangelet and we hope ams-02 could provide us more information of this topic . </S>"
