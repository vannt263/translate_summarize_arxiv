    "spectral data cubes obtained at radio frequencies ( e.g. via aperture synthesis , mosiacs or multibeam instruments ) and optical / infrared wavelengths ( e.g. via integral field units , scanning fabrey - perot interferometers , or multi - object spectrographs ) comprise two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension . in both regimes ,",
    "the spectral dimension is a proxy for the relative line - of - sight velocity between the observer and source , resulting in spectral features that are doppler - shifted from their rest frequency .",
    "the challenge is to intuitively understand the relationship between the two spatial plus one velocity observations , and the true three - dimensional spatial plus three - dimensional velocity structure .",
    "solutions exist for simple velocity structures , such as rotating extragalactic hi disks , which can be fit by a set of inclined , differentially rotating annuli as a function of radius ( e.g. rogstad et al .",
    "1974 , begeman 1989 ) .",
    "these models , however , do not easily account for kinematic features such as warps , anomalous gas , or mergers , and are not appropriate for interpreting the complex velocity structures that occur in observations of galactic - plane neutral hydrogen .",
    "one option that presents itself is to generate particle models , where the full 3d spatial , @xmath0 , and 3d velocity , @xmath1 , information is known for each particle , and project this to spectral cube `` space '' , @xmath2 , for display .",
    "the orientation of the model data with respect to the world camera , with unit up vector , @xmath3 , view direction , @xmath4 , and right vector , @xmath5 , is used to obtain the coordinates for plotting points in spectral cube space : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the overall system velocity .",
    "it is straightforward to convert @xmath8 to a frequency or wavelength .",
    "the result of this process is demonstrated in figure [ o11.3-fig-1 ] for a galaxy merger .",
    "we are using the s2plot 3d - graphics library ( barnes et al .",
    "2006 ) to develop a framework where models can be examined interactively alongside their spectral - cube projections .",
    "this approach enables an increased intuitive understanding of complex kinematical structures . as a simple , yet powerful application development library ( c / c++/fortran ) , s2plot provides customizable user interaction via keyboard and mouse controls ; output to mono- and stereoscopic displays ; and support for publication in 3d - pdf format ( e.g. barnes & fluke 2008 ) via vrml - export with a single key press .",
    "simulation inputs and spectral cube data formats can be handled with custom code or standard c libraries ( e.g. cfitiso for fits files ) .",
    "figure [ o11.3-fig-2 ] shows a screenshot from a prototype application ",
    "screen elements are described in the caption , and image annotations identify the main s2plot functionality we use .",
    "we note our s2plot approach is limited by the workstation s graphics memory , and may not be suitable for very large spectral data cubes ( @xmath9 voxels ) . to this end",
    ", we anticipate integrating our approach with a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) based volume rendering system ( see hassan et al .",
    "alternatively , it may be sufficient to select sub - volumes to analyze .",
    "we intend to include support for the following basic functionality : generation of standard model components such as rotating disks , warps , hot - spots , expanding shells , @xmath10-body simulated data ; model - specific controls ( e.g. interactive rotation curves and density profiles for disk models ) ; realistic noise ; overlay of simulated spectral data on observational data ; and integrated quantitative analysis tools , such as 3d cartesian shapelet decomposition .",
    "the one- and two - dimensional cartesian shapelets formalism was introduced by refregier ( 2003 ) . in one dimension",
    ", shapelets form an orthonormal basis set : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shapelet order , @xmath13 , is the @xmath12-th hermite polynomial , and @xmath14 is a scale factor .",
    "we have recently extended the cartesian approach to 3d , deriving a number of important analytic relationships ( fluke et al . in prep ) . while a full presentation is beyond the scope of this paper , the orthonormality of shapelet states enables us to write 3d shapelets in terms of functions : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the integer shapelet orders .",
    "an arbitrary ( sufficiently well - behaved ) 3d structure , @xmath17 , can be decomposed into a weighted sum of shapelet coeffecients , @xmath18 , by integration over a volume , @xmath19 : @xmath20 subject to @xmath21 , and an `` optimal '' @xmath14-value .",
    "the shapelet reconstruction is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an optional filter term .",
    "an example of the decomposition and reconstruction process for a mock spectral data cube ( no noise ) is shown in figure [ o11.3-fig-3 ] . as a highly parallel task",
    ",    the decomposition and reconstruction processes can be efficiently implemented on a gpu ( barsdell et al .",
    "we are using the s2plot programming library to enable interactive , visualization - directed model - fitting of spectral data cubes , leading to improved intuitive understanding of complex kinematic structures .",
    "shapelet space provides new opportunities for quantitative analysis of complex 3d structures .",
    "we intend a public code release on completion .",
