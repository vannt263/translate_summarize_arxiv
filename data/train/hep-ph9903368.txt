    "ground state mesons such as the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , which are electrically neutral and contain a quark and antiquark of different flavor , can evolve into their respective antiparticles , the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "measurements of the rates of @xmath8 mixing and @xmath9 mixing have guided both the elucidation of the structure of the standard model , and the determination of the parameters that populate it .",
    "the mixing measurements permitted crude , but accurate , estimates of the masses of the then - hypothetical charm and top quark masses prior to direct observation of those quarks at the high energy frontier . since  mixing is expected to be small in the standard model it provides sensitivity to new heavy non - standard model particles .",
    "the mixing of @xmath10 can proceed either through real or virtual intermediate states .",
    "real intermediate states ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ... ) lead to lifetime differences between the  eigenstates (  mixing ) , while virtual intermediate states lead to a mass difference (  mixing ) .",
    "both of these amplitudes are ( at least ) doubly cabibbo suppressed compared to the total  decay amplitude . additionally , the near degeneracy of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quark masses compared to the @xmath16 mass , causes the glashow - illiopolouos - maini ( gim ) cancellation to be particularly effective  @xcite .",
    "this introduces an additional suppression to the mixing amplitudes of from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the ratio of the mixing amplitudes to the total decay amplitude is given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for virtual and real amplitudes respectively .",
    "the observation of a value of @xmath21 in the @xmath22 system in excess of about @xmath23 might be evidence of incomplete gim - type cancellations among new families of particles , such as supersymmetric partners of quarks.@xcite the evidence would be most compelling if either the mixing amplitude exhibited a large cp violation , or if the standard model contributions could be decisively determined .",
    "it is possible that in the standard model that @xmath24,@xcite and a determination of @xmath20 allows the estimation of at least some of the long - distance standard model contributions to @xmath19 .",
    "in the two - body hadronic decay , `` right sign '' events are produced by the cabibbo favored decay .",
    "`` wrong sign '' events , , are produced either through the doubly cabibbo suppressed tree diagram ( dcsd ) or through  mixing followed by the cabibbo allowed decay , . the decay time distribution of the  mesons allows us to separate the total wrong sign rate into its ,  and dcsd components . in the limit of small mixing and no cp violation",
    "the decay time distribution is given by  @xcite ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the strong phase between the  and   amplitudes and is small by theoretical bias .",
    "examples of the distribution for dcsd ,  mixing and  mixing are plotted in figure  [ fig : taudist ] .",

    "we reconstruct the decay chain ; .",
    "the charge of the soft pion from the  decay allows us to tag the flavor of the  at the moment of production . combining that with the charge of the kaon determines whether the event is right or wrong sign .    for right sign events , as shown in figure  [ fig : backgrounds]-a",
    ", we observe the mass distribution of the @xmath11 combinations ( ) to peak at the  mass .",
    "additionally , when we construct the quantity , which is @xmath31 , we see a peak at the mass difference .",
    "these events allow us to model the wrong sign signal shape since the right sign and wrong sign events have identical kinematics .",
    "the signal shape is gaussian in each of the two dimensions .",
    "the resolution on  is 6.5 mev and is dominated by momentum mismeasurements .",
    "it is shown for right sign events in figure  [ fig : resolutions]-a .",
    "the resolution on  is dominated by multiple scattering of the slow pion from the . using information from the silicon vertex detector we determine the decay point of the  by extrapolating from the reconstructed  spatial vertex back to the beam spot along the  momentum vector .",
    "we can then refit the soft pion momentum vector through this additional point which improves the measured  mass resolution from about 700 to 205 kev .",
    "the soft pion refit also reduces backgrounds since background soft pions are often inconsistent with production at the primary vertex .",
    "the combination of these two effects leads to an increase in signal squared over background of 4.7 , as shown in figure  [ fig : resolutions]-b .",
    "the main backgrounds to the analysis all have shapes that are distinct from signal in the  vs.  plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : backgrounds]b shows right sign events where the pion from the  decay is misidentified as a kaon and vice versa .",
    "this double misidentification leaves the  peak intact but smeares out the  peak .",
    "figure  [ fig : backgrounds]c shows background events composed of a properly reconstructed  decay plus a random slow track .",
    "they are indistinguishable from signal in , since they are real  decays .",
    "however , the events distribute themselves in  according to phase space and produce equal numbers of right and wrong sign events .",
    "lastly , there are ; @xmath32 decays .",
    "for instance , if a  decay is misreconstructed it can peak broadly around the  mass if the @xmath33 mass is neglected and one of the other pions is misidentified as a kaon . since the momentum vector of the actual and the misreconstructed",
    "are close , the  distribution is broadly peaked about the mass difference .",
    "we have performed a binned maximum likelihood fit of the mc - generated background components to the two dimensional data on the  vs.  plane , to obtain .",
    "the fit also yields a breakdown of the background event content in fig .",
    "[ fig : wssignal]a and  [ fig : wssignal]b .",
    "the proper time distribution of events within the signal region is shown in figure  [ fig : lifetimes ] for both right sign and wrong sign events .",
    "events with poorly measured proper times are excluded .",
    "the mean proper time of the right sign decays is @xmath35 which is consitent with a pure exponential decay with the  lifetime .",
    "the wrong sign events have a mean proper time of @xmath36 . according to the fit",
    ", the wrong sign events are composed of signal ( ) , real  decays ( ) and other backgrounds ( ) . if we assume that  decays have a lifetime of one and the other backgrounds have a lifetime of zero , which is a conservative assumption , then we determine the signal lifetime to be @xmath37 .",
    "care must be taken when using this measurement to determine a 90% confidence level upper limit since the physically allowed region of  ranges between one and three for all dcsd or all  mixing when @xmath38 .",
