    "what electric force ( if any ) acts on a pointlike charge at rest outside a wormhole , if there are no more charges in the space ?",
    "this question is of interest by , at least , two reasons .",
    "the first is its relation to the famous concept of  charge without charge \" @xcite .",
    "suppose , in a flat region of a spacetime we observe the electric field @xmath1 from this we need not conclude that the field is generated by a charge ( sitting , say , at @xmath2 ) .",
    "it may well happen that there is a wormhole mouth inside the sphere @xmath3 ( so that the  coordinate \" @xmath4 does not , in fact , take the zero value ) and the field force lines do not terminate at all , see figure  [ fig : kar1 ] .     of [ fig :",
    "the divergent gray lines are the force lines of a source - free field which  imitates \" the coulomb field for an observer outside the sphere @xmath6.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    which suggests that maybe there is no charge  as  substance \" | in nature and the electromagnetic field is described by the source - free maxwell equations , while all elementary  charges \" are , in fact , mouths of wormholes . in developing such a theory it would be important to know how strong the resemblance is between a wormhole threaded by force lines and a pointlike charge @xmath7 . the flux conservation together with the spherical symmetry guarantees that is valid in both cases .",
    "so , one might think that , as long as we restrict ourselves to the region @xmath8 , the resemblance is perfect .",
    "as we shall see , however , _ this is not the case _ : the force @xmath9 experienced by a finite charge @xmath0 put in a point @xmath10 outside the wormhole would _ not _ be just the coulomb force @xmath11 ( moreover , @xmath12 may turn out to be a negligible part of @xmath9 ) .",
    "another reason of interest in finding @xmath9 is the possible existence of macroscopic traversable wormholes . at the moment",
    "the only observational restriction on their abundance has been obtained on the basis of unusual lensing properties of negative mass @xcite and is valid only for a very special type of wormholes .",
    "to improve the situation it would be desirable , of course , to know more about physical effects involving wormholes .",
    "the consideration of the electrostatic problem in the wormhole background can be viewed as a step in that direction .",
    "an interesting , in this sense , result of this paper is that self - interaction leads to appearance of the attraction infinitely growing ( in the approximation of infinitely short throat ) as the charge approaches a mouth of a wormhole .",
    "tempted by the resemblance between the electrostatic and ( newton s ) gravitational forces | which differ in the _ sign _ , though | one might speculate therefore that wormholes are possible which are macroscopic and static , but nevertheless non - traversable for massive bodies .",
    "our analysis will be confined to a simplest wormhole : @xmath13 @xmath14{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\",

    "* problem 14.16 ) that in curved spacetime the maxwell equations written for the vector - potential @xmath22 have , in the general case , two non - equivalent versions .",
    "fortunately , @xmath23 for our metric and the difference does not lead to any ambiguity in the equation on @xmath24 .",
    "it reads : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the derivatives are by the coordinates of @xmath27 ( not @xmath10 ) .",
    "equation   can be solved by standard methods , see the following section , but there are two problems in finding the force @xmath9 from @xmath28 :    [ [ a. ] ] a. + +    the solutions of diverge in @xmath10 , where the force is to be found , and thus one needs a  renormalization \" procedure to derive a meaningful and finite value for the force .",
    "the problem is quite hard in the general case , see , e.  g. , @xcite , and references therein , but in the case under discussion @xmath10 is restricted to @xmath29 , where the procedure is trivial due to flatness : to obtain the renormalized solution @xmath30 one simply subtracts the coulomb part from @xmath28 , see @xcite .",
    "[ [ b. ] ] b. + +    the more serious problem is that has too many solutions : if some @xmath31 solves   then so also does @xmath32 where @xmath33 is arbitrary and the  source - free \" potential @xmath34 is an arbitrary harmonic function . in the ordinary electrostatics",
    "the problem is solved by requiring the electric field to fall at infinity @xmath35    [ eq : na pot - l ]    which physically means that we are not interested in field configurations with infinite energies .",
    "we adopt the restriction too , but in our case this does not fix the problem , because in @xmath5 there _ are _ non - zero harmonic functions satisfying  .",
    "thus , the ( absolute value of ) the force experienced by a pointlike charge near the wormhole is _ arbitrary _ and the question posed in the beginning of the paper has no meaningful answer . to overcome this problem",
    "i introduce  the charge \" of the wormhole defined | up to the factor @xmath36 | as the flux of @xmath37 through the throat and prove ( see the proposition in the following section ) that _ for the wormhole of a given charge @xmath7 the solution of is unique _ up to an additive constant .",
    "the solution depends on @xmath7 in quite a natural way : @xmath38 [ cf .  ] .",
    "the desired force acting on the charge is found now by , first , differentiating this expression by the coordinates of @xmath27 and then setting @xmath39 : @xmath40 ( as before , @xmath41 in this expression acts on the first argument ) .",
    "formally , equation solves the problem in discussion [ an explicit expression for @xmath42 is given by ] .",
    "it is , however , of little practical use yet .",
    "indeed , by @xmath43 one normally understands the dependence of the force on position of the charge when everything except the position is assumed to be fixed .",
    "but this latter ( perhaps , somewhat vague ) condition in no way enters the derivation of and the function @xmath44 is therefore _",
    "arbitrary_. to fix it suppose that the charge is transported ( quasistatically , so that the radiation can be neglected ) from @xmath10 to some other point @xmath45 . in section  [ sec : s - i",
    "] , i argue that @xmath7 in such a case will remain unchanged @xmath46 , which conservation justifies the name  charge \" .",
    "so , must be complemented with @xmath47 which accomplishes the task .",
    "[ complf ]    the structure of with @xmath7 independent of @xmath10 and @xmath48 independent of @xmath7 suggests interpretation of the first term in as the force exerted on the charge by the source - free field , or by the wormhole . and the second term is naturally interpreted as the self - force .

    "neither of those @xmath53 satisfies , but the main problem with finding the self - force [ which is how to identify the self - interaction potential among the infinitely many solutions of ] is the same as in our case .",
    "correspondingly , as explained above , the quantity @xmath54 need not be the self - force . and ,",
    "indeed , calculating the flux of @xmath55 through the sphere @xmath56 one finds that it _ depends on @xmath10 _ , see , e.  g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 20 ) ) and the sentence below it . likewise , for the wormhole of the second type the comparison of our formula with that for @xmath57 in @xcite",
    "gives the flux @xmath58 .",
    "so , @xmath59 is _ not _ the self - force , but rather another , much less meaningful , quantity | the force acting on the pointlike charge located in @xmath10 in the presence of a wormhole with the charge @xmath60 .",
    "in this section we establish the uniqueness of the solution of equation   up to the term @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a certain function of @xmath4 ( specified below ) , while @xmath7 and @xmath63 do not depend on @xmath4 .",
