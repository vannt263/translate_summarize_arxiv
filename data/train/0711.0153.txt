    "an important setting for experimental and theoretical studies of dynamical phenomena in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is provided by nearly one - dimensional ( 1d ) cigar - shaped \" traps , which assumes tight confinement in the transverse plane , allowing to unravel the dynamics along the longitudinal axis .",
    "the use of this geometry helped to achieve famous experimental results , such as the creation of single khaykovich02 and multiple @xcite bright solitons in the condensate of @xmath0several thousand @xmath1li atoms . in those experiments ,",
    "the strength of the interaction between atoms was controlled and made weakly attractive by means of the feshbach - resonance technique . in the condensate of @xmath2rb atoms trapped in a similar geometry , nearly 3d solitons",
    "were found in a post - collapse state @xcite .",
    "it is natural to derive effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) equation(s ) for the description of this experimentally relevant setting , starting from the full 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "the reduction of the 3d equation to a 1d form was performed , under various assumptions , by means of sundry methods @xcite-@xcite . in the simplest approximation ,",
    "the difference of the eventual equation from a formal 1d variant of the gpe ( with the underlying cubic nonlinearity ) is represented by an additional quintic term , whose sign is always self - attractive , irrespective of the sign of the cubic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "a more consistent approach to the derivation of the 1d equation postulates the factorization of the 3d mean - field wave function into the product of the ground state of the 2d harmonic oscillator in the transverse plane , and slowly varying axial ( 1d ) wave function . using the variational representation of the underlying 3d gpe",
    ", this approach ends up with the _ nonpolynomial schrdinger equation _ ( npse ) for the axial wave function @xcite .",
    "the npse has been extended to investigate the tonks - girardeau regime sala - tonks , the two - component bec @xcite , and also transverse spatial modulations @xcite .",
    "another physically interesting modification of the above setting is that when the bec trapped in the cigar - shaped geometry is lent vorticity ( assuming that the corresponding vector of the angular momentum is directed parallel to axis of the cigar - shaped trap ) , as proposed in ref .",
    "sala - vortex . in the experiment ,",
    "the vorticity may be imparted on the condensate by a helical laser beam shining along the axis of the trap .",
    "a natural problem for the theoretical analysis , which is considered in the present work , is the derivation of a modification of the effective one - dimensional npse that takes into regard the intrinsic vorticity . as we demonstrate in section ii",
    ", such a modified 1d equation is not drastically different from its counterpart derived before @xcite for the zero - vorticity states .",
    "however , a really nontrivial issue is to compare basic dynamical states predicted by this effective equation with direct numerical solutions of the underlying gpe in three dimensions . in this work ,",
    "we perform the comparison separately for the self - repulsive and self - attractive bec ( in sections iii and iv , respectively ) . in the former case ,",
    "the relevant states are of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) type , while in the latter model ( self - attraction ) these are bright solitons .",
    "we demonstrate that the modified npse provides for very good approximation for all these states , including the prediction of their stability ( and , in particular , of the collapse threshold for solitons in the self - attraction model ) .",
    "in addition , in section v we consider a different geometry , when the long quasi-1d trap is bent and closed into a ring ( torus ) , maintaining the intrinsic vorticity in the transverse plane . in that case , we find that the modified npse accurately predicts the shape and stability of a possible soliton , as well as the delocalization transition to the state of the bec uniformly filling the toroidal trap .",
    "the description of a dilute bec , confined in the axial direction by a generic potential @xmath3 , and in the transverse plane by the harmonic potential with frequency @xmath4 , is based on the fundamental gpe in three dimensions @xmath5 \\psi \\ ; ,   \\label{3dgpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the macroscopic wave function of the condensate normalized to unity , and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the number of atoms , @xmath9 the length of the transverse harmonic confinement , and @xmath10 the scattering length of atomic collisions . in eq .",

    "( [ 3dgpe - vortex ] ) numerically by using the finite - difference crank - nicholson predictor - corrector method with the cylindric symmetry described in ref .",
    "the crank - nicholson algorithm with imaginary time is used to find the stationary wave function of the gpe with a fixed vorticity @xmath16 .",
    "the algorithm provides for fast convergence to a finite - size wave function with finite energy . in the case of instability due to collapse ( @xmath21 )",
    "the algorithm quickly approaches a delta peak with ( negative ) diverging energy .",
    "note that , in the free space , vortices are usually destroyed by the instability against azimuthal perturbations @xcite , which split them into a set of separating fragments @xcite , but in our setting this instability is suppressed by the tight transverse confinement .    to gain some analytical insight and to reduce the problem to 1-d",
    ", we apply a variational approach . in the case of a cigar - shaped geometry ,",
    "it is natural to extend the variational representation @xcite of the 3d gpe which led to the npse for the axial wave function in the case of no vorticity to the present situation .",
