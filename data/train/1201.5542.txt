    "gaudin - type models represent a fertile basis for an exact approach to the dynamics of quantum many - body systems . these models do not require fine - tuning of the hamiltonian s parameters to satisfy integrability conditions .",
    "this is especially attractive from an applicational point of view since these parameters can represent physical coupling of the model .",
    "a particular example would be the central spin hamiltonian@xcite where the coupling constants between the central spin and the individual surrounding spins are related to the parameters of the gaudin model in a simple way .",
    "we are talking about a non - degenerate model when all these couplings are different .",
    "non - degenerate gaudin - type models have received considerable attention recently . apart from central spin physics they are relevant to a mesoscopic bcs@xcite , dicke model@xcite , lipkin - meshkov - glick and many other physical models@xcite .",
    "however in many physical situations there are natural degeneracies coming from the spectrum of the model .",
    "thus , in the bcs model the bare dispersion relation @xmath0 of paired fermions on a d - dimensional finite lattice defines the coupling constants of the gaudin model according to a simple equation , @xmath1 . on a regular lattice",
    "this equation may have several solutions , and thus the spectrum of gaudin parameters @xmath2 is degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy depends on the geometry of the lattice and is normally a number of the order of one .",
    "recently we introduced a fruitful approach for solving bethe equations for the gaudin models @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to use an equivalent reformulation of the complex coupled bethe ansatz equations in terms of an ordinary differential equation , a method known as ba / ode correspondence @xcite . in the spirit of our previous work , here we generalize our approach to degenerate systems .",
    "it was previously shown @xcite that in certain non - equilibrium situations in the non - degenerate richardson model the number of relevant eigenstates ( those bringing a non - negligible contribution to the wave function ) can be small drastically reducing the effective hilbert space . however , in more general situations , a large number of eigenstates can be necessary therefore making an efficient solver desirable .",
    "degeneracies can play an important role in this respect since the number of solutions to the bethe equations is automatically reduced compared to a equally large non - degenerate system .",
    "moreover we show that the matrix equations involved become super - sparse for high degeneracies leading to further simplifications .",
    "this property allows us to improve the system size without loosing computational speed and study dynamics of extremely large systems compared to the usual bethe ansatz solvable models s size for non - degenerate systems .    in the end",
    "we are looking for polynomial solutions to a second order differential equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ secondode ] ) ) a procedure which is in every regard equivalent to the heine - stieltjes polynomial approach discussed in @xcite for example . here",
    "the differential equation depends on a non - trivial set of parameters which we first extract from the solutions of an ensemble of quadratic algebraic equations according to the procedure described in sections [ batoode ] to [ proceed ] .",
    "the first one summarizes the results of our previous paper @xcite , while in the following we explicitly derive all the relevant equations for the degenerate case .",
    "the polynomial of interest can then be obtained using a new method based on the lagrange polynomial basis which is explained in section [ rootex ] and can be used for both degenerate or non - degenerate gaudin model .",
    "the techniques discussed are finally applied to the richardson model on a square lattice [ bcs ] .",
    "this work deals with a set of quantum integrable models which fall in the rational family of gaudin models defined by the following operator algebra @xmath3&=ig\\frac{s^{\\kappa+2}(\\lambda_i)-s^{\\kappa+2}(\\lambda_j)}{\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j}\\nonumber\\\\ [ s^\\kappa(\\lambda_i),s^\\kappa(\\lambda_j)]&=0,\\kappa = x , y , z . \\label{algebra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any realization of the rational gaudin algebra a set of @xmath4 commuting operators @xmath5 can be defined , therefore allowing the construction of exactly solvable hamiltonians of the form @xmath6 .",
    "the reduced bcs hamiltonian on a regular lattice @xmath7 is a natural example of a degenerate model built according to @xmath8 and will be illustrated in section [ bcs ] .",
    "this paper s aim is to provide an efficient and numerically stable algorithm which allows one to find exact eigenstates of this particular type of models by exploiting its quantum integrability through the algebraic bethe ansatz .    in this formalism , by defining a pseudovacuum @xmath9 , one can write exact eigenstates of the system in a remarkably compact form defined by the repeated action of a gaudin operator on |\\{_1 ... _ m } > _ i ^+(_i ) | 0 > .",
    "[ bethestate ] here @xmath10 plays the role of a generalized creation operator parametrized by a single complex variable @xmath11 whose explicit expression in terms of the fundamental operators defining a particular system will be model dependent @xcite . in every case ,",
    "the pseudo vacuum @xmath9 is defined as a lowest weight vector such that @xmath12 for any value of @xmath11 which would be the fock vacuum in the case of the reduced bcs hamiltonian .",
    "this set of general states become eigenstates of the hamiltonian provided the rapidities are solutions to the set of non - linear algebraic equations collectively known as bethe equations . specializing to rational gaudin models , the general form of bethe equations we address is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14    we will denote the ensemble of n distinct @xmath15 as `` energy levels '' , @xmath16 as the `` coupling constant '' and @xmath17 as the `` total number of levels '' ( for non - degenerate systems @xmath18 , otherwise degeneracies make @xmath19 ) .",
    "while the physical nature of these parameters differs from model to model , in the richardson case discussed here these parameters do indeed correspond respectively to single particle energy levels and coupling constant .    to each distinct energy @xmath20",
    "we can associate a degeneracy @xmath21 and a ( pseudo-)spin magnitude @xmath22 . the coefficients @xmath23 are then a product of those two values @xmath24 . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we deal only with degenerate spin @xmath25 systems and we therefore fix all @xmath26 and have @xmath27 .",
    "an arbitrary spin would simply modify @xmath23 in a way which is strictly equivalent to a larger degeneracy .",
    "one should note here that a degeneracy in the energy levels or a larger spin actually differ since in the degenerate case the solutions to the bethe equations no longer form a complete basis of the hilbert space .",
    "however the resulting subspace is orthogonal to the rest of the hilbert space and therefore even for non - equilibrium problems , provided the initial condition only involves this subspace , its elements remain the only states required to study the unitary time evolution .",
    "this work only addresses the numerical issues associated with finding the particular subset of eigenstates corresponding to solutions of eq .",
    "( [ bethe ] ) applied to the particular pseudovacuum defined before .",
    "solutions of ( [ bethe ] ) are found by scanning from the starting point @xmath28 for which the solutions are known ( @xmath29 for the richardson model ) and going to finite @xmath16 via successive steps .",
    "rapidities @xmath30 can be real or pairs of complex conjugates , the points in @xmath16 at which two real rapidities form a complex pair ( or vice versa ) can lead to numerical instabilities when working directly with the @xmath30 themselves . in @xcite an algorithm which finds these points beforehand allowing one to control",
    "the equations in the critical regions has been proposed . here however , in order to avoid these difficulties , we simply introduce the function @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath33 then correspond to the roots @xmath30 of the bethe equations ( ba ) .",
    "one can easily show that , whenever the set of rapidities @xmath34 satisfies ba , the ode @xmath35 is satisfied .",
    "if we restrict our investigation to non degenerate spin @xmath25 systems we would only need to solve the simple quadratic equations @xmath36 which are obtained by taking the limit @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ riccati ] ) , setting @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "once a set @xmath40 , solution to eq .",
    "( [ quadratic ] ) is found , the corresponding set of rapidities @xmath41 can be obtained by solving only linear equations and running a standard root finding algorithm . while in previous publications@xcite it was suggested to use elementary symmetric polynomials to build the linear system , in section [ rootex ] we propose to use a different polynomial basis which leads to much improved numerical stability .",
    "for the generalization to degenerate systems we obtain successive differential equations by taking the first @xmath42 derivatives of eq .",
    "( [ riccati ] ) , to do that let us fix some notations first . for each pair @xmath43 we then have to solve a system of equations which contains the first @xmath44 derivatives of ( [ riccati ] ) and the first @xmath44 derivatives of @xmath45 , this of course has to be done for all @xmath46 .    the general form of the @xmath42 derivative of ( [ riccati ] ) is derived in appendix [ derivation ] . eq .",
    "( [ matej ] ) for @xmath47 reads @xmath48    with @xmath49    the last term of ( [ nthder ] ) cancels for @xmath50 .",
    "thus , given a set of pairs @xmath51 , we define a closed set of quadratic algebraic equations by using , for each pair , the corresponding set of equations : i.e for @xmath52 we solve equation @xmath53 which depends on @xmath54 , for @xmath55 we solve @xmath56 in terms of @xmath57 and so on .",
    "once all the equations for @xmath45 and its derivatives are set , the fact that they are non - linear requires the use of an iterative method .",
    "to do so , one always needs an initial guess which constitutes a good enough approximation to guarantee convergence to the desired solution of the ba equations .",
    "as previously mentioned , this will be achieved by slowly increasing the coupling constant @xmath16 but to begin this process we need to solve the bethe equations in the weak coupling limit for a general degenerate system .",
    "the original form of ba equations is -_ik^m+_i=1^n+_k+=0 [ ba ] where @xmath4 is the number of distinct energies @xmath58 .",
    "we know already that for @xmath28 the roots will simply correspond to the values of the single energy states @xmath59 which are occupied ( the ( pseudo-)spins which are flipped with respect to the pseudo - vacuum ) . linearizing the system for weak coupling by inserting the solution _",
    "k=_j+g_k [ ans ] in ( [ ba ] ) , multiplying the obtained equation by @xmath16 and taking the limit @xmath60 , the ba equations become -_ik^r++b_j+c=0 [ prepol ] where @xmath61 is the number of roots occupying the single energy @xmath20 at @xmath28 .",
    "it is now possible to introduce the polynomial @xmath62 which has the property _ x_k=_ik .",
    "thus equation ( [ prepol ] ) can be written in the form of a differential equation ( in the limit @xmath63 ) d_jf-x f+(b_j+c)x f=0 .",
    "the function @xmath64 is a polynomial of the same degree @xmath61 as @xmath65 and with the same roots , the two polynomial are thus proportional to each other and the coefficient of proportionality is @xmath61 ( see   @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we have @xmath66 and the equation can be written as follows xf(x)-f(x)+rf(x)=0 .",
    "[ fin ] the known solutions of equation ( [ fin ] ) for @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( which encompasses the central spin and richardson models ) are the generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , for weak coupling , the solutions to the ba equations correspond to @xmath70 with @xmath71 roots of the laguerre polynomials @xmath69 .",
    "in order to solve the sets of quadratic equations defined by ( [ nthder ] ) we use a combination of taylor expansion to generate an approximative solution at @xmath72 and newton s method to refine this approximation . for both methods we need to solve a linear system of equations defined by the block-@xmath73matrix    @xmath74    in which each pair of indexes @xmath75 defines a matrix @xmath76 with matrix elements given by @xmath77    and for @xmath78    @xmath79    to have an idea of the structure of @xmath80 consider a @xmath81 system with @xmath82 , we would have @xmath83 which does contain a lot of zeros .",
    "it should be obvious that for very large systems with high degeneracies this sparse structure of @xmath80 will play an important role with respect to computation time .",
    "the taylor expansion allows us to take larger steps by taking into account the derivatives of @xmath84 with respect to @xmath16 . for a step",
    "@xmath85 the first guess will thus be given by @xmath86 where we note @xmath87 the function @xmath45 differentiated @xmath88 times with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath89 times with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath90derivatives in ( [ taylor ] ) can be found by recursively solving the linear system    @xmath91    and the elements of vector @xmath92 are given by    @xmath93    since only the rhs of ( [ derivg ] ) depends on @xmath89 we will only need to decompose matrix @xmath94 once ( using the usual approaches for linear systems such as qr decomposition , lu decomposition or inversion , ... ) and solve the linear system for the new vector @xmath92 up to a fixed number of derivatives .",
    "after the first guess is obtained a typical newton method can be used to finally get an accurate solution .",
    "having obtained solutions for the set of variables @xmath95 previously defined , it remains necessary to extract the actual rapidities from this set .",
    "in fact , slavnov s determinant formulas@xcite which give compact representations for scalar products and matrix elements , is yet only defined in terms of @xmath96 . in simple terms , one needs to find the roots of the polynomial @xmath33 which ultimately correspond to a given solution of the bethe equations ( [ bethe ] ) .",
    "while this constitutes a standard root - finding problem , the position of the roots in the complex plane can lead to numerical difficulties . in previous papers @xcite",
    "the monomial expansion @xmath97 was used . in this case , the coefficients are simply given in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials of the set @xmath96 which , in principle , can be found by solving a linear system of equations . for",
    "a non - degenerate model one would use @xmath98 equations given by    @xmath99    however as shown by wilkinson s numerical studies @xcite , expressing a polynomial in terms of its monomial expansion can give rise to serious numerical problems .",
    "in fact , the evaluation of the polynomial at a point @xmath100 far from 0 becomes very sensible to the finite numerical precision of the coefficients at large powers . at the end , the numerical error becomes rapidly sufficient to affect even the structure ( real vs. complex conjugate pairs ) of the roots . in order to circumvent that problem",
    "we use an alternative representation of the @xmath33 polynomial by decomposing it onto the basis of lagrange polynomials just like for polynomial interpolation . picking any grid of @xmath101 distinct points @xmath102 and the corresponding values @xmath103 one can exactly write    p(z ) = ( z ) _",

    "it is simple to show that the polynomial obeys the following second order ode :    p(z ) - f(z)p(z)+g(z)p(z ) = 0 [ secondode ]    with f(z ) & = & + + _",

    "we have a representation of the polynomial from which we can extract its zeros using the standard laguerre s method with deflation ( i.e. dividing by @xmath115 whenever a root @xmath116 is found ) . in this representation deflation",
    "is a very simple task as well since it can be performed by shifting one grid point , say @xmath117 , to the new found root @xmath116 . in doing",
    "so we simply set @xmath118 since the polynomial has a root at that point . at the other points we have @xmath119 due to the change in the barycentric weight @xmath120 .",
    "we can then reduce the degree of the polynomial by one by simply removing the @xmath121 point and repeat the procedure using the remaining @xmath122 grid points .    in this construction , we are free to choose the grid @xmath113 as we please and this fact can be exploited to ensure a numerically stable calculation . indeed , this representation of the polynomial is heavily sensitive to numerical precision only when evaluating the polynomial at points @xmath100 which are far from any grid point @xmath102 .",
    "provided one can define a grid which is close enough to the actual roots @xmath123 , the impact of finite numerical precision can be controlled . in any case , the remaining error on the rapidities extracted from this procedure can always be corrected by refining the values using the original bethe equations ( [ bethe ] ) .",
    "one should understand that an arbitrary set of @xmath102 can not provide a numerically stable extraction of the rapidities .",
    "however , contrarily to any fixed polynomial basis ( such as the monomial expansion for example ) , the lagrange basis always makes it possible to choose an appropriate interpolation grid which leads to a stable result .      whenever one is interested in studying the system for a wide variety of coupling strengths , the root extraction",
    "should then be performed at a number of intermediate points in the coupling strength scan .",
    "one could then simply define the grid points ( at @xmath124 ) as the roots found at the previous point @xmath125 which guarantees proximity of the grid to the actual solution and should always lead to numerically stable evaluation of the polynomial .",
    "however , when studying a single given value of the coupling strength it is prohibitively time - consuming to perform the root extraction at intermediate points and one should instead exploit our knowledge of the properties of any given solution to the bethe equations to define an appropriate set of points @xmath126 which mimics the positions of roots to be found .    at weak coupling ,",
    "every rapidity is contained within the bandwidth of the energy levels @xmath127 $ ] with each roots corresponding to a given energy level .",
    "it is then a trivial task to define a grid which is close to the roots . in the particular cases treated here and shown in figures ( [ raps60 ] ) and ( [ raps128 ] ) we choose two different sets of grid points .",
    "the first set , being the one which provides solutions to the ba at weak @xmath16 .",
    "here we use the linearized solution given by equation ( [ ans ] ) and substitute @xmath128 , in this way we ensure proximity to the actual solution but at the same time avoid the risk of having to evaluate @xmath129 at @xmath130 . at some point in the computation , the actual solution approaches the grid and the evaluation of @xmath129 leads to a loss of stability . since this occurs at a different point in @xmath16 depending on the state and the system size we simply use the original ba equations to determine how close the extracted roots are to the right solution .",
    "when a criterion on the precision is no longer met , we simply set the new grid to be equal to the rapidities calculated at the previous point keeping this grid for the remainder of the calculation .",
    "when interested only in performing the root extraction at strong coupling one can define a adequate grid without having to find roots at intermediate values . in this strong coupling regime we know that a subset of @xmath131 rapidities will diverge while the remaining @xmath132 stay finite with real parts contained within the previously mentioned bandwidth ( see figures ( [ raps60 ] ) and ( [ raps128 ] ) for examples ) .",
    "we therefore need a grid defined by @xmath132 points @xmath102 within the bandwidth and @xmath131 points which diverge in order to follow the diverging roots .    in @xcite it was shown that for non - degenerate spin-@xmath133 systems , provided @xmath134 ( @xcite ) , the configuration of roots at zero coupling is sufficient to determine the number @xmath131 of roots that will diverge in the strong coupling limit via a simple procedure .",

    "i-1 -(p_i + _ i-1 , h_i ) ] .    in the degenerate case ,",
    "the procedure remains exactly the same .",
