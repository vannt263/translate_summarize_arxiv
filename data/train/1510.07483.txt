    "when a set @xmath0 is invariant with respect to a system , all trajectories starting from @xmath1 remain in it forever .",
    "since almost every system in practice is subject to some type of constraints on its states or outputs , the notion of invariance becomes extremely relevant in control applications @xcite .",
    "specifically , problems related to safety and viability @xcite can be addressed by computing sets which possess the invariance property or a variant of it .    for linear switching systems , there are at least two approaches one can follow to compute invariant sets , namely use dynamic programming or find a lyapunov function and utilise its sub - level sets @xcite .",
    "the mechanism behind the first approach consists in iteratively computing elements of a convergent set sequence generated from the pre - image map , starting from an appropriately chosen initial set , ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) , @xcite .",
    "the second approach consists in first characterizing non - conservative families of candidate lyapunov functions and ( hopefully ) in developing a computational methodology for solving the corresponding conditions . for linear switching systems , polytopic @xcite , piecewise quadratic @xcite and sum of squares ( sos ) polynomial functions",
    "@xcite have been identified as universal , while efficient algorithmic procedures have been established using linear or semidefinite programming @xcite .",
    "apart from few exceptions that include the sub - level sets of min - of - quadratics and sos lyapunov functions , the available constructions concern invariant sets which are convex .",
    "this is not restrictive for the stability analysis problem .",
    "moreover , convex shapes recover the maximal invariant set for systems under polytopic constraints such as in figure  [ ex_figure1](a ) , since the convex hull of any invariant set preserves invariance .    nevertheless , the use of convex invariant sets or lyapunov functions is restrictive in the setting studied in this paper .",
    "indeed , when the constraint set is semi - algebraic , as for example in figure  [ ex_figure1](b ) , the maximal invariant set does not need to be convex .",
    "furthermore , modifying the standard approaches in order to deal with the non - convex case is not straightforward ; it is neither clear how to handle non - polytopic sets efficiently in dynamic programming nor how to identify and optimize over families of lyapunov functions which capture exactly the maximal invariant set .",
    "additional to the theoretical challenge , the practical motivation for dealing with systems under semi - algebraic constraints comes from a variety of applications found for example in the path planning and obstacle avoidance framework @xcite , in power electronics and in non - linear switching systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we solve both the problems of characterizing the maximal invariant set and of computing it efficiently .",
    "a first helpful observation towards achieving this goal is that semi - algebraic sets are represented by polyhedra in the lifted space induced by the veronese embedding .",
    "roughly , the veronese embedding is a nonlinear mapping of a vector @xmath2 to a higher dimensional space @xmath3 defined by the monomials @xmath4^\\top$ ] that are of order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 stands for the @xmath7-tuples that sum up to @xmath5 and construct each monomial .",
    "this lifting technique has been used with success in the past , see e.g. , @xcite , to deal with problems related to stability analysis and approximation of the joint spectral radius of switching systems .",
    "the lifted system enjoys the same stability property with the original system , and more importantly , it remains a switching linear system . taking this into account ,",
    "we are able to establish a relationship between invariant sets in the lifted and original state space .",
    "additionally , we characterize the maximal invariant set by applying a variant of the _ backward reachability algorithm _ @xcite in the lifted space .",
    "the corresponding set sequence may be initialized either with the lifted constraint set or with the , possibly unbounded , polyhedral set that is induced from the semi - algebraic constraint set .",
    "we address two specific challenges that arise depending on each choice , namely how to efficiently compute the reachability mapping in the former case and how to guarantee convergence in the latter case .",
    "we show that the maximal admissible invariant set is well - defined , it can be computed in a finite number of steps and it is expressed as the unit sub - level set of a max - polynomial function consisting of a finite number of pieces . to this end",
    ", we establish three possible algorithmic implementations for computing the maximal invariant set based on linear or semidefinite programs . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that the exact computation of the domain of attraction under non - convex constraints is possible .",
    "finally , it is worth to distinguish between the different research objectives set in this work from the ones found in the sos framework , see for example @xcite , where more complex dynamics and constraints are studied .",
    "the problem studied there concerns the assessment of local asymptotic stability in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point , however , no guarantee on the level of the approximation of the domain of attraction is sought or provided .",
    "another distinction should be made with the work in @xcite , where the focus is restricted to computing convex invariant approximations of the domain of attraction .    in section  [ section2 ] ,",
    "the basic definitions and the problem setting are presented , together with the technical details regarding the procedure of lifting the system and the constraint set . in section  [ section3 ]",
    ", we characterize the maximal admissible invariant set by first associating the invariance properties of sets in the lifted and original space and next by applying a modified version of the backward reachability algorithm .",
    "the corresponding algorithms are presented in section  [ section4 ] . in section  @xmath8",
    "two numerical examples are presented , whereas conclusions are drawn in section  @xmath9 .",
    "finally , further details concerning the algorithmic implementation of the results are exposed in the appendix .",
    "we denote the field of real numbers and the set of non - negative integers with @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "we write vectors @xmath12 with small letters and sets @xmath13 with capital letters in italics . the vector in @xmath14 with all elements equal to one",
    "is denoted by @xmath15 . for matrices and vectors , inequalities hold component - wise . given a @xmath7-tuple @xmath16 , the @xmath17 monomial of a vector @xmath2 is @xmath18 .",
    "the degree of the monomial is @xmath19 .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the multinomial coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a set consisting of @xmath23 matrices .",
    "the system under study is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the switching signal @xmath27 assigns at each time instant a matrix from the set @xmath28 .",
    "the system is subject to state constraints @xmath29 the state constraint set is of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , are polynomials of maximum degree @xmath33 .",
    "we are interested in characterizing the domain of attraction for the linear switching system subject to constraints . throughout the paper",
    ", we make the following assumptions .",
    "[ assumption1 ] the system is asymptotically stable .",
    "[ assumption2 ] the set @xmath34 is closed , bounded and contains the origin in its interior .",
    "assumption  [ assumption1 ] does not affect the generality of the problem since the admissible domain of attraction is different from the singleton set @xmath35 only if the switching linear system is asymptotically stable",
    ". moreover , under assumptions  [ assumption1 ] and [ assumption2 ] , the admissible domain of attraction coincides with the maximal admissible invariant set .",
    "the assumption that the origin is in the interior of the constraint set @xmath36 in assumption  [ assumption2 ] is a technical one , and it is required in the proofs of theorems  [ theorem1]-[theorem3 ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this assumption is taken in the standard problem of computing the maximal admissible invariant set for linear switching systems under polytopic constraints @xcite , while its removal , even when the constraint set is a polyhedron is still being investigated , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a set @xmath0 is called _ invariant _ with respect to the system if @xmath37 implies @xmath38 for all @xmath26 and any switching signal @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath39 , the set @xmath1 is called an _ admissible invariant set _ with respect to the system and the constraints .    [ def_maximal ] the set @xmath40 is called the _ maximal admissible invariant set _ with respect to the system and the constraints if it is admissible invariant , and , moreover , for any admissible invariant set @xmath39 , it holds that @xmath41 .",
