    "recently the large @xmath0 reduced models @xcite have been revived in the context of nonperturbative formulations of string theory @xcite . the iib matrix model @xcite , which is the reduced model of ten - dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theory , is expected to be a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory .    in this article , we study the large @xmath0 reduced model of yang - mills theory , which we refer to as the `` bosonic model '' in what follows .",
    "it is nothing but the bosonic part of the iib matrix model .",
    "the action is given by @xmath3 ^ 2),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 @xmath5 are @xmath2 traceless hermitian matrices .",
    "we investigate the dynamical aspects of the model related to the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , which correspond to the space - time coordinates in the iib matrix model .",
    "one of the most important quantities is the extent of the space time defined by @xmath6 .",
    "we also define a quantity which represents the uncertainty of the space - time coordinates and an order parameter for the ssb of the lorentz invariance .",
    "we determine these values for the bosonic model by monte carlo simulation .",
    "for @xmath1 @xmath7 2 with sufficiently large @xmath0 , the integral of @xmath4 is convergent without any cutoff because of an attractive potential between the eigenvalues of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this enables us to absorb @xmath8 by rescaling @xmath9 , which means that @xmath8 is nothing but a scale parameter .",
    "the large @xmath0 behavior of @xmath10 is , therefore , parametrized as @xmath11 , since @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath12 on dimensional grounds . in the iib matrix model",
    ", @xmath13 plays an important role to deduce the space - time dimension , which is to be determined dynamically from the eigenvalue distibution of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath13 for the bosonic model .",
    "the observables we measure are the following .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] . here",
    ", we have normalized the above quantities so that they are dimensionless , and hence they are independent of @xmath8 .",
    "we note that @xmath16 can be obtained analytically as @xmath17 @xcite .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : d4ulog ] , we show our results of monte carlo simulation for @xmath1 @xmath18 4 with @xmath0 @xmath18 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 .",
    "one can see that @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath16 are constant for @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d10ulog ] , we plot the data for @xmath1 @xmath18 10 with @xmath0 @xmath18 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 . here",
    "again we find that @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath16 are constant for @xmath22 .",
    "= 0.39    = 0.39    from these results , we find that @xmath10 is of the order of @xmath23 , which means that the upper bound determined by the perturbative argument is saturated",
    ". the large @xmath0 behaviors of @xmath24 are consistent with the predictions from the perturbative expansion and the @xmath25 expansion of this model @xcite .",
    "in the iib matrix model , the eigenvalues of @xmath26 represent the space - time coordinates .",
    "if @xmath26 s are commutable , they can be diagonalized simultaneously and the diagonal elements can be regarded as the classical space - time coordinates .",
    "therefore it makes sense to ask to what extent the classical space - time picture is broken . to discuss this issue",
    ", we define a quantity which represents the uncertainty of the space - time coordinates .",
    "we define such a quantity by the analogy to the quantum mechanics .",
    "we regard the matrices @xmath4 s as the linear operators which act on the linear space , which we identify as the space of states of particles .",
    "we take an orthonormal basis @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and identify @xmath27 with the state of the @xmath29-th particle .",
    "the space - time coordinate of the @xmath29-th particle is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "the uncertainty of the coordinate can be defined by @xmath31 we take an average of @xmath32 over all the particles and define the gauge - invariant quantity by @xmath33 note that @xmath34 if and only if @xmath4 are diagonalizable simultaneously .",
    "we plot @xmath35 obtained by monte carlo simulation in figs .",
    "[ fig : d4ulog ] and [ fig : d10ulog ] .",
    "we find that @xmath36 tends to a constant for large @xmath0 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath37 is of the same order as @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath38 were smaller than the typical distance between two particles , i.e. , @xmath39 , we might say that the classical space - time picture is good .",
    "our result , however , shows that the classical space - time picture is maximally broken .",
    "the ssb of lorentz invariance is of paramount importance in the iib matrix model , since if the space time is to be four - dimensional , the 10d lorentz invariance of the model must be spontaneously broken .",
    "the ssb of lorentz invariance can be probed by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 represents nothing but the variation of the eigenvalues of @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath44 is nonzero in the large @xmath0 limit , the lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken .",
    "thus , @xmath45 can be considered as an order parameter of the ssb of lorentz invariance . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we show that when the large @xmath0 factorization holds , the order parameter goes to zero in the @xmath46 limit .",
    "indeed , we show that at all orders of the @xmath25 expansion , the factorization holds and the order parameter behaves as @xmath47 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5d ] we plot @xmath48 against @xmath0 for @xmath1 @xmath18 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 . we see that the order parameter vanishes in the large @xmath0 limit , which means that the lorentz invariance is not spontaneously broken .",
    "note also that the large @xmath0 behavior of the order parameter can be nicely fitted to @xmath47 .",
    "this is in accordance with the prediction by the @xmath25 expansion .",
    "we studied the dynamical aspects of the reduced model of bosonic yang - mills theory .",
    "we determined the extent of the space time and showed that the classical space - time picture is maximally broken .",
    "we also showed that lorentz invariance is not spontaneously broken .",
    "we expect that our findings for the bosonic model provide a helpful comparison when we investigate the iib matrix model .",
