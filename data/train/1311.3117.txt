    "if two ends of a conductor are held at different temperatures , electrons from the hot end diffuse towards the cold one.@xcite this phenomenon , discovered by seebeck , is the basis for various thermoelectric charge - transport effects and plays a key role in the development of energy - saving technologies . with the emergence of spintronics as a new area of mesoscopic physics ,",
    "whose main objective is to utilize the electron spin in device operations , spin - related thermoelectricity has become of high interest.@xcite even though the generation of electromotive force by temperature gradient has been known long ago , the spin analog of the seebeck effect , known as the spin seebeck effect ( sse ) , was discovered only very recently.@xcite in the latter experiment , temperature gradient along a ferromagnetic slab generated a pure spin current over a long distance , much longer than in typical injection experiments , where spin current ( and also spin voltage ) disappears over distances longer than the spin - diffusion length.@xcite the sse was observed not only in metallic ferromagnets ( like co@xmath0mnsi)@xcite or semiconducting ferromagnets ( e.g. gamnas),@xcite but also in magnetic insulators lay@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and ( mn , zn)fe@xmath0o@xmath3.@xcite explanation of the effect observed experimentally in insulating magnets can not rely on conduction electrons and requires a more general approach .    the seebeck effect is usually quantified by the seebeck coefficient @xmath4 which is defined as the ratio of the generated electric voltage @xmath5 to the temperature difference @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the magnitude of the seebeck coefficient @xmath4 depends on the scattering rate and the density of electron states at the fermi level , and thus it is different in different materials . in the case of sse ,",
    "the spin voltage is formally determined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the electrochemical potentials for spin - up and spin - down electrons , respectively .",
    "usually , the density of states and the scattering rate for spin - up and spin - down electrons are different , which results in different seebeck constants for the two spin channels . therefore ,",
    "in a metallic magnet subjected to a temperature gradient , the electrons in different spin channels generate different driving forces , leading to a spin voltage that drives a nonzero spin current .",
    "in this paper we study the spin current flowing through the normal - metal / ferromagnet interface due to the thermal bias applied to the system .",
    "we consider the system and the model studied recently by xiao _",
    "et al_.@xcite however , we use a different approach and also consider in detail the influence of an external magnetic field and of the magnetic anisotropy . as in ref . , we assume that the electron - phonon interactions in both normal - metal and ferromagnetic subsystems are predominant , as compared to the interface effects . therefore , the phonon and electron reservoirs in both normal - metal and ferromagnet thermalize internally before the thermal equilibrium between the ferromagnet and normal - metal appears . in terms of the local temperature , which is based on the hierarchy of relaxation times ,",
    "this means that the temperatures of the phonon ( @xmath10 ) and the electron ( @xmath11 ) baths are equal in both the normal - metal ( @xmath12 ) and the ferromagnet ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 , @xmath15 . however , there is a difference in temperatures of the subsystems , @xmath16 , which is externally controlled .",
    "this difference drives the sse .",
    "the interaction between the normal - metal and the ferromagnet subsystems is mediated _ via _ the magnon bath .",
    "the temperature of the magnon bath deviates from the temperature of the electron and the phonon baths , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    as shown in ref .",
    ", two different spin currents contribute to the total spin current flowing through the normal - metal / ferromagnet interface .",
    "one of them is the spin current emitted from the ferromagnet to the normal metal due to the thermally activated magnetization dynamics in the ferromagnet .",
    "this spin current is referred to as the spin - pump current , @xmath19 .",
    "the second contribution to the total spin current has the opposite nature and flows in the opposite direction  from normal metal to the ferromagnet .",
    "this contribution follows from the thermal noise in the normal metal and will be referred to as the spin - torque current , @xmath20 . in order to evaluate the spin current flowing through the interface between normal metal and ferromagnet , xiao et al  @xcite used the linearized landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation and found that the spin current is proportional to the difference in the temperatures of the magnon system @xmath21 and electron subsystem in the normal metal @xmath22 .",
    "here we address this problem using a different method , which is based on the fokker - planck equation for the stochastic llg equation .",
    "we also distinguish between the influence of magnetic anisotropy and external magnetic field on the spin seebeck effect . as in the linearized approach",
    "the role of magnetic anisotropy is similar to that of an external magnetic field and can be described by some effective field , this is not the case when fluctuations are large .",
    "we demonstrate that the spin current obtained within the framework of the linear response theory is a particular case of the result obtained using the fokker - planck approach , and corresponds to the low temperature approximation for the magnon temperature . apart from this ,",
    "we show that the spin current saturates with increasing magnon temperature , and the saturation temperature increases with increasing magnetic field and/or magnetic anisotropy .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is solved in section iii , where two cases are distinguished : ( i ) the case with dominant external field , and ( ii ) the case where the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy field is dominant .",
    "summary and final conclusions are in section iv .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic metallic layer which is in direct contact with a nonmagnetic metallic layer .",

    "( [ eq.10 ] ) and ( [ eq.11 ] ) one can write the final result for the spin current density in the form @xmath74    we see that the average spin current depends on two physical parameters : ( i ) the ratio of the magnetic energy in the external field to the thermal energy corresponding to the magnon temperature , @xmath75 , and ( ii ) the difference between the magnon temperature and the temperature of the electron - phonon bath in the normal metal , @xmath76 .",
    "the dependence of the average spin current on the field is factorized in the langevin function , eq.([eq.12 ] ) . therefore , introducing the notation @xmath77 for the mean spin current calculated in the linear response approach , @xmath78,@xcite one can rewrite eq.([eq.12 ] ) in the compact form as @xmath79 .    in the limit of a low magnon temperature , @xmath80",

    "this means that the spin current calculated using the fokker - plank approach , without a linearization of the system , gives the same result as that obtained in the linear response .",
    "the physical reason for this is clear .",
    "indeed , in the case of a strong magnetic field , the magnetization vector tends to be aligned along the field direction , and nonlinear effects in the magnetization dynamics related to large deviation from the equilibrium are less relevant .",
    "however , in the opposite case , corresponding to the high magnon temperature , @xmath82 , and strong magnetization fluctuations , the nonlinear effects in the magnetization dynamics are much more important .",
    "consequently , the spin current is different from @xmath83 and reads @xmath84 .",

    "the dotted ( green ) line corresponds to the linear response theory , whereas all other curves correspond to the fokker planck approach .",
    "we note that in contrast to the linear response theory , the fokker - planck approach leads to the spin current that saturates for high magnon temperatures .",
    "this , in turn , means that the linear response is valid only in a narrow range of the magnon temperatures .",
    "note , that all the curves cross the same point for @xmath95 as there are then no thermal fluctuations in the magnon system , and thus the only contribution comes from thermal noise in the nonmagnetic film .",
    "deviation from the description based on the linearized model is especially large for small magnetic fields and appears already at low magnon temperatures ( see the curve for @xmath96 oe in fig.1 ) . in this case",
    ", the saturation of the spin current also appears at low temperatures . for higher magnetic field ,",
    "the deviation is smaller and appears at higher magnon temperatures .",
    "this behavior is reasonable as the fluctuations at low magnetic fields are larger , and therefore difference between linearized model and description based on the fokker planck equation appears at lower magnon temperatures",

    "apart from this , it is interesting to note , that @xmath102 tends to zero in the limit of zero magnetic field .",
    "this behavior can be accounted for by noting that @xmath103 for zero magnetic field , so the zero - field magnetic fluctuations are large . in this limit",
