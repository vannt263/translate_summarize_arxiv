    "perhaps the simplest of all procedures that one can think of for generating new exact solutions of einstein s equations is the use of conformal transformations .",
    "unfortunately , when applied to vacuum , no new solutions emerge via this procedure @xcite .",
    "however , when considering static fluid spheres in isotropic coordinates , the seed metric is not vacuum , but an unphysical fluid with pressure but zero energy density and viable new solutions do indeed emerge .",
    "we now have a rather vast array of methods for generating static fluid spheres @xcite , with many of the successful procedures relying on what amounts to the development of a linear equation of first order , for example @xcite and @xcite . in isotropic",
    "coordinates linear equations do not emerge directly @xcite .",
    "rather , specifying one of the two metric functions leads to a differential equation of the riccati type .",
    "here we do not specify either metric function but rather solve two equations of the riccati type coupled by a single generating function .",
    "whereas we are able to solve this system for a variety of generating functions , we have found only one class of generating functions that gives rise to tractable and physically interesting solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "consider spacetimes @xmath0 that are static conformal transformations of seed metrics @xmath1 where @xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the metric of a unit sphere ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 is a freely specifiable function @xmath7 .",
    "we suppose that the mathematical fluid associated with @xmath0 is generated by streamlines of constant @xmath8 and @xmath9 . since this flow is shear free , the necessary and sufficient condition for ( [ conformal ] ) to represent a static perfect fluid is given by the walker pressure isotropy condition @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the einstein tensor .",
    "the energy density is defined by @xmath12 and the pressure by @xmath13 and for ( [ condition ] ) we assume that @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ condition ] ) , along with the definitions for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , is equivalent to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "the spacetimes @xmath1 ( for any constant @xmath6 ) do not represent physically acceptable static fluid spheres since they all have zero energy density . what we are interested in are spacetimes @xmath0 that represent physically acceptable exact perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations .    from condition ( [ condition ] )",
    "we find @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the energy density is given by @xmath20 independent of @xmath21 , and the pressure is given by @xmath22 where @xmath21 and @xmath6 are linked by ( [ phipart ] ) .",
    "it is clear from ( [ density ] ) that @xmath6 must have a local maximum at @xmath23 and so from ( [ fpart ] ) we must have @xmath24 .",
    "let us specify @xmath6 and solve for @xmath21 from ( [ phipart ] ) .",
    "the formal solution is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "since equation ( [ j ] ) may be solved analytically only for certain @xmath28 , we can ask what @xmath6 gives rise to this particular @xmath28 ?",
    "the answer follows from ( [ fpart ] ) and is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "alternatively , we can specify @xmath21 and solve for @xmath6 .",
    "this is equivalent to ( [ f ] ) with ( [ btilda ] ) where we consider @xmath28 generated from ( [ phipart ] ) .",
    "again , we can ask what @xmath21 generated a particular @xmath28 .",
    "the solution is given by ( [ methoda ] ) with ( [ j ] ) .",
    "in either case our ability to proceed revolves around our ability to solve riccati equations of the type ( [ j ] ) and ( [ btilda ] ) .    in the usual way ,",
    "equations ( [ j ] ) and ( [ btilda ] ) can be written in linear form as @xmath32 and @xmath33 where , up to a scale factor in @xmath34 and a constant conformal factor , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . rather than specify @xmath6 or @xmath21 , here equations ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) are solved simultaneously , coupled by the generating function @xmath28 . the solutions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , of course , quite different in general and , as explained below , distinct even for @xmath39 .",
    "given a particular solution to a riccati type equation , standard procedures @xcite allow the construction of more general solutions .",
    "however , this procedure for generating solutions usually starts from very simple particular solutions , and we have found no non - trivial known solutions applicable to the system ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) .",
    "rather , what we have done is to use the computer algebra system maple @xcite to generate solutions to this system .    to motivate our choice for @xmath28 , first consider @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants and @xmath43 is a ratio of integers .",
    "this gives @xmath44 which distinguishes two special cases for which @xmath39 : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to note that ( [ firstf ] ) is but a special case that leads to ( [ specialj ] ) . with @xmath39 , @xmath47 where @xmath27 and @xmath48 are constants .",
    "the cases @xmath45 are physically unacceptable , since , as explained above , the associated energy density vanishes .",
    "all cases with @xmath46 are conformally flat and so represent the well - known schwarzschild interior solution @xcite .",
    "a special case is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 which is the einstein static universe .",
    "( a cosmological constant @xmath51 can be introduced to give zero pressure . )",
    "motivated by the foregoing , we have considered the generating functions @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are integers , and have been able to solve the riccati system ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) analytically for the integers shown in table [ solutions ] .",
    ".[solutions]analytic solutions [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , solving the differential equations does not mean that we can find a physically acceptable , or even tractable , solution to the einstein equations .",
    "in some cases ( e.g. @xmath55 ) we have been unable to construct the associated energy density and pressure simply due to the complexity of the background spacetime . in other cases ( e.g. @xmath56 )",
    "the most elementary physical requirements can not be met ( finite positive @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the origin @xmath23 with monotone decreasing values outward ) . of the solutions represented in table [ solutions ]",
    "we have found only one case of physical interest : ( @xmath57 ) , that is , ( [ specialj ] ) .",
    "now starting with ( [ specialj ] ) from ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) we find @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 where the @xmath61 are constants . from ( [ n ] ) we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 . whereas the metric is remarkably simple , the resultant expressions for the energy density and isotropic pressure are very long and not reproduced here .",
    "we resort to graphical demonstrations .",
    "the fact that the energy density is unaffected by @xmath21 is demonstrated in figure [ c1c2var ] where we have varied @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "two sets of curves shown coincide .",
    "this degeneracy arises due to the fact that we have not set a scale for @xmath34 .    in figure [ c3var ]",
    "we have varied @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "again , two sets of curves shown coincide .",
    "this degeneracy arises due to the fact that the essential physics does not change under a constant conformal transformation .",
    "an explicit four - fold infinity of new physically acceptable exact perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations have been generated by solving two equations of the riccati type coupled by a single generating function rather than specifying one of the metric functions .",
    "special cases of these solutions include the schwarzschild interior solution and the einstein static universe .",
    "the solutions are qualitatively similar to the tolman iv solution ( see for example @xcite ) and so should be of interest for the study of internal properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
