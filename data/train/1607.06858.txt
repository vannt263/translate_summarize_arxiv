    "one of the proposed solutions to the hierarchy problem among the fundamental forces is the introduction of compact extra dimensions .",
    "however , this creates a new hierarchy problem between the weak forces and the size of the compact extra dimensions .",
    "a possible solution was suggested by randall and sundrum @xcite by introducing a non - compact extra dimension . in that model ,",
    "the observed universe is a four - dimensional spacetime embedded in a five - dimensional anti - de - sitter space ( ads5 ) .    the projected three - space friedmann equation of the five dimensional universe reduces to @xcite : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the scale factor for the three - space at time @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the energy density of matter in the normal three space .",
    "@xmath8 is the four dimensional gravitational constant and is related to its five dimensional counterpart @xmath9 by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the intrinsic tension on the brane and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the five dimensional plank mass .",
    "the @xmath14 in the third term on the right - hand side is the four dimensional cosmological constant and is related to its five dimensional counterpart by @xmath15 note that for @xmath16 to be close to zero , @xmath17 should be negative .    in standard friedmann cosmology",
    "only the first three terms arise .",
    "the fourth term is probably negligible during most of the radiation dominated epoch since @xmath18 decays as @xmath19 in the early universe , although it could be significant during the beginning of the epoch of inflation @xcite .",
    "the last term is the dark radiation @xcite .",
    "it is called radiation since it scales as @xmath20 .",
    "it is a constant of integration that arises from the projected weyl tensor describing the effect of graviton degrees of freedom on the dynamics of the brane .",
    "one can think of it , therefore , as a projection of the curvature in higher dimensions . in principle",
    "it could be either positive or negative .",
    "although it is dubbed dark radiation it is not related to relativistic particles .",
    "nevertheless , since it scales like radiation , its presence can alter the expansion rate during the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "dark radiation can have significant effects on the light element abundances produced during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "it also affects the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "altering the expansion rate changes the temperature at which various nuclear reactions freeze out .",
    "this leads to deviations in the final bbn light element abundances . in this paper",
    "we define @xmath21 as the energy density of the dark radiation , and parameterize @xmath22 to be the ratio of the energy density of the dark radiation to the total energy density in relativistic particles at 10 mev ( before @xmath23 annihilation ) .",
    "the corresponding changes in the bbn abundances and the cmb power spectrum are then computed .",
    "the light element abundances present at the end of bbn can be used to constrain the physical conditions during the nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "we use a standard bbn code @xcite with a number of reaction rates updated @xcite .",
    "we also replaced the modified bessel function approximation with a more accurate fermi - integral solver and checked for any differences in the final abundances . the primordial helium abundance ( @xmath24 )",
    "is deduced from hii regions in metal poor irregular galaxies extrapolated to zero metallicity @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath25 from @xcite .",
    "deuterium is measured from the spectra of lyman - alpha absorption systems in the foreground of high redshift qsos .",
    "a two sigma region of @xmath26 is adopted from @xcite .",
    "the addition of an extra energy density in the form of positive dark radiation has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of positive dark radiation implies extra energy density during bbn .",
    "this increases the cosmic expansion rate and causes the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a higher temperature . as a result ,",
    "the neutron to proton ratio increases , since the @xmath27 ratio is related to a simple boltzmann factor at freezeout , @xmath28 where @xmath29 mev is the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "the increased neutron mass fraction from a positive dark radiation term increases the d / h and @xmath24 abundances .",
    "in addition , the faster cosmic expansion results in the freezeout of the deuterium destruction via the reactions @xmath30h(@xmath31,@xmath32)@xmath33he and @xmath30h(@xmath31,@xmath34)@xmath33h at a higher temperature .",
    "this also leads to a larger deuterium abundance .",
    "the abundances of @xmath33h and @xmath33he are larger for a positive dark radiation .",
    "this is because these nuclides are mainly produced via the reactions @xmath30h(@xmath31,@xmath32)@xmath33he and @xmath30h(@xmath31,@xmath34)@xmath33h , respectively , and the deuterium abundance is higher .",
    "when the dark radiation is negative the opposite effect occurs .",
    "the primordial @xmath35li abundance is deduced from the observed abundances in low mass metal poor stars .",
    "for @xmath35li we adopt the @xmath36 constraint of @xcite @xmath37    there is a well known lithium problem @xcite whereby the predicted primordial lithium exceeds the observed primordial lithium abundance by about a factor of 3 for @xmath38 deduced from the _ planck _ analysis @xcite of the cmb primordial power spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows calculated light element abundances , @xmath24 , d / h , @xmath33he / h , and li / h as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the solid green line is the result for the standard bbn with no dark radiation .",
    "the dot dashed black line and the dashed blue line show the results of bbn in which the energy densities of the dark radiation are @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , of the total particle energy density .",
    "the two lines correspond to the cases of the upper and lower limits on @xmath40 derived from the constraints on light element abundances .",
    "the vertical solid blue lines enclose the @xmath41 constraint on @xmath39 @xcite .",

    ", d / h , @xmath33he / h , and li / h are plotted for a range of @xmath39 .",
    "the solid green line is the result for the standard bbn with no dark radiation .",
    "the dot dashed black line and the dashed blue line show the results of bbn in which the energy densities in dark radiation are @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , of the total relativistic particle energy density ( at 10 mev ) .",
    "the two lines correspond to the cases of the upper and lower limits on @xmath40 derived from the constraints on light element abundances .",
    "the vertical solid blue lines show the constraint on @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the horizontal purple lines correspond to the observational upper and lower limits on primordial abundances .",
    ", width=336 ]    for the case of positive dark radiation , we find a decrease of the @xmath35li abundance for @xmath42 and an increase for @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the primordial @xmath35li nuclei are produced as @xmath35li in the low @xmath39 region and @xmath35be in the high @xmath39 region during bbn .",
    "a positive dark radiation term leads to a slight excess of the @xmath35li abundance due to the following facts : ( 1 ) the @xmath35li nuclides are produced via @xmath44he(@xmath6,@xmath45)@xmath35li and the abundance of @xmath33h is higher , and ( 2 ) there is less time for the lithium destruction reaction @xmath35li@xmath46he .",
    "a positive dark radiation , on the other hand , decreases the @xmath35be abundance .",
    "the slight increase of the @xmath33he abundance results in a somewhat increased production rate of @xmath35be via the reaction @xmath47 .",
    "however , the significant increase of the neutron abundance leads to a considerably increased destruction rate of @xmath35be via the reaction @xmath35be(@xmath32,@xmath34)@xmath35li . as a result",
    ", the final @xmath35be abundance is decreased . in either case",
    ", dark radiation does not affect the primordial lithium abundance sufficiently to solve the lithium problem without violating the @xmath44he and deuterium constraints .",
    "hence , we presume that the lithium problem is solved by another means and do not utilize the @xmath35li abundance as a constraint on dark radiation .",
    "although the epoch of photon last scattering is in the matter dominated epoch , there remains an effect on the cmb power spectrum due to the still significant contribution from relativistic mass energy and the effect of the uniform dark radiation term on the acoustic oscillation of the cosmic fluid . on the other hand",
    ", the cmb power spectrum is very sensitive to a number of other parameters that have little or no effect on bbn .",
    "thus , to obtain a total constraint on the dark radiation contribution to energy density , we have performed a simultaneous fit to the _ tt _ power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cmb . to achieve this , we have fixed most of the cosmological parameters to their optimum values @xcite and only varied the dark radiation content and @xmath39 in the fit .",
    "fits were made to the _ planck _",
    "data @xcite using the camb code @xcite . in the limit of no dark radiation",
    "we recover the _ planck _",
    "value of @xmath48 @xcite . figure [ fig:2 ] shows the effect of adding dark radiation to the cmb _ tt _ power spectrum .",
    "this figure shows the usual normalized amplitude @xmath49 of the multipole expansion for the tt power spectrum as a function of the moment @xmath50 .",
    "as can be seen on this figure , a dark radiation term can shift the location and amplitude of the acoustic peaks and is therefore constrained by the cmb power spectrum .",
    "deviations as labeled.,width=3 ]    figure [ fig:3 ] shows constraints on @xmath39 vs. dark radiation based upon our fits to the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the contour lines on figure [ fig:3 ] show the @xmath51 and @xmath52 confidence limits in the @xmath39 vs.  dark radiation plane .",
    "the shaded regions show the bbn @xmath24 and d constraints as labeled .     vs.  @xmath53 plane .",
    "contour lines show the @xmath54 and @xmath52 confidence limits based upon our fits to the cmb power spectrum .",
    "dark shaded lines show the constraints from the primordial deuterium abundance as described in the text .",
    "the light shaded region shows the @xmath24 constraint.,width=3 ]    the best fit concordance shown in figure [ fig:3 ] is consistent with no dark radiation although there is a slight preference for positive dark radiation .",
    "this is contrary to the previous analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and can be traced to the new light - element constraints . also , it is worth mentioning here that the value of @xmath39 deduced from the wmap data is @xmath55 , while the ( wmap+ bao + h@xmath56 ) data is @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "so , the dark radiation constraint based upon the the wmap results would be nearly identical and would also have a slight preference for a positive dark radiation .",
    "in conclusion we deduce that the bbn constrains on dark radiation are in the range of @xmath0 to @xmath1 compared to the previous range @xcite of @xmath58 to @xmath59 . after taking into account the @xmath60 limits on the dark radiation from the fit to the cmb power spectrum",
    ", this region shrinks to a range of @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "the constraint for positive dark radiation comes from the upper bound on the @xmath44he mass fraction and the upper and lower bounds on the deuterium abundance .",
    "the limit to negative dark radiation arises from the lower limit to the @xmath44he mass fraction and the upper and lower bounds on the deuterium abundance ( or the cmb ) .",
    "we also checked the corresponding @xmath61li / h abundance for the allowed ranges of dark radiation .",
    "for dark radiation of @xmath1 and @xmath39 of @xmath62 the lithium abundance is @xmath63 slightly reducing the lithium problem . for a @xmath64 negative dark radiation of @xmath65 , the lithium abundance increases to @xmath66 exacerbating the lithium problem . hence , although a positive dark radiation slightly reduces the lithium abundance , it is not sufficient to solve the lithium problem .",
