    "the applied stress lowers the barrier that confines the bound pair . in the simplest model ,",
    "unbinding occurs where the location @xmath74 of the barrier , defined by @xmath75_{x = x_b}=0 $ ] , becomes comparable to @xmath7 , or @xmath76 . by solving for @xmath73 ,",
    "one obtains the critical radius @xmath77 where shear - induced dislocation unbinding occurs , yielding slippage of neighboring planes of the vortex lattice , @xmath78 , for @xmath26 , with @xmath79 a maximum current above which the entire vortex solid shear melts .",
    "the melting radius @xmath80 increases with current , indicating that , since the stresses are largest near the axis of the disk , `` shear - induced melting '' occurs first in circular layers close to the axis .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively consistent with the observations by the argonne group.@xcite the simple model described here suggests that at high fields the current scale @xmath81 is independent of field .",
