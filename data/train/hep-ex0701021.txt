    "several experiments  @xcite in the last years have detected the @xmath0 ground state as well as an excited state .",
    "recently at fermilab the photoproduction experiment , focus , reported an observation of a sample of 64  @xmath0 events and they measured its lifetime as @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the experiment wa89 published an @xmath0 lifetime measurement of @xmath11 from a sample of 86  events  @xcite .",
    "the present world average is @xmath12 as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . clearly",
    "additional measurements of lifetime as well as the branching ratios with more statistical accuracy are needed to test theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we report the results of a new measurement of the lifetime based on data from the hadroproduction experiment selex ( e781 ) at fermilab .",
    "the measurement is based on a sample of @xmath5 fully reconstructed @xmath13 from @xmath14 hadronic interactions .",
    "the selex detector at fermilab is a 3-stage magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the negatively charged @xmath1 beam contains nearly equal fractions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the positive beam contains @xmath17  protons .",
    "beam particles are identified as a baryon or a pion by a transition radiation detector .",
    "the spectrometer was designed to study charm production in the forward hemisphere with good mass and decay vertex resolution for charm momenta in the range @xmath18 .",
    "five interaction targets ( 2  cu and 3  c ) have a total target thickness of @xmath19 for protons .",
    "the targets are spaced by @xmath20 .",
    "downstream of the targets there are 20  silicon strip detectors ( ssd ) with a strip pitch of @xmath21 oriented in x ,  y ,  u and v views .",
    "the first spectrometer level has three multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) with @xmath22 wire spacing and @xmath23 area downstream of bending magnet m1 .",
    "the second spectrometer level has 7  mwpcs with @xmath24 wire spacing downstream of the second bending magnet m2 .",
    "each chamber has two sensitive planes in two orthogonal projections .",
    "the scattered - particle spectrometers have momentum cutoffs of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "typical momentum resolution for a @xmath27 track is @xmath28 .",
    "a ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( rich )  @xcite , filled with neon at room temperature and pressure , provides single track ring radius resolution of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 separation up to about @xmath32 .",
    "a layout of the spectrometer can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 decays studied here have a hyperon in the final state .",
    "hyperons that decay upstream of or within the m1 magnet are called _ kink _ tracks .",
    "they are characterized by one charged track that decays to another charged particle and a neutral particle undetected by the spectrometer .",
    "kink _ tracks differ from the majority of spectrometer tracks in that the vertex silicon track segment does not link to straight line tracks segments measured in the spectrometers after m1 and/or m2 .",
    "the _ kink _",
    "reconstruction algorithm examines all unlinked vertex ssd track segments that point to the m1 magnet aperture and tries to match each unlinked segment with an unlinked downstream track measured in the m1/m2 spectrometer , using momentum - energy conservation with thehypothesis of a specific hyperon decay .",
    "the momentum of the parent hyperon ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) is calculated using the assumed decay hypothesis .",
    "the daughter @xmath37 in @xmath38 decays must be rich identified with the likelihood to be a @xmath39 exceeding that of its being a @xmath16 .",
    "the charm trigger is very loose .",
    "it requires a valid beam track , at least 4  charged secondaries in the forward @xmath40 cone , and two hodoscope hits after the second bending magnet from tracks of charge opposite to that of the beam .",
    "we triggered on about 1/3 of all inelastic interactions .",
    "a computational filter linked mwpc tracks having momenta @xmath41 to hits in the vertex silicon and made a full reconstruction of these tracks together with a beam track to form primary and secondary vertices in the event .",
    "events consistent with only a primary vertex are not saved .",
    "about 1/8 of all triggers are written to tape , for a final sample of about @xmath42  events .    in the full analysis",
    "the vertex reconstruction was repeated with tracks of all momenta .",
    "the rich detector identified charged tracks above @xmath43 .",
    "results reported here come from a second pass reconstruction through the data , using a production code optimized for hyperon reconstruction .    to separate the signal from the non - charm background we require that : ( i ) the spatial separation @xmath44 between the reconstructed production and decay vertices exceeds 6  times the combined error @xmath45 , ( ii ) each decay track , extrapolated to the primary vertex @xmath46 position ,",
    "must miss by a transverse distance @xmath47 times its error @xmath48 , ( iii ) each candidate hyperon track , extrapolated to the _ kink _ vertex @xmath46 position , must have a good vertex quality ( @xmath49 ) , ( iv ) the secondary vertex must lie outside any target material by at least @xmath50 , and ( v ) decays must occur within a fiducial region",
    ".    the total transverse momentum of pions from the @xmath51 decay mode must be greater than @xmath52 with respect to the @xmath0 direction .",

    "the average combined error @xmath45 on the primary and secondary vertices and the average @xmath60 momentum give a proper time resolution of @xmath61 , about @xmath62 of @xmath63 .",
    "we used a binned maximum likelihood fitting technique with @xmath64 width bins to determine the @xmath65 lifetime .",
    "the fit was applied to a reduced proper time distribution , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the reconstructed charm mass , @xmath4 the reconstructed momentum , @xmath44 the measured vertex separation and @xmath68 the minimum @xmath44 for each event to pass all the imposed selection cuts .",
    "@xmath68 is determined event - by - event , along with the acceptance , by the procedure described below .",
    "we fitted all events with @xmath69 in the mass range @xmath70 , @xmath71 from the @xmath65 central mass value .",
    "the probability density function is : @xmath72 where @xmath73    the five parameters are : @xmath74 ( @xmath75 lifetime ) , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( background lifetimes ) , @xmath78 ( background fraction in the signal region ) and @xmath79 ( background splitting function ) .",
    "@xmath80 is the total number of events in the signal region .",
    "the function is the sum of a term for the @xmath65 exponential decay corrected by the acceptance function @xmath81 plus a background function @xmath82 consisting of two exponentials to describe the strong decays and charm decays respectively .",
    "its parameters were determined from the @xmath83 distribution from the @xmath65 sidebands . together",
    "the mass widths of the sideband background windows , @xmath84 and @xmath85 was equal to the signal mass window .",
    "the proper - time - dependent acceptance @xmath81 is independent of spectrometer features after the first magnet , e.g. ,  rich efficiency and tracking efficiency .",
    "these efficiencies affect only the overall number of events detected .",
    "the proper time distribution of these events depends crucially on vertex reconstruction . to evaluate @xmath81 we generated @xmath65 events with a @xmath86 distribution and decayed them using the qq package  @xcite .",
    "we embedded these generated decays into real data events and reconstructed the embedded decays with the offline package including multiple coulomb scattering in the spectrometer and the measured detector performance .",
    "the correction function was evaluated as the fraction of the embedded events passing the selection cuts .",
    "figure  [ fig : life ] shows the overall fits to the data distributions as a function of reduced proper time for @xmath87 and @xmath88 decay modes .",
    "it also shows the acceptance function @xmath89 , which does not differ significantly from unity and is constant .",
    "this is due to the fact @xmath68 is chosen 6  times the combined error @xmath45 . with selex s very high momentum and excellent resolution",
    "this cut removes only the first @xmath90 lifetimes from the sample .",
    ".lifetime fit results for the two @xmath91 decay modes analyzed .",

    "[ fig : life ] are also shown . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the systematic uncertainties for the @xmath55 lifetime analysis are listed in table  [ tab : sig ] and described below .",
    "lifetime shifts due to reconstruction errors have been well studied in our @xmath92 and @xmath93 work , with an order of magnitude higher statistics  @xcite .",
    "because of the high redundancy and good precision of the silicon vertex detector , vertex mismeasurement effects are small at all momenta .",
    "proper time assignment depends on correct momentum determination .",
    "the selex momentum error is less than @xmath28 in all cases .",
    "we assign a maximum systematic error from proper time mismeasurement of @xmath94 .",
    "the acceptance function used in the fit was parameterized with a 1st and 2nd order polynomial .",
    "the difference in lifetime result is @xmath95 .",
    "no significant difference in the lifetime correction function was found when we changed the @xmath96 value of the @xmath97 distribution from 3 to 1 .",
    "we varied the width of the sidebands and the bin size independently .",
    "the systematic error due to the fit procedure is @xmath98 .",
    "we have made a new measurement of the @xmath60 lifetime in two independent decay channels , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , using a maximum likelihood fit .",
    "selex measures the @xmath60 lifetime to be @xmath99 .",
