    "one of the most interesting phenomena in statistical physics is the presence , in the phase diagram of many physical systems , of `` critical points '' where some thermodynamic quantities or their derivatives diverge .",
    "experimentally , it is found that such divergences are usually of power law type , and therefore characterized by exponents , called critical exponents .",
    "the theory of critical phenomena , developed to explain this behavior , suggests the existence of large `` universality classes '' such that systems belonging to the same universality class have the same critical exponents .    a closely related notion of universality concerns the `` continuum scaling limit , '' which is obtained by sending the _ microscopic scale _ of the system ( e.g. , the mesh of the lattice , for discrete systems defined on a lattice ) to zero , while focusing on features manifested on a _",
    "macroscopic scale_. such a limit is only meaningful at the critical point , where the _ correlation length _ ( i.e. , the  natural \" length scale that characterizes the system ) is supposed to diverge .",
    "the concept of universality and the existence of universality classes arise naturally in the theory of critical phenomena ( based on renormalization group techniques ) , and are backed by strong theoretical and experimental evidence .",
    "nonetheless , very few rigorous results are available , especially below the upper critical dimension , where the values of the critical exponents are expected to be different from those predicted by mean - field theory ( there are , however , some exceptions  see , e.g. , @xcite for results concerning percolation and the ising model ) . the main aim of this paper is to present some rigorous results in support of the idea of universality in the context of percolation theory in two dimensions ( see  @xcite for detailed accounts on percolation theory ) .    in recent years",
    ", substantial progress has been made in understanding two - dimensional critical percolation and its conformally invariant scaling limit ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and in computing the percolation critical exponents by means of mathematically rigorous methods  @xcite . the new tool that made this possible is the stochastic loewner evolution introduced by schramm  @xcite , together with smirnov s proof  @xcite of the conformal invariance of the scaling limit of crossing probabilities for site percolation on the triangular lattice .    here we will focus on a class of percolation models , called enhancement percolation , introduced in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "enhancement percolation configurations are obtained by modifying , according to some local set of rules , the configurations generated by an independent ( bernoulli ) percolation process .",
    "other dependent percolation models obtained in a similar way arise naturally in different contexts such as the nonequilibrium dynamics of stochastic ising models at zero temperature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and cellular automata like bootstrap percolation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the enhancements that we are interested in are endowed with a natural monotonicity property and are such that they do not change the nature of the phase transition and do not shift the critical point @xmath0 , therefore transforming an independent critical percolation model into a different , but still critical , dependent percolation model . however ,",
    "even an enhancement that does not shift @xmath0 can modify significantly the initial percolation process , and it could a priori induce `` macroscopic '' changes ; it is therefore natural to ask whether such an enhancement can change the continuum scaling limit and the critical exponents .",
    "we show that this is not the case for the class of enhancements studied here .",
    "the result is not surprising , if seen in the context of the renormalization group picture which suggests that , as long as the enhancement has finite range , it should not affect the scaling limit and the critical exponents ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the renormalization group picture remains largely nonrigorous and no general formalism has been developed so far to put it on more solid ground .",
    "moreover , as the eight - vertex model  @xcite and some spin models  @xcite show , the concept of universality needs to be taken with some care .",
    "universality results in the same spirit as those presented in this paper can be found in  @xcite ( in  @xcite , universality for critical exponents is tested numerically ) . generally speaking , one way to look at these results",
    "is as an attempt to test the `` robustness '' of the scaling limit and critical exponents , as well as to give examples of a strong form of universality by constructing different ( dependent ) percolation models with the same critical exponents and scaling limit as independent percolation .",
    "the percolation models considered in  @xcite ( and in  @xcite ) are generated by applying certain cellular automata to independent percolation configurations . in those cases , the initial percolation configurations and the rules of the cellular automata",
    "possess a global  spin - flip \" symmetry .",
    "the situation in  @xcite and in this paper is different because the dynamics ( or the enhancement ) breaks the global  spin - flip \" symmetry .",
    "a key tool in proving the universality results is a coupling between the independent percolation process ( before the enhancement ) and the enhanced one , which allows to compare the two processes .",
    "this method does not apply directly to essential enhancements that do shift the critical point ( because in that case , if one starts at the critical point , the enhanced process is supercritical ) .",
    "that situation is very interesting and deserves to be studied , but unfortunately the methods used in this paper do not seem to be useful there .    before addressing the universality issue , we present a new result about two - dimensional enhancements endowed with a natural monotonicity property .",
    "this complements one of the main results of  @xcite , where it is proved that certain enhancements , called essential , always shift the critical point @xmath0 .",
    "we show that a two - dimensional , monotonic enhancement that is not essential can not produce an infinite cluster , and therefore leaves the critical point unchanged .",
    "in particular , this means that the monotonic , nonessential enhancement of a critical ( bernoulli ) percolation process is still critical , and that the phase transition in the enhanced model is still second order ( or continuous ) .",
    "this motivates the rest of the paper , since it identifies a class of critical , dependent percolation models for which it is natural to ask about critical exponents and scaling limits .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains a preview of some of the main universality results , in the context of site percolation on the triangular lattice .",
    "analogous universality results for the square and the hexagonal lattice are stated later on , in section  [ universality ] . before that",
    ", enhancement percolation is precisely defined and discussed in section  [ enhancement ] , where new results about monotonic enhancements in two dimensions are also presented .",
    "the last two sections are dedicated respectively to the proofs of the results on enhancement percolation ( section  [ proof - equivalence ] ) and of the universality results ( section  [ proofs ] ) .",
    "in this section , we present some of the main results of the paper . for a precise definition of enhancement percolation and more details , we refer to section  [ enhancement ] below .",
    "the universality results collected in this section are limited for simplicity to the case of the triangular lattice , where they can be stated unconditionally since the existence of ( certain ) critical exponents , of the scaling limit of crossing probabilities , and of the full scaling limit have been rigorously proved .",
    "later , in section  [ universality ] , we will state some results for the square and the hexagonal lattice , which will be however conditional on the existence of the critical exponents and the scaling limit for independent ( site ) percolation on those lattices .",
    "consider a dependent ( site ) percolation model on a regular lattice @xmath1 in which an initial configuration is generated by independent variables having density @xmath2 and then enhanced by means of a local function of the configuration . by regular lattices we mean the class of infinite graphs considered in  @xcite , but except for appendix  [ matching ] , for simplicity we will restrict our attention to the square , triangular and hexagonal lattice .",
    "the enhancement is stochastically activated at each site with probability @xmath3 , independently of the other sites , and its effect is to ( possibly ) make certain closed sites open .",
    "let @xmath4 be the percolation probability of the enhanced process , i.e. , the probability that the origin belongs to an infinite open cluster after the enhancement .    in this paper",
    ", we restrict our attention to a class of enhancements endowed with a natural _ monotonicity _ property , i.e. , we consider enhancement functions that are nondecreasing in the number of open sites ( see section  [ def+main - res ] for a precise definition ) . while we postpone the precise definitions to section  [ def+main - res ] , we give here a simple example . on a lattice @xmath1 of degree @xmath5 , consider an enhancement that , when activated at the origin , makes it open if at least @xmath6 of its neighbors are open .",
    "this can be considered the prototypical example of the type of finite - range , monotonic enhancements that we are interested in .",
    "all enhancements in this paper have finite - range in the sense that , as in the example above , the effect of the enhancement depends only on a bounded subset of the percolation configuration around the location where the enhancement is activated .",
    "the enhancement in the example is monotonic in the sense that making more sites open in the original percolation configuration can only produce more open sites , and never inhibits the enhancement .",
    "we remark that the restriction to monotonic enhancements is very natural , since if the enhancement is not monotonic , in general the percolation probability @xmath4 will not be monotonic in @xmath2 , and there could be ambiguity over the correct definition of the critical point ( i.e. , there could be more than one critical point  as an example , consider an enhancement of site percolation on the square lattice such that a closed site is made open only if all of its neighbors are closed ) .",
    "the following question motivates the rest of the paper . what happens to the phase transition when a monotonic enhancement is applied at @xmath0 ?",
    "with regard to this question , there could a priori be three types of monotonic enhancements : ( 1 ) enhancements that make the percolation process supercritical and therefore shift the critical point , ( 2 ) enhancements that do not make the process supercritical but change the universality class of the percolation model , ( 3 ) enhancements that do not make the process supercritical and do not change the universality class of the model . in",
    "what follows , we will essentially show that in two dimensions the second class of enhancements is empty .",
    "in other words , all two - dimensional dependent percolation models generated by a monotonic enhancement acting on independent ( bernoulli ) percolation and which does not shift the critical point are in the same universality class as independent percolation .    in dimension two , we also show ( see theorem  [ necess_and_suffic ] in section  [ def+main - res ] ) that the only monotonic enhancements that can shift the critical point are those that aizenman and grimmett  @xcite call _ essential _ ( see section  [ def+main - res ] for the definition ) .",
    "one of our universality results concerns four critical exponents , namely the exponents @xmath7 ( related to the percolation probability ) , @xmath8 ( related to the correlation length ) , @xmath9 ( related to the connectivity function ) and @xmath10 ( related to the mean cluster size ) .",
    "the existence of these exponents has been recently proved ( see  @xcite for the details ) , and their predicted values confirmed rigorously , for the case of independent site percolation on the triangular lattice @xmath11 .",
    "such exponents are believed to be universal for independent percolation on regular lattices in the sense that their value should depend only on the number of dimensions and not on the structure of the lattice or on the nature of the percolation model ( e.g. , whether it is site or bond percolation ) ; that type of universality has not yet been proved .",
    "consider an independent percolation model on a regular lattice @xmath1 with configurations chosen from a bernoulli product measure @xmath12 with density of open sites @xmath2 ( @xmath13 will denote expectation with respect to @xmath12 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is such that @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the open cluster containing the origin and @xmath16 its cardinality , then @xmath17 is the * percolation probability*. arguments from theoretical physics suggest that @xmath18 behaves roughly like @xmath19 as @xmath2 approaches @xmath0 from above .",
    "it is also believed that the * connectivity function * @xmath20 behaves , for large euclidean norm @xmath21 , like @xmath22 if @xmath23 , and like @xmath24 if @xmath25 , for some @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",

    "one way to go beyond crossing probabilities is by considering the law of the random interfaces , along the edges of the dual lattice @xmath42 , between open and closed clusters , as suggested by schramm  @xcite ( see figure  [ percolation ] in section  [ universality - scaling ] ) .",
