    "then , using the magorrian relation between black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity @xcite , they predicted an absolute magnitude of @xmath15 for the host galaxy .",
    "however , careful deconvolution of the hst images failed to detect a host galaxy associated with he0450@xmath02958 to a limit of @xmath16 ; five to sixteen times fainter than predicted .",
    "this intriguing result quickly revived the decade - old debate over the reality of _ naked _ quasars @xcite , leading to a flurry of theoretical papers describing various scenarios for ejecting black holes from their host galaxies during violent mergers @xcite , and the implications of such violent events for future gravity wave detectors @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite argued that he0450@xmath02958 s black hole mass could be an order of magnitude smaller , leading to a host galaxy luminosity of @xmath17 , and therefore quite consistent with the upper limit derived from the hst images .",
    "m05 attributed all of the fir emission to thermal radiating dust grains associated with the companion galaxy 7kpc from he0450@xmath02958 . however , there remains the possibility of a dusty ( optically obscured ) host galaxy associated with he0450@xmath02958 ) molecular disk fueling a spectacular , but heavily obscured , starburst @xcite . ] .",

    "the discrepancy between the vla and atca flux densities can be explained by the factor of seven difference in the spatial resolution between the two datasets , and immediately implies that 50% of the radio continuum emission at the position of the quasar is extended on spatial scales of greater than about 3kpc .",

    "is it dominated by agn - related emission ( core , jets , lobes , hotspots ) issuing out from the quasar itself ? or , given the large fir luminosity associated with the he0450@xmath02958 system , could the radio emission be energetically dominated by star formation activity from both the quasar s host galaxy and the nearby companion ? and , if the system is dominated by star formation , then what is the origin of the western radio component ( c3 ) , not associated with any optical counterpart ?    in  [ firrccor]-[vlbi ] , we will show that the he0450@xmath02958 system obeys the far - infrared to radio continuum correlation for normal ( i.e. non - agn ) galaxies , and that the quasar s radio emission has a steep spectral index and is resolved out in long - baseline interferometry data .",
    "together , these three conditions strongly favour the radio emission from the he0450@xmath02958 system being dominated by star formation activity .",
    "there is a very tight correlation between the far - infrared ( fir ) and radio continuum ( rc ) emission from normal ( ie .",
    "non - agn ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "while the actual mechanism driving the fir - rc correlation is still uncertain , this does not diminish the importance of the empirical relationship .",
    "it is generally accepted that the fundamental ingredient is star formation : the fir component is due to thermal radiation from dust grains which absorb the optical / far - uv starlight and re - radiate it in the infrared regime , whereas the radio continuum component arises from magnetic fields with synchrotron radiating relativistic electrons related to the star formation activity ( see also figure  [ yun2001figure5 ] ) .",
    "if the he0450@xmath02958 system obeys the fir - rc correlation , there is a good chance that most of its radio continuum emission is dominated by star formation processes , rather than more powerful agn emission from the central quasar . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sourcedes ] , due to the relatively low angular resolution of the existing ir observations ( from iras ) , it is currently not possible to separate the fir component associated with the quasar position from that associated with the neighbouring galaxy .",
    "however , we can constrain the nature of the quasar emission by measuring the location of the integrated quasar / galaxy system on the fir - rc correlation ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "we use the form of the fir - rc correlation derived from 1809 infrared selected galaxies from the iras 2jy catalogue2958 with an iras selected sample because he0450@xmath02958 was itself infrared selected . ] by ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is consistent  but at the lower limit  with the observed value of @xmath46 from equation  [ nvss ] with @xmath47)mjy from the nvss catalogue @xcite .",
    "the position of the integrated he0450@xmath02958 quasar / galaxy system on the fir - rc correlation for a subset of the most fir luminous galaxies from y01 is shown in figure  [ yun2001figure5 ] .",
    "( crosses ) and for he0450@xmath02958 ( triangle ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to the formal fit to the fir - rc correlation given in equation  [ firrc ] .",
    "the three sources lying well above the fir - rc correlation are examples of sources in the iras 2jy sample with an excess of radio continuum emission from an agn .",
    ", width=453 ]    [ yun2001figure6 ]    since 53% of the radio continuum emission from the he0450@xmath02958 system originates at the position of the quasar , and since the quasar / galaxy system obeys the fir - rc correlation , this suggests that approximately 53% of the fir emission arises at the quasar position , and is powered by star - forming activity from its surrounding host galaxy .",
    "this could explain why hst failed to detect the host galaxy : it is simply heavily obscured by the dust from a luminous ( @xmath48m@xmath10 ) infrared galaxy , with an implied star formation rate of order 50m@xmath14  year@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this seemingly large star formation rate is typical for locally observed luminous infrared galaxies @xcite and infrared bright quasars @xcite .    due to the small , but finite , dispersion in the fir - rc correlation , a scenario in which some fraction of the radio continuum emission from the he0450@xmath02958 system is due to agn activity is certainly possible ; it is not uncommon to find agn and star formation activity in the same system .",
    "however , agn emission can not be the dominant process contributing to the radio continuum emission of the he0450@xmath02958 .",
    "table  [ fluxes ] lists the values of @xmath49 for c1 ( quasar ) , c2 ( companion ) and c3 .",
    "a combination of low signal - to - noise and proximity of the two frequencies means that our estimates of @xmath49 for both c2 and c3 have large associated uncertainties .",
    "however , we have measured @xmath50 for c1 ( the quasar ) , which does rule out a flat - spectrum agn component ( typically the radio continuum emission from a compact agn core is flatter than @xmath51 ) .",
    "the observed spectral index is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission either from star formation or extended low - luminosity agn structures like compact steep - spectrum jets and/or lobes .",
    "steep radio spectral indices are typical of the cores of seyfert galaxies ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "he0450@xmath02958 was included in a sample of seyfert galaxies observed with the now defunct 275 km single baseline parkes - tidbinbilla real - time interferometer ( pti ; norris et al .",
    "1988 , roy et al .",
    "1994 ) . at 2300mhz ,",
    "the pti was only sensitive to structures smaller than 0.1@xmath5 , and therefore perfectly suited to probe compact radio continuum emission from the nucleus of seyferts and quasars .",
    "he0450@xmath02958 was observed with the pti ( two snapshots of the _ uv_-plane ) in 1987 , 1990 and 1991 @xcite .",
    "the quasar was _ not _ detected down to @xmath52mjy at 2300mhz . using the observed radio spectral index of @xmath53 ( see  [ results ] ) , this means that @xmath540.6mjy of the radio continuum emission at 6208mhz is contaminated by an agn core ; this upper limit is a factor of three smaller than the total radio continuum emission observed from c1 .",
    "the lack of compact radio continuum emission down to these limits implies that c1 is resolved on scales of @xmath55pc .",
    "coupled to the good fit to the fir - rc correlation (  [ firrc ] ) these long baseline constraints also support a star formation origin for the bulk of the quasar s radio continuum emission , arising from its underlying host galaxy .",
    "the bulk of the radio continuum emission from the he0450@xmath02958 system arises from star formation activity at the position of the quasar ( c1 ) and the companion galaxy ( c2 ) .",
    "this in itself is an interesting result : _ it is direct evidence for a host galaxy associated with the quasar_. however , the atca radio images ( confirmed by the vla archive images ) show an asymetric , almost - linear , triple radio structure with a projected size of @xmath220kpc .",
    "although c1 and c2 can both be identified with optical counterparts , and therefore understood in terms of star formation , c2 is not perfectly coincident with the companion galaxy , and c3 has no associated optical counterpart .",
    "a full description of the he0450@xmath02958 system must include c3 and an explanation for the slight offset between c2 and the companion , so there is something plainly missing from the pure star formation interpretation .",
    "the linearity of the three radio components suggests the presence of low - luminosity jets similar to those observed in seyfert galaxies , or radio - quiet quasars . in this case , the agn core is centred on c1 ( the quasar ) , and c2 and c3 would be low - luminosity radio lobes , or poorly resolved jets .    in  [ firrccor ]",
    ", we mentioned that whilst the total radio continuum emission is dominated by star formation , the system would still obey the fir - rc correlation if a fraction was due to agn processes .",
    "the integrated radio continuum emission of the system is 3.4mjy at 6208mhz . at this frequency",
    ", c3 is associated with 0.4mjy of flux density which we now attribute to the western radio lobe .",
    "we associate an equal contribution of 0.4mjy to lobe emission at c2 .",
    "in addition , a maximum 0.6mjy can be associated with agn core emission from c1 ( see  [ vlbi ] ) . in total , up to 41% of the total radio continuum emission from the system can be attributed to an agn contribution .",
    "this maximum estimate translates into a 1400mhz radio luminosity of order @xmath56whz , typical of low - luminosity seyfert or fri radio sources .",
    "we have reanalysed the vlt spectroscopic data presented in several previously published papers ( m05 , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ 2dspec ] shows the 2d spectra around the ] @xmath575007  lines , where the point sources ( star and quasar ) have been subtracted from the original spectra and then artificially added with an increased resolution at the appropriate position ; this was done to disentangle the various diffuse components . as expected , the star , galaxy and quasar all show continuum emission . however , there are also at least three separate emission line regions with no detectable continuum : one between the quasar and galaxy ( labelled _ emission 1 _ in figure  [ 2dspec ] ) , one between the star and the quasar ( _ emission 2 _ ) , and a high surface brightness region ( the blob ) about 0.5@xmath5 west of the quasar . _",
    "emission 1 _ and the blob are both detected in the hst optical image shown in figure  [ hstimage ] , but _ emission 2 _ is not detected presumably due to the acs sensitivity ( letawe , private communication ) .",
    "velocity structure is quite evident in the spectral profile of _ emission 1_. extended emission line regions are typically found aligned along the radio axes of powerful radio galaxies @xcite . in many cases",
    "there is very good evidence that the alignment is caused by the interaction of the radio jets with gas clouds in the interstellar medium ; the jets shock - ionise the clouds along their path ( e.g. @xcite ) and in some cases induce gravitational cloud collapse , which can trigger star formation @xcite . in other cases , the emission line regions are dominated by photoionisation by the agn ( illumination ) .",
    "no doubt it is often a combination of all of these that produce the alignment effects we observe .    in figure  [ diagnostic ] , a bpt @xcite diagnostic diagram has been constructed showing the ] @xmath575007/h@xmath58  versus ] @xmath573727/]@xmath575007  line ratios for the various emission line regions shown in figure  [ 2dspec ] .",

    "clearly the blob , and regions 1 and 2 from figure  [ 2dspec ] are being ionised by agn activity and not star formation . however , it is notoriously difficult to use diagnostic diagrams to actually separate agn illumination from ionisation by radiative shocks from agn jets @xcite , because they occupy a similar parameter space in the diagrams ( see @xcite for recent some diagnostic diagrams of the extended emission line regions around radio galaxies ) .",
    "we are , therefore , unable to confidently distinguish between the agn illumination and shock ionisation based on the diagnostic plot alone .",
    "however , given the good spatial coincidence between the radio structure and the emission line clouds , we favour the _ shock+precursor _ ionisation scenario triggered by jet - cloud interactions @xcite .",
    "higher resolution radio images , along with optical integral field spectroscopy would be an excellent way to to explore the spatial distribution of the jets / lobes with the emission line gas in more detail in order to confidently determine the origin of the radio - optical alignment effect in the he0450@xmath02958 system .",

    "<S> a re - anlaysis of the vlt spectroscopic data shows extended emission line regions aligned with the radio axis and extended on scales of @xmath220kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as evidence for jet - cloud interactions , similar to those observed in radio galaxies and seyferts . </S>",
    "<S> the emission lines in the companion galaxy are consistent with radiative shocks and its spatial association with the eastern radio lobe implies large - scale jet - induced star formation has played a role in this galaxy s evolution . </S>"
