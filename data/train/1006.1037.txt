    "the hypercp experiment  @xcite has reported the observation of three events for @xmath10 decay .",
    "the dimuon masses of the observed events are clustered within the detector resolution of 1 mev/@xmath1 , around 214.3 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "these decays might be interpreted as a two - body decay , @xmath11 .",
    "the probability for all three events to be anywhere in kinematically allowed region within the detector resolution is less than 1% within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an existence of a new particle with such a low mass would be a signal for a new physics beyond the sm .",
    "there are particularly intriguing interpretations for the @xmath4 ; a pseudoscalar sgoldstino particle  @xcite in various supersymmetric models  @xcite , a light pseudoscalar higgs boson  @xcite in the next - to - minimal - supersymmetric standard model as well as a vector @xmath12-boson  @xcite .",
    "the result of model independent study for a spin-1 @xmath4 particle is also available in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the estimated branching fractions for @xmath13 where @xmath4 is a sgoldstino particle and @xmath14 is either a @xmath15 or @xmath16 mesons , are in the range @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "we report on a search for @xmath4 decaying to dimuon with the decay modes , @xmath19 and @xmath20 using a data sample of @xmath21 pairs collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath22 collider  @xcite .",
    "the kek b - factory , kekb , is an asymmetric @xmath9 collider operating at the @xmath23(4s ) .",
    "beam energies are 3.5 gev for low energy ring ( ler , @xmath24 ) and 8 gev for high energy ring ( her , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the beams collide at a single interaction point with a crossing angle of @xmath511 mrad .",
    "the mass of the @xmath23(4s ) is just above the threshold of @xmath26 production and exclusively decays to @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath29 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the muon detection efficiency and fake rate of klm are better than 90% and less than 5% , respectively .",
    "in this search , we assume that the light @xmath4 particle is a scalar particle and decays to dimuon immediately with @xmath30 . unless specified otherwise , charge - conjugate modes are implied .",
    "the term scalar @xmath4 particle implies either a scalar or pseudoscalar particle throughout this proceeding ..    the reconstruction of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) decay uses identified @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath33 ) tracks .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) candidate is required to be within @xmath51.5@xmath34 ( @xmath51.0@xmath34 ) of the central value .",
    "the @xmath35 tracks are used to reconstruct @xmath4 candidates .",
    "@xmath36 candidates are reconstructed from a @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) candidate and a @xmath35 pair .",
    "reconstructed @xmath36 candidates are selected using kinematic variables , such as the beam energy - constrained mass @xmath37 and energy difference @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined as follows ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the beam energy and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are the energy ( momentum ) of the reconstructed @xmath44 candidates evaluated in the center - of - mass frame . in the events containing more than one @xmath36 candidate",
    ", we select a @xmath36 candidate having the smallest @xmath45 value , where the @xmath45 value is calculated by one - vertex constrained fit using four charged tracks in the candidates .",
    "the signal region for dimuon mass of hypercp event search is defined to be 211.6 mev/@xmath1 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath46 217.2 mev/@xmath1 by considering the uncertainties in @xmath4 mass measurement of the hypercp and belle detector resolutions .",
    "the signal efficiency is estimated by accepted events in the @xmath4 mass window for the selected events in the @xmath38 - @xmath48 signal region for each mode .    for background studies , monte",
    "carlo ( mc ) samples which are three times larger than the data sample are used .",
    "the mc sample is fitted with a probability density function , @xmath49 for @xmath50 @xmath51 2@xmath52 , where @xmath50 is a dimuon mass in gev/@xmath1 , @xmath52 is the muon mass and the parameter @xmath53 is extracted from the fit at sideband region .",

    "the estimated backgrounds for the hypercp event search are 0.13@xmath58 and 0.11@xmath59 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .    before examining the all data sample ,",
    "we compare various distributions such as @xmath48 , @xmath38 , dimuon mass , and etc . with a part of the mc and data samples .",

    "the total systematic uncertainties in the upper limits for the decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 are 5.2% and 5.7% , respectively .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainties come from tracking efficiency and muon identification .",
    "the uncertainty for the tracking efficiency is estimated by linearly summing the single track systematic errors which are about 1%/track . the systematic for the muon identification",
