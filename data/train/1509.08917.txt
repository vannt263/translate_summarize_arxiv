    "one of the first systematic chemical analysis of agb stars in gcs has been performed in m5 by @xcite , who found a significant discrepancy between the iron abundance derived from neutral and from single - ionized lines , in the sense of systematically lower values of [ fei / h ] , with respect to [ feii / h ] .",
    "very similar results , with differences up to @xmath2 dex , have been recently found in a sample of agb stars in 47 tucanae ( 47tuc ) and ngc 3201 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) . in all cases , the discrepancy can not be explained by measurement uncertainties or an incorrect derivation of the atmospheric parameters , and it is not observed in red giant branch ( rgb ) stars belonging to the same cluster and analyzed in a homogeneous way .",
    "a proposed explanation is that agb stars suffer from departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions , driven by iron over - ionization , in their atmospheres .",
    "in fact , this is expected to mainly affect ( weaken ) the neutral lines , while leaving unaltered the ionized features of the same chemical species ( see @xcite ) . following @xcite , important nlte effects",
    "are indeed expected in metal - poor stars with low values of gravity , mainly comparable to those typically observed near the rgb - tip of gcs , and they should decrease for increasing metallicity . however , most of the giants studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are much fainter than the rgb - tip , and 47tuc is one of the most metal - rich gcs ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ; @xcite ) . moreover , the available nlte corrections are essentially the same for stars with similar atmospheric parameters and can not therefore explain why such a discrepancy is observed for agb stars only and not even in all of them .",
    "indeed , more recent results obtained in the metal - poor gc m22 show that also some rgb stars have fei abundances significantly lower than those determined from ionized lines @xcite , thus adding further complexity to this puzzling situation .    in order to help understanding the origin and the magnitude of these effects , detailed chemical analyses of giant stars in gcs with different metallicities and different properties are crucial . in this work",

    "the spectra have been acquired by using the grating 580 red arm cd#3 , which provides a high spectral resolution ( r@xmath640000 ) and a spectral coverage between 4800 and @xmath7 .",
    "the 19 targets have been sampled by means of four different fiber configurations , in five pointings of 30 min each ( one configuration has been repeated twice ) , during the nights of 2014 , april 16 and june 2 , 3 and 19 . in each configuration , one or two fibers have been used to sample the sky for background subtraction purposes . after careful visual inspection , only the ( 19 ) spectra with a signal - to - noise larger than 50 have been kept in the analysis .",
    "the spectra have been reduced by using the dedicated eso pipeline performing bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , spectral extraction and order merging .",
    "the sky background has been subtracted from each individual spectrum .",
    "the target stars have been selected from the photometric catalog of @xcite , obtained from hst - wfpc2 observations .",
    "only stars brighter than @xmath8 and sufficiently isolated ( i.e. , with no stellar sources of comparable or larger luminosity within a distance of @xmath9 , and with no fainter stars within @xmath10 ) have been selected .",
    "figure [ cmd ] shows the @xmath11 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) corrected for differential reddening following the procedure described in @xcite and adopting the extinction law by @xcite .",
    "the final sample includes 6 agb and 13 rgb stars .",
    "all the target stars are located within @xmath685@xmath12 from the cluster center .",
    "their identification number , coordinates , and magnitudes are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the radial velocities of our targets have been obtained by using the code daospec @xcite and by measuring the position of over 300 metallic lines distributed along the whole spectral range covered by the 580 red arm of uves - flames .",
    "the uncertainties have been computed as the dispersion of the velocities measured from each line divided by the square root of the number of lines used , and they turned out to be smaller than 0.05 km s@xmath13 .",
    "finally , we applied the heliocentric corrections computed with the iraf task rvcorrect . for each spectrum ,",

    "the most discrepant target ( id=79 ) , with a radial velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath13 , is still within 2@xmath23 from the systemic velocity of the cluster . by using the besanon galactic model @xcite , we extracted a sample of about 5300 field stars in the direction of m62 , finding a quite broad and asymmetric radial velocity distribution , with mean @xmath24 km s@xmath13 and dispersion @xmath25 km s@xmath13 , which partially overlaps with that of the cluster . on the other hand ,",

    "thus , taking into account the metallicity of star 79 ( see below ) , its position in the cmd , and its distance from the cluster center ( @xmath27 ) , we conclude that it is likely a genuine cluster member and we therefore keep it in the following analysis .",
    "first guess effective temperature ( @xmath28 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath29 ) values for each target have been derived by using the photometric information .",
    "temperatures have been estimated by using the @xmath30 calibration of @xcite .",
    "gravities have been computed with the stefan - boltzmann equation by adopting the color excess quoted above , a distance modulus @xmath31 mag @xcite and the bolometric correction from @xcite . for the rgb stars we adopted a mass of 0.82 @xmath32 , according to the best fit isochrone retrieved from the parsec dataset @xcite , and computed for an age of 12 gyr and a metallicity z=0.0013 . for the agb stars we adopted a mass of 0.61 @xmath32 , according to the median value of the horizontal branch ( hb ) mass range estimated by @xcite .",
    "then we have performed a spectroscopic analysis as done in @xcite and @xcite , constraining the atmospheric parameters as follows : ( 1 ) spectroscopic temperatures have been obtained by requiring that no trend exists between iron abundance and excitation potential , ( 2 ) the gravity was derived by using the stefan - boltzmann equation with the value of @xmath28 thus obtained and ( 3 ) the microturbulent velocity was determined by requiring that no trend exists between iron abundance and line strength . in order to evaluate the effects of a different procedure in the derivation of the atmospheric parameters and abundances",

    "the model atmospheres have been computed with the atlas9 code .",
    "we adopted the atomic and molecular data from the last release of the kurucz / castelli compilation and selected only the lines predicted to be unblended .",
    "the selected lines and the atomic data adopted in the analysis are listed in table [ tab2 ] .    as detailed in table [ tab3 ] , we used 100 - 150 fei lines and 7 - 12 feii lines to derive the iron abundances , 25 - 60 lines of tii and 6 - 15 lines of tiii to derive the abundances of titanium . for nai ,",
    "mgi and ali only few lines are available , namely those at 5682 - 5688@xmath33 and 6154 - 6160@xmath33 for nai , the line at 5711@xmath33 and the doublet at 6318 - 6319@xmath33 for mgi , and the doublet at 6696 - 6698@xmath33 for ali .",
    "the o abundances have been derived from spectral synthesis in order to take into account the blending between the forbidden [ oi ] line at 6300.3@xmath33 and a ni transition .",
    "for the ni we adopted the average abundance obtained by @xcite , while for stars located in the upper - rgb we assumed average c and n abundances according to @xcite , all rescaled to the assumed solar reference values @xcite .",
    "because in some spectra the [ oi ] line was partially blended also with a telluric line , the spectra have been cleaned by using suitable synthetic spectra obtained with the tapas tool @xcite .",
    "for some stars , the [ oi ] line is not detectable , thus only upper limits are obtained . as solar reference abundances we adopted the @xcite value for o , and those of @xcite for all the other elements .    for the computation of the global uncertainties on the final abundances we took into account two main sources of errors , which have been added in quadrature :    * the error arising from the ew measurements . for each star we computed this term by dividing the line - to - line dispersion by the square root of the number of lines used .",
    "thanks to the high - quality of the spectra and to the number of lines that can be exploited , this term turned out to be very small , especially for fei and tii ( providing up to 150 lines ) . for these species",
    "the line - to - line scatter is smaller than 0.1 dex , leading to internal uncertainties lower than 0.01 - 0.02 dex . for feii and tiii the number of lines ranges from 7 up to 15 , leading to an uncertainty of about 0.02 - 0.03 dex . for the other chemical species",
    "the number of measured lines is much smaller ( 1 - 4 ) .",
    "hence , the average uncertainties are of the order of 0.06 - 0.08 dex for oi , nai , mgi and ali . *",
    "the error arising from atmospheric parameters .",
    "for the computation of this term we varied each parameter by the @xmath34 error obtained from the previous analysis .",
    "we have found that representative errors for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 k , @xmath37 dex and @xmath37 km s@xmath13 , respectively , for both the rgb and the agb samples .",
    "thus we decided to adopt these values as @xmath34 error for all stars .",
    "we also checked the effect of a @xmath38 dex change in the metallicity of the model atmosphere , finding variations smaller than @xmath39 dex on the final abundances .",
    "the determination of abundances and abundance ratios of the various chemical elements is described below .",
    "the adopted atmospheric parameters and the measured iron and titanium abundances for the observed rgb and agb stars are listed in table [ tab3 ] , while the abundances of the light - elements are listed in table [ tab4 ] . in table",
    "[ tab5 ] we present the global abundance uncertainty of one rgb and one agb star , as well as the uncertainties obtained by varying each atmospheric parameter independently .",
    "since this approach does not take into account the correlations among different parameters , the global error can be slightly overestimated .    since star 96 presents an anomalous behavior with respect to the other agb targets , in the following analysis it is not included in the agb sample ( thus counting five stars ) , and it is discussed separately at the end of section [ sec : feti ] .      by using spectroscopic gravities ( thus imposing that the same iron abundance is obtained from neutral and from single - ionized lines ) , the average values measured for the rgb and the agb sub - samples are [ fe / h]@xmath40 ( @xmath41 dex ) and [ fe / h]@xmath42 ( @xmath43 dex ) .",
    "these values are consistent ( within 1 - 2 @xmath23 ) with previous abundance determinations of m62 giants , regardless they are on the rgb or on the agb : [ fe / h]@xmath44 dex @xcite , [ fe / h ] = @xmath45 dex @xcite , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath46 dex ( @xmath47 dex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by using photometric gravities ( and not imposing ionization balance",
    ") , we determined the iron abundances separately from neutral and from single - ionized lines . for the 13 rgb stars we obtained [ fei / h]@xmath48 dex ( @xmath41 dex ) and [ feii / h]@xmath49 dex ( @xmath50 dex ) . for the 5 agb stars we measured [ fei / h]@xmath51 dex ( @xmath52 dex ) and [ feii / h]@xmath53 dex ( @xmath54 dex ) .",
    "the average difference between the values of @xmath29 derived spectroscopically and those derived photometrically are 0.09 dex ( @xmath55 dex ) and 0.30 dex ( @xmath56 dex ) for the rgb and the agb samples , respectively .",
    "figure [ genhist ] shows the generalized histograms of the iron abundances for the rgb and the agb samples separately , obtained by using spectroscopic ( left panels ) and photometric gravities ( right panels ) . by construction",
    ", the distributions of [ fei / h ] and [ feii / h ] essentially coincide if spectroscopic gravities are assumed .",
    "instead , the two distributions significantly differ in the case of agb stars if photometric gravities are adopted .",
    "in particular , the average iron abundances of rgb stars measured from neutral and single - ionized lines are consistent within the uncertainties , while a difference of @xmath57 dex , exceeding 5@xmath23 , is found for the agb sample .",
    "moreover , rgb and agb stars show very similar ( well within 1@xmath23 ) average values of [ feii / h ] , while the neutral abundances of agb stars are significantly lower ( by @xmath58 dex ) than those of the rgb targets .",
    "when using photometric gravities similar results are obtained for titanium , the only other chemical species presenting a large number of neutral and single - ionized lines . for the rgb sample",
    "we find [ tii / h]@xmath59 dex ( @xmath50 dex ) and [ tiii / h]@xmath60 dex ( @xmath47 dex ) . for the agb stars we measure [ tii / h]@xmath61 dex ( @xmath62 dex ) and [ tiii / h]@xmath63 dex ( @xmath50 dex ) .",
    "in this case , the average abundance of agb stars from neutral lines is lower than that of the rgb sample by 0.21 dex ( while such a difference amounts to only 0.04 dex for the rgb sample ) . in figure [ feti ]",
    "we report the differences between the iron ( top left panel ) and the titanium ( top right panel ) abundances derived from neutral and from single - ionized lines , as a function of the abundances from the neutral species , obtained for each observed star assuming photometric gravities .",
    "clearly , with the only exception of star 96 ( plotted as an empty circle in the figure ) , the agb and the rgb samples occupy distinct regions in these planes , because of systematically lower values of the agb abundances derived from the neutral species .",
    "such a difference can be also directly appreciated by visually inspecting the line strengths in the observed spectra and their synthetic best - fits .",
    "as an example , in figure [ spec ] we show the observed spectra of an rgb and an agb star around some fei and feii lines , together with synthetic spectra calculated with the appropriate atmospheric parameters and the metallicity derived from feii and from fei lines . as apparent ,",
    "the synthetic spectrum computed adopting the feii abundance well reproduces all the observed lines in the case of the rgb star , while it fails to fit the neutral features observed in the agb target , independently of the excitation potential ( thus guaranteeing that the effect can not be due to inadequacies in the adopted temperature ) . on the other hand , the abundance measured from fei lines is too low to properly reproduce the depth of the ionized features of the agb star .",
    "this clearly demonstrates a different behaviour of iron lines in agb and rgb stars .",
    "to investigate the origin of the discrepancy between fei and feii abundances obtained for the agb sample , we checked the impact of the adopted stellar mass on the estimate of the photometric gravity . as described in sect .",
    "[ atmos ] , for the agb stars we assumed a mass of @xmath64 , corresponding to the median value of the distribution obtained for hb stars by @xcite , ranging from 0.51 to 0.67@xmath32 . by adopting the lowest mass ( 0.51@xmath32 ) ,",
    "the average value of @xmath29 decreases by @xmath65 dex , while assuming the largest value , @xmath29 increases by @xmath66 dex .",
    "such small gravity variations is essentially the same ( @xmath67 dex ) even if the mass provided by the best - fit isochrone ( @xmath68 ) is adopted .",
    "] have a negligible impact on the abundances derived from the neutral iron lines , and the impact is still modest ( at a level of a few hundredths of a dex ) on the abundances derived from single - ionized lines . the only way to obtain ( by construction ) the same abundance from fei and feii lines is to use the spectroscopic values of @xmath29 derived from the ionization balance ( sect .",
    "[ atmos ] ) .",
    "however , these gravities correspond to stellar masses in the range 0.25 - 0.3 @xmath69 , which are totally unphysical for evolved stars in gcs .    a possible explanation of the observed discrepancy could be a departure from lte condition in the atmosphere of agb stars .",
    "in fact , lines originated by atoms in the minority ionization state usually suffer from nlte effects , while those originated by atoms in the dominant ionization state are unaffected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if this is the case , the most reliable determination of the iron abundance is that provided by [ feii / h ] , since the majority of iron atoms is in the first ionized state in giant stars .",
    "moreover , following @xcite , the degree of overionization of the neutral species should be ( at least at a first order ) the same as the one affecting fei lines .",
    "hence , the correct way to obtain a [ x / fe ] abundance ratio is to compute it with respect to the fei abundance if [ x / h ] is derived from minority species , and with respect to feii if [ x / h ] is obtained from majority species . in the lower panels of figure [ feti ] we present the [ tiii / feii ] and the [ tii / fei ] abundance ratios as a function of the iron abundance derived from single - ionized lines .",
    "as expected , the abundances of agb stars agree with those of the rgb sample when single ionized ( dominant state ) titanium lines are used . for [ tii / fei ]",
    "a systematic offset of the agb sample toward lower values is still observable ( although reduced ) , thus indicating the possible presence of residual nlte effects .",
    "we also note a systematic offset of + 0.08 dex between [ tii / fei ] and [ tiii / feii ] , especially for rgb stars .",
    "however , taking into account that the oscillator strength values of the tiii lines are highly uncertain and that the offset is still reasonably small , we can conclude that the [ x / fe ] abundance ratio can be safely constrained either by neutral or by single - ionized lines .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the average [ tii / fe ] and [ tiii / fe ] abundance ratios ( + 0.16 dex and + 0.25 dex , respectively ) of @xcite show a relative offset of @xmath70 dex , which is similar to ours but in the opposite direction .",
    "this suggests that there is an intrinsic ( although small ) uncertainty in the zero point scale of the titanium abundance .",
    "_ agb star 96  _ as apparent from fig .",
    "[ feti ] , agb star 96 shows a difference between neutral and ionized abundances , both for iron and titanium , which is incompatible with those found for the other agb targets , and which is much more similar to the values measured for rgb stars .",
    "interestingly , star 96 presents atmospheric parameters compatible with those spanned by the rgb targets ( but with a surface gravity which is 0.15 - 0.2 lower than that of rgb stars at the same temperature ) .",
    "this case is similar to that encountered in 47tuc , where the fei abundance of a small sub - sample of agb stars ( 4 out of 24 ) has been found to agree with the value obtained from ionized lines , thus suggesting that one of the possible explanations could be the lack of lte departures for these objects @xcite .",
    "also in m22 , one ( out of five ) agb star shows a perfect agreement between [ fei / h ] and [ feii / h ] , while the other agb stars show systematically low [ fei / h ] values @xcite .      in most galactic gcs ,",
    "the abundances of oxygen , sodium , magnesium and aluminium are known to show large star - to - star variations , organized in clear correlations ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these are usually interpreted as the signature of self - enrichment processes occurring in the early stages of gc evolution and giving rise to at least two stellar generations with a very small ( if any ) age difference , commonly labelled as first and second generations ( fg and sg , respectively ) . in particular ,",
    "the variations observed in o , na , mg and al are thought to be due to the ejecta from still unclear polluters , like massive agb stars , fast - rotating massive stars and/or massive binaries @xcite .    to verify the presence of these key features also in our sample of giants",
    ", we derived the abundances of o , na , al , and mg from the observed spectra .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ light ] , where all abundance ratios are plotted as a function of the iron content as measured from the ionized lines .",
    "since the oxygen abundance derived from the forbidden [ oi ] line at 6300.3 @xmath33 is not affected by nlte , its abundance ratio is expressed with respect to the `` true '' iron content ( measured from feii lines ) . instead",
    ", the other species are known to suffer from nlte effects and their abundances are therefore plotted with respect to fei ( see section [ sec : feti ] ) .",

    "as shown in figures [ ona ] and [ al ] , the observed star - to - star variations are organized in the same correlations observed for gcs . in particular ,",
    "oxygen and sodium are anti - correlated , independently of using fei or feii for the computation of the sodium abundance ratio ( fig .",
    "[ ona ] ) , while aluminum and sodium are positively correlated and [ ali / fei ] shows a @xmath71 dex spread for fixed magnesium ( fig .",
    "very interestingly , instead , all abundance ratios are constant for the agb sample , with values mainly consistent with those commonly associated to the fg .",
    "the na - o anti - correlation derived from our rgb sample is qualitatively compatible with that measured by @xcite , who found two groups of stars well - separated both in [ na / fe ] and [ o / fe ] .",
    "we note that the oxygen abundances quoted by @xcite are larger than ours , with an average offset of + 0.5 dex for the o - rich stars .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy can be ascribable to different factors ( like atomic data , telluric correction , etc . ) , but it is beyond the aims of this paper . a good agreement with the results of @xcite",

    "the derived na - o anti - correlation of m62 is more extended than those observed in most galactic gcs .",

    "the differences in the iron and titanium abundances measured from neutral and from single - ionized lines in five agb stars of m62 closely resemble those found in m5 @xcite , 47tuc @xcite and ngc 3201 @xcite .",
    "these results might be explained as the consequences of departures from lte conditions , affecting the neutral species , while leaving unaltered the ionized lines .",
    "the final effect is a systematic underestimate of the chemical abundances if measured from neutral features .",
    "interestingly , the findings in m5 , 47tuc and ngc 3201 seem to suggest that this effect concerns most , but not all , agb stars , while it is essentially negligible for rgb targets .",
    "this is inconsistent with the available nlte calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which predict the same corrections for stars with similar parameters .",
    "moreover , the results recently obtained in m22 show that the situation is even more complex . in m22 , in fact",
    ", neutral iron abundances systematically lower than [ feii / h ] have been measured also for rgb stars @xcite .",
    "however , the [ fei / h]-[feii / h ] difference in m22 clearly correlates with the abundance of s - process elements ( that show intrinsic star - to - star variations unusual for gcs ) , suggesting that this could be a distinct , peculiar case .",
    "all these results seem to suggest that we are still missing some crucial detail about the behaviour of chemical abundances in the case of departures from lte conditions , and/or that other ingredients ( as full 3d , spherical hydro calculations , and the inclusion of chromospheric components ) should be properly taken into account in modeling the atmospheres of these stars .    for all the studied stars we have also determined the abundances of o , na , al and mg from the neutral lines available . as shown in figs .",
    "[ ona ] and",
    "[ al ] , our sample of rgb stars shows the typical behaviors observed in all massive gcs , with large and mutually correlated dispersions of o , na and al ( and with one of the most na - rich giant ever observed in a gc : rgb star 89 , with [ na / fe]=@xmath74 dex ) . instead",
    ", the light - element abundances of agb stars are essentially constant and clumped at the low - end of the na and al values of the rgb sample .",
    "if the ( still unclear ) nlte effects impacting the fei and tii abundances of the agb targets significantly weaken the minority species lines ( as it seems reasonable to assume ) , also the measured abundances of sodium , aluminum and magnesium could be underestimated for these objects ( even when referred to the neutral iron abundance , fei ) .",
    "thus , although the observed star - to - star variation of na in most gcs is often a factor of 5 - 10 larger than the suspected nlte effects on fe and ti , we caution that it could be risky to derive firm conclusions about a lack of na - rich agb stars on the basis of the sodium abundance alone until these effects are properly understood and quantified ( of course , the same holds for any other light - element potentially affected by nlte effects , especially if the star - to - star variations of this element are intrinsically small ) .",
    "in fact , a lack of na - rich agb stars could be either real , or just due to a bias induced by nlte effects .",
    "a solid evidence , instead , is obtained if the result is based on elemental species ( like the oxygen abundance derived from the forbidden line considered here ) that are virtually unaffected by nlte effects .",
    "hence , fig .",
    "[ ona ] , showing that the oxygen abundances of all agb stars are larger than those expected for the sg population and measured , in fact , for a sub - sample of rgb giants , convincingly indicates that none of the agb targets studied in m62 is compatible with the sg of the cluster .",
    "does this mean that the sg stars in m62 did not experience the agb phase ( as it has been suggested for ngc6752 by @xcite ) ? to answer this question we note that , although variable from cluster to cluster , the typical percentages of fg and sg stars in galactic gcs are 30% and 70% , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on this basis , we should have observed 4 second generation agb stars in our sample . in alternative , from figs .",
    "[ ona ] and",
    "[ al ] we see that 6 out of 13 ( 46% ) rgb stars likely belong to the sg and , we could have therefore expected 2 - 3 agb stars in the same group , at odds with what observed . on the other hand , a deficiency of cn - strong ( second generation ) agb stars in several gcs is known since the pioneering work of @xcite and it has been recently found to be most severe in gcs with the bluest hb morphology ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "while m62 has indeed a very extended hb , it shows no deficiency of agb stars .",
    "in fact , by using acs and wfc3 hst archive data acquired in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 filters , we counted the number of agb and hb stars ( 86 and 640 , respectively ) in m62 , finding that their ratio ( the so - called @xmath77 parameter ; @xcite ) is @xmath78 .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the ratio between the agb and the hb evolutionary timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , our observations show that all the sampled agb stars belong to the fg , but we can not exclude that some sg object is present along the agb of m62 .",
    "clearly , if a complete lack of sg agb stars is confirmed by future studies in m62 , ngc 6752 , m13 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or any other gc , this will represent a new challenge for the formation and evolution models of these stellar systems ( as already discussed , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this research is part of the project cosmic - lab ( see http://www.cosmic-lab.eu ) funded by the european research council ( under contract erc-2010-adg-267675 ) .",

    "<S> the rgb stars show the typical correlations observed for globular cluster stars . </S>",
    "<S> instead , all the agb targets are clumped in the regions where first generation stars are expected to lie , similarly to what recently found for the agb population of ngc6752 . while the sodium and aluminum abundance could be underestimated as a consequence of the nlte bias affecting iron and titanium , the used oxygen line does not suffer from the same effects and the lack of o - poor agb stars therefore is solid . we can thus conclude that none of the investigated agb stars belong to the second stellar generation of m62 . we also find a rgb star with extremely high sodium abundance ( [ na / fe]@xmath0 dex ) . </S>"
