    "so , is the hercules stream a distinct stellar population with a unique origin and evolutionary history , or is it a mixture of different populations ?    using available data in the literature @xcite found that most hercules stars tend to follow the thin disk abundance trends .",
    "they , however , concluded that the existing knowledge about the chemical properties of the hercules stream did not admit safe conclusions about the origin of the stream .",
    "we note that the distinct and well separated chemical signatures that the two disks exhibit @xcite are less separated in the abundance plots in @xcite ( compare , e.g. , the abundance trends for oxygen in their fig .  10 with fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is likely an effect of merging different data sets , each containg different systematic errors .",

    "we selected hercules stream stars as those stars that have probabilities of belonging to the hercules stream that are at least as large as twice the probabilities of belonging to any of the other populations .",

    "high - resolution ( @xmath7 ) , high - quality ( @xmath8 ) echelle spectra were obtained for 60 f and g dwarfs by tb in jan , apr , and aug in 2006 with the mike spectrograph @xcite on the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "solar spectra were obtained during the runs by observing the asteroid vesta ( in jan ) , the jovian moon ganymede ( in apr ) , and the asteroid ceres ( in aug ) .    for the abundance analysis we used the uppsala marcs stellar model atmospheres @xcite .",

    "the solar system abundance of ba has been built up by two different production mechanisms that work on different timescales ; the @xmath5-process which dominated at low metallicities ( @xmath10\\lesssim-1.5 $ ] ) and contributed @xmath15% , and the @xmath6-process that dominated at higher metallicities and contributed @xmath16% @xcite . the increase ( or the  bump \" ) that can be seen in the [ ba / fe]-[fe / h ] trend for",
    "the thin disk is likely to be a signature of when the @xmath6-process enrichment from agb stars became significant @xcite . for other environments",
    "the mixture may be different , compare e.g. the ba and eu trends in @xcite .",
    "for the thick disk , the flat [ ba / fe ] trend could indicate that the @xmath6-process did not play a significant rle in the ba enrichment of the gas from which the thick disk formed ( and hence the lack of the  bump \" ) .",
    "a first impression is that most hercules stream stars follow the trends as outlined by the thick disk . in the [ ba / fe ]",
    "vs.  [ fe / h ] plot this is especially evident and even up to metallicities as high as @xmath10 \\approx + 0.1 $ ] . in the [ mg / fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] plot the hercules stars follow the thick disk trend up to @xmath10\\approx-0.2 $ ] and may then show signs of a mixing between the two disks for higher metallicities .",
    "the [ fe / mg ] and [ ba / mg ] trends with [ mg / h ] give similar results .",
    "apart from one star , hip44927 , we do not find any hercules stream stars that deviate from the thin and thick disk abundance trends .",
    "recent observations have shown that bulge stars have large @xmath4-enhancements at solar and super - solar metallicities @xcite .",
    "this compares very well with what we see for hip  44927 , indicating that we might have picked up a bulge star in our hercules sample .",
    "its age @xmath17gyr is , however , inconsistent with the bulge being an old population .",
    "but there are indications that the bulge could contain stars as young as a few hundred million years @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : agefeh ] we plot stellar ages versus [ fe / h ] . at metallicities below @xmath10=0 $ ]",
    "it appears that the hercules stream divides into two ( or maybe three ) branches : one that follows the thick disk age trend ( the downward age - metallicity relation we see for the thick disk trend was seen in @xcite and then verified by @xcite and @xcite ) ; one that follows the thin disk age trend ; and a few stars ( 4 - 5 ) that tend to have high ages of @xmath18gyr in the interval @xmath19\\lesssim0 $ ] .",
    "once again , we see that the stars of the hercules stream follow the trends outlined by the stars with kinematics typical of the thin and thick disks . as the uncertainties in the age determinations are notoriously difficult to estimate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and generally come out too small when using standard methods one should be careful to make far fetched interpretations about the few outliers .",
    "some galactic streams may have origins due to minor mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "could this be the case for the hercules stream ?",
    "such a merging system must then have had chemical properties similar to the present galactic disks .",
    "thus , such a merging galaxy must have had chemical properties that depart considerably from those of local dwarf galaxies ( cf .",
    ", e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and would presumably be more similar to a major spiral galaxy .",
    "there is no observational evidence that such a substantial merger occured in the milky way during the last 10gyr @xcite .",
    "instead , our results strongly suggest that the hercules stream has a dynamical origin , presumably due to the dynamical effects of the galactic bar , and it may consist of stars from the inner galactic disks .",
    "are we then tracing the inner thin disk or the inner thick disk ? as no detailed abundance data for the inner disks have been obtained yet , only indirect evidence is available .",
    "the thick disk velocity dispersion is about twice that of the thin disk , but its rotational velocity is just @xmath16% of that of the thin disk . according to the toomre stability criterion ( @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the thick disk should be slightly more stable than the thin disk ( @xmath21 ) and less disturbed by gravitational influences from the galactic bar .",
    "since the inner thin disk is thought to have more evolved stellar populations , as judged from its abundance and age gradients , the higher ages and @xmath9 $ ] ratios of the hercules stream seem consistent with an inner thin disk origin . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundance patterns are better matched to the thick disk in general , and it is plausible that the thick disk also has a metallicity gradient , which would then match the relative number of high - metallicity stars in the stream .    as the stars of the hercules stream display the distinct abundance and age trends of _ both _ the thin and thick disk stars , it is likely that it actually is a mixture of the two disks .",
    "this is also suggested by the toomre stability criterion being similar for the two disk components . a preliminary investigation of the relationship between the ages and abundance ratios for our stars in the hercules stream shows that they are correlated in a way expected for an hercules stream composed of galactic disk stars ( see further bensby et al .",
    "2007 , in prep . )",
    "the hercules stream is unique in the sense that it forms a well defined enhancement in the velocity distribution of nearby stars .",
    "however , large ranges in stellar ages and elemental abundances indicate that it is not a distinct stellar population",
    ". instead , as the age and abundance trends in the hercules stream are similar to the trends in the thin and thick disks , we conclude that the hercules stream is a mixture of thin and thick disk stars .",
    "this result is in concordance with models that suggest that the kinematical properties of the hercules stream are coupled to dynamical interactions with the galactic bar . whether the hercules stream stars have a real inner disk origin or whether they are nearby stars whose kinematics are an effect of the outer lindlad resonance of the bar , which may be situated near the solar neighbourhood @xcite , is unclear .",
    "further insights into this problem could be gained by making comparisons to detailed abundance data from the _ in situ _ inner galactic thin and thick disks . as such data currently are unavailable , we have initiated a study to obtain them .",
