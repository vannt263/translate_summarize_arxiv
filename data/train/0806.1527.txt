    "ngc604 is the second largest giant hii - region in the local group and has been studied throughout all wavelengths , from radio @xcite , infrared @xcite , optical @xcite , ultraviolet @xcite , to the x - ray regime @xcite .",
    "the main focus of these studies was the investigation of the effects that massive young stars impose on the surrounding multi - phase interstellar medium .",
    "it is commonly believed that ngc604 is ionized by the radiation field and winds from a young and very massive stellar population . a detailed analysis of the stellar content indicates the existence of about 200 o and wr - stars with a wr / o - ratio of about 0.075 @xcite . although the stellar content , the gas mass , and the average gas density of ngc604 are different compared to other giant hii - regions in , e.g. , the lmc , iizw40 , or ngc4214 @xcite , the blister - like structures and overall h@xmath1  morphology resulting from stellar winds and/or sne activity is very similar among all these regions .",
    "in this regard the similarity with 30dor in the lmc is the most striking ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides the warm ionized phase of the ism in ngc604 , the hot ionized medium ( him ) is another crucial , yet poorly investigated , phase of the ism which tells us much about the internal energetics , the wind - ism interaction , the evolution of the bubble , and the sources which power it . a difficulty in the past originated from the fact that several x - ray bright superbubbles ( @xmath7 ) in the lmc show an excess x - ray luminosity in comparison to predictions from the standard bubble model @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that this excess emission can be attributed to off - center snrs interacting with the shell walls @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray dim bubbles are found to be consistent with the standard model and do not require additional heating from snrs @xcite .",
    "another subdivision of stellar bubbles was introduced by @xcite who distinguished between high velocity bubbles , i.e. , those whose expansion velocity is underestimated by the standard model and those which are consistent with it .",
    "the emerging picture seems to be that x - ray bright , high velocity bubbles are additionally heated by snrs and that x - ray dim , slowly expanding bubbles do not require additional heating .    with the current study , which is part of the _ chandra _  acis survey of m33 ( chasem33 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we present the first detailed x - ray analysis of ngc604 in order to explore the origin of the x - ray emission and to test the wind - blown bubble scenario . although ngc604 ( @xmath8=817kpc , * ? ?",
    "* ) has been detected in previous major x - ray surveys @xcite , the only significant observation that has been published is a _",
    "_  contour map of the central part @xcite , which revealed that the bubbles seen in the optical are filled with x - ray emitting gas .",
    "however , the limited sensitivity from this 90ks observation ( obsid ) inhibited further analysis .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after an outline of the data reduction steps for imaging ( sect . 2.1 ) and",
    "spectroscopy ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) , we present the main results derived from both techniques in sect .",
    "3 . in sect . 4.1 we discuss the origin of the x - ray gas . by means of spectral modeling , we determine electron densities and filling factors of the him and derive x - ray gas masses for individual regions ( sect .",
    "4.1.1 ) . in sects 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 , we cross - check whether the stellar o / wr population in ngc604 can account for the observed x - ray gas masses via continuous stellar mass loss and if the observed x - ray luminosity is consistent with the one predicted from the `` standard '' model of a stellar wind - blown bubble @xcite",
    "is concluded by evaluating whether sne produced a significant fraction of the observed x - ray gas mass ( sect . 4.2 ) and by presenting a consistent picture of ngc604 which emerges from the multi - wavelength data analysis ( sect .",
    "a summary is provided in sect .",
    "this study is part of the _ chandra _  acis survey of m33 ( chasem33 ) and presents the first deep and high resolution x - ray images of the diffuse emission of .",
    "we chose 2 different acis - i fields , field2 from chasem33 ( using obsids , , and , @xmath0.03em4  off - axis ) and one archival field ( obsid 2023 , with ngc604 at the aim point ; see also dashed circle in fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the total integration time was 300ks .",
    "all chasem33  observations were performed with acis - i in ` very faint ' ( vfaint ) mode , whereas the archival one was obtained with acis - i in faint mode .",
    "all data were reprocessed with ciao version 3.4.1.1 and caldb version 3.3.0.1 .",
    "the basic data reduction was carried out by following standard procedures .",
    "first , a new level=2 eventfile was created with acis_process_events by applying new background flags for the vfaint and faint modes , correcting for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and time - dependent gain variations .",
    "pixel randomization was removed to avoid degrading the resolution of the data .",
    "the resulting event lists were filtered for events with grade=0,2,3,4,6 and status=0 , and the pipeline - generated good time intervals ( gti ) were applied .",
    "no aspect solution correction was needed .",
    "positional uncertainties are @xmath9 .",
    "subsequently , we checked for background flares by extracting a background light curve from the events on the acis - i3 chip , after removing point sources detected by the task wavdetect .",
    "an iterative sigma - clipping algorithm was used to remove time intervals with count rates more than @xmath10 from the mean of each iteration , until all count rates were within @xmath11 of the mean .",
    "the gti - corrected total exposure time was 294ks .",
    "we created x - ray images for each obsid in the following diagnostic energy bands : 0.358.0kev ( broad ) , 0.351.1kev ( soft ) , 1.12.6kev ( medium ) , and 2.68.0  kev ( hard ) .",
    "individual exposure maps for each obsid and energy band were computed using the ciao tools mkinstmap and mkexpmap . in order to ensure that the number of counts in each pixel of the exposure corrected image is proportional to the integrated number of counts of the incident source spectrum ( over a given energy band ) , weighted instrument maps were created assuming a spectrum representative of the diffuse x - ray emitting gas .",
    "we assumed an apec thermal plasma model with @xmath12kev @xcite and an averaged column density of  = @xmath13  @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the script merge_all was used to produce a merged event list and merged exposure maps for the different energy bands . merged images with integer counts ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) were created with dmcopy after applying bin and energy filters for the individual energy bands .",
    "exposure - corrected images were created by dividing the ( merged ) images by their associated ( merged ) exposure maps .",
    "all images were binned by 4 pixels to a resolution of @xmath0.03em2  to gain sensitivity and to compensate for varying psfs at different off - axis angles . the x - ray images which were used for the contour maps ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) and the rgb - image ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) were additionally smoothed in ds9 @xcite with a gaussian kernel radius of 2 pixels , to help enhance the contrast between background and diffuse emission .    for a multi - wavelength comparison of the different phases of the ism in ngc604",
    ", we also employed archival data collected at near infrared ( nir , _",
    "spitzer_/irac , 8@xmath15 m ) , optical ( _ hst_/wfpc2 , h@xmath1 , [ nii ] ) , and far ultraviolet ( fuv , _ galex _ , 1500 ) wavelengths . because we use the supplemental images exclusively for morphological comparison ,",
    "standard data pipeline calibration was applied .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "h@xmath1  image was also continuum subtracted using a scaled version of the v - band image .      because we are mainly interested in the purely diffuse emission of ngc604 , we removed point sources from every event list using the acis extract @xcite regions from the chasem33  point source catalog @xcite . for proper background removal , we ensured that the background regions ( boxes ) were located at the same distance from the readout node as our source regions ( to account for the row dependence of front - illuminated ccds ) . in order to improve photon statistics for the background data",
    ", we chose the sizes of these background regions to be approximately three times the size of the source region , yielding typically @xmath0.03em1200cts .    the ngc604 pointings ( field2 and the archival one ) differ in pointing direction and roll .",
    "we therefore did not produce a single merged event list and instead extracted source and background spectra from each individual event list .",
    "for this purpose we used specextract , which also creates custom response matrix files ( rmfs ) and appropriate auxiliary response files ( arfs ) .",
    "the merging of rmfs and arfs was done using the ftools tasks addarf and addrmf and by applying a weighting factor based on the gti - corrected exposure time taken from the exptime header keyword .",
    "finally , the merging of the spectra was accomplished with the task addspec .",
    "we ensured that each spectrum contained the proper backscal - keyword and was linked to its corresponding background - file .",
    "the source spectra were individually grouped with dmgroup until a signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) of at least 3 per channel was achieved .",
    "all spectra were fitted with xspec @xcite ver.12.3.1 , using an apec collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) model @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ f1 ] , we show counts images of ngc604 for the different energy bands on a linear min / max - scale . these images are not exposure corrected and therefore preserve integer counts to allow an evaluation of the number of counts in each pixel .",
    "pixels with observed counts consistent with background alone are shown in white ( 95% poission confidence ) . that is , assuming poission statistics , we are 95% confident that pixels with @xmath16 counts ( panels a and b ) and @xmath17 counts ( panels c and d ) belong to the background .            from these images it is obvious that ngc604 emits significant diffuse x - ray emission , most of it in the soft energy band , roughly forming the shape of an u. there is also significant soft emission in the north at ra=01@xmath1834@xmath19@xmath20 , dec=+3047420 ( all coordinates in this paper are given for j2000.0 ) , which was previously not detected by @xcite .",
    "emission seen in the medium x - ray band largely coincides with that seen in the soft band , but does not reach the same extent . in the hard x - ray band , we detect only two significant emission features , one at ra=01@xmath1834@xmath19@xmath21 , dec=+3047120 ( 15 net cts ) and the other at ra=01@xmath1834@xmath19@xmath22 , dec=+3047000 ( 6net cts ) .",
    "the bright extended source visible in the broad band at ra = 01@xmath1834@xmath1936.50@xmath23 and dec = + 3047150 ( chasem33  source 346 ) is most likely a background agn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the southernmost source located at ra=01@xmath1834@xmath1933@xmath23 and dec=3046400 can be identified with snr gkl98 - 94 @xcite and is listed as source number 342 in @xcite .",
    "another feature is the region of reduced x - ray emission running roughly north  south through the center of ngc604 and can best be seen in panels a and d.      in figs .",
    "[ f2]c[f2]f , we provide x - ray contour maps for ngc604 based on exposure corrected images in the same energy bands as shown in fig .",
    "these maps were smoothed in ds9 using a kernel radius of 2 pixels to enhance the contrast between source and background and are overlaid on the _ hst _  h@xmath1  image to allow a direct comparison with structures of the warm ionized gas . for each energy band , six contour levels are plotted on a sqrt - scale , starting at 3@xmath24 above the background .",
    "the b - band contours cover @xmath25 to @xmath26counts / s/@xmath27 , the h - band covers @xmath28@xmath29counts / s/@xmath27 , the m - band covers @xmath30@xmath31counts / s/@xmath27 , and the s - band covers @xmath32 to @xmath26counts / s/@xmath27 .",
    "the broad - band emission extends @xmath0250pc along the n - s axis and @xmath0240pc along the e - w axis , respectively . as can be seen from the _ hst _",
    "h@xmath1  image , the two hard x - ray sources as well as the x - ray - bright spot at medium energies do not have h@xmath1-emitting counterparts .",
    "the lack of x - rays at the center of ngc604 is likely due to internal absorption ( see below ) .",
    "snr gkl98 - 94 is not detected at energies above 2.6kev .",
    "however , to identify all those features and to constrain the origin of the gas , it is necessary to discuss the _",

    "observations in the framework of other multi - wavelength data .      the multicolor image in fig .",
    "[ f3]a combines narrowband _ hst _",
    "imaging ( h@xmath1  and [ nii ] ) with the soft x - ray emission detected by _",

    "the hot gas appears to bend around the h@xmath1  ridge @xcite , roughly forming a u-shaped structure ( cf .",
    "[ f3 ] also shows the negative morphological and spatial correlation between soft x - rays and h@xmath1-emitting gas .",
    "a similar negative correlation is also seen in comparing the soft x - ray emission with the 8.4ghz radio continuum map presented by @xcite .",
    "this kind of morphological anticorrelation agrees well with our understanding of the assembly and composition of a multi - phase ism . a much more detailed view of the complex morphology of ngc604 is provided by the first high - resolution ( 2 ) three color x - ray image of ngc604 ( fig .  [ f3]b ) .",
    "on this image the u-shaped soft x - ray emission is clearly visible , bending around the prominent ridge of ionized hydrogen and molecular gas ( fig .",
    "[ f3]d ) .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the ionization structure ( and thus the radiation field ) as well as the velocity field in the western part is completely different from that in the eastern part .",
    "this can be attributed to the presence of the h@xmath1  ridge which may be shielding the east from the violent stellar evolutionary processes and the hard radiation field in the west .",
    "this kind of dichotomy is also reflected by the distribution of the fuv emission ( fig .",
    "[ f3]c ) which is a tracer of the stellar continuum emitted by hot stars .",
    "the bulk fuv emission originates westwards of the h@xmath1  ridge and coincides with the northern part of star cluster a @xcite which contains about 200 o / wr stars .",
    "considering the stellar winds of such stars , it appears to be reasonable to attribute the existence of the x - ray emission in that region to stellar mass loss .",
    "however , the x - ray emission in the north and east of ngc604 is unlikely to be explained by the same kind of ionization mechanism , simply because of the absence of similarly massive clusters .    as there is no significant hot gas detectable beyond the outer extent of the warm ionized gas",
    ", one might think of ngc604 as a giant boiling hii - region whose bubbles partly broke out , merged , and formed the observed blister - like structures .",
    "the released x - ray gas , however , still has not yet penetrated the outer hii - shell .",
    "some of the x - ray emitting regions found by our survey overlap with areas investigated in the optical by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . because these studies did not use a common nomenclature and the borders of the investigated areas are unknown in some cases , and because our study also incorporates new regions",
    ", we decided to define our own regions and nomenclature .",
    "the interesting areas are highlighted by solid white lines in fig .",

    "shapes and sizes , i.e. the assumed geometries , of the emitting regions are shown as white dashed lines and were estimated by examining the available multi - wavelength data .",

    "we also investigate some non - spherical regions which we call cavities ( c1c3 ) .",
    "these cavities are also important , because the bubbles seem to be either connected to or embedded in these regions , suggesting that the cavities are also influenced by the stellar wind and radiation field .",
    "a nice example is b1 which seems to be part of the much larger cavity c1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f2]b for a sketch of ngc604 ) .",

    "although mass loss of the current stellar generation could account for approximately 4% of the observed x - ray luminosity in c2 and b3 , it appears more likely that most of the mass of the hot gas was produced by previous stellar wind activity with possible additional heating by sne .",
    "it is important to note that we also checked how the x - ray luminosities and gas masses obtained for the western and eastern part of ngc604 change if the @xmath76 is fixed to a lower ( galactic ) value of 5.21@xmath233 @xcite and to an upper value of 1.3@xmath87 @xcite . in both cases",
    "the results were consistent with those obtained for the fixed average @xmath76 of 1.1@xmath87 .",
    "the maximum deviations are 14% .",
    "in addition we also allowed the @xmath76 to vary during the fits .",
    "the fitted values of the @xmath76 were poorly constrained with large uncertainties and a large spread in the derived values . for four regions ( c2 , b2 , b3 , and t ) the fitted values of the @xmath76 were consistent with 1.1@xmath87 . for regions c1 and c3 , the fitted values ( 0.24@xmath87 and 0.11@xmath87 ) were less than the galactic column and therefore considered unreliable . for region b1 ,",
    "the fitted value was 3.83@xmath87 , which is larger than the total column through m33  and therefore also unreliable . given the poor constraints on @xmath76 from the x - ray spectral fits , we decided to adopt the results of the spectral fits which had assumed a fixed value of 1.1@xmath87 .",
    "however , the luminosities and gas masses for an unconstrained @xmath76 were always within the range of uncertainty provided by the fits which assumed a lower and upper @xmath76 of 5.21@xmath233 and 1.3@xmath87 , respectively .",
    "we need to constrain the number of sne to evaluate whether they contribute significantly to the energy injected into the ism and to the determined x - ray gas mass .",
    "this kind of investigation can only be done reliably if high resolution spectrophotometric data for all regions are available . unfortunately , the available data restrict a detailed exploration of the stellar population exclusively to the western part of ngc604 .",
    "@xcite investigated about 50 ob - stars in cluster a covering the mass range from @xmath234 .",
    "they assumed a salpeter imf with @xmath235 and compared the predicted number of stars with their observations . in the mass range between @xmath236 two stars",
    "would have been expected , but none were detected .",
    "we therefore assume that these stars , if formed , exploded as sne during the last 3myr .",
    "interestingly , the 3 most massive ( @xmath237 ) and extremely rare stars still seem to exist which would imply that they formed during the last 3myr",
    ". however , these authors do not rule out that these stars are unresolved massive binaries .",
    "because the above mentioned study covers only @xmath025% of the massive stellar population in cluster a , we need to scale the expected number of sne accordingly . since the number of exploded stars of the remaining population is unknown and",
    "may also vary from region to region , we simply extrapolate linearly and obtain a conservative upper limit of 8 sne during the last 3myr .",
    "the total thermal energy of the gas in the western part provided by stellar wind activity amounts to about @xmath238erg , which is roughly equivalent to the energy input of about 25 sne .",
    "this number of sne is three times higher than our estimate of the expected number of sne and is therefore inconsistent with the assumption that sne contributed significantly to the heating of the gas .",
    "besides the fact that the x - ray luminosity can be well explained by stellar mass loss alone , there is another aspect which argues against contributions from sne .",
    "the starburst models from @xcite show that the total energy input from stars formed during an instantaneous starburst 3myr ago , is entirely provided by stellar winds .",
    "this lets us assume that no or only a few sne occurred during the lifetime of the current stellar generation and that mass load by sne is negligible .",
    "although there could have been a couple of sne , they would not have provided significant heating .",
    "the thermal energy of the x - ray gas from stellar winds amounts to @xmath0@xmath239erg and is five times smaller than the total thermal energy .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained , e.g. , by radiative cooling due to excessive mass injection by evaporation @xcite or by energy losses from the hot interior due to outflowing gas . because the stellar population in the eastern part is completely unconstrained ,",
    "we refrain from making predictions of the expected number of sne .      in x - rays as well as at optical wavelengths",
    "a clear dichotomy is seen in ngc604 .",
    "the western part seems to be a young ( @xmath03myr ) and dynamically active region in which ongoing stellar mass loss is most likely responsible for the observed x - ray gas mass and luminosity .",
    "this part of ngc604 is x - ray bright compared to the bubbles of the lmc studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such x - ray bright bubbles usually require additional energy input from snrs in order to reconcile the observed luminosity with the predicted one from the standard bubble model .",
    "hence , the western hemisphere of ngc604 seems to be a new case in which an x - ray - bright bubble is produced by stellar mass loss and the current stellar population either has not formed sne , or any sne so far were inefficient in heating the gas .",
    "the eastern hemisphere appears to be an aged structure in which the gas seems to be in a dynamically relaxed condition .",
    "this relaxation could be caused by the lack of ionizing sources and the presence of the h@xmath1  ridge which most likely shields this region from the east .",
    "the likely reason why this part of ngc604 is also x - ray bright and has by far the highest temperatures is that radiative cooling is negligible in regions of this size @xcite .",
    "it also implies that the gas is indeed confined to c2 and b3 .",
    "contrary to the west , the observed x - ray luminosity in c2 and b3 can not be explained by current stellar mass loss alone . in this case",
    ", off - center snrs could produce the additional emission @xcite .    due to the lack of identified young clusters , the x - ray emission in c3 most likely does not originate from local stellar clusters ; clusters c and d @xcite are too far off - center to contribute significantly .",
    "therefore , the emission in c3 could originate from the shocked stellar wind expelled by clusters a and b. if this is correct it also follows that the ism is highly porous , because the overpressured hot gas can stream freely some 200pc from b1 through c1 into c3 and fill large cavities .",
    "such supersonic motions can explain the large filling factors of the him and are a characteristic feature in models of wind - blown bubbles .",
    "these streaming motions should also cause characteristic shock features when the supersonic wind interacts with the gas of the shell wall .",
    "the medium x - ray emission along the h@xmath1  ridge and at the h@xmath1-cap seen in the contour map ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) and in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] can be interpreted as fingerprints of such shocks .",
    "this shock scenario is consistent with the crossing timescale of the stellar wind which emerges from clusters a and b and traverses cavity c1 , which is of the order of @xmath0@xmath240yr , assuming that the wind slows down from originally @xmath241 to a conservative value of @xmath242 .",
    "a little less than 1myr is required for the wind to reach the top of cavity c3 ( assuming the same wind speed ) .",
    "these timescales are much shorter than the cluster age , and therefore , if sne and snrs can be ignored , the wind could get continuously shocked over a period of several million years .",
    "we presented the first x - ray images of ngc604 , that are deep enough to reveal the complex interplay among different constituents of the ism .",
    "a strong negative morphological correlation was found between h@xmath1  and x - ray emitting gas .",
    "all bubbles and cavities are filled with hot coronal gas ( @xmath243k ) , suggesting high volume filling factors of about @xmath142 and densities @xmath244@xmath81 .    a total ,",
    "absorption - corrected , diffuse x - ray luminosity in the soft band ( 0.352.5kev ) of @xmath245ergs@xmath5 was found for ngc604 , which is about 14% of the corresponding value for 30dor @xcite .",
    "the x - ray gas mass in ngc604 amounts to about 6000@xmath3 , which is only 15% of the corresponding mass in 30dor @xcite , and emphasizes the differences between the two largest hii - regions of the local group even more .",
    "the sum of the detected x - ray gas mass in the western part of ngc604 , containing regions b1 , b2 , c1 , and c3 , amounts to @xmath0@xmath210m@xmath211 and the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath228ergs@xmath5 places this region into the regime of x - ray bright bubbles .",
    "both , the x - ray gas mass and the luminosity agree well with expectations from the standard bubble model and are consistent with mass loss from about 200 o / wr - stars . in view of an estimated cluster age of 3myr , the consistency between observed and expected luminosities , and the predictions from the starburst models from @xcite , the current stellar generation seems to be too young for sne to have made a significant contribution to heating .",
    "the western hemisphere contradicts the general view in which the luminosity of x - ray bright bubbles is underestimated by the standard model and additional contributions from snrs are required .",
    "the x - ray gas likely originates from the stellar o - type population in clusters a and b. we find that mass load from evaporation due to thermal conduction contributes about 95% to the x - ray gas mass .    in the eastern hemisphere the estimated mass of x - ray emitting gas amounts to @xmath0@xmath246m@xmath211 .",
    "the sum of the predicted x - ray luminosity from regions b3 and c2 which one would expect from a shocked stellar wind during the lifetime of the donor stars , largely underestimates the observed unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath247ergs@xmath5 by about a factor of 30 .",
    "this result supports the hypothesis that the luminosity of x - ray bright bubbles is inconsistent with the one predicted by the standard bubble model and argues for additional contributions from snrs .",
    "we rule out a shocked stellar wind produced by the current stellar generation as the main source of the x - ray emission .",
    "we can not rule out that the gas was created during an era when the stellar population was powerful enough to drive a continuous wind and/or sne heated the gas .",
    "the number of expected sne in c2 and b3 , respectively , remains unconstrained due to the lack of spectrophotometric data of the stellar population .",
    "the dichotomy between east and west was also found for the warm ionized gas .",
    "@xcite noted that the dynamics and ionization of the gas in the eastern part of ngc604 is completely different from the western part .",
    "as in the case of the him , the h@xmath1  ridge appears to play an important role by separating both hemispheres .",
    "the eastern region seems to be an old part of ngc604 in which the warm gas appears to be in a dynamically relaxed condition .",
    "in contrast , the western region is dominated by young stars which create a highly dynamical ism via strong stellar winds and contribute essentially @xmath248 to the x - ray gas mass and luminosity .",
    "the freely - streaming winds in ngc604 should produce characteristic emission features when they interact with the shell walls .",
    "therefore , we interpret the medium x - ray emission along the h@xmath1  ridge and at the h@xmath1-cap as direct fingerprints of such shocks . provided this is correct , these spots of enhanced emission would confirm the expected supersonic motions of the gas .",
