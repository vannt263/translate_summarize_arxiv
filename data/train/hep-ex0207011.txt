    "we present results on the diffractive electroproduction of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath6 scattering at high energy : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is either a proton ( `` elastic '' scattering ) or a baryonic system of mass @xmath10 much lower than the @xmath11 center of mass ( cms ) energy @xmath3 ( `` proton dissociative '' scattering . )    at low @xmath1 , the negative of the intermediate photon four - momentum squared , the @xmath11 cross section is characterized by a `` soft '' energy dependence due to pomeron ( @xmath12 ) exchange with @xmath13 , where the soft pomeron trajectory is parametrized  @xcite as @xmath14 , @xmath4 being the square of the four - momentum transfer to the proton .    for @xmath1  larger than a few , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is expected to apply and diffractive @xmath0 production is viewed in the proton rest frame as a sequence of three processes well separated in time : the photon fluctuation into a @xmath15  pair , the hard interaction of the @xmath15  pair with the proton via the exchange of two gluons in a color - singlet state , and the the @xmath15  pair recombination into a real @xmath0 meson .",
    "the cross section is then proportional to the square of the gluon density in the proton , which provides a fast increase of the @xmath5 cross section with the energy ( `` hard '' behavior )  @xcite .",
    "the data , taken with the h1 detector in 1997 and 2000 , correspond to integrated luminosities of 6 @xmath16 and 42 @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the 1997 data are dedicated to the study of the `` high @xmath2 '' regime  @xcite in the kinematic domain @xmath17 , @xmath18  and @xmath19 gev .",
    "this sample includes both elastic and proton dissociative events .",
    "the `` high @xmath1 '' regime is investigated using the 2000 data in the kinematic domain @xmath20 , @xmath21 gev and @xmath22  ( elastic channel only ) .",
    "the @xmath1  dependence of the @xmath23 cross section for @xmath24 gev is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2t]a .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath25 for the range @xmath26  results in @xmath27 ( full line ) .",

    "measured values of the @xmath29 parameter are shown as a function of @xmath1  in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2t]b : @xmath29 decreases as @xmath1  increases , reflecting the decrease of the transverse size of the @xmath15  pair , down to values close to the @xmath30  case in photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath23 cross section , parametrised as @xmath31 , has been measured in four @xmath1  intervals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w ] ) . a clear transition from a `` soft '' to a `` hard '' behavior is observed when @xmath1  increases , reaching values similar to the @xmath30  in photoproduction  @xcite , where the charm quark mass acts as a hard scale in pqcd .",

    "the measurement of the production and decay angular distibutions gives access to the spin density matrix elements , which characterise the helicity states of the photon and the @xmath0 meson , and which are bilinear combinations of the helicity amplitudes @xmath32",

    "the matrix element and the combinations  and  have been measured for the `` high @xmath2 '' and the `` high @xmath1 '' data samples .    in case of @xmath35-channel helicity conservation ( schc ) ,",
    "the helicity of the @xmath0 meson and the photon are the same and the combinations and  vanish .",
    "calculations based on pqcd  @xcite predict schc violations with the following qualitative @xmath4 dependences : a ratio constant with @xmath4 for the helicity conserving amplitudes ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , a @xmath38 dependence for the ratio of the single helicity flip ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) to the non - flip amplitudes , a linear dependence for the ratio of the double flip ( @xmath41 ) to the non - flip amplitudes .",
    "the matrix element  is related to the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse non - flip amplitudes ; the @xmath4 dependence of the combination is dominated by the @xmath39 amplitude , and that of the  combination by @xmath42 .",
    "[ fig : r4]a presents @xmath43 as a function of @xmath1 , extracted from the measurement of the   matrix element .",
    "the significant increase of @xmath44 with @xmath1   is compatible the pqcd based prediction  @xcite , shown as a full line .",

    "the expected schc violation is confirmed .",
    "the `` high @xmath2 '' sample is well described by prediction based on the model from ref .",
    "the very weak dependence of  with @xmath2  indicates that , in the measured range , the longitudinal and the transverse cross sections have similar @xmath4 dependences .",
