    "a good understanding and control over such phenomenon can lead to many novel devices , specially in metrology @xcite .",
    "the experimental results are analyzed in a series of works , using effective variables like quantum capacitance @xcite .",
    "capacitance of mesoscopic systems are very different from geometric capacitance . in mesoscopic systems",
    "one can differentiate between electrostatic capacitance and electro - chemical capacitance .",
    "although , in principle one can also define a magnetic field induced capacitance , in practice one defines a field dependent electrostatic or electrochemical capacitance @xcite .",
    "ref @xcite gives a detailed analysis of electrochemical capacitance which gives corrections to the geometrical capacitance due to field penetration into the conductor which occurs over a finite length scale comparable to the dimensions of the sample and ignored in large systems .",
    "electrochemical capacitance is a property of open systems ( systems connected to leads and electron reservoirs ) . in such open systems ,",
    "electron - electron interaction can not be treated exactly and characteristic potentials were introduced to account for coulomb interaction approximately . the correction term appear as another capacitance in series with the geometric capacitance .",
    "both , open and closed systems can have an electro - static voltage induced capacitance .",
    "a closed system of a finite wire ( referred as a stub ) connected to a closed ring was analyzed in ref .",
    "the system was reduced to a two level system , wherein there is a hybridization of a single level coming from the stub and another single level coming from the ring .",
    "coulomb interaction was again treated approximately with the help of characteristic potentials and single particle level approximations .",
    "quantum corrections was again shown to appear as a capacitance that appear in series with the geometric capacitance .",
    "the quantum capacitance is given by the lindhard function @xcite .",
    "subsequently , several authors have tried to interpret experimental data and numerical calculations in terms of quantum capacitance @xcite . a microscopic analysis stating under",
    "what circumstances and assumptions one can use such a parameter is not done so far .",
    "capacitance of a system is self consistently determined by coulomb interactions and this is no exception for quantum capacitance as well .",
    "however , quantum mechanically electrons can also interact via fermi statistics and so even when coulomb interaction is ignored , a system can have a quantum capacitance .",
    "while geometric or classical capacitance is determined by the volume , shape and dielectric constant of the system , charge in quantum mechanics can reside in orbitals that do not have a space - time description .",
    "the existence of an effective variable of quantum capacitance , can simplify the complexity of many body physics .    unlike that in open systems , electron - electron interaction and statistics can be treated exactly in closed systems . in this work we deal with closed systems so that an analytical proof can be given and exact numerical diagonalization is possible for verification .",
    "we would like to analyze the assumptions and concepts required to arrive at a statistical mechanical variable of electrostatic quantum capacitance . when a system is weakly coupled to a reservoir , making it an open system",
    ", one can describe the system in terms of the eigenenergies of the system and fermi - dirac distribution function @xcite .",
    "so our results are also valid for weakly coupled open systems .",
    "electro - chemical potential also works by affecting the electrostatic potential inside the system @xcite .",
    "so if electrostatic quantum capacitance can not be proved then electro - chemical quantum capacitance may also not hold .",
    "our analysis is independent of model and valid for any arbitrary geometry in any dimension .",
    "however , we will use some models and systems for numerical verification , that are described in section ii .",
    "analytical derivation of quantum capacitance is given in section iii .",
    "conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "we have given in fig . 1 , schematic diagrams of a ring ( fig .",
    "1a ) , a stub connected to a ring ( fig .",
    "1b ) , and a 2d square geometry ( fig .",
    "although our analysis is not restricted to these geometries , we will use them as reference and examples . figs .",
    "( 1a ) , ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) represents continuum cases whereas figs .",
    "( 1d ) , ( 1e ) and ( 1f ) represent discrete versions of the same systems as that in ( 1a ) , ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) , respectively .",
    "discrete models are useful for numerical analysis .",
    "the vector potential due to a magnetic field can non - trivially change the electronic states of a system ( due to quantum interference ) while having very little effect on the bound positive charges that can be assumed to be uniform @xcite .",
    "it is very easy to see polarization due to vector potential in rings as the magnetic field can remain confined to the center of the ring while the electrons in the ring feel only the vector potential",
    ". however , it also occurs in small two - dimensional or three - dimensional quantum systems where weak magnetic fields have negligible effect ( lorentz s force being weighted down by the velocity of light ) , but vector potential will drastically change the states of the system due to interference effects . for numerical verification , we use the generalized hubbard hamiltonian describing a discrete system consisting of sites .",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the site energy of the @xmath3th site , @xmath4 is the hopping parameter ( in presence of magnetic field it becomes complex , i.e. , @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively , the on site and nearest neighbor coulomb interaction . in fig .",
    "2 we show a three dimensional ring ( shaded region ) with a flux @xmath8 through the center of the ring that can cause polarization . at a particular point",
    "@xmath9 on the ring we can bring an stm tip at a voltage @xmath10 to cause further polarization at that position @xmath9 ( or @xmath3 ) while another stm tip can measure the local potential @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) at @xmath9 ( or @xmath3 ) .",
    "the polarization charge in a segment of the ring can be measured by a cylinder around the ring by looking at the induced charge on this cylinder ( unshaded contour in fig .",
    "we will outline here all the mathematical steps required to describe the polarization of a quantum system in terms of electrostatic quantum capacitance .",
    "when assumptions are used , we will give numerical verification and also cite appropriate earlier works .",
    "suppose the potential @xmath11 at a point @xmath9 is changed infinitesimally giving rise to a delta potential term in the hamiltonian , of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coordinate of the @xmath15th electron .",
    "the kohn - hohenberg theorem @xcite states that the energy is an unique functional of the local potential .",
    "but we just use first order perturbation correction to the energy which is in terms of the applied potential only and no self consistency is required .",
    "so the increase in energy of the system can be expanded as @xmath16 @xmath17 as @xmath18 , then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the charge at @xmath9 .",
    "we verify this numerically for all the geometries shown in fig .",
    "1 . a plot is shown in fig . 3 for a disordered ring",
    "whose site energies @xmath2 vary from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . other parameters are explained in figure caption . we have used a single disorder configuration as the agreement is equally same for all other configurations .",
    "the figure shows the correctness of eq .",
    "3 . we stress that we use exact diagonalization using lanczos algorithm to determine @xmath23 and @xmath24 and",
    "hence this is a numerical verification of eq .",
    "3 .    therefore",
    ", we can define a lindhard function @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 the last step follows from eq .",
    "3 . for the geometry in fig .",
    "1(a ) or 1(b ) or 1(d ) or 1(e ) , we can change the magnetic flux @xmath8 through the center .",
    "this will immediately cause a redistribution of electronic charge in every site of the system .",
    "this is shown in fig . 4 for the site numbered 8 in a 11 site ring .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between fig .",
    "1(d ) and 1(e ) even when the stub is weakly coupled to the ring .",
    "also consider a case when an external voltage @xmath27 is applied at site @xmath3 ( in the discrete model one can change @xmath2 infinitesimally as @xmath12 and @xmath2 are linearly related ) . obviously one can change both , @xmath8 and @xmath28 simultaneously .",
    "charge at site @xmath3 , @xmath24 will change . due to electron - electron interaction the local potential @xmath12 , will change .",
    "such a potential change will in turn have a feedback effect on charge displacement to determine @xmath29 .",
    "this feedback effect is a purely quantum effect as this feedback occurs because the initial charge displacement ( in this case induced by externally changed flux or potential ) can change the quantum states or eigen - energies of the system .",
    "the externally applied flux and potential also work indirectly by affecting the quantum states of the system .",
    "in other words external changes give rise to electron displacements for which potential at site @xmath3 ( or @xmath30 ) change , and this in turn gives rise to further charge displacements that is self consistently determined by coulomb interactions and fermi statistics .",
    "@xmath29 ( or @xmath31 ) is this self consistently determined increment in potential at site @xmath3 ( or site @xmath30 ) and @xmath32 is the self consistently determined charge at site @xmath3",
    ". we can begin by writing for the discrete system @xmath33 although @xmath24 is a functional of @xmath12 , one can change the potential infinitesimally at a particular point without changing the potential at any other point to define a partial derivative and this is in fact done to arrive at the concept of functional derivative @xcite . not to mention , that in the standard definition for total derivatives , @xmath34 is change in @xmath24 due to an infinitesimal test change in @xmath12 ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) , but @xmath32 on the lhs and @xmath29 and @xmath31 on the rhs are actual changes which in these systems are determined self consistently . by the virtue of the fact that we are considering a sum over @xmath30",
    "makes our treatment valid for any geometry and any dimension , where the sum over @xmath30 will run over all the sites making the system . for the continuous system eq .",
    "6 becomes , where the sum is replaced by an integration , @xmath35 here partial derivative with respect to @xmath11 means we are changing the potential in the region @xmath9 to @xmath36 infinitesimally @xcite . in the following we will argue analytically and numerically that @xmath37 or by replacing the sum by integration , @xmath38 while lhs is a sum of partial derivatives , the rhs is a functional derivative .",
    "integration or sum of all ( but one point ) partial derivatives on the lhs is approximately a total derivative .",
    "had this one point ( @xmath39 ) been included it would have been an exact total derivative with respect to energy ( electronic charge times potential being energy ) @xcite .",
    "so in the above approximation an energy derivative is being replaced by a functional derivative with respect to local potential .",
    "this approximation is known in other context like deriving the semi - classical limit of friedel sum rule @xcite .",
    "that means this approximation is valid in the semi classical regime .",
    "numerical verification of the approximate equality in eq . 8 above",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "5 . by doing exact numerical diagonalization",
    "it is difficult to go to a truly semi - classical limit as that will require us to take a large ring .",
    "however , the approximation in eqs . 8 and 9 are known in context of deriving the semi - classical limit of friedel sum rule @xcite .",
    "if this approximation holds then one can relate induced voltage and polarization charge through quantum capacitance as shown below .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "6 and 8 , @xmath40 similarly , from eq . 7 and 9 ,",
    "@xmath41 we have to assume that @xmath31 is independent of @xmath30 as further explained below .",
    "now it follows from charge conservation that @xmath42 the rhs is the net change in @xmath24 due to an infinitesimal functional increase ( or decrease ) in the potential at all points except at @xmath3 .",
    "that is equivalent to not changing the potential anywhere but decreasing ( or increasing ) the potential at @xmath3 infinitesimally .",
    "due to charge conservation the change in charge at @xmath3 will be the same in both cases .",
    "coulomb repulsion tends to distribute charge uniformly in a system . on the other hand quantum interference effect tends to give rise to un - even distribution of charge . assuming that in the semi - classical regime , coulomb interactions dominate over quantum interference effects and distributes the charge uniformly , @xmath31 becomes independent of @xmath30 and we denote it as @xmath43 .",
    "numerical calculations for small size quantum systems show that for a wide range of parameter space the charge distribution is uniform @xcite .",
    "only in very low density regime , quantum interference effects dominate and the charge density breaks up into crests and troughs @xcite . any measurement process may not be able to resolve these crests and troughs and may show an average value for the local potential implying @xmath31 can be taken to be independent of @xmath30 .",
    "transverse variation can be mapped to an effective variation in the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "so one can write to a linear order , @xmath44 where c is the definition of geometric or classical capacitance .",
    "we know that when we ignore quantum interference effects ( i.e. , large systems without boundary and impurity effects averaged out or treated in random phase approximation ) we can always get such a linear regime .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "12 and eq .",
    "13 in eq . 10 and",
    "simplifying one gets that    @xmath45    now since @xmath46 can be changed by changing @xmath12 or @xmath8 , one can write @xmath47",
    ". therefore , @xmath48 since , the region indexed @xmath49 is very small compared to the rest of the system , @xmath50 therefore , @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( 14 ) it follows that @xmath52 multiplying both sides of the above equation by @xmath53 we get , @xmath54 or on using eq .",
    "13 @xmath55 or @xmath56 where , @xmath57 that is @xmath58 when we define capacitance we do not consider the sign of the charge .",
    "normally one plate of the capacitor has charge @xmath59 and the other has charge @xmath60 , wherein we write @xmath61 .",
    "hence if we want to include quantum effects then only in the semi - classical regime we find it possible to describe polarization in terms of capacitance .",
    "a quantum capacitor of capacitance @xmath62 in series with the classical capacitance determines the effective capacitance of the system .",
    "the characteristic potential ( or the potential difference between two parts of the ring ) is determined by this effective variable .",
    "the ac response of the ring is also determined by this effective variable along with the inductance . for a purely capacitive response , @xmath63 or @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "such an effective variable will exist only if assumptions given in eq .",
    "3 , eq . 8 , and eq .",
    "15 are valid .",
    "although quantum capacitance was introduced first by serge luryi @xcite , he introduced it on very general grounds and the above relation was not obtained .",
    "the above relation was obtained for a closed system only in the frame work of single particle two level system @xcite .",
    "we have derived it generally for any arbitrary system including many body effects and outlined the assumptions so that such an effective variable will exist .    in figs . 6 and 7",
    "we have made a comparison of quantum capacitance at site 8 , i.e. , @xmath65 in the non - interacting system and the interacting system to show that @xmath62 is a good parameter to effectively capture the effect of coulomb repulsion .",
    "here again we are considering the 11 site disordered ring considered in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "we have applied a small external potential at the 8th site to evaluate @xmath66 .",
    "6 is for the non - interacting case i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 although the electrons still interact through fermi statistics . in fig 7",
    "we have made @xmath69 with all other parameters remaining the same .",
    "there is a large qualitative as well as quantitative difference between the two figures which shows the importance of including coulomb interaction and many body effects in defining capacitance .",
    "@xmath70 can be measured as outlined in fig .",
    "2 . @xmath71",
    "can also be measured as outlined in fig .",
    "geometrical capacitance @xmath72 is independent of finite size or quantum interference effects and is known for a given sample from its bulk properties .",
    "so one can determine @xmath73 .",
    "thus @xmath29 and @xmath43 can be known for any applied external potentials as @xmath73 is the single parameter that determines this .",
    "in conclusion , in the semi - classical regime we prove polarization charge and induced potential of a mesoscopic isolated sample are related by an effective capacitance @xmath73 .",
    "effective capacitance can be decoupled as a linear combination of classical capacitance and quantum capacitance .",
    "the quantum capacitance is given by the lindhard function .",
    "in this regime , we can design quantum circuits in terms of this parameter @xmath73 just as classical circuits are built in terms of parameters like resistance , capacitance and inductance . while in earlier works , eq .",
    "18 was derived for single particle theory for a two level system , we have started from the principles of many body physics and derived eq . 18 for any arbitrary geometry in any dimension .",
    "we have shown the approximations necessary to get this in the framework of fully interacting fermions .",
    "all these approximations are justified in the semi - classical limit .",
    "18 can provide a simple way to understand dc and ac response of quantum finite sized many body electronic systems in the semi - classical limit , in terms of an effective variable .",
