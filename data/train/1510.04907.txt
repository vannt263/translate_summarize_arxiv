    "metal chalcogenides comprise an important class of semiconductors for optoelectronics , photovoltaics , and thermoelectrics.@xcite recently , raman spectroscopies and pump probe experiments on examples such as bi@xmath2s@xmath3  and sb@xmath2s@xmath3  have demonstrated the importance of phonons in modulating fundamental scattering processes@xcite .",
    "even though phonon dispersions have been reliably obtained for some of these materials@xcite , a first - principles study of the anharmonic effects due to phonon - phonon scatterings that account for thermal conductivities and thermal expansion coefficients ( tecs ) has been lacking .",
    "this could be attributed to the fact that metal chalcogenides have a relatively large primitive cell and a low - symmetry orthorhombic structure with three lattice parameters , in contrast to some of the well - studied cubic structures with a single lattice parameter@xcite .",
    "tecs may routinely be calculated using a direct minimization approach within the quasi - harmonic approximation@xcite . however , for metal chalcogenides , huge computational costs are needed to perform many phonon calculations to locate a free energy minimum at a given temperature in the three - dimensional lattice parameter space .",
    "moreover , even if a direct minimization approach could be carried out , it may be difficult to understand the underlying physics without investigating fundamental quantities such the grneisen  parameters , elastic constants , heat capacities and mean - square displacements .",
    "here we should mention a recent first - principles approach that is based on the vibrational self - consistent - field to calculate tecs@xcite . in another work@xcite ,",
    "a nonequilibrium green s function method is used to calculate tecs of carbon nanotubes and graphene with a force - field potential .",
    "in this paper we adopt the grneisen  formalism@xcite to predict the thermal properties of a low - symmetry orthorhombic system with a first - principles method . to the best of our knowledge",
    "it is the first time a first - principles thermal expansion study has been done on a crystal that is characterized by three lattice parameters .",
    "we find that the linear tecs of an orthorhombic system in the @xmath8 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 directions , denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively , at a temperature @xmath12 may be described by a matrix equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the equilibrium volume of the primitive cell , and @xmath16 is the elastic compliance matrix@xcite with matrix elements @xmath17 being the elastic constants .",
    "a component @xmath18 of the vector @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where the integral is over the first brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "a phonon mode with frequency @xmath21 is labeled by a mode index @xmath22 and a wave vector @xmath23 .",
    "the heat capacity of a phonon mode with frequency @xmath1 at temperature @xmath12 is @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the planck and boltzmann constants , respectively .",
    "the mode grneisen  parameters @xmath28 measure the relative change of phonon frequencies @xmath29 as a result of deformations applied to the crystal characterized by strain parameters @xmath30 .    to illustrate the usefulness of our method , we carry out density - functional theory calculations using the plane - wave basis quantum espresso suite@xcite on sb@xmath2s@xmath3 , an example of metal chalcogenides with a small direct bandgap of @xmath31  ev .",
    "the local density approximation is used to describe the exchange - correlation .",
    "pseudopotentials based on the rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos@xcite approach as found in the `` atomic code '' of the standard quantum espresso distribution are used .",
    "a large cutoff energy of @xmath32  ry is used throughout and a monkhorst - pack mesh of @xmath33 is used for @xmath34-point sampling .",
    "atomic relaxation is stopped when the forces on all the atoms are less than @xmath35  mev /  .",
    "we use the nonsymmorphic space group @xmath36 to describe sb@xmath2s@xmath3  with 20 atoms in a primitive cell , of which 5 are inequivalent .",
    "we obtain @xmath37 , @xmath38  , and @xmath39   , in good agreement with experimental values.@xcite the phonon modes are calculated using the density - functional perturbation theory.@xcite phonon calculations are carried out on a @xmath40 mesh of @xmath41 , which is equivalent to a @xmath42 supercell force - constant@xcite phonon calculation , the efficacy of which has been confirmed@xcite .",
    "we note that the results do not appreciably change when we use a larger @xmath40 mesh of @xmath43 . for the @xmath40 mesh of @xmath44",
    ", dynamical matrices have to be calculated at 12 irreducible @xmath40 points . for a general @xmath40 point ,",
    "one has to loop through 60 irreducible representations , each of which requires a number of self - consistent - field calculations .",
    "interestingly , the seemingly high - symmetry point @xmath45 has a relatively large number of irreducible representations of @xmath32 , which incurs more computation costs compared to , say , a diamond crystal with only 2 irreducible representations at @xmath45 .",
    "the 12-@xmath40 points correspond to a total of 471 irreducible representations .",
    "ignoring the cost for convergence tests , we already need to handle a minimum of @xmath46 irreducible representations to carry out a central - difference scheme for @xmath8 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 directions ( note that we need to perform a set of phonon calculations on the equilibrium structure ) .",
    "the cost analysis also suggests even larger computational resources will be required if one wishes to carry out a full direct minimization study based on the quasi - harmonic approximation in finding the free energy minimum at each temperature in the three - dimensional search space of @xmath47 . at the end of self - consistent - consistent calculations ,",

    "we apply strains of @xmath70 ( strains of @xmath71 do not change the results appreciably ) to obtain the central - difference grneisen  parameters in the @xmath8 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 directions . by using the change in the dynamical matrix resulting from a finite deformation to the crystal and with the help of first - order perturbation theory",

    "the results of @xmath72 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gru - para ] .",
    "it is noticed that along the high - symmetry directions , the degeneracy of the grneisen  parameters is preserved .",
    "there are some bands that have large values ( say , @xmath73 ) of grneisen  parameters . by performing a @xmath34-point sampling over the bz",
    ", we calculate the plain density of grneisen  parameters @xmath74 , results of which are shown on the right panels of fig .",

    "the @xmath75 plots show that large grneisen  parameters are not highly populated .",
    "interestingly , @xmath75 show some population of negative grneisen  parameters , especially for @xmath76 , which may lead to negative tecs if these negative parameters correspond to low - frequency modes . in the literature , one can use the average grneisen  parameters@xcite or the scattered @xmath77-@xmath1 plot@xcite to display this information .",
    "however , here we propose a quantity called the density of grneisen  parameters @xmath78 , weighted by the number of phonon modes , defined as @xmath79 to capture the collective effects of grneisen  parameters and phonon frequencies . apart from its direct physical meaning",

    "@xmath18 ( shown in an inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : tec ] ) also exhibits a largely similar temperature dependence . despite the occurrences of negative grneisen  parameters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gru - para ] , all linear and volumetric tecs are positive . at high temperatures ,",
    "the effect of phonon modes with negative grneisen  parameters is canceled out by the more highly populated phonon modes at lower frequencies with positive grneisen  parameters , thus eliminating the possibility of negative tecs at any temperature .",
    "the high - temperature limits are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90  k@xmath6 , and the volumetric tec is @xmath91  k@xmath6 .",
    "the small tec of @xmath9 among all other tecs is consistent with the fact that @xmath92 is smaller than @xmath93 and @xmath94 , in addition to the fact that @xmath95 is comparable to @xmath52 but larger than @xmath96 . to the best of our knowledge , the experimental tec data of sb@xmath2s@xmath3  are not readily available for a direct comparison .",
    "however , we note that stoffel _",
    "et al._@xcite have demonstrated that the volumetric tec of trigonal sb@xmath2te@xmath3  using a quasi - harmonic approximation is accurate up to 300  k where the mean - square displacements ( msds ) of sb@xmath2te@xmath3 , shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : msd ] compare rather well with that of sb@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "therefore we believe our tec results on sb@xmath2s@xmath3  are reasonable below 40  k. we note that the msds of sb@xmath2te@xmath3  at higher temperatures ( which are not available in ref .  [ ] ) may provide a better estimate on the temperature below which our tec results are valid . at low temperatures below @xmath97",

    "in summary we have extended the grneisen  formalism to treat a low - symmetry structure of orthorhombic antimony sulfide . using this approach",
    ", we applied just six deformations to the crystal to obtain the grneisen  parameters , thus avoiding the huge computation requirement for a direct minimization based on the quasi - harmonic approximation . even though negative grneisen  parameters were found , there are no negative tecs at all temperatures since these parameters are associated with high frequency modes at around @xmath82  cm@xmath6 .",
