    "non - coding rna ( ncrna ) has emerged in recent years as a major player in the molecular biology of the cell .",
    "the vast majority of transcripts in the cell produce long ( greater than 200 nucleotides ) non - coding rna , and many of their functions have been studied  @xcite .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite proposed that a function of much of the non - coding rna thought not to be under evolutionary constraint , was to act collectively to regulate protein transcription . instead of individual genes being controlled by a few regulatory elements , ncrna acts collectively to control transcription .",
    "if we assume weak binding of many species of ncrna to each other , the amount of unbound ncrna depends on all of the other species collectively .",
    "this free ncrna can then act to regulate mrna in a variety of possible ways .",
    "the important distinction between this behavior and other regulatory mechanisms , such as _ cis_-regulation , is the collective nature of regulation .    in computer science",
    ", it has been known for many decades , that it is possible to make intelligent computational decisions using _ distributed _ networks , and these form the bulk of models for artificial and real neural network  @xcite .",
    "this differs from most digital circuitry in that the output is computed using network elements that interact with many others in a robust way .",
    "this means that even if connection strengths are varied or even eliminated entirely , the network will still keep much of its original function .",
    "this is an advantage over traditional computer circuitry which has a much sparser connectivity . furthermore this architecture is well suited to learning new tasks .    in this paper",
    ", we devise a ncrna system that will behave as an _ associative memory_. the model behaves in a similar manner to associative memory neural networks  @xcite .",
    "there are two ingredients to this system : ( _ i ) _ a regulated mechanism to produce many species of ncrna molecules , that will degrade at some rate over time , ( _ ii ) _ the ncrna molecules bind and unbind with equilibrium constants that can be varied by changing the sequence of them .",
    "we assume that the regulation will depend on the total concentration of ncrna , and the amount of unbound ncrna .",
    "we find a specific functional form for the regulation of ncrna that leads to nonlinear self - consistent equations for unbound ncrna concentrations .",
    "these equations are essentially the same as what is used in associative memory models .",
    "there are three caveats to this scenario however .",
    "the first is that the relaxation time for the chemical equilibration of the ncrna is much shorter than the time it takes to degrade ncrna molecules .",
    "the second , is that we have given the mathematical form for the regulation of ncrna that depends on different ncrna concentrations , but we have not provided a physical or chemical model that can implement this precisely .",
    "similar regulation takes place but its precise form is still not understood well quantitatively .",
    "finally , it requires that we have complete freedom to choose the equilibrium constants between different species .    as with many neural network and statistical mechanical models ,",
    "the precise form of a model often does not matter  @xcite , and we expect that a range of models will have similar behavior",
    ". this model does not imply that precisely this biochemical mechanism exists , but rather it shows the existence of mechanisms that are relatively simple , and can result in collective regulation of the genome in a manner quite unlike the ones that have already been discovered .",
    "this work makes such a paradigm more plausible .",
    "here we study how regulating the transcription of @xmath0 species of non - coding rna ( ncrna ) , combined with the promiscuous binding of ncrna species to each other , can lead to an associative memory .",
    "we denote the total concentration of of the @xmath0 species by @xmath1 , and the unbound concentrations @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the standard form for chemical reactions between different species , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 @xmath5 we are assuming here that these are the only kinds of reaction present .",
    "there are no higher order reactions involving three or more species .",
    "we can define an equilibrium constant  @xcite @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the concentration of bound molecules @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to  @xcite @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "we further assume that we have complete freedom to choose the equilibrium constants .",
    "that is , there is enough choice in the sequences and binding positions of the rna molecules that the equilibrium constant of one pair does not influence another one .",
    "the concentration of an individual species of ncrna needs to be regulated for the mechanism described here to work .",
    "regulation is expected for biochemical processes , however we require more specifically that the regulation should depend on the current total concentration @xmath11 , _ as well as _ the concentration of unbound ncrna @xmath12 . @xmath12 can be measured with the assumption that only the unbound molecules will be able to bind to a particular rna binding biomolecule ( such as a protein ) involved in the regulation of this kind of ncrna .",
    "the total concentration @xmath11 , can be measured with the assumption that there is another biomolecule that binds to a different portion on the ncrna which is normally not associated with another rna molecule , for example because it is in a stem loop .",
    "an example of such a protein is a stem - loop binding protein ( slbp ) .",
    "if both unbound and bound ncrna concentrations are directly related to the concentrations of certain proteins that bind to them as suggested above , it would appear feasible that a complex of such proteins could evolve to produce transcription machinery that allows regulation in the way we hypothesize below .",
    "this seems reasonable because well known genetic regulatory mechanisms are well tuned to both enhance and suppress transcription .",
    "we are only requiring that individual components enhancing and suppressing transcription can be combined to mimic the smooth dependence on @xmath12 and @xmath11 that is used here .",
    "[ eq : concentrationmodification ] relates the unbound concentration of one species to its total concentration , and the unbound concentration of all the other species .",
    "the system will start off out of equilibrium and we assume that it approaches it with a simplified first order kinetic equation @xmath13 for @xmath10 , where @xmath14 is a relaxation time , giving the time scale for the relaxation of the @xmath15 s to equilibrium .    as discussed above , the concentrations @xmath16 are regulated .",
    "we assume that individual molecules degrade over a timescale @xmath17 , but are also being transcribed , leading to a non - zero steady state concentration .",
    "we assume that the degradation is a first order process , and the transcription of new ncrna molecules is a function that depends on @xmath16 and all of the @xmath12 s .",
    "@xmath18 physically we expect that @xmath19 , that is , the degradation of the rna happens at a much slower rate than equilibration of the binding and unbinding of rna .",
    "@xmath20 represents the rate at which new transcripts are being produced .",
    "this could be accomplished by regulating the transcription through a variety of means , such as repressors or coactivators that can sense unbound and bound concentrations as discussed above .",
    "we now choose a specific form of the function @xmath20 that will lead to an associative biochemical memory .",
    "@xmath21 for @xmath10 .",
    "the function @xmath22 is a sigmoid function that could take a variety of forms , such as a logit function @xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a constant , that in analogy to spin systems , represents an inverse temperature .",
    "we shall discuss its value below when we discuss the numerical implementation of this model .",
    "[ eq : firstorderrho ] , [ eq : firstorderc ] , [ eq : formoff ] , and [ eq : sigmoid ] define the dynamics of the @xmath25 concentrations given a set of equilibrium constants @xmath26 , and the initial conditions .",
    "in steady state , all time derivatives vanish , and eqs [ eq : firstorderrho ] reduces to [ eq : concentrationmodification ] .",
    "it can be rearranged to yield : @xmath27 eq . [ eq : firstorderc ] reduces to @xmath28 if we transform to symmetric variables @xmath29 , @xmath10 so that @xmath30 .",
    "we will also choose symmetrized variables @xmath31 so that @xmath32 substituting this into eq .",
    "[ eq : formoff ] and using eq .",
    "[ eq : kp ] gives @xmath33 canceling the @xmath16 s solving for @xmath29 , and substituting eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmoid ] finally gives @xmath34    note that there is no guarantee that the dynamics of this system will lead to these steady state solutions as some of these may be unstable .",
    "but for the physically sensible requirement that we have imposed on the relaxation times , we will see below that these solutions are achieved .",
    "this self consistent equation is used in analyzing neural network associative memories  @xcite and can have many solutions , depending on the choice of the @xmath35 s .",
    "we will now focus on the most common choice , that of hebbian learning  @xcite .",
    "we can choose the @xmath36 s or equivalently the @xmath35 s in a manner that will allow the network to retrieve @xmath37 patterns .",
    "the retrieval works best when the patterns are uncorrelated .",
    "let us denote the @xmath38th pattern by @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we let each @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 the number of patterns that can be reliably stored is proportional to @xmath0  @xcite but this will also depend on the correlations between the patterns .    in order for this choice to be physically meaningful , the @xmath36 s must all be positive .",
    "this is why we chose to relate the @xmath36 s to the @xmath35 s in the first place through eq .",
    "[ eq : jtok ] . after choosing @xmath37 patterns and setting the @xmath35 s accordingly ,",
    "they are shifted and scaled to produce positive @xmath36 s .",
    "@xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "this produces equilibrium constants between zero and one .",
    "the above model was implemented numerically .",
    "we chose @xmath45 ncrna species , and analyze the retrieval @xmath46 separate patterns using the hebbian rule of eq .",
    "[ eq : hebb ] .",
    "the ratio of the two timescales @xmath47 was found to be important in the convergence of this system . with @xmath48",
    "the system always appeared to converge . however with @xmath49 , it sometimes did not .",
    "we tested out the basin of attraction of initial values of the @xmath15 s .",
    "we considered each pattern @xmath50 and then randomly altered its sequence by varying amounts .",
    "for each ncrna species , we chose a random number between zero and 1 flipped the value of the density @xmath51 , if the random number was below some cutoff .",
    "we tried @xmath52 different mutations for each of the @xmath37 patterns , for a fixed cutoff .",
    "we generated @xmath53 separate examples of the @xmath37 patterns , and varied the cutoff .",
    "we plot the fraction of mistakes as a function of this cutoff in fig [ fig : mistakesvscutoff ] .",
    "the three graphs represents three different values of @xmath24 : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "it is evident that for @xmath24 equals @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , some patterns are not stable , because even with a cutoff of zero leads in some cases to the system moving away to a different pattern .",
    "however , with @xmath57 , all patterns were stable .",
    "next we tested out the effects of mutating the equilibrium constants @xmath26 .",
    "we chose random @xmath3 s and @xmath58 and mutated them by taking @xmath59 , maintaining symmetry of the matrix .",
    "( recall that @xmath60 ) .",
    "we measured how close the final fixed point was to the original pattern , by measuring the hamming distance between the two and dividing by @xmath0 .",
    "we varied the number of @xmath36 s that were mutated .",
    "we ran this for the same number of times as above , and for the same values of @xmath24 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "here we have developed and analyzed a model for ncrna that produces features of an associative memory which assumes promiscuous binding of many species to each other .",
    "we mapped the fixed points of this biochemical network onto a neural network model .",
    "however the stability of these points depends on two relaxation times , one for ncrna equilibration , and the other characterizing the degradation time of ncrna molecules .",
    "furthermore the switching on of ncrna transcription must be a sharp enough function of ncrna concentrations , that is , have high enough @xmath24 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmoid ] ) , for the fixed points to be stable .",
    "although an associative memory has been considered here mainly as a gross simplification of a real genetic network , in order to elucidate , in detail , how genetic networks could make use of collective regulation , it is possible that this kind of behavior could be useful in an organism . in a neural network , if some fraction of a pattern is shown to an associative memory , the rest of it will be reproduced .",
    "similarly for a genetic network , if some ncrna species are presented to the network at given concentrations , the network will recognize this sub-pattern \" , and produce the additional pattern of ncrna molecules at desired concentrations .",
    "multiple patterns can be stored , meaning that the network can respond appropriately to different environmental conditions .",
    "there are many advantages to distributed network computation and one would expect , as argued here , that these would carry over to networks used for genetic regulation .",
    "the robustness to mutation is one such feature .",
    "this means that mutations of ncrna will have a much gentler effect than for sparse networks , but nevertheless could confer evolutionary advantages .",
    "this is important because much ncrna is thought not to be under evolutionary constraint but in light of the above , this may be an incorrect conclusion .",
    "much larger mutation rates for molecules utilizing collective regulation are expected even if they are involved in important regulatory functions .",
    "therefore the mutation rate criteria for evolutionary pressure should be questioned to take this kind of collective mechanism .",
    "the robustness of collective regulations to changes also means that it is difficult to come up with experimental means to find it , as each pairwise interactions between species are small and removal of individual interactions will not be easily noticed .",
    "this model was not evolutionary , as this would make analysis intractable analytically .",
    "however it is straightforward to see how evolution would give rise to equilibrium constants that could store multiple patterns .",
    "indeed , this is the similar to what is done with ",
    "boltzmann machines \"  @xcite , where the network is trained with monte carlo on multiple patterns and eventually learns to respond to all of them correctly .",
    "the couplings will not end up being precisely those of eq .",
    "[ eq : hebb ] , but they will achieve the same goal .",
