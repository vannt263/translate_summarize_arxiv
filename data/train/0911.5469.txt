    "the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a macroscopic system driven out of equilibrium grows with time , and the dynamics of such a system is irreversible .",
    "the entropy of a mesoscopic system also grows in the long - time limit , but it may decrease over sufficiently short periods of time .",
    "hence , the entropy production @xmath0 during a time interval @xmath1 is a random variable , characterized by a distribution @xmath2 .",
    "the ` fluctuation theorem ' ( ft )  @xcite states that the probabilities of positive and negative entropy changes at sufficiently long @xmath1 are related by @xmath3 remarkably , this simple and universal relation remains valid even far from equilibrium .",
    "it has been proven for thermostated hamiltonian systems  @xcite , markovian stochastic processes  @xcite , quantum systems  @xcite , and mesoscopic conductors  @xcite .",
    "the ft is fundamentally important for transport theory .",
    "one of its consequences is the jarzynski equality  @xcite , which in turn leads to the 2nd law of thermodynamics .",
    "it also leads to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and onsager symmetry relations @xcite , as well as to their extensions to nonlinear transport  @xcite .",
    "the ft was first verified in an experiment measuring the distribution of the work done on a colloidal particle placed in a water flow and trapped by an optical tweezer  @xcite . by monitoring the position",
    "fluctuations it is possible to estimate the work done on the particle . for this classical experiment , as well as for other related ones performed at room temperature  @xcite , the thermal fluctuations are quite large and the ft has been confirmed .",
    "in contrast , experiments for mesoscopic quantum systems  @xcite were lacking until very recently  @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the implications of ft for mesoscopic systems .",
    "the first experimental test of the ft applied to single - electron transport has been performed recently in ref .",
    "a system of two coupled quantum dots in a 2deg at the gaas / algaas interface was operated in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "( the single - electron charging energy of a single dot was of the order of 100 @xmath4ev , and the sample was cooled to 100 milli - kelvin . )",
    "the single - electron tunneling through the double dot system was detected via the current through a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "the time resolution of the readout was better than 0.1 ms . by using an asymmetric setup the direction of tunneling",
    "could be resolved , and the probability distribution of forward and backward tunneling processes could be determined .    the entropy production in this experiment is related to joule heating and reads @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of electrons ( with charge @xmath7 ) transfered through the conductor during time @xmath1 and @xmath8 is the bias voltage .",
    "hence the ft can be formulated in terms of the distribution of transfered charge @xmath9 at sufficiently long times , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the current , as follows @xmath12 unlike in classical systems , the fluctuations of the charge transfered through the quantum dots are strongly affected by the environment ( phonons and electromagnetic environment ) and by the measurement backaction . in what follows",
    "we discuss various environmental effects and demonstrate their importance for the interpretation of the experiment .",
    "we show that the non - equilibrium electromagnetic fluctuations caused by the non - equilibrium shot noise of the qpc detector lead to an apparent violation of the ft . however , we find the ft to be satisfied if we replace the temperature @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ pft ] ) by an enhanced effective temperature @xmath14 , which we relate to the tunneling rates for the various relevant processes .",
    "we also study the effect of finite bandwidth of the detector  @xcite and show that in the parameter regime of our experiment , this effect may also be accounted for by an effective temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : et ] , we briefly discuss the experimental results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fts ] , we discuss the theory relevant for our experiment assuming a perfect detector . in sec .",
    "[ sec : be ] , we discuss the effect of the environment .",
    "the realistic case , where the time resolution of the detector is limited by its bandwidth , will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite ] .",
    "there we will show that it is still possible to recover the ft with properly corrected tunneling rates . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wtd ] , we show how the tunneling rates are determined experimentally and how the finite bandwidth of the detector affects the experimentally obtained value .",
    "section  [ sec : sum ] summarizes our discussion .",
    "most of the experiments on single - electron counting are performed with a single quantum dot capacitively coupled to a qpc detector @xcite . in this case",
    "the qpc current switches between the two values corresponding to an occupied and an empty quantum dot . such a detector can not resolve the direction of the electron tunneling and ,",
    "therefore , is not suitable for testing the ft .",
    "the simplest system which does resolve the direction of the tunneling consists of two serially coupled quantum dots which are asymmetrically coupled to a qpc detector  @xcite ( fig . [ figsetups ] a ) .",
    "the left and right gate voltages , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , applied to the quantum dots are tuned in such a way that only three charge states of the dqd need to be considered . in the experiment",
    "@xcite those states are @xmath17 ( both dots are occupied ) , @xmath18 ( left dot is occupied by one electron ) and @xmath19 ( right dot is occupied ) .",
    "accordingly , the current through the qpc , which is coupled asymmetrically to the dqd , switches between three different values ( fig .  [ figsetups ]",
    "this setup allows distinguishing electron tunneling in different directions and between the dots and leads .    from the time trace of",

    "electrons tunnel through the dots sequentially .",
    "the system is then fully characterized by the vector of the occupation probabilities of the dqd charge states , @xmath30 , which satisfies the following master equation @xmath31 here the transition matrix is given by , @xmath32 figure  [ fig : mc1 ] indicates six transitions with @xmath33 between three charge states .",

    "the phonon and electromagnetic environments , as well as the nonequilibrium qpc current noise generate qd level fluctuations , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "in order to describe the experiment and the consequences for the ft we calculate the cumulant generating function .",
    "we introduce the master equation of the total system , @xmath119 where the transition matrix is a @xmath120 matrix , @xmath121 with sub - matrices given by @xmath122 note that the counting field is associated with the rate @xmath114 .",
    "i.e. , in the present model the switching of the qpc current are counted and not the transitions in the dqd system .",
