    "it is now widely accepted that quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) are powered by accretion onto a massive black hole ( mbh ) within a galaxy .",
    "while mbhs are commonly found in galaxies , qsos require the central black hole to be fed by a steady supply of matter .",
    "characterization of the host galaxies of qsos can provide important clues to understand both the formation mechanisms and the evolution of qsos .",
    "observations of low - z qsos offer the obvious advantage of increased resolution and sensitivity for accurately measuring host properties , and relatively large samples are required to both adequately probe the full range of host properties and to explore possible relationships between host type and properties of the qso nucleus .",
    "the pioneering optical surveys of low - z qsos in the mid 1980 s , using 4m - class telescopes @xcite , produced several common themes , as well as enigmatic problems that still remain today .",
    "qsos were found typically to live in luminous ( @xmath16 ) hosts , with a mixture of host types ( spirals , barred - spirals , ellipticals ) , including a significant fraction of disturbed and/or strongly - interacting systems .",
    "there was also some hint of a trend in host type with host luminosity , with spirals and luminous ellipticals favored at the low and high end , respectively , of the range of qso luminosities .",
    "however , it often proved difficult to distinguish reliably between different host types , often due to poor sensitivity or angular resolution or both ; in addition , the mixture of objects being observed was abnormally weighted toward radio - loud and/or x - ray selected objects despite these objects being only a small fraction of the predominant radio - quiet population .",
    "optical qso surveys with _",
    "@xcite offered dramatically improved resolution , but for the most part contained similar biases toward radio - loud objects , resulting in a preponderance of ellipticals . in the end",
    ", results from the _ hst _ surveys did not significantly modify earlier conclusions based on the ground - based surveys .",
    "more recent surveys of qso hosts have favored the near - infrared , where the fraction of the observed light due to the underlying host galaxy is largest , and ground - based seeing can rival that from _ hst_. important large near - infrared qso surveys include those from the ground with 2/4m - class telescopes @xcite and , more recently , those exploiting adaptive optics ( ao ) @xcite , and , finally , those using _",
    "@xcite . of most relevance to our own current work are the near - infrared observations by mcleod and co - workers who have imaged the host galaxies for a large volume - limited sample of optically - selected qsos from the pgbqs similar to the sample and selection criteria we have used .",
    "other near - infrared surveys of qsos include studies with nearly equal mixtures of radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and studies of  far - infrared - excess \" qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of the near - infrared surveys generally agree with previous optical surveys in finding that qsos typically reside in luminous ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) hosts , and that spirals represent an increasing fraction of hosts at lower qso luminosities .",
    "however , the near - infrared surveys still emphasize the overall diversity of host types , and they are still plagued by difficulties with the accurate determination of radial profiles due to a combination of problems including bad seeing , unstable psf , and ultimately the faintness of the hosts at large radii .    finally , it has now become clear that optically - selected qsos may be rivaled in their numbers by newly discovered populations of near - infrared selected @xcite , and far - infrared selected @xcite qsos .",
    "it is extremely intriguing that a very high fraction ( @xmath17% ) of the former show evidence of tidal interactions @xcite , and nearly all of the latter are found to be major mergers of large gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these new findings raise the obvious questions of possible evolutionary connections between these different classes of objects , all of which seem to be capable of producing luminous qsos .",
    "it thus became clear to us that it might prove extremely useful to revisit the properties of optically - selected qso hosts and to search for trends in host type with other properties such as far - infrared luminosity and color , which might then prove useful in future studies designed to explore possible connections between the familiar optically - selected qso population and the various types of infrared - selected qsos .",
    "the availability of ao systems on 810 m class telescopes provides a potentially important new capability for accurately measuring the distribution of light in the host galaxy of qsos .",
    "in particular , our access to relatively large amounts of observing time using the new university of hawaii near - infrared ao system , hokupaa , on mauna kea , allowed us to carefully design a sensitive and relatively uniform survey , primarily at _",
    "h_-band , of a large representative sample of low - z qsos randomly selected from the optical ( _ b_-band ) pgbqs .",
    "the sample was made large enough to include a representative sub - sample of the minority population of radio - loud objects , as well as to allow for adequate sampling of a wide range of qso luminosities , but was otherwise unbiased .",
    "an additional bonus for our new observations was the existence by 2003 of relatively complete and accurate spectral - energy - distributions ( seds ) from radio - to - xray wavelengths @xcite , including most importantly , new far - infrared fluxes for most of our targets , which were recently determined from reprocessed _ iras _ and _ iso _ data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the first near - infrared imaging study of a large number of qsos ( 32 objects ) made with ao systems on the gemini 8.2 m and subaru 8.1 m telescopes on mauna kea .",
    "we first describe , in  [ sec : sample ] how our sample was selected . the observations and data reduction techniques",

    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses how host type depends on other properties of the qso ( e.g. degree of disturbance , radio loudness , the near - infrared absolute luminosity of the host , and the total far - infrared luminosity ) , and compares our results with previous studies .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : conclusions ] .    as background to our current work ,",
    "good brief reviews of previous problems and subtleties associated with interpreting the host types of low - z qsos can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , a more thorough review of the wide range of qso host studies  their consensus and differences  including theories as to the origin and evolution of qsos and their possible relation to other types of extragalactic objects , can be found in the proceedings of three recent workshops specifically devoted to the study of qso hosts @xcite .",
    "the performance of ao systems is a strong function of the photon flux seen by the wavefront sensor ( wfs ) .",
    "although the hokupaa ( the institute for astronomy ao system @xcite in use on the gemini north telescope from mid-2000 to mid-2002 ) and subaru ao @xcite systems can `` lock '' onto objects as faint as @xmath18 under good seeing , only very partial wavefront correction can be achieved for such faint objects .",
    "to ensure reasonably good image quality ( fwhm@xmath19 ) , our sample was limited to bright qsos ( approximately @xmath20 ) .",
    "this observational constraint would result in a strong bias towards intrinsically highly luminous qsos if the sample were not redshift - limited .",
    "moreover , observation of higher redshift qsos is made more difficult for the purpose of this work by the decrease in spatial resolution , and especially surface brightness , with increasing distance .",
    "our sample is hence limited to @xmath21 .",
    "the ideal sample for our current observations proved to be the palomar - green bright quasar sample ( bqs : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although there are more recent and larger qso surveys , the bqs still contains the majority of the nearest and brightest optically - selected , uv - excess qsos for study from the northern sky , and its magnitude limit was close to our desired brightness limit for good ao performance .",
    "there are also extensive multi - wavelength observations in the literature for the bqs sample , which potentially allows us to further explore the relationship of the qso host properties to other properties of the qso .",
    "the bqs contains 92 qsos with @xmath22 ( in the @xmath23 cosmology used in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the 10,714 deg@xmath24 surveyed region of the sky at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "forty - seven of these qsos met our final redshift and brightness selection criteria ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , of which we were eventually able to observe 58% ( 28/47 ) during our two year observing campaign on mauna kea .",
    "these 28 qsos from the bqs were essentially selected at random from the complete sub - sample of 47 , depending only of the ra range observable during each observing run .",
    "four additional objects were eventually added to the list of 28 , bringing the total number of observed targets to 32 .",
    "two objects from the bqs with @xmath29 ( pg1119 + 120 and pg 1126 - 041 ) were successfully observed during one of the earliest observing runs , while we were still defining the scope of the overall ao campaign . rather than discard the data , we decided to include these objects here for two reasons .",
    "first they allow us to further explore the low luminosity end of the qso sample , and second , we noted early on that the uncertainties in the @xmath10-band magnitudes listed in the original bqs are large enough such that these two objects might have properly been in our sample .",
    "two additional objects were added to our observing list in the latter half of our overall campaign , when it was realized that we had only two `` bona - fide '' radio - loud qsos ( rlqs ) in our list of observed objects .",
    "one of these rlqs , 4c31.63 ( @xmath30 ) , was at the time it was added , the highest redshift object observed , but still within our planned redshift limit for the survey , and its @xmath10-band magnitude was above the average overall threshold for the bqs .",
    "the second rlq , pg2251 + 113 ( @xmath31 ) , was above our stated redshift cutoff , but satisfied our @xmath10-band limit and was the only rlq from the bqs that could be observed at the ra range available for observations during 2001 , september .",
    "the addition of these two rlqs allowed us to bring the total fraction of rlqs in our observed sample ( @xmath32 ) up to the ratios more typically found ( i.e. , @xmath215% ) in large qso surveys .",
    "the complete list of our 32 observed targets is given in table 1 ( vega magnitudes are used in this table and throughout this paper ) .",
    "the listed @xmath10-band magnitudes have been updated where possible with newer more accurate values than originally given in @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are also updated to an @xmath33 , cosmology : the @xmath34 qso criteria used by @xcite now corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "we note that the updated @xmath10-band magnitudes resulted in three additional objects , pg0838 + 770 , pg0844 + 349 and pg1229 + 204 , falling below the absolute magnitude cutoff , bringing the total number of lower luminosity objects to five .",
    "both the hokupaa ao system , built by the university of hawaii and used on the gemini north telescope , and the subaru telescope ao system , were used for this project . for both systems ,",
    "a 36-element curvature sensor is used with a 36-element bimorph mirror .",
    "curvature ao systems are traditionally very efficient on faint targets , partly thanks to the use of photon - counting devices ( avalanche photo diodes ) with no readout noise .",
    "this allows these systems to guide on @xmath36 sources and to routinely provide good correction ( better than 02 ) on @xmath37 point sources , which makes them well suited for qso host galaxy imaging .",
    "the ao - corrected beam was fed to quirc for gemini and to ircs for subaru .",
    "both cameras use @xmath38 detectors for near - ir imaging .",
    "the contrast between the qso and a typical host galaxy is better ( lower ) at about 1 @xmath39 m ( in the rest frame ) than either in the visible or the longer infrared wavelengths .",
    "this is largely due to a local minimum near 1 @xmath39 m in the rest - frame radio - to - xray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of nearly all qsos , both rlqs and rqqs , except for the strongly beamed blazars  e.g . ,",
    ".  2 of @xcite , and also fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the performance of ao systems is optimal in the near infrared : at shorter wavelengths , the number of actuators is too small to sample the wavefront properly . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the high thermal background precludes the observation of low - surface - brightness sources , and the diffraction limit of the telescope restricts the achievable angular resolution .",
    "observations in the near - ir are therefore well - suited for qso host studies from the ground .",
    "the seeing was constantly estimated during the observations by image quality monitoring and monitoring of the control signals of the ao system .",
    "most of the observations were made using the @xmath0 filter , which provides the optimal resolution under good seeing conditions . when the seeing was bad ( corrected fwhm in @xmath0 band larger than 02 ) , the @xmath40 filter was preferred to the @xmath0 filter , and usually allowed high resolution imaging ( fwhm@xmath19 ) even under worse than average seeing , but at the expense of a stronger thermal background .",
    "a few observations were done in the @xmath41 band on exceptionally good nights .",
    "fainter qsos were preferentially observed under good seeing conditions , to avoid running out of bright targets when the seeing was average or worse than average .",
    "these precautions resulted in a surprisingly homogeneous set of images ( angular resolution about 015 ) considering the wide range of seeing conditions and qso magnitudes of the sample .",
    "table 2 gives the complete summary of our observing log for all of the data that are presented in this paper , including filter , exposure times , seeing ( fwhm ) , and telescope used .",
    "twenty - six objects were eventually observed at @xmath0 , and 8 of these 26 were also observed at either @xmath41 or @xmath40 , or both .",
    "four objects were observed at @xmath40 only , one at @xmath41 only , and one at both @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "twenty - eight objects were observed at gemini , and four objects were observed at the end of our campaign ( feb , 2003 ) using subaru .      for each target , a list of about six psf candidates , all within a few arcminutes of the quasar , was prepared prior to observations .",
    "each of those was briefly observed ( without closing the ao loop ) to test if it could , with the help of the wfs neutral density filter set , reproduce the wfs photon counts generated by the quasar .",
    "this allowed us to match the photon counts of the quasar to within 10% for most of the objects in our sample .",
    "the ao loop parameters ( membrane stroke and loop gain ) were not modified between observations of the target and the psf .    for most of the targets ,",
    "the psf total integration time was much smaller than the qso total integration time . because of the variability of the psf presented in ",
    "[ sec : psfstab ] , the residuals of the psf subtraction are limited by effects that do not average well with time , and there is little gain in observing the psf star for longer than a few minutes . however , long exposure times are required to record the faint structure of the host galaxy that are outside the central part of the psf , where psf subtraction is not essential ( where the psf wings are fainter than the host galaxy ) . when possible , the psf star was observed with the same frame integration time as the qso to use the psf frames for sky extraction .      in this section ,",
    "we characterize the psfs delivered by gemini+hokupaa and the subaru ao system and investigate their variability .",
    "this preliminary work is essential for attempting the characterization of the qso hosts in our data .",
    "the psf delivered by an ao system is a function of :    * * 1 .",
    "guide star v magnitude and color of the object imaged .",
    "* the brightness of the star , as seen by the wfs , strongly affects the performance of the ao system . due to the wavelength - dependence of the seeing ( and the optics of the camera ) , psfs are also expected to be color - dependant . * * 2 .",
    "atmospheric seeing . * under poor seeing conditions , the fwhm of the corrected psf is larger .",
    "in addition , the brightness of the large halo surrounding the psf core increases with the turbulence . *",
    "* 3 . instrumental variables .",
    "* wind - powered telescope shake , change in the optical path , and the primary and secondary mirror wavefront all modify the psf . * * 4 .",
    "ao loop parameters .",
    "* loop gain and membrane stroke ( for curvature systems ) set the speed of the ao loop and the optical gain of the wfs respectively , and therefore affect the psf .    despite efforts to match the brightness ( as seen by the wfs ) of the reference psf and the qso , small discrepancies in the two flux levels are unavoidable .",
    "more importantly , we found that the variations in seeing always limit the accuracy of the psf subtraction when the flux of the psf and the qso are matched to better than 10% .",
    "figure [ fig : psfcmpprof ] shows how the radial profile of the psf can change rapidly ( timescale of about a minute ) due to seeing variations .",
    "the far wings of the psf ( 1  to 2  in fig .",
    "[ fig : psfcmpprof ] ) show how much light is scattered by small - scale turbulence ( high spatial frequencies of the seeing ) , which is not corrected by the ao system . in this figure",
    ", it can be seen that these wings are much higher for psf1 than for psf2 .",
    "consequently , because the turbulence was stronger during the acquisition of psf1 , the ao correction is poorer and , inward of about 02 ( dotted vertical line ) , the surface brightness of the psf is lower .",
    "the `` crossing point , '' for which the loss of surface brightness due to the poor ao correction exactly equals the gain of surface brightness due to the increased scattering by small - scale turbulence , is set by the number of actuators of the ao system .",
    "the surface brightness at this crossing point is insensitive to seeing variations .",
    "figure [ fig : psfcmpprof ] also shows how the brightness of the psf affects its radial profile : for brighter psfs , the ao correction is better and flux is taken from an `` intermediate '' annulus between 01 and 03 and put into the central diffraction core of the psf .",
    "the far wings of the psf are left unchanged because of the limited number of actuators of the ao system . during real observation ,",
    "a combination of psf variations due to changing seeing and different source brightness will affect the radial profile .",
    "although the observer has no control over the seeing , it is possible to reduce psf variations by avoiding any change in the instrument during observations .",
    "for example , the ao loop parameters should be kept constant . during this observing program",
    ", it was discovered that the psf stability could be significantly improved by turning off the cassegrain rotator of the telescope . at the gemini and subaru telescopes , which have alt - azimuth mounts ,",
    "the cassegrain units carrying the ao systems are usually rotated to preserve the field orientation on the detector .",
    "the primary and secondary mirror create static wavefront aberrations .",
    "if these static aberrations are rotating in front of the ao system , which has preferential directions due to the geometry of the actuators and also introduces some higher order aberrations , the resulting rotational shear between the incoming wavefront and the aberrations of the ao system changes the structure of the psf .",
    "this very complex psf variation is difficult to predict since the individual sources of aberrations are poorly known .",
    "figure [ fig : rot ] illustrates this effect through the comparison of two differenced psfs , one for which the cassegrain rotator angle was kept unchanged between the two exposures , and the other for which a 15@xmath42 rotation occurred between the two exposures . because some of the aberrations come from the primary and secondary mirror and some come from the ao system and the camera , a psf obtained after rotation of the cassegrain rotator",
    "can not be reproduced by a rotation of a psf obtained at a different cassegrain rotator angle .",
    "we have seen above that turning off the cassegrain rotator makes the psf more stable and therefore , improves the accuracy of the psf subtraction .",
    "there is a second advantage to this technique : the psf and the image of the host galaxy can be decoupled through differential rotation .",
    "when attempting to detect faint structures very close to the qso , we are usually very sensitive to small variations in the psf structure , such as `` flares '' of the psf .",
    "these `` flares '' are more frequent when observing faint targets such as qsos , because the limited number of incoming photons does nt allow fast recovery from events such as a wind - induced telescope shake .",
    "it is possible to encounter such a flare on the object and not on the reference psf , leading to the false detection of a structure in the host galaxy .",
    "careful visual examination of individual frames can help detecting these artifacts but is not fully reliable .",
    "when observing with the cassegrain rotator off , the psf has a constant orientation on the detector while the object rotates , which unambiguously decouples the object from the psf variations . for a `` flare '' to be misidentified as a structure in the host galaxy , it would need to rotate in the psf at a speed reproducing the field rotation . because we observed most objects continuously for more than an hour",
    ", the total rotation during the observation is usually sufficient to efficiently decouple the object from the psf .    because of the improved psf stability when observing without the field derotator ,",
    "most of our observations were done with the cassegrain rotator turned off .",
    "the geographical coordinates of the telescope , the ut time of the exposure , the coordinates of the target and the angle of the cassegrain rotator are required , for each exposure , to recover the field orientation .",
    "this observing mode requires the exposure time to be short enough to avoid rotational smearing of the image .",
    "the limit we set on the rotational smearing corresponds to half a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at the edge of the detector when the target is at the center .",
    "this limit allows exposure times of 20 s to 30 s on most of the sky .    for some objects ,",
    "detector saturation was reached in a few seconds . because of the relatively long readout time of the camera ( 10 s ) on gemini / hokupaa , we chose to obtain a series of short unsaturated exposures and a series of longer exposures which were essential to reach a good flux sensitivity .",
    "we were careful to obtain the longer exposures when the field rotation was slow .",
    "ao psfs are time - variable and have relatively strong and extended wings compared with _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) psfs , but the image of the underlying host is made sharp , which allows accurate retrieval of the radial profile in regions where the wings of the central psf are not significantly brighter than the host galaxy .",
    "depending on the objects of our sample , we find that it is possible to accurately recover the host radial profile outward of about 02 ( for hosts which account for a large fraction of the total flux ) to 2",
    "( for hosts which are much fainter than the central point source ) with classical psf subtraction techniques .",
    "this corresponds to about 0.5 kpc to 2 kpc for most of the objects in the sample .",
    "thanks to the large collecting area of 8 m class telescopes , the host radial profile can usually be recovered to up to 5  to 10 . beyond this angular separation ,",
    "the error due to imperfect sky subtraction becomes larger than the host : due to the small field of view of the images , the sky level can not be accurately decoupled from the faint outer part of the host galaxy .    the good angular resolution ( 01 to 02 , which is comparable to or better than that of _ hst _ at the same wavelength ) and depth of qso images obtained on a 8 m class telescope equipped with an ao system makes it possible to image small and faint structures in the host .",
    "this is very important for this project , which relies on the ability to characterize the morphology of the host beyond the disk vs. elliptical galaxy classification .      for each target ,",
    "the frames were processed and coadded by a data reduction pipeline written in c. flat field and bad pixel maps were created from a set of dome flat exposures with increasing exposure time .",
    "the sky frame was obtained from the dithered qso and nearby psf exposures .",
    "the persistence effect of the detector was corrected for by ignoring the pixels that have been recently strongly exposed to light .",
    "an empirical formula was used to select such pixels from the pixel value and the time of the exposure of the 10 preceding frames .",
    "the first steps described above ( flat fielding , bad pixel identification and sky subtraction ) were applied to both the psf and the qso frames . for each qso ,",
    "a coadded image was generated by derotating each qso frame before coaddition .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exposuremap ] , because of the combination of dithers , rotations and bad pixels masking ( or pixels ignored due to the persistence of the detector ) , the total exposure time varies across the final image .",
    "a reference psf frame is obtained through coaddition of individual psf frames , but without field derotation . to avoid increasing the noise of the psf - subtracted image , the far wings of the psf were replaced by synthetic psf wings generated from a fit of the wings radial profile .",
    "the psf image matching the coadded qso image was obtained by coadding multiple copies of the reference psf frame with the proper rotation angles and relative exposure times .",
    "images are shown in figure [ fig : qsoimages1 ] for each object of our sample .",
    "the flux in the raw images ( left ) is dominated by the bright central nucleus , although the host galaxy is usually visible without psf subtraction , thanks to the good contrast and high angular resolution delivered by ao . the psf - subtracted images ( middle )",
    "reveal more host galaxy details , especially in the central part of the image .",
    "the quality of the psf subtraction is highly variable through the sample , and depends upon many factors ( see  [ sec : psfstab ] ) . in some cases ,",
    "the reference psf used for subtraction is less peaked ( and , therefore , has a comparatively brighter `` halo '' component ) than the actual psf during observation .",
    "if the host galaxy vs central nucleus luminosity ratio is low , the residual of the psf subtraction is then negative in an annulus surrounding the positive residual at the center of the image ( see  [ sec:2dana ] for a description of the 2-d analysis algorithm used to subtract the psf ) : this effect can be seen on pg0026 + 129 , pg0838 + 770 , pg1411 + 442 .",
    "psf subtraction errors due to poor stability of the ao control also occur when the source is faint , the atmospheric turbulence is strong and/or clouds vary the source brightness during the observation .",
    "these effects are responsible for the poor psf subtraction of pg0050 + 124 , pg1116 + 215 and pg1302@xmath5102 . during the observation of pg1617 + 175 , an avalanche photodiode of the ao wavefront sensor burned out , suddenly creating a bright extension in the psf delivered by the system , as can be seen in the psf subtracted image .",
    "many of the images also show artefacts due to sky subtraction residuals .",
    "these features are usually faint and beyond 5  from the qso .",
    "they are most visible in the images of pg0804 + 761 ( curved feature 4  north - west of the qso and compact artefacts 10  due east , north , west and south of the qso ) , pg0838 + 770 ( about 5  to 7  south of the qso ) , pg0844 + 349 ( straight edge and extended feature 6  east of the qso ) , pg0923 + 201 ( straight feature running north - south about 5  east of the qso ) , pg1001 + 054 ( faint extended fringes 5  to 10  south of the qso ) , pg1119 + 120 ( faint extended fringes mostly in 10  south - west of the qso ) , pg1307 + 085 ( 4 faint features in a 10  square pattern centered on the qso ) , pg1626 + 554 ( wide 5-radius arc centered in the qso , mostly visible in the northern half of the image ) and pg2214 + 139 ( faint broad features in a 8  square pattern centered on the qso ) .",
    "the flux within a 55 diameter circular aperture centered on the qso was measured for each object , with an accuracy of about @xmath435% at the 1 @xmath44 confidence level .",
    "this aperture size allows easy comparison with previous measurements by @xcite and @xcite . for the objects observed in non - photometric conditions , only a lower limit for this flux",
    "could be determined .",
    "table [ tab : photom ] compares our photometry with other measurements from the literature and from the 2mass archive .",
    "no correction was applied to account for differences between the 2mass @xmath45 and mauna kea @xmath40 photometric systems , as these two filters are very similar @xcite .",
    "the values shown in table [ tab : photom ] are consistent with previous findings that show that many of the qsos observed in this sample appear to show some variability in the near - infrared .",
    "the amplitude of variability shown in this table is in good agreement with @xcite : both sets of data identify pg1001 + 054 , pg1426 + 015 , pg1613 + 658 , pg1617 + 175 and pg2130 + 099 as the most variable qsos of our sample .",
    "since the observations made under non - photometric conditions need to be calibrated with other photometric measurements of the same object , the variability of qsos can cause errors in the estimate of the host galaxy luminosity . in order to minimize such errors ,",
    "the time difference between our observations and the photometric measurement should be kept small .",
    "2mass measurements , rather than older measurements from @xcite or @xcite , were therefore used for photometric calibration of objects for which no reliable photometry could be derived with our observations .",
    "in one case ( pg1116 + 215 ) , the lower limit obtained with our data is higher than the 2mass measurement : this lower limit was then adopted for photometric calibration .",

    "what does seem to be significant from fig .",
    "[ fig : mbvsmh_class ] is that even the most luminous galaxies with disks do not seem to harbor really luminous qsos .",
    "it would seem that it may be necessary to have a merger violent enough to completely destroy the disks of the progenitor galaxies to produce the most luminous qsos .",
    "the number of radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) in our sample is relatively small ( 5/28 = 18% ) , but it is representative of the fraction found in previous studies of large samples of qsos , which show that rlqs are only @xmath215% of the total population of optically - selected qsos . although we did not specifically distinguish rlqs and rqqs when computing mean host @xmath0-band luminosities for different  host types \" in table [ tab : hostclassstatnir ] , the rlq hosts are explicitly identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : hosttype][fig : mbvsmh_class ] .",
    "it is immediately obvious that rlqs live in the most luminous qsos ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) with the most luminous hosts ( i.e. , @xmath99 corresponding to @xmath100@xmath4 ) .",
    "these facts , coupled with our previously discussed trends of host type with qso @xmath10-band and host @xmath0-band luminosity , are consistent with previous published results which claim that rlqs are typically 1 - 2 mags more luminous than rqqs in the optical , and that rlqs are exclusively found in elliptical hosts , which in turn are usually much more luminous  typically 1 - 2 magnitudes , depending on whether the observations are in the optical or near - infrared , respectively  than the mean values found for the hosts of rqqs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the origin of the observed dichotomy in the mean properties of rlq and rqq hosts is somewhat beyond the scope of our current study , it is nevertheless worth restating the obvious  that qso surveys biased toward radio - selected objects will necessarily find more luminous , elliptical hosts when compared with pure optically selected samples of qsos .",
    "one of the expected strengths of ao observations of qsos using 8 m telescopes was the ability to better characterize the  host type \" , and in addition to detect faint extended structure in the host which may have escaped detection in previous imaging observations with smaller telescopes .",
    "although the majority of our host classifications are in general agreement with previous results ( see  [ sec : notes ] ) , our images were more likely to allow us to distinguish asymmetric features ( e.g. putative tidal debris , central bars , etc . ) from , for example , more symmetric spiral structure , and to better separate out compact , circumnuclear structures from the bright qso nucleus .",
    "we note that since we rely on morphological features such as tidal arms to classify hosts as `` not disturbed '' , `` disturbed '' or `` strongly disturbed '' , this classification is relatively insensitive to usually very symmetrical psf subtraction residuals .",
    "for example , the host type of pg 1626 + 554 and pg 2251 + 113 are unknown due to poor psf subtraction , but the smooth host images obtained lead us to classify them as `` not disturbed '' .    according to our analysis , 30% ( 9/30 ) of the classified qso hosts",
    "were categorized as being  disturbed \" or  strongly disturbed \" in table [ tab : hostclass ] .",
    "the 6 hosts classified as  strongly disturbed \" show asymmetric features reminiscent of tidal structure , as might be due , for example , to the advanced merger of two spiral disks .",

    "the three additional objects listed as  disturbed \" generally show fainter asymmetric features , ( plausibly faint tidal debris ) whose effect on the 1-d radial profile is small enough to still allow us to distinguish between different host types .",
    "the 4  disturbed \" hosts include two `` d@xmath56 '' and one `` e '' .    in addition to the 9 hosts classified as either  disturbed \" or  strongly disturbed \" , there are 3 hosts that were found to have a prominent well - defined bar , whose size in each case was @xmath25kpc radius . in two of these cases",
    "the bar actually dominated the integrated luminosity of the host .",
    "the hosts of two of these barred galaxies ( pg0804 + 761 , pg1001 + 054 ) , were classified as having a dominant disk profile (  d@xmath56 \" ) , while the third ( pg1229 + 204 ) , was classified as  b+d \" .",
    "it is unclear whether these bars have any relation to the processes that produced the putative tidal features in the  disturbed \" and  strongly disturbed \" hosts , but if they do , then the percentage of such hosts rises to 40% ( 12/30 ) .",

    "in addition to asymmetric structures , we also found a small , bright knot in the inner disks of 9 hosts ( see notes in table [ tab : hostclass ] ) .",
    "these knots were typically within a few kpc ( projected distance ) of the qso .",
    "they are being discussed here since we believe that the evidence points to the knots being associated directly with the host galaxy , as opposed , for example , to being projected foreground or background objects at much larger distances from the qso .",
    "the terms  companion \" or  close companion \" have been widely used in the literature to describe a range of distance scales around qsos where _ galaxies _ at the same redshift as the qso are found .",
    "for example comparative studies of the environment around qsos typically find that , at low redshifts , qsos live in regions of moderate galaxy overdensity , typical of compact or small groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "closer in , typically within a projected nuclear separation of @xmath102kpc between the companion and qso nuclei , are numerous reports of close companion galaxies , clearly distinguishable as a separate galaxy , but often with reported evidence of a tidal interaction with the qso host ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at the closest distances ( typically nuclear separations @xmath103kpc ) , where the putative close companion galaxy strongly overlaps the qso host , as is the case in most of the strongly disturbed systems , including our own , the close companion is then plausibly the second object involved in an advanced merger with the qso host .",
    "this last case is similar to what is meant here by the term  close companion \" , except in our case we also clearly distinguish a relatively bright  compact knot \" which could either be the nucleus of the companion galaxy , _ or _ possibly a super star - cluster , perhaps triggered by the merger .",
    "we have referred to these objects ( the ones within 10kpc projected separation ) as  close compact companions \" even though redshift is available for only one of the 9  knots \" , since it is likely that these  knots \" are indeed at the same redshift as the qso rather than simply being unrelated foreground or background objects .",
    "five of the 9 qso hosts with ",
    "close compact companions \" are the same 5 hosts classified as being  strongly disturbed \" , and one of the remaining four is classified as being  disturbed \" .",
    "several of the companions are also observed to be strongly elongated ( e.g. , in pg 1119 + 120 , pg 1411 + 441 , pg 1426 + 215 , pg 2349@xmath5014 ) .",
    "these facts strongly suggest that the knots are directly related to a merger event .",
    "however we remain somewhat agnostic whether these objects represent the second nucleus of a nearly merged galaxy pair , or , instead , a super star cluster perhaps triggered by the merger .",
    "although , the  knots \" appear to be too bright to be  normal \" star - formation knots , and are therefore good candidates to be distinct galaxy nuclei , they are in fact similar in brightness to the putative  super star cluster \" knots that have often been found in the circumnuclear regions of  infrared - excess qsos \" ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that appear to be nearly ubiquitous in the inner disks of  warm ultraluminous infrared galaxies \" ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all but one of the  knots \" seen in our current qso sample have measured @xmath77 in the range @xmath104 to @xmath105 , and in each case this translates into an absolute @xmath0-band luminosity in the range 3.55.5mag fainter than the host galaxy , and the most luminous knot ( @xmath106 ) , is still 3.3mag fainter than its host ( pg1302@xmath5102 ) , and is still within the upper range of luminosities observed for the star forming knots in  warm uligs \" .",
    "in addition to trying to better categorize the host types for our sample of qsos , we were also interested in investigating their mid- and far - infrared emission properties , and in particular to see if a relationship exists between the infrared luminosity of the qso and morphology of the host .",
    "interest in the infrared properties of qsos has been fueled by suggestions of an evolutionary connection between qsos and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , where both types of objects represent different phases in the end stage of the merger of two relatively equal mass gas - rich spirals ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "key to such a connection has been the suggestion that those qsos with the strongest mid / far-infrared excess \" emission seem to have  disturbed \" hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whose properties are somewhat similar to the hosts of  warm \" ulirgs . for the qsos ,  infrared - excess \"",
    "has been defined using the mean radio - to - xray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of qsos @xcite .",

    "in addition to the well - known  blue bump \" ( bb ) of optical / uv emission at wavelengths @xmath107@xmath39 m , thought to be associated with thermal emission from an accretion disk , there also exists an  infrared / submillimeter bump \" at wavelengths @xmath108@xmath39 m , which is interpreted as being primarily due to dust re - radiation of emission from either the accretion disk or from embedded circumnuclear star formation .",
    "the  infrared excess \" is then defined to be the ratio of luminosities in the two  bumps \" , @xmath15 .",
    "the recent availability of reprocessed iso observations of qsos @xcite , plus the release of the _ iras _ faint source catalog @xcite , have now made it possible to more accurately estimate the strength as well as the color temperature of the `` infrared / submillimeter bump '' for the bqs qsos .",
    "in particular , we have been able for the first time to compile fluxes in four wavebands ( 12@xmath39 m , 25@xmath39 m , 60@xmath39 m and 100@xmath39 m ) for the majority ( 18/32 ) of our bqs sources , and in 2 - 3 of these wavebands for an additional 10 sources .",

    "only one source has just upper limits in all four wavebands .",
    "these measurements are listed here in table [ tab : rad_prop ] where they have been used to compute an infrared luminosity , @xmath109 m , and the luminosity ratio , @xmath110 , for each source following the definitions and prescriptions found in table 1 of @xcite .    using the data in table [ tab : rad_prop ] , we compare the infrared / optical ratio , @xmath111 , of the qso hosts versus host type in fig .",

    "the previously observed correlation between non - disturbed hosts and e host type then implies ( as shown in table [ tab : hostclassstat ] ) that the median @xmath111 ratio for  disturbed \" and  strongly disturbed \" hosts is also approximately twice the median ratio for  non - disturbed \" hosts .",
    "a strong correlation between ir luminosity and host morphology had previously been suggested by @xcite , although a close comparison between his ",
    "quiet / disturbed \" classification and the images presented here shows that the images he used lacked the angular resolution and/or depth to reliably classify the host galaxies : for example , pg1411 + 442 and pg1700 + 518 , two of the most disturbed objects in our sample , were classified as `` quiet '' , while pg0923 + 201 and pg0844 + 349 were classified as disturbed .",
    "another method of characterizing the mid / far - infrared emission of qsos has been to use the mid / far - infrared color temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the color - color plot shown in fig .",

    "our results suggest that the percentage of disturbed hosts is significant ( 15 - 30% ) across the range of observed host luminosities ( @xmath128 ) , even though the main host type clearly changes from hosts with prominent disks to hosts which appear to be luminous ellipticals .",
    "whether disturbed hosts represent a particular phase is the lifetime of virtually all qsos or whether they represent an inherently separate class of qsos is somewhat unclear .",
    "the answer to this question depends on the answers to two subsidiary questions : ( 1 ) what is the time scale for qso activity relative to that for the persistence of recognizable signs of disturbance due to a strong interaction or merger ? and ( 2 ) what is the true space density of qsos with bolometric luminosities above some specific value and the fraction of these that show some level of disturbance indicating a recent merger ?",
    "our study has some bearing on this second question .",
    "however , it now seems likely that uv - selected optical qso samples , such as the one studied here , may represent considerably less than half of the total qso population at a comparable bolometric luminosity .",
    "in addition , recent work by @xcite comparing qsos found in the sloan digital sky survey with the pg sample shows that the pg sample is seriously incomplete even in terms of its own specified selection criteria .",
    "this incompleteness suggests two imperatives for future work .",
    "first , it seems essential to develop a sample that is substantially complete to a specific bolometric qso luminosity over some large volume .",
    "this effort will necessarily require complementary techniques covering wavelength regimes at least from x - rays to the far ir .",
    "second , it will be necessary to carry out imaging studies similar to those we have done for the pgbqs on representative subsamples of qsos identified by these other techniques , for it is quite likely that , for example , the fraction showing signs of mergers may vary for samples selected by different criteria . a recent step in this direction",
    "has been taken by @xcite for qsos with @xmath129 found in the 2mass survey , for which they find an extraordinarily high fraction ( @xmath17% ) show disturbances indicating tidal interactions .",
    "we thank the referee for a careful reading of the paper and useful comments to help improve both its content and its presentation .",
    "we also thank gabriela canalizo for a helpful conversation .",
