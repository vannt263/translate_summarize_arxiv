    "merging binary neutron stars ( bnss ) and neutron star  black hole ( ns - bh ) systems represent the leading scenarios to explain the phenomenology of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ; e.g. , @xcite ) and are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) for the detection with interferometric detectors such as advanced ligo and virgo @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that within @xmath3 after the merger , a bh - torus system forms that can power a transient relativistic jet through accretion and thus produce the sgrb emission lasting @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations by the _ swift _ satellite @xcite have revealed long - lasting , `` plateau - shaped '' x - ray afterglows in the vast majority of observed sgrb events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these afterglows indicate ongoing energy injection by a central engine on timescales up to @xmath5 , which is commonly interpreted as magnetic spin - down radiation from an ( in)definitely stable ns formed in a bns merger ( referred to as the `` magnetar model '' ; @xcite ) .    while recent observations of high - mass neutron stars @xcite indicate a rather stiff equation of state and make the formation of a long - lived or even stable ns a likely possibility in the majority of bns merger events , the existence of long - lasting , sustained x - ray afterglows challenge , in particular , the ns - bh progenitor scenario , as a ns can not be formed in this case .",
    "more severe , however , is the following apparent dichotomy . on the one hand ,",
    "a bh - torus system with accretion timescales of less than one second can not sustain continuous energy emission on timescales @xmath6 . on the other hand , while the magnetar model can explain the long - lasting x - ray afterglows , it can not readily explain how the prompt sgrb should be generated . despite attempts to explain",
    "the prompt emission in a way that is similar to long gamma - ray bursts @xcite , numerical simulations of bns mergers have not found indications for the formation of a jet when a remnant ns is formed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here we propose a new scenario that can solve this dichotomy .",
    "this scenario assumes a bns merger that produces a long - lived ns , which emits spin - down radiation and eventually collapses to a bh - torus system .",
    "while the relativistic jet produced by the bh - torus system can easily drill through , the spin - down emission is trapped in a photon - pair plasma nebula and an outer shell of matter ejected shortly after the ns is formed .",
    "the resulting delay can effectively reverse the observation times of the two signals and can explain why the x - ray emission powered by the ns spin - down is ( in part ) observed after the prompt sgrb emission .",
    "the idea that a delayed afterglow emission could solve the problem has also been proposed in a parallel work by @xcite , although with a different phenomenology . in this letter",
    ", we focus on showing that the time delay between the prompt sgrb and the long - lasting x - ray signal can be large enough to explain the observed x - ray afterglow durations .",
    "this represents a fundamental validation ( not considered by @xcite ) and a necessary condition to make the scenario worth considering .",
    "the merger of two nss forms a differentially rotating object .",
    "the time - reversal scenario proposed here requires that the merger remnant is a supramassive ns , i.e. , a ns with mass above the maximum mass for nonrotating configurations @xmath7 , but below the maximum mass for uniformly rotating configurations @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xcite , if it migrates below this limit by substantial mass loss before differential rotation is removed . ] .",
    "this implies that the ns does not require differential rotation to support it against gravitational collapse , and the latter is prevented by uniform rotation as long as the spin rate is high enough ; therefore , the time of collapse to a bh is typically of the order of the spin - down timescale . given that the mass distribution of bnss peaks around @xmath10 @xcite and that recent observations find ns masses as large as @xmath11 @xcite , supramassive ns merger remnants are a very likely possibility .",
    "in addition to mass ejection associated with the merger process , the newly born ns can launch baryon - loaded winds ( see figure  [ fig : phenomenology ] , ( i ) ) , either produced by large magnetic pressure gradients at the stellar surface due to magnetic field amplification in the differentially rotating stellar interior @xcite , or induced by neutrino emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both mechanisms can typically produce mass - loss rates of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "while baryon pollution resulting from dynamical merger ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) is mostly restricted to the orbital plane , the magnetically and neutrino - induced winds are highly isotropic , with bulk speeds @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "magnetically induced winds are associated with differential rotation , which can only last for at most @xmath14 , assuming typical initial magnetic field strengths @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that during this timescale the initial magnetic fields can be amplified by orders of magnitude . for neutrino - induced winds ,",
    "the typical cooling timescales are @xmath16 @xcite ; therefore , they can also last no longer than @xmath17 .    at @xmath18 ,",
    "the merger remnant has settled down to a uniformly rotating , strongly magnetized ns and further mass ejection is suppressed . as the baryon density in the surrounding of the ns drops , the ns starts to emit electromagnetic ( em ) spin - down radiation at the expense of rotational energy , with luminosity @xmath19 , where @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the surface magnetic field strength and initial spin period at @xmath18 , respectively , @xmath23 is the ns radius , and @xmath24 is the spin - down timescale .",
    "the spin - down emission inflates a photon - pair plasma nebula ( henceforth  nebula \" ; @xcite ) behind the expanding ejecta ( see figure  [ fig : phenomenology ] , ( ii ) ) . the high photon pressure associated with this photon - pair plasma drives a strong shock through the ejecta , which sweeps up the material into a thin shell while rapidly propagating toward the outer ejecta radius . at shock breakout ,",
    "a transient signal observed as an early precursor to the sgrb @xcite could be produced .",
    "nebula energy is deposited in the optically thick ejecta and converted into thermal and kinetic energy , causing a rapid acceleration of the ejecta to relativistic speeds @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the injection of spin - down energy into the nebula ceases at @xmath26 , when rotation can no longer prevent the ns from collapsing to a bh . within millisecond timescales , a bh - torus system forms and",
    "generates the necessary conditions to launch a relativistic jet of duration @xmath27 , which corresponds to the typical accretion time of the torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this jet drills through the ejecta shell and eventually breaks out , producing the prompt sgrb emission ( see figure  [ fig : phenomenology ] , ( iii ) ) .",
    "as the nebula and the ejecta shell are optically thick for the times of interest , the spin - down energy radiated away by the ns up to @xmath28 emerges from the outer radius of the ejecta shell with a substantial delay , producing the observed long - lasting x - ray afterglow radiation . compared to this delay , the timescale for the jet to drill through the ejecta and to break out is orders of magnitudes smaller ( see section  [ sec : timing_argument ] ) .",
    "hence , the spin - down emission , although produced before the jet is formed , can be observed for a long time after the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "an important point to stress is that in the time - reversal scenario the observed x - ray afterglow durations correspond to such a delay and not to the spin - down timescale of the ns .",
    "the crucial validation to assess whether the time - reversal scenario outlined above can be compatible with the combined observations of sgrb prompt emission and long - lasting x - ray afterglows comes from the analysis of the photon diffusion timescales associated with the nebula and the ejecta .",
    "the scenario can not hold unless the delay of the signal produced by the ns spin - down just before the collapse can account for the observed duration of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "the argument proceeds as follows . from observations ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "we can assume that the ns exists for a time @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we typically have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the time needed by the shock to propagate outward through the ejecta . consequently , at @xmath28 the ejecta has already been compressed into a thin shell of thickness @xmath32 , which moves outward at relativistic speeds .    most of the emission from the ns can not reach the outer radius @xmath33 of the ejecta shell later than @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total time of photon diffusion across the nebula and the ejecta shell . at @xmath36 , any photon that was present in the system at @xmath28",
    "has had enough time to escape ; therefore , the emission is suppressed for @xmath37 . the corresponding delay with respect to the light travel time",
    "is given by @xmath38 .",
    "the emission from the jet is also delayed due to the time to launch the jet after the collapse ( @xmath39 ) and the fact that the jet has to propagate outward through the nebula and the ejecta shell with an effective speed smaller than @xmath40 . while the propagation speed through the baryon - poor nebula is very close to @xmath40 , the drill time through the ejecta shell dominates the total delay @xmath41 .    assuming a non - relativistic jet head speed , the drill time across the ejecta can be estimated by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the density of the ejecta shell , @xmath44 the jet opening angle , and @xmath45 the jet luminosity . for typical parameter values",
    ", however , equation   yields a drill time smaller than the corresponding light travel time , which indicates that the jet head speed has to be relativistic .",
    "this is mainly due to the very low densities at @xmath46 ( see section  [ sec : difftimescales ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath41 is negligible with respect to the other timescales of interest .    in conclusion , a necessary condition to explain a certain duration of the x - ray afterglow , @xmath47 , is given by @xmath48",
    "we compute the diffusion timescales and , hence , @xmath49 in terms of the following parameters : the timescale for removal of differential rotation @xmath50 , the mass ejection rate @xmath51 ( as long as differential rotation is sustained , i.e. , for @xmath52 ) , the magnetic field strength at the pole , @xmath21 , and the initial rotation period @xmath53 of the ns once it has settled down to uniform rotation .",
    "moreover , we need to specify the time @xmath54 at which the shock reaches the outer ejecta radius @xmath33 , the expansion speed of the ejecta before and after @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , the pair yield in the nebula , @xmath57 , and the ejecta opacity @xmath58 . for the last two parameters , we assume canonical values @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .    at @xmath61 ,",
    "the ns is still surrounded by a baryon - loaded and nearly isotropic wind that extends up to @xmath62 and has an average density of @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "once differential rotation is removed , mass ejection is suppressed and spin - down emission drives a strong shock through the ejecta that rapidly ( @xmath64 ) sweeps up the ejecta mass ( @xmath65 ) into a thin shell of shocked fluid with thickness @xmath32 . from the rankine - hugoniot conditions for a strong shock and assuming an ideal fluid equation of state for the ejecta with @xmath66 , shock compression produces a jump in density of a factor of 7 , i.e. , at @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "this allows us to compute the corresponding shell thickness @xmath70 , which we assume to be constant for @xmath71 .",
    "after @xmath54 , the ejecta shell is rapidly accelerated to its asymptotic speed @xmath56 .",
    "the density of the shell for @xmath72 is thus given by @xmath73 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    if the ejecta shell at time @xmath74 was at rest , the associated `` static '' photon diffusion timescale would be @xmath75 where we have added the light travel time to account for a possible transition to the optically thin regime .",
    "similarly , if the nebula was not expanding , the associated diffusion timescale resulting from the electron ",
    "positron pairs would be given by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the thomson cross section , @xmath78 the electron mass , @xmath79 the spin down luminosity , and @xmath80 the radius of the nebula . note that for @xmath81 , both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are monotonically decreasing functions of time .",
    "the actual photon diffusion timescales differ from equations   and , as the properties of the system ( e.g. , @xmath33 and @xmath43 ) can significantly change while a photon is propagating outward .",
    "nevertheless , equations   and can be employed to derive lower and upper bounds . for a photon emitted by the ns just before @xmath28",
    ", an upper bound on the total diffusion time through the nebula and the ejecta is given by the sum of the two static diffusion times at @xmath28 ( thanks to the monotonicity property mentioned above ) : @xmath84 .",
    "hence , @xmath85 a lower bound on @xmath49 can be placed by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 . as a conservative estimate of @xmath49 to be used in checking the validity of equation",
    ", we henceforth use the lower limit given by equation  .    , for @xmath89 g ( from top to bottom ) and",
    "@xmath90ms ( dotted , solid , dash - dotted ) , assuming @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 . shown",
    "are only cases in which the ejecta shell is still optically thick.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figures [ fig : delay_tdr ] and [ fig : delay_vej ] summarize results for @xmath49 over the entire parameter space .",
    "reliable estimates can only be provided as long as the ejecta shell is still optically thick at @xmath87 and thus confines the nebula .",
    "figure [ fig : delay_tdr ] shows @xmath49 for a range of @xmath50 , @xmath95 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the optical depths decrease for decreasing values of @xmath95 and increasing values of @xmath53 , as the spin - down timescale and thus @xmath28 increase ( see equation  ) .",
    "in particular , the ejecta has more time to expand and thus becomes optically thinner .",
    "the results are not shown for the cases in which the ejecta shell is optically thin .",
    "as long as the ejecta are optically thick , @xmath49 is insensitive to the value of @xmath50 in the range @xmath96 . we have further verified that the same holds for expected mass - loss rates @xmath97 , shock propagation times @xmath98 , and initial wind speeds @xmath99",
    "this is because the diffusion time of the nebula is much larger than the diffusion time of the ejecta shell for the times of interest .",
    "hence , @xmath49 is largely insensitive to the properties of the shell .",
    "figure [ fig : delay_vej ] reports results on @xmath49 as a function of the two most influential parameters of our model , the magnetic field strength of the ns , @xmath95 , and the asymptotic ejecta shell velocity @xmath56 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the ejecta shell is still optically thick at @xmath87 for @xmath101 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the dotted curves indicate that for @xmath102 and low magnetic field strengths the ejecta matter can become optically thin .",
    "figure [ fig : delay_vej ] also shows that the results only become sensitive to @xmath56 for highly relativistic speeds .    , for @xmath89 g ( from top to bottom ) and @xmath94 ( solid ) , @xmath103 ( dotted ) , assuming @xmath91 , @xmath104 , @xmath93 , @xmath105 .",
    "shown are only cases in which the ejecta shell is still optically thick.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    from our estimates we conclude that in the parameter ranges @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath99 , the delay times @xmath49 are larger than @xmath110 and larger than @xmath111 for @xmath112 . therefore , according to our criterion given in equation  , the observed durations of x - ray afterglows of @xmath113 ( e.g. , @xcite ) are compatible with the proposed time - reversal scenario .",
    "in our scenario , the long - lasting ( @xmath0 ) x - ray afterglow emission accompanying a large fraction of sgrbs is produced by a long - lived supramassive ns , which eventually collapses to a bh on the spin - down timescale and thus generates the necessary conditions for a relativistic jet to be launched . while the jet can easily drill through the surrounding photon - pair plasma and baryon - loaded ejecta , spin - down radiation emitted by the ns before the collapse diffuses outward on a much longer timescale , accumulating a significant delay before finally escaping .",
    "this delay explains how the x - ray emission powered by spin - down radiation before the collapse is observed in part before and in part after the prompt emission .",
    "the optically thick nebula and ejecta are therefore responsible for a `` time reversal '' of the observed signals .    in our simple analysis ,",
    "we have focused on the estimation of the maximum delay that can affect the spin - down radiation , depending on the most relevant properties of the system . if this delay is shorter than the duration of an observed x - ray afterglow , the latter can not be explained within the time - reversal scenario .",
    "therefore , this test is crucial to make the scenario worth considering .    by exploring a wide range of physical parameters",
    ", we find that in most cases , afterglow durations of up to @xmath114 are compatible with the estimated delays .",
    "moreover , we find that the maximum delay is always determined by the high optical depth of the nebula , which dominates over the optical depth of the ejecta .    one important consequence of this new scenario is that for all sgrb events accompanied by a long - lasting x - ray afterglow , the progenitor would be necessarily a bns and not a bh - ns binary .",
    "furthermore , the peak amplitude of gw emission associated with the time of the merger would reach the observer long before the em prompt sgrb signal .",
    "the two signals would be separated by the lifetime of the supramassive ns , which can easily exceed @xmath115 , with profound consequences for coincident gw and em observations .",
    "this separation would provide an accurate measurement of the ns lifetime ( to better than 1% ) .",
    "a supporting piece of evidence for our scenario comes from the observation of steep decay phases in some of the x - ray afterglow light curves , which are interpreted as a collapse to a bh ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these features are in favor of the long - lived supramassive ns assumed here . a strong indication for the time - reversal scenario would come from the observation of x - ray `` afterglow '' emission prior to the sgrb itself , i.e. , of a plateau - like x - ray light curve with the prompt emission in between",
    ". this would be indicative of a change in arrival times with respect to the emission times of the two signals .",
    "moreover , the observation of  orphan \" sgrb - like events , with a plateau - like x - ray emission , but missing prompt emission , can confirm the isotropy of the afterglow radiation we expect . in this case , the collimated prompt emission would be beamed away from us .",
    "a potential difficulty is posed by the observation of several sgrb events in which the x - ray afterglow light curve shows a late - time decay compatible with @xmath116 .",
    "this is the behavior expected for spin - down radiation at @xmath81 ( see above equation  ( [ eq : sd ] ) ) . in our scenario , we need to explain how this particular decay is not altered by the optically thick environment surrounding the ns .",
    "we find that for the cases considered here , the delay due to the diffusion time of photons through the ejecta shell at times @xmath117 is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the spin - down timescale and , thus , such diffusion should have no effect on the time behavior of the signal luminosity .",
    "the diffusion timescale associated with the nebula , however , is not smaller than the spin - down timescale and whether the trapped radiation would still emerge with the same time dependence as the spin - down injection luminosity remains in doubt ."
