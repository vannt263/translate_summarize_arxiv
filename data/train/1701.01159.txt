    "the importance of magnetic fields to the process of accretion is now widely accepted .",
    "magnetic fields are paramount to the operation of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which drives turbulence within differentially rotating discs .",
    "this turbulence acts as an effective viscosity , transporting angular momentum and dissipating energy to facilitate accretion onto the central object .",
    "magnetic fields also likely play a critical role in powering the narrow , fast jets of outflowing gas often associated with discs @xcite .",
    "these fields may also launch wider , slower winds @xcite , observed in multiple black hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields may also play a more subtle role in helping stabilize accretion discs .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xcite ( also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) argued that strong magnetic fields can stabilize thin discs against both thermal and viscous instabilities .",
    "there are now numerical results to back up that claim @xcite .",
    "this is potentially very important as it may help explain why accretion discs in x - ray binaries generally show far less variability at high luminosities than would be expected if these instabilities were at play .",
    "so far , models that advocate for strong magnetic fields in accretion discs have failed to demonstrate conclusively how those fields get there in the first place and whether or not they can remain strong .",
    "for instance , discs threaded with a net vertical magnetic flux have been shown in shearing box numerical simulations to achieve high magnetization ( @xmath2 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . however , it is not clear in all cases that an adequate supply of such flux exists @xcite .",
    "another suggested avenue for achieving high magnetization is through a thermal runaway @xcite .",
    "rapid cooling of an initially hot , thick , weakly magnetized disc can increase the magnetic flux by trapping magnetic field within the collapsing disc . yet , even if such a thermal runaway were to occur , it would likely only produce a transient high - magnetization phase , unless there is a mechanism that would allow the disc to persist in such a state .    a third possibility was suggested by @xcite , who proposed a dynamo process mediated by the parker instability , in which buoyantly rising azimuthal field is replenished by the stretching of radial field created as gas particles slide down inclined field lines .",
    "this dynamo was predicted to maintain high disc magnetizations ( @xmath3 ) , and the authors found support for this claim through shearing box simulations .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , those simulations used periodic boundary conditions on the top and bottom of the box , thereby preventing magnetic field from escaping .",
    "shearing box simulations with more realistic `` open '' vertical boundary conditions , on the other hand , found only weak magnetizations ( @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bringing the parker - driven dynamo into question .    in this work",
    ", we report on simulations that are specifically designed to test the question of whether discs are able to remain strongly magnetized , assuming they are able to somehow achieve this state .",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , we focus on the case of initially purely toroidal field configurations .",
    "however , unlike those works , we perform _ global _ simulations . three important advantages of global simulations are : 1 ) there are no concerns about about boundary issues since the domain is larger than the entire disc ; 2 ) any global instabilities or correlations with length scales larger than a typical shearing box will be captured ; and 3 ) global simulations naturally include the curvature terms neglected in shearing boxes .",
    "of course , two significant disadvantage of global simulations are : 1 ) the computational cost of achieving adequate resolution ; and 2 ) the limited duration allowed when the simulation is initiated from a finite equilibrium distribution , as in our study . for example , by the time we stop our strongly magnetized simulation , the disc has lost over 80% of its initial mass into the black hole . nevertheless , we are able to clearly demonstrate that the magnetization of such discs becomes weak on the timescale of a few tens of orbits .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe our numerical set up .",
    "then , in section [ s.results ] we present our results . in section [ s.discuss ] , we end with some concluding thoughts . throughout most of the text ,",
    "we use units where @xmath5 , so physical lengths and times are recovered by multiplying by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we consider two cases of magnetized tori , both initialized with purely toroidal magnetic fields following the procedure described in @xcite .",

    "the dimensionless black hole spin is @xmath13 .",
    "the mass of the black hole is left unspecified , as it simply sets a scale for the problem .",
    "the solutions presented in @xcite all assumed a constant specific angular momentum ; more general solutions with power - law angular velocities were demonstrated in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we only consider constant specific angular momentum cases with @xmath14 .",
    "while it is conceivable that one might be able to construct an initial angular momentum distribution that would alter our conclusions , we suspect that this would only be true for very unusual distributions .",

    "case a comes directly from @xcite and was also studied in @xcite ; its initial configuration is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : fluxes ] , we compare the magnetic flux at the horizon , i.e. @xmath60 with the mass flux , @xmath61 ( calculated by replacing @xmath62 in equation ( [ eq : mag_flux ] ) with @xmath63 ) .",
    "we also show the total integrated magnetic energy @xmath64 and mass , @xmath8 ( calculated by replacing @xmath65 in equation ( [ eq : total_mag ] ) with @xmath66 ) , on the grid as a function of time .",
    "we find that the flux of magnetic field into the black hole is insignificant when compared to the total drop in magnetic energy on the grid .",
    "this is unlike the mass , where the flux at the event horizon nicely matches the drop in total mass , as it should .",
    "( magnetic energy losses through the outer radial boundary are negligible in both cases . ) therefore , the significant drop in magnetic energy must have another cause .",
    "reconnection is another possibility to consider . in many mri turbulent disc simulations ,",
    "magnetic energy is converted to gas internal energy ( heat ) through reconnection at the grid scale .",
    "however , given that our global field topology is purely azimuthal ( and in a uniform direction ) and reconnection within the computational domain can not change this topology , it is not possible to lower the overall magnetic energy in this way .",
    "reconnection can , and certainly does , take place during the mri - driven turbulence phase , but it can not , by itself , be responsible for the reduction of total magnetic energy that we see in case a.    it seems , in the end , that most of the drop in magnetic energy in figure [ fig : fluxes ] is owing to work being done by the magnetic field on the gas .",
    "whereas in weakly magnetized discs the mri dynamo often increases the total magnetic energy ( see case aw in the lower left panel of figure [ fig : fluxes ] ) , in the strongly magnetized case , it seems the mri facilitates a redistribution of the gas and magnetic field , such that the magnetization drops and the disc becomes weakly magnetized in its interior . as a result of this redistribution , the magnetic field that initially occupied the inner disc region is dispersed over a much larger volume by the end of the simulation .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmag_rho ] , where much of the field is found outside the disc , especially in the funnel region .",
    "this spreading of the field over a larger volume necessarily results in a drop in magnetic pressure within the disc .    , with contours of gas density , @xmath18 , for the strongly magnetized case ( a ) .",
    "the contours are spaced logarithmically over 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "data are time averaged over the final orbital period , @xmath67 , of the simulation . ]",
    "additional insight can be gained by looking again at fig .",
    "[ fig : butterfly ] . as before ,",
    "we see considerable variability in the strength of @xmath44 for case a ( bottom panel ) , but no well - organized cycle .",
    "furthermore , in this case , the field fails to return to anything close to its initial value .",
    "instead , the mean field strength is reduced by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that , similar to net poloidal flux in shearing box simulations , strong toroidal fields in global simulations can interfere with the mri dynamo .",
    "there is also no evidence for a parker - driven dynamo .",
    "one final note of interest regarding the strongly magnetized torus case is that , for the brief period that the magnetization , @xmath68 , is high , the dimensionless stress , @xmath69 , is also high ( compare figs . [",
    "fig : pmagpgas ] and [ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that discs threaded with a net vertical flux exhibit systematically higher values of @xmath70 as the flux increases , but this is the first evidence that we are aware of a similar dependence of @xmath69 on the strength of the toroidal field . for our finite size torus , where the disc never reaches a true steady state , this makes a noticeable difference in how quickly material accretes onto the black hole ( figure [ fig : fluxes ] right panels ) .",
    "however , this appears to be a transient effect in our case .",
    "if we had run a longer simulation by either starting with a larger torus or one located further from the black hole , then we anticipate that the value for @xmath69 would have steadily declined , as did the magnetization , to a value comparable to our weak magnetization case .",
    "in this work , we studied the evolution of magnetic fields in initially strongly magnetized ( toroidal field ) global simulations , similar in nature to shearing box simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we started with magnetic fields of differing strengths [ @xmath71 or 10 ] and let the simulations run for many orbital periods . in both cases , we found that the disc ultimately reached weakly magnetized configurations ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this same limit has been reached in all weak initial field configurations of which we are aware ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and also for the strong , toroidal fields considered in @xcite .",
    "only when large scale ( i.e. non - local ) fields are present , as in the case of a net poloidal flux @xcite or strong radial component @xcite , are strong magnetizations sustained within the disc .    in our initially high ( toroidal ) magnetization case , we find that the magnetization drops mostly because of a redistribution of the gas and magnetic fields .",
    "the strong magnetic fields do work against the gas , pushing their way into the funnel region and out to large radii .",
    "this happens over a few tens of orbital periods , and the azimuthal field in the disc is never fully replenished .",
    "thus , this simulation shows no evidence of the parker - driven dynamo predicted by @xcite .",
    "our work confirms the shearing box results of @xcite that discs with predominantly toroidal magnetic fields can not remain strongly magnetized ( @xmath73 ) , at least not within 1 - 2 scale heights of the disc midplane . in other words",
    ", strong toroidal magnetic fields are not locally self - sustaining within the body of the disc .",
    "if strongly magnetized discs are then required to explain the apparent stability of many accreting black hole x - ray binaries at high luminosities , then the discs must be threaded by some other dominant field component , either radial or vertical .",
    "additionally , the thermal collapse scenario for creating strongly magnetized discs , even if it is possible , must lead to only a temporary increase in magnetization , lasting only a few tens of orbits .",
