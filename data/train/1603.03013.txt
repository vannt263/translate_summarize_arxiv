    "noise plays an essential role in many physical , biological and even social systems . therefore , for the understanding of those systems it is important to characterize the noise and explain its origin .",
    "one of the characteristics used for description of the noise is the power spectral density ( psd ) . in may cases",
    "the noise can be modeled as a white noise which has a frequency - independent psd . however , there are various physical systems where the noise has significant dependence on frequency .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the psd is referred to as a `` color '' of the noise .",
    "pink noise or @xmath0 noise is a random process described by the psd @xmath2 inversely proportional to the frequency , that is @xmath3 with @xmath4 close to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath0 noise has been observed first as an excess low - frequency noise in vacuum tubes @xcite .",
    "later such noise has been found in condensed matter @xcite and other systems @xcite .",
    "origin and the general nature of @xmath0 noise is up to now the subject of discussions and investigations , for review see @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed to explain the origin of @xmath0 noise ; for a short overview of the models see introduction of @xcite . in many condensed matter systems",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum is considered as a superposition lorentzians with a wide range distribution of relaxation times @xcite . in this",
    "approach @xmath6 noise with the desirable slope @xmath4 requires a certain distribution of parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that only several well separated decay rates are sufficient to yield an approximately @xmath0 power spectrum @xcite .",
    "self - organized criticality ( soc ) provides models of @xmath0 noise relevant for understanding of driven non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of soc not necessarily yields @xmath0 fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 noise in the fluctuations of a mass was first seen in a sandpile model with threshold dissipation proposed in @xcite and was analytically obtained in a one - dimensional directed model of sandpiles @xcite . yet another model of @xmath0 noise represents the signals as sequences of the renewal pulses or events with the power - law distribution of the inter - event time @xcite .",
    "recently , thermal finite - size fluctuations as mechanism for @xmath0 noise has been proposed @xcite .    in some systems the @xmath0 fluctuations are non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "power - law distribution of signal intensity as well as power - law behavior of the psd in a wide range of frequencies can be obtained using point processes where the time between the adjacent pulses experience relatively slow the brownian - like motion @xcite .",
    "starting from this point process model nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) generating @xmath6 noise have been derived in @xcite .",
    "such nonlinear sdes have been applied to describe signals in socio - economical systems @xcite and as a model of neuronal firing @xcite",
    ".    however , in most cases @xmath0 noise is a gaussian process @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath6 psd , proposed in @xcite , is the necessity of power - law steady - state probability density function ( pdf ) of the signal .",
    "it is impossible to obtain gaussian pdf together with @xmath0 spectrum from such nonlinear sdes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to remedy this drawback of nonlinear sdes as source of @xmath0 noise by considering not only one sde , but a system of two coupled sdes . in the system of coupled sdes",
    "we interpret the first equation as giving the signal , whereas the second equation represents a fluctuating rate of change .",
    "we demonstrate that the proposed coupled stochastic differential equations allows us to obtain @xmath0 spectrum in a wide range of frequencies together with almost arbitrary steady - state pdf of the signal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we obtain a system of coupled sdes generating signals with @xmath6 psd by considering the scaling properties of the equations .",
    "numerical methods of solution of such equations are discussed in .",
    "sdes obtained in do not have the most general form that is allowed by scaling properties required to get @xmath6 spectrum . for completeness , in we consider a more general , but more complicated form of equations",
    ". summarizes our findings .",
    "in this section we obtain a pair of coupled nonlinear sdes by considering the scaling properties required to get @xmath6 psd .",
    "the method we use is similar to that in @xcite , however now we consider two stochastic variables and two equations .",
    "we assume that the first equation describes the fluctuations of the signal , with the fluctuating rate of change described by the second equation .",
    "we can obtain a pair of coupled nonlinear sdes generating signals exhibiting @xmath0 noise by using the following considerations .",
    "the wiener - khintchine theorem @xmath7 relates the psd @xmath2 to the autocorrelation function @xmath8 . if the psd has a power - law behavior @xmath9 in a wide range of frequencies @xmath10 , then , when the influence of the limiting frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 is neglected , the psd has a scaling property @xmath13 for the frequencies in this range . in this paper",
    "we will consider signals with psd having @xmath6 behavior only in some wide intermediate region of frequencies @xmath10 . to avoid the divergence of the total power occuring for pure @xmath0 behavior at arbitrarily small frequencies we assume that the psd is bounded for small frequencies @xmath14 outside of this region .",
    "compatibility with experimental data can be ensured by choosing sufficiently small limiting frequency @xmath11 .    from the wiener - khintchine theorem and equation",
    "it follows that the autocorrelation function has the scaling property @xmath15 in the time range @xmath16 . assuming that we have two stochastic variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the signal represented by the stochastic variable @xmath17 , the autocorrelation function can be written as @xcite @xmath19^{2}\\,.\\label{eq : autocorr}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the steady - state pdf and @xmath21 is the transition probability ( the conditional probability that at time @xmath22 the stochastic variables have values @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the condition that at time @xmath25 they had had the values @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the transition probability can be obtained from the solution of the fokker - planck equation with the initial condition @xmath26 . the last term in equation ,",
    "being a constant , does not influence the psd at frequencies @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we will neglect this term from now on .",
    "one of the ways to obtain the required scaling property is for the steady - state pdf to be a power - law function of the stochastic variable @xmath18 , @xmath28 and for the transition probability to have the scaling property @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the scaling exponent and @xmath31 is the power - law exponent of the steady - state pdf of the stochastic variable @xmath18 .",
    "means that the change of the magnitude of the stochastic variable @xmath32 is equivalent to the change of time scale @xmath33 . using equations  and performing a change of variables we get @xmath34 therefore , the autocorrelation function has the required scaling property with @xmath4 given by @xmath35 we see that we obtain the pure @xmath0 noise when @xmath36 .    in order to avoid the divergence of the steady - state pdf , the diffusion of stochastic variable @xmath18 should be restricted at least from the side of small values . in general , equation can hold only in some region @xmath37 . when the diffusion of stochastic variable @xmath18 is restricted , equation also can not be exact .",
    "however , if the influence of the limiting values @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be neglected for the time @xmath22 in some region @xmath40 , we can expect for the scaling to be approximately valid in this time region .    to get",
    "the required scaling of the transition probability , only powers of the stochastic variable @xmath18 should enter into the pair of sdes .",
    "assuming that the coefficient in the noise term of the first equation is proportional to @xmath41 , we will consider the following coupled it sdes @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are standard wiener processes .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 in equation gives the intensity of the noise and the coefficient @xmath46 needs to be determined .",
    "one can see that equations and indeed lead to the scaling of transition probability .",
    "changing the variable @xmath18 in , to the scaled variable @xmath47 or introducing the scaled time @xmath48 and using the property of the wiener process @xmath49 we get the same resulting equations .",
    "therefore , the change of the scale of the variable @xmath18 and change of time scale are equivalent , as in equation , and the scaling exponent @xmath30 is equal to @xmath50    to ensure steady - state pdf and for determination the unknown coefficient @xmath46 in equation we write the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the system of sdes and @xcite @xmath51 the steady - state pdf @xmath20 is the solution of the equation @xmath52 can be written in terms of the components of the probability current @xmath53 as @xmath54 inserting equation into and we get @xmath55\\ , , \\label{eq : sx-1}\\\\ j_{y}(x , y ) = y^{2\\eta+1-\\lambda}p(x)\\left[u(x)-\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\eta+1 -\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right)\\right]\\ , .",

    "thus the function @xmath57 in should be a solution of the differential equation @xmath58 this equation means that the steady - state pdf of the stochastic variable @xmath17 is determined only by the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the sde  .",
    "further , assuming that the @xmath18-component of the probability current @xmath61 should vanish at the boundaries that are not parallel to @xmath18 axis , we get that the expression in the square brackets in equation should be zero for different values of @xmath17 .",

    "it follows that the power - law exponent in the psd of the signal generated by sdes , is related to the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath31 as @xmath65    to get a stationary process and avoid the divergence of steady - state pdf , equation should be considered together with boundaries restricting the diffusion of stochastic variable @xmath18 or be modified .",
    "the simplest choice restricting the range of diffusion of the stochastic variable @xmath18 is the reflective boundaries at @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "another possibility is the modification of equation to get rapidly decreasing steady - state pdf when the stochastic variable @xmath18 acquires values outside of the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "for example , the steady - state pdf @xmath69 with @xmath70 has a power - law dependence on @xmath18 when @xmath71 and exponential cut - offs when @xmath18 is outside of the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "this exponentially restricted steady - state pdf is a result of the sde @xmath72 obtained from equation by introducing additional terms in the drift .",
    "the restriction of the diffusion of the stochastic variable @xmath18 to the interval @xmath37 makes the scaling only approximate . as a result , the power - law part of the psd is limited to a finite range of frequencies @xmath73 .",
    "let us estimate the limiting frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the limiting values @xmath66 and @xmath67 should also participate in the scaling and equation for the transition probability corresponding to sdes and becomes @xmath74 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 enter as parameters of the transition probability .",
    "similarly , the steady - state pdf @xmath75 has the scaling property @xmath76 inserting equations and into we get @xmath77 from this scaling of the autocorrelation function it follows that time @xmath22 should enter only in combinations with the limiting values @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we can expect that the influence of the limiting values can be neglected and the scaling be approximately valid when @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "in other words , we expect that the scaling holds when time @xmath22 is in the interval @xmath82 when @xmath83 and in the interval @xmath84 when @xmath85 . using equation the frequency range where the psd has @xmath6 behavior can be estimated as @xmath86 we see that the width of the frequency range where the psd has @xmath6 behavior grows with increase of the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath88 ( which corresponds to @xmath89 ) the width of the frequency region is zero and we do not have @xmath6 power spectral density .",
    "since analytical solution of stochastic differential equations can be obtained only in particular cases , there is a need of numerical solution . using euler - maruyama method with small time step @xmath90 for numerical solution of sdes and",
    ", we get the discretized equations @xmath91 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 are independent random variables with the standard normal distribution",
    ". however , for numerical solution of nonlinear equations the solution schemes involving a fixed time step @xmath90 can be inefficient .",
    "for example , in equations and with @xmath94 , large values of stochastic variable @xmath18 lead to large coefficients and thus require a very small time step .",
    "the numerical solution scheme can by improved by using a variable time step that becomes small only when @xmath18 becomes large .",
    "such method of solution of a single nonlinear sde has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the variable time step is equivalent to the introduction of the internal time @xmath95 that is different from the real , physical , time @xmath22 @xcite .    in order to make the solution more efficient we introduce an internal , operational , time @xmath95 by the equation @xmath96",
    "we assume that the zero of the internal time @xmath95 coincides with the zero of the physical time @xmath22 , thus the initial condition for the internal time is @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 , from equation it follows that @xmath99 is a strictly increasing function of time @xmath22 .",

    "the psd of the signal @xmath131 has power - law behavior for a wide range of frequencies with the power - law exponent @xmath184 we get @xmath0 noise when @xmath36 . assuming that the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 are sufficiently small",
    ", we can take @xmath185 in the numerical solution scheme ",
    ", leading to the discrete equations @xmath186 in particular , when @xmath36 and the signal @xmath17 has @xmath0 spectrum , equation becomes @xmath187",
    ". we can interpret equations  as follows : equations and describe a process consisting of discrete events occurring at time moments @xmath188 .",
    "the inter - event duration is random and equal to the stochastic variable @xmath189 .",
    "this inter - event duration slowly changes with time in such a way , that the duration of the next time interval is equal to the duration of the previous interval multiplied by some random factor close to @xmath5 .",
    "the signal @xmath190 changes only during the occurrence of the events at time moments @xmath188 and this change is described by equation .",
    "results in the steady - state pdf @xmath191 of the stochastic variable @xmath192 having a power - law form with the exponent @xmath193 .",
    "the pdf @xmath194 of a sequence of @xmath189 values generated according to equation differs from @xmath191 .",
    "when @xmath189 changes slowly with the index @xmath195 , the pdf @xmath194 should satisfy the equation @xmath196 , because going back from discrete equations to the continuous time one should assume that each value @xmath189 last for the duration also equal @xmath189 .",
    "consequently , the pdf @xmath194 is also a power - law with the exponent @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "thus , if @xmath31 is close to @xmath5 then @xmath199 is close to @xmath200 .",
    "there are many processes in the nature with the power - law inter - event time distribution .",
    "for example , many human - related activities show power - law decaying inter - event time distribution with exponents usually varying between @xmath5 and @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "power - law distribution of inter - event times has been observed in neuron - firing sequences @xcite and in the timings of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "in addition , power - law decaying inter - event time distribution is often accompanied by the power - law decaying autocorrelation function @xcite .",
    "let us further assume that the events are due to jumps over the potential barrier of the height @xmath201 . in many physical systems",
    "the escape rate exponentially depends on the barrier height , therefore we take @xmath202 .",
    "changing the variables in equations and we get the sdes @xmath203 similar to equations ",
    ", numerical solution scheme with the variable time step @xmath204 yields discrete equations @xmath205 from equation we see that the potential @xmath201 performs a simple random walk with a constant drift . when the potential has the value @xmath206 , the time interval that one needs to wait till the next event is @xmath207 .",
    "both signal @xmath17 and the potential @xmath201 change during the jump at time moment @xmath188 .",
    "one can also consider the case where the time interval between events is random , with the average equal to @xmath207 .",
    "we can expect that the randomness of the time interval should not change the psd of the signal @xmath131 at low frequencies .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a pair of coupled nonlinear sdes and that generate the signal @xmath131 having the power - law psd @xmath9 in arbitrarily wide range of frequencies .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 is given by equation .",
    "in contrast to a single nonlinear sde generating @xmath208 noise , the signal @xmath131 generated by the proposed pair of sdes can have almost arbitrary steady - state pdf .",
    "the steady - state pdf of the signal @xmath131 is determined only by the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the first sde .",
    "one can interpret the first equation as describing the fluctuations of the signal , with the fluctuating rate of change , described by the second equation .",
    "thus , the proposed sdes exhibit a separation between the magnitude of the fluctuations of the signal @xmath131 and the rate of fluctuations .",
    "we expect that the proposed equations will be useful for the description of @xmath0 noise in various physical and social systems .",
    "in addition , the equations can be used to numerical generation of @xmath0 noise with the desired steady - state pdf of the signal .",
