    "there are two modes in the experimentally observed magnetic excitation spectrum which have the same periodicity but are shifted with respect to each other by half a period . because of this shift the two modes provide different solutions with opposite sign of the interdimer exchange coupling @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ smfig1 ] shows the energy scans at ( 6,0,1 ) and ( 6,0,2 ) which are the dispersion minima and dispersion maxima of the intense mode along the ( 6,0,l ) direction .",
    "the scans were measured at different fixed final wave vectors of @xmath39 @xmath38 and @xmath37 @xmath38 respectively giving different energy resolutions of 0.86  mev and 2  mev , as a result the peak at ( 6,0,2 ) is wider than the peak at ( 6,0,1 ) .",
    "the solid red line gives the fit of one - triplon dispersion relation calculated to fifth order @xcite convolved by the instrumental resolution using the rescal software and corresponds to the solution with @xmath84 mev and the ratio of @xmath85 implying that the interdimer coupling is @xmath44  mev .",
    "the peaks are resolution limited with intrinsic widths of 0.01 mev while the observed asymmetric line shape of the peaks are caused by the instrumental resolution function in combination with the dispersion relation and are well reproduced by the rescal software .",
    "the instrumental resolution also affects the experimentally observed peak positions shifting the peak observed at the minimum and the maximum of the dispersion by @xmath86 0.15 mev towards the center of the band .",
    "indeed , the fifth - order one - triplon dispersion relation gives the peak positions of @xmath87  mev and @xmath88  mev which are in agreement with the experimentally observed values of @xmath89  mev and @xmath90  mev within the error of @xmath86 0.15 mev due to the resolution effects .",

    "a more accurate solution was extracted by fitting the energy scans at ( 6,0,1 ) and ( 6,0,2 ) by the fifth - order one - triplon dispersion shifted by half a period .",
    "this yielded @xmath93 mev and @xmath94 .",
    "as found in the previous section numerical computations of the instrumental resolution function using the rescal software show that the data at base temperature are described entirely by the resolution function .",
    "conventionally the gaussian function is used to characterize the instrumental resolution function .",
    "the energy scans at dispersion minima at ( 8,0,0 ) and ( 6,0,1 ) at @xmath70  k were fitted by using the conventional gaussian function ( dashed green line in fig .",
    "[ smfig2 ] ) .",
    "the extracted full width at half maximum ( @xmath72 ) was found to be of @xmath95 mev for the instrument settings that were used and is associated with the instrumental resolution broadening .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the calculated value of 0.74  mev and the value of @xmath96  mev that was used in the dmrg and dba - cut calculations at finite temperatures to take into account the resolution broadening .",
    "however the conventional gaussian function does not reproduce the asymmetry of the line shape of the instrumental resolution function which was experimentally observed to be weighted towards the center of the band and was numerically reproduced using the rescal software ( see previous section ) . at finite temperatures , where the intrinsic line shape broadens and can also become asymmetric , contributions from both the resolution and this intrinsic line shape broadening combine to produce the observed asymmetric shape of the peak .",
    "therefore , it is important to distinguish the asymmetry due to the resolution from that due to the intrinsic line shape .",
    "this was achieved by introducing an asymmetric gaussian function to analytically describe the instrumental resolution function .",
    "this function is based on a normalized gaussian , where @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath97 and @xmath74 describes the asymmetry of the instrumental resolution function @xmath98 here @xmath78 denotes the peak position .      to quantitatively describe the asymmetry of the instrumental resolution function , the energy scans at the dispersion minima ( 6,0,1 ) and ( 8,0,0 ) at the base temperature of 3.5  k",

    "higher expansion orders enhance the resolution since the broadening is inversely proportional to the expansion order . for further details of this approach",

    "equations   and   now offer two different schemes for the computation of the spectral function . in the first case of eq .  , @xmath114 is specified prior to one single calculation in momentum space .",
    "more flexibility is provided by the scheme suggested in eq .  .",

    "moreover , we exploit the reflection symmetry of the system for @xmath119 .",
    "the latter computation scheme is therefore advantageous in order to obtain the dmrg results along various directions in @xmath114 space shown in fig.2 of the main text .",
    "for these zero - temperature data we retain a maximal internal mps bond dimension of @xmath121 . in each chebyshev",
    "iteration the error resulting from the variational compression is @xmath122 .",
    "since there are two screw chains with different winding orientation in each bacu@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 unit cell , the results are obtained as a superposition of both screw chains .    in the @xmath123 case ,",
    "we exploit a liouville - space formulation for the frequency - space dynamics which can be implemented as a chebyshev expansion for the liouville operator in a dmrg framework @xcite .",
    "this approach is used to approximate the finite - temperature dynamical spin structure factor given by @xmath124 here @xmath125 denotes the canonical partition function and @xmath126 the boltzmann constant . at @xmath123 , it is computationally more expensive to compute the expansion coefficients that are also called chebyshev moments . for details on this issue refer to ref .",
    "we therefore calculate only about 1000 moments using a higher mps bond dimension ( @xmath127 ) than at @xmath106 , leading to a compression error of @xmath128 .",
    "the computation proceeds directly in momentum space , i.e. , by means of the finite - temperature analogue of eq .  .",
    "subsequently , we extrapolate these computed moments with linear prediction  @xcite in order to obtain a higher resolution allowing for a direct comparison to the experiments in fig.3 of the main text . for time - dependent dmrg , linear prediction is an established method @xcite and it has recently also been extended to determine chebyshev moments @xcite . in order to assess the quality of the extrapolation at a given temperature , we varied the input parameters for the linear prediction , e.g. , the number of computed chebyshev moments and the training interval .",
