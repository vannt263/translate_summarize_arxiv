    "adding an electron into a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) produces a variation in the energy of the system that depends on single - particle quantum confinement as well as on the coulomb interaction between carriers.@xcite understanding such _ addition - energy spectrum _ is a key step towards controlling the physics of single - electron devices .",
    "at the same time , the addition spectra of quantum dots offer a unique probe of few - particle interactions in regimes that are not experimentally accessible in atomic physics .",
    "the experimental effort in this direction has developed very rapidly after the recent fabrication of controlled small - qd devices based on gated vertical heterostructures@xcite or self - assembled dots.@xcite the resulting addition spectra show a clear shell structure , corresponding to the symmetries of the confining potential , with a filling sequence analogous to hund s rule in atomic physics .    from the theoretical point of view , a general interpretation of these features was obtained by calculating the energy spectrum for a strictly two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dot , and using either exact methods ( for very few electrons ) , or approximate usually hartree - fock methods.@xcite the assumption of a purely 2d model was initially motivated by the typical disk - like shape of the qd potential , whose extension along @xmath0 is ( slightly ) smaller than the lateral extension of the carrier ground state in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "if one adopts a separable picture for the qd confining potential , @xmath2 , the relevant ( i.e. lowest ) single - electron states can be all associated to the ground state of @xmath3 . from the point of view of single - particle states",
    "the 2d assumption is therefore justified .    in view of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) nature of the coulomb interaction",
    ", however , the 2d model introduces additional approximations in the calculation of the coulomb integrals , which are sensitive to the spatial extension 2d vs. 3d of the single - particle wave functions.@xcite in turn , coulomb integrals control electron - electron correlation , and influence the quantitative determination of addition spectra and their dependence on magnetic field . at the same time , the strength of coulomb interaction is also the key parameter determining the accuracy and range of validity of the approximations which must be introduced for dots with many electrons .    in this paper",
    "we investigate theoretically the addition spectra of realistic qd structures , with special emphasis on the effects of electron - electron repulsion and their dependence on the geometry and dimensionality of the confining potential . in sect .",
    "[ general ] , we compare different approximate solutions of the general hamiltonian for @xmath4 interacting electrons confined in a qd structure ; in particular we consider the single - site hubbard ( ssh ) scheme introduced in ref .  , and the standard hartree - fock ( hf ) method .    in sect .",
    "[ elio ] , we focus on the simplest case , i.e. , a two - electron system within a parabolic confining potential , and calculate the exact energy eigenvalues and pair correlation functions for the 2d and 3d case . as in ref .  , we use this prototypical system called artificial or qd helium as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of the different approximation schemes : we find that both the importance of corrections beyond hf and the differences between hf and ssh are drastically reduced for a realistic 3d description of the dot with respect to its 2d modelization , mainly as a consequence of the reduced coulomb integrals .",
    "this suggests the reliability of a fully 3d mean field treatment of semiconductor qds .",
    "section [ results ] is then devoted to the application of hf and ssh methods to 3d and 2d quantum dots with a larger number of electrons .",
    "we compare both methods for qd structures of different geometries and demonstrate that ssh is an accurate and efficient scheme for realistic , i.e. 3d - like , dots .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of recent experimental data vs magnetic field in qd structures and draw some conclusions .",
    "our aim is to describe @xmath4 electrons , confined in a qd structure ( with harmonic in - plane confining potential ) and interacting via coulomb law , possibly in the presence of an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the general @xmath4-particle hamiltonian is @xmath5 where the single particle hamiltonian , within the effective mass approximation , is @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the vector potential , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the scalar dielectric costant and the effective electron mass in the semiconductor , @xmath10 is the characteristic oscillator frequency of the in - plane confining potential , and @xmath3 is the confining potential along @xmath0 ; @xmath3 can be chosen either as a harmonic potential ( @xmath11 ) , a square well or a zero - width infinite barrier to describe spherical , cylindrical or disk - shaped qd structures , respectively . here",
    "zeeman coupling between spin and magnetic field has been neglected .",
    "this general hamiltonian can be written in second quantized form on the complete and orthonormalized basis of single particle states @xmath12 here @xmath13 are the eigenenergies of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the creation and destruction operators for an electron with orbital index @xmath17 and spin @xmath18 ; @xmath19 are the two - body matrix elements of the electron - electron interaction @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the single particle eigenfunctions .",
    "it is useful to isolate among the coulomb matrix elements the `` semi - diagonal '' ones , namely @xmath22 @xmath23 these are the usual direct and exchange integrals which can be written more explicitely as @xmath24 @xmath25 in this way eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgen ] ) becomes @xmath26 where the prime on the first summation is to omit the terms with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq : ssh}\\ ] ] the relevance of this formal partition is twofold : i ) it naturally leads to a perturbation expansion in the off - diagonal interactions which are in general smaller than the semi - diagonal ones ; ii ) moreover , the _ unperturbed _ term @xmath32 is one - body like , with single slater determinants as _ exact _ eigenstates . the ssh approach defined in ref .",
    "consists in assuming @xmath33 , which amounts to neglecting the second and higher order contributions in the off - diagonal interactions , the first order one being exactly zero .",
    "the assumption that the off - diagonal @xmath34 are negligible with respect to the semi - diagonal ones is implicit in all the methods which describe electron correlation in terms of the hubbard model , either in its original form,@xcite including only on - site interaction between opposite spin electrons proportional to @xmath35 , or adding the interaction between parallel spin electrons as well , proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "the important point here is that when the hubbard model is applied to an isolated qd , i.e.  to a single site , the hubbard hamiltonian turns out to be one - particle like : this is so because the inter - site hopping of the traditional hubbard hamiltonian is absent in this case and the commutator @xmath37 $ ] is zero . as a consequence ,",
    "the slater determinants , eigenstates of the single particle hamiltonian @xmath14 , are exact eigenstates of @xmath32 as well .    within the ssh approach the total energy of @xmath4 electrons in a qd structure",
    "is given by @xmath38        \\langle \\hat{n}_{\\alpha \\sigma } \\rangle , \\label{eq : e}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a slater determinant , eigenvector of @xmath14 , and @xmath40 denotes the average over the many - particle eigenstate , which in our case simply reduces to the orbital occupation number .",
    "the proposed ssh approach shares in common with hartree - fock methods the form of the total energy , which in both schemes is expressed as the average of the exact hamiltonian over a single slater determinant ; the variational prescription allowing for the construction of optimal single - particle orbitals through the selfconsistent solution of a single - particle eigenvalue problem is not present in the ssh approach .",
    "we notice however that the importance of self - consistency is strongly related to the relative weight of coulomb matrix elements : the hf potential entering the self - consistent hf one - particle hamiltonian is in fact related to the direct and exchange coulomb integrals ; similarly the ssh approximation is exact without any need of self - consistency whenever the higher - order contributions from the off - diagonal coulomb matrix elements is negligible .",
    "for this reason we expect that a lower localization of the confined single - particle states in 3d with respect to 2d , giving rise to smaller non - diagonal coulomb integrals , will reduce the difference between hf and ssh results . to check in detail this point we have explicitely performed hf calculations ; we have used in particular the matrix form of the unrestricted hf equation.@xcite    whenever possible , it is obviously useful to compare the outcomes of different approximate schemes with exact results .",
    "this is done in the next section where we consider the exactly solvable two - electron qd ( artificial helium ) in different confinement regimes ; we will show that the differences between hf and ssh results will be always comparable with those between hf and exact results and that they scale with the dimensionality of the confining potential .",
    "in this section we will study the motion of two electrons within a qd structure in two and three dimensions . in this case , the exact hamiltonian ( [ eq : hmanybody ] ) reduces to @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the position of the electron , @xmath43 in 2d or @xmath44 in 3d , and @xmath45 the corresponding momentum .    to solve this equation ,",
    "we perform the standard transformation@xcite to center of mass ( cm ) coordinates , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and relative - motion ( rm ) coordinates , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the two - body hamiltonian thus splits into a cm and a rm part : @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the cm hamiltonian @xmath55 has the form of a simple harmonic oscillator . for the rm hamiltonian , @xmath56 , it is easy to separate variables and obtain a radial differential equation , which gives solutions with the same set of quantum numbers as for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "solutions and notations for the 2d and 3d case are summarized in appendix a for both @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    by denoting the cm and rm quantum numbers with capital and small letters respectively",
    ", the eigenvalues for the two - particle system can be written as @xmath57 in the 2d case , and @xmath58 in the 3d spherical case , the cylindrical 3d helium qd reducing to an effective 2d one ( see appendix [ appa ] ) . here",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the rm eigenvalues in 2d and 3d , respectively .",
    "note that degeneracy is strongly reduced by coulomb interaction with respect to the non - interacting case .",
    "the corresponding two - particle total eigenfunctions are @xmath61 for 2d and the 3d cylinder , and @xmath62 for a 3d sphere . here",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the spatial cm and rm eigenfunctions , and @xmath65 is the spin function of a state with total spin @xmath66 and @xmath0 projection @xmath67 .",
    "note that the parity of the rm spatial eigenfunction is defined ( total orbital angular momentum and spin are conserved ) and connected with the value of total spin by the antisymmetry of the two - particle total wavefunction @xmath68 . for both the disk and the cylinder , this implies that if @xmath69 is even , the state is a singlet ( @xmath70 ) , and if @xmath69 is odd , the state is a triplet ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "similarly for the sphere case , if @xmath72 is even , the state is a singlet ( @xmath70 ) , and if @xmath72 is odd , the state is a triplet ( @xmath71 ) .    in the above eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the two - electron dot",
    ", the ingredients related to the cm hamiltonian are known analytically ( see appendix [ appa ] ) , while the rm energies and wavefunctions must be determined numerically .",
    "this is done by exact diagonalization of the rm eigenvalue problem ( appendix [ appa ] ) , thereby yielding the full 2d and 3d spectrum of the qd helium .    before comparing these exact results with the ssh approach ,",
    "we point out that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h2e ] ) can be translated into a second - quantized form ; this is done in terms of the same quantum numbers using cm and rm variables .",
    "the two - particle hilbert space is the kronecker product of cm and rm single - particle spaces , generated respectively by the basis @xmath73 ( with eigenvalues @xmath74 and creation operators @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 ( with eingenvalues @xmath77 and creation operators @xmath78 ) . for simplicity , @xmath4 and @xmath79 label here the whole set of cm and rm quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "the second - quantized form of the two - particle hamiltonian @xmath80 , in this variables , is then given by @xmath81 this formulation allows us to obtain the result of the previously discussed hubbard model , by simply neglecting all off - diagonal matrix elements in equation ( [ h : pert ] ) : @xmath82 i.e.  manifestly the non interacting hamiltonian `` renormalized '' by coulomb interaction .    in order to check the reliability of the approximations and the role of dimensionality of the confining potential we have calculated ground state properties for qd s with different confinement energies , i.e.  different values of @xmath83 , assuming either a 2d or a 3d confining potential .",
    "the quality of the ground - state eigenfunctions can be probed by the spatial pair correlation function @xmath84 : @xmath85 because of the circular symmetry , @xmath86 depends only on the modulus of the relative distance @xmath87 . here , the factor @xmath88 is chosen in such a way that , if we define the dimensionless relative distance @xmath89 , the quantity @xmath90 for the 2d and the 3d cylinder case , and @xmath91 for a 3d sphere is normalized : @xmath92 we have calculated this quantity both exactly and according to the ssh scheme for a in - plane confining energy @xmath93=5 mev ( throughout the paper we use @xmath94 0.065 @xmath95 inside the dot and @xmath94",
    "0.079 @xmath95 outside , @xmath96 12.98 , as in the qd of ref .",
    "; @xmath95 is the electronic mass ) ; the results are shown in fig .",
    "the deviations between ssh and exact results clearly depend on the dimensionality of the confining potential : in disk - shaped 2d qd s the ssh approximation is found to overestimate the probability of finding the two electrons close together , in analogy with hf results;@xcite the differences between exact and ssh results are significantly reduced assuming a 3d confining potential .",
    "this result is coherent with what is found for other ground - state properties : fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the ground - state energies calculated for dots with different confinement energies , @xmath83 , in the range between 4.5 and 10 mev .",
    "we compare the exact results with the outcomes of hf and ssh calculations assuming 2d and 3d confinement potentials .",
    "notice that the differences between hf and ssh are always smaller by approximately 50% than the corresponding differences with respect to the exact results ; moreover the 3d confinement reduces the overall deviation of both hf and ssh by about 60% .",
    "since the ssh scheme is exact at the first perturbative order in the off - diagonal matrix elements of the e - e interaction , it is interesting to check the importance of the next perturbative corrections .",
    "details of how the perturbative expansion is actually performed for the helium qd are reported in appendix [ perturbation ] .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] reports exact and ssh ground - state energies compared with the results of second order perturbation theory , showing that second - order corrections become much smaller if a 3d confinement is assumed .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when considering dots with smaller confinement energies : in this case the hf and ssh differ from the exact result not only quantitatively but also qualitatively , predicting the two - particle ground state to be a triplet instead of a singlet , as it should be .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) where again the exact , hf and ssh results are shown for dots of different confinement energies .",
    "the difference between triplet and singlet state energies decreases with increasing confinement energy both for ssh and hf approximations until a crossover occurs ; assuming a 3d confining potential the confinement energy of this crossover is reduced , and this again is true both for ssh and hf approximations .",
    "we may summarize this analysis on helium qd by concluding that the assumed 3d confinement potential reduces the differences between approximate ( ssh and hf ) solutions with respect to the exact ones , both in terms of ground - state eigenfunctions and eigenenergies .",
    "the key quantity that characterizes single - electron transport into a qd is the addition energy , i.e. , the energy @xmath97 required to place an extra electron into a dot that is initially occupied by @xmath98 electrons .",
    "such quantity , analogous to electron affinity in atomic physics , can be measured experimentally as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the measured voltage increment @xmath99 between successive single - electron tunneling processes i.e .",
    ", between two successive maxima in the conductance peaks at `` magic '' values of @xmath4 corresponding to the filling of complete shells ( @xmath100 ) , as well as to half - shell filling ( e.g. @xmath101 ) .",
    "the existence of these half - shell filling features is reminiscent of hund s rule in atomic physics,@xcite and is intimately related to electron - electron interaction .",
    "the results of ssh theory for the addition - energy variations , @xmath102 , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as a function of the electron number @xmath4 for two different 3d cylindrical quantum dots . here , @xmath97 is obtained as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the ground - state energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) .",
    "as we can see , @xmath105 exhibits peaks corresponding both to complete and half shell filling , thus well reproducing the experimental evidence in ref .. this behaviour is the result of the interplay between single - particle contributions and electron - electron repulsion : the single - particle term favors complete shell filling , while the repulsion among parallel - spin electrons , smaller than the repulsion among opposite - spin ones , makes the configurations with maximum total spin energetically favored ( hund s rule ) .",
    "this is the physical origin of the half shell - filling structure : indeed , adding an electron to a half - filled shell forces the double occupancy of a level ; consequently , @xmath99 is raised by the dominant coulomb repulsion @xmath106 between opposite - spin electrons on the same level .",
    "for some non - closed shell configurations the total spin turns out to be not determined by hund s rule : in particular , for @xmath4=16 we find a ground state with total spin @xmath107=0 .",
    "similar deviations from hund s rule have been found for large electron numbers ( @xmath10820 ) and associated to spin - density - wave instabilities ; for smaller numbers ( @xmath4=16,18 ) the same @xmath107=0 spin - density - wave state has been found to be a low - energy `` spin isomer '' , slightly higher in energy than the ground state configuration.@xcite    from our calculations we may say that the @xmath107=0 configuration in dots with large @xmath4 may be favoured by the reduced repulsion between electrons in high shells : in the fourth shell , for instance , the coulomb integrals @xmath109 relative to orbitals with higher values of the orbital momentum may be smaller than the corresponding terms relating two levels with smaller angular momentum ; the double occupation of an orbital with high orbital momentum @xmath69 ( i.e. , the level with @xmath79=0 , @xmath69=3 , see app .  [ appa ] for the notation ) with antiparallel - spin electrons may therefore cost less than having parallel - spin electrons on different degenerate orbitals , but with smaller @xmath69 ( i.e. , the level @xmath79=1 , @xmath69=1 ) .",
    "the same interplay also explains the peaks in @xmath105 for @xmath11014 and @xmath4=18.@xcite    we want to stress that also in the case of many electrons the reliability of the results of ssh approach is comparable with hf ones . the explicit comparison between the addition energy variation calculated according to ssh and hf schemes and for 2d and 3d confinements",
    "is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , showing that @xmath99 always peaks at the same electron numbers and that the agreement between ssh and hf results improves on going from the 2d to the 3d confinement model .",
    "ground - state configurations and filling rules change when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "it affects both single particle energies and coulomb and exchange integrals through the induced changes in the wavefunction localization .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the @xmath111- and @xmath112- integrals vs.  @xmath113 for the first states , obtained for @xmath93=7.5 mev . for comparison",
    ", we also show the corresponding quantities calculated within a strictly 2d - confinement model .",
    "we can see that @xmath111-integrals describing the interaction between opposite - spin electrons are a few mev smaller in the case of 3d confinement , while the differences in the interaction between parallel - spin ones are much smaller .",
    "this is going to affect dramatically the energy balance which determines ground - state configurations , thus clearly showing the failure of a pure 2d description of state - of - the - art qd structures .    as already mentioned , according to the ssh approach the off - diagonal matrix elements of the electron - electron interaction",
    "are assumed to be negligible . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the values of two of them are reported as functions of the applied magnetic field .",
    "as expected , we clearly see that for any @xmath113 value they are negligible compared to all the other semi - diagonal contributions , and even more so in 3d with respect to the 2d case .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the total energy @xmath114 as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath113 for different values of the electron number @xmath4 in a dot with confinement energy @xmath93=7.5 mev .",
    "it appears that for sufficiently large values of @xmath113 the hamiltonian term linear in the magnetic field becomes dominant , making configurations with higher total angular quantum number energetically favorable .",

    "other authors have explicitely considered the question of dimensionality in theoretical modelization of semiconductor qds .",
    "et al._@xcite  computed self - consistently the one - particle confining potential in a square qd .",
    "according to their results , our assumption of an in - plane parabolic confining potential plus a well in the perpendicular direction is seen to be quite reliable and general , as well as the _ ansatz _ of considering only the ground state motion along @xmath0 , at least for few electron dots .",
    "et al._@xcite  pointed out the importance of a full 3d model to treat spin density excitations ( sdes ) in semiconductor wires and dots .",
    "specifically , they used the analogous of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cdef ] ) as effective 3d coulomb interaction , and they found that a 2d description artificially enhances the interaction strenght and is unable to predict experimental raman spectra .",
    "the necessity of a 3d modelization is then seen to emerge not only in the description of ground state and single particle processes , like addition spectra , but also in two particle processes , like sdes .",
    "we have presented a theoretical investigation of coulomb - correlation effects in semiconductor quantum dots . in particular , we have performed a detailed analysis of the addition - spectrum problem for few - electron quantum - dot structures ( macroatoms ) , pointing out possible analogies with more conventional coulomb - correlation effects in atomic physics .    our primary goal was to understand to which extent the various approximation schemes , such as hartree - fock or hubbard models , are able to properly describe coulomb correlation in realistic , state - of - the - art qds . to this end , we have first compared approximate results to the exact solution for the prototypical case of a two - electron system , the so - called quantum - dot helium ; we have repeated such analysis for different dimensionalities , considering the 3d ( spherical and cylindrical geometry ) and the pure 2d structures .",
    "the main result is that the degree of accuracy of any approximation scheme depends strongly on the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "more specifically , the pure 2d model often used for the description of quantum dots is found to give approximated results which differ significantly from the exact solution .",
    "we have demonstrated that this is not a general failure of the approximation scheme , but it reflects a rather pathological behaviour originating from the unphysical nature of the pure 2d model .",
    "indeed , for the case of a 3d cylindrical model which provides a much better description of realistic qd structures the difference between exact solution and approximated results is found to be much smaller , thus confirming the validity of the various approximation schemes considered .",
    "the same analysis has been then extended to many - electron systems for which addition - spectra measurements are available . using different approximation schemes , we find that the deviations between the full 3d and the simplified 2d quantum - dot model are very significant . the full 3d model is found to reproduce the experimental data for a large class of qd structures where simplified 2d models fail . we conclude that this is due to the unphysical character of the pure 2d confinement for which the various approximation schemes often yield unreliable results . a proper description of the qd structure in terms of fully 3d single - particle wavefunctions is therefore required ;",

    "<S> we study the energy spectra of small three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor quantum dots through different theoretical approaches ( single - site hubbard and hartree - fock hamiltonians ) ; in the smallest dots we also compare with exact results . </S>",
    "<S> we find that purely 2d models often lead to an inadequate description of the coulomb interaction existing in realistic structures , as a consequence of the overestimated carrier localization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dimensionality of the dots has a crucial impact on ( i ) the accuracy of the predicted addition spectra ; ( ii ) the range of validity of approximate theoretical schemes . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to realistic 3d geometries , the latter are found to be much more accurate than in the corresponding 2d cases for a large class of quantum dots ; the single - site hubbard hamiltonian is shown to provide a very effective and accurate scheme to describe quantum dot spectra , leading to good agreement with experiments . </S>"
