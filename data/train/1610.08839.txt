    "quantum entanglement stands amongst the fundamental properties of nature at the microscopic level .",
    "this quantum - mechanical feature was concerned by founders in the schrdinger `` cat paradox '' paper @xcite and in the einstein  podolsky ",
    "rosen paper @xcite . due to the role of entanglement in quantum information science , related questions are currently the subject of active research ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite and references therein ) . due to progress in quantum information processing ,",
    "both the detection and quantification of entanglement are very important . in the case of discrete variables ,",
    "the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite and the reduction criterion @xcite are very powerful . on the other hand ,",
    "no universal criteria are known even for discrete variables .",
    "say , the ppt criterion is necessary and sufficient for @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems , but ceases to be so in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "separability conditions can be derived from uncertainty relations of various forms @xcite .",
    "these studies concerned finite - dimensional quantum systems . for systems with continuous variables , detection of entanglement is more challenging task .",
    "reasons for studying quantum information with continuous variables are originated in the fact that many quantum protocols can be efficiently implemented within current technologies of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "due to a practical importance , gaussian states were well studied from the viewpoint of entanglement detection @xcite .",
    "properties of gaussian entanglement with respect to information processing were discussed in @xcite .",
    "entanglement criteria of the second - order type deal with variations of certain observables . for systems with continuous variables ,",
    "such criteria were proposed in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite formulated an infinite hierarchy of conditions for positive partial transpose involving higher - order moments .",
    "the conditions of @xcite were later amended in @xcite .",
    "such conditions provide a very powerful criterion , which is rather hard for implementation in experimental practice .",
    "the authors of @xcite have formulated biseparability conditions in terms of differential entropies related to measurement statistics .",
    "this methods differs from some previous studies , in which entropies of density operators were considered @xcite . in particular , inequalities with rnyi entropies of density matrices can be treated as a condition for local realism @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite studied the relation between entanglement properties and conditional rnyi and tsallis entropies for bipartite quantum systems in finite dimensions .",
    "many covariance - matrix - based criteria and shannon - entropy criteria can be unified within a general formalism proposed in @xcite .",
    "when more than two parties are involved , the structure of entanglement is much richer in comparison with the bipartite case @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite developed a general framework for constructing multipartite entanglement witnesses .",
    "separability eigenvalue equations of @xcite allow to witness partial and full entanglement in multipartite composed systems .",
    "this basic techniques has been applied to examine multipartite entanglement of frequency - comb gaussian states @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there are two - separable states which include all other forms of higher - order entanglement .",
    "this example illustrates significance of studying different categories of multipartite entanglement . in practice",
    ", we would often like to detect the entanglement of states that are partially or completely unknown . in this case ,",
    "desired entanglement criteria should immediately be related to results of some measurements specially built for such purposes .",
    "another approach is to construct the density operator via quantum tomography , but quantum tomography usually requires considerable effort .",
    "the separability problem with partial information was addressed in @xcite .",
    "the formalism of @xcite allows to extend biseparability conditions to multimode case in both discrete- and continuous - variable systems .",
    "the aim of the present work is to formulate @xmath0-separability conditions for an @xmath0-partite system with continuous variables in terms of generalized entropies .",
    "we also study derived entanglement criteria from the viewpoint of sampling density functions into bins .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the required material is presented .",
    "entropic functionals of the rnyi type are briefly discussed .",
    "further , we recall young s inequality and its converse , both formulations with sharp constants . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we formulate rnyi - entropy entanglement criteria for a bipartite quantum system with continuous variables .",
    "the global observables are constructed within a commonly accepted approach to deriving separability conditions for such systems . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we examine the presented separability conditions from the viewpoint of their use in practice of quantum information processing .",
    "appropriate reformulations are given for sampling measurement statistics into prescribed bins .",
    "in this case , separability conditions in terms of tsallis entropies are also given .",
    "a utility of the derived criteria is discussed with a concrete example .",
    "it is motivated that separability conditions in terms of generalized entropies lead to more robust detection of entanglement .",
    "in this section , we recall the required material and describe the notation .",
    "let @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 be probability density function of some continuous variable .",
    "then the differential shannon entropy is defined as @xcite @xmath5 there are several fruitful generalizations of the standard shannon entropy . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the differential rnyi entropy is written as @xmath7 this entropy is a continuous analog of the @xmath8-entropy introduced by rnyi in @xcite .",
    "such entropies of discrete random variable will be used , when continuous variable is sampled into chosen bins .",
    "let the bins be specified by the set of marks @xmath9 .",
    "hence , we have the intervals @xmath10 with the maximum @xmath11 .",
    "we then introduce probabilities @xmath12 to get a good exposition , the size of bins should be sufficiently small in comparison with a scale of considerable changes of @xmath4 . for the discrete distribution with probabilities ( [ qivx ] ) ,",
    "its rnyi @xmath8-entropy is defined as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath6 . in the limit @xmath14",
    ", we obtain the usual shannon entropy @xmath15 of course , we mean the usual definition @xmath16 here .",
    "many interesting properties of rnyi entropies with applications are discussed in @xcite .",
    "to pose required mathematics formally , we now introduce convenient norm - like functionals . for arbitrary @xmath17 , one defines @xmath18 of course , we will further assume that such integrals exist .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ alpnrm ] ) gives a legitimate norm only for @xmath19 .",
    "the case @xmath20 is allowed and leads to the essential supremum of functions @xcite .",
    "for the given discrete distribution and @xmath17 , we also define @xmath21 including @xmath22 . the @xmath8-entropy ( [ redenw ] ) is then rewritten as @xmath23 in a similar manner , we express ( [ rpdf ] ) in terms of ( [ qanrm ] ) . due to @xmath24 ,",
    "for @xmath25 we clearly have @xmath26 hence , rnyi entropies of discrete probability distributions are always positive including zero for deterministic distributions .",
    "this is not the case for differential entropies of the form ( [ redenw ] ) . despite of the normalization @xmath27 , we can not generally write a continuous counterpart of ( [ albe1 ] ) .",
    "in other words , the quantity ( [ redenw ] ) is not of definite sign and becomes negative for density functions with sufficiently large variations .",
    "nevertheless , relations with such entropies may express non - trivial conditions .",
    "for instance , the differential shannon entropy of phase with negative values was considered in @xcite .",
    "differential entropies are also an intermediate point in obtaining conditions for entropies with binning .",
    "to obtain entanglement criteria , we will use several mathematical results for functions of one scalar variable .",
    "first , we recall the hausdorff  young inequality with sharp constants . the question concerns relations between norms of a function and its fourier transform .",
    "the sharp hausdorff  young inequality was found by beckner @xcite with using the previous result of babenko @xcite .",
    "we recall this result in a reformulation convenient for our aims .",
    "it deals with probability density functions and leads to entropic uncertainty relations for the position and momentum @xcite .",
    "so , the hausdorff  young inequality with sharp constants leads to an improvement of the first entropic uncertainty relation of hirschman @xcite .",
    "let two functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 be connected by the fourier transform , namely @xmath30 they are treated as wave functions in the position and momentum spaces , respectively . here , we accepted units in which @xmath31 .",
    "the probability density functions are written as @xmath32 introducing the fourier transform by means of ( [ phpdf ] ) is physically motivated . at the same time , the formula ( [ phpdf ] ) slightly differs from the definition commonly used in mathematical literature .",
    "so , we should rewrite the corresponding inequality of beckner @xcite in terms of the above wave functions and further convert it into relations between probability density functions .",
    "we refrain from presenting the details here since this point has been addressed , e.g. , in the papers @xcite .",
    "the result is posed as follows .",
    "let positive indices @xmath8 and @xmath33 be constrained as @xmath34 , and let @xmath25 . for any quantum state ,",
    "norm - like functionals of the position and momentum densities then obey @xmath35 here , the positive parameter @xmath36 is given be the formula @xmath37 it will be convenient to parameterize constrained indices @xmath8 and @xmath33 as @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 $ ] . by calculations ,",
    "we then get @xmath41 the relations ( [ wuxp ] ) and ( [ uwpx ] ) hold , when wave functions are related via the fourier transform with infinite limits .",
    "the corresponding observables obey the position - momentum commutation relation and have eigenvalues covering the real axis .",
    "note that the sharp hausdorff  young inequality _ per se _ implies ( [ wuxp ] ) and ( [ uwpx ] ) only for pure states .",
    "however , they can immediately be extended to mixed states .",
    "the `` twin '' relations ( [ wuxp ] ) and ( [ uwpx ] ) leads to uncertainty relations in terms of rnyi s entropies as described in @xcite .",
    "dealing with convolutions , we should recall young s inequality with sharp constants .",
    "it was found by beckner @xcite and by brascamp and lieb @xcite with the use of different methods .",
    "we will closely follow the formulation of brascamp and lieb , since they also gave the converse of young s inequality with sharp constants . to each real index @xmath42",
    ", we assign the conjugate index @xmath43 such that @xmath44 the young inequality involves factors of the form @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 by @xmath47 , we will mean the convolution of two functions of one scalar variable .",
    "let the indices be such that @xmath48 and their conjugate ones obey @xmath49 for the convolution of @xmath0 functions , one has @xmath50 more results about the young inequality as well as the hausdorff  young inequality can be found , e.g. , in chapters 4 and 5 of the book @xcite .",
    "inequalities converse to ( [ yin1n ] ) generally involve indices , some of which are negative . here , the definition should be reformulated . if indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 are conjugate in the sense of ( [ nunup ] ) , then @xcite @xmath53 when @xmath54 , the conjugate index @xmath52 is strictly negative . to emphasize this distinction",

    "let the indices be such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the convolution of @xmath0 one - dimensional functions , we have @xcite @xmath57 this issue is connected with some previous results of leindner and prkopa ( see , e.g. , references in @xcite ) . calculating with factors of the form ( [ anuf ] ) and ( [ anuf1 ] )",
    ", we will often use the expression @xmath58 in the following , both the inequalities ( [ yin1n ] ) and ( [ cyin1n ] ) will be used in deriving separability conditions .",
    "one form of the minkowski inequality will also be recalled when appropriate . concerning this inequality ,",
    "see corresponding sections of the book by hardy et al . @xcite .",
    "in this section , we obtain @xmath0-separability conditions for an @xmath0-partite quantum system with continuous variables . let subsystems of an @xmath0-partite system be labeled by @xmath59 .",
    "the product @xmath60 is the total hilbert space .",
    "any quantum state of the total system is given by a density matrix @xmath61 on @xmath62 .",
    "density matrices are assumed to be normalized .",
    "we note that @xmath0-fold product states of the form @xmath63 have no correlations between subsystems .",
    "recall that a bipartite mixed state @xmath64 is called separable , when its density matrix can be written as a convex combination of product states @xcite . for an @xmath0-partite system , we call @xmath61 to be @xmath0-separable , when it can be represented as a convex combination of product states of the form @xmath63 .",
    "such states are often called fully separable @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", each separable state will be treated as a convex combination of only pure product states .",
    "this point follows from the existence of the spectral decomposition .    to formulate entanglement criteria , appropriate global observables",
    "should be built from local ones @xcite .",
    "let us first recall formulations for a bipartite system . to each subsystem @xmath65 , one assigns the position and momentum variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 so that @xmath68={{\\mathtt{i}}}{\\openone}_{\\ell}$ ] , where @xmath69 is the identity on @xmath70 .",
    "further , we introduce the operators @xmath71 parametrized by the angle @xmath72 .",
    "it is easy to check that these operators also obey @xmath73={{\\mathtt{i}}}{\\openone}_{\\ell}$ ] .",
    "the above formulas describe linear canonical transformations in phase space and correspond to unitary transformations of the hilbert space @xcite .    using the signs @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ", we now consider the observables @xmath76 the observables @xmath77 and @xmath78 are commuting and jointly measurable .",
    "let @xmath79 s be eigenkets of @xmath80 normalized through dirac s delta function .",

    "for the given state @xmath64 , the density of interest should be obtained from the function @xmath83 the authors of @xcite used the following principal observation . for arbitrary product state @xmath84 , the final density ( [ wevr ] ) is the convolution of local densities . denoting @xmath85",
    ", we actually get @xmath86 .",
    "then the probability density function of variable @xmath87 reads @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "also , the convolution @xmath90 takes place for product states . using this fact",

    "to derive biseparability conditions in terms of generalized entropies , the authors of @xcite used young s inequality and its converse with sharp constants .",
    "entropy power inequalities of the rnyi type with improved coefficients depend , in particular , on number and dimensionality of involved random vectors @xcite",

    "desired relations in terms of suitable entropies are extracted only at the final step .",
    "it is important that our approach can naturally be combined with young s inequality _ per se_.",
    "it is therefore more direct than appealing to entropy power inequalities .",
    "indeed , the entropy power inequality proved in @xcite are mainly based on young s inequality with sharp constants .",

    "we will first obtain entropic relations for @xmath160 .",
    "the shannon case @xmath161 is reached by taking the corresponding limit .",
    "the rnyi entropies are expressed via norm - like functionals according to ( [ redenw1 ] ) , whence @xmath162 to reach ( [ tw1n ] ) , we take the logarithm of both the sides of ( [ form5 ] ) and use ( [ redenw2 ] ) . the inequality with swapped @xmath120 and @xmath121",

    "such relations merely reflect the fact that the given density function is the convolution of two local densities . to use them in entanglement detection",

    "it should be noted that entropic functions of the form ( [ rpdf ] ) may generally take negative values . here",
    ", a good way is to discretize statistics with respect to some bins .",
    "moreover , experiments typically result in discrete probability distributions obtained by sampling density functions of continuous variables of interest . in each of the two measurements",

    "the discrete distribution @xmath176 is formed by the probabilities ( [ pjdz ] ) .",
    "these probabilities represent chances for corresponding detection positions @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath177 characterizes the width of detectors in @xmath173-space .",
    "similarly , the distribution @xmath178 is obtained by sampling @xmath121 with respect to bins between marks @xmath179 so that @xmath10 and @xmath11",

    "second , we can construct approximations to the original probability distributions @xmath180 and @xmath181 : @xmath182 that is , we replace the original probability distributions by approximate continuous distribution in the form of histogram functions .",

    "measurement devices inevitably suffer from losses .",

    "we assign a `` distorted '' distribution such that @xmath201 here , the probability @xmath202 corresponds to the no - click event .",
    "we further assume that in both the measurements the inefficiency - free distributions are altered according to ( [ petad ] ) .",
    "so , an efficiency of detection is taken to be equal for all bins . in a certain sense ,",
    "the above formulation coincides with the first model of detection inefficiencies considered by the authors of @xcite in application to cycle scenarios of the bell type . since the separability conditions ( [ tw1bin ] ) and ( [ ts1bin ] ) involve different entropic parameters , we restrict a consideration to the shannon entropies .",

    "if @xmath0-partite state @xmath61 is @xmath0-separable , then @xmath205 thus , detector inefficiencies will produce additional uncertainties in the entropies of actually measured data . with decreasing @xmath206 ,",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ h1bineta ] ) reduces , whereas the second term increases .",
    "when @xmath200 does not approach @xmath172 sufficiently closely , this feature will prevent a robust detection of entanglement .",
    "finally , we shall illustrate a relevance of entanglement criteria with entropic parameters .",

    "further , the family of states ( [ decsf ] ) will be considered for positive real @xmath210 . to study the violation of separability conditions ,",
    "we introduce the characteristic quantity @xmath218 here , the indices @xmath116 and @xmath51 are linked by ( [ algam ] ) and @xmath189 is defined by ( [ clkt ] ) .",

    "the characteristic quantity @xmath212 is drawn in fig . [ fg1 ] for @xmath213 and five values of @xmath116 .",
    "we also restrict a consideration to values @xmath219 $ ] , since an asymptotic behavior already appears on the right sides of curves .",
    "for a very large range of @xmath210 , the separability conditions in terms of rnyi entropies allow to detect entanglement .",
    "we also see that the undetectable region is almost the same for all curves .",
    "although the border of detectable values becomes leftmost for the standard case @xmath220 , this difference is quite small and hardly significant in practice .",
    "indeed , all real devices are inevitably exposed to noise . in opposite , the size of violation essentially depends on entropic indices .",
    "with growth of @xmath116 , the size of violation for sufficiently large @xmath210 is increased more than three times .",
    "thus , separability conditions in terms of generalized entropies lead to more robust detection of entanglement .",
    "the curves were shown for @xmath213 , but for other values @xmath221 we have seen a similar picture .",
    "let us discuss briefly a significance of the size of violation of separability conditions .",

    "moreover , the original density functions @xmath222 and @xmath223 can actually be masked in experiments due to a finiteness of resolution and external noise .",
    "these features can only increase the amount of uncertainty . instead of the theoretical violation ( [ caz12 ] ) , measurements result in another quantity @xmath224 such that @xmath225 .",

    "finally , we shall discuss possible applications of the presented @xmath0-separability conditions in multipartite entanglement detection .",
    "our entanglement criteria are expressed in terms of experimentally measured quantities with the use of sufficiently simple and universal setup . in principle",
    ", states of an @xmath0-partite system may be @xmath226-separable with @xmath227 .",
    "the equality @xmath228 implies that the given state is fully separable .",
    "our separability conditions allow to test full separability immediately .",
    "their violation is sufficient for the conclusion that the tested state is not fully separable .",
    "they may also be used in more complicated manner , when corresponding partial traces of the input @xmath61 will be tested with respect to full separability .",
