    "the study of temporal chaos in low - dimensional systems , some of which can be described by low - dimensional maps @xcite , was extremely beneficial for the understanding of turbulence . in 1984",
    "coupled map lattices were introduced into the physical literature as a tool for studying spatiotemporal chaos in spatially extended , i.e. high - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "they consist of spatially coupled low - dimensional maps and represent dynamical systems that are discrete in space and time , but continuous in the state variable .",
    "they serve as models for coupled josephson junctions , excitable media , population dynamics , neural dynamics and turbulence @xcite .",
    "although bunimovich and sinai mathematically proved a number of statements regarding the appearance of coherent structures from spatiotemporal chaos @xcite , most results in the field have been obtained by numerical simulations @xcite . while the study of temporal chaos has greatly profited from the existence of simple maps like the bernoulli shift map and the cat map @xcite , which can be solved explicitly ( for integer expansion rates ) , thereby making the mechanisms of mixing and temporal chaos understandable ,",
    "no investigation of this type has been provided up to now for the problem of spatiotemporal chaos . here",
    "we present a solvable model for spatiotemporal chaos which can be solved in the sense of the bernoulli map .",
    "we start from the model equations @xcite @xmath0,\\ ] ] where the index @xmath1 runs over the @xmath2 sites of a discrete lattice , @xmath3 measures the strength of the spatial coupling between neighboring sites and @xmath4 is a local map which determines the evolution of the continuous variable @xmath5 at discrete time - steps @xmath6 .",

    "we will show that the coupled map lattice is solvable for special values of the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_cml ] ) and we will also calculate the invariant density and a spatial and a spatiotemporal correlation functions .",
    "finally in section [ sec_discuss ] we discuss our results and indicate directions of further research .",
    "first we recall that the single map @xmath11 can be solved as @xmath12 because @xmath13 \\right\\ }   { \\rm mod}\\;1\\cr = & & \\left\\ { a\\left [ ax^{0}-k^{0}\\right ] \\right\\ }    \\,{\\rm mod}\\;1=(a^{2}x^{0})\\,{\\rm mod}\\;1    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is an integer which represents the action of the modulo function . for the last equality sign in to hold we needed the fact that @xmath10 is an integer such that @xmath15 becomes again an integer , which can be dropped within the last modulo function .",
    "since the modulo function confines the variable @xmath16 to a circle we could view the bernoulli shift map as a linear map @xmath17 where the variables live on a unit circle , i.e. on a 1-torus .",
    "we shall see below that we can view our coupled map system as a linear map acting on variables confined to an @xmath2-torus , where @xmath2 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the invariant density @xmath18 of the simple bernoulli shift map measures the distribution of @xmath19 values on the attractor generated by the map and is well known to be a constant @xcite .",
    "we can obtain this result by noting that @xmath20 is defined on an unit circle , i.e. it is periodic in @xmath19 and therefore can be represented as a fourier series @xmath21 where @xmath22 takes only integer values @xmath23 .",
    "the invariant density @xmath18 evolves from an initial distribution @xmath24 according to the frobenius - perron equation @xcite @xmath25 \\rho^0\\left ( x^{\\prime } \\right)\\ ] ] and is defined as the long - time limit @xmath26 . in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq_dens_sing ] ) we use ( [ eq_four_sing ] ) and the fact that the bernoulli shift map becomes a linear map on a torus , i.e. @xmath27)=\\exp(2\\pi ia^{t}x)$ ] , and obtain @xmath28    if we make the reasonable assumption that the initial distribution @xmath24 is non - singular , then @xmath29 .",
    "this means that in eq .",
    "( [ eq_four_sing ] ) all fourier coefficients of @xmath30 tend to zero in the infinite - time limit , except the one , which belongs to @xmath31 . since @xmath32 this yields @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in a similar fashion",
    "we can now define and calculate the time correlation function on the 1-torus .",
    "the usual time correlation function is defined via @xmath35 where the time evolution of @xmath19 is given by the map @xmath36 , but here we introduce the time correlation function @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 which respects the fact that the variable @xmath19 is an angular variable on a torus @xcite .    for @xmath34",

    "( [ eq_map_mat ] ) can be solved for _ any _ matrix @xmath50 , which has _ integer valued elements _ @xmath52 . in order to see this we write ( [ eq_map_mat ] ) in vector notation as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and the modulo is taken for each component of the vector @xmath55",
    ". then we obtain by iterating from the initial condition : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a vector with integer components which represents the action of the modulo function .",

    "since ( [ eq_mod_iter ] ) holds for any @xmath60 , we obtain the closed - form solution as a function of the initial value @xmath61    eq . ( [ eq_mod_iter ] ) shows that we can solve not only our coupled map lattice problem ( [ eq_map_nnc ] ) , but all linearly coupled systems , where the coupling occurs via a matrix @xmath50 with integer elements @xmath52 and the nonlinearity is provided by the modulo function .",
    "the solution can be obtained by first solving the linear problem , i.e. by obtaining @xmath62 and then taking the modulo , which is the same as having the linear map acting on an @xmath2-torus in analogy to the famous arnold s cat map in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "next we investigate the invariant density and the spatiotemporal correlation function of the coupled map lattice .",
    "the first quantity gives us information about the measurable time averaged spatial structures in the system and the second one tells us about the measurable spatiotemporal structures .",
    "the invariant density @xmath63 yields the distribution of points on the attractor generated by the map @xmath64 . by starting from an initial distribution",
    "@xmath65 it could be obtained as the infinite - time limit of @xmath66 in the frobenius - perron equation @xmath67 \\rho^0({\\bf x}')\\ ] ]    since all quantities involved in eq .",
    "( [ eq_dens_ev ] ) are periodic on an @xmath2-torus , the fourier decomposition of @xmath66 contains only wavevectors @xmath68 with integer components , i.e. @xmath69 by using the equality @xmath70 ) = \\exp(2\\pi i[(a^t)^t{\\bf k}]\\cdot{\\bf x})$ ] eq .",
    "( [ eq_dens_four ] ) yields @xmath71 if the initial distribution @xmath65 is non - singular , all fourier coefficients vanish for large values of the wavevector , i.e. @xmath72    for a completely expanding map , where all eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath50 have an absolute value larger than one , @xmath73 for each @xmath74 and the only non - vanishing fourier component becomes @xmath75 which yields a constant invariant density @xmath76 this result is completely analogous to the single map case .",
    "however we may obtain different results for the invariant density if there are contracting directions in the phase space .",
    "indexing the stable and unstable eigenvalues @xmath77 and right ( left ) eigenvectors @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) of the matrix @xmath80 with indices `` s '' and `` u '' respectively , we have @xmath81 according to the above , we will only obtain results which differ from the trivial expanding case , if there exists at least one @xmath74 , such that its components along the unstable directions are all zero , i.e. it is contained in the stable manifold @xmath82 of the fixed point @xmath83 of the `` conjugate '' map @xmath84    in fact the above argument does not take into account one particular feature of the system .",
    "specifically , the map ( [ eq_conj_map ] ) might not be hyperbolic , i.e. it might possess the _",
    "manifold , defined by the eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath85 .",
    "if this is the case ( and it is for the coupled map lattice ( [ eq_map_nnc ] ) as we shall see below ) , we assume that the invariant density , that we calculate corresponds to the _ physical _ ( or kolmogorov ) _ measure _ @xcite .",
    "the latter is calculated by introducing a small amount of noise into the system and then taking the zero - noise limit .",
    "assuming that the physical measure is unique , we can obtain the invariant density starting from @xmath86 , which is equivalent to @xmath87 .",
    "then only the stable manifold contributes to the invariant density and the central manifold can be treated as the unstable one .",
    "this essentially means , that the averaging over the central directions is accomplished by the infinitely small noise present in the system .    on the other hand , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_fou_comp],[eq_eig_exp ] ) tell us that it is not enough to have contracting eigenvalues in order to get a non - constant invariant density .",
    "let us first consider the case with a single stable direction @xmath88 . since all components @xmath89 of a vector @xmath68 are integer , it is contained within the stable manifold @xmath82 only if @xmath90 .",
    "this in turn means that the components @xmath91 should be mutually rational , i.e. @xmath92    an example where we have one contracting and one expanding direction is the cat map @xmath93 although the eigenvalue corresponding to the contracting direction is @xmath94 , this map still has a constant invariant density because the components of the eigenvector @xmath95 belonging to @xmath96 have a non - rational ratio ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cat ] ) leading to @xmath97    generally , in order to get a non - constant invariant density our model must possess a stable manifold , which in turn should contain at least one vector with mutually rational components .",
    "every vector @xmath98 with integer components , which is pulled in the long time limit into the origin , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_eig_exp ] ) , @xmath99 can be represented as a linear combination of a ( usually small ) number of basis vectors @xmath100 , @xmath101 with integer coefficients @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "the invariant density will only contain non - vanishing fourier components with such wavevectors @xmath104 , all with weight 1 : @xmath105      up to now our conclusions have been completely general for any coupling matrix @xmath50 with integer elements .",
    "let us now consider the condition ( [ eq_pull_in ] ) in more detail for our 1-dimensional nearest neighbor model ( [ eq_map_nnc ] ) .",
    "the corresponding matrix ( [ eq_mat_coup ] ) can be diagonalized by fourier transformation in the space variables @xmath1 , leading for periodic boundary conditions to eigenvalues @xmath106 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .    of these",
    "only a few have mutually rational components .",
    "for instance , both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are rational only if @xmath112 is rational , which immediately restricts the allowed wavevectors @xmath108 to a set of 5 values : @xmath113 .",
    "each @xmath114 generates several basis vectors , provided @xmath115 : @xmath116    rationality of @xmath117 in not an unexpected result , e.g. choosing @xmath118 results in the eigenvalue @xmath119 , according to ( [ eq_evalue ] ) , which requires @xmath120 where we defined @xmath121 with @xmath122 if @xmath123 and @xmath124 otherwise .",
    "this in turn , requires @xmath125 , which is seen to be the case by rewriting ( [ eq_inv_dens ] ) as @xmath126    it is useful to define the projection of the invariant density @xmath127 on a chosen direction @xmath128 : @xmath129 for example , if @xmath130 , eq . ( [ eq_project ] ) gives the distribution of the @xmath131-th map variable @xmath132 .",
    "if @xmath128 coincides with one of the basis directions , i.e. @xmath133 for some @xmath134 , the projection @xmath135 ( @xmath136 denotes the unit @xmath2-dimensional cube ) becomes singular : we get a series of @xmath137-functions with an envelope @xmath138 otherwise , the projection ( [ eq_project ] ) is a continuous , non - singular function of parameter @xmath139 .",
    "in other words , only the projection on the directions defined by the basis vectors @xmath100 is singular .",
    "in particular , the eigenvector @xmath140 defines a basis direction @xmath141 if and only if the projection ( [ eq_project ] ) on this eigenvector ( we define @xmath142 for @xmath143 ) , @xmath144 is singular .",
    "this implies that @xmath145 for some @xmath131 .",
    "one can trivially verify that the projection ( [ eq_eig_proj ] ) has the average @xmath146 and the dispersion given by @xmath147 for all @xmath148 and almost always for @xmath149 .",
    "a few degenerate cases like @xmath150 or @xmath151 for @xmath152 , or @xmath153 for @xmath154 give different dispersions .",
    "as expected , numerically calculating the projection @xmath155 on the stable and unstable directions ( [ eq_evector ] ) , we only get a singular distribution for @xmath156 ( fig . [ fig_narrow](b ) ) , provided that the respective eigenvector is stable ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "otherwise a smooth gaussian - like distribution is obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig_narrow](a ) ) .",
    "indeed one can easily see that in the large - length limit both the continuous distribution and the envelope of the singular distribution ( [ eq_eig_proj ] ) become gaussian : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the normalized gaussian and @xmath160 .",
    "the standard spatial correlation function is trivially calculated to yield @xmath161 for the completely expanding case with @xmath162 ( here @xmath163 denotes the average taken with @xmath63 ) .    if there are contracting directions , we rewrite ( [ eq_corr_fun ] ) as @xmath164 where @xmath165 for all @xmath166 except @xmath167 . since @xmath168 for all @xmath148 , @xmath169    this reduces to a @xmath137-correlation ( which coincides with the result ( [ eq_corr_fun ] ) obtained for @xmath162 ) in all but a few special cases , when @xmath170 .",
    "for instance , choosing @xmath171 and @xmath172 yields for @xmath154 @xmath173 and therefore @xmath174 and @xmath175 , resulting in @xmath176    since the invariant density , although being nontrivial , does not tell us much about the spatiotemporal structures in the system , next we introduce a spatiotemporal correlation function @xmath177 , which is a straightforward generalization of the time correlation function ( [ eq_sing_cor ] ) : @xmath178    by expanding @xmath63 into fourier series we obtain in analogy to ( [ eq_fou_comp ] ) : @xmath179 since only the non - vanishing fourier components @xmath180 ( where @xmath181 ) of the invariant density ( [ eq_inv_dens ] ) contribute , ( [ eq_time_four ] ) reduces to @xmath182 in a translationally invariant system @xmath177 does not depend on @xmath1 , so we drop the index and fix @xmath1 ( set @xmath183 to be specific ) .",
    "it can be easily verified that the correlation ( [ eq_time_cor ] ) is short - ranged in both space and time .",
    "first we note that it vanishes if the vector @xmath184 with components @xmath185 does not lie on the stable manifold @xmath82 .",
    "according to ( [ eq_eig_exp ] ) @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the largest and @xmath188  the next largest eigenvalue and @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the respective eigenvectors . for increasing @xmath60",
    "the vector @xmath184 asymptotically approaches the direction defined by @xmath189 and therefore can not lie on the stable manifold for @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is some finite ( and typically small ) integer .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath193 we have @xmath194 since all basis vectors ( [ eq_basis ] ) are periodic in space with periods 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 6 , any linear combination of these will also be periodic with period of at most 12 .",
    "since the vector with components @xmath195 is _ not _ periodic for @xmath196 , the maximal size of the system with non - trivial correlation is limited by @xmath197 .",
    "again , choosing @xmath171 and @xmath172 for @xmath154 as an example , we have @xmath198 and @xmath199 as basis vectors and consequently @xmath200 i.e. we retrieve the result ( [ eq_corr_4 ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the solution for the dynamical behavior of a lattice of bernoulli maps that are coupled by a matrix @xmath50 with integer coefficients can be given in the closed form as @xmath201 : the dynamical behavior of the coupled map system can be described by the repeated action of a linear map @xmath62 on variables that are confined to an @xmath2-torus .",
    "this picture explains that the essentials of the dynamical behavior are dictated by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath50 .",
    "the invariant density @xmath63 of this system displays fourier coefficients that are different from zero , i.e. is non - constant , whenever the stable manifold of the zero wavevector contains a non - empty basis of directions @xmath100 with mutually rational components , generating the infinite asymptotically contracting set of wavevectors . for nearest neighbor couplings in a 1-dimensional lattice ( given by eq .",
    "[ eq_mat_coup ] ) the maximal number of basis vectors is eight ( actually even less , since , e.g. @xmath202 ) .    we have calculated the standard spatial correlation function @xmath203 for the model with nearest neighbor couplings and shown that it is given by @xmath204 almost always .",
    "a few special cases exist however for sufficiently small lattices , where the spatial correlations are different .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath203 always vanishes at sufficiently large distances .    the invariant density of this system and the spatial correlation function display little structure as compared to the lyapunov spectrum , which is , for the nearest neighbor coupling , given by @xmath205 .",
    "this result shows that the time averaged spatial behavior is _ not _ simply a straightforward reflection of the lyapunov spectrum ( see related work listed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with the general results obtained by bunimovich and sinai @xcite , who proved that , for sufficiently small coupling ( in our case determined by parameter @xmath3 ) , certain expanding coupled map systems with finite - range coupling possess an absolutely continuous invariant measure @xmath207 , and also that the time and space correlation functions decay exponentially ( not slower than exponentially , to be exact ) .",
    "our results indicate , that for larger coupling , the invariant measure still exists , but might not be absolutely continuous due to the fact , that large coupling often causes the appearance of contracting directions , even if the isolated local maps @xmath36 are expanding .",
    "the space and time correlations in our model are seen to decay even faster then exponentially , but the few special cases , giving non - trivial correlations imply that there might be some general relationship between the continuity of the invariant measure and the appearance of coherent structures in the system .",
    "one open problem is the extension of our results to higher dimensions and to couplings which have a longer range . in the 1-dimensional case",
    "the eigenvectors remain also valid for longer - ranged couplings , only the eigenvalues change .",
    "this means that a model with long , but finite , range will have no more structure in the invariant density than the short - ranged model .",
    "this is of course a peculiarity of the bernoulli shift map , but should again be taken as a warning for making conclusions from the spatial range of the coupling onto the observable spatial patterns .",
    "although our solution for the dynamics and the correlation functions hold for general dimensions it would be interesting to see what the restrictions on the wavevectors that generate the basis of the invariant density look like in two and three dimensions .",
    "finally , one could investigate the dynamical behavior of a system , whose time dependence is given a priori by the equation ( [ eq_solution ] ) also for matrices @xmath50 with _ non - integer _",
    "elements . by doing so",
    "one will loose the property of the original map , that the relation relation ( [ eq_map_vec ] ) holds step by step , but the trajectories generated by equation ( [ eq_solution ] ) are well defined .",
