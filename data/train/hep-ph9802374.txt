    "currently there is a great deal of interest in the accurate determination of the running fine structure constant @xmath0 at the scale of the @xmath1 mass  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is of paramount importance for all precision tests of the standard model .",
    "furthermore , an accurate knowledge of @xmath6 is instrumental in narrowing down the mass window for the last missing particle of the standard model , the higgs particle .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the determination of @xmath6 is the hadronic contribution to @xmath2 annihilations needed for this evaluation .",
    "the necessary dispersion integral that enters this calculation has in the past been evaluated by using experimental @xmath2 annihilation data .",
    "disparities in the experimental data between different experiments suggest large systematic uncertainties in each of the experiments . in order to reduce the influence of the systematic uncertainties on the determination of @xmath6",
    "the authors of  @xcite have added theoretical input to the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "global duality states that qcd can be used in weighted integrals over a spectral function if the spectral function is multiplied by polynomials ( i.e.  moments ) but not if multiplied by a singular function such as the weight function @xmath7 in the present case ( see  ( [ eqn3 ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless local duality is expected to hold for very large values of @xmath8 , i.e.  @xmath9 .",
    "the authors of  @xcite use qcd perturbation theory in the form of local duality in the region above @xmath10 for the light flavours .",
    "the authors of  @xcite use perturbative results for energy regions outside the charm and bottom threshold regions . in the respective threshold regions they use renormalized data where the renormalization of the threshold data from each experiment is carried out by comparing with qcd perturbation theory outside of the threshold region .",
    "the authors of  @xcite differ in their treatment of the data .",
    "both of the evaluations suffer from assumptions on the nature of the systematic uncertainties of the data .",
    "our approach is quite different .",
    "we attempt to minimize the influence of data in the dispersion integral over the whole energy region including the threshold regions .",
    "the essence of our method is to diminish the size of the weight function in the dispersion integral by subtracting a polynomial weight function which mimics the weight function in given energy intervals . in order to compensate for this subtraction the same polynomial function",
    "is added again , but now its contribution is evaluated on a large circular contour in the complex plane where perturbative qcd can be safely employed .",
    "as is well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) the hadronic contributions to the effective fine structure constant can be expressed in terms of a weighted dispersion integral over the total @xmath2 hadronic annihilation cross section @xmath11 or , equivalently , over the imaginary part of the correlator of two electromagnetic currents .",
    "our normalization is such that @xmath12 where the four - transverse piece of the current - current correlator @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 the hadronic contribution to the fine structure constant at the scale @xmath15 is determined by the dispersion integral @xmath16 where the weight function @xmath7 is given by @xmath17 the physical threshold for the light @xmath18-quark currents lies at @xmath19 .",
    "the physical threshold for the strange quark is nominally higher but can be lumped together with the @xmath18-quark threshold for our purposes .",
    "henceforth we shall therefore refer to a common light quark threshold of @xmath19 for all three @xmath20-quarks .",
    "for the heavy quark currents we take the masses of the lowest vector quarkonium states as threshold values , i.e. the relevant thresholds values are given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the usual procedure to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) is to substitute the experimental cross section into ( [ eqn2 ] ) up to some high momentum transfer value @xmath23 , and from then on to replace @xmath11 by @xmath24 hoping that qcd furnishes an adequate description of the data above this momentum transfer value . since the weight function in the dispersion integral far from the @xmath1-pole",
    "is essentially given by @xmath25 , the phenomenologically determined low energy part of the dispersion integral dominates over the perturbatively evaluated high energy part making latter substitution quite safe .",
    "we want to make two remarks prompted by this observation .",
    "first , one tests very little of perturbative qcd in such an evaluation even if the data were perfect .",
    "second , a serious drawback of such an evaluation is that the total hadronic @xmath2 annihilation cross section is beset with large systematic errors that will directly feed down to the evaluation of @xmath6 and make such a calculation quite unreliable .",
    "one may thus hope that the inclusion of additional theoretical input on the strong interactions may reduce the resulting error in the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) .    in this paper we shall extend and elaborate on a technique proposed in  @xcite that allows one to substantially enhance the contributions of perturbative qcd to the evaluation of the dispersion integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "let us explain the method for the case of the light @xmath26- , @xmath27- and @xmath8-quarks .",
    "we split the region of integration into two parts , one from the threshold @xmath19 to some large value @xmath23 where perturbative qcd is valid , and the other from @xmath23 to @xmath28 . in practise",
    "we shall further subdivide the interval from @xmath23 to @xmath28 into smaller intervals but this need not concern us here . as the weight function @xmath7 is not an analytic function qcd can not be directly employed in the region @xmath29 , the low energy part of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "the concept of our approach consists in constructing a polynomial function @xmath30 which approximates the function @xmath7 in the energy interval @xmath31 .",
    "the polynomial will be determined by the method of the least squares with possible additional constraints which will be discussed later on .",
    "one then adds and subtracts the polynomial function from the weight function . in the subtracted piece",
    "one achieves a substantial reduction of the influence of the data and their errors on the evaluation of the dispersion integral , whereas the added piece can be evaluated by using perturbative qcd .",
    "accordingly we now proceed to write down an identity for the low energy part of the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) by adding and subtracting the polynomial function @xmath30 in the integrand .",
    "one obtains @xmath32 since the weight function @xmath30 in the second integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) is analytic one can replace the integration on the real axis by an integration on a circle in the complex plane such that one has @xmath33 upon substituting ( [ eqn5 ] ) into ( [ eqn4 ] ) one obtains an _ exact _ sum rule if _ full _ qcd were used to evaluate the different contributions . however , since the full qcd expression for the current - current correlator is not known , we have to use the sum rule in an approximate sense . as explained before the first integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) will be evaluated using the data set given by  @xcite .",
    "the small weight factor @xmath34 will significantly reduce the influence of the experimental data in evaluating the dispersion integral .",
    "the amount of reduction increases with the order @xmath35 of the polynomial @xmath30 that is being used to fit the weight function @xmath7 ( @xmath35 should not be chosen too large as will be explained later on ) .",
    "the second integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) will be evaluated on a circle in the complex plane making use of identity ( [ eqn5 ] ) and state - of - the - art qcd input . in order to be explicit",
    "we evaluate the dispersion integral ( [ eqn2 ] ) between threshold and @xmath23 by the approximate sum rule @xmath36    it is generally believed that the results of perturbative qcd are valid on a circle of large radius in the complex plane , except possibly near the real axis . on the real axis instanton effects are likely to contribute significantly  @xcite , invalidating the use of local duality , except for very large values of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the spectral function of the axial vector current extracted from @xmath37 decay  @xcite differs from the perturbative qcd prediction at @xmath38 up to a factor of three . in order to suppress the contributions to the contour integral close to the real axis we impose the condition that the polynomial @xmath30 vanishes for @xmath39 .",
    "further conditions can be imposed on @xmath30 and are taylored to the specific problem at hand .",
    "for example , in the light quark case we impose the additional condition that the polynomial @xmath30 should coincide with the function @xmath7 in the @xmath40 resonance region so as to suppress the major contribution to the hadronic spectral function . in the heavy quark case to be discussed later on we will require that the difference @xmath41 vanishes at the respective heavy quark thesholds where the quarkonium - resonances accumulate . in this way one can effectively suppress a large part of the experimental input needed for the evaluation of the dispersion integral  ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "it may appear at first glance that , by increasing the degree @xmath35 of the polynomial , the experimental input can be made arbitrary small .",
    "although this would be true for the first integral on the right hand side of the sum rule eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) one has to pay for this when evaluating the second integral where the qcd - input comes into play .",
    "the higher power terms in the polynomial put more and more emphasis on unknown higher order power suppressed terms , such as unknown higher order condensates for the light quarks or unaccounted for higher order terms in the mass expansion of the perturbative contributions of the heavy quarks .",
    "moreover , since the coefficients of the polynomial approximations increase very rapidly with the degree @xmath35 ( with an alternating sign pattern for fixed @xmath35 ) the contributions of the higher order power suppressed terms become even more important as @xmath35 increases .",
    "the restriction on the degree of the polynomial approximation is correlated with the condition that the fitting range should not be too large .",
    "this is particularly true close to the poles of @xmath7 where @xmath7 shows rapid changes . for the light flavours we have therefore decided to move the point of coincidence from the @xmath40 resonance to the point @xmath42",
    "this point is close enough to the @xmath40 resonance to reduce the influence of the data substantially , and large enough to allow meaningful polynomial approximations to @xmath7 in this region of rapid change .",
    "the quality of the polynomial approximations in the light quark region can be judged by looking at fig .",
    "1(a ) where polynomial approximations of different degrees @xmath35 are plotted .",
    "we have checked on the consistency of our procedure by varying interval sizes and other constraints on the polynomial approximations and found no significant changes in the results .",
    "the first region corresponding to the light flavours @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath8 extends from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , close to the charm threshold . in the region near the light quark threshold",
    "the function @xmath7 rises rapidly .",
    "this rise can not be well reproduced by the polynomial approximation , but fortunately the annihilation cross section is very small near the light quark threshold . to obtain a reasonable low @xmath35 polynomial approximation",
    "we therefore minimize @xmath34 only in an interval from close to @xmath45 to @xmath21 apart from the additional conditions remarked on before .",
    "turning to the qcd input for the light quarks we separately list the purely perturbative contributions and the condensate contributions .",
    "for massless quarks the imaginary part of the two - point function is known up to four loops in qcd perturbation theory  @xcite . for the strange quark",
    "we include the @xmath46 power correction to three - loop order  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative contribution to the current - current correlator reads  @xcite @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( for the @xmath51 see below ) .",
    "we have denoted the unknown constant term in the four - loop contribution by @xmath52 .",
    "the constant non - logarithmic terms do not contribute to the circle integrals .",
    "the condensate contributions which we will refer to as the non - perturbative contributions are given by  @xcite @xmath53 where we have included the @xmath54-contribution arising from the unit operator . in this expression we used the @xmath55 colour factors @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the number of active flavours is denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "the result depends logarithmically on the renormalization scale @xmath61 and on the parameters of the theory that are renormalized at the scale @xmath61 .",
    "these are the strong coupling constant , the quark masses and the condensates .",
    "as advocated in  @xcite , we implement the renormalization group improvement for the moments of the electromagnetic correlator by performing the integrations over the circle of radius @xmath39 with constant parameters , i.e.  they are renormalized at a fixed scale @xmath61 .",
    "subsequently these parameters are evolved from this scale to @xmath62 using the four - loop @xmath63 function . in other words , we impose the renormalization group equation on the moments rather than on the correlator itself .",
    "this procedure is not only technically simpler but also avoids possible inconsistencies inherent to the usual approach where one applies the renormalization group to the correlator , expands in powers of @xmath64 and carries out the integration in the complex plane only at the end . in the present case",
    "the reference scale is given by @xmath65 .",

    "has to incorporate the charm contribution in addition to the contribution of the light quark flavours .",
    "further on when going beyond bottom quark threshold one has to include in addition the bottom contribution . finally , above top quark threshold",
    "the top contribution has to be added .",
    "let us begin by discussing the region between charm and bottom threshold @xmath74 .",
    "as concerns the polynomially weighted second integral in  ( [ eqn6 ] ) the charm contribution is obtained by the contour integration on the circle @xmath75 whereas the light quark contribution is now obtained from the difference of the contour integrations at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , i.e.  for the light quark contribution we now have @xmath77    in the region between charm and bottom quark threshold the weight function @xmath7 is reasonably smooth and can be well approximated by polynomial functions of low degrees .",
    "the quality of the polynomial approximations is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) for @xmath78 .",
    "as mentioned before we impose the condition @xmath79 at @xmath80 in order to suppress the charmonium contribution with no restriction at the upper end @xmath81 . in particular we do not set @xmath82 at @xmath83 since instanton effects are expected to be negligible at these energies .",
    "one obtains a very good polynomial approximation @xmath7 starting with @xmath84 as fig .",
    "2(a ) shows .    for the charm and bottom quark",
    "we use the qcd perturbative result in terms of an expansion in powers of @xmath85 to an even higher order than in the case of the strange quark .",
    "the current correlator is known up to three loops ( i.e.  @xmath86 ) up to order @xmath87  @xcite . for our purposes",
    "the @xmath88 accuracy is quite sufficient since we need not go beyond @xmath89 .",
    "for example , for @xmath81 the contribution of the @xmath90-order term in the charm mass expansion amounts to a tiny @xmath91 effect . on the other hand",
    "the availability of the high power expansion of  @xcite allows us to go to quite high degrees of the polynomial approximation .",
    "this reduces the influence of data on our results and further allows us to check on the consistency of our procedure by comparing results for different @xmath35 .",
    "we would like to briefly comment on the mass dependence of the perturbative charm contribution .",
    "while the lowest order result for the spectral density decreases when the charm mass is increased the addition of the higher order terms leads to an increase of the spectral density with increasing mass  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the result of integrating the polynomially weighted current correlator @xmath92 over the circle decreases with mass .",
    "this can again be understood from analyticity : when doing the equivalent integration over the polynomially weighted imaginary part of @xmath92 the range of integration becomes smaller as the mass increases and the threshold moves up .",
    "the bottom quark contribution has its threshold at @xmath93 .",
    "there is no natural choice for the upper radius @xmath94 . on the one hand one would like to choose @xmath94 high enough so that one can safely start using local duality to evaluate the remaining part of the dispersion integral  ( [ eqn2 ] ) from @xmath94 to infinity by replacing @xmath11 by its qcd counter part . on the other hand",
    "the interval between @xmath95 and @xmath94 should not become too large to degrade the quality of the polynomial approximation to the weight function @xmath7 .",
    "we strike a compromise between these two requirements and introduce two intervals of approximately equal spacing .",
    "the one interval extends from @xmath93 to @xmath96 and the second interval extends from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "the integrations in the two intervals are done as discussed before using contour integrals on circles or differences of these . in fig  3(a ) we show the quality of the polynomial fit for the interval @xmath98 .",
    "a similar quality is obtained for the interval @xmath99 but is not shown here .",
    "the remaining part of the dispersion integral  ( [ eqn2 ] ) starting from @xmath97 up to infinity is done using local duality , i.e.  we substitute perturbative qcd for @xmath11 in  ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "we begin the presentation of our results by discussing the light quark region in the interval from @xmath100 to @xmath101 . at present the condensate power corrections",
    "are only known up to order @xmath102 with any degree of confidence .",
    "therefore the maximal degree of the polynomial approximation is restricted to lie below @xmath103 in the light quark region . for polynomials of higher degree , by cauchy s theorem , unknown higher dimension condensates would contribute to the circular integration . in principle",
