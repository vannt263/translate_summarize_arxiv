    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is nowadays well tested within a plethora of low and high energy experiments .",
    "the recent discovery of a particle compatible with the missing fundamental scalar @xcite , @xcite , the higgs boson , establishes the last great success of the sm .",
    "of course the theoretical and experimental frontiers are just moved onto some further questions and issues . among those ,",
    "let us consider the so - called hierarchy problem or the question why the higgs boson mass is light after including loop corrections .",
    "indeed , the higgs mass receives quantum corrections from all heavy sm particles ( higgs , gauge bosons and top quark ) .",
    "such divergences are quadratic in a generic cutoff scale and not protected by any chiral symmetry like the fermion masses are",
    ". moreover , any possible new physics scale laying between the electroweak and the planck scale might push up the cutoff scale . unless a fine tuning is considered as a satisfactory answer",
    ", a deeper understanding is desirable .",
    "certainly several beyond the standard model scenarios have been considered in the literature .",
    "supersymmetry  @xcite , extra - dimensions  @xcite , partial compositeness  @xcite and compositeness  @xcite are just a few of them .",
    "an active search for supersymmetric particles has been carried out at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) with no positive outcome until now  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this brings to a quite narrow window for the minimal supersymmetric model even though many non - minimal realizations are still under investigation and not excluded by the current data .",
    "the compositeness approach is somewhat complementary to supersymmetry and no experimental evidence has been provided either .",
    "new unknown particles are supposed to be the constituents of the higgs boson and its mass is induced by some internal dynamics as a meson mass is generated by an interacting quark anti - quark pair @xcite . on the same footing , composite models also concern about the proliferation of the sm leptons and quarks collected in the three different generations .",
    "one of the main consequence of a further substructure is the possibility to observe excited fermions that would produce signatures to be studied at colliders @xcite . indeed",
    ", many experimental analysis at colliders have been performed about the direct or indirect search of excited fermions , especially in the framework of four - fermion contact interactions .",
    "the stronger bounds are nowadays provided by the lhc experiments @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on excited leptons and in particular on those having an exotic charge @xmath6 .",
    "these states appear in the context of phenomenological models that rely on isospin invariance and magnetic type interaction @xcite .",
    "doubly charged leptons appear also in string inspired models @xcite and in supersymmetric extensions of left - right symmetric models @xcite,@xcite .",
    "not prompt decaying doubly charged leptons have been also considered as a viable candidate for cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "the production cross section and relevant signatures for the excited doubly charged leptons have been studied in some detail for both the contact and gauge interactions in the lhc framework  @xcite . in this work , we address the phenomenology of doubly charged leptons in the context of the forthcoming electron - positron linear colliders .",
    "in particular , we aim to investigate the signatures produced by the doubly charged leptons at the linear colliders facilities and the interplay with the corresponding sm background . the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "@xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite proposals offer the possibility to have @xmath7 beams .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath7 scattering is its particular sensitivity to lepton violating processes , such as those that would be induced by the existence of heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on this particular beam option , besides the standard one ( @xmath8 ) , because it allows for the single production channel .",
    "indeed , at tree level , the @xmath8 configuration allows only pair production of the excited leptons and the available phase space would be very limited since the excited lepton mass is expected to be quite large .",
    "we consider a pure leptonic final state as follows : @xmath9 since we want to shape the main features of the process we fix the flavour of the final state leptons within the first generation ( electron flavour ) .",
    "we emphasise that the atlas and cms collaborations have recently provided lower bounds on the mass of the excited leptons and of long lived multi - charged particles .",
    "excited leptons have been searched in the process @xmath10 , assuming that the new particles are produced via contact interactions and decay via gauge interactions  @xcite .",
    "they provide a lower bound on the mass of the excited leptons @xmath11 tev for the special case in which the compositeness scale @xmath12 . when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are treated as independent parameters exclusion curves are given in the plane ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "for example for @xmath16 tev the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find @xmath17 tev .    as regards the long lived multi - charged particles the atlas collaboration excludes particles up to 430 gev based on the run at @xmath18 tev and with @xmath19 fb@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "similarly the cms collaboration sets lower mass limits up to 685 gev within the run at @xmath21 tev and with @xmath22 fb@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these exclusion limits do not directly apply to our model because drell - yan - like pair production is assumed for the multi - charged particle in the experimental analysis and the doubly charged lepton considered here promptly decays .",
    "the production of excited fermions at linear electron - positron and electron - proton colliders has been addressed already long ago @xcite,@xcite . a more recent phenomenological study on excited fermions at linear colliders",

    "we remark here that these results are based on a numerical computation which includes all 28 feynman diagrams contributing to the dominant standard model process generated by calchep , including all interferences .",
    "it turns out that the interferences are largely destructive and thus they make the sm background lower than it could be estimated by simply considering the dominant diagrams .",
    "we consider two different cases for the luminosity , @xmath158 fb@xmath20 and @xmath159 fb@xmath20 , and two energies of the colliding electrons , @xmath81 tev and @xmath100 tev .",
    "this choice possibly corresponds to the nominal luminosity @xmath160 fb@xmath20 ( @xmath161 fb@xmath20 ) and energy for the ilc @xcite ( and clic @xcite ) facilities .",
    "indeed it has been argued  @xcite that the luminosity of the @xmath67 collider should be @xmath162 of the @xmath163 configuration . accordingly",
    "[ fig : lumicurves ] shows the phase space regions accessible by the ilc and clic at 3- and 5-@xmath109 level with both values of the luminosity given above ( 125 fb@xmath20 and 250 fb@xmath20 ) . finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] the ilc and clic exclusion regions at 3-@xmath109 are compared with bounds provided by the lhc analyses of run i at @xmath164 tev  @xcite and with the prospected exclusion bound on the parameter space ( @xmath165 ) from a theoretical study of the three - lepton signature of the doubly charged excited electron at run ii lhc ( @xmath166 tev )  @xcite .",
    "for example , for a mass of @xmath167 tev the corresponding limit on the compositeness scale at ilc ( clic ) would be @xmath168 tev ( @xmath169 tev ) at 3-sigma level and for @xmath158 fb@xmath20 , instead of @xmath170 tev at the lhc ( run i )  @xcite .",
    "the situation appears to be even more encouraging at larger values of the excited lepton mass . for @xmath171 tev the expected clic exclusion bound on @xmath13 would be ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lumicurves ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) @xmath172 tev ( @xmath173 tev ) for l=125 fb@xmath20 ( l=250 fb@xmath20 ) , which is much better than the current ( run i ) lhc bound : @xmath174 tev  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "we note that the clic bound on @xmath13 for @xmath171 tev ( @xmath175-@xmath176 tev ) fares pretty well also with the predictions about the same model at run ii ( @xmath166 tev ) of lhc from ref .",
    "@xcite where for @xmath171 tev one expects , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath177 fb@xmath20 , the lower bound on the compositeness scale @xmath178 tev .",
    "we remark also that the actual bounds quoted from the current run i lhc analyses  @xcite refer to excited leptons of ordinary iso - spin doublets and strictly speaking do not apply to the exotic charge states of the extended iso - spin multiplets , object of this work . given the similarities of the interactions we do not expect the bounds from eventual dedicated search analyses of the exotic charge states to differ very much form those being currently considered .",
    "+ we conclude this section with an important remark . while we have not performed a simulation of the detector reconstruction efficiencies we expect our predictions for the contour plots of the statistical significance to be rather conservative . indeed from fig .",
    "[ fig : distrbk_1 ] we see that the signal electrons are more energetic than those of the background .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity distribution is quite central for the signal ( practically contained in the geometrical acceptance of the detector @xmath179 ) whereas it is more spread out for the background .",
    "while the background electrons out of the geometrical acceptance are lost those that are within the geometrical acceptance are in any case less energetic than the ones from the signal .",
    "these elements favour a higher reconstruction efficiency for the electrons of the signal than for those of the sm background leading thus to a higher statistical significance .",
    "we expect therefore that including such detector reconstruction efficiencies would increase the statistical significance and thus would enlarge the region of the parameter space that could be probed by the linear collider .",
    "overall we can say that while the ilc is obviously limited in the mass range by kinematics and could only fare better for lower masses only with higher luminosities than those considered here , the clic collider at @xmath180 tev is highly competitive with lhc run ii well within the region of high masses ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison ] right panel ) .",
    "in the paper we discuss the production of heavy exotic doubly charged leptons in the framework of forthcoming linear colliders .",
    "in particular we focus on the beam setting @xmath7 , that allows for the production of a single doubly charged lepton instead of the corresponding pair production .",
    "since the excited doubly charged lepton mass is expected to be heavy , the @xmath95 beam configuration determines a wider mass parameter space to explore with respect to the @xmath8 beam setting .",
    "we consider the production of the heavy exotic lepton both within contact and gauge interactions . in the latter case we study in some detail the production cross section in relation with the different isospin multiplets ( @xmath35 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "in particular , we take into account the interference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels and we provide the expression for the differential cross sections .",
    "the interference effect has not been previously evaluated and it is there for @xmath181 . despite the production via contact interaction mechanism dominates over the gauge interaction one , the additional @xmath0-@xmath1 interference term produces a sizable contribution to the cross section in the gauge mediated case .",
    "it amounts to a reduction of the production cross section by a factor of one third at @xmath81 tev .    by considering the decay cascade @xmath182 , the following final state particle set",
    "is studied : @xmath183 .",
    "experimentally it translates into a lsd pair and missing transverse energy .",
    "we study the lsd invariant mass distribution to assess the detection strategy of the signal in the linear collider and @xmath95 beam setting .",
    "while we do not take into account other new physics sources besides the excited doubly charged lepton , we study in detail the relevant sm background ( 28 feynman diagrams and relative interferences ) .",
    "we perform an analysis of their kinematic distributions by means of calchep including in the final simulations isr and beamstrahlung effects both for the signal and the sm backgorund .",
    "we then suggest a sample of kinematic cuts to discard background events whereas keeping the signal strength still high .",
    "we derive by means of calchep the number of expected signal and background events taking into account some improved cuts .",
    "therefore , we provide the 3 and 5-sigma statistical significance exclusion curves in the @xmath69 parameter space .    calchep allows to study kinematic distributions for particles which are ideally reconstructed . in order to better establish the possibility to observe such exotic leptons at liner colliders",
    ", it would be desirable to introduce the effects of detectors like the efficiency reconstruction of the physical objects .",
    "however this effect , if taken properly into account , will work in favor of the signal over background event ratio , and so the statistical significance is expected to increase , in view of the fact that hard and central electrons , which are expected to be more frequent in the signal than in the sm background , are more easily reconstructed in a general purpose detector .",
    "therefore we expect that a detector simulation of the reconstruction efficiencies at the linear collider is bound to improve the region of the parameter space that can be probed at 3 and 5-sigma level relative to the current results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumicurves ] .",
    "we emphasize however that in the present study we have taken in to account basic detector effects like the geometrical acceptance ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we can say that based on the result presented here further investigations of the present model at linear colliders are strongly encouraged perhaps investigating possible effects due to the available polarisation of the beams that could still improve the bounds of fig .",
    "[ fig : lumicurves ] . also , at a linear collider it may still prove interesting to investigate interference effects of the exotic doubly charged lepton exchanged as a virtual particle .",
    "for instance in @xmath184 , as opposed to the direct production .",
    "if there will be no direct observation of contact interactions and/or excited fermions at the lhc run ii in the region of large excited lepton masses , @xmath185 tev , the clic lower bounds @xmath186-@xmath176 tev , on the basis of expectations of signatures of the same model at the lhc @xmath166 tev  @xcite , remains highly competitive with the bound expected for run ii of the lhc : @xmath178 tev ( see fig .",
