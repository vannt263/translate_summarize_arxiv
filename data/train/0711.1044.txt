    "the classical paradigm is that at given total mass of the system a galactic disk is stabilized against local dynamical jeans instabilities , if it is embedded in a dark halo .",
    "this can be seen for instance from toomre s @xmath0 stability index for a stellar disk , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the epicyclic frequency of the orbits of the stars , @xmath3 is the radial velocity dispersion of the stars , and @xmath4 the surface density of the disk .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the constant of gravitation .",
    "if all other parameters are kept constant , but @xmath4 is lowered , @xmath0 rises and the disk becomes more stable against jeans instabilities .",
    "the physical reasoning is that the self - gravity of the disk , which has a destabilizing effect , is reduced by the surrounding halo .",
    "similarly the onset of non - axisymmetric coherent large - scale instabilities of the entire disk such as the bar instability was thought to be damped by a surrounding halo .",
    "ostriker & peebles @xcite showed in their classical numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of a self - gravitating disk that the bar instability could be suppressed , if the disk was embedded in a halo potential .",
    "however , modern high - resolution simulations in which the surrounding halo is treated as a dynamically responsive system , have shown that actually the opposite is true .",
    "athanassoula @xcite showed that in her simulations of the bar instability the bar grows stronger , if the disk is embedded in a live dark halo rather than in a static halo potential .",
    "this was explained there and , particularly , in athanassoula @xcite as due to the effect of the live halo on the angular momentum exchange within the galaxy .",
    "first doubts about an entirely passive role of the halo were already raised by toomre@xcite .",
    "these findings were supported by theoretical studies of the swing amplification of shearing spiral density waves which is also enhanced , if the disk is embedded in a live dark halo instead of a static potential ( fuchs@xcite , fuchs & athanassoula @xcite ) .    here",
    "we return to the severe local jeans instability of a self - gravitating disk and investigate the effect of the presence of a live dark halo . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate how toomre s concept of the @xmath0 parameter can be generalized in order to take into account the effect of such a halo . in the final section",
    "we discuss implications for realistic disk - halo systems ( cf .",
    "also esquivel & fuchs @xcite ) .",
    "we study the jeans instability of an infinitesimally thin galactic disk using the model of a patch of the galactic disk developed by toomre@xcite , goldreich & lynden - bell@xcite , and julian & toomre @xcite ( cf .",
    "also fuchs @xcite ) .",
    "the patch is assumed to rotate around the galactic center and the differential rotation of the stars is approximated as a linear shear flow .",
    "the surface density is assumed to be constant over the patch .",
    "polar coordinates are approximated by pseudo cartesian coordinates @xmath6 with @xmath7 pointing in the radial direction and @xmath8 in the direction of rotation , respectively .",
    "toomre @xcite ( cf .  also lin @xcite ) has calculated the dynamical response of the disk to a small ` ring - like ' perturbation of the gravitational disk potential of the form @xmath9 by solving the linearized boltzmann equation which describes the evolution of the phase space distribution of the disk stars .",
    "the induced density perturbation can be expressed as @xmath10   \\phi_{\\rm k }   { \\rm e}^{i(\\omega t+kx ) } \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath11 denote modified bessel functions and @xmath4 the background surface density of the disk , respectively . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq2b ] ) a schwarzschild velocity distribution of the stars with the radial velocity dispersion @xmath3 has been adopted .",
    "the disk is assumed to be self - gravitating , so that the density  potential pair has to fulfill the poisson equation implying @xmath12 equations ( [ eq2b ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) can be combined to a dispersion relation @xmath13 for the ` ring'-like perturbations of the disk . in the limit",
    "@xmath14 eq .  ( [ eq2b ] ) reduces to @xmath15   \\phi_{\\rm k } e^{ikx } .",

    "( [ eq2b ] ) , separates neutrally stable ( @xmath18 ) from exponentially unstable ( @xmath19 ) perturbations .",
    "the criterion that ensures that all perturbations are neutrally stable is the famous toomre criterion @xmath20    the model of a local patch of a galactic disk has been extended by fuchs @xcite by embedding it into a dark halo .",
    "all density gradients in the halo are neglected as in the disk so that the halo density distribution is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "the dark matter particles follow straight - line orbits with an isotropic velocity distribution modelled by a gaussian distribution .",
    "we can directly apply the results of fuchs@xcite .",
    "as is shown there the dark matter halo responds to the potential perturbation @xmath21 in the disk and develops potential perturbations @xmath22 which have the same radial structure exp(@xmath23 ) as in the disk .",
    "equations ( 26 ) and ( 28 ) of fuchs @xcite have been obtained as solutions of the linearized boltzmann equation for the dark matter particles and give the fourier coefficients of the potential perturbation in the halo at the midplane of the disk . in the case @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which we consider here , there is only a contribution from non - resonant dark matter particles , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the density of the dark halo and the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles , respectively .",
    "this induced perturbation of the gravitational potential of the dark halo has to be taken into account on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath30 which means that the halo supports the perturbation of the disk and the density perturbation in the disk is stronger than in an isolated disk . combining eqns .",

    "the unstable perturbations ( @xmath19 ) are located in the parameter space below the line .",
    "thus for @xmath37 all perturbations are neutrally stable ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is no longer the case , if finite values of @xmath35 are considered .",

    "all perturbations of the disk  halo system become unstable and grow exponentially .",
    "this behaviour is related to the jeans collapse of the halo component .",
    "its jeans length is given by @xmath41 or @xmath42 in real haloes the jeans length will be of the order of the size of the halo or even larger , because otherwise the haloes would have collapsed to smaller sizes .",
    "thus the inferred instability of the disk  halo system on large scales seems not to occur in real galaxies . as can be seen from fig",
    ".  1 stability on small scales can be ensured by @xmath0 indices at thresholds which are slightly larger than in isolated disks .",
    "as a first application of the stability criterion derived here we test the stability of the milky way disk and the surrounding dark halo in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "the local disk and halo parameters listed in table [ table1 ] imply @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . if we include in our estimate the cold interstellar gas with a local surface density of @xmath45/pc@xmath46 ( dame @xcite ) and assume a velocity dispersion of the interstellar gas of @xmath47 = 5 km / s , which leads to a reduced mass weighted effective velocity dispersion of the combined stellar and gaseous disks , the parameter values change to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . equation ( [ eq7 ] ) implies that @xmath50 = 39 kpc .",
    "since the instability sets in nominally at @xmath51 the milky way disk and halo system seems to be very stable .",
    "[ table1 ]    in order to explore in what range the @xmath35-parameter of spiral galaxies is to be expected in general , we consider the model of a mestel disk with the surface density @xmath52 embedded in a singular isothermal sphere representing the dark halo with the density distribution @xmath53 .",
    "the rotation curve of the model galaxy is given by @xmath54 with the disk contribution @xmath55 = const .  and",
    "the halo contribution @xmath56 = const .",
    "( binney & tremaine @xcite ) .",
    "assuming isotropic velocity dispersions of the dark matter particles it follows from the radial jeans equation , @xmath57 that their velocity dispersion is given by @xmath58 because the dark matter particles are bound by both the gravitational disk and halo potentials .",
    "we find then @xmath59 which implies the maximal value",
    "@xmath60 this means that in realistic halo models its density can not be increased , on one hand , and the velocity dispersion of the halo particles lowered , on the other hand , indiscriminately because the halo has to stay in radial hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "equation ( [ eq11 ] ) implies @xmath61 , whereas the instability sets nominally in at @xmath62 . in order to ensure stability at smaller wave lengths",
    "the toomre stability index must be larger than @xmath63 .    as a further concrete example we analyse the dynamics of the low surface brightness galaxy f568 - 1 .",
    "de blok et al .",
    "@xcite have observed its rotation curve and constructed several concurring mass models for the galaxy , which all fit the rotation curve equally well .",
    "using the parameters of the models with isothermal haloes and with either a ` realistic ' @xmath64-ratio of the disk or a ` maximum - disk ' we have solved numerically the radial jeans equation ( [ eq8a ] ) for the dark matter particles , @xmath65 the resulting @xmath35-parameters of both models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the @xmath35-parameters are of the same small order of magnitude as in the milky way or the simple disk  halo model described above .",
    "we conclude from this discussion that embedded galactic disks are not prone to jeans instabilities , provided their toomre stability index is a few percent higher than @xmath0 = 1 . from a practical point of view",
    "the destabilizing effect of the surrounding dark halo on the jeans instability of the embedded galactic disks seems to be negligible .",
