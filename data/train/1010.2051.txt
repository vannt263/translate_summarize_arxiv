    "the lorentz - invariant single - particle inclusive cross section has the form f(ab )  e  =  e where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energy , longitudinal and transverse momentum of the outgoing particle c with respect to the incoming proton direction ; and @xmath8 is the lorentz - invariant phase space  =  d^4p  ( p^2-m^2 )  ( e ) , where @xmath9 is the mass of particle c. for high - energy hadronic collisions , experiment shows that the longitudinal momentum may take almost any value , whereas the transverse momentum is usually small .",
    "the rapidity @xmath4 is a convenient way to display the @xmath10 dependence of the data , where y  =   ( )  =  log ( ) , where @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends on the reference frame , and , at first sight , it looks like a rather ungainly construct . however , there are advantages to present high energy data as a function of rapidity .",
    "first , we see @xmath12 , and so the lorentz - invariant cross section f(ab )  =  .",
    "second , rapidity is additive under lorentz boosts along the beam direction .",
    "for example , under a boost of velocity @xmath13 e ( e+up_l ) ,  p_l ( p_l+ue ) , where @xmath14 . hence y",
    "y  +  ( )  =  y+y_boost .",
    "thus the difference in rapidity of two particles is not changed by boosts along the beam axis . in the non - relativistic limit , when the boost @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 and thus the rapidity @xmath17 velocity @xmath18 ( hence its name ) .    for a massless particle @xmath19 .",
    "then the rapidity can be directly expressed in terms of the scattering angle @xmath20 y  =  ( )  =  -log  tan . in general",
    ", we define pseudorapidity as  =  -log  tan .",
    "clearly , for massless particles the rapidity and pseudorapidity are the same .",
    "however , this is also the case for particles with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we now come to the single - particle rapidity distributions measured at the lhc . from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", both the phase space of particle c and the matrix element should be written in terms of covariant variables , that is in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath7 . long ago , regge theory predicted a flat rapidity distribution in the central region .",
    "indeed , in regge theory it assumed that @xmath7 is limited and @xmath23 does not increase with energy . at very high energies ,",
    "the inclusive cross section is described by the emission of secondaries from the pomeron .",
    "the probability of the emission of particle c is given by the effective pomeron - c vertex , @xmath24 , which does not depend on rapidity @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : a1 ] .",
    "we have  =  _ n^2  _",
    "pc(p_t )  s_ac^(0)-1  s_bc^(0)-1 . if @xmath4 is measured in the @xmath25 centre - of - mass frame , then s_ac , bc  =  m_p  m_t   exp(y+y/2 ) ( where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the intercept of the pomeron trajectory ) , and the independence of the distribution on @xmath4 is explicit .",
    "the cross section may also be written in terms of parton distributions  =  dx_1 dx_2   g(x_1 ) g(x_2 )  ( y- ) , [ eq : parton ] with @xmath28 . if the gluon distributions can be described by a fixed power , @xmath29 , then again we see that the single - particle multiplicity distribution is expected to be flat in @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the present monte carlos are based on ( [ eq : parton ] ) , and yield a flat distribution in the central region , see fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] .",
    "the pythia 6.4 monte carlo ( atlas ) @xcite was used to demonstrate the effects in figs .",

    "the single - particle distributions so far measured at the lhc have limited particle identification . the three - momentum of the particle is measured , but not , in general , its mass . without knowledge of @xmath9",
    "it is not possible to calculate @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the results are presented in terms of the pseudorapidity @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath31 we need @xmath21 . however , for low @xmath7 the equality does not hold .",
    "in particular , a particle with low @xmath7 may have small @xmath4 , but rather large @xmath5 , since for low @xmath7 this slow particle tends to be emitted at a small polar angle @xmath20 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider @xmath22 .",
    "then the difference -y  =  log  +  o ( ) . the log may be quite large as @xmath32 .",
    "the most interesting region , @xmath33 , in the multiplicity distributions measured at the collider , contains a singularity , the jacobian between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 bins is @xmath36 . for low @xmath7 , it has a singularity at @xmath37 .",
    "] at @xmath38 . as a consequence",
    "the low @xmath7 particles are spread over a larger @xmath5 region , depopulating the @xmath33 region .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3 ] as a dip in the @xmath5 distribution for @xmath33 . for distributions corresponding to larger values of @xmath7",
    "the dip is less pronounced .",
    "-pseudorapidity correlation obtained from the same monte carlo sample as fig  [ fig : a2].,height=302 ]    this trivial kinematic effect produces some @xmath5 dependence of @xmath23 measured in the central detector . since low @xmath7 particles are spread over a larger number of low @xmath5 bins , the measured value of @xmath23 decreases with increasing @xmath39 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : a4 ] .",
    "this effect is not present in the @xmath4 distributions .     as a function of pseudorapidity ( upper points ) and rapidity ( lower points).,height=302 ]    .",
    "although the pions dominate , there are a appreciable number of soft electrons in the very lowest @xmath7 bins and a significant kaon and baryon component at the larger @xmath7 values.,height=302 ]    of course , the majority of secondaries are pions . therefore the multiplicity distributions may be presented in terms of @xmath4 by assigning all particles to be pions .",
    "nevertheless there are two sources of potential difficulty .",
    "first look at fig .",
    "[ fig : a5 ] .",
    "it shows the fractions of different sorts of secondaries according to a pythia monte carlo simulation .",
    "first , we see the presence of electrons ( arising from dalitz pairs ) in the very lowest @xmath7 bins .",
    "if the electron is assigned the mass of the pion , then its ` effective ' rapidity becomes close to zero , which produces a prominant erroneous peak for @xmath40 .",
    "second , at larger @xmath7 , the kaons and baryons , which are misassigned as pions , lead to an erroneous dip for @xmath40 .",
    "this dip disappears as we go to larger values of @xmath7 .",
    "note however , that to neglect the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we need a value of @xmath7 larger than the mass of the corresponding hadron .",
    "all these effects are seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : a6 ] and [ fig : a7 ] .",
    "note , from fig .",
    "[ fig : a5 ] , that in the larger @xmath7 region , the fraction of kaons and baryons is appreciable . only about 60@xmath41 of secondaries are pions .",
    "recall also that the region of low @xmath7 and small @xmath5 is very poorly described by the present monte carlo models .",
    "we should therefore take care when discussing this domain .",
    "-rapidity correlation assuming that all the particles of fig .",
    "[ fig : a5 ] have the mass of the pion . , height=302 ]    , but omitting the pion component and taking the other particles to have the mass of the pion.,height=302 ]",
    "to demonstrate the importance of using the correct rapidity variable , we consider the coherence effects in low @xmath7 particle production . in the regge approach ,",
    "the @xmath7 distribution of secondaries produced in the central region ( @xmath42 ) does not depend on energy , but reflects only the internal @xmath7-structure of the pomeron .",
    "therefore we expect that the particle density @xmath43 measured at low @xmath7 will increase with energy just like the density @xmath44 integrated over gives a small contribution . ] over @xmath7 .",
    "that is , by about 60% in going from the collider energy of 0.9 to 7 tev . in terms of monte carlo models",
    "such an effect is simulated by the number of multiple interactions ( mi ) , which increases with initial energy of the colliding protons .",
    "on the other hand , such an approach does not account for the coherence effects which may be quite important for low momenta secondaries . for low @xmath7 particles ,",
    "interference arises when a particle is radiated from different lines of feynman diagrams which make up the whole matrix element .",
    "one example of this is soft gluon emission .",
    "another example is the hanbury - brown@xmath30twiss effect , where two identical particles can be radiated from different places in the interaction region .",
    "their interference leads to a peak in the distribution of the two identical particles when their momenta are close to each other .",
    "the width of the peak can be used to estimate the size of the interaction region @xcite .",
    "first we discuss soft gluon emission , which leads to the so - called limiting energy behaviour .",
    "the radiation of soft gluons from several quarks and/or gluons develops in a coherent way .",
    "the reason is that different sources of secondaries should act as a single source with an effective colour ` charge ' equal to the ` _ vector _ ' sum of all the colour ` charges ' , as a gluon of large wavelength can not resolve these smaller details . recall that , due to the lorentz time dilation , the low momentum hadrons are formed at the initial stage , before the fast particles @xcite .",
    "these fast particles , which are formed later on , fly out of the interaction region and leave the slow hadrons intact .",
    "such a limiting behaviour of soft secondaries was first predicted , and observed , in @xmath45 annihilation @xcite , and then extended to the @xmath25 case @xcite .",
    "also , note that , if the incoming hadron represents a quark - antiquark ( meson ) or quark - diquark ( nucleon ) system , then the @xmath46-channel multi - gluon exchange corresponds dominantely to a colour octet .",
    "the same colour - octet exchange dominates the bfkl amplitude .",
    "so even in the case of a large number of gluon exchanges ( or a large number of mi ) , the low @xmath7 secondaries will be produced mainly via radiation caused by colour - octet flow .",
    "thus , in the ideal case , we may expect a limiting energy behaviour of the soft particle density .",
    "that is , at very low @xmath7 , the value of @xmath47 should not depend ( or depend only weakly ) on the initial energy , see ref .",
    "however , as was shown above , in order to measure the density of low-@xmath7 particles at small @xmath4 , it is important to use the correct ` rapidity ' variable , and not just the angle ( that is , @xmath5 ) . otherwise the expected ` limiting ' behaviour may be affected by an admixture of other sorts of particles , some lighter and some heavier than the pion .",
    "the hanbury - brown@xmath30twiss correlation can be viewed as the first step in the formation of condensates of bosons which arise from bose - einstein statistics . at high energies when the particle density increases , and",
    "the number of particles exceeds one in the elementary @xmath48 cells of some domain of configuration space , there may be two sorts of such collective phenomena .",
    "one is of pure classical , thermodynamic origin , like elliptic flow in quark - gluon plasma .",
    "another one is based on quantum mechanical interference .",
    "we consider the formation of some multiparticle coherent state ( such as in superconductivity or in a disorientated chiral condensate @xcite ) .",
    "the coherent emission of soft gluons by the vector sum of the whole colour charge may be considered as the first signature of the multiparticle coherent state .",
    "since the wavelength of low @xmath7 particles is large , it is expected that such collective phenomena will occur , and be best observed , in the low @xmath7 region . in comparison with lower energies , these collective",
    ", coherent effects should be enhanced at the lhc due to the larger density of low @xmath7 secondaries .    in summary , to observe such phenomena we need a careful study of very soft particle distributions using the correct lorentz covariant variables .",
