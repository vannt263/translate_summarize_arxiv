    "the numerical semigroup gap counting problem  @xcite has been actively researched from the mathematical point of view since 19th century ; e.g. , sylvester  @xcite .",
    "we denote this problem by @xmath2 .",
    "this problem is defined as follows .",
    "given a set @xmath3 of coprime positive integers @xmath4 , the task is counting the number of all integers that can not be represented as nonnegative integer combinations of @xmath3 .",
    "then , the set of all integers represented as nonnegative integer combinations of @xmath3 is a semigroup called a _ numerical semigroup _  @xcite and denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , an integer not in @xmath5 is called a _ gap _ of the numerical semigroup @xmath5 and the set of all gaps of @xmath5",
    "is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "an integer in @xmath5 is called a _ nongap _ of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 are given , then @xmath6 consists of @xmath8 integers @xmath9 . for a given set @xmath3 of coprime positive integers",
    ", it is known that @xmath6 is finite  @xcite .",
    "moreover , an element of @xmath6 is called a gap of the numerical semigroup .",
    "moreover , we call the maximum integer of @xmath6 the _ frobenius number _ and denote it by @xmath10 .      in this paper , we assume the reader to be familiar with basic notions and results on computational complexity theory .",
    "the reader is referred to textbooks ; e.g. , arora and barak  @xcite , du and ko  @xcite , papadimitriou  @xcite .",
    "we denote the class of all deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial - time computable decision problems by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we denote the class of all polynomial - time computable function problems by @xmath13 .    in researches for the problem @xmath2 , there are two standpoints on whether we assume the number @xmath14 of given coprime positive integers @xmath4 to be a parameter of the input .",
    "generally , @xmath14 is assumed to be variable unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "this paper follows this convention .",
    "more precisely , we consider the sum of the bit lengths of given integers and the number of the given integers to be the parameters of the input of @xmath2 in this paper .",
    "little research has been known from the complexity theoretical point of view for the problem @xmath2 although many results have been known from other viewpoints .",
    "ramrez - alfonsn  ( problem a.4.2 in @xcite ) proposed the following question .",
    "_ `` is computing @xmath15 @xmath16-complete ? '' _ ( in @xcite , ramrez - alfonsn uses the notation @xmath6 for describing two different concepts ; the set of all gaps of @xmath5 and its cardinality , where @xmath3 is a finite set of coprime positive integers . from the context , it is clear to denote the latter in the above question . )",
    "this problem has remained open until the present work and we give an answer from the negative side .",
    "@xmath1 is one of the best - known classes of counting problems  @xcite and the counting counterpart of @xmath12 .",
    "we formally review the class @xmath1 formally in .",
    "although there is little result for @xmath2 from the complexity theoretical point of view , many results have been known on computation of @xmath2 .",
    "sylvester@xcite showed @xmath17 to be @xmath18 for two coprime positive integers @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "section 5 in  @xcite surveys results on equalities and inequalities for @xmath2 .",
    "barvinok and woods  @xcite found a polynomial - time algorithm for counting the number of elements in @xmath6 under the assumption that the number @xmath21 is fixed . in more detail , they found a short rational function for a generating function that counts all the elements of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "however , this algorithm is doubly exponential in the cardinality @xmath14 of @xmath3 .      this paper concerns counting all elements of @xmath6 for a given set @xmath3 of coprime positive integers .",
    "this problem is closely related to the problem finding the maximum element of @xmath6 , the frobenius number @xmath10 , for a given set @xmath3 of coprime positive integers .",
    "this problem has been studied as actively as on @xmath2 .",
    "we call this decision problem the _ frobenius problem _ and denote it by @xmath22 although the problem is called by several different names ; the linear diophantine problem of frobenius , the coin exchange problem of frobenius , and so on . in @xmath22 , we also assume the number @xmath14 of given positive integers to be a parameter of the input unless we explicitly state otherwise .",
    "ramrez - alfonsn  @xcite proved the frobenius problem to be @xmath12-hard under cook reductions .",
    "more recently , matsubara  @xcite proved the @xmath23-completeness of the frobenius problem under karp reductions .",
    "we formally review the class @xmath23 in .",
    "these results suggests that the problem @xmath2 is not as easy as @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , kannan  @xcite found a polynomial - time algorithm for solving the frobenius problem under the assumption that the number of input coprime positive integers is fixed .",
    "barvinok and woods  @xcite also found a polynomial - time algorithm under the same assumption .",
    "many experimentally fast algorithms have been developed for solving the frobenius problem ; e.g. , @xcite , section 1 in @xcite .",
    "more recently , roune  @xcite reported computations of the frobenius numbers for sets of coprime positive integers of large size , each of which is thousands of digits on the bit length and is up to @xmath24 on the number of coprime positive integers .      in this paper",
    ", we investigate the computational complexities of @xmath2 and its variants .",
    "in particular , we will prove those counting problems to be complete problems in a computational complexity class @xmath0 under two types of polynomial - time reductions , called parsimonious and relaxed subtractive reductions .",
    "the class @xmath0 is wider than @xmath1 .",
    "a relaxed subtractive reduction is a new type of reduction introducing in this paper .",
    "we describe more details of existing researches on related classes and some types of polynomial - time reductions below .",
    "meyer and stockmeyer  @xcite found a hierarchy of decision problems , called the polynomial - time hierarchy and many results have been known on this hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "we review this hierarchy formally in . roughly speaking ,",
    "the @xmath25st level of this hierarchy is the class @xmath12 and the class of every higher level of the hierarchy is considered to be a generalization of the class @xmath12 by a relativization .",
    "this hierarchy is known to be contained by @xmath26 , the class of all polynomial space computable decision problems .",
    "valiant  @xcite introduced the class @xmath27 and developed the theory of the computational complexities of counting problems .",
    "many complete problems are known for @xmath1  @xcite . in more detail , for a problem @xmath28 in @xmath12",
    ", we verify the correctness of a witness for an instance of @xmath28 and for the problem @xmath29 in @xmath1 , we count the number of such witnesses for @xmath28 .",
    "although @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath12 , @xmath1 has an interesting aspect , so called _ `` easy to decide but hard to count''_. there is a decision problem @xmath28 in @xmath11 such that the problem for counting the witnesses of a given instance of @xmath28 is @xmath1-complete .",
    "for example , the permanent problem@xcite is @xmath1-complete while its decision counterpart is the bipartite perfect matching problem , which is in @xmath11 .",
    "the descriptive power of @xmath1 is known to be so strong .",
    "toda proved the polynomial hierarchy to be randomized polynomial - time reducible to @xmath1  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "not a few counting problems appear to be not in @xmath1 and the classes wider than @xmath1 have been investigated .",
    "several types of counting complexity classes were introduced . in this paper , we use classes in the following two types of hierarchies @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite , which are counting variants of the polynomial hierarchy . as the complement of the latter hierarchy",
    ", we also use @xmath32 .",
    "we formally define these classes in .    a counting problem @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , is a representative of counting problems in a class wider than @xmath1 , which is a counting variant of the @xmath35-alternating quantified satisfiability problem .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is shown to be @xmath36-complete , for @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the classes of the counting version of the polynomial hierarchy are sensitive for which reduction we adopt .",
    "a parsimonious reduction is a polynomial - time reduction such that there is one - to - one correspondence between all witnesses of any instance of the problem that is reduced from and all witnesses of the constructed instance of the problem that is reduced to .",
    "informally speaking , parsimonious reductions are weaker reductions for counting problems . if two counting problems have similar structures , then we can find a parsimonious reduction .",
    "conversely , if we can construct a parsimonious reduction for two problems , then we have sufficiently grasped the structures of the two problems .",
    "we can observe this phenomenon from several counting problems in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to find a parsimonious reduction for given problems in many cases .",
    "on the other hand , general polynomial - time turing reductions are too strong to reduce counting problems in the following sense .",
    "toda and watanabe  @xcite shows that the hierarchy @xmath31 is not closed under cook reductions even if we restrict the number of its oracle calls to at most once .",
    "durand , hermann , and kolaitis  @xcite introduced subtractive reductions and found some complete counting problems in some classes in @xmath38 under subtractive reductions .",
    "subtractive reductions have powers stronger than parsimonious reductions but weaker than cook reductions .",
    "toda  @xcite proved that @xmath39 .",
    "we will use this result for proving that @xmath38 is closed under relaxed subtractive reductions in .",
    "schaefer  @xcite found a dichotomy theorem for the general satisfiability problems ; i.e. , we can classify all general satisfiability problems into one of @xmath11 and @xmath12-complete problems by properties defined in  @xcite .",

    "moreover , bauland , bhler , creignou , reith , schnoor , and vollmer  @xcite found a trichotomy for the class of counting problems , which is a generalization of the dichotomy theorem in  @xcite to the hierarchy @xmath40 .",
    "they introduced another type of reduction called a complementive reduction and showed the trichotomy classifying the @xmath41-alternating quantified satisfiability counting problems into three classes ; @xmath13 , @xmath1-complete under cook reductions , and @xmath36-complete under complementive reductions for some @xmath34 .",
    "note that , as described by the authors of  @xcite , _ `` the @xmath36-completeness under complementive reductions '' _ does not satisfy a more desirable condition for the completeness  ( section 2.2 in @xcite ) ; more precisely , @xmath36 is not closed under complementive reductions . on the other hand,@xmath38 is closed under complementive reductions .",
    "hermann and pichler  @xcite proved some counting problems on propositional abduction to be complete problems in some classes in the counting complexity classes in the counting hierarchies that we use in this paper .",
