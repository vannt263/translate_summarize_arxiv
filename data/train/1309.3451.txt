    "recently three - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) with magnetically ordered surface states had attracted much attention , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally.@xcite the topological surface states , usually gapless and featuring a low - energy dirac dispersion protected by time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry , generally become gapped when a ferromagnetically ordered layered material is grown over it . in this case",
    "the tr symmetry is broken by the proximity effect to the magnetic material .",
    "interesting effects on the magnetization dynamics arise when the topological surface becomes ferromagnetic.@xcite quantum fluctuations of the surface dirac fermions induce an additional berry phase , which modifies the landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation for the magnetization dynamics.@xcite furthermore , when an electric field is present , either external or originating from coulomb interactions , a topological magnetoelectric torque also appears in the ll equation.@xcite actually both effects arise from an induced chern - simons ( cs ) term @xcite upon integrating out the dirac fermions.@xcite    it is important to notice that most of the theoretical calculations in tis were performed so far only at zero temperature , although some aspects like the shift of the curie temperature in the ferromagnetic insulator / ti heterostructure were discussed.@xcite the disregard of the temperature effects till now is partially connected to the fact that finite temperature is not expected to modify the topological contribution to the effective electromagnetic lagrangian of a ti in the bulk,@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath6 is the so - called axion field @xcite .",
    "while both the dielectric constant , @xmath7 , and magnetic permeability , @xmath8 , receive finite temperature corrections , @xmath6 remains temperature - independent.@xcite this somewhat confirms the naive expectation for the term being topological in origin .",
    "this , however , is not the full story .",
    "for example , differently from the chiral anomaly leading to the axion term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l - em - ti ] ) , the parity anomaly in @xmath9 dimensions does indeed receive finite temperature corrections.@xcite therefore , integrating out the dirac fermions in 2 + 1 dimensions and at finite temperature generates additional temperature - dependent cs term .",
    "another important finite temperature aspect relates to the electromagnetic response and the many - body screening of the coulomb interaction . in graphene , where the chemical potential is typically zero",
    ", there is no screening of the long - range coulomb interaction at zero temperature , although a renormalization of the dielectric constant occurs.@xcite however , at finite temperature a thermal screening should occur , corresponding to a situation reminiscent of massless qed in @xmath10 dimensions.@xcite moreover , in contrast to graphene , most three - dimensional tis feature surface dirac fermions at a non - vanishing chemical potential , and we may expect that the screening in tis @xcite and in doped graphene @xcite at zero temperature behaves differently .    in recent experiments @xcite thin films of eus / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 heterostructure were grown , and it has been shown that the topological surface becomes ferromagnetic due to a proximity - induced symmetry breaking mechanism . the experiments also confirmed the theoretical expectations that the surface dirac fermions become gapped.@xcite many measurements in such a heterostructure are made at temperatures close to the curie temperature . therefore , it is of paramount importance to study theoretically quantum field theory models of dirac fermions at finite temperature and chemical potential . as we have mentioned above ,",
    "there are finite temperature corrections to the generated cs term .",
    "furthermore , since the cs term provides a correction to the berry phase of the proximity - induced ferromagnetism,@xcite the precessional behavior of the magnetization will be modified at finite temperature and in turn affect the spin - wave excitations .",
    "a finite chemical potential influences the physics on the surface dramatically even at zero temperature .",
    "for example , it is known that when the chemical potential is larger than the gap , the hall conductivity is not quantized any longer and is given by @xcite @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath12 represents the zero temperature gap .",
    "this suggests that in such a metallic regime the hall conductivity can not always be identified with the coefficient of a _ local _ fluctuation - generated cs term , i.e. , the topological mass which is induced by quantum fluctuations rather than by an external response . since the relevant situation for the magnetization dynamics is when the chemical potential is inside the gap , it is important to ask whether the hall conductivity remains quantized in this case when the temperature is finite . in this paper",
    "we will derive an analytical expression for hall conductivity at finite temperature and chemical potential in precisely this regime .",
    "we will show that a plateau persists at finite temperature when the chemical potential is inside the gap .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and discuss some simple thermally induced screening effects following from the vacuum polarization on the ti surface . in section",
    "iii we derive the low - energy cs term at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we discuss the physical consequences of this result for the magnetization dynamics in section iv , and in section v we summarize the main results .",
    "our starting point is the following hamiltonian for the surface dirac fermions , @xmath13 , where @xmath14^t$ ] .",
    "the @xmath15 matrix @xmath16 reads , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a scalar potential including contributions both from external electric field and coulomb interaction , and the magnetization @xmath19 satisfies the constraint @xmath20 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath21 can be after a rescaling @xmath22 conveniently written in qed - like form,@xcite @xmath23 in the above equation the dirac slash notation is used , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the vector field @xmath30 .    in order to study thermal effects on the magnetization dynamics and the screening of the coulomb interaction , we will perform the calculations in the imaginary time formalism , setting as usual @xmath31 with @xmath32 $ ] , and integrating out the fermions with anti - periodic boundary conditions , @xmath33 . thus , the amplitude @xmath34 appearing in the functional integral becomes @xmath35 in the imaginary time formalism , with the lagrangian in euclidean spacetime given by , @xmath36 where now the dirac slash features the euclidean dirac matrices @xmath37 and a chemical potential @xmath3 was included ( note that @xmath38 ) . integrating out the fermions yields the effective action in the form , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of dirac fermion species and @xmath42 is the ( infinite ) volume .",

    "the calculation of the vacuum polarization in @xmath10 dimensions and zero temperature is well known @xcite and has been reviewed by us in detail recently in ref . .",
    "due to current conservation , it fulfills @xmath58 .",
    "periodicity in the matsubara time allows one to choose a rest frame for the heat bath given by the vector @xmath59.@xcite therefore , in this case we can write the vacuum polarization in momentum space in the form , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are both transverse in 2 + 1 dimensions , with @xmath61 being transverse and @xmath62 longitudinal in two spatial dimensions . thus , we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where latin indices refer to spatial dimensions . at the same time , @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 . at finite temperatures ,",

    "is given by @xmath71 , similarly to interacting graphene.@xcite the vacuum polarization screens this coulomb interaction , and we have , @xmath72^{-1}+\\pi_{00}(0,{\\bf q})\\}$ ] , allowing us to define the so called _ electric mass_,@xcite @xmath73 .",

    "the above results imply that no screening would occur at zero temperature if @xmath86 , i.e. , the screening takes place only when the chemical potential is located above the gap .",
    "this is a reasonable result , since this regime corresponds to a metallic state .    for temperatures above the curie temperature , @xmath87 , we have , @xmath88.\\ ] ] the above equation is also valid when no ferromagnetic material is in contact with the ti surface . in this case",
    "( [ eq : s - large - t ] ) is valid for all @xmath89 . interestingly , since we are dealing with interacting dirac fermions , we have that in absence of ferromagnetism eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - large - t ] ) would also apply to doped graphene @xcite if one replaces @xmath90 to account for the even number of dirac cones .",
    "next , we consider the finite temperature behavior of the cs term , which will yield a finite temperature correction to the berry phase on the ti surface .",
    "the finite temperature behavior of the cs term is generally a highly nontrivial matter,@xcite depending on the type of background field configuration involved .",
    "however , in our case we are mainly interested in the low - energy behavior , so that the calculation simplifies considerably .",
    "the calculation parallels the zero temperature one,@xcite and thus @xmath91 , where @xmath92 when the chemical potential is inside the gap , i.e. , @xmath93 , the surface state is insulating and we can take @xmath94 in the low - energy regime , since in this case @xmath95 yields the dominant energy scale in the problem and there is no fermi momentum .",
    "the effective action is local in this case , following straightforwardly from a derivative expansion . on the other hand , in the metallic regime where @xmath96 , the effective action is inherently non - local . in this case",
    "there is a fermi surface singularity with a fermi momentum @xmath97 .",
    "generally , the coefficient of the cs term , the so called topological mass , yields a measure of the hall conductivity , when scaled in appropriate unities .",
    "we will now show that in the insulating regime , the topological mass can be evaluated analytically at finite temperature and chemical potential . in this regime",
    "the cs contribution to the effective action is given approximately by , @xmath98 where in the above expression we have returned to real time and have defined @xmath99 .",

    "the above equation provides an analytical expression for the hall conductivity for the case where the chemical potential is inside the gap , i.e. , in the insulating regime .",
    "however , it differs from the actual hall conductivity @xmath104 when @xmath105 . in order to see this ,",
    "let us first compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) to the hall conductivity at zero temperature , where it can be calculated exactly for a nonzero chemical potential .          introducing the unit vector @xmath106 associated to the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath107 , we can write an expression for @xmath108 in terms of the topological charge density , @xmath109.\\ ] ] as @xmath110,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 $ ] are fermi - dirac distributions . thus , it is straightforward to compute @xmath104 at @xmath112 , @xcite @xmath113,\\ ] ] and we see that the hall conductivity at @xmath112 is non - quantized and non - universal in the metallic regime ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the topological mass , on the other hand , vanishes in the limit @xmath115 when @xmath116 , @xmath117 thus , when the system is in the metallic phase , the topological mass obtained from the low - energy regime of the cs action does not agree with the hall conductivity .",
    "this means that non - local corrections have to be considered in order to make the local effective action approach to agree with the expression obtained from linear response .",
    "further insight on this point is obtained by considering how the topological mass relates to the actual hall conductivity and see how it deviates from it in the metallic regime .",
    "first , we note that we can write , @xmath118 where @xmath119,\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath120 yields the deviation of the coefficient of the local contribution to the cs term from the hall conductivity when the chemical is above the gap .",
    "we see that for @xmath121 the contribution @xmath120 is responsible for canceling the non - quantized contribution at @xmath112 , since , @xmath122 precisely canceling the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_xy-0 ] ) .",
    "thus , we see that the chemical potential acts as a cutoff setting the limit of validity of the local effective action . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmat](a ) we show @xmath123 for a typical mean - field theory dependence with the temperature for @xmath95 . in order to plot @xmath124 and @xmath104",

    "@xcite performed on bi@xmath0se@xmath1/eus samples . there",
    "the estimated value for @xmath125 at the interface is considerably larger ( @xmath126 mev @xcite ) than the one obtained in _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for bi@xmath0se@xmath1/mnse,@xcite which features an antiferromagnet material ( mnse ) rather than a ferromagnetic one .",
    "the numerical calculation of the hall conductivity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmat](b ) .",
    "we note a plateau similar to the one arising for @xmath124 , which indicates that quantization nearly holds for finite @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a region of the @xmath127 plane determined by the inequality @xmath128 .",
    "however , there is also a region in the @xmath127 plane where the hall conductivity is non - quantized while the topological mass @xmath124 vanishes .",
    "note that sharp and large plateau regions up to @xmath129 [ fig . 1",
    ", panels ( a ) and ( b ) ] occur only if the gap is larger than @xmath87 , which is precisely the case in the experiment from ref . .",
    "in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "1 we also illustrate the opposite situation , taking for example , @xmath130 . observe that the plateau region here is not as sharp and loses its approximate quantization long before @xmath87 is reached .",
    "let us now derive the ll equation in the insulating regime where @xmath93",
    ". in this case the cs action ( [ eq : cs - action ] ) contributes to the ll equation in two different ways .",
    "this can be see by decomposing eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs - action ] ) into two parts , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the correction to the berry phase , and @xmath133 is the magnetoelectric contribution .",

    "note that within the one - loop accuracy of our calculations @xmath136 . thus , due to the magnetoelectric torque",
    ", the spin - wave excitation will be gapped in general .",
    "for instance , if @xmath137 with @xmath138 , we have , @xmath139 where in the absence of an external magnetic field , @xmath140 as @xmath141 .",
    "we have discussed the screening of the coulomb interaction on the surface of a ti at finite temperature and chemical potential . in the presence of proximity - induced ferromagnetism we found a peculiar behavior where the screening length depends on the magnetization via the electronic gap .",
    "this implies in particular that no screening occurs at zero temperature if the chemical potential is smaller than the proximity - induced fermionic gap .",
    "we have also calculated the coefficient of the cs term ( the topological mass ) analytically for finite temperature and chemical potential in the regime @xmath93 .",
    "this topological mass yields the hall conductivity in this regime and directly influence the magnetization dynamics at the surface , modifying the spin - wave velocity and inducing an magnetoelectric gap in the spin - wave excitation spectrum .",
