    "symbiotic stars were detected as moderately bright sources in the rosat / all sky survey .",
    "@xcite examined 16 symbiotic stars seen with rosat and categorized them into three classes : ( 1 ) super soft emission from the photosphere of the white dwarf ( @xmath0-type ) , ( 2 ) emission from an optically - thin thermal ( @xmath1 kev ) plasma possibly due to colliding winds from the two stars or to accretion ( @xmath2-type ) , and ( 3 ) an ill - defined category of relatively hard x - ray sources ( @xmath3-type ) . the origin of this hard emission remains uncertain to this day , and although not in the @xcite survey , the rosat observation of ss73 17 suggests it would likely have been placed in category ( 3 ) , albeit with some uncertainty due to the large column density ( n@xmath4@xmath5 ) required to fit rosat data @xcite .",

    "symbiotic stars have been poorly studied because in the optical only limited information can be obtained ; most of the interesting activity in these systems is , in fact , occurring in other bands .",
    "in addition , only a relative handful have been identified , @xmath19 200 @xcite out of an estimated 1,200 - 15,000 symbiotic stars with white dwarf accretors only in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "ss73 17 appears to be one of an even smaller category of `` hard x - ray emitting symbiotics '' , as noted above .",
    "the most significant question is why such a small number of systems ( _ e.g. _  ss73 17 , ch cyg , t crb , and rt cru ) emits in hard x - rays @xcite while most symbiotics are faint , soft x - ray emitters @xcite .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that , unlike typical symbiotics , these systems contain particularly high - mass white dwarfs , making them potential type ia progenitors .",
    "the most likely source of the hard x - ray emission from these symbiotic stars is the same as in cvs  the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the white dwarf @xcite . in the case of ss73 17 ,",
    "@xcite noted it is a strong hard x - ray source heavily absorbed in the soft x - rays , which we confirm with these follow - up",
    "_ suzaku_observations .",
    "we detected the same strong fe x - ray emission lines , but with some additional soft x - ray emission lines , and an increased soft x - ray continuum as well .",
    "our partial success with fits using a constant source and a variable partial absorber agrees with the picture suggested by @xcite , where the changing spectrum is due primarily to the absorbing material moving in and out of our line of sight .",
    "curiously , despite the long - term spectral changes that primarily affect the low ( @xmath20 kev ) energy spectrum and can therefore be described by changes in the partial absorber , our timing analysis shows that the short - term stochastic variations are larger when absorption is higher ( compare @xmath21 for the first and second _ suzaku _",
    "observations ) .",
    "this somehow could be linked to changes in the accretion rate , _",
    "i.e. _  more mass flowing through the disk , increasing the amount of absorption and increasing the viscosity in the disk .",
    "our analysis also points that , in general , the hard component ( 510 kev ) is more variable than its soft counterpart . in a cooling - flow scenario , we would expect a more turbulent plasma as it gets colder .",
    "this discrepancy , however , could be due to poor photon statistics in the soft x - ray band , although an increase in the bin size of the light curves , aiming at improving the signal - to - noise in each bin , would hinder the search for short - term variability",
    ".    the inadequacies of the fit at low energies could be due to a number of causes .",
    "we can suggest at least three possible sources for the soft x - ray emission",
    ". it could be due to photoionization of the red giant wind by the white dwarf , as proposed by @xcite , or could be created in a colliding wind shock between the m - type giant and the compact object .",
    "alternatively , these soft x - rays could be due to a wider range of emission measures from the thermal plasma which are only partially absorbed by a thick layer of gas and dust . with the available data ,",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between these models .",
    "the data do show that the hard x - rays from ss73  17 are largely thermal , due to the presence of a number of emission lines with clear thermal origin .",
    "we found that both the forbidden ( @xmath22 ) and resonance ( @xmath23 ) lines are present in the spectrum .",
    "the hetg results show that the lines are heavily blended with a g - ratio ( @xmath24 ) that supports a wide range of temperatures .",
    "however , this value is much lower than would be expected from a photoionized plasma ( @xmath25 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the / ratio is in good agreement with the temperature inferred from a bremsstrahlung model fit to the continuum .",
    "this thermal picture is further confirmed by the emission line and the likely detection of , which have been observed in a similar symbiotic system ( ch cyg ) .",
    "the results from the _ suzaku_observations suggest that the source is moderately variable in the long term primarily due to changes in the absorption .",
    "this is not surprising for an x - ray binary .",
    "however , the constancy of the fe k@xmath0  fluorescent line suggests that the mechanism generating this line is largely independent of the absorption , challenging the model presented in @xcite .",
    "they suggested that about half ( 0.13 kev ) of the fe k@xmath0 fluorescence was due to line of sight scattering in the absorbing medium , with 0.1 kev also coming from scattering off the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the new fits would predict only  0.065 kev from the absorbing material , or 0.165 kev in total , significantly less than the required amount .",
    "many questions remain about these unusual symbiotic systems .",
    "we have been able to confirm the thermal origin of most of the hard x - rays , although some fraction of the flux in the 15 - 50 kev band  the bandpass where this system was first noted by _ integral_and the _",
    "swift_bat  remains unexplained .",
    "however , it is worth to note that integral observations of rt  cru were well fit with a non - thermal powerlaw emission with photon index @xmath26=2.7 @xcite and therefore we can not discard the possibility that some fraction of the flux in 1550 kev band from ss73  17 has a non - thermal origin .",
    "however , it is still not at all clear if these systems are wind or disk accretors , and ultimately what drives the hard x - ray flux .",
    "more observations to determine the mass of the primary and/or secondary , as well as the orbital period of the system , would be extremely helpful in future modeling efforts .",
