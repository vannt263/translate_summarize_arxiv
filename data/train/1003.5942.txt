    "m13 was one of the first globular clusters identified as having unusually blue horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , and it remains one of the prototypes of the `` long blue tail '' with stars approaching the main sequence for helium stars . as @xcite notes , differences between stars on both giant branches and stars on the horizontal branch can be discerned from data in papers as early as @xcite .",
    "along with the nearby , massive , and little reddened cluster m3 , m13 forms half of the best known `` second parameter '' pair .",
    "the chemical composition of the hydrogen envelopes of hb stars affects their observable properties via opacity and mean molecular weight .",
    "the `` first parameter '' is heavy element content , where higher metallicity produces higher envelope opacity and generally redder stars . because m3 and m13 have nearly the same iron abundances ( @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath9 for m13 versus @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath10 for m3 ; @xcite ) but m3 has a much redder hb including a huge number of rr lyrae variable stars , a second parameter is needed .",
    "in addition to the color shift between the hbs of m3 and m13 , the hb stars in m13 show a bimodal distribution that is not present in m3 . on its own",
    ", this fact implies that the hb stars were produced by at least two different populations of cluster stars or involve different methods of producing hb stars .",
    "m3 and m13 share a number of similarities beyond iron abundance , and we tabulate some of their characteristics in table [ m13m3 ] .",
    "many theories have been proposed to explain the hb differences , and two of the main goals of this paper are to 1 ) assemble a large and complete set of photometric data for m13 , and 2 ) use the photometric data to examine questions bearing on the production of m13 s horizontal branch stars . because of the complexity of the hb , it is very doubtful that one explanation can cover all of its aspects .",
    "before we describe our results , we briefly summarize the main hypotheses we will examining , and the primary reasons they are viable .",
    "we emphasize that they are not mutually exclusive .",
    "early models showed that as the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope of an hb star is decreased , the surface temperature increases with relatively little change in luminosity . in this hypothesis , age differences between populations of stars lead to differences in mass between stars leaving the main sequence and between stars reaching the hb . while it is natural to expect that clusters in the milky way were born at different times , age differences are hard to prove except for clusters that are much younger than the average .",
    "@xcite compared m13 with m3 and found that turnoff - to - giant branch color differences and changes in hb morphology were consistent with an age difference @xmath11 gyr ( with m13 older ) .",
    "@xcite finds that the age differences implied by differences in the cluster cmds near the turnoff can explain the hb morphology as long as m3 is younger than about 12 gyr and the ehb stars in m13 are presumed to arise from a process that is unrelated to the age . however , there are aspects of m13 s population that can not be explained in this hypothesis .",
    "for example , neither of the studies above could reproduce the bluest hb stars in m13 in synthetic hb simulations using the same chemical composition and dispersion in stellar mass used for m3 .",
    "variations in helium content ( @xmath12 ) result in differences in position on the hb , largely because greater helium abundance allows lower mass stars to leave the main sequence at the present day @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that a helium abundance difference @xmath13 ( with m13 the more helium rich ) could be responsible for many of the unusual features of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , including an interesting difference in the slopes of the subgiant branch . @xcite",
    "also examined data for m3 and m13 , finding the luminosity of the red giant bump and rr lyrae stars relative to the cluster turnoff are consistent with an enhancement @xmath14 .",
    "this picture has been taken very seriously with the discovery of multiple stellar populations in some clusters .",
    "for example , ngc 2808 was found to have at least three identifiable main sequences @xcite , while @xmath15 cen has a blue main sequence @xcite that appears to be helium enriched @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 cen and ngc 2808 are among the most massive clusters known in the milky way , which may enable them to retain gas that has been processed and released by a first generation of stars .",
    "while the helium abundance is very difficult to measure except in limited circumstances , spectroscopic observations of other heavy element species lead to the belief that helium was probably enriched in some clusters .",
    "stars in m13 are well - known to have star - to - star abundance differences in o and na that can be traced from the giant branch @xcite to the main sequence turnoff @xcite .",
    "o depletion and na enrichment can only be accomplished in hydrogen - fusion regions where significant production of helium is accomplished @xcite , and star - to - star variations on the main sequence require that they must have been present in the gas forming the stars .",
    "the @xmath16 hypothesis is attractive for m13 because it may explain the blueward shift of the main body of hb stars compared to m3 s population , and the bimodality of the hb ( as an additional population within the cluster ) .",
    "@xcite conducted a fit to m13 s hb using helium - enriched models , and found that a fit required 70% of the population to be enriched to @xmath17 ( a mean @xmath18 ) , and the remaining 30% to be enriched to @xmath19 .",
    "there are some difficulties with this picture though . in the @xcite models of m13",
    ", they still needed to assume a rather large ( but constant ) total mass loss on the rgb ( @xmath20 ) . because m13 has few hb stars in the instability strip or redward ( where m3 s hb is heavily populated ) , _ virtually all _ of m13 s hb stars",
    "must also be more helium rich than m3 s .",
    "this is in striking contrast to more massive clusters that show strongly bimodal hb star distributions in which the redder hb population is interpreted as a first generation of stars formed from primordial material , while subsequent generations have varying degrees of enrichment and are bluer .",
    "the massive clusters that are inferred to have such large spreads in @xmath12 generally also have multiple main sequence or subgiant branch populations , whereas m13 has shown no sign of multiple populations to date .",
    "there is also not a clear bimodality in the spectroscopic abundances and a definite connection has never been made between the abundances and hb morphology ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* for indications that the maximum @xmath21 extent of the hb is correlated with the extent of observed na - o anticorrelations ) .",
    "@xcite attribute some of @xcite s conclusions to slight missteps in the implementation of their relative age comparison .    from early models",
    ", it was recognized that a significant amount of mass loss is needed , probably on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , to produce the colors of the majority hb populations in most clusters .",
    "dispersion in colors was then taken to mean that there are star - to - star differences in mass loss , although a mechanism to produce these differences has not been identified .",
    "independent of the majority of hb stars , there is a population that seems to _ require _ strong mass loss : the `` blue hook '' stars @xcite . in ultraviolet color - magnitude diagrams of some of the most massive clusters",
    "@xcite , stars are found fainter and redder than the zero - age hb ( zahb ) at its blue end , meaning that they must have almost no hydrogen envelope .",
    "if a star loses virtually all of its hydrogen envelope before reaching the tip of the rgb , it can leave the rgb without igniting core helium fusion .",
    "as the star contracts onto the he white dwarf cooling curve , a late he flash can be ignited that drives a convection zone that reaches hydrogen rich layers @xcite .",
    "as relatively cool hb stars convert he into carbon and oxygen , they are expected to eventually evolve brightward and redward toward the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "depending on the distribution of stars on the hb , evolving hb stars could be mistaken for fainter , more slowly evolving hb stars , thereby misrepresenting the brightness of the hb .",
    "clusters with large blue hb populations ( like m13 ) are most susceptible to this effect because evolutionary tracks may nearly parallel the zahb at the blue end of the hb distribution where the relative number of unevolved stars drops rapidly . because the hb is a frequently used standard candle in astronomy , it is worth studying the degree to which this affects stellar populations .",
    "evolutionary effects have been inferred from the pulsation properties of rr lyrae stars .",
    "for example , @xcite used magnitudes and periods to identify rr lyraes in different stages of their hb evolution .",
    "@xcite identified mean lines in the period - amplitude diagram for different subsets of m3 variables , and labeled them as regular or `` well - evolved '' .",
    "they showed that in at least some other clusters , the majority of variables could be identified with one group or the other .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we focused on post main - sequence evolution . using datasets from telescopes and instruments having a wide range in spatial resolution and field size , we attempted to completely survey the evolved stars from the center far into the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "we discuss the observational material and the analysis of the photometry in  2 . in  3 , we describe the steps used to identify the evolutionary status of the evolved cluster stars .",
    "we examine the red giant branch and horizontal branch populations in greater detail in  4 and  5 , respectively . in  [ ratios ] we look at population ratios and their relationship to the evolution timescales for stars in different stages . finally in ",
    "[ disc ] we discuss the body of evidence involving second parameter effects ( cluster to cluster variations ) and intracluster differences between stars .",
    "we used wfpc2 images taken in three different studies and acs images from one additional study for photometric measurements .",
    "the principal investigators and filters used are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the images from proposal 8174 were composed of three partially overlapping fields that were reduced separately and later combined .",
    "all of the wfpc2 images were processed using the hstphot package ( version 1.1.7b ) , which was described by @xcite .",
    "star positions for each set of processed data were derived using the iraf task metric , which we used to convert the hstphot pixel coordinates to ra and dec .",
    "metric positions often have absolute errors of up to 05 , but absolute errors are not important for our purposes .",
    "the ra and dec coordinates were converted to a system relative to the cluster center ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the data for each star , including coordinates , flight system magnitudes , and errors , were extracted from each dataset and merged into one master file . in cases",
    "where a star had multiple measurements in the same filter , the values were averaged using weights derived from the measurement errors .",
    "this master dataset was used to construct cmds that we used to identify post - ms stars .",
    "the f160bw images were reduced separately because the filter distorts star positions relative to the rest of the images , complicating the matching of stars within hstphot . after completing the photometry , we were then able to match all of the stars with previously identified hb and agb stars .    the acs wide field camera ( wfc ) images",
    "were processed using the dolphot package with its module for acs data .",
    "dolphot tasks mask bad pixels , correct for effective pixel area , and do point - spread function photometry .",
    "individual frames ( prior to drizzling in the acs pipeline ) were obtained from the hst archive in order to get photometry on stars covering the widest possible dynamical range ( including stars that were saturated on long exposures ) and to avoid the pixel resampling that goes along with the drizzling process .",
    "because the wfc sits far from the optical axis of _ hst _ , there is significant geometric distortion of these images . for the purposes of the photometry",
    ", the differences in effective pixel area were corrected within dolphot through the use of a pixel area map provided on the acs website .",
    "dolphot , however , does not currently correct pixel positions to sky coordinates . for the purposes of _ relative _ astrometry , we used the fourth - order polynomial corrections provided in the most recent idctab file for the dataset ( qbu1641sj_idc.fits ) .",
    "these corrections reduce distortions to about 0.1 pixels , which is more than adequate for our purposes .",
    "the star positions were later put on a common coordinate system with photometry from wfpc2 images as described below .",
    "the hubble space telescope is very effective at resolving the core of the cluster , but its approximately 3   by 3   field of view is insufficient to capture most of the cluster stars .",
    "we thus turned to the archive of the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) cfh12k camera for data covering the majority of the globular cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , with data collected by j .-",
    "park , y .- j .",
    "sohn , and s. j. oh in feb .",
    "2001 using @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and cousins @xmath24 filters .",
    "this camera is composed of a mosaic of 12 ccd s , of which we only used numbers 11 and 12 because these two chips covered the most heavily populated parts of the cluster .",
    "each chip covers a roughly 7   by 14   area of sky .",
    "the images we obtained from the cfht archive were already bias - subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "for the photometry , we used the daophot ii / allstar packages @xcite .",
    "star positions in the cfht images , like the hst images , needed to be transformed from pixel coordinates into angular offsets from the cluster center .",
    "we cross - identified stars from the usno a2.0 catalog , covering an approximately 18.3   by 16.7   area of sky around the cluster that encompassed the cfht field .",
    "these catalog stars were used to convert the cfht pixel positions into ra and dec coordinates relative to the core of m13 . in regions of overlap",
    ", the hst datasets were placed on the same coordinate system .",
    "we also reduced imaging the kpno 0.9 m telescope taken in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and cousins @xmath24 filters by bolte and sandquist on two nights in may 1995 .",
    "the camera used a single 2048 @xmath25 2048 ccd with a scale of @xmath26 per pixel , for a field of view @xmath27 on a side .",
    "the photometry was done similarly to the cfht dataset , and coordinates were transformed to the cfht system .",
    "we cross identified all stars from the proper motion studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the field covered by these studies is similar in size to that of the kpno images .",
    "for the brightest stars , membership probabilities were available to within about @xmath28 of the cluster center , while for fainter stars the innermost @xmath29 was effectively excluded .",
    "their photometry had a faint limit at @xmath30 , which is about 0.5 mag fainter than the red end of the hb .",
    "as a result , the proper motion membership probabilities were useful primarily for identifying bright stars that would otherwise contaminate post - hb and giant star samples .",
    "the archive of the ultraviolet imaging telescope contains aperture and point - spread function photometry of m13 produced following the procedures described in @xcite , and the images involved have previously been discussed by @xcite . however , in examining the uit images , we found a large number of sources that were not recorded by @xcite or in the uit archive file , and these match up with horizontal branch stars identified with optical photometry .",
    "it appears that the earlier photometry had an unnecessarily high faint limit .",
    "we therefore rereduced the two longest exposure far uv images ( using the b5 filter with central wavelength 1620  ) taken on the astro 2 mission ( fuv2418 , 192.5 s ; fuv2419 , 953.5 s ) .",
    "we downloaded archived idl reduction routines called mousse for use on linearized , flat - fielded digitizations of the original photographic images .",
    "the _ uit_find _",
    "routine identifies significant sources using an algorithm based on daophot , and determines centroided positions for each .",
    "the _ uit_aper _ routine conducts aperture photometry .",
    "we used a 3 pixel radius aperture recommended by @xcite and verified that the measurements matched the archived aperture photometry to within 0.01 mag for sources in common .",
    "the shorter fuv2418 exposure was analyzed to allow the brightest sources to be incorporated , as they were saturated on the longer exposure .",
    "many sources could be identified in the core of the cluster because crowding is relatively mild in the far uv . however , crowding does significantly modify the photometry , so we will generally restrict our discussion to stars more than 120   from the cluster center , as did @xcite .",
    "this partly resulted from the pixel scale ( pixels in the digitized photographs have a scale of about @xmath31 ) and tracking inaccuracy in the longer fuv2419 exposure .",
    "we identified a few instances of blending in the uit observations outside this radius when stars on the blue tail of the hb were close enough together on the sky .",
    "we rated uit detections by hand based on the apparent degree of contamination , and will only plot stars with the best ratings .",
    "we note that only in one case ( i d 72 ) did we find a star that was very likely to be a proper motion nonmember , and in two other cases ( uit source 568 ; i d 3904 ) did we find stars that could not be identified as hb or agb stars .",
    "i d 72 has optical photometry that places it only about 0.2 mag brighter than the hb level .",
    "we found no clear counterpart to uit source 568 ( @xmath32 ) , and hypothesize that it might be related to the faint uv sources found in hst photometry by @xcite .",
    "source ( i d 3904 ) corresponds to a bright blue straggler star in optical photometry .",
    "we calibrated the @xmath33 psf photometry from cfht to the standard system using standard stars from m13 described in @xcite .",
    "these standard stars are rigorously matched to the same photometric system as the earlier @xcite study .",
    "we obtained the 2 may 2005 update star list from the cadc website .",
    "the conditions for the cfht observations did not appear to be photometric , so the magnitude zeropoints for each image were free parameters in the calibration .",
    "standard stars in the stetson field cover almost the entire range of colors for evolved stars : from stars at the faint end of the hb distribution to a giant star within 0.5 @xmath23 mag of the rgb tip .",
    "three redder stars ( probably field ) were included to extend the color calibration closer to the color of the tip ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we found it necessary to calibrate the two cfht12k ccd samples separately because of significant differences in color terms .",
    "( this is consistent with the results of other studies  for an example , see @xcite . )",
    "using the ccdstd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) program , the standard star transformation equations were found to be : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 for chip 11 , and @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 for chip 12 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are instrumental magnitudes , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are standard magnitudes , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the zero points for individual frames .",
    "the @xmath47 color was chosen primarily for its wide wavelength spacing , which helps minimize the importance of photometric errors in @xmath22 or @xmath24 .",
    "we compared the final calibrated measurements with the stetson standard values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rsdstet ] .",
    "the comparisons include 417 stars from chip 11 and 286 stars from chip 12 .",
    "the median residuals @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 were all less than 0.003 mag for the samples from both ccds , and consistent with zero .",
    "there do not seem to be significant systematic trends at the extremes of the color range either .      for most purposes",
    ", we preferred to leave the hst datasets in flight system magnitudes using the vegamag zeropoints in order to maintain the relative precision of the original photometry and to make it possible for others to use improved transformations to a standard system in the future . however , to produce uniform samples of stars from photometric datasets in different regions of the cluster , we did need to derive some transformations .    because the cfht photometry appears to be accurately matched to the standard system and because the cfht images had good spatial resolution in the cluster core",
    ", we use this dataset to examine the calibration of the acs wfc photometry in @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the comparison involves hb and faint rgb stars because stars high on the rgb were heavily saturated even on the shortest exposures . in comparing the acs flight system magnitudes to the cfht photometry , it was clear that second - order color terms in color were needed to transform the f606w observations , but a first order term seemed sufficient to transform the f814w observations .",
    "this is in agreement with the transformations derived by @xcite .",
    "however , we found that when we used the @xcite transforms , the rgb stars were systematically too faint by about 0.04 mag .",
    "we therefore derived our own transformations .",
    "it was necessary to iterate the process , eliminating stars with large positive residuals ( most likely due to blending in the cfht dataset ) .",
    "the following transformations were derived from 437 stars : @xmath52 @xmath53 fig .",
    "[ rsdacs ] shows the comparison between the cfht photometry and the acs photometry calibrated to @xmath54 .    for a small number of stars , wfpc2 images were the primary source for photometry ,",
    "thanks to crowding and/or gaps in sky coverage .",
    "we used wfpc2 photometry in the vegamag system , but have calibrated measurements in the f555w and f785lp bands to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we first used the standard calibration of @xcite , but found that there were large color - dependent residuals . as a result",

    "[ rsdwfpc ] .",
    "although the formal errors on the quadratic term for the @xmath57 equation imply it has low significance , it was our qualitative judgement that it improved the transformation at the red end of the color range .    for a small number of stars at the faint end of the rgb in the cluster core ,",
    "the only reliable near - infrared measurements were in the wfpc2 field of proposal 8278 , and so this was also calibrated to cfht measurements using a sample of 87 rgb and hb stars : @xmath58 @xmath59 in the color range covered by the stars with wfpc2 photometry , the two calibrations typically agree to better than 0.05 mag .",
    "we observed landolt standard fields on one photometric night from the kpno run , and a standard star calibration using these data was used in calibrating cluster data from previous studies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have opted to calibrate the kpno photometry directly against the well - observed stetson ( 2000 ) standards in the m13 field used to calibrate the cfht data . to ensure the calibration of the evolved populations , we restricted the standard star sample to 343 stars brighter than the approximate turnoff of the cluster ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "after additional experiments though , we found that second - order color terms or changes to the standard star sample ( fewer main sequence turnoff standard stars , so that the giant and horizontal branch stars carried more weight ) did not significantly improve the fits .",
    "for most of the scientific applications later in the paper , the relative precision of photometric measurements within one dataset is most important .",

    "our first step was to first identify all known variable stars ( rr lyrae , bl her , bright giants ) from @xcite in order to eliminate stars that might confuse classifications .",

    "agb manqu   stars also deserve discussion . in optical cmds these stars ( post - hb stars that will not reach the traditional agb )",

    "we do not have an explanation for this .",
    "two stars ( hb 72 and 295 ) present reasonably strong cases in optical cmds for being manqu , but are not discernibly unusual in the uv , so we have left them as hb stars . finally , two manqu   stars ( agb 12 and 26 ) were identified using only optical photometry because they fell outside the hst ultraviolet observations , but in a region of the cluster where the uit images were too crowded to yield reliable measurements .",

    "detailed simulations are beyond the scope of this study , but to first order , the number of hot post - hb stars is quite small compared to hb stars in the same color range ( 17 / 191 = 0.09 for @xmath156 ) , which argues against large helium enrichment .",
    "one of the primary reasons for this study was to examine evolutionary timescales for stars in different life stages .",

    "because of the claim that m13 stars may have high helium abundances @xcite , it is particularly important to examine this population ratio . following the definition of @xcite and @xcite , we used @xmath161 ( the magnitude of the zero - age hb ) as the cutoff for the rgb sample .",
    "the determination of the faint limit for the rgb sample is important because the numbers of rgb stars rises quickly with increasing magnitude .    to determine @xmath161 , we applied two methods .",

    "zeropoint differences between our dataset and @xcite should therefore be small .",
    "however , nonvariable stars at the blue end of the instability strip have @xmath167 on average . using this as representative of the average hb level , @xmath168 .",

    "this does not account for the effects of hb morphology , however .",
    "theoretical models uniformly predict that blue hb stars have longer evolutionary times than rr lyrae variables or redder hb stars , which would produce high @xmath5 values in clusters with blue hb morphologies .",
    "@xcite , for example , conducted an early examination of the effect of hb lifetimes on the @xmath5 ratio , and @xcite found that clusters with hb@xmath175 show a larger spread around the mean than clusters with redder morphologies , which implied that the exact morphology of blue hb clusters might be influencing the @xmath5 ratio . in @xcite , we described a method for correcting @xmath5 for variations in hb lifetimes in a way that is based on observable quantities and is largely independent of chemical composition .",
    "the reader should see that article for more details , but we briefly summarize it below .    according to theoretical models , hb lifetimes vary similarly as a function of stellar mass and effective temperature , although the absolute value of the lifetime does depend on composition ( see the lefthand panels of fig .",

    ", we defined a weighting factor for each star in the hb sample : @xmath176 the largest portion of the variation in hb lifetimes occurs on the blue tail for @xmath177 k for stars with low - mass hydrogen envelopes . by choosing @xmath178 ( near the blue edge of the instability strip ) as the normalization point",
    ", we can correct the blue hb lifetimes back to values representative of the more common variable and red hb stars , and the @xmath5 value can be realistically compared to values from large studies of clusters with redder hbs @xcite .",
    "the variation of the weighting factors with @xmath179 is shown in the righthand panels of fig .",
    "[ hblife ] .",
    "although there is some variation in the weighting factors with composition , they clearly describe the lifetime variation to first order , so that residual uncertainties are at the level of a few percent .",
    "further , the weightings _ only _ remove the effects of position on the hb , and do not reference the absolute value of the hb lifetime , which depends on composition and physics inputs to the stellar evolution codes ( e.g. , the @xmath180c(@xmath181o reaction rate ; @xcite ) .",
    "although color-@xmath179 relationships remain imperfect , it is much more reliable to derive @xmath179 from photometry than it is to derive the stellar mass .",
    "for example , the grundahl @xmath105-jump has been found in many clusters with blue hb stars with @xmath182 k @xcite .",
    "in addition , the canonical hb also seems to have a reasonably well - defined termination near 30000 k. for the purposes of this study of m13 , we have used the @xmath179 determinations from @xcite using stromgren photometry .",
    "@xcite also measured @xmath179 spectroscopically , and while the spectroscopic measurements are in good agreement with the photometric measurements , the spectroscopic measurements are subject to significant model uncertainties at the faint end and appear to deviate systematically from photometric determinations at the red end of the hb .",
    "these measurements for m13 do not go all the way to the faint end of the hb , so we have assigned @xmath183 k to stars at the cutoff in the distribution ( @xmath184 ) based on measurements of ngc 6752 @xcite , which has similar metallicity and hb extent .    as expected from the analysis above",
    ", the use of different sets of models has a small effect on the weighted hb star total . in the case of some model sets ( dsep , @xcite )",
    ", we needed to extrapolate the weighting corrections in the range @xmath185 for an extremely small number of stars .",
    "overall the models agree that the hb sample should be corrected downward by approximately 10% , with @xcite ( @xmath186 ) and sweigart ( @xmath187 ) models giving @xmath188 , and dsep ( @xmath189 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath190 ) and sweigart ( @xmath191 ) models producing a lower @xmath192 .",

    "the value of @xmath5 produced by this analysis rests on the accuracy of the weightings used to correct the hb star total and on the determination of the faint cutoff for the rgb sample .",
    "if incorrect weightings were hiding a helium enrichment of @xmath7 among m13 hb stars , they would need to have been overestimated by about 28% .",
    "we remind the reader that the weightings are corrections _ relative _ to hb stars near the instability strip and are independent of the absolute value of lifetimes , so we believe that an overestimate of this magnitude would be difficult to produce .",
    "in addition , because we used weightings derived from models with @xmath198 , this would _ overestimate _ the weights for the bluest hb stars if those stars are actually helium - enriched , not underestimate them . if anything , our @xmath5 measurement is biased slightly too high .    to hide a helium enrichment through a systematic error in the rgb sample , it would be necessary to overestimate the number of stars , which would require a faint limit that was too faint . to produce a measured helium enrichment of @xmath7 , our faint limit would need to have been at @xmath199 , or 0.20 mag brighter than our brightest estimate .",
    "only a gross error in judging the level of the hb could produce an error this big , but the majority of the rr lyrae stars in the cluster dispute that , having @xmath200 @xcite . even if the rr lyrae stars are somewhat evolved , they are still _ fainter _ than the zahb level needed to produce a result of @xmath7 .",
    "( the rr lyrae stars will be discussed more below . ) from other indications ( such as @xmath127 ) , the hb of m13 is likely to be brighter than average for globular clusters if it is deviant at all . as a result , we do nt see a clear reason to dispute the helium abundance implied by the @xmath5 ratio .",
    "to avoid issues with systematic effects , it is worth doing a _ relative _ comparison between m13 and m3 .",
    "we assembled photometry for m3 from @xcite and @xcite , along with averaged photometry for the large population of rr lyrae variables from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this sample completely covers a @xmath201 area roughly centered on the cluster core .",
    "this contains 602 hb stars , which we subsequently corrected for lifetime effects .",
    "because m3 s hb morphology is much more horizontal than m13 s , we have used the @xmath65 color to determine lifetime corrections , in part due to questions about the calibration of the @xmath22 data in this cluster @xcite . for stars that had no @xmath24 measurement , we determined an empirical transformation from @xmath64 to @xmath65 using nonvariable hb stars from the @xcite data . for a handful of rr lyrae variables that did not have average brightness information , we assigned the star a color equal to the average color of variables of the same type ( rrab or rrc ) .",
    "the details are fairly unimportant because the normalization for the lifetimes is based on stars near the blue edge of the instability strip ( near the middle of m3 s hb ) and because lifetimes are theoretically predicted to vary little except on the blue tail .",
    "for m3 , the total lifetime correction amounted to just over 1% , with a corrected value of 594 stars .",
    "the cutoff magnitude for the rgb sample ( @xmath163 ) for m3 can be determined quite accurately , so that we only need to worry about possible zeropoint differences between the variable and non - variable star photometry .",
    "we used @xmath202 from @xcite , which was also the source of the zeropoint for the hst observations of @xcite .",
    "the rgb sample brighter than @xmath161 is 444 stars , which gives @xmath203 . according to this analysis",
    ", the m3 sample is consistent with having lower average helium abundance than m13 , but the values differ by slightly more than the error bars and the implied difference in @xmath12 is only about 0.015 .",
    "this is not enough to explain morphological differences in the cmd on the subgiant branch or hb .",
    "this is an interesting and somewhat surprising result that contradicts a number of previous studies of m3 and m13 that indicated that m13 is enriched in helium compared to m3 .",
    "for example , in their discussion of globular clusters with multiple stellar populations , @xcite identified m13 as a cluster composed almost entirely of stars enriched in helium by about @xmath204 . in a later simulation ,",
    "@xcite also model m13 s hb population exclusively with helium enriched stars , but in this case with 70% of stars having ranging from @xmath17 and 30% having @xmath205 . for comparison ,",
    "their interpretation of m3 s populations involves 50% of the stars having a near - canonical value of @xmath206 and 50% having @xmath207 .",
    "even if m13 s @xmath5 value is not corrected for lifetime variations , it still falls short of the value expected for the relatively small helium enrichment of @xmath7",
    ". we will discuss the cluster helium abundance in  [ disc ] .      as the morphology of the hb becomes more blue , the evolutionary tracks of stars after the hb phase start to shift from traditional agb tracks ( starting in a clump at the faint end of the agb and subsequently following a track paralleling the rgb ) to abbreviated agb tracks ( having an evolutionary pause separate from the traditional clump , touching on the traditional agb at moderate luminosities , and peeling away before reaching the tip ) to manqu   tracks ( retaining a surface temperature thousands of degrees higher than any part of the traditional agb ) .",
    "m13 contains hb stars that clearly span this range according to the number of traditional agb , supra - hb , and agb manqu   stars we identified in  5 . in view of the continuing difficulties in explaining the blue hbs of clusters like m13",

    "based on the bimodal distribution of hb stars ( approximately 47% of hb stars in the brighter peak , and about 28% in the fainter peak ) , we might expect to see evidence of an almost bimodal distribution of agb stars with the manquand supra - hb stars evolving from the bluest hb stars .",
    "the detected agb manquand supra - hb population is @xmath218 of the total population . if we assume as a first - order approximation that all agb stars have equal lifetimes",

    "independent of the position of the primary peak of the hb star distribution , the cause of blue hb tails has not been definitively identified .",
    "some studies have identified relationships between hb tails and cluster dynamical parameters such as central density @xcite and total luminosity @xcite , although neither of these can clearly explain differences between m3 and m13 because of their structural similarities ( see table 1 ) . while blue tails can plausibly result from a process ( such as mass loss or chemical self - enrichment ) producing a large dispersion in properties , m13 has a clear secondary peak in its hb distribution and this requires multiple star populations or the action of multiple physical processes . for example , theoretical models predict that varying amounts of mass loss on the rgb from star to star can produce a spectrum of outcomes from normal hb stars to early hot flashers ( stars which leave the rgb before the helium flash , but ignite helium shortly afterward ) to late hot flashers ( stars which ignite helium on the white dwarf cooling curve ) to helium white dwarfs ( which never ignite helium ) . to produce a secondary hb peak in this way",
    ", some mechanism must be concentrating stars in the cmd , and it is difficult to see how this can be accomplished without almost complete loss of the hydrogen envelope for many stars on the rgb . on the other hand , the self - enrichment hypothesis explains peaks on the hb ( not only at the blue end ) via discrete populations of stars with different chemical compositions .",
    "a peak at the blue end of the hb can be accomplished with a population of stars having extreme helium abundances ( @xmath224 ) because enriched stars leave the main sequence with lower total mass , and if the mass is low enough they will have almost no envelope by the time they reach the trgb .",

    "they are fainter ( @xmath227 f160bw@xmath229 ) and slightly redder than the blue end .",

    "the correlation between stars in the momany jump and the upturn in f160bw is not perfect , but it suggests that there is a coherent group of stars to be found on the extreme blue hb .",
    "the group does not fall at the precise end of the hb though , as we find in each cluster small numbers of stars that are bluer and fainter in the f160bw and @xmath1 cmds .",

    "the color histograms make it clear that the three clusters have very different distributions , with m2 s distribution declining toward the blue end , m80 with a broad but evenly spread group , and m13 with a well - defined peak and a large fraction of the stars in the momany jump .    while no spectroscopic data exists in the literature for m13 stars in this range , @xcite examined cooler hb stars ( 8000 k @xmath236 21000 k ) and found evidence of strong helium depletion and iron enrichment for @xmath237 12000 k. we can get additional guidance by contrasting spectroscopic results for ngc 6752 @xcite against those for ngc 2808 @xcite and @xmath15 cen @xcite .",

    "both spectroscopic signatures are consistent with the predictions of `` late hot flashers '' : stars that ignite helium on the white dwarf cooling curve , and initiating convective mixing of the envelope .    we are led to the same conclusion reached by @xcite : that the stars in the second @xmath1 jump are likely to be `` early hot flashers '' . in this case",
    ", the existence of a working hydrogen - fusion shell is thought to inhibit convective mixing into the outer envelope during core helium ignition . as a result ,",
    "no clear spectroscopic signature is expected and none has been found to date . because helium enrichment of the envelope plays a role in producing blue hook stars @xcite by reducing atmospheric opacity shortward of the lyman limit ( and reducing redistribution of flux to longer wavelengths ) , we examined the data for spectroscopically studied stars in the momany jump within ngc 6752 @xcite .",
    "we found no correlation between measured helium abundances [ which covered the range @xmath240 and @xmath1 magnitude , which seems to confirm that the envelope is still dominated by hydrogen .",
    "the scatter in helium abundance appears to be interesting , however  when @xcite combined their measurements for m80 and ngc 5986 stars with those from ngc 6752 , they found consistent helium depletion for stars hotter than the grundahl jump at @xmath238 k , but also found stars with larger depletions and generally larger star - to - star scatter in two temperature ranges ( 13000 k @xmath236 18000 k and 25000",
    "k @xmath236 31000 k ) .",
    "both of the helium depletion features appear to be associated with the @xmath1 jumps , although the details probably differ . for the grundahl jump ,",

    "the stars associated with the second @xmath1 jump in m13 are brighter than the majority of hb stars of similar ( but higher or lower ) temperature , as seen in the @xmath1 and f160bw filters .",
    "observationally , the radiative levitation of heavy elements and the downward diffusion of helium almost certainly must be involved because all stars with @xmath241 k ( excepting blue hook stars ) are found to have some degree of surface helium depletion , but the mechanics are still being debated .",
    "the transition at 11000 k is associated with the near - disappearance of the surface convection zone , but recent models @xcite indicate a need for a low - mass mixed layer near the surface to moderate the build - up of metals .",
    "there may be reason to attend to the effects of rotation because a discontinuity in average rotation speeds also appears at around this temperature ( with hotter stars largely being slow rotators ; @xcite ) . based on the evidence above , we considered whether progenitors of extreme hb stars such as early and late hot flashers can be identified on the rgb .",
    "early hot flashers are theoretically expected to only leave the rgb near the tip , while late hot flashers could leave at lower luminosities . while m13 appears able to produce both kinds of hot flashers , the second @xmath1 jump stars ( our early hot flasher candidates )",
    "are much more abundant .",
    "thus , we would expect that clusters with similar hb morphologies ( like ngc 6752 , m2 , and m80 ) to show symptoms of this near the trgb if anywhere .",
    "strangely , @xcite found that m13 s known `` super o - poor '' stars ( [ o / fe ] @xmath242 ) have high na abundances and most appear very close to the rgb tip ( @xmath243 ) , indicating the possible exposure of heavily processed gas at the surface .",
    "for perspective , @xcite summarize literature data for the well - known anticorrelation between [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] for stars in 20 clusters , and @xcite present new spectroscopic data for 19 clusters .",
    "the extent of the o - na anticorrelation varies from cluster to cluster , but it probably requires nuclear processing under conditions that can not be produced in gas that can be mixed to the surface in low - mass stars .",
    "this has led to the supposition that it results from pollution by previous generations of more massive stars .",
    "even so , super o - poor stars are quite rare and , to the best of our knowledge , have not been seen among relatively unevolved turnoff and subgiant branch stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this could be due to difficulties in detecting low oxygen abundances among faint stars .",
    "in addition , the cluster ngc 2808 has a large population of blue hook stars and seemingly few or no early hot flasher candidates , and contains super o - poor stars as well @xcite but these are fairly uniformly spread down the rgb ( although those authors did not observe stars at the tip of the rgb ) .",
    "@xmath15 cen also has a large population of blue hook stars , and appears to have a population of super o - poor stars @xcite . in the cases of ngc 2808 and @xmath15 cen",
    "though , there is clear evidence of both self - enrichment and multiple populations , which may complicate the interpretation .",
    "examination of bright giants in ngc 6752 @xcite have revealed no super o - poor stars .",
    "in addition , mg isotope ratios in m13 @xcite and ngc 6752 are correlated with the o depletions among bright giants , but the conditions necessary to process mg are not expected in rgb stars based on current nuclear reaction rates . the sample of @xcite hints at the possibility of smaller populations of super o - poor stars in clusters like ngc 3201 and m5 , neither of which have extreme hb stars .    though there is strong evidence of mass loss effects on the extreme bhb , there is still little to connect this directly to the properties of stars still on the rgb .",
    "one outstanding question that deserves theoretical attention involves the position ( redder than the extreme end of the hb ) and clumping of the early hot flasher candidates in the cmd .",
    "even if helium is enriched overall in the bluest hb stars , some non - standard physics is probably required to produce their observed characteristics because helium - enriched ehb stars should be fainter than ones with primordial helium abundance .",
    "we can suggest two types of observations that might help to clarify the situation .",
    "first , in clusters with stars concentrated near the blue end of the hb , stars at the trgb may have chemical peculiarities similar to those in m13 if they are preparing to have early hot helium flashes .",
    "if found , this could result from excessive mass loss or from highly helium - enriched stars , but it would connect rgb and extreme hb stars .",
    "second , in clusters with predominantly red hbs , spectra for blue hb stars in a limited range of @xmath179 near the instability strip may reveal their initial helium abundances @xcite .",
    "this would be a direct observational test of whether helium enrichment has produced _ any _ blue hb stars .",
    "while there is circumstantial evidence of helium enrichment in clusters like ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 @xcite , spectroscopic proof should be possible .      because the @xmath5 ratio seems to rule out previously suggestions of helium enrichment in m13 , we discuss the literature on m13 to see if the observations can be reconciled .",
    "the main evidence pointing toward a helium enrichment falls into several categories : 1 ) morphology of the hb , 2 ) luminosity of the hb and the rr lyrae variables , and 3 ) morphology of the subgiant branch .",
    "m13 and m3 have long been a `` second parameter pair '' based on the distribution of stars on their hbs  the small difference in [ fe / h ] ( the `` first parameter '' ) between the two clusters is unable to explain the much bluer hb stars in m13 . before discussing further",
    ", we emphasize that we are mainly considering the shift in the cmd position of the `` most representative '' hb stars in the two clusters , and not the differences in the shape of the hb distributions .",
    "our goal is not to model the hb morphology in detail .",
    "m13 has an unexplained bimodal hb distribution as well as a significant number of stars between the two peaks , but arguably the brighter peak ( @xmath244 ; slightly bluer than the instability strip ) is the most representative based on star numbers .",
    "by contrast , m3 has a unimodal distribution with the peak of the distribution falling within the instability strip @xcite .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have used @xmath245 ( the dereddened color of the peak of the hb star distribution ) as a way of describing the most representative hb stars in clusters , although this indicator starts to lose sensitivity on the steep blue tail .",
    "we used our earlier results from histogramming the @xmath24 magnitudes of hb stars , and then translated the resulting position to the @xmath69 color using a fiducial line .",
    "we find @xmath246 and @xmath247 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite give @xmath248 for m3 .",
    "if the clusters have nearly identical chemical compositions , this corresponds to a difference of about @xmath249 in hb star mass ( teramo models ) . unfortunately , this does not transform to a similar mass difference at the cluster turnoff if common red giant mass loss formulas are applied because they are nonlinear with star mass .",
    "if m13 is helium enriched compared to m3 by @xmath250 , the mass difference is virtually the same .",
    "helium enrichment in m13 does not remove the need for a difference in mean mass between its hb stars and those in m3 .",
    "the mass difference can be explained with reasonable assumptions in both the @xmath251 and @xmath16 hypotheses , and we refer the reader to  1 for a brief summary of recent attempts to model m13 s hb . in the @xmath251 hypothesis , m13 s stars are older than m3 s . in the @xmath16 hypothesis",
    ", helium enrichment allows less massive stars to leave the main sequence earlier , _ but _ a large amounts of mass loss is still necessary for each star .",
    "while this may be correct , the picture is not fully motivated by physical reasoning . as discussed in  [ redhb ] , the sharp red edge of the bright peak and the population of redward - evolving hb stars may provide new constraints on fits in the @xmath16 hypothesis .",
    "we encourage synthetic hb studies that pay closer attention to these features .",
    "the luminosity of the hb is most strongly affected by metallicity and helium abundance ( @xmath252 mag ) , and is insensitive to age . however , without accurate and independent measurements of distance and extinction , the luminosity must be determined relative to other cluster stars . most commonly , the reference landmarks are found among ms stars ( such as the turnoff or a fainter point identified with the help of the turnoff ) or rgb stars ( like the rgb bump ) .",
    "these methods have generally indicated that m13 s hb is luminous compared to other clusters , but the reference points usually have the disadvantage of having their own dependencies on composition and age that complicate the interpretation . in the discussion below , we will focus on the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath253 gyr @xcite hypotheses for explaining differences between m3 and m13 , but we must consider the evolution hypothesis ( see  1 ) at the same time .    when the cluster turnoff is used as a reference , it introduces a dependence on age ( @xmath254 mag / gyr ; @xcite ) and increases the dependence on helium ( @xmath255 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "we determined @xmath256 , which gives @xmath257 if we apply our value for @xmath258 at the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "this value is larger than any previously quoted ( see @xcite for a summary ) , and if we use the @xcite value for @xmath259 , the value would be higher still ( 3.76 mag ) .",
    "the larger values of @xmath127 depend entirely on whether the rr lyraes and `` reddest blue hb '' stars near the instability strip ( see  [ redhb ] ) are evolved or not .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite observed much smaller samples in m13 , and an examination of their cmds shows that together they only observed two `` reddest bhb '' stars among the 55 we identified  understandable considering that most of these stars are in the core of the cluster . as a result , @xcite quote a value for @xmath258 that is 0.19 mag fainter than ours .",
    "we also note that like the studies of @xcite and @xcite , our photometry for the hb and turnoff regions are on a consistent zeropoint .",
    "we see no reason to dispute earlier values of @xmath127 for m3 , given that m3 s hb is well - populated on either side of the instability strip .",
    "so if m13 s reddest hb stars are not evolved , it has an extreme value for @xmath127 ( almost 0.2 mag larger than that of m3 ) , and this is consistent with both the @xmath251 and @xmath16 hypotheses . to find the cause ( the hb , to , or both )",
    ", we need other reference points .",
    "@xcite conducted a similar comparison between m3 and m13 using hst @xmath1 observations . in @xmath1 , the subgiant branch and a section of the blue hb",
    "become flat , making them excellent magnitude references .",
    "the authors found no significant difference between the @xmath260 derived for the two clusters . while this does not directly bear on the luminosity of the hb near the instability strip ,",
    "it is an indication that the bluer hb of m13 has a normal luminosity compared to m3 .",
    "the red giant bump can also be used as a reference point , dependent on helium abundance ( @xmath261 mag ; @xcite ) and age ( @xmath262 mag / gyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed value for the difference @xmath263 can be put in context using the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite . to ensure a reliable comparison , we calculated the correction from @xmath258 to @xmath264 according to the @xcite prescription .",
    "we therefore derive @xmath265 , which falls right among those for clusters of similar metallicity ( for example , m3 has @xmath266 ) .",
    "however , their tabulated value for @xmath161 is 0.14 mag fainter than ours  this is partly a reflection that the photometry they used @xcite lacked stars near the instability strip , and partly that they used synthetic hb calculations to derive the level of the zahb relative to the hb stars they did observe . using the fainter zahb , m13 s value for @xmath267 becomes significantly different from m3 s value , and falls at the low end of the distribution for similar clusters .",
    "so if the rr lyraes are showing us the true zahb level , neither age nor helium changes are necessary but ca nt be ruled out because the expected changes are @xmath195 level .",
    "if the zahb has a fainter level , rather large differences are needed ( @xmath268 , or @xmath269 gyr ) .",
    "the tabulation of @xcite measured values for both m3 and m13 using homogeneous photometry and a template - fitting method for determining @xmath161 for troublesome clusters like m13 that have very blue hbs .",
    "their @xmath267 values are in agreement to within the measurement errors . ) as a potential helium indicator , with larger magnitude differences implying higher helium . in their comparison",
    ", they found that m13 had a magnitude difference that was @xmath270 larger than that of m3 , which they admitted had relatively low significance . because our photometry of the bump and main sequence constitutes a homogeneous dataset with a much larger number of stars",
    ", we checked their quoted bump and turnoff magnitudes ( derived from the photometry of @xcite ) .",
    "we find there is a rather large difference in color ( 0.08 mag ) between the @xcite photometry and ours , but the @xmath23 magnitudes are almost identical to ours . on their own , the rgb bumps of the m13-m3 pair do not give a strong constraint on helium abundance , although @xcite showed that clusters with predominantly blue hbs had larger @xmath271 than clusters that have strong populations in the instability strip . ]    the brightness of the agb clump is fairly independent of metallicity @xcite , but when the magnitude difference with the hb is formed , the dependences on helium abundance and rgb progenitor mass almost completely disappear @xcite .",
    "although m13 has a sparsely populated agb clump , there is a fairly clear grouping of 12 stars at @xmath272 . using the bright zahb level from the previous paragraph",
    ", we have @xmath273 .",
    "this is slightly smaller than the value for m3 ( @xmath274 ) from @xcite , but only about @xmath195 different . if the fainter zahb level is applied , the m3 and m13 values agree to within about 0.03 mag .",
    "the results might also be affected by likely lower mean hb mass in m13 compared to m3 , which affects how the clump is populated and would tend to reduce the luminosity of the clump .",
    "we consider this weak evidence in favor of the fainter zahb level .",
    "the hb luminosity can be constrained using the end of canonical hb as a reference in clusters with long blue tails .",
    "like ngc 6752 , m13 s hb appears to terminate essentially at the end of the canonical hb , and we identified blue hook candidates ( in  [ notable ] ) and second @xmath1 jump stars ( in  [ bimodal ] ) that mark points in the hb near the end .",
    "models show that the difference in magnitude between the termination of the blue hb and the blue end of the instability strip grows substantially larger with increasing helium abundance , mostly because the horizontal part of the hb gets brighter .",
    "the faint end of the hb is fairly insensitive to helium abundance because the hydrogen - rich envelopes of the stars are almost gone .",
    "if the end of theoretical zahbs are shifted in magnitude to fit the end of m13 s hb , the bright end is consistent with primordial helium values ( see fig . [ hbends ] ) .",
    "while the fit is understandably uncertain due to the gap between the hb stars and the blue hook stars in optical filters , the teramo evolutionary tracks do go nearly parallel to the faint envelope of hb stars ( see fig .",
    "[ hbtervi ] ) .",
    "the fit seems to rule against helium enrichment among stars within and redder than the primary peak .",
    "evolutionary effects among the reddest hb stars would tend to bias toward an indication of helium enrichment , so this result seems fairly robust .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of stars near the red end of the hb in m13 and ngc 6752 also support the idea that the outer envelopes have _ not _ been significantly processed through the cno cycle , and ( in ngc 6752 ) still have primordial helium abundance @xcite",
    ".    alternately , if the zahbs are fit to the red end of the hb , helium - enriched zahbs are far too red at the faint end , lending additional credence to models with canonical composition .",
    "however , current models of the bluest hb stars do not fully incorporate important physics such as diffusion and radiative levitation , and these effects seem to be responsible for the @xmath105 jump and the intra - peak hb stars that are brighter than canonical models . as a result , fits to the hb",
    "should be treated somewhat skeptically .",
    "finally , we consider the distance moduli implied by the hb ( specifically the rr lyrae stars ) and by the trgb .",
    "both of these features are in common use as standard candles , and a comparison of the resulting values might also give us clues on whether the hb is unusually bright .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the trgb in @xmath24 is almost independent of age and chemical composition . from the calibration of @xcite",
    ", we calculate @xmath275 , which gives @xmath276",
    ". the distance modulus could be smaller than this if by chance m13 does not contain rgb stars very near the flash stage . to evaluate this possibility",
    ", we can use a binomial distribution to calculate the probability that at least one star is within a certain magnitude range of the trgb . in our cluster - wide sample , there were 271 stars brighter than the rgb bump ( @xmath277 ) . using theoretical rgb luminosity functions that fit m13 s population ( see  [ rgb ] ) , stars brighter than that level have an approximately 0.4% chance of being within 0.01 mag of the trgb , so that a calculation using the binomial distribution predicts a 70% chance of having at least one of the 271 stars within that interval .",
    "the probability rises to about 90% that at least one star is within 0.05 mag of the trgb , so this is probably a minor source of error .",
    "all of the brightest rgb stars are known to be semi - regular variables including the brightest ( v11 ) , having an amplitude of about 0.13 mag in @xmath23 and a timescale for variability of about 30 d @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the variability of the brightest giants is a significant source of error in our determination of @xmath278 .",
    "though @xcite made observations over 70 d ( more than two cycles for most giant variables ) , it is possible they did not sample the full amplitude of variation .",
    "our cfht @xmath23 measurement of v11 ( which was used above ) was 0.15 mag brighter than the average given by @xcite , while our kpno observation was only about 0.06 mag brighter ( barring zeropoint differences ) . if we can assume that the @xmath24 observations are off by similar amounts , this gives @xmath279 .",
    "the range of variation for other bright rgb stars ( v17 , v24 , v38 , and v42 ) overlap that of v11 , and all but one give corrected distance moduli within 0.03 mag of the v11 value .",
    "v17 gives a significantly brighter value ( 14.37 ) , but it also has the largest amplitude ( 0.38 mag ) of the red giant variables tabulated by @xcite .",
    "we believe the agreement among 4 of the 5 variables is sufficient to identify the trgb , which in turn implies @xmath280 with a very conservative uncertainty of 0.10 mag .",
    "although there is still considerable discussion of the rr lyrae @xmath281[fe / h ] relation , recent consensus views ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply a mean rr lyrae value @xmath282 for m13 s metallicity . with @xmath259 from the @xcite observations of m13 rr lyraes ,",
    "this gives @xmath283 .",
    "the disagreement with the trgb distance modulus can again be relieved if the rr lyraes in m13 were significantly evolved or were helium enriched ( @xmath284 ) .",

    "this is fainter than all of the `` reddest bhb '' stars but approximately the same brightness as the blue end of the primary peak .    once again , a comparison with m3 is useful , thanks to that cluster s huge rr lyrae population .",

    "the difference between @xmath289 for the most evolved rr lyraes in m3 and that of m13 s rr lyraes is most consistent with magnitude differences derived from comparing points like the rgb bump and agb clump @xcite .",
    "evolution is also expected to affect the pulsational properties of stars within the instability strip because the mean density of evolved stars is lower than for unevolved stars , resulting in larger periods .",
    "we could expect to discern evolutionary effects in several ways : based on observations derived solely from the light curves ( such as the bailey period - amplitude diagram ) , period - luminosity relationships ( with luminous rr lyraes having longer periods ) , and color distributions ( with evolved stars likely to be spread more evenly through the instability strip due to their short evolutionary timescale ) .",

    "the three bl her stars ( population ii cepheid variables ) fall approximately in the part of the cmd where stars that have evolved from the blue hb tail are predicted to pass , and their periods ( all greater than a day ) also support evolved status .",

    "these clusters have relatively low hb@xmath291 values ( @xmath292 ) , and ngc 2419 and m68 have significant red hb populations as well .",
    "both of these factors imply that there are likely to be unevolved stars in the instability strip .",
    "this group of ooii clusters , however , is outnumbered by clusters like m13 that have almost exclusively blue hb stars .",
    "for example , m2 @xcite is a massive cluster that has more rr lyrae stars than m13 , but still has a very small fraction of its stars in the instability strip . for comparison , we compiled data for clusters with only a few rr lyraes , under the hypothesis that these stars are more likely to have evolved from the blue hb .",
    "the bailey diagrams ( @xmath23 amplitude versus period ) for the different samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ avp ] .",
    "m13 rrc variables fall in parts of the bailey diagram that are commonly occupied by variables in other ooii clusters . in the bhb cluster group and",
    "most of the other clusters , a significant fraction of the rrc variables fall near @xmath293 .",
    "this group appears largely independent of cluster metallicity .",
    "the main exceptions are ngc 5286 , which is more metal rich than m3 and has an analogous group that is much closer in period to m3 rrc variables , and m2 , which does nt have a clear concentration of rrc variables in the bailey diagram .",
    "the second identifiable group of m13 rrc variables overlaps with groups in the bhb cluster sample and in @xmath15 cen , and has @xmath294 and @xmath295 . from these diagrams , we conclude that there are not clear evolutionary signatures that be inferred from the bailey diagram alone",
    ".    strangely , there are proportionately few short period , low amplitude rrc variables in the `` protoypical '' ooii clusters m15 and m68 . in addition , both of these clusters have populations of double - mode rrd variables that largely reside in a small range of color between the rrab and rrc variables @xcite .",
    "such a distribution is unlikely if most of the stars are evolved bhb stars  evolution accelerates as a star moves redward toward the agb .",
    "conversely , we find that the shortest period ( @xmath296 ) rrc stars are the bluest rr lyrae stars in ooii clusters .",
    "many of the known non - radial pulsators in ooii clusters @xcite are also found within this group . at best , we find that bailey diagrams for ooii rrc stars provide some information about average colors .",
    "this is somewhat useful for examining the effects of evolution within individual clusters because some color distributions ( especially ones biased toward the red ) are incompatible with model predictions .",
    "however , the rrc do nt appear to follow patterns implied by m3 , in which `` well evolved '' stars appear shifted to greater period .    in summary",
    ", the majority of the evidence from photometric indicators implies that the m13 rr lyraes ( and nonvariable stars of similar color ) are significantly brighter than the zahb level .",
    "the most notable exception involves the comparison to the rgb bump , while the pulsation properties of the rr lyraes themselves are somewhat ambiguous . if the reddest hb stars are discounted as significantly evolved , then m13 s blue hb appears to fall at approximately the same luminosity level as m3 s and the evidence for helium enrichment or age differences from this is removed .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "one of the more unusual aspects of m13 s cmd is the steeper slope of its subgiant branch in comparison to m3 s .",
    "this was interpreted as resulting either from helium enrichment @xcite or greater age @xcite .",
    "both of the cited papers used the so - called `` horizontal method '' to compare the ages of clusters with other clusters or isochrones .",
    "higher helium abundance or age tends to shorten the length of the subgiant branch , so that if the turnoffs are aligned in color and fainter main sequence points ( usually 0.05 mag redder than the turnoff ) are subsequently aligned in magnitude , the relative position of the giant branch reveals the difference .",
    "it has been verified repeatedly that there is a difference between m3 and m13 , but the cause is unclear .    we can attempt to look at the problem from a different angle by realizing that age and helium enrichment affect the absolute colors of the turnoff and red giant branch in different ways . an increase in helium abundance reduces the opacity of the stellar envelope , making surface temperature higher at both the turnoff and on the red giant branch . on the other hand , increased age makes both the turnoff and red giant branch redder , although the effect on the giant branch is very small . because reddening and metal abundance differences have large effects , reliable comparisons of absolute colors can only be done when these are well - determined",
    " m3 and m13 are probably the best example of such a pair .",
    "@xcite discusses them in this respect , but we expand on the arguments here .",
    "the reddenings for the two clusters appear to be small and very similar ( m13 probably with the larger reddening by @xmath297 ; @xcite ) and their metallicities appear to agree to within 0.1 dex ( with m13 being the more metal poor ; @xcite ) .",
    "one additional benefit of using the m3/m13 pair is that the effects of the reddening and metallicity differences on the turnoff should partly cancel , with the metallicity differences leading to an expectation that m13 s turnoff should be bluer than m3 s by about 0.01 in @xmath71 , and less in other optical colors .",
    "a comparison in absolute colors also requires datasets for which the calibration can be done uniformly for both clusters .",
    "while we are unable to do this because our deep exposures of m3 and m13 were not taken on the same photometric night , it has been done in the most recent studies , although using different colors . @xcite used @xmath65 and found that m13 was bluer at the turnoff and giant branch by similar amounts ( @xmath298 ) .",
    "this implies a tiny helium enrichment ( @xmath299 ) at most . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite used the @xmath64 color and found that the turnoff colors were virtually identical , although m13 s red giant branch was still significantly bluer .",
    "we examined the standard star photometry of @xcite for the two clusters ( 8 november 2007 update ) , and found that in the @xmath65 color m13 is bluer than m3 on the giant branch and at the turnoff ( in agreement with @xcite ) , while in @xmath64 or @xmath71 colors m13 s turnoff is significantly _ redder _ ( even accounting for small differences in reddening ) and the giant branches have nearly identical colors ( see fig . [ tos ] ) ( about 0.04 mag when reddening was accounted for ) for images of the two clusters taken on the same night under photometric conditions using the same equipment . ] .",
    "based only on the stetson standard stars in @xmath64 and @xmath71 colors , an age difference appears tenable . with the @xmath65 color",
    "included , neither helium nor age differences seem capable of explaining the observations because neither is expected to affect one color differently than others .",
    "we conclude that current photometric datasets do not paint a consistent picture , and may still be influenced by subtle systematic effects . to make this a stringent test",
    ", effort should go into deep and carefully calibrated photometry using filters with a wide wavelength baseline .",
    "the @xmath71 color still appears to be a good choice .",
    "to our minds , some of the most important questions regarding m13 remain in dispute .",
    "one question that we have reopened here is whether the reddest of the blue hb stars in m13 are significantly evolved ( and whether they are therefore good representatives of the brightness of the horizontal branch ) .",
    "the weight of the observational and theoretical evidence leans toward the idea that they are significantly evolved , and that the red edge of the primary hb population is a decent indicator of the true hb level .",
    "the distribution of stars on the horizontal branch in m13 is complex , and the most notable questions regard 1 ) how the color of the primary peak in m13 could have been shifted so far relative to m3 s when the gross composition of clusters appear nearly identical , and 2 ) how a large fraction of m13 s rgb stars become blue stars near the end of the canonical hb . our examination of the luminosity function shows little sign that a large fraction of stars leave the bright rgb before having a core flash , in agreement with the massive cluster ngc 2419 @xcite but not with ngc 2808 @xcite .",
    "we do not find any clear evidence of helium enrichment among the stars of the dominant ( redder ) hb population , and in fact , the helium abundance indicator @xmath5 and the relative brightness of the hb argue against significant enrichment .",
    "the hb and rgb stars ( and different subsets of these ) do not show significant signs of radial segregation within the cluster .",
    "the small color difference between the main sequence turnoff and the giant branch of m13 ( in comparison to m3 ) remains unexplained , but careful examination of the absolute colors of both clusters would provide a new test .",
    "our thorough search of m13 s hb population has revealed second @xmath1 jump and blue hook stars that imply that many of these stars have very low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes .",
    "far uv observations show that many of the stars in the second @xmath1 jump are more luminous than stars with similar colors at the end of the hb .",
    "the reason is unclear , however .",
    "spectroscopic data on similar stars in ngc 6752 @xcite indicate that the excess brightness is not related to enhanced atmospheric helium abundance , so further study is required .",
    "spectroscopic measurements may help to clarify our understanding of extreme hb stars in a number of ways .",
    "we particularly encourage studies of : stars near the red end of the hb in m13 where helium abundances can be accurately determined @xcite ; stars in the extreme hb to look for signs of unusual mg abundances ( a species that appears to be minimally affected by diffusion ) that could connect them to giant stars ; o , na , and mg for stars at the red giant tip of other clusters to determine whether they are super o - poor ; relatively unevolved turnoff and subgiant stars in m13 and ngc 2808 to search for large o depletions ( [ o / fe]@xmath300 ) and check whether this is the result of external pollution or not .    we would like to thank d. pollard for contributions to the paper , s. cassisi for graciously providing tabulations of cmd positions of hb stars for various degrees of central helium depletion , and the anonymous referee for a careful reading .",

    "<S> we have analyzed photometry from space- and ground - based cameras to identify _ all _ bright red giant branch ( rgb ) , horizontal branch ( hb ) , and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars within 10   of the center of the globular cluster m13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we identify a modest ( 7% ) population of hb stars redder than the primary peak ( including rr lyrae variables at the blue end of the instability strip ) that is somewhat more concentrated to the cluster core than the rest of the evolved stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find support for the idea that they are noticeably evolved and in the late stages of depleting helium in their cores . </S>",
    "<S> this resolves a disagreement between distance moduli derived from the tip of the red giant branch and from stars in or near the rr lyrae instability strip . </S>",
    "<S> we identified disagreements between hb model sets on whether stars with @xmath0 k ( near the `` knee '' of the horizontal branch in optical cmds ) should evolve redward or blueward , and the differences may depend on the inclusion of diffusion in the stellar interior . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp cut at the red end of m13 s hb provides strong evidence that stars from the dominant hb group must still be undergoing blue loops , which implies that diffusion is being inhibited . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that m13 s hb is a somewhat pathological case  the dominant hb population occurs very near the `` knee '' in optical cmds , and evolved stars exclusively appear redward of that peak , leading to the incorrect appearance of a continuation of the unevolved hb . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two stars as `` blue hook '' star candidates  the faintest stars in optical bands that remain significantly subluminous in the shortest ultraviolet wavelength photometry available . </S>",
    "<S> m13 also has a distinct group of stars previously identified with the `` second @xmath1 jump '' . </S>",
    "<S> based on far uv photometry , we find that these stars have genuinely high temperatures ( probably 26000 k @xmath2 k ) , and are not produced by a jump in brightness at lower temperature ( @xmath3 k ) as previously suggested . </S>",
    "<S> these stars are brighter than other stars of similar color ( either redder or bluer ) , and may be examples of `` early hot flashers '' that ignite core helium fusion shortly after leaving the red giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> we used ultraviolet photometry to identify hot post - hb stars , and based on their numbers ( relative to canonical agb stars ) we estimate the position on the hb where the morphology of the post - hb tracks change to @xmath4 , between the two peaks in the hb distribution .    concerning the possibility of helium enrichment in m13 </S>",
    "<S> , we revisited the helium - sensitive @xmath5 ratio , applying a new method for correcting star counts for larger lifetimes of hot horizontal branch stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that m13 s @xmath5 ratio is in agreement with theoretical values for primordial helium abundance @xmath6 and inconsistent with a helium enhancement @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness of the horizontal branch ( both in comparison to the end of the canonical hb and to the tip of the red giant branch ) also appears to rule out the idea that the envelopes of the reddest hb stars have been significantly enriched in helium . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute colors of the turnoffs of m3 and m13 may potentially be used to look for differences in their mean helium abundances , but there are inconsistencies in current datasets between colors using different filters that prevent a solid conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> the numbers of stars on the lower red giant branch and in the red giant bump agree very well with recent theoretical models , although there are slight indications of a deficit of red giant stars above the bump . </S>",
    "<S> there is not convincing evidence that a large fraction of stars leave the rgb before undergoing a core helium flash . </S>"
