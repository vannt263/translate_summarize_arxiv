    "<S> we perform a new study of the chances of the fluorescence detector ( fd ) at the pierre auger observatory to detect the tau leptons produced by earth - skimming ultra high energy @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new and more detailed evaluation of the effective aperture of the fd that considers a reliable fiducial volume for the experimental set up . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we take into account the real elevation profile of the area near auger . we find a significant increase in the number of expected events with respect to the predictions of a previous semi - analytical determination , and our results </S>",
    "<S> show the enhancement effect for neutrino detection from the presence of the near mountains .    </S>",
    "<S> dsf-17/2005 , ific/05 - 36    ,    ,    95.85.ry,13.15.+g,96.40.tv,95.55.vj,13.35.dx    neutrinos constitute one of the components of the cosmic radiation in the ultra high energy ( uhe ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> since we have detected ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , the presence of a secondary uhe neutrino flux is guaranteed as a result of the @xmath1-photoproduction , due to the interaction of hadronic uhecr with the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of these _ cosmogenic neutrinos _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in addition to a possible primary neutrino flux , would provide precious information on the physics and position of their powerful astrophysical sources . on the other hand , copious neutrino fluxes </S>",
    "<S> are also predicted in more exotic _ </S>",
    "<S> top - down _ scenarios where relic massive particles , produced at the first moments of the universe , decay into uhe lighter particles , among which neutrinos and photons are expected . in any case , the detection of uhe neutrinos would significantly contribute to unveiling the still unknown origin of uhecr .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the very low expected fluxes and the small neutrino - nucleon cross section , neutrinos with energies of the order of @xmath2 ev and larger are hardly detectable even in the new generation of giant array detectors for cosmic radiation , like the pierre auger observatory ( auger , in short ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of uhe neutrinos inducing inclined air showers was recently reviewed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a promising strategy concerning the detection of the tau leptons produced by earth - skimming uhe @xmath0 s has been analyzed in a series of papers @xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> uhe @xmath3 s , with energies in the range @xmath4 ev , have a decay length not much larger than the corresponding interaction range . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if a uhe @xmath0 crosses the earth almost horizontally ( earth - skimming ) and interacts in the rock , the produced @xmath3 has a chance to emerge from the surface and decay in the atmosphere , producing a shower that in principle can be detected as an up - going or almost horizontal event .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to perform a new , more refined , estimate of the effective aperture of the fluorescence detector ( fd ) at auger to earth - skimming uhe @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation of the number of possible up - going @xmath3 showers detectable with the fd has already been performed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by using a semi - analytical computation . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis represents a considerable improvement with respect to the estimate of this last work , since it uses a different method for calculating the number of @xmath0/@xmath3 events , which now includes a class of tracks neglected in the previous calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> an additional improvement in our analysis comes from considering the effects of the topology around the auger observatory site , by using a digital elevation map ( dem ) of the area around the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed dem of the earth surface is provided by aster ( advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer ) @xcite which is an imaging instrument that is flying on terra , a satellite launched in december 1999 as part of nasa s earth observing system . </S>",

    "<S> the auger position and surface , approximated to a rectangle , is indicated in red . ]        </S>",
    "<S> we will define the auger _ </S>",
    "<S> fiducial _ volume as that limited by the the six lateral surfaces @xmath5 ( the subindex @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 labels each surface through its orientation : west , east , north , south , up , and down ) , and with @xmath12 a generic direction of a track entering @xmath5 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ volume ] . we have considered a simplified auger area , given by a @xmath13 km rectangle ( an approximation to the real one , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , while the height of the fiducial volume was fixed to 10 km in order to be within the range of detection of the fd eyes . </S>",
    "<S> this is a conservative estimate , since we expect that the effective fiducial volume for the detection at the fd will be larger .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath14 be an isotropic flux of @xmath15 . by generalizing the formalism developed in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the number of @xmath3 leptons emerging from the earth surface with energy @xmath16 , going through @xmath5 and showering in the fiducial volume per unit of time ( thus potentially detectable by the fd ) , is given by @xmath17 where @xmath11 is the duty cycle and @xmath18 is the detection efficiency of the fd , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum energy for the @xmath3 leptons , @xmath2 ev , is chosen taking into account the energy threshold for the flourescence process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kernel @xmath19 is the probability that an incoming neutrino crossing the earth with energy @xmath20 and direction @xmath21 , produces a lepton emerging with energy @xmath16 , which enters the fiducial volume through the lateral surface @xmath22 at the position @xmath23 and decays inside this volume ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ volume ] for the angle definition ) . in eq.([eq:1 ] ) , due to the very high energy of @xmath0 , we can assume that in the process @xmath24 the charged lepton is produced along the neutrino direction .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , this process can occur if the following conditions are fulfilled ,    * the @xmath0 with energy @xmath20 has to survive along a distance @xmath25 through the earth ; * the neutrino converts into a @xmath3 in the interval @xmath26 ; * the created @xmath3 emerges from the earth before decaying with energy @xmath16 ; * the @xmath3 lepton enters the fiducial volume through the lateral surface @xmath5 at the point @xmath23 and decays inside this volume .    </S>",
    "<S> \\1 ) the probability @xmath27 that a neutrino with energy @xmath20 crossing the earth survives up to a certain distance @xmath25 inside the rock is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the charged current ( cc ) interaction length in rock ( @xmath30 g/@xmath31 ) </S>",
    "<S> . a detailed discussion of an updated evaluation of the neutrino - nucleon cross section , @xmath32 , can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath33 on the particular track direction can be safely neglected , since it is well known that the interesting events are almost horizontal and thus the experienced earth density is essentially equal to @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 ) the probability for @xmath35 conversion in the interval @xmath36 $ ] is @xmath37    \\3 ) the probability @xmath38 that a charged lepton survives as it loses its energy travelling through the earth is described by the coupled differential equations @xmath39 here @xmath40 gev , @xmath41s denotes the @xmath3 mean lifetime , whereas the parameters @xmath42 @xmath43 g@xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath43 g@xmath44 gev@xmath44 , as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , fairly describe the @xmath3 energy loss in matter ( for further references and a recent discussion , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the transferred energy as @xmath46 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) . by solving eq.s </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) at the emerging point on the earth surface one has @xmath47 where @xmath48 the quantity @xmath49 represents the total length in rock for a given track entering the lateral surface @xmath5 of the fiducial volume at the point @xmath23 and with direction @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath16 of the exiting lepton must be consistent with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is enforced by the presence of a @xmath50-function in the final expression of the probability @xmath51 , @xmath52 4 ) once the @xmath3 lepton has emerged from the earth surface , its showering probability is determined by the total distance it has to travel for reaching the fiducial volume . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote with @xmath53 the total length travelled in the atmosphere by the @xmath3 before reaching the point @xmath23 on the surface @xmath5 , and with @xmath54 the length of the intersection of the track with the fiducial volume , the decay probability inside the fiducial volume is given by @xmath55 collecting together the different probabilities in eq.s ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] ) , ( [ eq:11 ] ) and ( [ decay ] ) , we have @xmath56 since the flux can be reasonably assumed isotropic , namely @xmath57 we can rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) , summing over all the surfaces , as @xmath58 where the effective aperture , @xmath59 , is the sum of each surface contribution , @xmath60 and @xmath61    in order to get the explicit expression for @xmath62 an extremely involved integration has to be performed , which requires the computation of all the properties for each track ( @xmath23 , @xmath21 ) , taking into account the dem of the auger site . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> a suitable approach is based on the following procedure : we use the available dem of the auger area to isotropically generate a large number of oriented tracks ( let us say @xmath8 ) which cross the auger fiducial volume . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote with @xmath63 the subset of the @xmath8 tracks which enter through surface @xmath5 , then the kernel @xmath62 can be well approximated by the expression @xmath64    we show in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the origin of the difference between the two calculations can be explained in the following way . in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> an event is rejected if the @xmath3 takes more than 30 km to decay ; this means that almost horizontal events ( where the @xmath3 emerges from the earth far from the lower surface of the experiment , travels more than 30 km before entering in the fiducial volume , and then decays inside it ) , preferred by the lateral surfaces due to the @xmath66 term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kernel3 ] ) , were not included in the calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while they are present in this analysis . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ apertures ] the different contributions from each surface are plotted together with the results of ref.@xcite ( thin solid line ) . as one </S>",
    "<S> can notice , the contribution coming from the tracks going through the down surface ( thick solid line ) is in nice agreement with our previous calculation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is possible to distinguish a north - south effect and , more consistent , a west - east effect .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth observing the different high energy behavior of the aperture corresponding to the d surface , @xmath67 , with respect to the others . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the neutrino energy would select the almost horizontal tracks , which however are depressed , for the d - surface only with respect to the lateral ones , by the factor @xmath68 .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the number of @xmath3 s showering into the fiducial volume that enter through each lateral surface are reported , as well as the total number of events for each flux . </S>",

    "<S> a new and more detailed computation of the aperture for earth - skimming @xmath0 of the fluorescence detector at the pierre auger observatory has been performed . </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation has been carried out by using a different approach with respect to the previous semi - analytical one of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and taking into account the real elevation profile of the area around auger . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results show an increase of the effective aperture , and correspondingly of the number of the expected events . </S>",
    "<S> this larger result is mainly due to the contribution of almost horizontal earth - skimming @xmath3 s , emerging from the earth surface far away from auger but decaying inside its fiducial volume . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably the presence of mountains near auger leads to an enhancement factor on the total number of events of the order 1.3 - 1.6 . </S>",
    "<S> as previously shown ( see e.g.  the discussion in @xcite ) , our results indicate that the number of uhe neutrino events at auger is comparable for showers induced by down - going uhe neutrinos and by the decays of @xmath3 s produced by earth - skimming uhe @xmath0 s .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth observing that the efficiency of the fd detector , whose parameterization we have used in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) , can be considered as oversimplified and that one should expect a behaviour of fd much more complicated with energy and/or geometry of the event . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , a complete and exhaustive analysis of this issue is still absent and thus not available for any analysis like ours . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our predictions can be considered as a first but probably useful step in the right direction , which should motivate more study inside the auger collaboration for example in order to obtain a reliable efficiency of fd with energy and for horizonal showers .    </S>",
    "<S> possible future improvements of the present work should take properly into account the response of the flourescence detector , as well as the real geometry of the auger area and the fact that some of the uhe @xmath76 tracks could partly traverse water . </S>"
