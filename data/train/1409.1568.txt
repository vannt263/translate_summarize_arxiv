    "the principle of a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) system is to share secure keys between two remote users .",
    "different from the ways employing mathematical techniques to avoid eavesdroppers , the unconditional security of qkd originates from quantum physics , and has been theoretically proved @xcite . since muller et al .",
    "successfully implemented the first qkd experiment over 23 km installed optical fiber under lake geneva @xcite , several groups have demonstrated their qkd experiments in field environments @xcite .",
    "qkd has moved far beyond laboratory experiments .",
    "commercial qkd systems are available from some companies , and moreover , european telecommunication standards institute has published standards for qkd to fulfill urgent market needs @xcite .    as an important milestone , quantum network , or more precisely qkd network , was proposed to extend qkd from point - to - point configuration to multi - user and large - scale scenario @xcite . based on the passive beam splitter , townsend et al . presented and realized the first qkd network @xcite . and since then , researchers have devised and developed an impressive collection of network architectures for qkd @xcite . combined with increasingly mature qkd devices , these developments enabled qkd networks to be deployed over real - world telecommunication networks . under us defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) , researchers from bbn technologies , boston university and harvard university built the world s first qkd network across a metropolitan area ",
    "darpa quantum network @xcite .",
    "then , based on the quantum router structure @xcite , our group from university of science and technology of china realized the second field qkd network in the commercial telecommunication fiber network in beijing in march 2007 @xcite . the secure communication based on quantum cryptography ( secoqc )",
    "network in vienna integrated 6 different qkd systems together through trusted repeaters @xcite . also , `` q - government network '' built by our group was a field trial of application of quantum keys @xcite . in 2010 ,",
    "the most high - speed qkd network was presented in tokyo , where the live video conferencing using one - time - pad ( otp ) encryption was successfully demonstrated @xcite .",
    "long - term performance of qkd networks have also been tested @xcite , in which swissquantum network @xcite ran for more than one - and - a - half year . and , other qkd networks were also deployed in the field environment @xcite .        in order to furthest extend the applicability of qkd technologies , qkd networks leverage available fiber networks , and take advantage of the technologies , components and topologies for conventional fiber communications @xcite .",
    "figure [ fullnetwork ] illustrates the schematic overview of one qkd network , which is a wide area qkd network , and for the sake of simple illustration , only four cities are included .",
    "the wide area qkd network is composed of metropolitan area qkd networks and intercity backbone qkd network which consists of long - haul intercity qkd links among metropolitan area qkd networks .",
    "the metropolitan area networks usually span several tens of kilometers @xcite , such as the typical range of smart cities is 30 - 80 km @xcite , while distances of intercity links at least exceed 50 km @xcite . although the transmission distance of qkd systems is already over 250 km @xcite , quantum techniques including trusted repeater , quantum repeater @xcite , and ground - to - satellite communication @xcite would be used in the intercity link to extend the distance scale , and multiplex techniques @xcite would also be employed to increase the key rate .",
    "the tradeoff between key rates and relay distances is one of the key issues should be considered before intercity qkd links are deployed . in each city ,",
    "the metropolitan area qkd network comprises metropolitan core networks and quantum access networks .",
    "the metropolitan core network is the core part of the metropolitan area qkd network , which usually has a mesh configuration to provide all - to - all interconnections among the network nodes , the interconnectivity should be taken into account when we plan the core network .",
    "the quantum access network encompasses connections that extend from one node in the metropolitan core network to multiple end - users , and provides the last - mile qkd service for subscribers @xcite .",
    "therefore , quantum access network usually follows point - to - multipoint topology and covers a few tens of kilometers @xcite . and , subscribers belonged to different quantum access networks are connected through the metropolitan core network .    in this paper",
    ", we present a wide area qkd network demonstrated in the field environment .",
    "the network was installed in the anhui provincial telecommunication fiber network of china mobile ltd .",
    ", with over 150 kilometers coverage area .",
    "three cities and two metropolitan area qkd networks were linked up by intercity qkd links to form the wide area qkd network , in which one metropolitan area qkd network was a typical full - mesh core network based on the qkd router and switch techniques to offer all - to - all interconnections , and the other one was a simulative quantum access network using the 1@xmath0n switch to realize the point - to - multipoint configuration .",
    "the whole wide area qkd network ran for more than 5000 hours , from 21 december 2011 to 19 july 2012 , and part of the network stopped until last december . to adapt to the complex and volatile network environment ,",
    "standardized design of qkd devices and several networking techniques were tried when the wide area qkd network was field deployed . and",
    ", we also developed and tested two typical applications of quantum keys on this qkd network .    compared with previous qkd networks",
    "@xcite , the hefei - chaohu - wuhu qkd network is not only the first wide area qkd network , but also shows significant improvements on the qkd networking scheme and technology . in the respect of networking scheme , for the core qkd network , we designed and implemented the novel all - to - all scheme based on the combination of passive and active optical elements , and for the quantum access network , we proposed and implemented the practical point - to - multipoint scheme based on the optical switch . beyond novelty ,",
    "these networking schemes make the qkd network more reliable , flexible and reconfigurable . in the respect of networking technology ,",
    "we have successfully resolved two crucial issues  the symmetry of qkd devices and seamless switching among different links .",
    "these successes further enhance the competitiveness of qkd network in the field environment .",
    "the geographic distribution of the wide area qkd network is presented in fig .",
    "[ nodes ] , hefei , chaohu , and wuhu are three connected cities in the network .",
    "the hefei - chaohu - wuhu wide area qkd network consists of three parts : ( 1 ) hefei metropolitan area qkd network , which has 5 nodes , one node is in wan - tong post and telecommunication ( wtpt ) co. ltd . , the other 4 nodes are all in the campuses of university of science and technology of china ( ustc ) , both library ( lib ) and key laboratory of quantum information ( klqi ) are located in the east campus , other two nodes respectively locate in the north campus ( nc ) and west campus ( wc ) , and these 4 nodes compose the quantum campus network of ustc ( qcn - ustc ) ; ( 2 ) wuhu metropolitan area qkd network , which has 3 nodes that are located in the telecom room ( tr ) of china mobile , wuhu branch ( whb ) of china mobile , and asky quantum technology co. ltd .",
    "( qasky ) ; ( 3 ) hefei - chaohu - wuhu ( hcw ) intercity qkd link , which combines hefei and wuhu metropolitan area qkd networks together through the trusted intermediate node lies in the chaohu branch ( chb ) of china mobile . 6 nodes are located in the north of changjiang river , and the other 3 nodes are located in the south of changjiang river , hence the hcw wide area qkd network is the first qkd network across the changjiang river .",
    "there are 8 optical fiber links among 9 nodes in the wide area qkd network , as the yellow lines in fig .",
    "[ nodes ] .",
    "all the 8 optical fiber links are characterized as table [ link ] .",
    "the total length of the installed fiber is almost 200 km , of which the intercity fiber length exceeds 150 km .",
    ".characteristics of fiber links in the hefei - chaohu - wuhu wide area qkd network .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "just as stucki et al . said in reference @xcite , the test of the performance of the encryption application was not the primary goal of the field qkd network . however , the encryption applications are the motive force of development of quantum cryptography , and the integrated technology of qkd device ( the quick and secure key refresh server ) and encryptor should be developed .",
    "take the thales mistral products for example , the encryptors could not deal with a key renewal period lower than 3 seconds @xcite . here",
    ", two typical applications of the quantum keys from our qkd devices were developed and tested on this wide area qkd network .",
    "the first one was the one - time pad encryption medium for the public switch telephone network ( pstn ) .",
    "this encryption medium was added between pstn and traditional terminals , such as the conventional telephone and fax machine .",
    "it s very convenient for subscribers who do not need to change their original telephone and fax machines , even their operative habits , the encryption medium was completely transparent in normal circumstance without security requirements .",
    "the keys used for one - time pad encrypted voice data came from the qkd server in two ways , one was real - time transport , which was tested on the qcn - ustc , the other one was downloading and storing in a secure digital ( sd ) card , which was tested on the link between klqi in hefei and qasky in wuhu .",
    "the second one was the symmetric encryption virtual private network ( vpn ) security gateway for public networks .",
    "this vpn gateway integrated the qkd technology and the existing classical ipsec protocol together , and was completely compatible with conventional hardware and software in the internet . the 256-bit advanced encryption standard ( aes ) encryption",
    "was employed to guarantee the security .",
    "the secret seed keys for aes derived from and refreshed by the qkd server . in this wide area qkd network ,",
    "the vpn security gate was tested among subscribers in hefei and subscribers in wuhu .",
    "the seed key refresh rate for the vpn gateway was limited by the intercity qkd link , which could only support the rate about 3 256-bit keys per second .",
    "network applications like the file transfer , internet telephone , video chat , and multimedia - based tripartite conference were tested .",
    "we have shown that the dynamic qkd network can be field installed and run steadily in wide area for long term . through sharing communication infrastructures from china mobile ltd . , the hefei - chaohu - wuhu wide area qkd network provided a secure and stable key distribution platform for subscribes in two cities ( hefei and wuhu ) that are over 150 kilometers apart .",
    "four qkd nodes in hefei city were combined together by two dynamic routing components to form a typical full - mesh metropolitan core network , in which there were up to eight different direct qkd links only by multiplexing four fiber channels . in wuhu city ,",
    "the point - to - multipoint metropolitan network was composed by three qkd nodes and one 1@xmath02 switch to simulate a quantum access network .",
    "these two typical qkd networks and hcw - intercity qkd link ran for more than 5000 hours , and even the qcn - ustc part for about two years , the stable operation of the hefei - chaohu - wuhu wide area qkd network has proven the reliability and robustness to the field environment of qkd networks .",
    "we have successfully field tested the wide area qkd network prototype , and also realized the effective integration between p2p qkd techniques and networking schemes , owing to the following developments : ( 1 ) standardized design of qkd devices to facilitate establishment and maintenance of qkd networks ; ( 2 ) resolution of symmetry problem of qkd devices to clear obstacles in the way towards cost - effective technology for qkd ( especially for one - way phase coding system ) , and also convenient to dynamically add new qkd nodes ; ( 3 ) seamless switching in dynamic qkd network based on stable qkd systems and networking techniques .",
    "in short , results from hefei - chaohu - wuhu wide area qkd network demonstrate that qkd technology actually has the potential to be widely deployed .",
