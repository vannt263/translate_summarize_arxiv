    "in recent years , there has been considerable interest in the study of systems composed of two or more ( equispaced ) electron layers . the advances in the nanoscale semiconductor fabrication technology ( such as the molecular beam epitaxy , the lithography techniques , etc . ) have made available these electron systems in the coupled semiconductor quantum - well structures with a good control on the electron number density and the interwell spacing .",
    "a variety of new interesting phenomena have been observed , due entirely to the presence of interlayer coulomb interactions .",
    "the stability of new fractional quantum hall states @xcite and the discovery of an insulating wigner crystal ( wc ) phase @xcite , in the bilayer electron system in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , are some prominent examples .",
    "theoretical @xcite as well as recent diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) @xcite studies have predicted , even in the absence of magnetic field , the stabilization of the wc phase in the electron bilayer in the close proximity of layers @xmath0 ( see below for the definition of relevant parameters ) at sufficiently low electron density .",
    "more precisely , the critical density for the phase transition is predicted to shift towards the higher density side as compared to the corresponding value in the case of an isolated electron layer . in the following we shall be confining our discussion to the double layer system .",
    "central in understanding the behavior of the layered electron systems are the intra- and interlayer many - body correlation effects .",
    "since the early random - phase approximation ( rpa ) study by das sarma and madhukar @xcite , there have been many investigations focusing on the role of many - body correlations .",
    "the theoretical techniques used have mostly relied on the extensions to two dimensions ( 2d ) of existing theories .",
    "zhang and tzoar @xcite , neilson and co - workers @xcite , and zheng and macdonald @xcite have used the mean - field approximation of singwi , tosi , land , and sjlander ( stls ) @xcite to study the effect of correlations on the various ground - state properties of an electron bilayer system . on the other hand , kalman and co - workers @xcite",
    "have incorporated correlations by satisfying the third - frequency sum rule of the density - density response function to study the collective modes .",
    "a general conclusion has emerged that the interlayer interactions add further to the importance of many - body correlations , which are already known to be very important in an isolated electron layer @xcite . both in the stls and kalman s group approaches , correlations enter in the theory in the form of a static local - field correction ( lfc ) . in stls ,",
    "the lfc s are obtained numerically in a self - consistent way , while in the latter approach their calculation rely on the knowledge of accurate pair - correlation functions .",
    "the extent of validity of the stls or other theories in the present context can be tested by making a direct comparison with the accurate dmc simulation results of rapisarda and senatore @xcite .",
    "however , no such comparison of the stls results has been made so far .",
    "a comparative study is available only in case of an isolated electron layer @xcite , where it has been found that the stls theory , although providing a significant improvement over the lower order random - phase and hubbard @xcite approximations , yet it fails to give an adequate description of correlations beyond @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", it yields negative value for the pair - correlation function ( an unphysical result ) at small separation for @xmath1 .",
    "this failure of the stls approach also appears in the bilayer problem @xcite . as usual , here @xmath2 is the dimensionless density parameter , with @xmath3 the effective bohr atomic radius and @xmath4 the in - layer areal number density .",
    "@xmath5 is the effective ( band ) mass of electron .",
    "we recall that @xmath6 also provides a rough estimate of the in - layer coupling , as ratio of the ( independent particle ) potential and kinetic energies of the system .",
    "the failure of the stls theory at higher @xmath6 has been traced back to its basic assumption of treating as static ( i.e. , time - independent ) the electronic exchange - correlation hole@xcite .    in the two - layer system",
    ", the interlayer interactions will result in an increase in coulomb coupling as compared to that in an isolated layer at the same density .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the dynamics of correlations will be even more crucial in the two - layer system , with respect to an isolated layer .",
    "this forms part of our motivation for the present work . here",
    ", we intend to examine the ground - state behavior of the symmetric electron - electron ( e - e ) bilayer by including dynamic electron correlation effects . to this end , we make use of the dynamic or quantum version of the stls approach ( qstls ) .",
    "the qstls theory embodies correlations beyond the conventional stls approach and as an important improvement , its lfc is frequency - dependent .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the so - called qstls theory was originally developed by hasegawa and shimizu @xcite for the 3d electron system , and that its predictions of many - body properties , as adjudged by comparison with the mc results , are better irrespective of the dimensionality @xcite and the carrier statistics @xcite . in view of the very recent dmc study of the symmetric electron - hole ( e - h ) bilayer by de palo , rapisarda , and senatore @xcite",
    ", we also employ the qstls theory to examine the ground - state properties of such system .",
    "for both the e - e and e - h bilayers we present results for the pair - correlation functions , the lfc factors , and the ground - state energy over a wide range of density and layer spacing .",
    "we also look for signs indicating an instability of the homogeneous liquid with respect to inhomogeneous phases of the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) and wc type .",
    "finally , we compare our results with those of the dmc studies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present in brief the qstls formalism for the double - layer system .",
    "results and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in section iv",
    ", we conclude the paper with a brief summary .",
    "we consider a double quantum - well structure with @xmath7 as the center - to - center well separation .",
    "the carriers are electrons in one well and electrons or holes in the other , respectively for the e - e and e - h bilayer .",
    "the motion of carriers is free along the @xmath8-plane and under the action of a double well potential profile in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "we assume that the wells are extremely narrow and the potential barriers along the @xmath9-axis are high enough so that the particles occupy only the lowest energy subband for the @xmath9 motion and there is negligible overlap between the wave functions of particles in the two wells .",
    "the wells are assumed to be identical in each respect except for the charge of carriers in the e - h bilayer .",
    "further , the bilayer system is assumed to be embedded in a uniform charge neutralizing background . on neglecting the effect of integrating over the finite extent of the particle wave function in the @xmath9-direction , the coulomb interaction potential among the carriers",
    "is obtained as @xmath10 with @xmath11 the layer index and @xmath12 the intralayer interaction potential . above @xmath13",
    "is the background dielectric constant and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , for the e - e and e - h bilayers .",
    "apparently , the ground state of the above bilayer model will depend , apart from @xmath6 , on the interlayer spacing @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out convenient to introduce an additional coupling parameter as the ratio of the typical interlayer and in - layer coulomb energies , namely , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , at @xmath17 , which is the case considered here , the bilayer model may be completely specified by @xmath6 and @xmath18 ( or @xmath7 ) .      in the dielectric approach , the density - density linear response function @xmath19 , which describes the response to an external potential @xmath20 that couples to the particle density , plays the role of a central quantity in determining the many - body properties of the system .",
    "for the bilayer , the linear response matrix @xmath21 is formally defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the induced particle density in the @xmath24th layer and @xmath25 the potential that couples to the density in the layer @xmath24 . for completeness , we give in the following a very brief account of the qstls formulation of the density response for the two - layer system .",

    "the stls curves are also depicted in the same figures .",
    "we first discuss the results for the e - h bilayer : looking at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( ( a)-(g ) ) , we infer immediately that the pair - correlation functions in qstls are in overall better agreement with the dmc data than those in stls . among the notable features , the qstls theory , as a marked improvement over stls , accounts fairly well for the oscillatory structure that develops in the dmc @xmath63 and @xmath64 with increasing @xmath6 , both in terms of amplitude and period .",
    "the qstls @xmath63 satisfies the positive definiteness criteria of probability for @xmath6 up to @xmath70 , whereas the stls @xmath63 becomes slightly negative at small @xmath71 for @xmath1 .",
    "we also notice that , common at each @xmath6 , the quality of agreement between theory and dmc data somewhat diminishes for increasing values of @xmath18 . moreover , quite similar is the trend of agreement with increasing @xmath6 at a given value of @xmath18 ; for instance , compare @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this shortcoming of the qstls theory seems to stem from the fact that the frequency - dependence in its lfc s represents a quantum - mechanical correction to the conventional stls theory , while the dynamics of spatial correlations among carriers , which is expected to become vital at higher values of coulomb coupling , is still missing .",
    "it can in fact be shown @xcite that the qstls lfc s reduce formally to the frequency - independent stls lfc s in the limit @xmath74 .    since decreasing @xmath7 at a given @xmath6 or increasing @xmath6 at a given @xmath7 result in an increase in the coulomb coupling among carriers in the bilayer , the qstls assumption of static spatial correlations ( i.e. , the assumption of using static pair - correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) ) is expected to become relatively less reliable at larger values of @xmath18 or @xmath6 .",

    "in summary , we have presented a study of the ground - state behavior of the symmetric e - e and e - h bilayers by including the effect of dynamic correlations within the qstls theory .",
    "we have found that the inclusion of the dynamical nature of correlations introduces quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the description of many - body properties as compared to static mean - field theories of the stls type .",
    "the qstls predictions for the intra- and interlayer pair - correlation functions and the ground - state energy are found to be in overall better agreement with the dmc results .",
    "the growing oscillatory trends in the dmc intralayer correlation function with increasing @xmath6 are accurately reproduced both in terms of amplitude and period for @xmath157 and @xmath158 - a feature that is missing in the stls results .",
    "however , the degree of agreement with the dmc data , specifically at small interparticle separation , becomes somewhat worse with increasing @xmath16 , at a given @xmath6 or @xmath7 , i.e. , in the strong coupling regime .",
    "another unique and important feature of the qstls theory is that , in both the e - h and e - e bilayers , it exhibits an instability towards a coupled wc ground state , below a critical density ( i.e. , for @xmath98 ) and in the close proximity of the layers .",
    "moreover , at high density ( for @xmath114 ) it indicates transition to a cdw ground state .",
    "thus , a crossover from the cdw instability to the wc instability takes place at @xmath159 .",
    "our prediction of wigner crystallization agrees qualitatively with the findings of the dmc calculations .",
    "however , the critical value of @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) is underestimated .",
    "this discrepancy in the estimate of @xmath83 seems to reflect the misrepresentation of short - range correlations at large @xmath18 or @xmath6 in the qstls theory .",
    "since the coulomb coupling among carriers grows with increasing @xmath18 or @xmath6 and the exchange correlations are relatively less important in the strong coupling regime , we believe that the failure of the qstls theory in such a regime arises from its neglect of the dynamics of the coulomb correlations , i.e. , of the coulomb correlation hole .",
    "another contribution to the failure is possibly due to the neglect of interaction effects on the momentum distribution function .",
    "these issues deserve further investigation .",
    "finally , we have also employed the qstls theory to examine the spin - polarization effects in the e - h bilayer .",
    "interestingly enough , a polarization transition is found to take place from the unpolarized to the polarized liquid ( at @xmath160 ) well before the unpolarized liquid could actually make transition to the wc ground state .",
    "the polarized e - h bilayer too supports the cdw and wc instabilities , but the crossover density is now lowered to @xmath139 .",
