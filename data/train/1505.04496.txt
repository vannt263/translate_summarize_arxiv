    "optical lithography is widely used to print circuit images onto substrates because of its inherent parallelism and the fact that its non - ionizing illumination avoids substrate damage . however , the resolution of traditional optical lithography is restricted by the rayleigh diffraction limit @xcite . due to this limit",
    ", we have to use shorter wavelengths such as extreme ultraviolet or x - ray to print smaller patterns @xcite .",
    "however , insulating materials such as silicon dioxide , when exposed to photons with energy greater than the band gap , release free electrons which subsequently can cause adverse charging which can lead to damage @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting and useful to invent an optical lithography scheme that can overcome the diffraction limit .    in the past two decades",
    ", a number of methods have been proposed including multiphoton absorption @xcite , quantum entanglement @xcite , dopperlon @xcite , and dark states @xcite .",
    "however , these methods either require higher order multiphoton absorption , higher order quantum entangled states or multi atomic levels to write patterns with higher order resolution . thus improving resolution more than ten times",
    "the optical wavelength with these methods is difficult in practice . in 2010",
    ", we proposed a novel scheme to overcome the diffraction limit in optical lithography by inducing rabi oscillations between two energy levels of the medium @xcite .",
    "the extension from lower resolution to higher resolution is straightforward where we just need to increase the power of the excitation laser or the interaction time .",
    "however , an effective way to print arbitrary one dimensional(1d ) and two dimensional ( 2d ) patterns with low background is difficult in this method .",
    "donut beam lithography @xcite , which is the inverse of the ground state depletion super - resolution ( gsd ) technique @xcite , can write arbitrary patterns with resolution beyond the diffraction limit , but it requires point - by - point scanning instead of full frame exposure and is very inefficient since most of the laser light is actually used to suppress resist exposure . using frequency - encoded light masks in neutral atom lithography it is possible to print arbitrary sub - diffraction - limited features @xcite . however , in atom lithography very high atom collimation is required for high resolution which is difficult to achieve with sufficient throughput to be useful for most lithography applications ..    in this paper , we propose an approach based on the mri super - resolution technique @xcite .",
    "our method can be conveniently called magnetic resonance lithography ( mrl ) @xcite .",
    "this method can be highly parallel , where the parallelism results from the fact that coherent excitation of two - level spin - flip transitions is employed . in this method ,",
    "the extension from lower resolution to higher resolution is also straightforward where we just need to apply larger magnetic gradient and narrower bandwidth of microwave .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to print arbitrary 1d and 2d patterns with low background .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the basic physics of mrl and propose the pulse sequence to print arbitrary 1d and 2d patterns . in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically demonstrate how to print an arbitrary one dimensional and two dimensional patterns into the spin states and the photoresist . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss some possible materials for mrl .",
    "finally , we summarize the results .",
    "mrl requires a paramagnetic system with high spin transition quality factors and high contrast optical readout of the spin state .",
    "in addition , to write an arbitrary 2d patterns the system should have three magnetic sublevels .",
    "the proposed schematic setup is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) where the paramagnetic system is imbeded near the surface of the substrate . we can create the magnetic gradient fields using conductive metal wires fabricated on the substrate surface by means of a conventional photolithography process .",
    "a static magnetic field @xmath0 is applied from the perpendicular direction to uniformly split the magnetic sublevels @xmath1 and @xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "a microwave pulse with special spectral components is also applied from the perpendicular direction to excite the spin transitions @xmath3 . after preparing the required pattern in the spin states",
    ", we may use a laser to excite the spins in state @xmath1 into a fluorescing excited state .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    to see how mrl can achieve high resolution , let us first consider how to write a narrow line in a spin pattern . if we apply a gradient magnetic field , the zeeman shift of the @xmath5 sublevels is a function of position . a narrowband microwave @xmath6 pulse is applied to excite the spins from @xmath1 to one of the @xmath5 sublevels . only spins with the proper zeeman shift are resonant with the microwave and the others are not appreciably excited .",
    "this is similar to the  resonant z - slice \" in mri @xcite .",
    "the absolute resolution limit of this technique is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spin transition linewidth and @xmath9 is the spatial gradient of zeeman shift .",
    "the width of the line is not limited by the wavelength but the spin transition linewidth and the gradient of the magnetic field . in principle",
    ", we can achieve arbitrary resolution by increasing the gradient of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , if the dephasing time is about 10@xmath10s @xcite and the gradient of the magnetic field is @xmath11 , the resolution can be a few nanometers .",
    "we can also address many spatial locations in parallel as in conventional mri where the narrowband microwave is replaced by a pulse with more complex spectral contents @xcite .",
    "for example , if we want to print an arbitrary 1d pattern characterized by @xmath12 whose value is normalized into 0 to 1 range , we should have excitation probability given by @xcite @xmath13\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the pulse duration and @xmath15 is the resonant part of the rabi frequency seen by atoms at the position @xmath16 . here , @xmath17 is the amplitude of the microwave frequency component which is resonant to the transition frequency @xmath18 at position @xmath16 , @xmath19 is the transition dipole moment between the two relevant energy levels , and @xmath20 is the plank constant .",
    "the transition frequency at position @xmath16 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the zero field splitting , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the magnetic field at position @xmath16 .",
    "the pulse in the time domain is the fourier transformation of the required spectrum which in turn is related to position because of the magnetic gradient .",
    "2d patterns can also be printed in this setup where all three energy sublevels are involved and both x and y magnetic gradients should be applied . the proposed pulse sequence is shown in fig .",
    "for example , we want to write a letter  t \" ( fig .",
    "1(d ) ) . first",
    ", all the spins are polarized to the state @xmath25 ( green down triangles ) . this is the initial state . to write column 1 ,",
    "the x - gradient magnetic field is turned on and a narrowband microwave @xmath6 pulse ( a ) , whose frequency is tuned to be resonant with spins in column 1 , rotates spins in this column from @xmath25 to @xmath26 state . then the x - gradient is turned off and the y - gradient is turned on and another microwave pulse(b ) with the desired spectrum rotates the spin in the first row from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( blue up triangles ) state . to write another column without crosstalk",
    ", we need to turn on the negative x - gradient magnetic field again ( and turn off the y - gradient ) and then apply the negative of pulse a to rotate unwanted spins ( red circle dots ) in column 1 back to the state @xmath25 ( green down triangles ) . finally , we again turn on the negative y - gradient ( with x - gradient off ) and the negative of pulse b is applied to rotate the spins in state @xmath27 back to state @xmath26 . a 1d pattern is then formed in the column 1 on the @xmath26 state .",
    "after that we can move to the next column and repeat the above procedures . as seen in the figure , the desired 2d pattern ",
    "t \" can then be encoded in the @xmath26 state .",
    "finally , an optical readout of the spin population can excite the spins in state @xmath1 into a fluorescing excited state .",

    "to capture the high resolution features of the patteren , the photoresist needs to be within the fret radius from the paramagnetic system .",
    "this could be achieved in several ways depending on the nature of the paramagnetic system .",
    "for example , for paramagnetic defects in crystals , this could be achieved by shallow implantation or engineered growth techniques . a more practical approach ,",

    "coherence times larger than a millisecond have been experimentally achieved for nvs leading to their frequent use as nanoscale magnetic field sensors @xcite .",
    "such properties could give mrl resolutions as high as a few nanometers .",
    "unfortunately at room temperature the optical readout of the nv spin state has less than @xmath53 contrast .",
    "nonetheless the inherent nonlinearity of resist exposure may allow us to produce high contrast patterns even with this relatively low optical contrast .",
    "one alternative candidate is the silicon vacancy ( siv ) center in diamond .",
    "the siv has an optical readout contrast near @xmath54 at low temperature since its ground state sublevel transitions can be optically resolved @xcite . unlike nv and many other materials , this high resolution persists even for ensembles , due to the low inhomogeneous broadening and low spectral diffusion of siv .",
    "granted that working at low temperature might produce some technical difficulties , nonetheless photoresist exposure has been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures @xcite .",
    "another important advantage of the siv is that it can have optical raman transitions connecting the ground state sublevels . here",
    "light shift gradients could also replace magnetic field gradients @xcite so that no wires would be needed on the substrate at all .",
    "finally we briefly consider other possible materials systems for performing mrl at room temperature .",
    "one of these is the st1 color center exhibiting a high optical readout contrast up to @xmath55 albeit with shorter spin lifetimes @xcite .",
    "ruby is also of interest as it has shown room temperature optical raman transitions with readout contrast comparable to nv@xcite .",
    "other alternatives are the rare - earth doped materials .",
    "for instance , super - resolution microscopy has been demonstrated using praseodymium - doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( pr : yag ) at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the upconversion uv emission of ( pr : yag ) is optimal for photoresist exposure .",
    "hence the prospects are good that a material suitable for room temperature mrl will eventually be identified .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an approach for optical lithography which is the inverse of magnetic resonance imaging .",
    "the technique uses atomic coherence in an ensemble of spin systems whose final state population can be optically detected .",
    "we design a pulse sequence which can write arbitrary 1d and 2d patterns into the spin states .",
    "we presented a numerical simulation to prove the fundamental physics of mrl which shows that our method here is capable of producing arbitrary 1d and 2d high - resolution patterns in one of the spin sublevels with high contrast .",
