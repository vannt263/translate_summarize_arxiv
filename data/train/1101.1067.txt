    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ legacy project , from molecular cores to planet forming disks ( c2d , @xcite ) has completed a survey of nearby star - forming regions .",
    "it covered five clouds , containing 1024 objects classified as young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite .",
    "when a dense core forms a central protostar , it develops a luminosity source from the accretion of infalling mass .",
    "the accretion luminosity is given as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the protostar , @xmath4 is the mass accretion rate onto the protostar , and @xmath5 is the radius of the protostar .",
    "according to the standard model , the mass accretion rate from spherical infall of the envelope is @xmath6 yr@xmath7 if the infall occurs at the thermal sound speed at 10 k @xcite . with a typical protostellar radius of 3 r@xmath8 , and a mass at the stellar / brown dwarf boundary of 0.08",
    ", the resulting @xmath9 is 1.6 .",
    "any luminosity from contraction of the forming star will add to this accretion luminosity , making it a minimum value in the standard model .",
    "in contrast to the predictions , the c2d survey showed that 59% of the 112 embedded protostars ( class 0/i ) have luminosity lower than 1.6  @xcite , indicating that either @xmath3 is very small , or @xmath4 is lower than expected , or both .",
    "this luminosity problem was aggravated by the discovery of very low luminosity objects ( vellos , @xcite ) .",
    "vellos are defined as embedded protostars with internal luminosity lower than 0.1 .",
    "the internal luminosity of an embedded protostar is the luminosity of the protostar and disk , excluding luminosity from external heating . by using the correlation between 70 @xmath10 flux and the internal luminosity of protostars , @xcite",
    "identify 15 vello candidates in the full c2d sample .",
    "several vellos including l1014-irs @xcite , l1148-irs @xcite , l1521f - irs @xcite , iram 04191-irs @xcite , l328-irs @xcite , and l673 - 7 @xcite , have been studied in detail . among those vellos ,",
    "iram 04191@xmath111522 and l673 - 7 drive strong molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "a low accretion luminosity with a significant molecular outflow can imply higher @xmath4 in the past @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the sources with low luminosities combined with strong molecular outflows is that the mass accretion is not a constant process but rather episodic , and the vellos are in quiescent phases between the mass accretion bursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a set of evolutionary models describing collapse including episodic accretion .",
    "the luminosity distribution of ysos can be matched only when the model includes episodic accretion .    while dust continuum emission can provide the physical structure and evolutionary stage of a core",
    ", molecular line observations trace the dynamics and chemistry of the core .",
    "the simple empirical models of step function @xcite and drop function abundance profiles have been used to approximate the abundance profiles .",
    "the chemical evolution model during protostellar collapse developed by @xcite has been tested for individual cores , like b335 @xcite , and l43 @xcite . using this model ,",
    "@xcite studied chemical evolution in vellos .",
