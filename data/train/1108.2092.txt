    "in many domains , convergence to a pure nash equilibrium is a fundamental problem . in many engineered agent - driven systems that fare",
    "best when steady at a pure nash equilibrium , convergence to equilibrium is expected@xcite to happen via _ better - response _ ( or _ best - response _ ) _ dynamics _ : start at some strategy profile .",
    "players take turns , in some arbitrary order , with each player making a better response ( best response ) to the strategies of the other players , i.e. , choosing a strategy that increases ( maximizes ) their utility , given the current strategies of the other players .",
    "repeat this process until no player wants to switch to a different strategy , at which point we reach a pure nash equilibrium .    for better - response dynamics to converge to a pure nash equilibrium regardless of the initial strategy profile , a _",
    "necessary _ condition is that , from every strategy profile , there exist _ some _ better - response improvement path ( that is , a sequence of players better responses ) leading from that strategy profile to a pure nash equilibrium . games for which this property holds are called `` weakly acyclic games ''  @xcite .",
    "both potential games  @xcite and dominance - solvable games  @xcite are special cases of weakly acyclic games .    in a game that is not weakly acyclic",
    ", there is at least one starting state from which the game is guaranteed to oscillate indefinitely under better-/best - response dynamics .",
    "moreover , the weak acyclicity of a game implies that natural decentralized dynamics ( e.g. , randomized better-/best - response , or no - regret dynamics ) are stochastically guaranteed to reach a pure nash equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "thus , weakly acyclic games capture the possibility of reaching pure nash equilibria via simple , local , globally - asynchronous interactions between strategic agents , independently of the starting state .",
    "we assert this is _ the _ realistic notion of `` convergence '' in most distributed systems .",
    "we now look at an example inspired by interdomain routing that has this natural form of convergence despite it being , formally , possible that the network will never converge . in keeping with results that we study here ,",
    "we consider best - response dynamics of a routing model in which each node can see each other node s current strategy , i.e. , its `` next hop '' ( the node to which it forwards its data en route to the destination ) , as contrasted with models where nodes depending on path announcements to learn this information .",
    "( levin et al .",
    "@xcite formalized routing dynamics in which nodes learn about forwarding through path announcements . )        consider the network on four nodes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wa - spp ] .",
    "each of the nodes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is trying to get a path for network traffic to the destination node @xmath3 .",
    "a strategy of a node @xmath4 is a choice of a neighbor to whom @xmath4 will forward traffic ; the strategy space of node @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is its neighborhood in the graph .",
    "the utility of the destination @xmath3 is independent of the outcome , and the utility @xmath6 of node @xmath7 depends only on the path that @xmath4 s traffic takes to the destination ( and is @xmath8 if there is no path ) .",
    "we only need to consider the relationships between the values of @xmath6 on all possible paths ; the actual values of the utilities do not make a difference . using @xmath9 to denote the path from @xmath0 to @xmath1 to @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and similarly for other paths , here",
    "we assume the following : @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 for all other paths @xmath14 , e.g. , @xmath15 .",
    "these preferences are indicated by the lists of paths in order of decreasing preference next to the nodes in fig .",
    "[ fig : wa - spp ] .    the unique pure nash equilibrium in the game in fig .",
    "[ fig : wa - spp ] is @xmath16 , and , ideally , the dynamics would always converge to it .",
    "however , there exists a best - response cycle in this game as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : br - cycle ] . here ,",
    "each triple lists the paths that nodes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 get ; the nodes strategies correspond to the second node in their respective paths .",
    "the node above the arrow between two triples is the one that makes a best response to get from one triple to the next .",
    "@xmath17    once the network is in one of these states , and @xmath3 temporarily fails .",
    "@xmath1 would always choose to send traffic to @xmath0 ( if anywhere ) ; @xmath0 would eventually converge to sending traffic directly to @xmath3 ( with @xmath1 sending its traffic to @xmath0 ) , and @xmath2 would then be able to send its traffic along @xmath18 .",
    "once the failed link between @xmath1 and @xmath3 is restored , @xmath1 s best response to the choices of the other nodes is to send its traffic directly to @xmath3 , resulting in the first configuration of the cycle above . ]",
    "there is a fair activation sequence ( i.e. , in which every node is activated infinitely often ) such that each activated node best responds to the then - current choices of the other nodes and such that the network never converges to a stable routing tree ( a pure nash equilibrium ) .",
    "although this cycle seems to suggest that the network in fig .",
    "[ fig : wa - spp ] would be operationally troublesome , it is not as problematic as we might fear . from every point in the state space , there is a sequence of best - response moves that leads to the unique pure nash equilibrium .",
    "we may see this by inspection in this case , but this example also satisfies the hypotheses of our main theorem below .",
    "so long as each node has some positive probability of being the next activated node , then , with probability @xmath0 , the network will eventually converge to the unique stable routing tree , regardless of the initial configuration of the network .",
    "weak acyclicity is connected to the study of the computational properties of _ sink equilibria _",
    "@xcite , minimal collections of states from which best - response dynamics can not escape : a game is weakly acyclic if and only if all sinks are `` singletons '' , that is , pure nash equilibria .",
    "unfortunately , mirrokni and skopalik  @xcite found that reliably checking weak acyclicity is extremely computationally intractable in the worst case ( pspace - complete ) even in succinctly - described games .",
    "this means , inter alia , that not only can we not hope to consistently check games in these categories for weak acyclicity , but we can not even hope to have general short `` proofs '' of weak acyclicity , which , once somehow found , could be tractably checked .    with little hope of finding robust , effective ways to consistently check weak acyclicity , we instead set out to find _ sufficient _ conditions for weak acyclicity : finding usable properties that imply weak acyclicity may yield better insights into at least _ some _ cases where we need weak acyclicity for the application .",
    "in this work , we focus on general normal - form games .",
    "potential games , the much better understood subcategory of weakly acyclic games , are known to have the following property , which we will refer to as _ subgame stability _",
    ", abbreviated @xmath19 : not only does a pure nash equilibrium exist in the game , but a pure nash equilibrium exists in each of its _ subgames _ , i.e. , in each game obtained from the original game by the removal of players strategies .",
    "subgame stability is a useful property in many contexts .",
    "for example , in network routing games , subgame stability corresponds to the important requirement that there be a stable routing state even in the presence of arbitrary network malfunctions  @xcite .",
    "we ask the following natural question : when is the strong property of subgame stability _",
    "sufficient _ for weak acyclicity ?",
    "yamamori and takahashi  @xcite prove the following two results :    * theorem:*@xcite _ in @xmath1-player games , subgame stability implies weak acyclicity , even under best response .",
    "_    * theorem:*@xcite _ there exist @xmath20 games for which subgame stability holds that are not weakly acyclic under best response .",
    "_    thus , subgame stability is sufficient for weak acyclicity in @xmath1-player games , yet is not always sufficient for weak acyclicity in games with @xmath21 players .",
    "our goal in this work is to ( 1 ) identify sufficient conditions for weak acyclicity in the general @xmath22-player case ; and ( 2 ) pursue a detailed characterization of the boundary between games for which subgame stability does imply weak acyclicity and games for which it does not .",
    "our main result for @xmath22-player games shows that a constraint stronger than @xmath19 , that we term `` _ _ unique subgame stability _ _ '' ( @xmath23 ) , is sufficient for weak acyclicity :    * theorem : * _ if every subgame of a game @xmath24 has a unique pure nash equilibrium then @xmath24 is weakly acyclic , even under best response .",
    "_    this result casts an interesting contrast against the negative result in @xcite : _ unique _ equilibria in subgames guarantee weak acyclicity , but the existence of _ more _ pure nash equilibria in subgames can lead to violations of weak acyclicity .",
    "hence , perhaps counter - intuitively , too many stable states can potentially result in persistent instability of local dynamics .",
    "( a similar phenomenon is seen in recent work of jaggard et al .",
    "@xcite , which studied settings in which multiple stable states preclude the possibility of a non - probabilistic guarantee of convergence . )",
    "we consider @xmath25 games , @xmath26 games , and also the class of _ strict and subgame stable _ games @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ , subgame stable games which have no ties in the utility functions .",
    "we observe that these three classes of games form the hierarchy @xmath28 .",
    "we examine the number of players , number of strategies , and the _ strictness _ of the game ( the constraint that there are no ties in the utility function ) , and give a complete characterization of the weak acyclicity implications of each of these .",

    "always in @xmath61 , there is never an incentive for anyone to unilaterally leave the cycle @xmath57 , forming a `` sheath '' of low - utility states separating @xmath57 from the rest of the game , particularly @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath57 is a persistent cycle . by construction ,",

    "if it has at least some states of @xmath57 , pick one state that is in @xmath62 , and follow the edges of @xmath57 until you get to a state whose sole outbound better - response move has been `` broken '' by the better - response strategy being removed in @xmath62 .",
    "this process will terminate , because @xmath57 is a simple cycle in @xmath24 that had at least one node missing in @xmath62 .",
    "the sole player that had an incentive to move in that state in @xmath24 now no longer has that option , and if he has any other strategy , the resulting state can not be in @xmath57 , because @xmath57 never uses more than 2 strategies of any player @xmath4 in combination with any fixed @xmath63 .",
    "thus , any other strategy is not an improvement for that player , either , and this new state is thus a pure nash equilibrium in @xmath62 .",
    "lastly , if @xmath62 contains neither @xmath58 nor any nodes of @xmath57 , taking the highest - index strategy for each player yields a profile that has to be a pure nash equilibrium , because the utilities of non-@xmath57 , non-@xmath58 profiles are just @xmath60 .",
    "thus , every subgame is guaranteed to have a pure nash equilibrium , and , due to @xmath57 , both games are not weakly acyclic .",
    "the theorem holds for games with more strategies by padding the examples given above .    with 4 or more players , a more mechanistic approach produces analogous examples",
    "even with just 2 strategies per player :    [ thm : counterex4p ] in a strict @xmath22-player game for an arbitrary @xmath64 , the existence of pure nash equilibria in every subgame is insufficient to guarantee weak acyclicity , even with only 2 strategies per player",
    ".    for strategy profiles in @xmath65 , using indices mod @xmath22 , set the utilities to : @xmath66 similarly to theorem [ thm : counterex3p ] , this plants a global pure nash equilibrium at @xmath67 , and creates a `` fragile '' better - response cycle .",
    "here , the cycle alternates between profiles with edit distance @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the global pure nash equilibrium . at every point of the cycle ,",
    "the only non - sheath profiles 1 step away are its predecessor and successor on the cycle , so the cycle is persistent . because each profile with edit distance @xmath68 from the equilibrium is covered , removing any player s 1 strategy breaks the cycle , thus guaranteeing a pure nash equilibrium in every subgame by the same reasoning as above .",
    "we note that the fixed - size examples that demonstrate the negative results above  in theorems [ thm : counterex - ss ] , [ thm : counterex3p ] , and [ thm : counterex4p]easily extend to games with extra strategies for some or all players , or with extra players , by `` padding '' the added part of the payoff table with negative , unique values that , for the added profiles , make payoffs independent of the other players , such as , e.g. , @xmath70 .",
    "this preserves @xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 properties without changing weak acyclicity .",
    "thus , this completes our classification of weak acyclicity under the three subgame - based properties , as shown in table [ table : summary ] .",
    "the connection between weak acyclicity and unique subgame stability that we present is surprising , but not immediately practicable : in most succinct game representations , there is no reason to believe that checking unique subgame stability will be tractable in many general settings . in a complexity - theoretic sense",
    ", @xmath26 is _ closer _ to tractability than weak acyclicity : any reasonable game representation will have some `` reasonable '' representation of subgames , i.e. , one in which _ checking _ whether a state is a pure nash equilibrium is tractable , which puts unique subgame stability in a substantially easier complexity class , @xmath71 , than the class pspace for which weak acyclicity is complete in many games .",
    "we leave open the important question of finding efficient algorithms for checking unique subgame stability , which may well be feasible in particular classes of games . also open and relevant , of course ,",
    "is the question of more broadly applicable and tractable conditions for weak acyclicity .",
