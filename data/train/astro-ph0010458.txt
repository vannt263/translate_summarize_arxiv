    "in a recent theoretical study of fe and @xmath11-process abundances in the early galaxy by wasserburg & qian ( 2000a ) , it was proposed that the first stars formed after the big bang were very massive ( @xmath0 ) and promptly enriched the interstellar medium ( ism ) to [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 , at which metallicity formation of regular stars ( with masses of @xmath12@xmath13 ) took over .",
    "subsequent fe enrichment was provided initially by a subset of type ii supernovae ( snii ) .",
    "the interpretations of wasserburg & qian ( 2000a ) were based on observations of metal - poor stars in the galaxy by gratton & sneden ( 1994 ) , mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , mcwilliam ( 1998 ) , and sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the critical metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 deduced by wasserburg & qian ( 2000a ) for transition from formation of very massive stars to regular stars is in remarkable coincidence with the lower bound of [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 observed in damped ly@xmath15 systems over a wide range in redshift ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , wasserburg & qian ( 2000b ) showed that the [ fe / h ] of damped ly@xmath15 systems can be explained in a straightforward manner by addition of fe from snii to the prompt inventory provided by the first very massive stars and that the evolution of [ fe / h ] with redshift reflects the chronology of turn - on of protogalaxies .",
    "the first very massive stars would certainly produce elements other than fe .",
    "one of the issues to be resolved is the general problem of the nucleosynthetic signatures of these stars .",
    "this problem was discussed in the early work by ezer & cameron ( 1971 ) .",
    "more recently , studies on condensation of big bang debris ( e.g. , bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ) indicated that protostellar aggregates of @xmath16 may be formed .",
    "evolution of zero - metallicity stars of @xmath0 was discussed by fryer , woosley , & heger ( 2000 ) .",
    "calculations by heger , woosley , & waters ( 2000 ) suggest that c , n , o , mg , si , and fe are produced in large amounts by these stars .",
    "the question is how the theoretical models of nucleosynthesis in the first very massive stars formed from big bang debris are related to the observations .",
    "another issue concerns the fe enrichment by type ia supernovae ( snia ) .",
    "it was assumed by wasserburg & qian ( 2000a , b ) that snia started to contribute fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath17 and were responsible for @xmath18 of the solar fe inventory . in a self - consistent fe enrichment model",
    ", the history of snia fe contribution needs to be examined more carefully based on observations .    in this paper",
    "we present a phenomenological model for the evolution of o abundance relative to fe .",
    "our approach differs from previous studies ( e.g. , timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ) in the following respects .",
    "previous studies rely on many inputs such as the nucleosynthetic yields predicted by various models of snii and snia and some description of star formation . in the approach here",
    "we attempt to identify a chemical evolution model that can account for the observed evolution of o abundance relative to fe in terms of several key parameters .",
    "we hope that this approach will give a simple yet complete interpretation of the data .",
    "the usual representation of the o and fe data is to display [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ] . in the approach here we use ( o / fe ) versus 1/(fe / h ) , with the round brackets indicating the number ratios .",
    "if there is only a single source with a fixed production ratio of o to fe beyond a certain point , the subsequent evolution of ( o / fe ) as a function of 1/(fe / h ) is along a straight line segment .",
    "as will be shown , this representation also facilitates a simple geometric means to describe the evolution of o and fe abundances in the general case . as the first very massive stars are thought to be a source of o and fe ( heger et al .",
    "2000 ) , the value of ( o / fe ) at [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 should serve as a nucleosynthetic signature of these stars , thus addressing the first issue raised above .",
    "subsequent to the prompt enrichment by the very massive stars , snii are essentially the only source of o , while fe enrichment was provided by snii initially and augmented by the contribution from snia only at a later time .",
    "thus the evolution of o abundance relative to fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath19 provides a means of addressing questions concerning the onset and nature of snia fe contribution .    based on the observations of metal - poor stars in the galaxy by israelian , garcia lopez , &",
    "rebolo ( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the value of ( o / fe ) resulting from the prompt production by the first very massive stars is @xmath7  ( o / fe)@xmath8 .",
    "comparison of our model with the same observations gives a history of snia fe contribution that is consistent with the results of previous studies ( e.g. , timmes et al . 1995 ) and with the assumptions of wasserburg & qian ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "the average production of o relative to fe for snii is found to be ( o / fe)@xmath20  ( o / fe)@xmath8 , which is @xmath21 times lower than that for the very massive stars . our model is presented in  2 and compared with observations in  3 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "for simplicity , we focus on the evolution of o and fe abundances in a closed system with a fixed mass . this mass can be stored in gas and stars .",
    "the initial state p at time @xmath22 contains gas only . at @xmath23 , the total mass of gas @xmath24 and that of stars @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 we ignore the return of o and fe to the gas by stars that are not related to snii or snia and consider that stars sample the composition of the gas at the time of their birth .",
    "thus the mass fraction @xmath27 of the element e in the gas is governed by @xmath28d\\,t ' , \\label{pxe}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the total rates for production of the element by snii and snia .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ pxe ] ) with respect to @xmath31 gives @xmath32 where equation ( [ mass ] ) has been used .",
    "equation ( [ dxe ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath33 note that the integrands in equation ( [ xe ] ) only depend on the production rates per unit mass of gas . as the mass fraction of h in the gas is nearly constant during its evolution , @xmath27 is proportional to the number ratio ( e / h ) .",
    "so equation ( [ xe ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath34 where ( e / h)@xmath35 is the inventory for the initial state p , and ( e / h)@xmath36 and ( e / h)@xmath37 represent the integral of the production rate per unit mass of gas over time for snii and snia .",
    "we consider that the first very massive stars ( with masses of @xmath38 ) formed from big bang debris provided an inventory of fe ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 ) and o. frequently we use `` prompt inventory '' or `` prompt production '' when referring to this inventory of fe and associated elements .",
    "it is considered that only very massive stars could form until this level of fe and associated elements was reached .",
    "the onset of formation of regular stars ( with masses of @xmath12@xmath13 ) corresponds to [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 .",
    "this defines the initial state p of the system .",
    "subsequently , snii that are related to the formation of regular massive stars ( with masses of @xmath39@xmath13 ) began to contribute o and fe .",
    "at a still later time ( see  3 ) , snia also began to contribute additional fe .",
    "it is considered ( e.g. , timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) that snia essentially produce no o. so we assume a production ratio ( o / fe)@xmath40 for snia .",
    "the o and fe yields may vary significantly between individual snii ( see  4 ) .",
    "however , the o or fe contribution from all snii may be lumped together so long as we are concerned with timescales of , e.g. , @xmath41  yr ( see  4 ) .",
    "furthermore , we will assume a constant average production ratio ( o / fe)@xmath36 for snii .",
    "the value of ( o / fe ) for the initial state p resulting from the prompt production by the first very massive stars is taken to be a constant ( o / fe)@xmath35 .",
    "thus ( o / fe)@xmath35 represents the production ratio for the prompt source , ( o / fe)@xmath36 for snii , and ( o / fe)@xmath40 for snia .",
    "the whole evolution of o and fe abundances can then be described by a three - component mixing model . in consideration of the time sequence indicated above",
    ", there is a domain where the model reduces to only two components , the prompt source and snii ( no snia ) . in this domain ,",
    "the number ratio of o to fe in the gas is @xmath42 where @xmath43",
    ". equation ( [ ofe ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath44 { { \\rm ( fe / h)}_{\\rm p}\\over{\\rm ( fe / h)}}. \\label{ofe2}\\ ] ] thus the ratio ( o / fe ) is a linear function of ( fe / h)@xmath35/(fe / h ) with a slope of [ ( o / fe)@xmath45",
    ". the evolution of ( o / fe ) in this regime would be along the line segment pii in figure 1 .",
    "point p is at ( o / fe )  =  ( o / fe)@xmath35 and ( fe / h)@xmath35/(fe / h )  =  1 , and represents the initial state p. point ii is at ( o / fe )  =  ( o / fe)@xmath36 and ( fe / h)@xmath35/(fe / h )  =  0 , and represents the result after an infinite number of snii ( eq . [ [ ofe2 ] ] ) . if snii cease to occur after contributing finite amounts of fe and o , then the end point for this part of the evolution would lie somewhere on the line segment pii .",
    "if the snii contributions were to cease and snia were to begin to contribute fe at the state corresponding to point a on the line segment pii in figure 1 , then the evolution of ( o / fe ) would again reduce to a two - component mixing model with one member being state a and the other being snia . in this simplified case ( no concurrent production by snii ) , the evolution of ( o / fe ) beyond point a would be along the line segment ai in figure 1 corresponding to @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the subscript `` a '' stands for quantities at point a. point i in figure 1 is at ( o / fe )  =  ( o / fe)@xmath40 and ( fe / h)@xmath35/(fe / h )  =  0 , and represents the result after an infinite number of snia ( eq . [ [ ofe1 ] ] ) .    as snii",
    "still occur after snia start to contribute fe at point a , the actual evolution of ( o / fe ) follows a curve between the line segments aii and ai in figure 1 .",
    "this is a three - component mixing regime involving state a , snii , and snia .",
    "an important parameter for this regime is the rate per unit mass of gas for fe production by snia relative to snii : @xmath48 for a constant @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 { { \\rm ( fe / h)}_{\\rm a}\\over{\\rm ( fe / h ) } } , \\label{ofec}\\ ] ] corresponding to the line segment ac in figure 1a .",

    "they attributed this source to the first very massive stars ( with masses of @xmath0 ) formed from big bang debris .",

    "the more frequent occurrence of sniih events with no fe production over a period of @xmath136  yr gives rise to the sharp increase in the ba abundance at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 .",

    "future measurements of ba abundances in these stars are needed to identify possible sniih contribution to the observed o abundances and to determine the prompt o inventory more accurately .",
    "however , from the above arguments based on the observations of hd 122563 and bd @xmath1465550 , we conclude that the origin of the o inventory at [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 must be assigned to the prompt source .    based on the assignment of ( o / fe)@xmath102  ( o / fe)@xmath8",
    ", the average production ratio of o to fe for the first very massive stars is @xmath156 by number [ ( o / fe)@xmath157 .",

    "it is necessary to take several effects into account .",
    "the universe at the epoch for formation of these stars was probably dominated by gas .",
    "we do not know how many very massive stars contributed to the prompt inventory .",

    "that is , many very massive stars are required to provide ( o / h)@xmath35 . clearly , further studies are needed to understand the formation , evolution , nucleosynthesis , and explosion of these stars .    to determine the relationship between ( o / fe ) and ( fe / h ) in the galaxy , israelian et al .",

    "there is some disagreement between different workers on the evolution of o abundance relative to fe , in part due to the choice of spectral lines used to determine the o abundance ( e.g. , barbuy 1988 ) .",
    "while the general model developed here must stand on its own , the numerical value of ( o / fe)@xmath35 for the prompt inventory is dependent on the observational results of israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "up to this point , we have assumed that the ism consists of gas only and that the abundances in an individual star are representative of the average gas at the birth of the star .",
    "in fact , the galactic ism consists of both gas and dust , with dust making up @xmath165 of the total mass at present .",
    "certain elements such as fe in the ism are greatly depleted in the gas phase and are considered to be condensed into dust .",
    "so long as stars sample the composition of the bulk ism including both gas and dust , we can still interpret stellar observations in terms of galactic chemical evolution as done here because dust is converted into gas in stars .",
    "in contrast , when applying the model developed here to damped ly@xmath15 systems , it must be further assumed that fe and o are not substantially fractionated relative to each other in the protogalactic ism of such systems .",
    "if for example , fe were dominantly in dust and o in gas in the ism of damped ly@xmath15 systems ( as is the case in many galaxies of about the present epoch ) , then a straightforward application of the model to such systems would give completely misleading interpretation of the data , which only sample elements in the gas phase .",
    "the most accurate measurement of o abundance in a damped ly@xmath15 system so far was reported by molaro et al .",
    "they gave [ o / h ]  @xmath166 corresponding to [ o / fe ]  @xmath167 for a damped ly@xmath15 system with [ fe / h ]  @xmath168 at a redshift @xmath169 .",
    "these data do not fit the trend exhibited by the galactic data shown in figure 2d .",

    "substantial efforts have been made to establish the dust - to - gas ratio for damped ly@xmath15 systems at redshifts @xmath170 .",
    "estimates have been made for the possible dust depletion of condensible elements ( e.g. , si , cr , and fe ) relative to more volatile ones ( e.g. , zn ) that are considered to remain in the gas phase .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have argued that there is some significant dust depletion of condensible elements ( by a factor of @xmath104 ) in the damped ly@xmath15 systems at very early epochs . however , there is strong disagreement between various workers ( e.g. , lu et al . 1996 ; prochaska & wolfe 2000 ) regarding the degree of dust depletion in these systems .",
    "wasserburg & qian ( 2000b ) assumed that dust depletion is not a dominant effect on the chemical evolution of damped ly@xmath15 systems at @xmath170 .",
    "there is clear evidence for large amounts of dust in a variety of galaxies at high @xmath171 .",
    "we can not reconcile the assumption of low dust - to - gas ratios for damped ly@xmath15 systems with these observations .",
    "the cause of the transition to the high dust content for galaxies of about the present epoch is not understood unless the later dust contribution of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars plays a major role .",
    "it is expected that the first very massive stars formed from big bang debris produce c / o ratios of @xmath9 ( heger et al .",

    "this would prevent the formation of c grains and also the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) as well as other hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "a strict upper limit to the dust content of the ism at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 can be estimated by taking the total abundance of the major condensible elements mg , si , and fe to be @xmath39 times the fe abundance ( see below ) . as no c dust should be formed , dust would constitute at most @xmath172 of the total mass of the ism at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 . for a typical dust size @xmath173 , the obscuration due to this presence of dust is at most at the level of @xmath174 $ ] in a system of neutral h column density @xmath175 .    by attributing the o inventory at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 to the prompt production by the first very massive stars formed from big bang debris ,",
    "the model presented here also predicts that the mg and si abundances in stars with ( o / fe )  @xmath176  ( o / fe)@xmath35 and [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 should to a large extent reflect the prompt inventory of mg and si .",
