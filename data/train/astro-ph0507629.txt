    "the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic observations of detached eclipsing binary stars ( debs ) is one of the most powerful ways to investigate the properties of single stars ( andersen 1991 ) .",
    "the analysis of good light curves and radial velocity curves allows the measurement of the absolute masses and radii of two stars to an accuracy of 1% or better , and surface gravities to within 0.01dex ( e.g. , southworth , maxted & smalley 2004b ) .",
    "further analysis using spectral synthesis or photometric index calibrations also allows the derivation of accurate effective temperatures and therefore luminosities of the components of the eclipsing system .",
    "accurate dimensions of a deb provide a way of testing theoretical stellar evolutionary models because the two components of the system have the same age and chemical composition but , in general , different masses and radii .",
    "the observation and analysis of debs in stellar clusters and associations may also allow the calculation of accurate dimensions of four or more stars of the same age and initial chemical composition . in this case",
    "the distance to the cluster can be found using empirical methods which are free of the difficulties of the main - sequence fitting technique ( southworth , maxted & smalley 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , the age , metallicity and helium abundance of the cluster as a whole can be found from comparison of the observed masses and radii of the deb with theoretical stellar models ( southworth , maxted & smalley 2004a ) .",
    "another use of debs is to investigate the physical processes at work in single stars .",
    "this is particularly useful if one or both components belongs to a class of peculiar or poorly understood stars , for example slowly pulsating bstars ( e.g. , v539arae ; clausen 1996 ) , or metallic - lined stars ( e.g. , kwhydrae ; andersen & vaz 1984 , 1987 ) .",
    "metallic - lined a stars ( am stars ) are well represented in the compilation of accurate eclipsing binary data by andersen ( 1991 ) , but many details of why and how these stars form and evolve are still not well understood .",
    "am stars have spectral types between late - b and early - f , and exhibit peculiar photospheric chemical abundances .",
    "whilst the calcium and scandium spectral lines are abnormally weak , the lines due to other metals can be strongly enhanced .",
    "this phenomenon is observed to be common for a stars with rotational velocities below about 100kms@xmath11  ( abt & morrell 1995 ) , and is caused by the diffusion of chemical species below the surfaces of the stars ( budaj 1996 , 1997 ; michaud et al .",
    "2004 ; turcotte et al .",
    "am stars often occur in binary systems ( e.g. , abt 1961 ) , which is expected as tidal effects in close binaries generally cause the rotational velocities of the stars to be slower than those of single stars .",
    "whilst there have been suggestions that am stars have slightly larger radii than other a - type stars ( kitamura & kondo 1978 ; budaj 1996 ) , this has not been confirmed by recent studies of metallic - lined debs ( lacy et al .",
    "2002 , 2004a ; lacy , claret & sabby 2004b ) . the masses , radii and luminosities of metallic - lined components of debs are generally well matched by the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models for normal stars .",

    "+    we compared the masses and radii of the components of wwaur to predictions of the granada ( claret 1995 ) , geneva ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , padova ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) and cambridge ( pols et al .",
    "1998 ) theoretical stellar evolutionary models , but were unable to find a match for any of the published chemical compositions under the assumption that the stars have the same age and chemical composition .",
    "we also compared the properties of wwaur to the theoretical models of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to investigate whether one or both of the stars may be in a pre - main - sequence phase , but we remained unable to find a match to the observations .",
    "further investigation using the models of claret ( 2004 ) revealed that an acceptable match to the masses and radii of wwaur could be obtained for a very high metal abundance of @xmath12 and an age between 77 and 107myr .",
    "models were calculated for the observed masses of the stars , and a helium abundance of @xmath13 was adopted from the standard chemical enrichment law with @xmath14 .",
    "the effective temperatures of the stars are in agreement with the model predictions for this chemical composition and age , although this is of low significance because they are quite uncertain .",
    "it is possible to match the properties of the stars using models with fractional metal abundances between about 0.055 and 0.065 .",
    "an acceptable match to the observed properties of wwaur can also be found for an age of about 1myr and an approximately solar chemical composition , but the age range over which the match is acceptable is extremely small .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelfit ] .",
    "we have investigated whether a lower chemical composition could be found by varying the input physics of the claret ( 2004 ) models , which use nuclear reactions rates from nacre .",
    "we have performed tests with the new measurement of the nuclear rate @xmath15n(@xmath16)@xmath17o ( runkle 2003 ; formicola et al .",
    "2004 ) which is around a factor two smaller than the previous one ( schrder et al .",
    "the differences are not noticeable for stars with masses similar to those of wwaur .",
    "the influence of convective core overshooting was also investigated : for no extra mixing ( @xmath18 ) we obtain slightly smaller ages but a very similar metal abundance .",
    "the effects of rotation were also considered ( claret 1999 ) : for solid body rotation and local conservation of the angular momentum , no conspicuous differences were found when compared with standard models .",
    "we conclude that the high metal abundance required to match the physical properties of wwaur can not be attributed to differences among the evolutionary codes or the input physics .",
    "in fact , recent comparisons between the available grids of stellar models ( lastennet & valls - gabaud 2002 ; southworth et al .",
    "2004b ) indicate that the models from geneva , padova and granada are very similar when compared with observations of debs .",
    "the component stars of wwaur are peculiar , both because of their metallic - lined nature and because current theoretical evolutionary models can only match their masses and radii for a high metal abundance of @xmath19 .",
    "the strong metal lines in their spectra are due to the am phenomenon , and not a high overall metal abundance , because the calcium and scandium lines are weak .",
    "we must now ask whether the am phenomenon is just a surface phenomenon , or whether it is affecting the radii of the two stars and causing us to find a spurious large metal abundance .",
    "this question can be answered by considering other well - studied metallic - lined debs and by investigating whether the diffusion of chemical species can significantly affect the radii of a stars predicted by theoretical models .",
    "several debs containing am stars have recently been studied : v885cyg ( lacy et al .",
    "2004a ) , v459cas ( lacy et al .",
    "2004b ) , wwcam ( lacy et al .  2002 ) and v364lac ( torres et al .",
    "the components of v885cyg and wwcam are clearly metallic - lined but the presence of chemical peculiarity in v459cas and v364lac is uncertain .",
    "the theoretical models of claret ( 2004 ) can match the properties of v885cyg and wwcam for metal abundances of 0.030 and 0.020 , respectively .",
    "the same models can also match v459cas with @xmath20 and v364lac with @xmath21 .",
    "as these debs can be matched by models with normal chemical compositions , we have no reason to suppose that the am phenomenon makes a significant difference to the radii of stars ( see southworth et al .",
    "2004d for further discussion ) .",
    "the metallic - lined deb kwhya was analysed by andersen & vaz ( 1984 , 1987 ) , who found an unusual chemical composition from comparison with the models of hejlesen ( 1980 ) .",
    "however , the hejlesen models use old opacity data which is quite different from recent results , so any chemical composition derived using them needs revision .",
    "theoretical models for a stars with diffusion have been published by richer , michaud & turcotte ( 2000 ) .",
    "the am phenomenon is found to be important only near the surfaces of a stars , so only affects surface quantities such as effective temperature ( s.  turcotte , 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "it will therefore have a negligible effect on the stellar radius .",
    "in particular , for wwaur to match theoretical models of a normal chemical composition , the _ ratio _ of the radii of the two stars must become significantly smaller .",
    "any physical phenomenon must therefore affect one component far more than the other component .",
    "we have found no evidence that the am phenomenon is causing us to find a high metal abundance for wwaur , so we will now consider the existence of stars which are very rich in metals .",
    "the highest recent estimation of the metal abundance of a deb is @xmath22 ( ewori , popper et al .",
    "1986 ) by ribas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , from a comparison with ( extrapolated ) predictions from the claret ( 1995 ) theoretical models .",
    "a metal abundance of @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath23}}= + 0.5 $ ] , is at least three times higher than the accepted solar abundance ( but see asplund , grevasse & sauval 2004 ) .",
    "however , the metal abundance of the old open cluster ngc6253 has been found to be between @xmath24 and 0.06 ( twarog , anthony - twarog & de lee 2003 ) .",
    "these authors found metallicities between @xmath23}}= 0.4 $ ] and 0.9 from the strmgren @xmath25 and calcium @xmath26 photometric indices of stars in ngc6253 , although the best isochronal match to the morphology of its colour - magnitude diagram was obtained using the padova stellar evolutionary models for @xmath24 and enhanced abundances of the @xmath27-elements .",
    "therefore , whilst high metal abundances of @xmath12 are unusual , there is no reason to assume that they do not exist .",
    "we have studied the metallic - lined a - type deb wwaurigae in order to determine its physical properties .",
    "the masses have been derived to accuracies of 0.4% by cross - correlating the observed spectra against standard star spectra .",
    "the radii have been derived to accuracies of 0.6% by analysing @xmath4 and @xmath3 light curves with the ebop code .",
    "the masses and radii have been found without using any theoretical calculations so can be regarded as being entirely empirical .",
    "they are also among the most accurately known for any stars .",
    "the effective temperatures of the two stars have been derived from their hipparcos parallax , using a method which is nearly fundamental .",
    "attempts to find a good match between the physical properties of wwaur and predictions from several sets of theoretical stellar evolutionary models were unsuccessful for any of the chemical compositions for which models are available .",
    "pre - main sequence evolutionary predictions were equally unsuccessful .",
    "however , the predictions of the claret ( 2004 ) models match the observed masses , radii and effective temperatures for a metal abundance of @xmath12 and for an age of roughly 90myr .",
    "this conclusion is robust against changes in the input physics of the models .",
    "the tidal evolution theory of zahn predicts timescales for orbital circularisation and rotational synchronisation which are much longer than the age of wwaur , in disagreement with the observed circular orbit and the synchronous rotation of the stars .",
    "similar cases can be found in southworth et al ( 2004a ) and gonzlez & lapasset ( 2002 ) .",
    "the tassoul theory gives much shorter tidal evolution timescales and correctly predicts synchronous rotation , but predicts that the orbit should not yet be circularised .",
    "however , this could be easily explained by tidal evolution in the pre - main sequence phase ( zahn & bouchet 1989 ) or the formation of a system with a nearly circular orbit ( tohline 2002 ) .    we have found no evidence to suggest that the am phenomenon is causing us to derive a spurious metal abundance for wwaur .",
    "in fact , the claret ( 2004 ) theoretical evolutionary models can match the observed properties of other am debs for entirely normal chemical compositions .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of stellar models which include diffusion , which suggest that its presence does not significantly affect the radii of a stars .",
    "our conclusion that wwaur is rich in metals relies on our measurements of the masses and radii of the two stars and the use of theoretical models to determine what initial chemical compositions could produce these properties , so is reliable .",
    "further investigation of this will require more accurate effective temperatures , which may be available in the near future .",
    "a final analysis of the astrometric data from the hipparcos satellite will soon be available , which is expected to report a significantly more accurate parallax for this deb ( f.  van leeuwen , 2004 , private communication ; van leeuwen & fantino 2005 ) .",
    "wwaur will also be a target for the astra robotic spectrophotometer ( adelman et al .",
    "2004 ) , which aims to observe accurate spectrophotometric fluxes for the measurement of fundamental effective temperatures of many types of stars .",
    "a rediscussion of the effective temperatures of wwaur compared to theoretical predictions may then allow chemical composition of the system to be studied in more detail .",
    "many thanks are due to bill morris for technical help with retrieving electronic versions of the @xmath3 light curves from a nine - track tape .",
    "thanks are also due to jens viggo clausen for analysing the @xmath28 light curve of wwaur with wink .",
    "we would also like to thank jens viggo clausen , sylvain turcotte , johannes andersen , jrgen christensen - dalsgaard and many others for discussions .",

    "<S> wwaurigae is a detached eclipsing binary composed of two metallic - lined a - type stars orbiting each other every 2.5 days . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the masses and radii of both components to accuracies of 0.4% and 0.6% , respectively . from a cross - correlation analysis of high - resolution spectra </S>",
    "<S> we find masses of @xmath0@xmath1  for the primary star and @xmath2@xmath1  for the secondary star . from an analysis of photoelectric @xmath3 and @xmath4 light curves we find the radii of the stars to be @xmath5@xmath6  and @xmath7@xmath6 , where the uncertainties have been calculated using a monte carlo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> fundamental effective temperatures of the two stars have been derived , using the hipparcos parallax of wwaur and published ultraviolet , optical and infrared fluxes , and are @xmath8 and @xmath9k . </S>",
    "<S> the masses , radii and effective temperatures of wwaur are only matched by theoretical evolutionary models for a fractional initial metal abundance , @xmath10 , of approximately 0.06 and an age of roughly 90myr . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be the highest metal abundance inferred for a well - studied detached eclipsing binary , but we find no evidence that it is related to the metallic - lined nature of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the circular orbit of wwaur is in conflict with the circularization timescales of both the tassoul and the zahn tidal theories and we suggest that this is due to pre - main - sequence evolution or the presence of a circular orbit when the stars were formed .    stars : binaries : eclipsing  stars : fundamental parameters  stars : binaries : spectroscopic  stars : early - type  stars : chemically peculiar </S>"
