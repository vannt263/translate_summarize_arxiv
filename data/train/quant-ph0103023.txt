    "the resource of entanglement @xcite has many useful applications in quantum information processing , such as secret key distribution @xcite , teleportation @xcite and dense coding @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an intense interest in the physical implementation of these quantum communication protocols @xcite . in the future , it is conceivable that a large number of distant users would want to engage in communicating with each other through quantum protocols for purposes of security @xcite , doubled capacity @xcite , high fidelity state transfer ( by teleportation @xcite ) , reduced communication complexity @xcite , secret sharing @xcite , linking distant quantum computers @xcite , for distributed computation @xcite and a host of other applications @xcite . for this to happen , any pair or group of distant users will need to share particles in any desired pure entangled state , irrespective of noise in the entanglement distribution channels . in this context , various general schemes which could directly or indirectly aid in the distribution of entanglement have been theoretically studied @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "one of these schemes , suggested by briegel _",
    "et al . _ and dr _ et al .",
    "_ , is the idea of _ quantum repeaters _",
    "@xcite . in their scheme",
    ", a number of nodes called repeaters are placed between the ends of a noisy channel .",
    "the entanglement is first distributed between neighboring nodes and concentrated by local actions @xcite at these nodes to produce a few highly entangled pairs .",
    "then entanglement swapping @xcite is used to connect the highly entangled pairs in series to obtain some highly entangled pairs between the ends of the noisy channel . in this way",
    ", the exponential degradation of entanglement with channel length can be prevented at the expense of only a logarithmic increase in resources ( cost ) and a polynomial increase in time @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will look at the use of repeaters from a rather different angle .",
    "we will show that if the amount of entanglement finally required between two ends of a noisy channel was fixed , it could be achieved , in certain circumstances , at a much lower cost using quantum repeaters .",
    "consider the following scenario .",
    "you are given @xmath0 boxes labeled @xmath1,@xmath2, ...",
    ",@xmath0 , each of which can be made to emit exactly one maximally entangled particle pair on demand .",
    "your target is to distribute entanglement between two ends @xmath3 and @xmath4 of a noisy channel .",
    "you have complete freedom of placing the boxes anywhere along the length of the channel prior to distribution .",
    "suppose you first place all the @xmath0 sources at the midpoint of the channel as shown in fig.[fig1a ] and then make them emit maximally entangled pairs .",
    "the pairs will lose part of their initial entanglement while traveling from the middle to the end of the channel . at the end of this process",
    ", a certain amount of entanglement is obtained between the ends @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the channel .",
    "you are then asked whether it is possible to devise a more effective scheme in which you distribute the _ same amount of entanglement between a and b using a lower number of initial sources of maximally entangled pairs_. it turns out , as we will show , that the scheme shown in fig.[fig1b ] can accomplish this in certain circumstances ( _ i.e. _ for certain lengths and types of the noisy channels ) .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the channel into two equal segments and place a repeater station at the midpoint of the channel .",
    "a lower number @xmath5 of sources may now be sufficient to distribute as much entanglement between @xmath3 and @xmath4 as before .",
    "we first have to place @xmath6 sources at the midpoint of each half - channel .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig1b ] with boxes @xmath1,@xmath7, ... ,@xmath8 having been placed at the midpoint of the left half - channel and boxes @xmath2,@xmath9, ... ,@xmath5 placed at the midpoint of the other half - channel , where @xmath10",
    ". then they are made to emit maximally entangled pairs which are stopped at @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the repeater station . after traversing a certain distance ,",
    "each of the pairs would have lost part of their entanglement .",
    "an operator at the repeater station has to now act together with operators at @xmath3 and @xmath4 to locally distill two sets of maximally entangled pairs @xcite : one set between the repeater and @xmath3 , and the other set between the repeater and @xmath4 .",
    "the operator at the repeater then connects these maximally entangled pairs by entanglement swapping @xcite to obtain a set of maximally entangled states between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "though the maximum number of possible ( entangled or disentangled ) particle pairs between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is @xmath11 in the case of distribution with a repeater , the degradation of entanglement of each pair is also less ( as each particle now travels half the distance as before ) .",
    "the scheme with a repeaters saves resources when the positive effect of lower entanglement loss on traversal of the channel overrides the negative effect of having a lower number of entanglement sources to start with .",
    "the resource reduction process described above , as we shall demonstrate , can be made more significant for certain channel lengths by dividing the channel into an even larger number of segments and placing repeater stations at the junctions of these segments . this would lead to an important _ cost reduction _ in the distribution of entanglement .",
    "the cost of distributing entanglement will become a very important issue in the future if quantum communications take off and this topic has already received serious attention ( see , for example , cirac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cost reduction to be approximately proportional to reduction of the initial resource of entanglement ( in terms of the number of sources of maximally entangled pairs used ) .",
    "we neglect , for example , the cost of classical communication during the entanglement distillation procedures ( though this cost might not necessarily increase on using repeaters , as the number of pairs distilled in parallel is also decreased ) .",
    "this assumption seems reasonable , as entanglement is , generally , the most expensive of all relevant resources , while classical communications can be accomplished through a conventional telephone line .",
    "our investigation differs in two distinct ways from the investigations in the original proposal for quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "firstly , the focus is shifted from reliable distribution of entanglement to resource reduction .",
    "while in @xcite it was shown that one could use repeaters to prevent the exponential degradation of entanglement with only logarithmic increase in cost , we show that the cost of distributing a certain fixed amount of entanglement between two ends of a channel can be reduced using repeaters .",
    "secondly , we will take a general approach based on known values and bounds on distillable entanglement @xcite and conjectured bounds @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our analysis will remain valid even if improved ( or even optimal ) entanglement distillation schemes are found and even if the future advance of technology results in completely error free quantum operations .",
    "we should mention here that for those particular cases for which we use known conjectures , rather than proven results , our results may not continue to hold true if the conjecture is shown invalid",
    ". however , exactly the same methodology as ours can still be used to investigate resource reduction via repeaters using any accepted nonzero lower bounds on distillable entanglement .",
    "we should also mention that we consider only asymptotic distillation procedures , primarily because of they give simple entropic expressions for entanglement .",
    "this , of course , provides a restriction to the amount by which resources can be reduced while still keeping our analysis valid .",
    "we would require asymptotic distillation results to remain valid even for the sets of entangled pairs being distilled between two adjacent repeaters or a repeater and an end of the channel .",
    "this lower number of entangled pairs must thus , already , be very large .",
    "so we would want the resource reduction to be not so much as to make some of the distillation procedures nonasymptotic .",
    "for this reason , we will calculate resource reduction as a ratio instead of as a difference and it will remain valid as long as the initial number @xmath0 of sources is so large , that even during the reduced resource operation with repeaters , all the asymptotic results remain applicable .    in the next section",
    "we proceed to investigate resource reduction by repeaters for those channels which result in states whose distillable entanglement is exactly known .",
    "we will start with the watched amplitude damping channel , as the output states of this channel are pure and we can readily use the known asymptotic distillation results for pure states @xcite .",
    "the amplitude damping channel has the following effect on states @xmath12 and @xmath13 of a qubit @xcite :    @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a parameter that is related to the length of the channel by @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is a quantity proportional to the length of the channel and the subscript @xmath18 stands for the environmental state . the expression for @xmath15 above has been so chosen that at infinite length of the channel , the state of the system becomes @xmath19 .",
    "when the environment is being watched , and found to be in the state @xmath20 , we can consider the evolution of the state to be given by @xcite    @xmath21 and this occurs for a state @xmath22 with the probability @xmath23 we consider each state separately , because the second requires purification after passing down a watched amplitude damping channel , but the first does not .",
    "initially , consider sending a state @xmath25 down the channel with @xmath0 sources of entangled qubits at the precise midpoint of the channel as shown below :    ( 200,100)(-100,-50 ) ( -90,0)(70,0)70 ( 20,0)(70,0)70 ( -100,0)2 ( 95,0)1 ( -90,0 ) ( 90,0)(-17.5,8)@xmath26 ( -14,-2.5)source    in the above diagram , let @xmath1 and @xmath2 symbolize two qubits from one of the sources reaching opposite ends of the channel .",
    "if both the qubits pass through an amplitude damping channel on their way to the ends of the channel , the final state of the qubits and their environment is :    @xmath27_{e_1e_2 } ) { \\end{array}}\\ ] ] if the environment is being watched then there is probability @xmath28 that the resulting state is unchanged and maximally entangled , and @xmath29 that it is a ( useless ) product state .",
    "in this way we will end up with @xmath30 surviving entangled pairs , where the subscript @xmath31 has been used to indicate that the channel has no repeaters ( is undivided ) .",
    "consider now splitting the channel into two and placing half of the sources at the midpoint of one half and the rest half of the sources in the midpoint of the other half in the following manner :    ( 200,100)(-100,-50 ) ( -90,0)(35,0)35 ( -40,0)(35,0)35 ( 5,0)(35,0)35 ( 55,0)(35,0)35    ( -100,5)3 ( -10,5)4 ( 5,5)2 ( 95,5)1 ( -90,0 ) ( 90,0 ) ( 5,0 ) ( -5,0 ) ( -65,9.5)@xmath32(30,9.5)@xmath32 ( -55,-2.5)src ( 40,-2.5)src    in the above diagram , let @xmath1 and @xmath2 stand for the qubits from any one of the sources reaching the ends of the right half - channel and @xmath7 and @xmath9 stand for similar qubits reaching the ends of the left half - channel . the place where @xmath2 and @xmath9 meet , namely the midpoint of the full - channel , is the site of a quantum repeater . if we kept the total number @xmath0 of sources of entangled pairs fixed , but still large , then @xmath33 pairs are now used for each half - channel .",
    "for each half , we now have @xmath34 .",
    "this means the number of maximally entangled pairs available finally in each half is the product of @xmath33 multiplied by the probability @xmath35 of getting a maximally entangled state _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath36 . let particle pairs @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the above diagram now be taken to symbolize any two of the several maximally entangled pairs obtained in the half - channels . if joint projections are now performed on particles 2 and 4 by an operator at the repeater , a maximally entangled pair is obtained across the full channel .",
    "the number of maximally entangled pairs obtained finally across the whole channel is thus equal to the number of maximally entangled pairs obtained in each half - channel prior to the joint projections on @xmath2 and @xmath9 at the repeater .",
    "it is therefore equal to @xmath39 where the subscript @xmath1 denotes the fact that one repeater is now being used .",
    "so , whilst the exponent of @xmath40 is smaller compared to that of @xmath41 , there is an extra factor of @xmath42 in front of @xmath40 compared to @xmath41 .",
    "so is @xmath41 larger or smaller than @xmath40 ?",
    "fig.[fig : figa ] plots @xmath41 and @xmath40 as functions of @xmath17 .",
    "this shows that after a certain value of @xmath17 , it is better ( in terms of obtaining higher final entanglement ) to split the full - channel to two half - channels with a repeater in the middle .",
    "this idea can be generalized to splitting the channel into @xmath43 sections .",
    "eq.([eq : eqnb ] ) can then be generalized to : @xmath44 in each case , after a certain value of @xmath17 , it becomes better to use 3 rather than 2 or 4 rather than 3 etc .",
    "sections of the channel in order to obtain maximum entanglement .",
    "we now show how this idea can be used to achieve a resource reduction in entanglement distribution via repeaters ( _ i.e. _ , via splitting of a channel into several segments ) . we will show that we will need a smaller number of sources of entangled pairs to obtain the same amount of final entanglement across two ends of the channel .",
    "consider relabeling @xmath0 in eq.([eq : watchm ] ) to @xmath45 and setting that expression equal to @xmath41 .",
    "this condition demands that with @xmath46 repeaters and @xmath5 sources of entanglement we produce the same number of maximally entangled pairs finally across the channel as the undivided channel with @xmath0 sources placed in the middle .",
    "we can then compare the ratio @xmath47 , that is , the ratio of input pairs ( sources ) required for the undivided channel to the number of input pairs ( sources ) required for the channel with repeater stations .",
    "let us label this ratio @xmath48 .",
    "then we have @xmath49 when @xmath48 is greater than one , it means the channel with repeaters needs fewer input pairs ( sources ) i.e. less resources .",
    "graph [ fig : b ] plots @xmath48 versus @xmath43 - the number of sections in a channel with repeaters , for a fixed value of @xmath50 . at @xmath51 sections ( or two repeaters ) , the resource reduction over the undivided channel is highest .",
    "two repeaters is thus the the optimal way to distribute entanglement for @xmath50 . in this case , using just @xmath52th of the amount of initial resources , we achieve the same output of entanglement as an undivided channel .",
    "fig.[fig : w3d ] is a plot in 3d , extending fig [ fig : b ] over a range of @xmath17 to show the variation of the optimal number of divisions of the channel with @xmath17 .",
    "we see that as @xmath17 ( which is proportional to the channel length ) increases , it becomes more and more advantageous in terms of resource reduction to use repeaters .",
    "we now consider sending two qubits in the initial state @xmath53 down an amplitude - damped channel .",
    "the resulting state is :    @xmath54_{12 } { \\left| 00 \\right\\rangle } _ { e_1e_2 } \\\\ & + & e^{-\\gamma}\\sqrt{1-e^{-2\\gamma } } { \\left| 01 \\right\\rangle } _ { 12 } { \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle } _ { e_1e_2 } \\    \\\\",

    "@xmath59 is not maximally entangled and must now be purified . when a large number of pure states like these are distilled , the number of maximally entangled states that can be produced is given by @xmath60 @xcite , where @xmath61 is the reduced density matrix of any one of the qubits and @xmath62 is the von - neumann entropy given by @xmath63 .",
    "if we began with an undivided channel and @xmath0 pairs were dispatched from @xmath0 sources , all placed at the midpoint , then @xmath64 reach opposite ends of the channel in the state @xmath59 and rest reach the ends disentangled .",
    "one can locally purify these states to obtain    @xmath65 maximally entangled pairs between the two ends of the channel .",
    "now consider splitting this channel into two halves as before . at the midpoint of each half we place @xmath33 sources and make them emit maximally",
    "entangled pairs .",
    "the probability that an entangled state arrives at the ends of a half - channel is @xmath66 .",
    "each half then purifies its pairs ( independently of the other half ) .",
    "so the number of maximally entangled pairs in each half , after purification is    @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the reduced density matrix of one of the qubits in the state shared between any end and the repeater before purification .",
    "the subscript @xmath42 in @xmath68 has been used to indicate the fact that now each qubit has traveled half the distance it would have had to travel for an undivided channel .",
    "the disentangled pairs after purification are discarded and only the pairs in a maximally entangled state are kept .",
    "a projection by a central operator to connect up the ends of the full channel with one maximally entangled state now requires one pair from each half , so @xmath69 is also the number of maximally entangled pairs that can be produced between the two ends of the entire channel .",
    "the number of maximally entangled states @xmath70 produced by an undivided channel and @xmath69 produced due to two half - channels is plotted in fig.[fig : c ] .",
    "analogous to the case of @xmath71 , at a certain value of @xmath17 , we get more final entanglement between the two ends of the channel if we split the channel and place repeaters .",
    "when these results are compared to distributing the state @xmath72 we see that they are not as good - i.e. using @xmath72 will give more maximally entangled states across the full channel .    as before",
    ", this idea can be generalized to splitting the channel into @xmath43 sections .",
    "each value of @xmath43 becomes the optimal number of channel sections ( for obtaining the maximum final entanglement , if the initial resources were kept constant ) after a certain value of @xmath17 .",
    "again , as before , we can calculate @xmath48 , the ratio of the number of initial sources required for the undivided channel to the number of initial sources required for the channel with repeaters .",
    "fig.[fig : d ] plots @xmath48 versus @xmath43 - the number of sections in the channel with repeaters , for @xmath73 .",
    "we see that in this case , @xmath51 sections ( two repeaters ) , gives the largest resource reduction over the undivided channel .",
    "we now consider sending the states through a different kind of channel - a pauli channel where there is just one type of error .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the final states produced on sending a pair of qubits in a maximally entangled initial state through this channel is a mixture of two bell states .",
    "the distillable entanglement for such states is exactly known @xcite .",
    "if we take the single error in the channel to be of the `` bit - flip '' type ( called the bit - flip channel @xcite ) , an initial state @xmath74 transforms as    @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "we relate the parameter @xmath77 to the length of the channel ( which is proportional to @xmath17 ) by    @xmath78 from ref.@xcite we know that the distillable entanglement for the state @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath82 . on using an undivided channel with @xmath0 sources placed at the midpoint",
    ", we would obtain @xmath83 $ ] particle pairs in a final maximally entangled state across the full length of the channel . on the other hand , if we divided the channel into @xmath43 sections , and placed @xmath84 sources at the midpoint of each segment , the final number of maximally entangled pairs across the full channel will be @xmath85 $ ] where @xmath86 , in which @xmath87 . in fig.[fig :",
    "pauli ] , we have plotted @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath17 exceeding a certain value , more final entanglement between the ends of the channel for a given initial resource is obtained on dividing the channel into two parts and using a repeater at their junction .",
    "as in the previous cases , we now consider how repeaters can be used to achieve the same final entanglement using less initial resources .",
    "the ratio of the number of initial sources required for the undivided channel to that required when the channel is split into @xmath43 sections with repeaters , is given by    @xmath90 this ratio @xmath48 is plotted in fig ( [ fig : paulired ] ) for @xmath91 and it can be seen that use of @xmath1 repeater to @xmath92 repeaters allow a smaller initial resource to create the same final amount of entanglement between the two ends of the full channel .    exactly the same results on resource reduction would hold for phase flip @xcite and bit - phase flip @xcite channels , as they all take initially maximally entangled states to final states which are mixtures of two bell states .",
    "we now consider more general channels . however , the final states produced when maximally entangled qubit pairs pass through these channels are such that their distillable entanglement is not known . for such channels we will use an established upper bound and a conjectured lower bound on distillable entanglement for comparing distribution with and without repeaters .",
    "the well established upper bound on distillable entanglement @xmath93 is the entanglement of formation @xmath94 @xcite , which is also simple to calculate for a @xmath95 system @xcite . as a lower bound on distillable entanglement , we will use a conjecture recently made by horodecki , horodecki and horodecki @xcite .",
    "this gives a lower bound on the distillable entanglement of a state @xmath96 of qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 by    @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the reduced density matrix of any one of the qubits . in ref.@xcite , this conjecture has been used to investigate an unified approach to quantum channel capacities and there is a significant body of evidence which lends support to this conjecture @xcite .",
    "for each type of channel , we first find the final density matrix @xmath100 of two qubits for distribution through an undivided channel ( with the source placed at the midpoint ) .",
    "we then calculate the density matrix @xmath101 of entangled qubits reaching adjacent repeaters from the midpoints of the corresponding sections when the channel is split into @xmath43 sections .",
    "we now compare the lower bound @xmath102 or @xmath103 on distillable entanglement for the channel with repeaters with the upper bound @xmath94 for an undivided channel . in this way",
    "we ensure that we are imparting no intrinsic advantage to the case of repeaters over the case of an undivided channel . as before , the resource reduction is quantified by the ratio @xmath48 ( defined in the same manner as earlier ) and this ratio is given ( assuming , without loss of generality , @xmath104 to be the smaller among @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) by    @xmath106 we consider three types of channels @xcite    * amplitude damping channel - i.e.  the full version of the watched channel * depolarising channel * phase damping channel      for the amplitude damping channel we consider sending two states down the channel , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this is because of the fact that the amplitude damping channel affects only the @xmath109 state and therefore has quite different effects on the above two states .",
    "the amplitude damping channel affects states in the following way @xcite    @xmath110 we relate @xmath15 to @xmath17 by the following @xmath111 fig.[fig : amp01 ] shows @xmath48 for @xmath112 and fig.[fig : amp00 ] for @xmath108 .",
    "we see that in the case of using the state @xmath113 , there could almost be a @xmath114 fold reduction of resources and in the case of the state @xmath115 , there can be nearly a @xmath116 fold reduction of resources if repeaters are used .",
    "the phase damping channel affects states as @xcite    @xmath117 we relate @xmath15 to @xmath17 by the following : @xmath118 this dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath17 has been so chosen that the entanglement of qubits propagating in this channel completely vanishes at @xmath119 .",
    "fig.[fig : phase ] shows @xmath48 for this channel .    in this case",
    "we see that the use of repeaters can lead to almost up to @xmath120 fold reduction in resources .",
    "the depolarizing channel affects states as    @xmath121 we relate @xmath15 to @xmath17 by the following : @xmath122 this dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath17 has been so chosen that the entanglement of qubits propagating in this channel completely vanishes at @xmath119 .",
    "fig.[fig : depol ] shows @xmath48 for this channel .",
    "in this case we see that use of repeaters can lead to , in the best case , a reduction as large as @xmath123 fold in resources . in the case of all channels",
    ", we see that the degree of resource reduction increases at first with the number of repeater stations and then starts to decrease on further increase of the number of repeaters .",
    "we have shown that the amount of initial resource of entanglement needed to establish a certain final amount of entanglement between two ends of a noisy channel can be reduced , for certain lengths of the channel , by using quantum repeaters .",
    "this result has important bearing on cost minimization in entanglement distribution .",
    "we have used a variety of channels and asymptotic values and bounds on distillable entanglement to arrive at our results . while in the original papers on quantum repeaters @xcite , the emphasis was on preventing the exponential degradation of entanglement through practically motivated specific purification procedures , our emphasis is more on attempting to use general results on distillable entanglement . as such , our results are quite independent of the type of the purification procedures used .",
    "we also use asymptotic measures of entanglement @xcite in our analysis in contrast to the earlier treatment @xcite based on fidelity of transmission of the states .",
    "though the field of entanglement measures is very well developed , there have not been many attempts ( apart from the natural application to entanglement purification @xcite ) to link these measures to practical issues such as the cost of entanglement distribution .",
    "we regard our analysis to be a step in this direction .",
    "all our analysis has been based on asymptotic purification procedures in order to use simple entropic quantities as bounds on distillable entanglement .",
    "however , the field of local entanglement manipulations for non - asymptotic cases has developed recently @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the possibility of resource reduction by repeaters in the case when only a small number of entangled qubit pairs are transmitted through the channel at a time .        c. h. bennett and d. p. divincenzo , nature * 404 * , 247 ( 2000 ) ; m.b . plenio and v. vedral , cont .",
