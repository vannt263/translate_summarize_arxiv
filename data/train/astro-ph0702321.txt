    "recent spectroscopic detection of lyman continuum ( lyc ) emission from individual @xmath1 galaxies @xcite represents a major step forward in analyzing the stellar contribution to the ionizing background at high redshifts . in a study of 14 @xmath1 star - forming ( sf ) galaxies @xcite have detected escaping ionizing radiation from two objects , concluding that there is significant variance in the emergent lyc spectrum .",
    "the nature of this variance is currently not understood , although it is undoubtedly linked to the physical conditions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at these high redshifts .",
    "comparison of observed lyc emission to theoretical models should in principle allow us to put constraints on the physics of sf in young galaxies and study the effect of stellar radiation on the thermal properties of high - redshift gas , including its role in maintaining cosmic reionization .",
    "one of the main parameters in this study is the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the clumpy ism , a quantity of primary importance in determining the contribution of the volumetric stellar luminosity to the ionizing background .    in (",
    "* paper i ) we presented calculations of the escape fraction of lyc photons from a large number of sf regions in two simulated high - redshift proto - galaxies .",
    "we found that the modeled redshift evolution of @xmath2 matches the observational findings of @xcite , namely the decline from @xmath3 at @xmath4 to @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "this decline is attributed to a much higher clustering of gas around the sf regions at lower redshifts , due to accretion of the intergalactic gas onto growing proto - galaxies . in this paper",
    "we extend these calculations to a larger set of ( proto- ) spiral galaxies covering a range of masses and study the dependence of our results on the amount of feedback per unit stellar mass encoded in the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we moreover determine galaxy - to - galaxy lyc emission variations at a given redshift and galaxy mass , as well as variations for a given galaxy along different lines of sight .",
    "we use results of high - resolution galaxy formation simulations in a standard lcdm cosmology done with a significantly improved version of the treesph code described by @xcite .",
    "the code employs the `` conservative '' entropy formulation @xcite , non - instantaneous gas recycling and chemical evolution with 10 elements @xcite , metallicity - dependent atomic radiative cooling , and self - shielding in regions with the mean free path of lyman limit photons below @xmath7 .",
    "all galaxies for this project were selected from a dark matter - only run of box length @xmath8 , which was then resimulated with the treesph code at higher resolution in lagrangian regions enclosing the galaxies .",
    "further details on this simulation set can be found in @xcite .",
    "table  [ models ] lists 11 galaxies , in order of increasing mass , for which we performed radiative transfer calculations around all their sf regions at @xmath0 , 2.95 and 2.39 .",
    "the first five are fairly small ( @xmath9 , see below ) , gas - rich galaxies that exhibit relatively little sf .",
    "galaxy 41 is an intermediate - size system with @xmath10 , whereas the rest are larger ( @xmath11 ) disk galaxies .",
    "the most massive galaxies were computed at `` normal '' resolution , with sph ( and star ) particle masses of @xmath12 and interpolated grid resolution of @xmath13 , the smaller galaxies were simulated with 8 times higher mass resolution and twice the force resolution .",
    "the only `` low '' resolution simulation was the @xmath14 galaxy with particle masses of @xmath15 .",
    "all galaxies in table  [ models ] are labeled by their @xmath16 characteristic circular velocities , which were calculated using the technique described in @xcite . for our purpose ,",
    "the present - day @xmath17 is a good measure of @xmath1 galaxy dynamical masses for a number of reasons .",
    "first , galaxies tend to grow in size from @xmath18 to @xmath16 , but not so much in @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , there is a fairly tight relation between the @xmath18 stellar and virial masses and the @xmath16 ones .",
    "this is simply explained by the fact that our sample contains only field galaxies , which become disks by @xmath16 .",
    "all of them have relatively quiet @xmath19 merging histories ; in fact , at @xmath18 it is already fairly easy to identify the main proto - galaxy .",
    "finally , most of our @xmath18 systems have several proto - galactic components , and our results at @xmath20 account for absorption and stellar emission in all of these components , not just the main proto - galaxy .",
    "note that stellar masses , on the other hand , are sensitive to the feedback scenario as we will show in section 3.1 , and can not be uniquely described by @xmath17 which is rather the measure of the galaxy s dynamical mass .",
    "we model sf with a set of discrete star `` particles '' , which represent a population of stars born at almost the same time in accordance with a given imf .",
    "the stellar uv luminosity is determined using the population synthesis package starburst 1999 @xcite with continuous sf distributed among all stars younger than @xmath21 . to compute the time - dependent ionization by stellar photons",
    ", we use the point source radiative transfer algorithm on adaptively refined meshes first employed in paper i. this algorithm extends the adaptive ray - splitting scheme of @xcite to a model with variable grid resolution . around each sf region",
    "we build a system of @xmath22 radial rays that split either as we move farther away from the source or as we enter a refined cell .",
    "once a radial ray is refined angularly , it stays refined at larger distances from the source , even if we leave the high - resolution region . in each cell",
    "we accumulate the ionization and heating rates due to photons travelling along ray segments passing through that cell .",
    "these rates are then used to update temperature and the ionization state of hydrogen and helium , as a function of time .    to study the sensitivity of our results to the strength of stellar feedback which is in turn a function of the number of massive stars in our sf regions , we adopt two different but widely used imfs , the standard @xcite and the triple - interval @xcite imf .",
    "the salpeter imf produces approximately twice as much snii feedback and stellar ionizing radiation per unit stellar mass compared to the kroupa imf .",
    "however , both imfs result in less feedback than the more top - heavy imf used in paper i. the snii feedback and chemical enrichment are included into the hydrodynamical models , whereas the propagation of ionizing stellar photons is traced with post - process radiative transfer , as detailed in paper i.    we do not include the effects of dust in our current calculations . the fact that our models in paper i which did not include dust matched well the observationally determined escape fractions of @xcite as a function of z , for @xmath23 , can be taken as indirect evidence that dust may be not of primary importance in controlling lyc escape fractions and luminosities of young galaxies . on the other hand , a number of physical processes such as cooling and molecule formation depend on dust density and composition .",
    "dust forms from heavier elements , and metallicity of our galaxies is fairly high , e.g. the iron abundances range from @xmath24\\sim-1.2 $ ] for the smallest galaxies to @xmath25\\sim -0.4 $ ] for the largest .",
    "unfortunately , the physics of dust grain growth and destruction is extremely complicated and is well beyond the scope of the present paper , although we are planning to include a simple parametric description into our future simulations .",

    "we confirm our earlier conclusion @xcite that @xmath2 shows tendency to decrease with time due to increased clustering of gas near the sf regions .",
    "this can be illustrated by plotting the density distribution of gas and stars in individual galaxies as a function of redshift .",

    "higher gas clustering near sf regions at @xmath19 is evident .",
    "note that the horizontal axis in this plot does not necessarily indicate the densities at which stars form but rather densities at which star particles are found at a specific redshift .",
    "feedback tends to evacuate gas from the sf regions , therefore , some stellar particles can be hosted by cells with very little gas left .",
    "[ levels - s93 - 06 - 64-k15 - 06 - 8 ] shows on a linear scale the fraction of stellar particles younger than @xmath21 , as a function of the refinement level , for the same two galaxies .",
    "the nested grid structure was created from the sph particle distribution using the gas density as a refinement criterion .",
    "stars form in highly overdense regions the average density of which increases with time as more gas accretes onto growing proto - galaxies from the intergalactic medium .",
    "this is particularly evident in small galaxies such as 93 , with a gradual rise in the average density of sf regions from @xmath0 to @xmath31 , leading to a decline in ionizing uv output .",
    "note that all lower mass galaxies in fig .",
    "[ escapefraction - k98-s ] display a drop in @xmath2 in this redshift interval .",
    "larger field galaxies such as 15 already accumulated a massive amount of gas by @xmath0 and exhibit somewhat more limited growth at lower redshifts , while their sf regions are skewed to more dense environments .",
    "consequently , massive galaxies have already fairly small @xmath2 even at early times , and in some cases they can even show a rise in @xmath2 at lower redshifts , such as in galaxies 33 , 29 , 26 with the salpeter imf .",
    "overall , we find significant variations from galaxy to galaxy , especially in the lower - mass systems , with the salpeter imf lyman - limit @xmath2 varying from @xmath32 in 115 to @xmath33 in 87 .",
    "@xcite found that early , fairly strong bursts of sf converting several percent of the initial gas mass into stars with the salpeter imf can substantially alleviate the disk galaxy angular momentum problem , as feedback from these starbursts can blow a larger fraction of the remaining gas out of the small proto - galactic clumps , with this gas later gradually settling to form extended disks .",
    "these models were later expanded to include the kroupa imf @xcite , and at the moment they still underpredict the observed angular momenta of @xmath16 disk galaxies by approximately a factor of @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "these models feature fairly realistic high - redshift systems which reproduce the sub - mm properties of lyman break galaxies @xcite , show extended ly@xmath35 emission @xcite , and have fairly small stellar cores at @xmath18 consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "we now focus on the effect of the imf on lyc emission . with",
    "the salpeter imf the stronger feedback at early times suppresses sf relative to the kroupa case yielding less massive @xmath1 stellar components ( fig .",
    "[ stellarmass ] ) , and building up a larger reservoir of hot gas around the galaxy .",
    "this results in an anti - correlation between @xmath2 and the number of young ( @xmath36 ) stars at @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ doubleratio - k98-s ] ) : the stronger feedback there is in a galaxy , the fewer stars it forms , but also the higher @xmath2 it gets as the same amount of gas is being dispersed over a larger volume , and more neutral gas is ionized per unit stellar mass . this anti - correlation reduces the sensitivity of the absolute uv luminosity to the fraction of massive stars encoded in the imf .",
    "for example , in galaxy 87 ( @xmath37 ) at @xmath0 its salpeter @xmath2 is about 10 higher than the kroupa @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ ratio - k98-s]a ) , however , it has 93 young stellar particles with the salpeter imf , while the kroupa imf results in 444 particles .",
    "the result is that its salpeter luminosity is only @xmath38 times higher than its kroupa luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ ratio - k98-s]b ) .    eventually , the feedback can not prevent the cool - out of hot gas , which sooner or later leads to a rise in sf .",
    "in fact , salpeter galaxies tend to produce more stars than kroupa galaxies at later times , as can be seen in the number of young stars along the horizontal axis in fig .",
    "[ doubleratio - k98-s ] at @xmath31 . by this time , however , there is no correlation between the escape fractions and the number of recent starbursts , as consistently stronger feedback has a very non - linear effect on the gas distribution at lower redshift . on one hand , models with higher feedback rates per unit stellar mass",
    "generally have more gas left over for sf from earlier times , and by @xmath31 some of this gas might have cooled back into dense clouds in the disk ism . therefore , combined supernova winds now have to push through a thicker layer of material , unless all of this cool - out gas has been efficiently converted into stars on a short timescale which is unlikely . on the other hand ,",
    "irrespective of the earlier sf history , stronger feedback might still clear channels through which ionizing photons escape into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the end result is that all these processes create a very complex porous ism , with lower average @xmath2 , but higher variations from galaxy to galaxy , and a larger scatter when we vary the imf ( fig .",
    "[ ratio - k98-s]a , b ) , as by now many effects contribute to the value of @xmath2 .",
    "gas blowout is expected to be less efficient in already formed disk galaxies as it drives a typically much smaller fraction of interstellar gas in bipolar outflows perpendicular to the disk @xcite .",
    "as one would expect , in our models the escape fractions show a weaker dependence on the feedback strength in the most massive galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ ratio - k98-s]a ) .",
    "it is interesting that in two galaxies ( 29 and 33 ) stronger feedback leads to lower @xmath2 even at @xmath0 .",
    "close examination reveals that with the salpeter imf these fairly massive galaxies expelled a large amount of gas prior to this epoch , whereas in the kroupa imf case a noticeable fraction of this gas was converted into stars early into the run . with the salpeter imf , by @xmath0 this gas is falling back onto the galaxies supplying cold material to the sf regions .",
    "in addition , galaxy 29 has two components very close to each other , and some of the expelled gas is actually trapped in the common gravitational field before accreting back onto both components .",
    "the luminosity of each galaxy is a product of the original imf spectrum , the number of sf regions in the galaxy , the sf rate of each region which depends on the mass of a stellar particle , and the escape fraction . in fig .",
    "[ luminosities - k98-s ] we plot the specific ( per unit frequency ) lyman - limit luminosity @xmath39 of each galaxy vs. its circular velocity , at all three redshifts .",
    "overall , the lyman - limit luminosities of galaxies simulated using the two different imfs follow similar trends with @xmath17 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that for most systems @xmath39 is higher at earlier times , meaning that galaxies become an increasingly more important source of ionizing photons relative to quasars the number density of which declines rapidly at @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ luminosities - k98-s ] are of great importance in relation to the ionization history of the universe , and we shall return to this topic in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we also find that the average cosmic galactic lyc luminosity which in our models decreases monotonically from @xmath0 to 2.4 , most notably in the low mass galaxies , is anti - correlated with the star formation rate in the same galaxies , which rises during this redshift interval .",
    "for the 5 small ( @xmath42 ) galaxies in our sample , the average sf rates are 1.8 , 2.6 and 2.7 @xmath43 at @xmath0 , 2.95 and 2.39 for the kroupa galaxies , and 0.6 , 1.4 and 2.8 @xmath43 for the salpeter galaxies , respectively .",
    "for the larger galaxies , the evolution of the sf rate with redshift is more flat in the @xmath44 interval . both above findings",
    "are in qualitative agreement with the observational result of @xcite , that the galaxy ( non - ionizing ) uv luminosity function gradually rises at the faint end from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , while the bright end of the luminosity function exhibits virtually no evolution .    in fig .",
    "[ magnitudeluminosity ] we plot the lyman - limit luminosities of all galaxies in our sample vs. their optical luminosities , at @xmath47 .",
    "the optical luminosity is tightly coupled to the number of bright stars , whereas the ionizing luminosity also depends on the amount of absorbing neutral gas in the vicinity of sf regions . as gas blowout is less efficient in more massive galaxies ,",
    "the supply of material available for sf does not depend so strongly on the feedback strength , and the optical luminosity of such galaxies is less affected when varying the imf .",
    "the ionizing luminosities , on the other hand , are sensitive to the conditions near sf regions and show variations even in already formed massive systems .",
    "it is also seen from fig .",
    "[ magnitudeluminosity ] that the effects of changing the imf on the lyc and optical luminosities , respectively , are essentially uncorrelated .      to probe conditions inside the ism",
    ", it is instructive to look at the radial dependence of absorption as a function of redshift in one of our galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ radial ] we show the @xmath48-averaged distribution of @xmath2 for all star particles in the more massive galaxy 15 , computed with the kroupa imf , as a function of redshift and the distance from these particles . at all five redshifts a significant fraction of photons reaches the radius @xmath49 , although this fraction decreases with time as more gas",
    "is clustered around the sf regions . at @xmath50",
    "the redshift evolution is more noticeable , as very few sources have @xmath51 at @xmath31 . in other words ,",
    "a random observer sitting inside this galaxy would see lyc directly from @xmath52 of the young stars in that galaxy at @xmath53 and from only a few @xmath54 of the stars at @xmath31 . for a distant observer beyond this galaxy s virial radius of @xmath55 , the average lyman - limit escape fraction drops from @xmath56 to @xmath57 in the above redshift interval .",
    "in section 3.1 we saw that for galaxies of a given mass the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter in the lyc emission can be partially attributed to variations in the physical conditions in the clumpy ism _ surrounding _ the sf regions ( factor of @xmath58 for either of the selected imfs in fig .",
    "[ luminosities - k98-s ] ) .    in this section",
    "we examine variations in _",
    "apparent _ lyc luminosities caused by orientation effects , i.e. that galaxies will be oriented in a random way with respect to an observer .",
    "the source - to - source scatter in @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ radial ] ) and a non - uniform gas distribution in host galaxies invariably translate into angular variations . in fig .",
    "[ angularvariation.k15 - 06 - 8][angularvariation.k93 - 06 - 64 ] we plot the angular dependence of @xmath2 for two galaxies , the more massive 15 and the small 93 , at three different redshifts , both galaxies computed with the kroupa imf . for salpeter galaxies",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively the same . in both plots",
    "the x - axis gives the index of the angular pixel in the healpix @xcite notation , covering the entire @xmath48 in @xmath59 bins .",
    "essentially , it is as an index along a fractal space - filling curve going through all bins on the sky ( as seen from the galaxy ) in which @xmath2 was computed , with each bin covering the same solid angle . for the more massive galaxy 15 , especially with the kroupa imf",
    ", we can see two spikes corresponding to the face - on orientation of the galaxy , with @xmath2 @xmath58 times the average .    in fig .",
    "[ angularprobability ] we plot the angular probability distribution function of @xmath2 for two salpeter and two kroupa galaxies , at all three redshifts .",
    "the vertical axis shows the fraction of angular bins per unit log @xmath2 , such that the area under each curve is exactly unity .",
    "the decline of @xmath2 with time is evident in all four panels , but more interesting is the scatter of about an order of magnitude in @xmath2 depending on orientation to the observer .",
    "this , together with the intrinsic lyc luminosity variation from galaxy to galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ luminosities - k98-s ] ) explains why in magnitude - limited surveys only a fraction of galaxies are detected in direct lyc emission @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we presented calculations of the lyc emission from 11 ( proto- ) disk galaxies in the redshift range @xmath44 , modeled with the standard salpeter and kroupa imfs . to calculate the ionization structure of the interstellar medium in each galaxy , we performed time - dependent numerical radiative transfer around a large number ( up to @xmath60 ) of sf regions modeled with discrete star particles .",
    "our findings are as follows :    \\1 ) although we find significant variations in the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxy to galaxy , we confirm our earlier results on the average decrease of @xmath2 from @xmath0 to 2.4 for the entire range of galaxy masses , as more gas cools and accretes onto galaxies , forming stars in progressively clumpier environments .",
    "the resulting lyc luminosity of individual galaxies declines gradually over this redshift interval , by nearly an order of magnitude for lower - mass galaxies , and a smaller factor for more massive objects .",
    "we also note that this result is not sensitive to the assumed imf , at least within the range of feedback parameters normally associated with the widely used salpeter and kroupa imfs .",

    "\\3 ) we predict that the cosmic galactic ionizing uv luminosity would be monotonically decreasing from @xmath0 to 2.4 .",
    "some fraction of smaller galaxies in clusters can turn on their sf for the first time during this redshift interval due to tidal effects , however , the intrinsic changes in most field galaxies associated with continuous gas infall would lead to a decline in the lyc comoving luminosity density .",
    "on the other hand , there is evidence that the galaxy non - ionizing uv luminosity function gradually rises at the faint end from @xmath45 to @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that our findings do not contradict these data , as indeed we see a rise by a factor of @xmath61 in the number of young stars from @xmath0 to 2.4 in all our small galaxies , consistent with continuous gas infall .",
    "we are planning to study the non - ionizing uv luminosity function in the same set of galaxies in the future .",
    "\\4 ) the higher escape fractions as well as lyc luminosities found at @xmath0 , compared to the lower redshifts , also support the notion that galaxies become a progressively more important source of ionizing photons as one goes back in time , as the comoving number density of quasars declines rapidly at @xmath41 @xcite .",
