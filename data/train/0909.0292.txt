    "the experiment e735 at fermilab studied @xmath14 collisions in the tevatron collider at center of mass energy @xmath15 tev .",
    "the production of particles and their @xmath16 spectra at rapidity y=0 were recorded along with associated multiplicity and any other accessible information .",
    "these results have been published in several articles  @xcite .",
    "a few of the production rates were reported as absolute inclusive cross sections , while others were reported as rates relative to some simultaneously observed production processes .",
    "the purpose of this article is to assemble the various rate data and to present them all as absolute cross sections .",
    "such a presentation reveals patterns which are relevant to specific production models such as the statistical model , string model , parton collision models , or the quark gluon plasma .",
    "during the data taking period the accelerator operators made periodic measurements of accelerator parameters with flying wires  @xcite and wallcurrent monitors  @xcite to enable a calculation of our luminosity as a function of time .",
    "a careful analysis of the luminosity data was subsequently tabulated by gelfand , grosso - pilcher , and white  @xcite and made available to experimentalists .",
    "the luminosity data can be used to obtain an absolute cross section for the production of any one particle species from the relation    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the measured luminosity as a function of time , @xmath19 is some cross section of interest , and @xmath20 is the number of events which are associated with that cross section during the time interval @xmath21 . we have previously used the luminosity tabulations together with eq.([lum ] ) to calculate and publish invariant production cross sections for photons  @xcite , phi mesons  @xcite , deuterium , and tritium  @xcite .",
    "luminosity issues are discussed in more detail later in this article .",
    "we have repeated our previous analysis of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 inclusive production with some refinements that were intended to reduce background , minimize tracking losses , and improve resolution in the time - of - flight mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "the new @xmath25 ratio remained within 1.3% of that reported in previous publications , but the relative charged kaon flux increased @xmath261.4 standard deviations with the new analysis .",
    "raw data were corrected for detector and trigger efficiencies , trigger pre - scaling , trigger dead time , and particle loss in 0.09 absorption lengths of the spectrometer arm before the last time - of - flight wall at 4 meters .",
    "absolute cross sections @xmath0 were calculated for these three positively charged particles .",
    "table [ sig_table ] gives a list of measured single particle cross sections as collected from various sources .",
    "column 1 lists the particles studied .",
    "antiparticle cross sections were the same as particle cross sections within errors .",
    "however , the cross section for antitritium was not measurable .",
    "errors listed here are the result of convolution of statistical and systematic errors .",
    "information on the associated particle multiplicity and the invariant @xmath16 spectra @xmath27 for all these particles can be found in references cited in the table .",
    "the cross section listed for inclusive single photon production is twice the inclusive cross section of a charged pion within errors .",
    "if one assumes production of a neutral pion is equal to production of a charged pion , this value is consistent with the assertion in reference @xcite that single photon production originates with the two - photon decay of the neutral pion and possibly some small admixture of eta decay .    in calculating invariant cross sections for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,",
    "we make use of particle ratios in reference @xcite such as @xmath30 $ ] `` in the spectrometer arm '' .",
    "although it is not explicitly stated in reference @xcite , these actually are _ rapidity _ based ratios  @xcite such as @xmath31/ [ dn(p+\\bar p)/dy|_{y=0}],$ ] where @xmath32 is the number of particles per unit rapidity .",

[ cols=\"^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if nuclei are really formed in nucleon - nucleon collisions , it should be relatively easy to verify the fact with suitable triggers in conjunction with one of the high resolution detectors that currently exist",
    ". it would be essential to require that the instrumentation not saturate on pulse heights up to 10x-20x minimum ionization .",
    "the high statistics expected for the lightest nuclei ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) would permit one to study the extent to which they are produced in pairs or to put limits on the equality of nuclear and antinuclear cross sections . because a temperature of @xmath38 mev also seems to organize the hadron production cross sections from @xmath8 collisions , it may be useful to search for nuclear production in those data sets as well .",
    "little bang nucleosynthesis ( lbn ) would seem to be quite different from big bang nuleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite .",
    "bbn begins with a large net baryon number , but lbn begins with zero net baryon number , initiated perhaps by annihilation or by gluon - gluon interaction .",
    "electrons and photons participate in bbn in a large way , but there is little evidence for either of these in lbn ( see section iv ) . in bbn nuclei are formed at temperatures comparable to nuclear binding energies .",
    "nuclei from lbn appear to be formed somehow in an environment with temperatures that are many times larger than nuclear binding energies .",
    "plotted points are relic cosmic abundances of @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 relative to hydrogen  @xcite after dividing each ratio by @xmath41 .",
    "variations of the big bang nucleosynthesis model strive to reproduce these data points .",
    "the solid curve when used with @xmath42 has the slope for @xmath38 mev , which fits elementary particle production in this paper .",
    "the dashed curve represents a temperature modification which might accomodate nuclear size.,height=336 ]    fig .",
    "[ big_bang_sigs ] has been included here to illustrate the extent to which lbn fails to reproduce the relic cosmic abundances that bbn accounts for so well  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of cosmic abundances relative to hydrogen have been divided by @xmath41 for plotting .",
    "nuclear curves from fig .",
    "[ nucl_temp ] have been inserted into the figure for comparison .",
    "this paper has presented 9 absolute cross sections ( @xmath0 ) for particle production at @xmath43 to colliding @xmath24 and @xmath44 beams with @xmath2 tev .",
    "one of these cross sections is for photon production .",
    "two are for nuclear production .",
    "the remaining six are for light elementary hadron production .",
    "the six hadron cross sections were corrected for secondary contributions from decays of higher masses in order to produce a set of six primary cross sections .",
    "when the primary cross sections are divided by the spin degeneracy @xmath41 of individual particles , we learn that the primary cross sections per spin state precisely follow an exponentially decreasing distribution in particle rest mass with a temperature @xmath45 mev . by summing over all spin states ,",
    "one finds the total primary cross section for a particle of specified charge , spin j , and rest mass m is given by    @xmath46    using an argument based on the uncertainty principle , we set @xmath4 , where @xmath6 is a hadronic radius given by @xmath47 fm . for nuclear production",
    "we replace @xmath6 by @xmath48 and find a temperature @xmath49 . when @xmath49 is used in eq.([lambar_exp ] ) , it yields an acceptable value for the anti deuteron cross section .",
    "this purely thermal production mechanism exhibits no significant strangeness suppression , implying that experimentally observed strangeness suppression is entirely explained by contributions from decay products of higher masses . as discussed in section iv , we were unable to observe any primary production at the photon and electron masses , so the thermal mechanism is probably relevant only for strongly interacting particles .",
    "it appears there may be two temperatures that are useful in describing the entire particle production process .",
    "the temperature t=204 mev precisely describes the primary particle ratios in the initially produced state , and a temperature t=132 mev describes the momentum distributions in a final decay state in which pions have a uniquely low momentum .",
    "an exothermic transition between the production state and decay state might account for a transverse flow velocity of @xmath13 .",
    "the average kinetic energy per particle associated with this transverse flow is @xmath50 mev , and thus it is not a trivial amount .",
    "it is possible to observe the thermal production mechanism in @xmath14 collisions at @xmath43 ( y=0 ) because of its dominant cross sections in the low mass region . for the production of masses in or above the charm sector",
    "there is evidence that other mechanisms such as parton scattering become dominant .",
    "the dominance may extend to many orders of magnitude at the highest particle masses .",
    "we have examined cross sections for hadron production in the charm sector by @xmath8 collisions using published values of multiplicity fractions . to the degree that decay branching ratios are well known , we find that primary @xmath8 multiplicity fractions also follow a boltzmann distribution in mass for a temperature @xmath38 mev . there is no significant evidence for strangeness suppression in the charm sector examined .",
    "since the @xmath51 meson is essentially a primary particle with negligible secondary contributions , one can possibly gain some insight into the origin of the thermal mechanism by studying @xmath51 production .",
    "the @xmath51 cross section at @xmath43 is consistent with being the same for @xmath52 and @xmath14 collisions over a range of center of mass energies that vary by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "this may suggest that gluon interactions rather than annihilations are the essential source of the thermal production .",
    "we would like to thank v. barger , c. goebel , t. han , and s. dasu for helpful discussions .",
    "we are also indebted to matt herndon for answering our numerous questions about the cdf detector .",
    "o. biebel made very helpful suggestions for data sources .",
    "useful hints on locating nuclear data were supplied by f. ajzenberg - selove and h. taub .",
    "we have used partial cross sections and raw data found in the literature to make estimates of total inclusive cross sections for four massive particles .",
    "the fact that experimenters themselves did not present total cross sections testifies to the difficulty and large uncertainty associated with such calculations .",
    "nevertheless the estimates made below may be useful within an order of magnitude .",
    "prompt @xmath9 s are those which are consistent with originating at the beam line rather than from detached vertices .",
    "since the entire @xmath16 spectrum was measured for the @xmath9 in this experiment , we used that information to correct the measured value upward by a factor of 1.28 before dividing by the effective interval @xmath55 . the result given below",
    "was divided by @xmath56 and plotted in fig .",
    "[ predict ] .",
    "@xmath57    @xmath58 : using a detached vertex trigger , cdf measured the @xmath58 cross section as a function of @xmath16 above @xmath59 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "we have used the @xmath9 momentum spectrum as a guide to increase this cross section by a factor of 30.6 to account for the unmeasured portion of the @xmath16 spectrum .",
    "dividing by the effective rapidity interval of @xmath60 , we estimate @xmath61        we divide this number by integrated luminosity @xmath64 and multiply by 10 to correct for @xmath9 acceptance over the rapidity range when @xmath9 momentum is @xmath65 gev / c .",
    "we multiply by 3.26 to correct the unobserved @xmath9 momentum spectrum below @xmath66 gev / c using the @xmath16 spectra of reference @xcite as a guide .",
    "we divide by 0.0593 to correct for the branching fraction of @xmath9 into the observed @xmath67 pair  @xcite and multiply by @xmath68 to estimate a typical probability for hadron decay into @xmath9 . dividing the resulting cross section by @xmath60",
    ", we obtain @xmath69        we divide this by 2 to obtain a cross section only for hadrons and by @xmath55 to estimate @xmath33 .",
