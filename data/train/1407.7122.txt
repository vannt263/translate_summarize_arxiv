    "multinucleon emission by electroweak probes is of much interest nowadays  @xcite .",
    "evidence of its presence in the quasielastic ( qe ) peak region has been emphasized in the analysis of recent neutrino and antineutrino scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by theoretical calculations  @xcite , including in the dynamics various nuclear effects such as meson - exchange currents ( mec ) with and without @xmath0-isobar excitations , final - state interactions ( fsi ) , short - range correlations ( src ) , the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , effective interactions , _ etc .",
    "_ these ingredients lead to discrepancies between the theoretical predictions , and these need to be clarified in order to reduce the systematic uncertainties in neutrino data analyses  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of two - nucleon ejection in monte carlo ( mc ) neutrino event generators requires an algorithm to generate events of two - nucleon final states from given values of momentum and energy transfer .",
    "the standard way to proceed , followed in @xcite , is to select two nucleons from the fermi sea , invoke energy - momentum conservation and compute the four - momentum of the final two - nucleon state ( selecting two nucleon momenta in the final state ) . in the cm frame one",
    "assumes that the two final nucleons move back - to - back with the same given energy and opposite momentum .",
    "the emission angles are chosen assuming an isotropic distribution in the cm .",
    "once the final momenta are given , a boost is performed to the lab system to obtain the momenta of the two ejected nucleons in this frame ; these are then further propagated in the mc cascade model .",
    "we have recently studied the angular distribution in the lab frame corresponding to two - particle ( 2p ) emission in the frozen nucleon approximation  @xcite , where the two nucleons are initially at rest .",
    "this distribution appears in the phase - space integration of the inclusive hadronic tensor in the 2p-2h channel .",
    "we found that the angular distribution has singularities coming from the jacobian obtained by integration of the dirac delta function of energy conservation , where a denominator appears that can be zero for some angles .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that for a fixed pair of hole momenta @xmath1 , and for given momentum transfer , @xmath2 , and emission angle @xmath3 of the first particle , there are two solutions for the momentum of the ejected nucleon @xmath4 that are compatible with energy conservation . for a given value of the energy transfer @xmath5 , these two solutions",
    "collapse into only one for the maximum allowed emission angle . for this angle",
    "there is a minimum in the 2p-2h excitation energy , @xmath6 , as a function of @xmath4 , and therefore the derivative that appears in the denominator of the jacobian is zero : @xmath7 .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the divergence of the angular distribution in the lab system is of the type @xmath8 .",
    "hence it is integrable around zero , and we gave an analytic formula for the integral around the divergence .",
    "the interest of the detailed study of the angular integral was to reduce the cpu time in the calculation of the hadronic tensor for inclusive neutrino scattering . here",
    "a 7d integral appears that has to be computed in a reasonable time in order to use it to predict flux integrated neutrino cross sections , where one additional integration is needed .    in this paper",
    "we show that the isotropic angular distribution in the cm frame , as the one used in monte carlo generators  @xcite , corresponds exactly to the angular distribution obtained by us in the lab system after integration of the dirac delta function of energy .",
    "although this correspondence seems to be evident , in practice it is not so obvious because in monte carlo generators no integration of a delta function of energy is explicitly performed , or at least no jacobian is present in the algorithm to select the emission angle  @xcite .",
    "that means that the phase - space angular distribution in the monte carlo codes is known except for a normalization factor . besides it was not evident earlier why the divergence in the angular distribution appears in the lab system from a constant distribution in the cm and how it can be handled by the monte carlo procedure .",
    "furthermore , we also show that upon performing the phase - space integral in the cm system one finds that the result is analytic if there is no pauli blocking , and we give a simple formula for it in the frozen nucleon approximation .",
    "this integration method in the cm frame provides an alternative way to compute the hadronic tensor in neutrino and electron scattering .",
    "the interest of the present study is directly linked to the reliability of the frozen nucleon approximation to get sensible results for intermediate to high momentum and energy transfers .",
    "this was already applied to a preliminary evaluation of the hadronic tensor in the case of the seagull current .",
    "moreover the frozen nucleon approximation is the leading term if the current is expanded in powers of ( h1,h2 ) around ( 0,0 ) .",
    "an integral over the emission angle remains to be performed . under the assumption that the dependence of the elementary hadronic tensor on the emission angle is soft , one could factorize it out of the integral , evaluating it for some average angle , say @xmath9 , times the phase - space integral .",
    "in fact , the strong dependence of the electroweak matrix elements comes from the @xmath10 dependence of the electroweak form factor and not from the angular dependence for fixed @xmath10 .",
    "the validity of these assumptions will be verified in a coming paper where the angular dependence of the elementary hadronic tensor will be studied .    in section",
    "ii we present a detailed study of the general formalism with explicit evaluation of the phase space and discussions on how to perform explicitly the boost between the two reference frames , lab and cm .",
    "we introduce all of the variables required to analyze the 2p-2h problem and make contact with the frozen nucleon approximation where the calculations can be done in a straightforward way .",
    "importantly , we show that these ideas can be incorporated into fully relativistic 2p-2h analyses of neutrino reactions . in section iii",
    "we summarize our basic findings and point out the main issues to be considered in future work , _",
    "i.e. , _ in any approach that attempts to take into account two - nucleon ejection effects in lepton scattering reactions .",
    "the starting point is the 2p-2h hadronic tensor for neutrino and electron scattering in the lab system , given in the fermi gas by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the four momentum transfer , @xmath13 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath14 is the volume of the system .",
    "the four - momenta of the final particles and holes are @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "momentum conservation implies @xmath17 .",
    "the initial fermi gas ground state and pauli blocking imply that @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "these conditions are included in the @xmath20 function , defined as the product of step functions @xmath21 the function @xmath22 is the hadronic tensor for the elementary transition of a nucleon pair with the given initial and final momenta , summed over spin and isospin  @xcite .",
    "we choose the @xmath23 direction to be along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "then the above integral is reduced to 7 dimensions .",
    "first there is a global rotational symmetry over one of the azimuthal angles .",
    "we choose @xmath25 and multiply by a factor @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , the energy delta function enables an analytic integration over @xmath4 .",
    "this 7d integral has to be performed numerically  @xcite . under some approximations",
    "@xcite the number of dimensions can be further reduced , but this can not be done in the fully relativistic calculation .    in a previous paper  @xcite we compared different methods to evaluate the above integral numerically .",
    "in particular we studied the special case of the phase - space function @xmath27 , obtained by using a constant elementary tensor @xmath28 ( independent of the kinematics ) , defined , except for a factor @xmath29 , as @xmath30 with @xmath17 .    for fixed hole momenta ,",
    "the energy of the two final particles is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the final momentum of the pair . for fixed emission angle @xmath3",
    ", we integrate over @xmath4 changing to the variable @xmath33 . by differentiation",
    "we arrive at the following jacobian [ note that the jacobian of @xcite agrees with eq .",
    "( [ jacobiano2 ] ) ] @xmath34 with @xmath35 . now integration of the dirac delta function of energy gives @xmath36 and the phase - space function becomes @xmath37 where the sum inside the integral runs over the two solutions @xmath38 of the energy conservation equation which is quadratic in @xmath4 .",
    "the explicit expressions of the two solutions are given in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the angular dependence of the integrand .",
    "we define the angular distribution function for fixed values of @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 correspond to the two terms of the sum .",
    "once more @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath43 thus measures the distribution of final nucleons as a function of the angle @xmath3 .",
    "note that this function is computed analytically in the lab system , given as a sum over the two solutions of the energy conservation condition .",
    "thus there are really two distributions corresponding to the two possible energies of final particles for a given emission angle .",
    "the angular distribution is referred to the first particle .",
    "the second one is determined by energy - momentum conservation .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the angular distribution in eq .",
    "( [ angular ] ) has divergences for some angles where the denominator coming from the jacobian is zero .",
    "examples were given in the frozen nucleon approximation .",
    "it was also shown that the divergence is integrable , and an analytic formula was given for the integral over @xmath3 around the divergence .",
    "the integral in the remaining intervals was performed numerically .      in monte carlo event generators",
    "the angular distribution is obtained from an isotropic distribution in the cm frame , and then transformed back to the lab system .",
    "here we show that our distribution is recovered except for a normalization constant that we determine .",
    "first we fix the kinematics of @xmath39 . to simplify our formalism , we consider the particular case of the frozen nucleon approximation , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath44",
    ". the general case can be done similarly .",
    "the frozen nucleon approximation has the advantage that the total final momentum is equal to @xmath45 and hence the cm frame moves in the z - direction ( `` upwards '' ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath46 components are invariant under the boost from the cm to the lab frames . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the frozen nucleon approximation gives an accurate representation of the total phase - space function , so one expects the angular distribution in the frozen nucleon approximation to be representative of the general case .",
    "doubly - primed variables refer to the cm system .",
    "the total final momentum is @xmath47 and the total final energy @xmath48 is determined by invariance of the squared four momentum @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the final energy and momentum in the lab frame .    in the cm frame",
    "the two final nucleons are assumed to go back - to - back with the same momentum and with the same energy @xmath51 the condition @xmath52 restricts the allowed @xmath53 region where the two - nucleon emission is possible .",
    "let @xmath54 be the emission angle corresponding to the first particle . to obtain the nucleon momentum in the lab system",
    "we perform a boost of the four vector @xmath55 back to the lab frame , that is moving downward the @xmath24-axis with dimensionless velocity @xmath56 , where this is the velocity of the cm system with respect to the lab system , given by @xmath57 the boost transformation of the @xmath58 four - vector components is given by a @xmath59 lorentz matrix equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig1 ] we show the lab emission angle as a function of the cm angle for momentum and energy transfers : @xmath64 gev / c and @xmath65 gev .",
    "we choose in this case a high value of the momentum transfer to avoid effects linked to pauli blocking .",
    "the @xmath5 value is close to the qe peak , @xmath68 , and below it .",
    "as the cm angle runs from 0 to 180 degrees , for this kinematics the lab angle starts growing , reaches a maximum and then decreases .",
    "therefore , for a given emission angle in the lab system , @xmath3 , there correspond two angles in the cm , that we denote @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "they differ in the value of the lab momentum @xmath4 , that is plotted in the lower panel of fig .  1 .",
    "hence there are two different values of @xmath4 for a given lab angle . these two @xmath4-values obviously correspond to the two solutions , @xmath71 of energy conservation , appearing in the sum of the phase - space function in eqs .",

    "the momentum of the second nucleon , @xmath72 , could be obtained by changing @xmath67 by @xmath73 in eq .",

    "we assume that the angular distribution in the cm frame is independent of the emission angle , except for pauli blocking restictions , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant that is determined below .",
    "the step function ensures pauli blocking .",
    "the angular distribution in the lab system , @xmath76 , is obtained by imposing conservation of the number of particles emitted within two corresponding solid angles @xmath77 and @xmath78 , in the lab and the cm systems @xmath79 since the boost conserves the azimuthal angle @xmath80 , we get the well - known transformation expression : @xmath81 the derivative in the jacobian is computed by differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ coslab ] ) with respect to @xmath67 , and can be written in the form @xmath82 writing @xmath83 in the form : @xmath84 we arrive at the following formula for the angular distribution in the lab frame @xmath85 note that this distribution is not unique , because , as shown in fig .  1 , there may be two different cm angles , and two different values of @xmath4 corresponding to the same lab angle @xmath3 .",

    "the results of fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] we have not included pauli blocking in the plots of @xmath96 , but it is included in the total distribution . we see that pauli blocking only is effective in the last case , @xmath98 mev , killing the divergence .",

    "this allows us to perform the integral over @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ integral7drel ] ) using the cm emission angle , by changing variables @xmath99 .",
    "since this is the inverse transformation applied in the previous sections , the jacobian cancels the denominator in eq .",

    "we start by fixing @xmath100 and @xmath101 and define the phase - space integral over the final momenta @xmath102 such that @xmath103 we recall from special relativity that the integral measure @xmath104 is lorentz invariant because of the result , @xmath105 then we can write @xmath106 where the doubly - primed variables refer to the momenta in the cm frame . the cm is defined by @xmath107 .",

    "in this work we have analyzed the angular distribution of 2p-2h final states in the relativistic fermi gas , finding the connections between the cm and lab systems .",
    "theoretical calculations of many - particle emission in neutrino and electron scattering usually rely on the lab frame to be the most appropriate to perform the calculations , since the fermi gas state description is simpler , mainly because pauli blocking necessarily has to be checked in the lab system where the initial nucleons are below the fermi surface",
