    "frustrated magnets have attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "exotic spin liquid phases are of special interest which have been found in some of them @xcite .",
    "a chiral spin liquid phase is an example of such an exotic state of matter in which there are neither quasi long - range nor long - range magnetic orders but a chiral order parameter @xmath2 is nonzero .",
    "existence of such a phase is discussed in context of one - dimensional frustrated quantum magnetic systems@xcite , and it is found experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in larger dimensions ,",
    "one of the systems in which the chiral spin liquid phase can be found at finite temperature is a classical planar ( xy ) helimagnet with @xmath3 symmetry in which the helical structure results from a competition of exchange interactions between localized spins .",
    "critical behavior of spin systems from this class is described by two order parameters . besides the conventional magnetization with @xmath1 symmetry",
    ", one has to take into account also the chiral order parameter that is an ising variable with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this parameter characterizes the direction of the helix twist and distinguishes left - handed and right - handed helical structures .    in three - dimensional helimagnets ,",
    "the phase transitions on the magnetic and the chiral order parameters occur simultaneously .",
    "it was found numerically that the transition is of the weak first order or of the `` almost second order''@xcite type in helical antiferromagnets on a body - centered tetragonal lattice @xcite and on a simple cubic lattice with an extra competing exchange coupling along one axis @xcite .",
    "these systems belong to the same ( pseudo)universality class as , e.g. , the model on a stacked - triangular lattice @xcite and @xmath4 stiefel model @xcite .",
    "the possibility of existence and stabilization of the chiral spin liquid phase by , e.g. , dzyaloshinsky - moria interaction in 3d helimagnets is discussed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the situation is rather different @xcite .",
    "two successive transitions were observed with the temperature decreasing .",
    "the chiral order appears as a result of the first transition that is of the ising type .",
    "another one is the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition driven by the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite .",
    "then , the chiral spin liquid phase arises between these transitions with the chiral order and without a magnetic one .",
    "various 2d systems from the class @xmath3 were investigated numerically ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) : triangular antiferromagnet @xcite , j@xmath5-j@xmath6 model @xcite , the coulomb gas system of half - integer charges @xcite , two coupled xy models @xcite , ising - xy model @xcite and the generalized fully frustrated xy model @xcite . and surely , the most famous of them is the fully frustrated xy model ( ffxy ) introduced by villain @xcite .",
    "this model is of great interest because it describes a superconducting array of josephson junctions under an external transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was found that the temperature of the ising transition @xmath7 is @xmath8 larger than that of the bkt transition for the most of above - named systems @xcite .",
    "korshunov argued @xcite that a phase transition , driven by unbinding of kink - antikink pairs on the domain walls associated with the @xmath0 symmetry , can take place in models similar to 2d ffxy one at temperatures appreciably smaller than @xmath9 ( see also ref .",
    "such a transition could lead to a decoupling of phase coherence across domain boundaries , producing in this way two separate bulk transitions with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out however in ref .",
    "@xcite that these two continuous transitions can merge into a single first order one .",
    "these conclusions do not depend on the particular form of interactions in system as soon as the ground state degeneracy remains the same .",
    "they are confirmed by numerical studies of the models mentioned above @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the situation remains contradictory in 2d helimagnets belonging to the same @xmath3 class as ffxy model and the antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice .",
    "garel and doniach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) considered the simplest helimagnet on a square lattice with an extra competing exchange coupling along one axis that is describing by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where the sum runs over sites @xmath12 of the lattice , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unit vectors of the lattice , the coupling constants @xmath15 are positive . using arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , they concluded @xcite that at low temperatures the vertices are bound by strings , which would inhibit the bkt transition and make the ising transition occur first with the temperature increasing .",
    "kolezhuk noticed @xcite that those arguments are not valid for a helimagnet , and showed that the ising transition temperature is larger than the bkt one at least near the lifshitz point @xmath16 .",
    "it was found by monte carlo simulations in the recent paper @xcite that @xmath17 at @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( i.e. , very near the lifshitz point ) in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite and in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite .    to account for the discordance between results for helical magnets and the general arguments for @xmath3 class",
    ", we perform extensive monte carlo simulations of the model ( 1 ) for different values of @xmath20 .",
    "we obtain reliable results at @xmath21 which show that @xmath22 . on the other hand",
    "the value of @xmath7 close to the lifshitz point is hiding among effects of the finite size scaling and is not accessible for ordinary estimation methods .",
    "we obtain the ising transition temperature from the chiral order parameter distribution and find that @xmath22 near the lifshitz point too . at the same time we find in accordance with results of ref .",
    "@xcite that the specific heat and susceptibilities have subsidiary peaks at low @xmath23 near the lifshitz point",
    ". these are anomalies which are attributed in ref .",
    "@xcite to the ising phase transition .",
    "however , we demonstrate that these anomalies do not signify a continuous phase transition . apparently , their origin is in metastable states which lead also to a peculiar distribution of the chiral order parameter .",
    "we find no such features in the specific heat and susceptibilities far from the lifshitz point ( at @xmath21 ) . as a result",
    "we obtain the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss in sec .",
    "[ model ] the model in more detail and introduce quantities to be found in our calculations .",
    "numerical results are discussed in sec .",
    "in particular , the ising and the bkt transitions are considered in secs .  [ ising ] and [ bkt ] , respectively .",
    "the neighborhood of the lifshitz point and the phase diagram are discussed in sec .",
    "[ phsec ] .",
    "[ conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider the model ( [ ham ] ) of the classical xy magnet on a square lattice .",
    "we set @xmath19 for simplicity and the value of the extra exchange interaction @xmath20 is a variable .",
    "the lifshitz point corresponds to @xmath24 in this notation .",
    "the system has a collinear antiferromagnetic ground state at @xmath25 . to discuss the phase transition from the ( quasi-)antiferromagnetic phase to the paramagnetic one we consider @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see fig .  [ phase ] ) .",
    "the ground state has a helical ordering at @xmath28 .",
    "the turn angle @xmath29 between two neighboring spins along @xmath30 axis is given by @xmath31 at zero temperature .    to discuss the number and the sequence of phase transitions from the ( quasi-)helical phase to the paramagnetic one we consider @xmath32 , 0.5 and @xmath33 corresponding at @xmath34 to angles of commensurate helices @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we use lattices with @xmath38 cites , where @xmath39 is divisible by the size of the helix pitch and it lies in the range from 20 to 120 .",
    "we apply the periodic ( toric ) boundary conditions as well as the cylindrical ones ( i.e. , with the periodic condition along the @xmath40 axis and the free one along the @xmath30 axis ) .",
    "we have found that both conditions lead to the same values of transition temperatures and indexes .",
    "in contrast values of binder s cumulants and the chiral order parameter distribution at @xmath32 depend on boundary conditions as we discuss below in detail .",
    "standard metropolis algorithm @xcite has been used .",
    "the thermalization was maintained within @xmath41 monte carlo steps in each simulation .",
    "averages have been calculated within @xmath42 steps for ordinary points and @xmath43 for points close to the critical ones .",
    "we have used also the histogram analysis technique in which the range of each quantity has been divided into @xmath44 bins .",
    "the bkt transition is driven by the magnetic order parameter for which we use two definitions .",
    "similar to the triangular lattice @xcite , one can introduce a number of sublattices in the case of helix pitches which are divisible by the lattice constant .",
    "then , one can write for the magnetic order parameter @xmath45 where index @xmath46 enumerates @xmath47 sublattices , the sum over @xmath48 runs over sites of the @xmath46-th sublattice , spin @xmath49 is a classical two - component unit vector , and @xmath50 denotes the thermal average .",
    "the second definition of the order parameter is valid both for commensurate and incommensurate helices @xmath51 our calculations show that definitions and lead to the same results away from the lifshitz point .",
    "we have found that @xmath52 shows an anomalous behavior at @xmath53 and we use definition in this case .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that it is useful in numerical discussion of helimagnets to choose parameters of the hamiltonian so that the helix pitch at @xmath34 to be commensurate .",
    "the ising transition is driven by the chiral order parameter defined as @xmath54      we introduce corresponding susceptibilities for all order parameters @xcite @xmath55 the second line in this definition is used below for estimation of critical exponents .",
    "binder s cumulants @xcite are define as @xmath56 we discuss also the cumulant @xmath57 using which the critical exponent @xmath58 can be found by finite - size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "it is useful to introduce the helicity modulus ( or the spin stiffness ) @xcite to discuss the bkt transition that is defined by the increase in the free energy density @xmath59 due to a small twist @xmath60 across the system in one direction ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the direction .",
    "important universal properties of a bkt transition predicted by kosterlitz and nelson @xcite are the jump of the helicity modulus ( [ y = df po dd ] ) from zero at @xmath65 to the value of @xmath66 at @xmath67 and the value of the exponent @xmath68 .",
    "these properties have become standard methods of finding the transition temperature .    as a result of the fact that the exchange couplings along @xmath30 and @xmath40 axes are different ,",
    "the helicity moduli in these directions differ too .",
    "thus , at zero temperature @xmath69 , while @xmath70 .",
    "nevertheless , both @xmath71 and @xmath72 must vanish at the same temperature with the identical value of the jump .",
    "one finds after trivial calculations using eqs .   and that the helicity modulus @xmath72 is expressed via correlation functions and has a common view @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is measured in units of @xmath19 , we set @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . similar calculations give for the helicity modulus in the @xmath30 direction @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it may seem that the last term in eq .",
    "can be discarded as it is done with the corresponding term in eq .   which is equal to zero .",
    "however it is not so because @xmath81 at all @xmath74 whereas @xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 . to demonstrate this",
    "let us apply an infinitesimal twist @xmath86 across the system in the @xmath87 direction , i.e. , let us replace in eq .",
    "@xmath88 by @xmath89 .",
    "one writes in the first order in @xmath86 @xmath90 comparing the last term in eq .   with the chiral order parameter @xmath91 definition and noting that one can use an equivalent definition @xmath92",
    "we conclude that the last term in eq .   is a linear combination of @xmath91 and @xmath93 .",
    "however , @xmath91 and @xmath93 have opposite signs in the case considered .",
    "in particular , their combination @xmath94 in the last term in eq .   is equal to zero at @xmath34 . nevertheless our numerical results presented below show that this combination is not equal to zero at @xmath95 and it can be considered as the ising order parameter at @xmath96 .",
    "then , one see from eq .",
    "that @xmath86 plays the role of the `` chiral '' field and , consequently , @xmath97 ( that is equal in our notation to @xmath98 ) is proportional to the chiral order parameter which is equal to zero at @xmath83 and which is finite at @xmath85 .",
    "to illustrate this consideration we present in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the distribution of @xmath99 for @xmath100 and for various temperatures below @xmath101 , between @xmath9 and @xmath102 , and above @xmath7 ( the values of @xmath7 and @xmath9 are obtained below ) .",
    "the distribution has a gaussian form with the zero expected value @xmath103 .",
    "[ fig12 ] shows the distribution of @xmath104 for @xmath105 and various lattice sizes .",
    "a non - zero expected value of @xmath106 is seen .",
    "one can observe a double - peak structure of @xmath104 distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) for small lattices or at @xmath74 that is close enough to @xmath7 , when the system can tunnel to a configuration with opposite chirality .",
    "the probability of such tunneling is estimated as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a domain wall tension @xcite that is positive at @xmath85 and it vanishes at @xmath109 .",
    "that is why we observe two peaks for small lattices and only one peak for large ones .",
    "quite expectedly , we find the single - peak distribution of @xmath104 at @xmath110 demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .     for @xmath110.,height=264 ]",
    "it should be stressed that the disappearance of the double - peak structure at the critical temperature @xmath111 is a signature of the transition on a lattice with size @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath111 is close to the correct value of the transition temperature for large lattices .",
    "we use this circumstance below in our analysis of the lifshitz point neighborhood .",
    "it should be noted also that we replace in our numerical calculations @xmath98 by @xmath112 at @xmath85 in the last term in eq .   as it is usually done in considerations of order parameters @xcite .",
    "it is done because the order parameter distribution has tails in both positive and negative regions even below the transition temperature .",
    "the value @xmath113 is replaced by @xmath114 in eq .   by the same reason .",
    "we discuss in this section in detail our results for the special case of @xmath100 that corresponds at @xmath34 to 120@xmath115 helical structure with three sublattices .",
    "then , we discuss the phase diagram .",
    "we consider lattices with @xmath116 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 90 , 120 .",
    "the lattice with @xmath117 is also used for estimation of some quantities .",
    "to obtain the ising transition temperature @xmath7 we use the binder cumulant crossing method @xcite .",
    "we find for @xmath116 and 30 the temperature @xmath118 as a function of @xmath119 at which curves @xmath120 intersect for different lattice sizes @xmath121 .",
    "extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit @xmath122 gives the following transition temperature ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] )    @xmath123    the dispersion in the value of @xmath7 obtained for the different lattice sizes @xmath39 gives the error of the transition temperature estimation .",
    "notice that error bars are not shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] and in all figures below if they are smaller than or comparable with symbols size .",
    "a peak in the specific heat shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is found approximately at the same temperature .",
    "for the largest lattices the peak is located in the range of temperature from @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "one expects that this peak corresponds to the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat that is a characteristic of the 2d ising model in which the critical exponent @xmath126 is equal to zero .",
    "insufficient accuracy of our data for the specific heat prevents us from the immediate estimation of @xmath126 .",
    "critical exponents @xmath58 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are obtained by the finite - size scaling theory . to estimate the exponent @xmath58",
    ", we find a maximum of the quantity @xmath129 given by eq .",
    "( [ vp ] ) as a function of lattice size @xmath39 @xcite @xmath130 the fitting presented in fig .",

    "we have found also the universal value of the binder cumulant @xmath141 at the critical temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) that is in agreement with the value @xmath142 observed in the 2d ising model @xcite with periodic boundary conditions .      according to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite",
    "there is no spontaneous magnetization at finite temperature in 2d magnets with short range interactions and a continuous symmetry .",
    "but a quasi - long - range order appears at non - zero temperature due to the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless mechanism @xcite in xy magnets with @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "it is important that as long as we measure the temperature in units of @xmath143 , the universal value of the jump @xmath66 perturbs by the factor of @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is an effective coupling constant .",
    "the competing exchange coupling @xmath20 gives rise to this factor . to obtain it we considered the coloumb - gas representation of the model ( [ ham ] ) using standard duality transformations @xcite . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath146 for the antiferromagnetic phase ( @xmath147 ) , and @xmath148 for the helimagnetic one ( @xmath149 ) .",

    "a few authors have investigated the properties of the binder cumulant for magnetization as an alternative method of the bkt transition temperature estimation @xcite . due to",
    "finite - size corrections this method gives a value for the transition temperature @xmath151 that is slightly larger than the true value @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless this method is useful as it provides an estimation of the bkt transition temperature and an extra evidence of separated transitions ( if one finds that @xmath152 ) . using the binder cumulant crossing method described above we find @xmath153 ( see figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig6 ] ) that is @xmath154 smaller than @xmath155 given by eq .  .",

    "estimating the temperature of the ising critical point by the binder cumulant crossing method , we encounter the anomalous behavior of the chiral order parameter and do not obtain a reliable result .",
    "apparently , it is the reason why the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite base their conclusion about the ising transition on the behavior of the specific heat @xmath183 and susceptibilities @xmath179 .",
    "our results for these quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig163 ] and they are consistent with those of ref .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig163 ] that the chiral susceptibility has a high peak at @xmath184 , while the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility have subsidiary peaks at @xmath184 which grow with the lattice size increasing .",
    "these anomalies at @xmath185 are attributed in ref .",
    "@xcite to the ising transition .",
    "however , we observe that for other @xmath28 the specific heat has only one peak corresponding to the logarithmic divergence which characterizes the ising transition ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath100 ) .",
    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath183 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig163 ] is not normal for the model discussed and it is characteristic of the lifshitz point neighborhood . to account for this anomaly we examine the behavior of the chiral order parameter in detail .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows the chiral order parameter distribution for @xmath100 and @xmath186 .",
    "it looks like a customary order parameter distribution in a system with the second order transition .",
    "in particular , the distribution has a gaussian form below a critical temperature with a peak at @xmath187 ( see the curve for @xmath188 ) . in approaching to the critical temperature",
    "the distribution acquires an appreciable tail ( see curves for @xmath189 and @xmath190 ) .",
    "such a broad distribution leads to a peak in the susceptibility .",
    "the distribution has a peak at @xmath191 above the critical point ( see curves for @xmath192 and @xmath193 ) .",
    "however the picture for the chiral order parameter distribution is quite different close to the lifshitz point , e.g. , at @xmath194 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] the chiral order parameter distribution for @xmath186 and different temperatures .",
    "one can see one gaussian peak at @xmath195 in agreement with the common picture described above .",
    "but a few additional peaks arise at @xmath196 . then , the number and the breadth of peaks depend on the lattice size @xmath39 ( see figs .  [ fig20 ] and [ fig21 ] ) and , what is much more important , on the boundary conditions . for the cylindrical boundary conditions , these peaks are broader and they are accompanied by great number of accessory peaks .",
    "such a distribution of the chiral order parameter is characteristic in the case of @xmath186 to the range of temperature from @xmath197 to @xmath198 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] that at @xmath199 the distribution has a form that is typical for a disordered phase with the peak at zero value of the order parameter .",
    "then , it is clear that the order parameter distribution at @xmath200 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] does not correspond to a critical point of a continuous transition .",
    "apparently , the origin of such a peculiar behavior at @xmath194 are metastable states with different values of the chiral order parameter which prevent the system investigation considerably .",
    "the multi - peak structure of the order parameter distribution leads to a sudden jump of the susceptibility and states intermediate between metastable configurations give rise to the specific heat anomaly .",
    "it should be noted that energy values of the metastable states are close since we observe in our simulations that the energy distribution has a gaussian form even for the largest lattice size .    to estimate the ising transition temperature at @xmath32 we analyze @xmath104 distribution defined in eq .   and discussed in sec .",
    "[ helmod ] . as it is pointed out above , @xmath201 whenever a helical ordering exists .",
    "[ fig22 ] shows that the distribution is not symmetric relative to zero at @xmath202 and @xmath203 , while it is definitely symmetric at @xmath204 .",
