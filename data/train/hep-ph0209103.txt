    ", i will briefly summarize the experimental evidences in favor of the above - mentioned facts ( [ f - mass - limit])([f - nu - e ] ) and i will show that they can be accommodated elegantly in the framework of three - neutrino mixing .",
    "i will not discuss the already well known experimental proof that there are only three active light neutrinos ( fact  [ f - three - active ] above , see ref .",
    "for lack of space i will not review the abundant experimental evidences of the fact  [ f - sbl ] above ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and i will not discuss the status of the four - neutrino mixing hypothesis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which was proposed in order to accommodate also the claim of short - baseline @xmath5 transitions in the lsnd experiment ( see ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis is now disfavored by data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and my opinion is that it should be put under hibernation waiting for its final elimination or resurrection by new data ( especially crucial will be the check of the lsnd result in the miniboone experiment @xcite ) .",
    "all solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , sage @xcite , gallex @xcite , gno @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite ) measured a suppression of the observed rate with respect to the one predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the neutral - current reaction @xmath6 in the sno experiment @xcite , which is equally sensitive to all active neutrino flavors , whose rate is in good agreement with the ssm .",
    "this measurement has marked the triumph of the sno experiment , which measured also a suppression of a factor @xmath7 of the flux of solar @xmath0 s with respect to the ssm through the charged - current reaction @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the neutral - current and charged - current suppressions is a clear and impressive model - independent evidence of transitions of solar @xmath0 s into active @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( fact  [ f - sun ] above ) .",
    "the existence of solar @xmath9 transitions is also supported by the comparison of the different suppressions of the rate of the sno charged - current reaction @xcite and the rate of the elastic scattering reaction @xmath10 , which is mainly sensitive to @xmath0 but has also a small sensitivity to @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) , measured in super - kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite .",
    "let me emphasize also the importance of the homestake experiment @xcite , in which the solar neutrino problem was discovered , and the gallium sage @xcite , gallex @xcite and gno @xcite experiments , which are sensitive to the fundamental flux of @xmath12 neutrinos ( see ref .",
    ". moreover , the results of all neutrino experiments are necessary in order to get information on the neutrino mixing parameters .    the global analysis of all solar neutrino data in terms of @xmath13 performed in ref .",

    "( [ lma ] ) i reported only the boundaries of the so - called lma region ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is currently favored , because it is much larger than other regions ( a low region and three vac regions appear at 99% c.l . ) and it contains the minimum of the @xmath18 ( best fit ) at @xmath19    the limits in eq .",
    "( [ lma ] ) show that the mixing relevant for solar neutrino oscillations is large . however , maximal mixing seems strongly disfavored from the analysis of solar neutrino data in ref .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the results of some other authors @xcite , whereas the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite found slightly larger allowed regions , with maximal mixing marginally allowed .",
    "therefore , it is not clear at present if maximal mixing in solar neutrino oscillations is excluded or not .    in particular , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite found a larger lma region and several allowed low+qvo and vac regions , where qvo indicates the region at @xmath20 where both matter effect and vacuum oscillations are important .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that taking into account only the most recent gallium data ( taken in the period 1998 - 2001 , with improved systematic uncertainty with respect to the earlier data ) the low region is less disfavored with respect to the lma region .",
    "in any case , there are good reasons to believe that the sno experiment has solved the solar neutrino problem proving its neutrino physics origin and the presence of @xmath13 transitions , and that the current data indicate a large mixing .",
    "the final confirmation of the true allowed region will hopefully come from the results of the kamland @xcite or borexino @xcite experiments .",
    "in 1998 the super - kamiokande experiment found model independent evidence of disappearance of atmospheric @xmath1 s @xcite , which is supported by the results of the k2k long - baseline experiment @xcite , of the soudan 2 @xcite and macro @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiment .",

    "let us discuss now the current information on the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath40 .",
    "since the solar neutrino transitions of @xmath0 in @xmath1 or @xmath2 can not be experimentally distinguished because the energy is well below the threshold for charged - current reactions with production of @xmath41 or @xmath42 , solar neutrino oscillations depend only on the elements @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 of the mixing matrix . on the other hand , the hierarchy ( [ dm2hierarchy ] ) of squared - mass differences in the two possible three - neutrino schemes in fig .",
    "[ 3nu ] implies that atmospheric ( and long - baseline ) neutrino oscillations depend only on the elements @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( see ref .",
    "since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are independent , the only quantity that connects solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations is @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , any information on the value of @xmath45 is of crucial importance .    from the results of the chooz long - baseline reactor neutrino experiment @xcite",
    ", it is known that the element @xmath45 of the three - generation neutrino mixing matrix is small @xcite : @xmath50 the results of the chooz experiment have been confirmed by the palo verde experiment @xcite , and by the absence of @xmath0 transitions in the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .    an important consequence of the smallness of @xmath45 is the practical decoupling of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite , which can be analyzed in terms of two - neutrino oscillations with the effective mixing angles @xmath17 and @xmath23 given by @xmath51 neglecting a possible small value of @xmath52 , the mixing matrix can be written as @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in this case ,",
    "solar neutrino transitions occur from @xmath56 to the orthogonal state @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the fractions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 transitions are determined by the value of the atmospheric effective mixing angle @xmath23 .    from the experimental best - fit value @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ atm - best - fit ] ) , we see that solar @xmath0 transform approximately into @xmath61 , which is an equal superposition of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "since the suppression factor of solar @xmath0 s measured in the charged - current sno reaction is about @xmath62 @xcite , the flux of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 on earth is approximately equal .",

    "the sign of @xmath67 can be measured in long - baseline neutrino experiments through matter effects in the earth , which need the participation to the oscillations of @xmath0 through @xmath45 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 have the same neutral - current interaction with matter , whereas @xmath0 has also charged - current interactions ; neutrino oscillations are affected only by the difference of interactions of different flavors ) .    the matrix in eq .",
