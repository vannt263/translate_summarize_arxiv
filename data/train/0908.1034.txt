    "computer simulation is widely regarded as complementary to theory and experiment  @xcite .",
    "the standard approach is to start from one or more basic equations of physics and to employ a numerical algorithm to solve these equations .",
    "this approach has been highly successful for a wide variety of problems in science and engineering . however , there are a number of physics problems , very fundamental ones , for which this approach fails , simply because there are no basic equations to start from .",
    "indeed , as is well - known from the early days in the development of quantum theory , quantum theory has nothing to say about individual events  @xcite . reconciling the mathematical formalism that does not describe individual events with the experimental fact that each observation yields a definite outcome",
    "is referred to as the quantum measurement paradox and is the most fundamental problem in the foundation of quantum theory  @xcite .    in view of the quantum measurement paradox ,",
    "it is unlikely that we can find algorithms that simulate the experimental observation of individual events within the framework of quantum theory .",
    "of course , we could simply use pseudo - random numbers to generate events according to the probability distribution that is obtained by solving the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "however , the challenge is to find algorithms that simulate , event - by - event , the experimental observations of , for instance , interference without first solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "this paper is not about a new interpretation or an extension of quantum theory .",
    "the proof that there exist simulation algorithms that reproduce the results of quantum theory has no direct implications on the foundations of quantum theory : these algorithms describe the process of generating events on a level of detail about which quantum theory has nothing to say  @xcite .",
    "the average properties of the data may be in perfect agreement with quantum theory but the algorithms that generate such data are outside of the scope of what quantum theory can describe .    in a number of recent papers  @xcite",
    ", we have demonstrated that locally - connected networks of processing units can simulate event - by - event , the single - photon beam splitter and mach - zehnder interferometer experiments , universal quantum computation , real einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm ( eprb ) experiments , wheeler s delayed choice experiment and the double - slit experiment with photons .",
    "our work suggests that we may have discovered a procedure to simulate quantum phenomena using event - based , particle - only processes that satisfy einstein s criterion of local causality , without first solving a wave equation . in this paper , we limit the discussion to event - by - event simulations of real eprb experiments .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1a ] , we show a schematic diagram of an eprb experiment with photons ( see also fig .  2 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the source emits pairs of photons .",
    "each photon of a pair propagates to an observation station in which it is manipulated and detected .",
    "the two stations are separated spatially and temporally  @xcite .",
    "this arrangement prevents the observation at station 1 ( 2 ) to have a causal effect on the data registered at station @xmath0 ( 1 )  @xcite .",
    "as the photon arrives at station @xmath1 , it passes through an electro - optic modulator that rotates the polarization of the photon by an angle depending on the voltage applied to the modulator .",
    "these voltages are controlled by two independent binary random number generators .",
    "as the photon leaves the polarizer , it generates a signal in one of the two detectors .",
    "the station s clock assigns a time - tag to each generated signal .",
    "effectively , this procedure discretizes time in intervals of a width that is determined by the time - tag resolution @xmath2  @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the firing of a detector is regarded as an event .",
    "as we wish to demonstrate that it is possible to reproduce the results of quantum theory ( which implicitly assumes idealized conditions ) for the eprb gedanken experiment by an event - based simulation algorithm , it would be logically inconsistent to `` recover '' the results of the former by simulating nonideal experiments .",
    "therefore , we consider ideal experiments only , meaning that we assume that detectors operate with 100% efficiency , clocks remain synchronized forever , the `` fair sampling '' assumption is satisfied  @xcite , and so on .",
    "we assume that the two stations are separated spatially and temporally such that the manipulation and observation at station 1 ( 2 ) can not have a causal effect on the data registered at station @xmath0 ( 1 ) . furthermore , to realize the eprb gedanken experiment on the computer , we assume that the orientation of each electro - optic modulator can be changed at will , at any time .",
    "although these conditions are very difficult to satisfy in real experiments , they are trivially realized in computer experiments .    in the experiment ,",
    "the firing of a detector is regarded as an event . at the @xmath3th event ,",
    "the data recorded on a hard disk at station @xmath1 consists of @xmath4 , specifying which of the two detectors fired , the time tag @xmath5 indicating the time at which a detector fired , and the two - dimensional unit vector @xmath6 that represents the rotation of the polarization by the electro - optic modulator . hence , the set of data collected at station @xmath1 during a run of @xmath7 events may be written as @xmath8 in the ( computer ) experiment , the data @xmath9 may be analyzed long after the data has been collected  @xcite .",
    "coincidences are identified by comparing the time differences @xmath10 with a time window @xmath11  @xcite . introducing the symbol @xmath12 to indicate that the sum has to be taken over all events that satisfy @xmath13 for @xmath1 , for each pair of directions @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the electro - optic modulators ,",
    "the number of coincidences @xmath16 between detectors @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) at station 1 and detectors @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) at station 2 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we emphasize that we count all events that , according to the same criterion as the one employed in experiment , correspond to the detection of pairs .",
    "the average single - particle counts and the two - particle average are defined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . in eqs .",
    "( [ ex ] ) and ( [ exy ] ) , the denominator is the sum of all coincidences .    for later use , it is expedient to introduce the function @xmath25 and its maximum @xmath26      we illustrate the procedure of data analysis and the importance of the choice of the time window @xmath11 by analyzing a data set ( the archives alice.zip and bob.zip ) of an eprb experiment with photons that is publicly available  @xcite",
    ".    in the real experiment , the number of events detected at station 1 is unlikely to be the same as the number of events detected at station 2 .",
    "in fact , the data sets of ref .",
    "@xcite show that station 1 ( alice.zip ) recorded 388455 events while station 2 ( bob.zip ) recorded 302271 events .",
    "furthermore , in the real eprb experiment , there may be an unknown shift @xmath27 ( assumed to be constant during the experiment ) between the times @xmath28 gathered at station 1 and the times @xmath29 recorded at station 2 .",
    "therefore , there is some extra ambiguity in matching the data of station 1 to the data of station 2 .    a simple data processing procedure that resolves this ambiguity consists of two steps  @xcite .",
    "first , we make a histogram of the time differences @xmath30 with a small but reasonable resolution ( we used @xmath31 ns ) .",
    "then , we fix the value of the time - shift @xmath27 by searching for the time difference for which the histogram reaches its maximum , that is we maximize the number of coincidences by a suitable choice of @xmath27 . for the case at hand , we find @xmath32 ns . finally , we compute the coincidences , the two - particle average , and @xmath33 using the expressions given earlier .",
    "the average times between two detection events is @xmath34 ms and @xmath35 ms for alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the number of coincidences ( with double counts removed ) is 13975 and 2899 for ( @xmath32 ns , @xmath36 ns ) and ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ns ) respectively .     as a function of the time window @xmath11 , computed from the data sets contained in the archives alice.zip and bob.zip that can be downloaded from ref .",

    "[ exp1 ] we present the results for @xmath33 as a function of the time window @xmath11 .",
    "first , it is clear that @xmath33 decreases significantly as @xmath11 increases but it is also clear that as @xmath43 , @xmath33 is not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "second , the procedure of maximizing the coincidence count by varying @xmath27 reduces the maximum value of @xmath33 from a value 2.89 that considerably exceeds the maximum for the quantum system ( @xmath44 , see section  [ quantumtheory ] ) to a value 2.73 that violates the bell inequality ( @xmath45 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and is less than the maximum for the quantum system .",
    "finally , we use the experimental data to show that the time delays depend on the orientation of the polarizer . to this end ,",
    "we select all coincidences between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) and make a histogram of the coincidence counts as a function of the time - tag difference , for fixed orientation @xmath40 and the two orientations @xmath48 ( other combinations give similar results ) . the results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fort.7 ] .",
    "the maximum of the distribution shifts by approximately 1 ns as the polarizer at station 2 is rotated by @xmath49 , a demonstration that the time - tag data is sensitive to the orientation of the polarizer at station 2 . a similar distribution of time - delays ( of about the same width )",
    "was also observed in a much older experimental realization of the eprb experiment  @xcite .",
    "the time delays that result from differences in the orientations of the polarizers is much larger than the average time between detection events , which for the data that we analyzed is about 30000 ns . in other words , the loss in correlation that we observe as a function of increasing @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ exp1 ] )",
    "can not be explained by assuming that we calculate correlations using photons that belong to different pairs .    strictly speaking , we can not derive the time delay from classical electrodynamics : the concept of a photon has no place in maxwell s theory .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the time delay mechanism requires dedicated , single - photon retardation measurements for these specific optical elements .",
    "the crucial point is that in any real epr - type experiment , it is necessary to have an operational procedure to decide if the two detection events correspond to the observation of one two - particle system or to the observation of two single - particle systems . in standard",
    "`` hidden variable '' treatments of the epr gedanken experiment  @xcite , the operational definition of `` observation of a single two - particle system '' is missing . in eprb - type experiments",
    ", this decision is taken on the basis of coincidence in time  @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the experimental data shows beyond doubt that a model which aims to describe real eprb experiments should include the time window @xmath11 and that the interesting regime is @xmath43 , not @xmath50 as is assumed in all textbook treatments of the eprb experiment .",
    "indeed , in quantum mechanics textbooks it is standard to assume that an eprb experiment measures the correlation  @xcite @xmath51 which we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ cxy ] ) by taking the limit @xmath50 .",
    "although this limit defines a valid theoretical model , there is no reason why this model should have any bearing on the real experiments , in particular because experiments pay considerable attention to the choice of @xmath11 . in experiments",
    "a lot of effort is made to reduce ( not increase ) @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "according to the axioms of quantum theory  @xcite , repeated measurements on the two - spin system described by the density matrix @xmath52 yield statistical estimates for the single - spin expectation values @xmath53 and the two - spin expectation value @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the pauli spin-1/2 matrices describing the spin of particle @xmath1  @xcite , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are unit vectors .",
    "we have introduced the tilde to distinguish the quantum theoretical results from the results obtained from the data sets @xmath9 .",
    "the quantum theoretical description of the eprb experiment assumes that the system is represented by the singlet state @xmath58 of two spin-1/2 particles , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the horizontal and vertical polarization and the subscripts refer to photon 1 and 2 , respectively . for the singlet state @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "a concrete simulation model of the eprb experiment sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] requires a specification of the information carried by the particles , of the algorithm that simulates the source and the observation stations , and of the procedure to analyze the data . in the following ,",

    "the `` polarization state '' of a particle is completely characterized by @xmath68 , which is distributed uniformly over the whole interval @xmath69 . for the purpose of mimicing the apparent unpredictability of the experimental data , we use uniform random numbers . however , from the description of the algorithm , it will be clear that the use of random numbers is not essential .",

    "bell s theorem states that any local , hidden variable model will produce results that are in conflict with the quantum theory of a system of two @xmath144 particles  @xcite .",
    "however , it is often overlooked that this statement can be proven for a ( very ) restricted class of probabilistic models only .",
    "in fact , bell s theorem does not necessarily apply to the systems that we are interested in as both simulation algorithms and actual data do not need to satisfy the ( hidden ) conditions under which bell s theorem hold  @xcite .",
