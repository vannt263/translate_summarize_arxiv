    "their size growth after @xmath15 is probably dominated by minor mergers : such mergers are expected , and other mechanisms can not easily produce the observed @xmath17 scaling between size growth and mass growth ( bezanson et  al . 2009 ; naab , johansson , & ostriker 2009 ; hopkins et  al .",

    "it is not yet clear how these massive , extremely compact galaxies were formed , and this question has significance well beyond the somewhat narrow context of the size evolution of quiescent galaxies .",
    "the dense centers of massive galaxies today are home to the most massive black holes in the universe ( magorrian et  al .",
    "1998 ) ; have an enrichment history that is very different from that of the milky way ( worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ) ; and probably had a bottom - heavy stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ( conroy & van dokkum 2012 ) .",
    "all these characteristics are the product of processes that took place in the star forming progenitors of @xmath18 massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "furthermore , stars in very dense regions represent only a very small fraction ( @xmath19% ) of the stellar mass in the universe today , but their contribution rises sharply with redshift : depending on the imf , stars inside dense cores with @xmath20   may contribute 10%  20% of the stellar mass density at @xmath21 ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the formation of compact massive galaxies requires large amounts of gas to be funneled in a region that is only 12 kpc in diameter , while preventing significant star formation at larger radii .",
    "galaxy formation models have been able to reproduce the broad characteristics of compact massive galaxies , either by mergers that are accompanied by a strong central star burst ( e.g. , hopkins et  al .",
    "2009b ; wuyts et  al . 2010",

    "these scenarios have testable predictions : for example , if compact massive galaxies formed in mergers then they may be expected to show tidal features .",
    "furthermore , the star formation rates of galaxies , and their evolution in the size - mass plane , can be compared to observations .",
    "observationally , the challenge is to identify these star forming progenitors of compact massive galaxies .",

    "the main observational complication is that typical quiescent galaxies at @xmath4 are structurally very different from typical star forming galaxies ( see , e.g. , franx et  al .",
    "2008 ) . at fixed mass , star forming galaxies are larger , have a lower sersic ( 1968 ) index and , as a result , a much lower central density ( e.g. , franx et  al .",

    "it may be that a subset of the star forming galaxies decrease their size through mergers or `` compaction '' , but it would be difficult to pinpoint which among the many large , star forming galaxies are destined to go through these phases .",
    "a similar problem arises when linking compact , quiescent descendants at @xmath15 to ( lower mass ) star forming galaxies at much higher redshift ( williams et  al .",
    "2014 , 2015 ) : although there may be progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies among small , blue , low mass star forming galaxies at @xmath22 , most of those galaxies will likely follow different paths",

    "it seems plausible that star forming galaxies with the same structure as quiescent galaxies are the direct ancestors of these galaxies , and there may be physical reasons why the most compact star forming galaxies are the most likely to shut off : many proposed quenching and maintenance mechanisms operate most effectively when a significant bulge ( and associated black hole ) has formed ( croton et  al .",

    "this is not surprising , as it is difficult to see how to _ avoid _ a high accretion rate onto the central object in these extremely dense , highly star forming galaxies .    an obvious point of concern is that the presence of agns causes errors in the derived physical parameters of the galaxies . in principle , an agn in a relatively low mass , relatively large , and relatively quiescent galaxy could push the galaxy in the category : the extra light of the agn could be mistaken for star light , increasing the mass ; the combination of a point source with a normal galaxy could be mistaken for a compact bulge - dominated object ; and the hot ir flux from the agn could be mistaken for pah features from star formation .",

    "2014 ) , this is perhaps not surprising .",
    "in this paper we have identified a population of star forming , compact , massive galaxies in the five fields of the candels and 3d - hst surveys .",
    "such objects have been studied previously by barro et  al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014b , 2014a ) and nelson et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and we build on their results . compared to the barro et al .",
    "studies , our selection is more restrictive , focusing only on the most massive and most compact galaxies ; we study an area that is @xmath473 times larger ; and our redshift catalogs make use of the 3d - hst grism spectra for all objects brighter than @xmath32 .",
    "we first confirm the redshifts and masses of the galaxies using keck mosfire and nirspec spectroscopy of 25 compact massive star forming galaxies at @xmath74 .",
    "the gas dynamics suggest that the galaxies are embedded in spatially - extended rotating disks ; this explains the low measured dispersions of a large fraction of the sample and the observed anti - correlation between the disperion and the axis ratio of the galaxies .",
    "support for this interpretation comes from direct measurements of the sizes of the h@xmath8 disks for 10 galaxies ; the fact that this is possible at all from ground - based , seeing - limited data already shows that the gas extends to scales @xmath4741kpc .",
    "the derived sizes of the gas disks , and the fall - off of the rotation curve that we construct for the galaxies , are in very good agreement with recent models for the formation of massive galaxies ( johansson et  al . 2012 ; zolotov et  al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "it is important to note that , in our interpretation , the measured gas velocity dispersions of the galaxies generally do not reflect the true @xmath315 in the stellar body .",
    "we predict that the ( inclination - corrected ) velocities at @xmath475kpc are @xmath476for all galaxies .",
    "this can be tested with adaptive optics - assisted observations of the h@xmath8 line .",
    "there is evidence for broad components in several of the velocity profiles ( see sect .",
    "[ complex.sec ] ) , and these complex profiles may reflect the combined effect of high rotation velocities at small radii and lower velocities at larger radii .",
    "a more direct measurement could come from co line widths , as these likely probe much smaller radii than the h@xmath8 emission ( see , e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "next , we interpret the existence of star forming , compact galaxies at @xmath74 in the context of a simple model for the evolution of galaxies in the size - mass plane .",
    "we describe the average evolution of star - forming galaxies by the simple relation @xmath477 , with the mass evolution proportional to the main sequence star formation rate .",
    "we show that this evolution is a consistent feature in galaxy formation models of hirschmann et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) , wellons et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and zolotov et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and is also seen in observations of number density - matched samples of galaxies ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "2013 ; patel et  al . 2013 ; ownsworth et al .  2014 ) .",
    "as galaxies move along this track their average 3d density within @xmath63 remains approximately constant ( as @xmath415 , it follows that @xmath416 if the density is constant ) .",
    "however , their density within a fixed physical radius increases , as does their projected ( 2d ) density and their velocity dispersion . following many other studies ( e.g. , franx et  al .",
    "2008 ; bell et  al .",
    "2012 ) , we assume that quenching occurs when galaxies reach a threshold in either velocity dispersion or physical density .",
    "we show that this model explains the evolution of the distribution of galaxies in the size - mass plane from @xmath453 to @xmath448 , the redshift range when the number density of massive compact quiescent galaxies increases by nearly an order of magnitude . in the context of this straightforward model , the progenitors of",
    "compact massive star forming galaxies at @xmath478 were simply somewhat less massive and slightly smaller galaxies at @xmath479 .",
    "our study has several important systematic uncertainties .",
    "first , the stellar masses of the galaxies are derived from fitting stellar population synthesis models to the photometry , and these models have not been tested for the extreme galaxies that are under discussion in this paper .",
    "such tests are urgently needed but they are difficult , even for quiescent galaxies and for `` normal '' star forming galaxies in the local universe ( muzzin et  al .",
    "2009b ; conroy 2013 ) .",
    "one interpretation of fig .",
    "[ sigsig.fig]b is that the stellar masses are off by factors up to @xmath7 ; however , as we show in the remainder of sect .",
    "5 the dynamical masses and stellar masses are consistent with each other once orientation effects and the spatial extent of the gas are taken into account .",
    "our final dynamical result ( @xmath480 ; sect .",
    "[ rotcurve.sec ] ) suggests that the contributions of dark matter and gas to the mass within @xmath356kpc are small .",
    "we have assumed a relatively bottom - light chabrier ( 2003 ) imf when deriving stellar masses ; if we assume a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf instead ( see , e.g. , van dokkum & conroy 2010 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012 ; cappellari et  al .",
    "2012 ) we find @xmath481 , and even tighter constraints on the amount of gas and dark matter .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the conversion of light to stellar mass for these dusty , compact star forming galaxies is highly uncertain .",
    "we also note here that the stellar masses are not corrected for the contribution of emission lines to the seds .",
    "these corrections are generally small ( @xmath7% ) .",
    "second , the role of winds and active nuclei in these galaxies is not well understood ( sect .",
    "[ complex.sec ] ) .",
    "they almost certainly influence the measured dynamics and line ratios , but without spatially - resolved data it is very difficult to disentangle the effects of winds , a falling rotation curve , and the spatial distribution of the ionized gas .",
    "third , the fact that the galaxies are all very dusty may imply that we are missing part of the population due to selection effects ( sect .",
    "[ extreme.sec ] ) .",
    "we could be missing galaxies outright ( see fig .  3 in nelson et  al .",
    "2014 ) , or they could be misclassified as less compact , lower mass galaxies if only their outer edges are detected in the currently available data .",
    "another potential effect of the dust is that the stellar population modeling may produce incorrect stellar masses : the modeling uses a screen approximation for dust , whereas in reality the dust and stars are almost certainly mixed .    fortunately , the prospects for addressing these uncertainties are excellent .",
    "adaptive optics - assisted spectroscopic observations with integral field units on 8 m  10 m telescopes can be used to measure kinematics and line ratios on @xmath482kpc scales ( e.g. , newman et  al .",
    "the morphology of the dust and molecular gas emission can be studied with interferometers such as the very large array , the plateau de bure interferometer , and the atacama large millimeter array ( see , e.g. , simpson et  al .",
    "2015 , for impressive early alma results on submm - selected galaxies ) .",
    "these instruments can also measure the kinematics of the molecular gas ( e.g. , tacconi et  al . 2008 ) . on a longer timescale , the james webb space telescope can measure the stellar kinematics of the galaxies , as well as identify and characterize compact galaxies that are entirely obscured in the @xmath5 band ( wang et  al .",
    "finally , the upcoming generation of extremely large ground - based optical / near - ir telescopes is needed to spatially resolve these compact , massive galaxies within their effective radius .",
    "we thank adi zolotov for providing model tracks of galaxies in digital form , and thorsten naab and peter johansson for pointing us to the key figures that show model tracks in their simulations .",
    "the comments from the anonymous referee improved the manuscript , and prompted us to add the three appendices .",

    "the data presented herein were obtained at the w.  m.  keck observatory , which is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "the tidal features around goods - s_30274 and cosmos_11363 are very clear , and several other galaxies also show structure at faint surface brightness .",
    "we fit all galaxies with a single sersic profile , which is an excellent approximation of the average surface brightness profile of the full sample ( see sect .  [ sb.sec ] ) ; however , it is clear that these fits do not capture the full information in the hst images .",
    "as described in sect .",
    "3.4.1 we fit gaussian models to the emission lines .",
    "the fits are done with the emcee code , with the observed 1d spectrum and a noise model as inputs for each galaxy . here",

    "three subpanels are shown .",
    "the top subpanel is identical to the main panel of fig .  5 , and shows the observed spectrum in black along with the best - fitting model in red .",

    "3.1 and sect .",
    "the bottom subpanel is the residual from the fit divided by the noise model .",
    "the residuals are well - behaved , and generally exhibit no indications of poorly subtracted sky lines or other irregularities .",
    "we quantified this by calculating the biweight scatter @xmath483 ( see beers et al .",
    "1990 ) in the distribution of residuals .",
    "the value of @xmath483 deviates by more than @xmath406% from unity in only two cases , uds_35673 and cosmos_11363 .",
    "both galaxies have very high s / n ratio spectra , and the higher than expected residuals are not caused by errors in the noise spectra but by the fact that the velocity distributions are not exactly gaussian .",
    "the average scatter of the remaining 18 galaxies is @xmath484 , which means that the noise models that we use are accurate to @xmath7% .",
    "in sect .  [ rotcurve.sec ] we construct the average rotation curve for star forming compact massive galaxies .",
    "this is done by combining information for 10 different galaxies : all galaxies have approximately the same stellar masses and @xmath30 half - light radii , but they have a wide range of h@xmath8 effective radii . for each galaxy",
    "we measure the galaxy - integrated velocity dispersion and the inclination , and convert these to an inclination - corrected rotation velocity at @xmath357 , where @xmath314 is the half - light radius of the h@xmath8 emission .",
    "the rotation velocities of the galaxies are then plotted versus @xmath314 in fig .",
    "[ kepler.fig ] , and the resulting relation is interpreted as a rotation curve .",
    "here we test whether this method is viable , that is , whether the actual rotation curve of a model galaxy can be reconstructed in this way .",
    "we also test whether we are using the correct conversion constant to go from a galaxy - integrated velocity dispersion to a rotation velocity at the half - light radius of h@xmath8 .",
    "this constant , together with an inclination correction , relates the velocity dispersion @xmath127 to the rotation velocity @xmath315 : @xmath485 ( see eq .",
    "[ siggen.eq ] and eq .",
    "[ correcti.eq ] ) . in the main text we use @xmath486 ,",
    "based on previous studies ( see sect.[gasstars.sec ] ) .",
    "however , these studies did not consider the specific model of a compact , @xmath487-law mass distribution combined with an extended , exponential gas distribution .",
    "we simulated the observations in the following way .",
    "we constructed a model mass distribution that follows a sersic surface density profile .",
    "this mass distribution is characterized by three parameters : the sersic index @xmath85 , the effective radius @xmath488 ( this parameter is equivalent to both @xmath489 and @xmath87 in the main text ) , and the total mass @xmath490 .",
    "we fixed @xmath491kpc and @xmath492 , and for the initial model we set @xmath362 .",
    "apart from a slight rescaling of the effective radius , this model closely matches the actual average stellar mass distribution of the scmgs , if mass traces the @xmath30 light .",
    "the model is shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha_1.fig]a by the grey line .",
    "next , we constructed 10 model galaxies , each with the same mass distribution but with different distributions of the h@xmath8 emission .",
    "the ionized gas is in thin exponential disks , with effective radii ranging from @xmath493kpc ( and hence @xmath494 ) to @xmath495kpc .",
    "four of these model gas distributions are shown by the black lines in fig .",
    "[ alpha_1.fig]a .",
    "the gas disks mimic the derived extended ionized gas of scmgs , with @xmath496 equivalent to the parameter @xmath314 in the main text .",
    "galaxy - integrated velocity profiles were created by integrating the projected velocities along the line of sight and over the full spatial extent of the model galaxies .",
    "the velocities were calculated from the mass profile shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha_1.fig]a and weighted by the h@xmath8 flux . in order to model the observed profiles as closely as possible , we used an inclination of 60@xmath497 ( where @xmath498 is edge - on ) and an instrumental resolution of 60  ( in between the mosfire and nirspec resolution ) .",
    "the velocity profiles of the four model galaxies are shown in panels c - f of fig .",
    "[ alpha_1.fig ] .",
    "as expected they have the classic `` double - horned '' form that is characteristic of rotating disks .",
    "the profile is not the same for all four models even though the mass distribution , and hence the underlying velocity field , is identical in all cases .",
    "the more extended the h@xmath8 distribution is with respect to the mass , the narrower the profile becomes , and the more closely it resembles a gaussian .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the h@xmath8 emission is more weighted toward larger radii , where the rotation velocity is lower .",
    "velocities in excess of @xmath499  are still sampled , but they have relatively low weight and are responsible for the high velocity tails of the profile .    [ [ relation - between - global - dispersion - and - rotation - velocity - at - rr_rm - halpha ] ] relation between global dispersion and rotation velocity at @xmath500 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we fitted gaussian models to the line profiles , just as we do in the data analysis described in the main text .",
    "these gaussian fits are shown by the red curves in panels c - f of fig .",
    "[ alpha_1.fig ] . the width of these gaussians decreases with increasing @xmath501 , as discussed above .",
    "we note here that the actual profile shape is not very well approximated by a gaussian , particular in panels c and d. interestingly , we see hints of double - horned profiles in the data for some of the galaxies ( e.g. , uds_16442 and , particularly , goods - n_774 , which was published in nelson et al .",
    "2014 ) , although the s / n ratio is not high enough to quantify this .    in fig .",
    "[ alpha_2.fig]a these measured galaxy - integrated velocity dispersions are plotted versus the half - light radii of the h@xmath8 disks , after correcting for inclination and instrumental broadening ( open squares ) .",
    "all ten galaxy models are shown , with h@xmath8 effective radii ranging from @xmath502 to @xmath503 .",
    "for comparison , the black curve shows the actual rotation curve of the galaxies .",
    "the squares show the same fall - off as the actual rotation curve , with a roughly constant multiplicitative offset .",
    "the solid squares are obtained by dividing the measured dispersions by 0.8 , which is the value of @xmath504 that we used in the analysis of sect .",
    "[ rotcurve.sec ] .",
    "they are in almost perfect agreement with the black curve , demonstrating that it is possible to reconstruct the average rotation curve of scmgs with our method .",
    "the analysis is generalized in fig .",
    "[ alpha_2.fig]b , where we show the value of @xmath8 as a function of the ratio of the effective radius of h@xmath8 and the effective radius of the mass .",
    "we repeated the analysis for different assumed mass profiles , ranging from exponential ( @xmath505 ; dotted ) to an @xmath487 law ( @xmath362 ; solid ) .",
    "the ratio between dispersion and rotation velocity at @xmath506 is remarkably constant : it does not vary appreciably either with @xmath333 or with @xmath85 .",
    "we conclude that the assumed value of @xmath507 is reasonable for the mass and h@xmath8 profiles discussed in this paper ."
