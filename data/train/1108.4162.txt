    "ly@xmath0 photons have been widely applied to study the physics of the universe at redshifts from 2 to 8 .",
    "the redshifted ly@xmath0 photons carry the information of the photon source , the halo surrounding the source , and the igm at early universe .",
    "the optical afterglow of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) has been modeled as the red wing of ly@xmath0 photon absorption , and used to estimate the column number density of neutral hydrogen of igm at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the transmitted flux of qso absorption spectrum at redshift @xmath9 consists of complete absorption troughs separated by spikes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spikes have been explained as ly@xmath0 photons leaking at low density areas ( e.g. @xcite ) , and used to probe the turbulent behavior of igm at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the last but not the least , searching for redshifted ly@xmath0 photons from star forming galaxies at high redshift is believed to be a basic tool to explore the epoch of reionization ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to have a complete understanding of the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons caused by their resonant scattering with neutral hydrogen atoms .    the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in a medium consisting of neutral hydrogen atoms has been extensively studied either analytically or numerically . yet",
    ", there are very few solutions on the time - dependent behavior of ly@xmath0 photon transfer @xcite .",
    "all other analytical solutions are time - independent based on the fokker - planck equation @xcite",
    ". time - independent solutions are important but can only be used to describe the  limiting asymptotic behaviors \" of the radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "they tell us nothing about the time scales of the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "these time - independent solutions can not describe the wouthuysen - field ( w - f ) effect @xcite , which is essential for the 21 cm emission and absorption of neutral hydrogen at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is because the fokker - planck approximation would miss the detailed balance relation of resonant scattering , which is necessary to keep the w - f local thermalization @xcite .",
    "numerical method based on the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is also popular in solving the transfer of resonant photons ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are very few works dealing with time - dependent problems . for instance , the time - scale of the w - f local thermalization is still absent in these studies",
    ".    time - dependent behavior of the ly@xmath0 photon transfer is especially important to understand observations of ly@xmath0 photons at high redshifts .",
    "first , either the life time or the age of photon sources at high redshift is generally short .",
    "second , the optical depth of the igm or the halo cloud around the sources is generally large . if the time scale of the transfer of ly@xmath0 photons is comparable to the life - time or the age of the photon source , the  limiting asymptotic state \" will never be approached .",
    "one more problem is caused by the cosmic expansion , of which the time scale is short at high redshifts .",
    "when the time scale of the cosmic expansion is comparable to that of the resonant photon transfer in optically thick medium , time - independent solutions probably do not exist .",
    "recently , a state - of - the - art numerical method based on the weno scheme has been introduced to solve the integro - differential equation of the radiative transfer of resonant photons @xcite .",
    "it reveals many interesting features of the transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in an optically thick medium , which can not be seen with the time - independent solutions of the fokker - planck approximation .",
    "for instance , it shows that the time scale of the formation of the w - f local thermal equilibrium actually is short , only about a few hundred times of the resonant scattering .",
    "the double peaked frequency profile of ly@xmath0 photon can not be described by time - independent analytical solutions unless the optical depth of @xmath10 photons is as large as about 10@xmath3 .",
    "this result directly indicates the need of time - dependent solutions .",
    "the weno algorithm of the integro - differential equation of the radiative transfer is fine , but like other high order scheme with fixed grid without artificial - viscosity , the computation time is much more than the monte carlo method .",
    "therefore , the weno method would be not easy to deal with cases of medium with very high optical depth .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold .",
    "the first is to show that the monte carlo simulation method can properly match the results of weno method on the time - dependent features of moderate optical depth .",
    "secondly , we study the time - dependent solutions of ly@xmath0 photons escaped from optically thick medium .",
    "we will not work on specific objects , but focus on the general time dependent features which will affect the observability of the ly@xmath0 sources embedded in , or behind optically thick medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the basic models we will study .",
    "the monte carlo simulation method and its tests for time - dependent problems of ly@xmath0 photon transfer in an optically thick medium will be given in section 3 .",
    "the major results of the time - dependent solutions of ly@xmath0 photon emission in the dla and igm models are given in  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "problems of absorption by optically thick medium are presented in  6 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "all the relevant formulae of the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons and the details of mc simulation are presented in appendix .",
    "we study the time dependent transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in two typical models of neutral hydrogen @xmath11 medium .",
    "the first one is the so - called dla ( damped ly@xmath0 system ) halo model , in which a source is surrounded by a static spherical halo of physical radius @xmath12 , consisting of homogeneously distributed neutral hydrogen with number density @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the second one is a source at redshift @xmath15 located in homogeneously hubble expanding igm , of which the density and temperature are given by the parameters of the concordance @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "we call it igm model . the radiative transfer equation of the two models",
    "are given in appendix a.    in order to compare with the weno solutions , for the dla halo model we use dimensionless time and radial coordinate , defined , respectively , as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath12 are the physical variables of time and radial coordinate , and @xmath19 is the cross section of scattering at the resonant frequency @xmath20 s@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the time and length in the units of mean free flight - time and mean free path of photon @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath22 actually is equal to the optical depth of the spherical halo from @xmath23 to @xmath22 at frequency @xmath10 . for a signal propagating in the radial direction with the speed of light",
    ", we have @xmath24 .    as usual , in frequency space",
    ", we use variable @xmath25 , where @xmath26 hz is the doppler broadening at frequency @xmath10 by thermal motion @xmath27 of gas with temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the variable @xmath28 is then the deviation of frequency @xmath29 from @xmath10 in units of the doppler broadening .    with the dimensionless variables ,",
    "the specific number intensity of photons is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 being the direction relative to the radial vector @xmath22 .",
    "thus , all the solutions of @xmath32 do not refer to a specific density @xmath33 and size @xmath12 ( see appendix ",
    "this helps to see the common features of the dla halo model .",
    "the optical depth of a halo or cloud with column density @xmath34 at frequency @xmath28 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scattering cross section , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the normalized voigt profile given by is different from the one used in some literatures by a factor @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , the expressions for mean flight time , mean free path and optical depth may be different by a factor of @xmath39 . ]",
    "@xmath40 where the parameter @xmath41 is the ratio of the natural to the doppler broadening . for the ly@xmath0 line , @xmath42 .",
    "the profile eq.(2 ) describes the joint effect of the gaussian distribution of the velocity of neutral hydrogen atom and the lorentz profile of cross section in the rest frame of the atom . for an expanding ( or collapsing ) halo or turbulent gas cloud",
    ", the bulk velocity of the gas might be larger than the thermal velocity @xmath27 .",
    "even in this case , the doppler or thermal broadening is still important , as it is the key factor leading to a local thermal equilibrium of ly@xmath0 photons ( the w - f effect ) .    in an optically thick spherical cloud ,",
    "most time - dependent behaviors can be described by two time - dependent distribution functions : 1 . )",
    "angularly averaged , @xmath43-rescaled , specific number intensity @xmath44 , and 2 . )",
    "@xmath43-rescaled number flux @xmath45 , which describes the photons escaped from a spherical halo of radius @xmath22 .",
    "the equations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given in appendix eqs.(a1 ) and ( a2 ) .",
    "for the igm model , we use the physical variable @xmath18 and @xmath12 because of the specific cosmological model we adopted .",
    "the temperature of igm is taken as @xmath48 k and the parameter @xmath49 [ see eq.(a3 ) ] , which describes the hubble expanding , is equal to @xmath50 in the concordance @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "we use monte carlo ( mc ) method to simulate @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the previous section",
    ". most monte carlo codes of simulating time - independent solutions of radiative equation can easily be modified to deal with time - dependent problems .",
    "if the feedback of photon transfer on the parameters of neutral hydrogen is negligible , the radiative transfer equations are linear with respect to @xmath53 , and thus to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus , linear superposition of the solutions of the sources is valid .",
    "the time - dependent solutions can simply be given by a weighted summation over the results of a single flash .",
    "the weight of the summation is proportional to the time - dependent flux of the light source .",
    "we will employ the same mc algorithm as used in @xcite , of which some of the details are given in appendix b and c. the major modification from the earlier methods , such as @xcite , is to record the time at each collision of the photon , and to take snapshots of photon distribution in spatial and frequency space based on these time stamps .",
    "thus , the time - dependent solutions @xmath46 and @xmath47 of an arbitrary source can be given by a synthesis of the fluxes at different epochs from a single flash source .",
    "as a test of the mc method , we calculate the flux @xmath54 at the outer boundary @xmath55 of a dla halo . this result",
    "is shown in fig . 1 , in which the curves are the mc results with parameter @xmath56 , 2000 and 3000 .",
    "they show typical double - peaked profile .",
    "the curves of @xmath57 and 3000 actually are the same .",
    "the overlapping indicates that @xmath54 is already at the limiting asymptotic state , or saturated for time @xmath58 . in fig .",

    "2 also plots @xmath76 at time @xmath56 , but for @xmath77 , 90 , 95 , 98 , 99 .",
    "we see that all the curves of @xmath78 are almost flat in the range of @xmath79 .",
    "it means that the frequency distribution of photons is thermalized near the resonant frequency @xmath10 .",
    "that is , the frequency distribution is of boltzmann @xmath80 , where @xmath14 is the kinetic temperature of neutral hydrogen gas in the halo .",
    "this is the w - f local thermalization @xcite .",
    "2 tells us that the w - f local thermalization is achieved by resonant scattering even at @xmath81 . yet",
    "photons at the outermost layer @xmath82 have not yet been thermalized , as the optical thin layer does not carry enough number of scattering .",
    "this result is similar to the weno solution @xcite .",
    "the second test is on the @xmath83-@xmath84 relation , where @xmath85 are frequencies of the two peaks of the double - peaked profile as shown in fig . 1 ,",
    "and @xmath84 is the optical depth parameter defined in eq.(1 ) .",
    "this relation has been studied by many time - independent solutions based on the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the major conclusion is the so - called @xmath86-law , i.e. @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a constant of order 1 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath89-law is available only when the optical depth @xmath84 is very large .",
    "however , the @xmath85-@xmath84 relation available for various @xmath84 has not been calculated until very recently .",
    "it may be due to the absence of proper numerical solver of the integro - differential equation of resonant photon transfer in optical thick medium .",
    "the weno solver provided the first @xmath85-@xmath84 relation of dla halo with moderate and high optical depth .     vs. @xmath90 given by mc simulation ( data points ) of a dla halo with optical depth @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 is taken to be @xmath91(bold line ) and @xmath92 ( light line ) . the dashed straight line of @xmath93-@xmath94 with slope 1/3 is to show the @xmath86-law.,width=302 ]    the @xmath85-@xmath84 relation given by the mc simulation is presented in fig .",
    "3 , which shows that the @xmath89-law is significantly deviating from the mc results when @xmath95 , where the optical depth is smaller than @xmath96 at @xmath97 .",
    "this result is the same as the weno solution . in fig .",
    "3 the parameter range of [ @xmath98 $ ] is larger than that of weno solution [ fig . 4 of @xcite ] .    in the range @xmath99 ,",
    "the @xmath83-@xmath84 relation is almost flat with @xmath100 .",
    "it is because the double - peaked profile is from photons stored in the frequency range of @xmath79 and in the local thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the positions of the two peaks , @xmath101 , actually is about the same as the frequency range of the local thermalization .",
    "the frequency width @xmath102 of the local thermal equilibrium state is determined by the doppler broadening , and very weakly dependent on @xmath84 .",
    "thus , once the photons in local thermal equilibrium state are dominant , we always have @xmath103 .",
    "this point can also be seen with figs . 1 and 2 , in which the positions of the two peaks are kept to be @xmath104 despite that the intensity of the flux increases with time significantly .",
    "when @xmath105 , the curves of @xmath83 are no longer determined by one variable @xmath106 , instead by variables @xmath41 and @xmath84 , separately .",
    "the value of @xmath83 shows a quick drop to zero at @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "the w - f thermal equilibrium can not be established in halos with small optical depth @xmath111 , and therefore , photons from these halos do not have double - peaked profile .",
    "since thermalization will erase all frequency features within the range @xmath102 , the double - peaked structure does nt retain information of the photon frequency distribution within @xmath79 at the source .",
    "it is impossible to probe the frequency profile for @xmath79 ly@xmath0 photons of the source from the escaped ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "this property can also be used as a test of simulation code .",
    "that is , the simulation results should be independent of the profile of ly@xmath0 emission from the sources , only if the profile is non - zero within the range @xmath79 , i.e. it should not matter whether the source is monochromatic , or has a finite width around @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that the spatial transfer of ly@xmath0 photon in optically thick halo is not simply a brownian random walk .",
    "the time scale of ly@xmath0 photon escape from optically thick halo is much shorter than that of brownian diffusion . it is because the spatial transfer depends on the diffusion in frequency space .",
    "this is the so - called `` single longest excursion '' process @xcite .",
    "however , earlier estimates of the escaping time scale based on `` single longest excursion '' can not describe the details of the time - dependent behavior of photons escaping from optically thick medium .    if the central source of a dla halo is assumed to be a photon flash , the time dependence of the luminosity of the photon source is proportional to @xmath112 . without scattering ,",
    "the luminosity at the boundary of the halo with size @xmath22 should still be a delta function as @xmath113 , i.e. it is also a flash , but with a retarded time @xmath22 , which is the time needed for a freely streaming photon from the center to the edge of the halo with speed of light . considering the effect of resonant scattering , the luminosity of escaped photons will no longer be a flash . the light curve of the luminosity from such a source for a halo with size @xmath114 and @xmath115 is shown in fig .",
    "4 , in which @xmath116 is the flux integrated over all frequencies of escaped photons .",
    "photons in a dla halo model of @xmath117 with optical depth @xmath118 .",
    "one photon is supposed to be emitted from a central source at time @xmath119 , i.e. the integral of the light curve is equal to 1 .",
    ", width=302 ]    fig .",
    "4 shows that the light curve lasts from time @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "the peak of light curve @xmath122 is at @xmath123 , and the time duration @xmath124 of @xmath125 , is also about @xmath126 . since the source of photons does not contain any time scale , both the numbers @xmath127 and @xmath124 are from the size or optical depth of the halo .",
    "the time scale @xmath127 means that the retarded time of the escaping of photons from the halo is as large as @xmath128 or 10@xmath84 .",
    "the amount @xmath124 means that the time - distribution of the escaped photons are significantly spread out from a delta function @xmath112 to @xmath129 .    without resonant scattering",
    ", photons emitted from the source will escape from the halo at time @xmath130 .",
    "with resonant scattering , the majority of photons emitted from the source will not escape from the halo until time @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , a huge number of resonant photons is stored in the halo .",
    "the resonant nature of ly@xmath0 photon scattering let the photons to stay in the halo with a time scale equal to 10 times of the optical depth @xmath84 of the halo .    in our model",
    "the destruction processes of ly@xmath0 photons , such as the two - photon process , are not considered , and dust absorption is ignored too . the number of photons is conserved .",
    "thus , we have @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the light curve , @xmath133 of fig .",
    "4 can be understood as the probability distribution of the time of ly@xmath0 photon escaped from a @xmath114 halo . with dimensionless variables , the curve of fig .",
    "4 is also the probability distribution of the total length of the path of a photon transferring from @xmath23 to @xmath114 . in this context , @xmath127 and @xmath124",
    "can be used as the most probable length of the path , and the variance of the distribution , respectively . considering that the most probable path length @xmath127 and the variance @xmath124 have the same order ,",
    "the spatial transfer of ly@xmath0 photon in optically thick halo essentially is still a random process of diffusion .    the light curve of a flash source ( fig .",
    "4 ) can easily be generalized to arbitrary sources . considering",
    "the total flux is linearly dependent on sources , the total flux @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 where @xmath133 is the curve of fig . 4 , and @xmath136 is the time - dependent ly@xmath0 photon flux of the sources .      for a source with stable luminosity of ly@xmath0 photons , escape coefficient of ly@xmath0 photons emergent from a halo with size @xmath22 can be calculated by @xmath137 if the luminosity of sources is normalized .",
    "since the number of ly@xmath0 photons is conserved , the total number of escaped photons should be equal to the total number of emitted photons by the source when a stable state is reached .",
    "thus , the escape coefficient of a stable source should reach to 1 when @xmath21 is large enough .",
    "however , before the system approaches to stable state , the escape coefficient @xmath138 can be much less than one .",
    "we have calculated the time dependent solution of the escape coefficient @xmath139 for a stable photon source with unlimited life time located at the center of the halo with optical depth @xmath140 . at time @xmath141 , the escape coefficient @xmath142 . if we define the time scale @xmath143 of reaching saturated or stable state as @xmath144 , it yields @xmath145 , or @xmath146",

    "it shows that the escape coefficient is always less than 1 if @xmath160 . in this case , the time scale of the escaping of ly@xmath0 photons in @xmath161 halo is much larger than the life time of the source , and therefore , photons emitted within the time duration @xmath119 to @xmath162 are fully spread over a time scale @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the escape coefficient of a source with short life time is always much less than 1 when the dla halo is optically thick .",
    "this mechanism would be important for understanding the observable features of high redshift objects such as grbs or first stars .",
    "even when dust absorption is negligible , the escape coefficient can be small , even very small , when the age of the object is small .",
    "it is interesting to see that although different curves of fig . 5 correspond to very different @xmath164 , all the curves with @xmath160 approach their maximum at about the same time @xmath165 .",

    "the mechanism of the escaping of ly@xmath0 photons from expanding opaque igm at high redshift is different from that of dla halos . for the former , besides the diffusion in frequency space caused by the the resonant scattering , we should also consider the frequency redshift caused by cosmic expansion .",

    "for a source at redshift @xmath2 surrounded by the igm of @xmath48k of the expanding universe .",

    "7 presents the time - dependent solutions of the escape coefficient @xmath195 for sources at redshift @xmath196 surrounded by the igm of hubble expanding universe .",
    "the number density of neutral hydrogen is given by the cosmology parameters of the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "the igm is assumed to be not reionized yet .",
    "the time duration @xmath197 of photon source has been explored with values @xmath198 , and @xmath199 years . for sources at @xmath196 , @xmath197 can not be larger than the age of the universe @xmath200 years .",
    "the source is starting to emit photons at @xmath201 .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "7 look very similar to those of fig .",

    "5 , replacing the optical depth of the dla halo with the gunn - peterson optical depth ( eq.(a5 ) ) of the expanding igm at @xmath15 . in fig . 7 , all the short life time curves with @xmath202 years reach their maximum at about the same time @xmath203 years , which is the time scale of ly@xmath0 photon escape from the gunn - peterson trough in an expanding igm at @xmath2 .",
    "one can then conclude that the escape coefficient of sources with life time less than @xmath204 years should always be less than 1 , even without dust absorption .",
    "the curve of the shortest life time ( @xmath192 ) of fig .",
    "7 can be thought to represent the light curve of a flash source in igm model , like that of fig . 4 for dla model . the curve of @xmath192 of fig .",
    "7 has a long tail .",
    "the long tail basically is a power law of @xmath18 , and is a joint result of radiative transfer and hubble expansion velocity field . as mentioned in  4.1 , for the light curve of fig .",
    "4 , the maximum @xmath127 and variance ( or the width of the light curve ) @xmath205 are about the same . yet",
    ", the power law long tail leads to the maximum @xmath206 of the curve of @xmath192 of fig .",
    "7 to be much less than the width of the curve . since the suppression of escape coefficient is mainly given by the width of the light curve .",
    "therefore , the power law long tail of fig .",
    "7 implies that the stable state of @xmath207 takes a much longer time to approach , or can never be approached within the age of the universe .",
    "although fig .",
    "7 shows that the escape coefficient of sources with @xmath208 years is larger than those of sources with @xmath209 , it does not mean that the former is easier to be observed than the later .",
    "this point can more clearly be revealed with the time - dependent solution of surface brightness .",
    "we calculate the mean surface brightness @xmath210 defined as the flux divided by the averaged area of the source , where @xmath211 is the projected distance to the source on the sky at which a photon escapes .",
    "thus , @xmath212(t ) is the mean of the area at time @xmath18 on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "8 , which plots the @xmath169 for sources with ly@xmath0 luminosity ( erg / sec ) and life time ( year ) paired as : ( @xmath213 , 10@xmath214 ) , ( @xmath215 , 10@xmath193 ) , ( @xmath216 , 10@xmath194 ) , ( @xmath217 , 10@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath218 , 10@xmath153 ) , and ( @xmath219 , 10@xmath154 ) .",
    "that is , all sources emit the same amount of @xmath220 ly@xmath0 photons in their whole life span .",
    "the sources start to emit at time @xmath201 .",
    "k in expanding universe .",
    "the source is assumed to be located at redshift @xmath196 , and emitting a total of @xmath221 ly@xmath0 photons from time @xmath222 .",
    "the time duration of the emission of the source is taken to be @xmath223 , and @xmath199 years , respectively from top down using color codes cyan , green , yellow , orange , and red .",
    "the flash source ( @xmath224 years ) is drawn with black dashed line.,width=302 ]    fig .",
    "8 has two remarkable features .",
    "first , the four curves of ( @xmath213 , 10@xmath214 ) , ( @xmath215 , 10@xmath193 ) , ( @xmath216 , 10@xmath194 ) , and ( @xmath217 , 10@xmath3 ) are almost the same .",
    "the common curve has a maximum at @xmath225 year and then starts decaying with a power law @xmath226 .",
    "the time scales of the maximum and the power law tail are about the same as that of the light curve of fig . 7 with @xmath192",
    "therefore , for sources with life time less than @xmath225 years , the surface brightness is only dependent on the total number @xmath227 of ly@xmath0 photons emitted from the source , regardless of their life time .",
    "this is because the photons should wait for about @xmath228 years before their escaping from the igm .",
    "the stored photons are locally thermalized , and therefore , the information of the `` age '' of the photons emitted at time @xmath229 will be forgotten during the thermolization .",
    "this property actually is also valid for the sources of ( @xmath218 , 10@xmath153 ) , and ( @xmath219 , 10@xmath154 ) .",
    "for these two cases , the total numbers of ly@xmath0 photon emitted in @xmath230 years are smaller , respectively are @xmath231 , and @xmath232 and therefore , their @xmath169 at @xmath233 is less than that of @xmath234 by factors 10 and 100 , respectively in the figure .",
    "the curves of @xmath235 years become scalable from @xmath236 myr .",
    "the @xmath237 yr curve is just starting to move away from the flash source solutions .",
    "the relaxation time looks to be around @xmath238myr when the flash source reaches its maximum .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimate from @xcite where the relaxation time is @xmath239 myr for our chosen redshift ( @xmath2 ) and temperature ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "8 shows various scaling relations .",
    "for example , for the flash source of @xmath241yr , the asymptotic slope sets in from @xmath236 myr as a result of radiative transfer in hubble expansion velocity field . for the @xmath242 yr curve in the figure , another straight part sets in from 1 myr to 50 myr even before the asymptotic slope is reached , as a joint result of photon emission , photon transfer and hubble expansion .",
    "these time scales are comparable to the possible life time of the sources , which was previously pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the second feature of fig . 8 is the monotonous decrease of @xmath169 when @xmath18 is large , regardless of the life time of the source .",
    "it is very different from all the curves of fig . 5 , which will approach a stable or saturated state if the life time of the source is long enough .",
    "for any sources in expanding neutral igm , the mean surface brightness @xmath169 does not approach a saturated or stable state .",
    "in other words , a time - independent solution of the surface brightness does nt exist in the igm model .",
    "this is simply because the increase of volume of the expanding igm , which stores ly@xmath0 photons , is faster than the number of ly@xmath0 photons redshifted to frequency @xmath243 .",
    "this feature is similar to the evolution of ionized halos around a uv photon source in expanding universe .",
    "the ionized radius can never approach a stable state required by a strmgren sphere , because the increase of the ionized radius is always lower than the comoving velocity@xcite .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "8 there is no flat section for every curve .",
    "the maximum of the surface brightness of a ly@xmath0 photon source with luminosity @xmath4 at @xmath2 scales approximately as @xmath244  erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 arcsec .",
    "we should emphasize that the maximum can be reached only for sources with age equal to about 10@xmath3 years .",
    "the surface brightness would be less than the maximum when the source age is younger or older than 10@xmath3 years . that is , in term of surface brightness , a stable source will yield a time - dependent curve .",
    "a typical problem of ly@xmath0 absorption at high redshift is the red damping wing , or hi damping wing of high redshift sources .",
    "the optical afterglow of grbs at high redshifts has shown this feature(e.g .",
    "we calculate the time - dependence of the red damping wing of a dla halo with radius and optical depth @xmath84 to be @xmath245 .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the central photon source is assumed to be flat with flux equal to one .",
    "if the source starts to emit photons at time @xmath119 , photons without undergoing scattering or collisions will escape from the halo at time @xmath246 .",
    "the profiles of red damping wing at times later than @xmath247 are plotted in fig .",
    "9 , in which we take @xmath248 , where @xmath249 , 0.5 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 50 .     with size @xmath22 and optical depth @xmath84 set to be @xmath250 .",
    "the central source starts to emit photons with a flat spectrum at @xmath119 .",
    "the profiles of the red damping wing are shown at times @xmath248 , where @xmath251 is the time of free flight from @xmath23 to @xmath22 , and @xmath252 is taken to be @xmath253 , 0.5 , 2 , 5 , 10 , and 50 , respectively from bottom up using color code violet , blue , orange , yellow , green , and cyan .",
    "the black curve , which is almost the same as the violet curve , is given by the voigt absorption , i.e. @xmath254 and @xmath255 is from eq.(1).,width=321 ]    fig .",
    "9 shows that the red damping wing at time @xmath256 can be well described by a voigt profile @xmath254 , where @xmath255 is given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "therefore , it would be fully reasonable to fit the red damping wing of grb s optical afterglow with a voigt absorption profile , because the red damping wing is measured only a few hours or a few days after the grb explosion , the time @xmath21 is very close to @xmath247 .",
    "even when @xmath257 ( the blue line in fig.9 ) , the red damping wing can still be approximately fitted by a voigt profile .",
    "however , the fitting at time @xmath257 will yield a smaller @xmath84 than that of the fitting at @xmath258 .",
    "therefore , the column density of hi atoms given by the fitting at @xmath257 is underestimated .",
    "the red damping wing at @xmath259 shows a shoulder with frequency similar to that given by fig .",
    "3 with parameters @xmath110 and @xmath150 . therefore",
    ", the shoulder is from the stored resonant photons . fig .",
    "9 shows that the curve of red damping wing has become saturated at time @xmath260 .",
    "this is larger than the time scale @xmath261 shown in fig .",
    "4 . it is because the photons with frequency @xmath262 of the continuous spectrum can also be stored .",
    "according to the redistribution function ( a6 ) , the probability of transferring a @xmath263 photon to @xmath79 is larger than that from @xmath79 to @xmath263 , and therefore , in frequency space the net effect of the resonant scattering is to bring photons of the continuous spectrum background to become ly@xmath0 .",
    "more photons be stored leads to the larger time scale of the saturation .",
    "the problem of the red damping wing for the igm model is very different from that of the dla model .",
    "if the frequency spectrum of source is flat , cosmic redshift will continuously provide ly@xmath0 photons from blue side of the spectrum .",
    "since the time scale of the w - f thermalization is much shorter than the time scale of the cosmic expansion , the photons moved into the frequency range @xmath264 from @xmath265 is quickly thermalized .",
    "thus , a huge number of thermalized photons is stored in the frequency range @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this process marks the difference between the igm and the dla models , and also the difference between our igm model and igm models of some others @xcite , in which the source emits only @xmath10 photons .     starts to emit photons with flat spectrum at @xmath201 into igm of t=100k .",
    "the curves correspond to @xmath266 , 10@xmath3 , @xmath267 , and 10@xmath153 years , respectively from bottom up using color codes blue , orange , cyan , and black .",
    "the red line is given by pure absorption @xmath254 where @xmath255 is from eq.(c1 ) .",
    ", width=294 ]    fig .",
    "10 shows the red damping wings of a source in t=100 k igm at @xmath2 with age @xmath268 , 10@xmath3 , @xmath267 , and 10@xmath153 years . when the time is less than @xmath269 year , the ly@xmath0 photons have not been significantly stored yet , and the profile of red damping wing is about the same as a pure absorption , which has been addressed by @xcite .",
    "once the time is larger than @xmath270 year , the stored photons yield a shoulder at peak frequency @xmath271 .",
    "10 also shows that the profile of the red damping wing seems not yet to approach a saturated or time - independent state at @xmath272 years .",
    "the time - dependent behaviors in physics and frequency spaces of the ly@xmath0 photons emergent from optically thick medium have been extensively studied with monte carlo method .",
    "the first conclusion is that time - dependent solutions are essential not only for strong time dependent sources like grbs , but also for stable sources , especially when the cosmic expansion needs to be considered .",
    "cosmic expansion makes the radiation transfer equation not invariant with respect to the transformation of time shift .",
    "consequently , the radiative transfer equation does nt have time - independent solutions in principle .",
    "time - dependent behavior are essential .    with the model of igm in the hubble expanding universe",
    ", we show that the time - dependence of the brightness of a stable source at high redshift is like that of the light curve of an `` explosion '' , i.e. in the first phase , the surface brightness is increasing and approaching a maximum , and then , in the second phase , it decays monotonously . although our calculation is only based on a model source at redshift @xmath15 , we believe that the feature of the nonexistence of a time - independent solution , or the nonexistence of a saturated state of the surface brightness by igm scattering , would be hold for various high redshift sources",
    ".    the igm model may be too simple and ideal .",
    "many effects have not been considered , such as the effects given by the inhomogeneity of the hi density distribution , the nonuniform ionization , the bulk velocity , the wind and the turbulence of the igm field , and the observational aperture , etc .",
    "however , one point seems to be clear that under these circumstances , stable solutions will not exist .",
    "all these effects should be studied with time - dependent solutions of the ly@xmath0 photon transfer .",
    "since some high redshift ly@xmath0 emitters have already been observed , static solutions may not be enough to understand these observations .    for the dla model , the saturated state or the time - dependent state , does exist .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to find this state directly by time - independent solution .",
    "however , time - independent solutions can not tell us the suppression of the escape coefficient in the time range of @xmath273 , @xmath84 being the optical depth of the halo . when @xmath84 is large , the escape coefficient will be substantially suppressed for time range comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "this is equal to say that the escape coefficient is much less than one in all time .",
    "low escape coefficient is often explained by dust absorption .",
    "dust extinction is effective only when the medium is optically thick .",
    "therefore , once we use the model of dust absorption at high redshift , the time - dependent behavior must be considered .",
    "a weno time - dependent solution of the ly@xmath0 photon transfer in dusty medium will be reported soon .",
    "we did nt consider the ly@xmath0 photons from the recombination in the ionized halo around the center source",
    ". simply changing the luminosity of the central light source by adding the photons from stable recombination in the halo is a poor approximation , as the time scale of the recombination is not small",
