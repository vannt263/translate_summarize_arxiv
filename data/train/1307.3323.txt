    "the spiked harmonic oscillator ( sho ) defined by the hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are positive definite parameters signifying the strength of perturbation and type of singularity , has been of considerable interest for over three decades .",
    "this has a number of interesting physical as well as mathematical properties and found applications in chemical , nuclear and particle physics .",
    "for example , this represents a prototype of the so - called klauder phenomenon @xcite , i.e. , even after the perturbation is completely turned off ( @xmath6 ) , some interaction still remains .",
    "the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series diverges following the relation @xmath7 , with @xmath0 denoting the order of perturbation .",
    "another interesting feature is that in the region of @xmath8 , this gives rise to supersingularity , i.e. , the potential is so singular that any nontrivial correction to the energy ( matrix element ) diverges @xcite .",
    "a fascinating property from a purely mathematical point of view is that there is no dominance of either of the two terms @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the extreme values of @xmath4 . in other words",
    ", there is a tug - of - war between the two terms .",
    "typical shape of the potential for a few parameter sets are depicted in fig .",
    "1    like most of the practical physical systems , exact analytical solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation ( se ) for arbitrary parameters for a general state ( both ground and excited ) is yet to be known and consequently approximations such as variational or perturbation methods must be used .",
    "thus a large number of attempts have been made towards the exact and approximate calculation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions employing analytic , seminumerical or purely computational methods [ 3 - 18 ] . as the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series for the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath11 diverges @xcite , a modified perturbation theory to finite order",
    "was developed which gave good result for the ground - state eigenvalues of small @xmath4 . for large positive values of @xmath4",
    ", approximate estimates were made through the large coupling perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "a resummation technique for weak coupling of the nonsingular sho ( @xmath12 ) @xcite was developed .",
    "exact and approximate solutions are also given for the lowest states of a given angular momentum @xcite .",
    "a wkb treatment has been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently extensive studies have been made on the upper and lower bounds as well as the direct eigenvalues by means of the geometrical approximation and method of potential envelopes @xcite .",
    "the analytical pseudoperturbation shifted-@xmath1 expansion @xcite has also been suggested .",
    "reliable results were reported by using a richardson extrapolation of the finite - difference scheme @xcite , integrating the radial schrdinger equation by lanczos grid method @xcite , analytic continuation method @xcite , etc . recently a generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method was shown to produce very accurate results for the sho eigenvalues , eigenfunctions and other properties @xcite .",
    "arbitrary eigenstates corresponding to any given @xmath0 and @xmath1 values were treated for any general potential parameters within a simple and unified manner .",
    "in parallel to these above works , recently there has been significant interest [ 19 - 24 ] in studying a _ generalized spiked harmonic oscillator _ ( gsho ) as well , defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath13 both using variational and perturbation methods .",
    "here @xmath4 , @xmath5 are two real parameters and the sho is a special case of gsho with @xmath14 .",
    "the present study is motivated by these recent works of hall and coworkers [ 19 - 24 ] . in @xcite using a perturbation expansion up to 3rd order , they estimated the _ lower and upper bounds _ of the gsho ground states for _ small _ coupling parameter @xmath4 ( four values in the range of 0.0011 ) . however no _ direct _ results were given .",
    "other than this , we are not aware of any other works towards the calculation of these bound states or even the approximate bounds .",
    "hence it would be of some interest to investigate the spectra of this system in some detail .",
    "the objective of this work is thus to report the accurate eigenvalues , eigenfunctions , expectation values of some position operators of the gsho for the first time . as shown in later sections , both _",
    "lower _ and _ higher _ states can be tackled very efficiently for arbitrary parameters including both _",
    "weak _ and _ strong _ coupling in a simple manner .",
    "moreover , in order to understand the spectra , we make a detailed analysis on the effect of variation of the parameters on eigenvalues and radial densities .",
    "for this we employ the gps method , which has been very successful to produce accurate and reliable results in recent years for a variety of singular potentials relevant to quantum mechanics , static and dynamic properties of atom , molecules , as well as the spherically confined isotropic harmonic oscillator [ 18,25 - 28 ] . the article is organized as follows : section ii gives a brief outline of the gps method used here to solve the se for the gsho .",
    "a discussion of the results is made in section iii , while we make a few concluding remarks in section iv .    , for @xmath15 for several values of @xmath16 and @xmath4 . ]",
    "this section presents an overview of the gps formalism used for solving the radial se of a hamiltonian containing a gsho potential within the nonrelativistic framework .",
    "only essential steps are given as relevant details have been presented earlier [ 18,25 - 28 ] . unless otherwise mentioned , atomic units are employed throughout this letter .",
    "the radial se can be written in the following form , @xmath17 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r ) = e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is as given in eq .",
    "note that a 2 factor is introduced for the sake of consistency with the literature . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 signify the usual radial and angular momentum quantum numbers respectively .",
    "one of the distinctive features of gps method is that it allows one to work in a nonuniform and optimal spatial discretization ; a coarser mesh at larger @xmath20 and a denser mesh at smaller @xmath20 , while maintaining a similar accuracy at _ both _ the regions .",
    "thus it suffices to work with a significantly smaller number of radial points efficiently , which is in sharp contrast to some of the commonly used finite difference or finite element methods for the singular potentials , where one is almost forced to use considerably larger mesh , often presumably because of their uniform nature .",
    "this feature was realized and exploited during the recent accurate calculation of high - lying multiply excited _ rydberg _ series of li isoelectronic series @xcite using density functional theory .",
    "the key step is to approximate a function @xmath21 defined in the interval @xmath22 $ ] by the n - th order polynomial @xmath23 as follows through a cardinal function @xmath24 , @xmath25 which guarantees that the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 , requiring that the cardinal function satisfies @xmath28 . in the legendre pseudospectral method which we use here , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the @xmath31",
    "are obtained from the roots of the first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath32 with respect to @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath24 are given by , @xmath35 now one can map the semi - infinite domain @xmath36 $ ] onto the finite domain @xmath22 $ ] by the transformation @xmath37 . at this stage ,",
    "introduction of an algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath38 where l and @xmath39 are the mapping parameters , gives rise to the transformed differential equation as : @xmath40 .",
    "applying the legendre pseudospectral method now to this equation followed by a symmetrization procedure finally leads to a _ symmetric _",
    "eigenvalue problem , @xmath41 \\chi_j = \\epsilon_{nl } \\chi_i\\ ] ] which can be easily solved by standard available routines to yield highly accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . here",
    "@xmath42 with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 denoting the symmetrized second derivative of the cardinal function given as [ 18,25 - 28 ] .",
    "@xmath45 a large number of tests were carried out in order to make a detailed check on the accuracy and reliability of our calculation by varying the mapping parameters so as to produce `` stable '' results . in this way , a consistent set of parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 were chosen which seemed to be appropriate for all the calculations performed in this work .",
    "the results are reported only up to the precision that maintained stability .",
    "the energy values are _ truncated _ rather than _ rounded - off _ and thus may be considered as correct up to the place they are reported .",
    "first in table i we give a comparison of the gps eigenvalues of gsho with the available literature data as an illustration to assess the validity and usefulness of our present calculation .",
    "lowest two eigenvalues of @xmath48 are given at six values of @xmath4 in the range of 0.001100 covering both weaker and stronger interaction to demonstrate the generality of our results .",
    "the only result available in the literature corresponds to @xmath49 , @xmath15 and we stick to them , although we are confident that this will produce equally correct results for any other set of parameters or states . the lowest state corresponding to @xmath50 for @xmath51 and 1 have been studied through the upper and lower bounds @xcite , and those are presented in the footnote .",
    "note that those results are divided by 2 to get the entries in the table .",
    "they used a third - order perturbation expansion using the procedure suggested by burrows _ _",
    "e__t al @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , there are a number of variational methods available for the gsho hamiltonian , which can provide accurate _",
    "upper _ bounds in question , but they do not lead to _ direct _ evaluation of energies .",
    "furthermore , for _ smaller _ @xmath4 values , these methods are slow and in general , a large number of matrix elements are required to achieve a reasonable accuracy .",
    "as can be seen from the table , our results give estimates for all the four values of @xmath4 that perfectly lie in between those bounds .",
    "clearly as anticipated , for smaller @xmath4 values the bounds are narrow and hence very accurate methods such as the present ones would be needed to generate correct values .",
    "no results are available for any other parameter sets or states and our calculation could be helpful in future studies of these systems .",
    "we also did similar calculations for @xmath52 with @xmath49 leading to similar kind of results and conclusions and thus are omitted .",
    ".[tab : table1]comparison of the calculated gsho eigenvalues ( in a.u . ) for @xmath49 and @xmath15 .",
    "first two eigenvalues are given for each @xmath1 .",
    "literature results are appropriately converted to the current scale of units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above variation of energies with potential parameters are shown more clearly in fig .  2 .",
    "the top panel ( a)(c ) depicts the @xmath4 vs. @xmath53 plot for three @xmath16 values , _ viz . , _ 5 , 15 , 25 respectively . for each @xmath16 ,",
    "the first three states of @xmath50 are presented ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 from bottom to top ) and @xmath4 varied from 035 .",
    "these are studied for both @xmath15 and 6 as marked in the figure .",
    "note that the energy axes in ( a)(c ) and ( d)(f ) are kept fixed at 012 and 213 .",
    "the variation of energies with respect to @xmath4 are rather slow ( monotonically increases as @xmath4 increases ) for both @xmath15 and 6 , with smaller @xmath5 exerting relatively larger effect . at smaller @xmath4 ( in the vicinity of zero ) ,",
    "the @xmath15 and 6 energies are quite close to each other for all values of @xmath16 and with an increase in @xmath4 they show pronounced separation . as @xmath16 increases , the slope of @xmath4 vs. @xmath53 decreases , making the plot rather flat as in ( c ) , signifying even slower variation of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath4 . in the bottom , we show the @xmath16 vs. @xmath53 in the range of @xmath57 for three values of @xmath4 , namely 1 , 10 , 25 respectively in ( d)(f ) .",
    "once again we show the first three states of @xmath50 of both @xmath58 and 6 , which make three separate families . for a given @xmath4 , as @xmath16 increases , @xmath53 increases",
    "rather sharply compared to those in top panel , ( a)(c ) .",
    "interestingly however , for @xmath59 , the @xmath15 and 6 plots seem to be virtually identical for all the three states .",
    "as @xmath4 increases the separation gradually increases slowly as one passes from ( d)-(e)-(f ) .     with respect to @xmath4 ( top ) and @xmath16 ( bottom ) respectively for the first three states belonging to @xmath50 of a gsho having @xmath15 and 6 .",
