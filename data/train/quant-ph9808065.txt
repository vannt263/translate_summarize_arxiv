    "in quantum communication , qubits @xcite are sent across quantum channels that connect distant nodes of a quantum network . in general , these quantum channels are noisy and therefore limit the fidelity of the transmission .",
    "a bottleneck for quantum communication is the scaling of the probability of transmission errors with the length of the channels connecting the nodes .",
    "different from classical ( digital ) communication , the  signals \" in quantum communication consist of single qubits which may be entangled .",
    "owing to fundamental principles , these qubits can not be cloned @xcite nor amplified @xcite without destroying the essential quantum feature .",
    "this fact limits the maximum distance between the nodes to a few multiples of the absorption length ( or the coherence length ) of the channel , and poses a severe restriction on any practical application .",
    "for example , in recent experiments on quantum cryptography @xcite , single photons are sent through optical fibers with a given absorption and depolarization length .",
    "this has two effects : @xmath0 to transmit a photon without absorption , the number of trials scales exponentially with @xmath1 ; @xmath2 even when a photon arrives , the fidelity of the transmitted state decreases exponentially with @xmath1 . in the experiment ,",
    "the distance between the nodes is therefore presently limited by a few multiples of the absorption length of the fiber @xcite .    in the context of fault - tolerant quantum computing @xcite , knill and laflamme",
    "@xcite have discussed an important scheme that allows , in principle , to transmit a qubit over arbitrarily long distances with a polynomial overhead in the resources .",
    "their method requires to encode a single qubit into a concatenated quantum code ( i.e.  an entangled state of a large number of qubits ) and to operate on this code repeatedly while it is propagated through the channel .",
    "the tolerable error probabilities for transmission are less than @xmath3 , whereas for local operations they are less than @xmath4 .",
    "this seems to be outside the range of any practical implementation in the near future . a crucial figure for",
    "any experiment will be the number of particles that can be manipulated locally in a coherent fashion , together with the precision with which such local manipulations can be realized .",
    "for instance , even when the number of particles scales only polynomially with the length of the channel , a polynomially large number may still be far too large for any practical implementation .",
    "a central tool in the theory of quantum information , specifically for quantum communication is entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "it allows , in principle , to create maximally entangled states of particles at different locations even if the channel that connects those locations is noisy @xcite .",
    "these entangled particles can then be used for faithful teleportation @xcite or secure quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore natural to use this method as an ingredient for a quantum repeater .",
    "furthermore , it allows highly efficient two - way protocols which can not be realized with quantum error correction procedures .",
    "if a noisy quantum channel is much longer than its coherence length , one can not directly employ standard purification schemes .",
    "these schemes first create an ensemble of low fidelity epr pairs across the channel , and then purify / distill a few perfect epr pairs out of the ensemble .",
    "this , however , requires a minimum fidelity @xmath5 of the initial pairs to operate with , which can not be achieved as the length @xmath1 of the channel increases .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the problem of a quantum repeater based on the method of entanglement purification .",
    "the idea of such a repeater is to divide a long quantum channel into shorter segments , which are purified separately , before they are connected .",
    "connecting two segments of a channel means here to build up quantum correlations across the compound channel from correlations that exist across the individual segments .",
    "this can be done by entanglement swapping , or teleportation of entanglement .",
    "a quantum repeater must therefore combine the methods of entanglement purfication and teleportation .",
    "although the combination of these methods should , in principle , allow to create entanglement over arbitrary distances , it is another question how much this `` costs '' in terms of resources needed for purification .",
    "resources means here the number of low fidelity epr pairs that have to be provided for purification of each channel segment .",
    "this quantity is related to the number of particles that have to be manipulated locally ( at the connection points between the segments ) in a coherent fashion .",
    "if the resources grow too fast with the length of the channel , not much will be gained by the whole procedure .",
    "a further important quantity is the error tolerance for the local operations . in every real situation",
    ", the local operations applied to one or more particles , will bear some imperfections . since such operations are the building blocks for any entanglement purification protocol , their imperfections will limit the maximum attainable fidelity for an epr pair and the efficiency of the protocol . in the context of the quantum repeater",
    ", a maximum fidelity @xmath6 corresponds to a residual amount of noise for each segment .",
    "when the segments are connected , this noise accumulates .",
    "to give a realistic treatment of the quantum repeater , we will therefore first study the applicability and the efficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect local operations .",
    "the general conditions under which standard purification protocols can be used in the presence of errors have been studied by giedke _",
    "this includes , in particular , thresholds and lower bounds for the attainable fidelities . for a generic class of stochastic errors",
    ", one can give explicit representations of the imperfect operations in terms of completely positive maps and/or povms @xcite . in terms of these maps , we derive recursion formulas for the fidelities , which generalize the results given by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite and by deutsch _",
    "_ @xcite . from these results",
    ", we estimate that , for a generic class of errors , standard entanglement purifcation protocols work even for error probabilities of the order of a few per cent . in the context of long distance communication ,",
    "we develop a purification procedure that combines the standard protocols with quantum teleportation in a certain way to be specified .",
    "this purification procedure allows quantum communication via noisy channels of arbitrary length .",
    "since it explicitly exploits two - way classical communication @xcite , our procedure is much more efficient for quantum communication than protocols based on quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "specifically , this solution of the quantum repeater tolerates errors on the per - cent level ; it requires a polynomial overhead in time and an overhead in local resources that grows only logarithmically with the length of the channel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ error ] we introduce a generic error model to describe imperfect local operations such as noisy 1 bit and 2 bit operations and imperfect measurements . with the aid of these models",
    ", we revisit in sec .",
    "[ secelements ] the basic elements of quantum communication  purfication and teleportation .",
    "this discussion includes results for the maximum attainable fidelities and the working conditions of the standard protocols under the condition of noisy local operations .",
    "after this discussion , in sec .",
    "[ secqrep ] , we are ready to attack the quantum repeater problem itself .",
    "our solution combines the methods of entanglement purification and entanglement swapping into a single ( meta- ) protocol , which we call nested entanglement purification .",
    "this protocol allows to distribute entanglement with a given fidelity across arbitrary long distances , even when local operations are imperfect .",
    "it requires an overhead in local resources that grows polynomially with the length of the channel .",
    "a modification of this protocol works with resources that grow only logarithmically with the length of the channel ( while the build - up time grows polynomially ) .",
    "imperfections of local operations can have various origins .",
    "an example for an imperfect one - qubit operation is a unitary ` overrotation ' @xcite , as it would be realized by a laser pulse that effects a bloch rotation around an angle that slightly deviates from the ideal ( intended ) one .",
    "if the laser is well stabilized but the pulse area tuned incorrectly , say , the deviation of the real from the intended ( unitary ) rotation will be the same when we repeat the operation , representing an example of a systematic error .",
    "if , on the other hand , the angle of the rotations fluctuates randomly around a certain mean value , every pulse introduces a certain amount of noise into the system , and the resulting operation would be described by a non - unitary map . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on this latter situation , that is we assume only stochastic errors and neglect systematic errors .",
    "to give a precise description of a noisy 1-bit or 2-bit operation , one needs to know the exact form of the error mechanisms , which in turn depend on the specific physical implementation .",
    "in general , we have only limited knowledge of these details .",
    "a generic model for a noisy channel is the so - called ( symmetric ) depolarizing channel .",
    "it transforms a qubit with initial state @xmath7 in the way @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the identity operator and @xmath10 depends on the time for which the qubit is subjected to the channel .",
    "the action of the channel thus results in admixing a completely depolarized state @xmath11 to the initial density operator .",
    "the limit @xmath12 corresponds to a very noisy channel , while @xmath13 describes a channel with very little noise (  ideal storage \" ) .",
    "one can easily generalize ( [ depol ] ) to the case where the ideal operation is some arbitrary unitary ( 1-bit ) operation @xmath14 , @xmath15 in this situation , the ideal operation is accompanied by the action of the depolarizing channel .",
    "the whole map becomes non - unitary .",
    "it describes an imperfect 1-bit operation , which for @xmath13 becomes identical to the ideal unitary map .",
    "we call @xmath16 the _ reliability _ of the imperfect operation , which represents a lower bound to the probability that its result corresponds to the ideal one . for a parametrization",
    "@xmath17 an imperfect ( noisy ) rotation may explicitly be defined by the map @xmath18 where the noise function @xmath19 is normalized to unity and describes the fluctuations @xmath20 of the ( generalized ) bloch vector @xmath21 .",
    "one can easily show that for  isotropic noise , \" @xmath22 , the integral reduces to @xmath23 wherein @xmath24 describes the ideal rotation .",
    "motivated by these observations , we generalize this model to arbitrary one - qubit and two - qubit gates @xcite acting on an entangled state @xmath25 of several qubits .",
    "we thereby require that errors introduced by local operations may only affect the local qubits on which the ideal operation acts ( locality condition ) .",
    "let @xmath25 be a state of @xmath26 qubits , labeled by @xmath27 .",
    "an imperfect one - qubit operation acting on the first qubit , say , is then described by the map @xmath28 whereas an imperfect two - qubit operation acting on qubits 1 and 2 is described by @xmath29 in these expressions , @xmath30 is the ideal ( perfect ) operation and @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote unit operators on the subspace where the ideal operation acts , corresponding to totally depolarized one and two - qubit states .",
    "the state of the other particles are described by the partial traces @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , of the initial density operator over theses subspaces .",
    "the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 measure the _ reliability _ of the operations , where perfect operations correspond to @xmath37 . technically speaking , an imperfect operation is modeled by the corresponding ideal operation accompanied / followed by a depolarizing channel that acts ( only ) on the same subspace as the ideal operation",
    ".    note that the maps ( [ one_qubit_op ] ) and ( [ two_qubit_op ] ) are linear and trace conserving , albeit non - unitary . for any state @xmath7 which is diagonal in the bell basis defined by any two of the particles  all states we deal with in this paper are of this form  ,",
    "the model is self consistent in the sense that @xmath38 ( two single - qubit operations , each described by an error parameter @xmath35 ) can be written as a certain two - qubit operation @xmath39 described by an error parameter @xmath40 .",
    "generally , any sequence of local operations can be written as a single joint operation within this model .",
    "the resulting error parameter ( i.e.  reliability ) describing the joint operation is obtained by multiplying the error parameters of the single operations .",
    "we will use these maps to estimate the role of imperfect operations in standard protocols for entanglement purification and for teleportation .",
    "although the model is simple , it is generic at the same time .",
    "we just mention here that similar maps may be derived from a jaynes - type principle , insofar as their resulting states maximize the entropy of the resulting state with respect to variations that are trace conserving and keep the average fidelity of the operation constant .",
    "we finally describe an _ imperfect measurement _ on a single qubit ( in the computational basis ) by a povm @xcite corresponding to the ` imperfect projectors ' @xmath41 the parameter @xmath42 is a measure for the quality of the projection onto the basis states .",
    "assume the qubit to be measured is in the state @xmath43 and we are trying to measure its state with the aid of an measurement apparatus described by ( [ povm ] ) .",
    "the expectation values @xmath44 and @xmath45 simply mean that the apparatus will give us the wrong result ( `` 1 '' ) with probability @xmath46 .",
    "that is , the result is not completely reliable .",
    "an ideal measurement , in contrast , is described by @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that the effect of the measurement on the measured qubit is not fully specified by the povm ( [ povm ] ) . in the present context , however , this description is sufficient as all measured particles are removed from the system i.e.  we trace over their degrees of freedom after the measurement .",
    "the operations ( [ one_qubit_op ] ) and ( [ two_qubit_op ] ) together with single - qubit measurements ( [ povm ] ) are sufficient to describe all operations occurring in the context of teleportation and entanglement purification . for example , a bell measurement ( the measurement of a projector in the bell basis ) on two particles , say 1 and 2 , can be realized by a two - qubit operation @xmath48 ( controlled not ) followed by a hadamard rotation of particle 1 and two single - qubit measurements @xmath49 , @xmath50 on particles 1 and 2 @xcite . instead of performing the hadamard transformation one can also measure particle 1 in a rotated basis . in summary ,",
    "an imperfect bell measurement is described by an imperfect two - qubit operation followed by 2 imperfect single - qubit measurements , effecting e.g.  @xmath51 .",
    "in this section we reconsider the basic elements of quantum communication , which are teleportation and purification , in the presence of local errors .",
    "purification is the distillation of few perfect epr pairs out of many imperfect pairs . in the following ,",
    "we will generalize two different purification protocols that have been treated in the literature , by introducing imperfect gate and measurement operations . in subsection [ purificationc ] , we then discuss a modified version of these schemes which , generally speaking , has less favorable convergence properties but works with a smaller and constant number of _ physical resources_.      this purification scheme was introduced by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite . in short ,",
    "the scheme takes two pairs ( 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 ) as in fig .",
    "[ purify1 ] , both in a werner state = f|^+^+|+()(|^-^-|+|^+^+|+|^-^-| ) .",
    "[ werner ] with fidelity @xmath52 .",
    "then it performs local ( 1 @xmath53 2-bit ) operations on the particles at the same ends of the pairs . writing @xmath54 ,",
    "this essentially involves two cnot operations , cnot@xmath55 and cnot@xmath56 acting on the state @xmath57 , followed by a simple measurement @xmath58 , @xmath59 of the particles @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "if the particles are found in the same state ( 00 or 11 ) , the remaining pair , described by the state @xmath62 is kept , otherwise it is discarded . to obtain a recursive mapping between werner states , a non - unitary depolarization operation ( twirl )",
    "is applied to the resulting state before it is used for the next purification step .",
    "the original treatment of this protocol @xcite assumes that all operations and measurements of the protocol are perfect .    to estimate the effect of local errors , we evaluate the protocol with the aid of the imperfect operations ( [ one_qubit_op][povm ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the fidelity @xmath63 of the new pair @xmath62 is somewhat lengthy but straightforward , and the result can be given in analytic form .",

    "this defines a fraction of @xmath67 of the initial ensemble of pairs , where @xmath68 denotes the probability for finding the particles @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the state 00 or 11 , and is given by the denominator in ( [ modified_bennett ] ) .",

    "this feature , together with additional @xmath99 rotations that are applied to the qubits before the cnot operations , makes scheme b a much faster converging protocol .    in the following analysis ,",
    "we evaluate scheme b using the imperfect operations ( [ one_qubit_op])([povm ] ) instead of perfect ones . a @xmath99 rotation followed by a cnot operation",
    "is thereby treated as a joint 2-qubit operation with a single error parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting map between the diagonal elements @xmath98 is described in @xcite ; it completely characterizes the action of this purification protocol .",
    "successive purification steps are now described by iterated applications of this map . for each purification step ,",
    "two identical pairs ( which result from the previous step ) are used .",
    "the resources can be calculated in a similar way as for scheme a.    the fixpoints of this map are no longer described by a single parameter f but by a set of 4 numbers @xmath100 .",
    "the fidelity of such a diagonal bell state is given by @xmath101 , the @xmath102 component and , for simplicity , we shall continue to call this component  fixpoint `` of scheme b , although the fixpoint is not sufficiently described by this single parameter .",
    "for example , it may happen that a werner state with a certain fidelity @xmath103 can not be purified , while a binary state with the same fidelity @xmath103 that has only two nonzero components @xmath102 and @xmath104 , say , ( in short : ' ' binary state ( a , c ) \" ) can be purified .",
    "we have numerically compared schemes a and b , and found that scheme b converges much faster towards the upper fixpoint @xmath76 if @xmath105 as can be seen in fig.[benoxf1 ] .",
    "surprisingly , the upper fixpoint for scheme b is above the one for scheme a for given error parameters and does not depend on the  shape \" of the initial state .",
    "the lower fixpoint @xmath5 is smaller for scheme b and therefore the interval within which purification is possible is _ larger _ for scheme b , and so is the maximal reachable fidelity .",
    "the fixpoints as a function of the error parameters @xmath94 are plotted in fig.[benoxf3 ] .",
    "one can see that scheme b is significantly less sensitive to noisy local operations than scheme a.      both schemes ( a and b ) need many elementary pairs to start with , which have to be stored somewhere before the protocols are applied .",
    "the physical resources are thus quite large and grow with the number of necessary purification steps . in the following ,",
    "we modify scheme b in a certain way , and call this scheme c.    different from scheme b , we do not use two identical pairs at each purification step ( which are left over from previous purification steps ) but always purify one and the same pair with the help of an auxiliary pair @xmath106 with constant fidelity @xmath107 . apart from that",
    ", we employ the same protocol ( that is the sequence of local operations and measurements ) as in scheme b. the resulting map is thus the same , the only difference being that @xmath108 is a diagonal bell state which is constant throughout the whole purification procedure and is given by @xmath109 .",
    "this auxiliary pair is repeatedly created before each purification step between two of the four particles as visualized in fig.[ibkresfig ] .",
    "if a purification process is not successful , one has to start from the beginning ( when both pairs 12 and 34 are put in the state @xmath106 ) . using this procedure",
    ", the fidelity converges towards a given fixpoint @xmath110 which is _ not _ equal to one @xcite .",
    "the fixpoint highly depends on both the initial fidelity _ and _ the shape ( other diagonal elements in the bell basis ) of the state @xmath106 .",
    "the properties of the fixpoint will be discussed in more detail later on .    for ideal operations ,",
    "this method is generally less favorable as far as its convergence properties are concerned .",
    "however , for imperfect operations , the situation changes and the drawback that the reachable fixpoint @xmath111 is smaller than unity becomes less important . as we shall see later , for imperfect local operations",
    "the fixpoint of scheme c may lie even _ above _ the fixpoints of schemes a and b ( see fig .  [ ibkoxf1 ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this scheme is , however , that the _ physical resources _ , that is the number of particles needed at a or b to store the pairs , are _ constant _ ( namely 2 ) and independent of the number of necessary purification steps .",
    "this fact makes scheme c particulary interesting for the repeater problem , where the accumulation of local particles at the connection points of a compound long channel plays an important role .",
    "the _ purification resources _",
    ", on the other hand , that is the ( average ) number of how often an auxiliary pair has to be created in order to perform @xmath70 purification steps , have now to be calculated in a different way .",
    "let @xmath112 be the probability to succeed at the @xmath113 purification step .",
    "the total resources can be calculated using the iteration formula m_k+1=(m_k+1 ) . to close this formula , note that @xmath114=1 .",
    "this can be understood as follows : starting at the elementary level , one needs two pairs for purification and has to repeat the procedure on average @xmath115 times .",
    "thus @xmath116 . for the next purification step",
    ", one needs one additional elementary pair to perform the next purification step .",
    "this step has to be performed on average @xmath117 times . the resources to perform the second purification step are thus given by @xmath118 and so on .",
    "to perform @xmath70 purification steps , one needs to create on average m_k_max=_i=1^k_max(_k = i^k_max ( ) ) [ iteration ] times an auxiliary pair .",
    "a related quantity is the average number of purification steps ( including also those which fail ) .",
    "this is given by the iteration formula s_k+1=(s_k+1 ) where @xmath119 and k denotes the number of _ successful _ purification steps .",
    "if no purification is performed , the number of steps @xmath119 .",
    "this is the only difference to the iteration formula ( [ iteration ] ) for the resources , since every time an elementary pair is created , one performs a purification step .",
    "thus the average total number of purification steps performed ( assuming that @xmath70 steps were successful ) is given by s_k_max=_i=1^k_max(_k = i^k_max ( ) ) .[iteration1 ]    the fixpoint discussion for this purification protocol is more involved due to the many parameters , namely the fidelity @xmath107 and the shape ( other diagonal elements @xmath120 ) of the elementary pair , and the error parameters @xmath36 and @xmath75 describing the noisy local operations . for this protocol , purification is possible if the reachable fidelity ( fixpoint ) for a certain auxiliary pair lies above its initial fidelity . to illustrate first the shape dependence of the fixpoint , we introduce the following parameterization of diagonal bell states with constant fidelity @xmath103 . in the notation of ( [ bell_diag ] )",
    "we write a&=&f_0 + b = c&=&(1-f_0)(1-)/2 + d&=&(1-f_0 ) where @xmath121 .",
    "a werner state thereby described by @xmath122 and a binary state ( a , d ) is obtained for @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ ibk1 ] shows the dependence of the fixpoint as a function of @xmath124 for different error parameters .",
    "for the manifold of states covered by this parametrization one sees that the optimum shape of the elementary pair is a binary state ( a , d ) , meaning that the reachable fixpoint for a given initial fidelity is the largest for this shape .",
    "figure [ ibkoxf1 ] demonstrates two different things .",
    "first , it shows that the fixpoint ( maximally reachable fidelity ) depends on the initial fidelity of the elementary pair even if the other components are kept constant .",
    "second , it demonstrates that the reachable fidelity using this purification scheme may lie above the reachable fidelity using schemes a or b. ( the upper fixpoint for scheme a is not plotted here , but as we already know ( see fig.[benoxf3 ] ) it always lies below the fixpoint for scheme b ) .",
    "one should however mention that this is only the case if the shape of the elementary pair is close to the optimal configuration ( a , d ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows : scheme b always picks 2 pairs that result from a previous purification step and the shape of such a pair converges towards a  working state \" which no longer depends on the initial shape but only on the error parameters .",
    "scheme c , on the other hand , always uses the same auxiliary pair for each purification step which has _ not _ been influenced by noisy local operations in previous steps .",
    "as we have pointed out earlier , in general one can only increase the fidelity by a certain amount .      in the context of the quantum repeater",

    "the result of this sequence of operations , followed by a subsequent depolarization , is a werner state between particle 1 and 4 with a smaller fidelity @xmath126 , which is independent of the outcome of the measurement .",

    "each step in the ` staircase ' of fig.[figpuriloop ] corresponds to a successful purification step , and with help of the total number of necessary steps @xmath70 needed to recover one can calculate the needed resources m as described in section [ purification ] .",
    "once the initial value @xmath66 of the fidelity is reobtained , we have @xmath182 pairs and we can start with the next level k+1 . in summary , each level in the protocol corresponds to one cycle in fig .",
    "[ figpuriloop ] .",

    "( [ simple_fixpoints ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath189 , the purification interval in fig .",

    "c , the situation is similar , _ as long as _",
    "we do not use depolarization after each purification step ( i.e. keep all involved pairs during the purification process in the werner form ) .",
    "if we do use depolarization , thus realizing a modified version of protocol a , the loop can not be closed .",
    "differently speaking , for werner states , the fidelity that is lost by the connection process can never be regained by purification with this scheme . for this to be true",
    ", the repurification condition @xmath193 must be fulfilled , where the upper fixpoint @xmath76 is a function of the fidelity of the auxiliary @xmath158-pair .",
    "it can be shown analytically that this is not possible for scheme c with werner states .",
    "this underlines the fact that the purification scheme c is not a trivial variant of either of the schemes a and b.    note that both connection and purification are not smooth processes .",
    "this means that one can only perform whole steps and not parts of a step .",
    "due to this fact , one will not get an exactly closed purification loop , in general , but the final fidelity after the purification ( this is the value at which the ladder in fig .  [ figpuriloop ] ends ) may be slightly larger than the initial fidelity ; secondly , the final fidelity may be different at each nesting level , but it is always larger or equal to the fidelity of the elementary pairs .",
    "the length of a segment is limited by the transmission errors , and the number of segments @xmath127 one splits up the total channel should be varied in order to find out the optimal configuration .",
    "the quantum repeater can be characterized by two quantities , which depend on the used connection and purification protocol    * the total _ physical resources per segment _ needed to build up the epr pair - this gives the number of necessary parallel channels between two checkpoints . * the _ total time _ which is needed to build up the epr pair .",

    "( vertical axis in fig.[fignesting ] ) is completely determined by the resources m needed for each purification loop and is given by @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the number of nesting levels .",

    "@xmath69 is plotted against a working fidelity , which is the fidelity one starts with before connection and one ends up after re - purification .",
    "although the difference between schemes a and b does not look very dramatic , note that @xmath69 has to be taken to the @xmath199 power to calculate the resources per segment , where for long range communication @xmath200 ( see sec .",
    "[ compare ] ) .",
    "one can see that there exists an optimal working region , which can be understood as follows : for small working fidelities f , two things happen : firstly due to the polynomial law for the connection , the fidelity decreases strongly .",
    "secondly , purification becomes less effective near the lower fixpoint @xmath5 ( the gain per purification step gets smaller ) . for both reasons , many purification steps are needed to recover and thus the needed resources are large . for working fidelities",
    "f close to the maximal reachable fidelity ( upper fixpoint @xmath76 ) , one does not loose much due to the connection , but purification is less effective - the gain per purification step is smaller",
    ". therefore the the number of necessary steps is again quite large and so are the needed resources . in between there exists a region which is optimal in the sense that the needed resources are minimized . here",
    "a working fidelity @xmath201 turns out to be optimal for the chosen error parameters .",
    "the error dependence of the resources is shown in fig.[figoxford ] . for smaller error probabilities ( larger error parameters )",
    ", two things happen : the optimal working fidelity gets larger and the needed resources @xmath69 decrease . for imperfect local operations ,",
    "the needed resources increase to infinity if one really wants to reach the maximal achievable fidelity @xmath76 , only for perfect operations and @xmath186 , this is not true because one starts with perfect pairs and does not loose due to connection .",
    "therefore no purification is necessary and @xmath202 .",
    "using scheme c for purification , the situation is different .",
    "the vertical axis of fig.[fignesting ] ( which corresponds to the resources ) is translated into a `` temporal axis '' . instead of creating all needed pairs at the beginning and operating parallelly on ensembles of pairs at each checkpoint ( as in scheme a and b )",
    ", one creates the pairs needed for purification every time one needs one and operates sequentially on the pairs . to perform the purification process , every time only two pairs are involved .",
    "one is needed to store the purified state and the other one is repeatedly created to purify the first pair as visualized in fig.[ibkresfig ] .",
    "the number of _ physical resources _ required for purification is thus only 2 , but every time the purification was not successful one has to start from the very beginning .",
    "using scheme a or b one obtains a purified pair after @xmath70 successful purification steps , which is in this case also the number of really performed purification steps . looking at fig.[tree ]",
    ", one sees that a purification step which was not successful eliminates one branch of the tree , but after 4 steps ( in this example ) one ends up with a purified pair . in scheme c ,",
    "on the other hand , one does not follow all branches parallel but follows the branches sequentially ( and using always the same elementary pair for each purification step ) .",
    "this limits the number of involved particles , but increases the required time .",
    "looking now at the nested algorithm , it turns out that the required number of physical resources for scheme c grows linearly with the number of nesting levels and thus logarithmically with the number of segments ( and the distance ) .",
    "this is because one additional pair is needed for storage purposes at each nesting level .",
    "one can understand this by inspecting fig.[ibkrep ] .",
    "first , three elementary pairs are connected ( line 4 ) and used to purify the pair at line 3 , which now is the elementary pair for the next nesting level .",
    "second , three of these re - purified pairs ( line 3 ) are connected and used to purify the pair at line 2 . since one has to create such a pair repeatedly and all particles at lines 3 and 4 are involved , it is necessary to store the pair to be purified ( here in line 2 ) .",
    "therefore one needs one additional particle to store the pair at each new nesting level .",
    "this particle is not needed in all checkpoints , but only in those which lie on the _ borders _ of the corresponding nesting levels .",

    ". a similar form as in ( [ result_bloch_av ] ) may be obtained for two - bit rotations with a corresponding isotropic noise function , although the calculation is more complicated . in particular , we have not yet been successful in giving a proof in terms of a manifest _ parametrization - independent average _ over the invariant group manifold of su(4 ) .",
    "isotropic noise in this case means that the depolarizing channel does not distinguish between the two qubits and acts on them in a symmetric way .",

    "if the reliability @xmath35 is the same for all one - bit operations involved in the realization of the twirl , an _ imperfect depolarization _ can effectively be described by @xmath230 where @xmath231 summarizes reliability of the total twirl operation @xmath232 and @xmath62 is the bilocal state before the twirl is applied .",

    "<S> we study the use of entanglement purification for quantum communication over long distances . for distances much longer than the coherence length of a corresponding noisy quantum channel , the fidelity of transmission is usually so low that standard purification methods are not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> it is however possible to divide the channel into shorter segments that are purified separately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error correction , as it makes explicit use of two - way classical communication . </S>",
    "<S> an important question is how the noise , introduced by imperfect local operations ( that constitute the protocols of purification and the entanglement swapping ) , accumulates in such a compound channel , and how it can be kept below a certain noise level . to treat this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we first study the applicability and the efficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect local operations . we then present a scheme that allows entanglement purification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the per - cent level . </S>",
