    "the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes occupy a privileged role among the asymptotically flat solutions to the einstein field equations .",
    "although they are respectively , static and stationary , they are models for dynamical black hole spacetimes .",
    "moreover , they are believed to describe , in a certain sense , the asymptotic state of the dynamical black hole spacetimes .",
    "it is generally agreed that in the next years , the main source of understanding of dynamical black hole spacetimes will come from numerical simulations of these solutions to the einstein field equations . normally , these numerical simulations make use of a 3 + 1 splitting of the spacetime .",
    "thus , it becomes of relevance acquiring an understanding of the 3 + 1 features of the schwarzschild and eventually the kerr solutions .",
    "some relevant research in this direction has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "when performing a 3 + 1 decomposition of the schwarzschild spacetime or essentially any other exact solution to the einstein equations the relative simplicity of the solution gets blurred by the choice of gauges which do not reflect the symmetries of the spacetime or its algebraic structure as in the case of the petrov type . in this context ,",
    "invariant characterisations of the spacetime become very useful in particular those involving scalars .    precisely in this set of mind , in reference @xcite , the following question was raised : when an initial data set for the einstein vacuum field equations corresponds to a slice in the schwarzschild spacetime ? by _ the schwarzschild spacetime _ it will be understood the schwarzschild - kruskal maximal extension , @xmath0 , of the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "an initial data set for the einstein vacuum field equations is a triplet @xmath1 consisting of a riemannian manifold @xmath2 and a symmetric tensor field @xmath3 in @xmath4 the first and second fundamental form , or alternatively , the initial 3-metric and extrinsic curvature satisfying the einstein vacuum constraint equations . under these circumstances",
    "the manifold @xmath4 can be isometrically embedded in a four dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath0",
    "a spacetime which is a solution of einstein vacuum field equations .",
    "such spacetime is called the _ development _ of the initial data set .",
    "it is well - known that a _ maximal development _ of an initial data set exists and is unique up to isometry @xcite . in this paper",
    "we establish conditions under which the development of an initial data set is a subset of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "data sets satisfying this property are called schwarzschild initial data .",
    "we shall assume @xmath4 to be either a cauchy hypersurface or an hyperboloid that is , a spacelike hypersurface which is asymptotically null .",
    "it is noted that in reference @xcite , a similar question , restricted to the case of spherically symmetric 3-geometries was raised .",
    "a partial answer to the question of the characterisation of schwarzschild initial data sets was provided in @xcite .",
    "it made use of the fact that for a vacuum spacetime , @xmath0 , the relation @xmath5 which in the sequel we will call the _ zakharov property _ , where @xmath6 denotes the weyl tensor of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a function , implies that the spacetime is of petrov type d @xcite .",
    "all the vacuum type d spacetimes are known , so a direct calculation reveals that the only petrov type d spacetimes satisfying the zakharov property are those which have an hypersurface orthogonal timelike killing vector thus , for example the kerr solution does not satisfy the zakharov property , but the schwarzschild spacetime does .",
    "the zakharov property projects nicely under a 3 + 1 decomposition , making it amenable for a characterisation of schwarzschild initial data .",
    "the characterisation given in @xcite was completed by the addition of two extra ingredients : the asymptotic flatness asymptotic euclideanity of the initial data and the non - vanishing of the adm mass .",
    "an important point which was left open was the question of the propagation of the zakharov condition : does the development of an initial data satisfying the zakharov property satisfy the property at latter times ?",
    "in the present article we pursue an alternative characterisation of schwarzschild data .",
    "in particular , we want to avoid the use of the two global ingredients used in @xcite : the asymptotic flatness and the non - vanishing of the adm mass .",
    "our starting point is a certain invariant characterisation of the schwarzschild spacetime in terms of concomitants of the weyl tensor which was given in @xcite .",
    "necessary conditions for a pair @xmath9 satisfying the vacuum constraint equations to be schwarzschild data are obtained by making a 3 + 1 splitting of the characterisation of reference @xcite .",
    "now , in order to answer the more subtle question whether the necessary conditions are also sufficient ones , one has to confront in one way or the other the issue of their _ propagation_. in our context the propagation of the conditions resulting from the 3 + 1 splitting of the characterisation of @xcite would imply that the initial data under question are indeed schwarzschildean .",
    "if the conditions do not propagate , then we may need to add extra conditions in order to construct schwarzschild initial data .",
    "this issue is dealt with by observing that the invariant characterisation of @xcite also yields a formula for the static killing vector of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this formula is again given in terms of concomitants of the weyl tensor , and can be split in _ lapse _ and _ shift _ terms .",
    "these shift and lapse can be pull - backed to the manifold @xmath4 and if they satisfy certain conditions which we shall call _ the killing initial data conditions _ the kid conditions then the development of the initial data possesses a killing vector .",
    "now , if the restriction of the resulting killing vector to the initial hypersurface @xmath4 is timelike for an open subset @xmath10 , then by continuity , there will be a timelike killing vector in , at least , a small portion of the domain of dependence of @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we can take advantage of the existence of a static timelike killing vector in @xmath12 to show that the conditions obtained from the 3 + 1 splitting of the invariant characterisation mentioned above can be propagated , at least in the small portion of @xmath12 , where the killing vector is stationary , thereby obtaining a full set of conditions ensuring that this part of @xmath12 is a subset of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this full set of conditions consists of the 3 + 1 splitting of the schwarzschild invariant characterisation and the kid conditions .",
    "a novelty in our approach lies in providing an explicit ansatz _a killing candidate_ for the the solution of these kid conditions , thus yielding an algorithmic procedure to verify the existence of a timelike vector in the development of the initial data .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section [ local - char ] we detail the local invariant characterisation of the schwarzschild spacetime presented in @xcite .",
    "this will be our starting point .",
    "section [ 1 + 3 ] deals with essential concepts used in the formulation of the initial value problem in general relativity and the 3 + 1 splitting of geometric quantities . using these tools",
    "we explain in section [ decompositions ] how to decompose the characterisation of ferrando and sez which leads us to a set of necessary conditions for initial data to be a schwarzschild initial data set see theorem [ first_necessary ]",
    ". a further analysis of these conditions is performed in section [ analysis ] where an algebraic classification of the electric and the magnetic parts of weyl tensor is performed providing canonical forms for them in each type of schwarzschild initial data set . in section",
    "[ sufficient ] we investigate how to enlarge the set of necessary conditions in order to obtain a set of geometric conditions guaranteeing that the initial data are indeed schwarzschild initial data .",
    "these extra conditions are given by the kid equations .",
    "the full set of conditions are put together in theorem [ main_result ] which is the most important result of this paper . a practical application of theorem [ main_result ]",
    "is presented in appendix [ kid_ts ] .",
    "a great deal of the algebraic calculations of this paper were undertaken with the mathematica package _ xtensor _ @xcite .",
    "this package is specially adapted to calculations involving abstract indexes and among its many features it includes algorithms to handle efficiently the 3 + 1 decomposition .",

    "boldface latin indices @xmath16 will be reserved to denote components with respect to a frame and they will range @xmath17 in a spacetime frame and @xmath18 in a spatial frame .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be two rank 4 tensors antisymmetric in the first and second pair of indices and symmetric under the interchange of these pair of indices .",

    "we shall use theorem [ thm_fersae ] with condition ( [ type_dd] ) instead of condition ( [ type_dd ] ) because the former is better suited for our calculations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the first part of our analysis will be concentrated with obtaining a 3 + 1 splitting of the conditions given in theorem [ thm_fersae ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be a 3-dimensional connected riemannian manifold .",

    ". therefore the data ( [ spheric - h ] ) , ( [ spheric - k ] ) are automatically schwarzschild initial data if the vacuum constraints hold .",

    "the elements of the orthonormal frame are defined by @xmath277 note that , since the vector fields @xmath172 and @xmath173 are orthogonal to the integrable 1-form @xmath278 , they give rise to an integrable 2-dimensional distribution .",
    "the coordinates @xmath279 parametrise the integral submanifolds of the distribution spanned by @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "also , according to ( [ a - eform ] ) any tangent vector to any of these submanifolds is an eigenvector of @xmath280 with eigenvalue @xmath104 which means that the basis vectors @xmath172 and @xmath173 span the eigenspace associated to the repeated eigenvalue @xmath104 .",

    "our strategy will be to find relations for @xmath208 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 and then plug these relations into ( [ kid2-expanded ] ) .",

    "therefore , in order to keep our expressions for @xmath300 and @xmath301 with partial derivatives of @xmath275 of at most degree 1 , we use in each step of the differentiation the first equation of ( [ riemann-1 ] ) to replace @xmath306 .",
