    "the t - j model constitutes together with the hubbard model a paradigm for the theoretical description of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) since its derivation by zhang and rice @xcite from a three - band hubbard ( spin - fermion ) model describing the copper - oxide planes present in hts .",
    "it can also be derived in second order perturbation theory around @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the strength of the interaction in the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath5 where the operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion with spin @xmath8 on the site @xmath9 .",
    "they are not canonical fermionic operators since they act on a restricted hilbert space without double occupancy .",
    "@xmath10 is the spin operator and @xmath11 is the density operator . in all expressions a summation over repeated indices",
    "is understood .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 denotes nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "while the main interest on this model resides on its two - dimensional ( 2d ) realization , it presents already in one dimension ( 1d ) a number of very interesting features .",
    "in contrast to the 1d repulsive hubbard model , where only a luttinger liquid ( ll ) phase for density @xmath13 and an insulating phase for @xmath14 are present , the t - j model possesses a rich phase diagram , as shown first by m.  ogata _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the phases display a correspondence to the ones present in hts , like superconductivity , spin gap and phase separation , albeit for values of @xmath15 outside the range pertaining to hts .",
    "however , since unbiased results for the 2d model , that up to now could only be obtained by exact diagonalization @xcite or by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , did not yet conclusively shed light on the different phases in the thermodynamic limit , the 1d version presents a possibility of gaining insight into exotic phases like the spin - gap region .",
    "a further motivation for achieving an accurate determination of the phase diagram of this model is the possibility of realizing it with ultra - cold fermionic quantum gases@xcite . for parameters aiming at an emulation of hts , still cooling techniques have to be implemented to reach the relevant energy scales ( @xmath16 , with @xmath17 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in the following , the spin - gap phase appears here at much larger values of @xmath0 ( @xmath18 ) , and hence this non - trivial phase is certainly much more accessible for experiments with degenerate quantum gases .    the 1d t - j model has been solved exactly only for @xmath19 , where it is equivalent to the @xmath20 hubbard model @xcite , and at the supersymmetric point @xmath21 @xcite . in both cases",
    "the model behaves as a ll @xcite .",
    "for very large @xmath15 the attractive interaction dominates against the kinetic energy and the system phase separates into hole rich regions and antiferromagnetic islands .",
    "although the first phase diagram appeared almost twenty years ago , there are still issues to be clarified like the boundaries of the spin - gap phase . in previous studies",
    "the existence of a spin gap has been deduced from exact diagonalization ( ed ) of small systems @xcite , variational @xcite , or projection @xcite methods , transfer - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg),@xcite and by a combination of renormalization group ( rg ) arguments with ed @xcite .",
    "in particular the last study found a much larger region in density for the spin - gap phase .",
    "a main goal of the present work is to achieve a precise determination of the phase diagram , by performing finite - size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit for the correlation functions and energy differences relevant for the different phases .",
    "the results are obtained using the dmrg method @xcite , on lattices with up to @xmath22 sites .",
    "we have to choose values of @xmath1 and @xmath23 such that the total particle number @xmath24 is an integer number . in most of the results we extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit using system sizes @xmath25 , 80 , 120 , 160 , and 200 .",
    "these values of @xmath23 allow us a discretization in density of @xmath26 which is consistent with @xmath27 being an even integer , and hence , the ground - state corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "all the results were obtained using at least @xmath29 dmrg vectors , 4 sweeps , and a discarded weight of @xmath30 .",
    "this translates into errors in energy of the order of 10@xmath31 and in correlation functions of the order of 10@xmath32 at the largest distances .",

    "they found three phases : repulsive ll phase ( metal ) , attractive ll phase ( superconductor ) and phase - separation . at that time they suspected the existence of a spin gap at low density but they could not prove its existence due to the limitation to small system sizes .",

    "the largest deviations appear as the onset line approaches the phase - separation line .",
    "this can be possibly due to the fact that the rg analysis did not take explicitly into account the appearance of phase - separation , that in general leads to a strong finite size dependence .",
    "on the other hand , a precise determination with dmrg becomes extremely demanding at low densities ( @xmath169 ) , due to the need of very large systems in order to have a large enough number of particles to faithfully represent a phase .",
