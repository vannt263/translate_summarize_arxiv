    "in recent years , a large number of theoretical calculations , numerical simulations and experiments has been carried out on systems of coupled anharmonic oscillators which provide fundamental models of the dynamical problems in several disciplines .",
    "such models describe a wide range of processes , helping in general to understand the routes to chaos that take place in biological , chemical , physical , electromechanical and electronical systems . here",
    "we refer only to recent papers close to the subject of our own[1 - 18 ] .",
    "coupling may arise between oscillators of the same types or oscillators of different types . amongst these systems , the most intensively investigated examples are the duffing oscillators[1 - 8 ] ( strictly dissipative systems which converge to quiescence when not driven ) , the van der pol oscillators[9 - 11 ] ( self - excited systems which final behavior when not driven is a limit cycle ) and the coupled van der pol - duffing oscillators [ 12 - 13 ] .",
    "+ in this paper we present the results of an investigation of two identical coupled double - well duffing oscillators subjected to a periodically driven force .",
    "our study was stimulated by the earlier work of kozlowski et al .",
    "@xcite who have studied the model of the same type , but considered only single - well potentials . using bifurcation diagrams and phase diagrams",
    "these authors have demonstrated that the global pattern of bifurcation curves in parameter space consists of repeated subpatterns similar to the superstructure found in a one - dimensional driven duffing oscillator .",
    "they have also proven the existence of a hopf bifurcation which does not appear in a model of one - dimensional duffing oscillator .",
    "other interesting results have been reported in the context of coupled duffing oscillators . in ref .",
    "@xcite kunick et al showed that two coupled oscillators can behave regularly with nonzero coupling and chaotically with zero coupling . in a model of two coupled duffing oscillators driven with incommensurate frequencies and coupled additively , stagliano et al  @xcite observed the period - doubling of an attracting @xmath2 torus and its destruction in parameter space .",
    "migration control in two duffing oscillators by open - plus - closed - loop control method and adaptive control algorithm were studied by paul et al  @xcite .",
    "these authors , in another system of two coupled duffing oscillators , have also investigated a basin of attraction with several coexisting chaotic attractors and synchronization of chaos  @xcite .",
    "yagasaki  @xcite , after having described an auto driver hommap for numerical analysis of homoclinic in maps of periodically forced duffing systems , modified a version of the homoclinic melnikov method for orbits homoclinic to two types of periodic orbits .",
    "these theories have been successfully applied to a weakly coupled duffing oscillators .",
    "moreover yin et al  @xcite investigated the effect of phase difference in the driving forces of two coupled identical duffing oscillators .",
    "they observed desynchronization and lag synchronization of chaotic attractors .",

    "+ the equations of motion for the two identical coupled double - well duffing oscillators that we are interested in are the following : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the damping parameter , @xmath5 the coupling parameter , @xmath0 and @xmath6 the amplitude and the frequency of the driving force , respectively . in system ( [ e1 ] ) , we represent the oscillators by the state variables @xmath7 as oscillator @xmath8 or subsystem @xmath8 subjected to the periodic force @xmath9 , which is coupled to the other one with the state variables @xmath10 as oscillator @xmath11 or subsystem @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are the control parameters of our system . as evident , for @xmath12 , equation ( 1 )",
    "describes two uncoupled duffing oscillators with their motion governed by @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the coupling considered can be interpreted as a perturbation of each oscillator through a signal proportional to the difference of their amplitudes . a natural question to ask",
    "is how chaotic attractors arise as these parameters are varied . in the case of one dimensional double - well duffing oscillator , quasiperiodic and period - doubling routes to chaos",
    "have been found  [ 19 - 27 ] .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section ii , we establish a linear stability analysis of the system projected on the poincar map .",
    "section iii is devoted to the survey of bifurcation diagrams and the chaotic behavior is characterized in section iv .",
    "we end with the conclusions of the work in section v.",
    "for stability analysis and even for purposes of numerical simulations , it is convenient to transform the second order differential equation ( 1 ) into an autonomous system of first order differential equations of the following form : @xmath13 or equivalently @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the period of the driving force , @xmath16 the cyclic variable , @xmath17 an autonomous vector field and @xmath18 an element of the parameter space .",
    "this system generates a flow @xmath19 on the phase space @xmath20and there exists a global map : @xmath21 with @xmath22 being a constant determining the location of the poincar cross - section and @xmath23 the coordinates of the attractors in the poincar cross - section @xmath24 defined by : @xmath25 . system ( [ e2 ] ) is symmetric since the transformation @xmath26 leaves ( [ e2 ] ) invariant .",
    "this system can support symmetric orbits and also asymmetric ones which are not invariant with the transformation s. we use a perturbation analysis to proceed analysis of solution stability in the poincar map @xmath27 .",
    "this method consists of differentiation and translation .",
    "thus if we add a small perturbation @xmath28(@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) to the steady state @xmath33(@xmath34 ) we obtain equations for perturbed motion @xmath35 substituting equations ( [ e3 ] ) into equations ( [ e2 ] ) and developing into powers of the above small perturbations yields the following variational differential equation : @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the jacobian @xmath39 matrix describing the vector field along the solution @xmath40 and @xmath33 being an equilibrium point or the steady state .",
    "next for the very small amplitudes , we neglect in the matrix @xmath38 the powers higher than one , that is , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the solution after one period @xmath43 of the oscillations in the linearised poincar map",
    "is simply expressed as : @xmath44 where @xmath38 is the monodromy matrix of a periodic orbit connecting arbitrary infinitesimal variations in the initial conditions @xmath45 with corresponding changes @xmath46 , after one period t. the stability of the periodic motion is therefore determined according to the real parts of the roots of the characteristic equation @xmath47 written in the following form : @xmath48 where @xmath49,@xmath50 are the coefficients depending on the two parameters @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath51 = @xmath52 the eigenvalues of @xmath38 . the roots of equation ( [ e6 ] )",
    "are obtained using the bairstow - newton - raphson algorithm  @xcite and for different values of @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the results as the spectrum of the eigenvalues are depicted in a complex plane @xmath55 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this figure enables us to get an idea of different types of bifurcation likely to appear in the system .",
    "since @xmath38 is a real matrix , complex eigenvalues occur in a complex conjugate pairs responsible of the symmetry observed along the real axis .",
    "thus if @xmath56 is real , it is clear from equation ( [ e5 ] ) that the eigenvalues is the rate of contraction ( @xmath57 ) or expansion ( @xmath58 ) near the steady state .",
    "next if @xmath56 is complex , the real part of @xmath56 gives the rate of contraction @xmath59 or expansion @xmath60 of the spiral while the imaginary part @xmath61 is of the frequency rotation .",
    "this can be well understood with the following expression of the eigenvalues of the linearized poincar map : @xmath62\\ ] ] globally , if @xmath63 for all @xmath56 , then all sufficiently small perturbations tend toward zero as t goes to infinity and the steady state ( nodes ( n ) , saddle nodes ( sn ) , spiral ( sp ) ) is stable .",
    "if @xmath64 for all @xmath56 , then any small perturbation grows with the time and the steady state @xmath65 is unstable ( a stable or unstable equilibrium state with no complex eigenvalues is often called node ) . on the other hand if there exists @xmath66 and @xmath67 such that @xmath63 and @xmath68 , therefore the equilibrium state is non - stable ( a non - stable equilibrium state is often called saddle ; an equilibrium point whose eigenvalues all have a non zero real part are called hyperbolic  @xcite ) .",
    "having regards to the precedent with again a look on the spectrum of fig.1 , it follows that our system of the given parameter k and @xmath4 can undergo many types of bifurcations namely : saddle - node @xmath69 , period - doubling @xmath70 , hopf bifurcations ( @xmath71 ) with @xmath72 and the motion has the form of exponential increasing beats with period @xmath73  @xcite ) and of course symmetry - breaking bifurcation which is often a prerequisite for the first period - doubling bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "except hopf bifurcation , such bifurcations have been successfully found in one - dimensional double - well duffing oscillators subjected to a periodically driven force  [ 19,21,26 ] using the eigenvalues called floquet multipliers of the linearized poincar map . in",
    "a coupled identical single - well duffing oscillators , kozlowski et al  @xcite showed by linear analysis a similar eigenvalues scenario and they conjectured that the resulting alternating bifurcation sequences have to be expected for all systems of coupled strictly dissipative oscillators that are driven periodically .",
    "the above analysis allows us to know how the steady state becomes locally unstable and to be aware of the type of bifurcation expected in the system . here",
    ", no exploding amplitude is possible since the shape of the potential offers globally bounded solutions @xmath74 .",
    "the aim of this section is to seek numerically the routes which lead to chaotic solutions of the system when the control parameter @xmath1 evolves , for different values of the driving force @xmath0 .",
    "bifurcation diagrams are very good for numerical as well as for experimental studies when there is a tunable parameter . when a control parameter is varied and bifurcation takes place a qualitative change of the system happens . for the numerical computations of these diagrams the control parameter @xmath1",
    "is increased from an initial value @xmath75 to a final value @xmath76 and then decreased from @xmath76 to @xmath75 in a very small step ( @xmath77 ) . the last computed cyclic point for a given value of @xmath1",
    "is always used as a new initial value for the next value of @xmath1 . starting with initial conditions @xmath78 at @xmath75 , system ( [ e2 ] ) is integrated , using the standard runge kutta algorithm  @xcite , for @xmath79 periods of the driving force until the transient has died out",
    "; the trajectories expected are attractors and the local calculation error is sufficiently small . then to find out whether the trajectory is periodic ( quasiperiodic ) or chaotic , the system is integrated for the next @xmath80 periods in order to catch the maximum of coexisting attractors .",
    "this procedure allows us to make sure that coexisting attractors are realised due to different initial conditions which are handed throughout from one parameter to another .",
    "we chose @xmath81 and @xmath82 for all examples in the subsequent section .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams obtained here show the projection of the attractors in the poincar section onto @xmath83 or @xmath84 versus the control parameter @xmath1 and for different values of @xmath0 . in a one - dimensional double - well duffing oscillator",
    "[ 19 - 21,23 - 27 ] , it is shown that chaotic solutions arise through quasiperiodic , period - doubling cascade with a sequence of symmetry - breaking and saddle - nodes .",
    "hopf bifurcations have not been found , but are abundant in our model .",
    "+ we computed a great number of diagrams , and some of them showing the main features of the system are presented in figures 2 - 4 .",
    "it is important to note that no hysteresis has been detected while checking all these diagrams .",
    "we can therefore avoid any confusion over the periods of attractors when reading this type of diagram ; for instance one single period-2 yields to 2 points for one frequency value whereas two coexisting attractors each of period-1 also yield to two points for one frequency .",
    "these diagrams show a great number of coexisting attractors ( chaotic domains ) intermingled with imbricated windows made up of periodic solutions of different periodicity , period - doubling of both types , sudden chaos and hopf bifurcation . the so called chaotic domains ( or chaotic sea )",
    "will be characterized in the following section .",
    "+ at lowest frequencies ( @xmath85 ) quasiperiodic as well as chaotic solutions occur together with a number of symmetry - breaking ( sb ) , period doubling ( pd ) and saddle - nodes ( sn ) . in fig.2(a ) where @xmath86 , it appears in the neighborhood of @xmath87 , 6 pairs of sb followed by 3 reversed pd till the chaotic domain .",
    "when the driving force is increased @xmath88 , overlapping pd cascade and sn appear as can be seen in fig.2(b ) .",
    "similar features as in the latter case are also observed for small values of @xmath0 ( @xmath89 ) . in other ranges of the driving frequency",
    "bigger than @xmath90 the aformentioned features still exist and additional ones such as resonances and hopf bifurcations appear in the system ; the results are displayed in figures 3 and 4 . in figure 3",
    "it can be seen throughout overlapping pd cascade of both types , sb , resonances ( r ) and even sudden chaos ( sc ) . when @xmath91 in fig.3(f ) at @xmath92 , period-8 attractor undergoes reversed period - doubling cascade and period-2 is created as from @xmath93 . besides , for @xmath94 appear resonances ( r ) in fig.3(a , b , d , e ) , fig.6(a ) and sudden chaos in fig.3(c ) .",
    "however in fig.4 when @xmath0 becomes much larger and @xmath95 , hopf bifurcation ( h ) is abundant and often appear more than once at a given frequency .",
    "this notation @xmath96 means that there are @xmath97 , ( @xmath98 ) , integer hopf bifurcation at a given frequency .",
    "one can therefore observe -h- in ( a ) , -3h- in ( b ) , -2h- .. -2h- in ( c , d ) , -2h- .. -3h- .. -2h- in ( e , f ) and -3h-3h- in ( g , h ) . in fig.4(h ) for instance , at @xmath99 , a period-6 attractor undergoes reversed period - doubling to become a period-3 ; next after 3 pairs of symmetry - breaking near @xmath100 , appears again period-3 attractor as from @xmath101 .",
    "and then at @xmath102 this attractor of period-3 undergoes 3 hopf bifurcations .",
    "windows of periodic solutions separated by quasiperiodic ones are clearly visible .",
    "the poincar cross - section of quasiperiodic attractors of this kind ( -3h- ) consists of three invariant tori ( destroyed or not ) .",
    "thus at any @xmath6 where @xmath96 exist , the projection of the attractor corresponds to @xmath97  tori on the poincar cross - section .",
    "the torus attractor arises from hopf bifurcation which is a bifurcation from a fixed point to an invariant curve . at the transition to quasiperiodic motion ,",
    "this fixed point ( projection of the limit cycle in to the cross - section ) loses its stability and gives birth to an invariant circle , which is a cross - section of the torus in the flow .",
    "the three pairs of sb appearing at the neigborhood of @xmath100 ( fig.4(g , h ) ) seem to be apparently a window of period-6 attractor .",
    "in fact it is just a period-3 attractor as can be illustrated further in fig.8(b).this orbit , born asymmetrically , coexists with its inversion symmetric orbit of the same period-3 and are caught simultaneously .",
    "+ next we pursue our investigation for large values of @xmath6 ( @xmath103 ) and for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the features observed so far have disappeared and the system becomes regular providing attractors with a small number of periods as can be seen in figure 5 .",
    "the phase diagrams which often show bifurcations , curves , surfaces and which is out of the scope of this paper could also help to match the features obtained in this analysis .",
    "to better support the results obtained above , we intend in this section to characterize chaotic behavior . for this purpose",
    "some indicators are used namely the lyapunov exponents and the power spectrum density . also , poincar cross - sections and phase portraits are shown to illustrate some attractors present in the system .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is one of the most important tools for understanding chaotic behavior , obtained by examining  a very sensitive dependence of initial conditions \" .",
    "in particular it is generally well established that a rigorous measure of chaos may be given in terms of lyapunov spectrum of the dynamical system .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent is characteric of chaos while zero and negative values of the exponent signify a marginally stable or quasiperiodic orbit and periodic orbit , respectively .",
    "solving numerically the variational equation ( [ e4 ] ) together with system ( [ e2 ] ) we calculate the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath104 in the poincare cross - section with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "the spectrum is displayed in fig.6 together with a bifurcation diagram .",
    "windows of chaotic domains and periodic solutions are clearly justified .",
    "power spectrum density using fast fourier transformation ( fft ) has also been computed with some values from fig.6 for a periodic solution ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) and a chaotic solution ( @xmath109,@xmath108 ) ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "fig.8 shows the phase portraits and poincar cross - section . in fig.8(a , b ) plotted are the phase portraits , related to fig.4(g , h ) , showing a period-3 attractor for @xmath110 , @xmath111(a ) and a coexistence of two asymmetric attractors , each of period-3 for @xmath110 , @xmath112 ( b ) .",
    "the dots ( @xmath113 ) represent the corresponding points in the poincar cross - sections . in fig.8(c , d ) two chaotic attractors are plotted in the poincar cross - section for @xmath114 , @xmath115 and for @xmath116 , @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we observe in fig.8(e , f ) three @xmath2 tori doubling at @xmath117 , @xmath110 and at @xmath118 , @xmath86 , two @xmath2 tori doubling ( destroyed ) corresponding for -3h- and -2h- , respectively ( values from fig.4(c , h ) ) . in the torus route to chaos , the original torus appears to split into two circles at the torus doubling bifurcation point .",
    "this route is reminiscent to the period - doubling route to chaos , although there are finite number of torus doublings before the onset of chaos motion .",
    "also , the torus doubling route to chaos is a higher - dimensional phenomenon , requiring at least a four - dimensional flow , or a three - dimensional map . it is not observed in one - dimensional maps , unlike the period - doubling route to chaos  @xcite .",
    "to sum up we have investigated coupled double - well duffing oscillators subjected to a periodic driving force .",
    "our main conclusion is that the shape of the potential in the coupled duffing oscillators system has a profound influence on the routes to chaos taken by the system . by a linear analysis",
    "we have examined the stability of the steady state of the system leading to different types of bifurcation likely to appear for @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 $ ] . with the help of bifurcation diagrams",
    ", it has been shown that the bifurcation structure , which is complicated , depends strongly on the values of the control parameter @xmath1 . for a simple electronic realization of our model ,",
    "it is obvious that the oscillators may be very difficult to control for small values of @xmath1 due to the large windows for chaos .",
    "this system becomes regular for large values of @xmath1 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "apart from the routes already encountered in a one - dimensional double - well duffing oscillator such as quasiperiodic and period - doubling cascade , sudden chaos and mostly hopf bifurcations have been newly found in this work . besides , resonances ( r ) , imbricated sb , sn , pd intermingled by chaotic domains",
    "are observed , rending the structure highly chaotic .",
    "two and three @xmath2  tori doubling , have been also observed . to characterize chaotic behavior of this system , lyapunov exponents and the power spectrum density using fft",
    "have been employed .",
    "poincar cross - sections and phase portraits have been also used for better visualisation of periodic and chaotic attractors .",
    "an analytical approach using approximative technics could be an interesting topic for future work , and would probably shed further light on the rich behaviour of this model .",

    "<S> in addition to the well known routes to chaos already encountered in a one - dimensional duffing oscillator , our model exhibits imbricated period - doubling of both types , symmetry - breaking , sudden chaos and a great abundance of hopf bifurcations , many of which occur more than once for a given driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the chaotic behaviour of our model using two indicators , namely lyapunov exponents and the power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> poincar cross - sections and phase portraits are also plotted to show the manifestation of coexisting periodic and chaotic attractors including the destruction of @xmath2 tori doubling . </S>"
