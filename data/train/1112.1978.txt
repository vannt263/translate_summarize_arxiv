    "in data privacy , the assessment of risk is one of the elements of major importance . at present ,",
    "several approaches have been studied in the literature .",
    "the major approaches are k - anonymity  , reidentification   and differential privacy  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on two of them : reidentification and @xmath1-anonymity .",
    "the former evaluates the disclosure risk of a protected data set measuring the chances that an intruder can link his information and the one in the protected data set .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1-anonymity tries to avoid any reidentification , producing a protected data set where each record is cloaked into a set of other @xmath3 records .    in this work",
    "we formalize the reidentification process and we use this formalization to discuss the concept of @xmath1-anonymity and then propose the concept of @xmath0-confusion .",
    "we also prove that @xmath0-confusion is a generalization of @xmath1-anonymity .",
    "then , we discuss the application of the concept of @xmath1-anonymity to graphs . at present , due to the interest of online social networks , several authors have studied data protection for graphs .",
    "it is relevant here to consider the works in  , in which alternative definitions of @xmath1-anonymity for graphs have been presented . in this work",
    "we discuss these different definitions and we show that the definition in  @xcite have severe weaknesses . then , we first provide an alternative definition for @xmath1-anonymity that provides enough security at the cost of being quite restrictive , and later the definition of @xmath2-anonymity , a relaxation of the former one .",
    "the paper discusses several properties of the definitions . in particular",
    ", we study the characterization of the @xmath1-anonymous graphs .",
    "we also provide algorithms for transforming a graph into a @xmath1-anonymized one , for calculating the degree of @xmath2-anonymity of a graph given @xmath1 , and to increase the @xmath4 of the @xmath2-anonymity of a graph .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] discusses disclosure risk on online social networks focusing on reidentification and @xmath1-anonymity .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] reviews previous approaches of @xmath1-anonymity for graphs , and presents an attack for the approach introduced in  @xcite .",

    "section  [ sec:5 ] presents a relaxation @xmath2-anonymity .",
    "section  [ sec:6 ] includes the algorithms that we have developed related to @xmath2-anonymity .",
    "the paper finishes with the conclusions .",
    "in this section we first present a formal framework for evaluating disclosure risk in data privacy in general ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "then we will focus on disclosure risk for online social networks .",
    "a database is a collection of records of data . in this article",
    "we will suppose that all records correspond to distinct individuals or objects .",
    "every record has a unique identifier and is divided into attributes .",
    "the attributes can be very specific , as the attributes `` height '' or `` gender '' , or more general , as the attributes `` text '' or `` sequence of binary numbers '' .",
    "suppose that the database can be represented as a single table .",
    "let the records be the rows of the table and let the attributes be the columns .",
    "the intersection of a row and an attribute is a cell in the table , and we call the data in the cells the entries of the database",
    ".    let @xmath5 be a table with @xmath0 records and @xmath6 attributes .",
    "we define the partition set @xmath7 of @xmath5 to be the set of subsets of the underlying set of entries of @xmath5 , @xmath8.$ ]    [ 1:def : methodanonymization ] a method for anonymization of databases is any transformation or operator @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a space of databases .",
    "then @xmath11 , given a database @xmath12 , returns a database @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath13 is a database , all entries in @xmath13 will correspond to a unique individual or object , which we will suppose to be the same individuals as the ones behind the records in @xmath12 .",
    "usually it is assumed that there is , in some sense , less sensible information about the individuals behind the records in @xmath12 in the transformed database @xmath13 than there was in the original database @xmath12 .    [ 1:def : reidentification ] let @xmath11 be a method for anonymization of databases , @xmath12 a table with @xmath0 records indexed by @xmath14 in the space of tables @xmath10 and @xmath15 the anonymization of @xmath12 using @xmath11 .",
    "then a re - identification method is a function that given a collection of entries @xmath16 in @xmath17 and some additional information from a space of auxiliary informations @xmath18 , returns the probability that @xmath16 correspond to entries from the record with index @xmath19 , @xmath20^{n}\\\\\\\\ & ( y , a ) & \\mapsto & \\left(p(y\\mbox { correspond to entries from } x[i ] ) : i\\in i\\right ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ] consider the objective probability distribution corresponding to the re - identification problem .",
    "then , we require from a re - identification method that it returns a probability distribution that is compatible with this probability , also after missing some relevant information .",
    "compatibility can be modeled in terms of compatibility of belief functions ( see ) .    in this definition ,",
    "the probability @xmath21 could have been expressed as conditioned by @xmath22 .",
    "however , in this article we prefer to use the notation above .",
    "compatibility implies that the more evidence we have , the less entropy the probability has .",
    "because of that , the method returns @xmath23 if it has no evidence of the original record corresponding to the protected record @xmath16 , and that , as the evidence increases , the probabilities of the corresponding indices are agumented .",
    "an example of this situation is when the variables of a data set are protected independently by means of k - anonymity .",
    "then , re - identification can be applied to protected data using only some of the attributes .",
    "the distributions computed by these methods should be compatible with the ones considered when all attributes are taken into account .",
    "when no attribute is considered , the algorithm should lead to the probability @xmath23 .    in this way we avoid re - identification methods with false positives , since these would disturb the rest of the discussion .",
    "also , probabilities are assumed to be defined so that the same value will apply to different protected records whenever these have the same value .",
    "a common assumption is to consider that re - identification occurs when the probability function that is returned by the re - identification method takes the value 1 at one index , say at @xmath24 , and the value 0 at all the other indices .",
    "that is , given the auxiliary information @xmath22 there is probability 1 that @xmath16 belongs to the record with index @xmath24 in @xmath12 .",
    "we say that the entries @xmath25 are linked to a collection of indices @xmath26 if the probabilities that are returned by the re - identification method take non - zero values over the indices @xmath27 and are zero on the complement @xmath28 . in a nice and regular situation ,",
    "a possible non - zero value for the re - identification method over @xmath27 is then @xmath29 .    here",
    ", auxiliary information denotes any information used to achieve a better performance of the re - identification process .",
    "it is common that researchers use parts of the original database @xmath12 as such auxiliary information .",
    "one can however argue that for example knowledge of the method of anonymization is also auxiliary information .",
    "when the database covers only part of a population , and it is not known who is in the database , then information about individuals that are not in the original database can serve as auxiliary information . in general , we do not assume that the auxiliary information can be indexed by individuals or that it has any particular structure at all .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    the space of auxiliary information contains any information that could be useful and accessible to the adversary .",
    "examples of auxiliary information is information in the public domain and information on the method that was used in order to anonymize the data .",
    "a bad determination of @xmath18 could imply that the confusion of a re - identification method is overestimated .",
    "we have assumed that we know who is in the database and who is not .",
    "it can be proved that , under this assumption , any additional information that is useful for a re - identification method can be deduced from the original database @xmath12 .",
    "hence , in this particular case , we may assume that @xmath34 .",
    "[ def : ntconfusion ] given a space of databases @xmath10 , a space of auxiliary information @xmath18 and a method of anonymization of databases @xmath11 , we say that @xmath11 provides @xmath35-confusion if for all re - identification methods @xmath30 , and all anonymized databases @xmath36 the confusion of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath37 and @xmath18 is larger or equal to @xmath0 for the fixed threshold @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath35-confusion therefore measures the smallest cardinality of a set of individuals for which the re - identification methods gives probability higher than @xmath39 , calculated for all protected registers @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath35-confusion is more reliable as a measure of anonymity when @xmath0 and @xmath39 are both large , simultaneously .",
    "that is , an anonymization method providing @xmath41-confusion is better or equal than one that provides @xmath35-confusion when @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this statement is based on the following observations .    on the one hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is small , then an adversary might be able to form a collusion of size @xmath44 which could break the anonymity of the @xmath0th register .",
    "this issue is analogous to what we get if we implement @xmath1-anonymity with a small @xmath1 .    on the other hand , it is interesting to observe what may occur if the threshold @xmath39 is much smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "for example , say that we apply all available re - identification methods to the protected record @xmath16 .",

    "then we have @xmath35-confusion with @xmath49 . to avoid this issue",
    ", an adequate value for @xmath39 could be approximately @xmath50 .",
    "next we present a proposal for a definition of @xmath0-confusion .",
    "let notations be as in definition  [ def : ntconfusion ] .",
    "we say that the anonymization method @xmath11 provides @xmath0-confusion if there is a @xmath51 such that @xmath11 provides @xmath35-confusion .",
    "this definition of @xmath0-confusion is designed so that @xmath0 will be the measure of the smallest number of indices in @xmath52 for which the result is a non - zero probability , when applying a re - identification method to a protected record in @xmath37 . in this way ,",
    "anonymization methods for which re - identification returns very distinct probabilities also provide @xmath0-confusion , whenever at least @xmath0 of these probabilities are non - zero for every protected record .",
    "this mimics @xmath1-anonymity in the sense that in order to re - identify an individual with absolute certainty , a collusion of the @xmath3 other target individuals is necessary .",
    "other possible approaches are to consider that a table satisfies @xmath0-confusion    * when the highest value of the best re - identification method is taken at least @xmath0 times , for every protected record @xmath16 and all auxiliary information ; * when the highest value of the best re - identification method is at most @xmath45 .",
    "the concept of @xmath1-anonymity   encompasses a set of techniques for data protection that try to avoid reidentification risk .",
    "when protecting a database , we have @xmath1-anonymity when a record is cloaked into a set of other @xmath3 records .",
    "thus , given the record of the intruder , reidentification always returns @xmath1 indistinguishable records .",
    "we use the notation @xmath53 to say that @xmath5 is a table with the set of attributes @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a set of attributes of the table .",
    "we denote the projection of the table on the attributes @xmath55 by @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "we suppose that every record contains information about a unique individual .",
    "an identifier @xmath14 in a database is an attribute such that it uniquely identifies the individuals behind the records . in particular ,",
    "any entry in @xmath57 $ ] is unique .",
    "a quasi - identifier @xmath58 in the database is a collection of attributes @xmath59 that belongs to the public domain ( i.e. are known to an adversary ) , such that they in combination can uniquely , or almost uniquely , identify a record @xcite .",
    "that is , the structure of the table allows for the possibility that an entry in @xmath60 $ ] is unique , or that there are only a small number of equal entries . in the former case",
    "the entry in @xmath60 $ ] uniquely identifies the individual behind the record and in the latter , the few other individuals with the same entries in @xmath60 $ ] may form a collusion and use secret information about themselves in order to make this identification possible .",
    "the former case may be formalized as follows .",
    "consider the table @xmath61 obtained by permuting randomly the records of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath62 be an element in @xmath7 such that the entries of @xmath62 all belong to the same record in @xmath61 ( and therefore also in @xmath5 ) .",
    "then , if there is a method of reidentification @xmath63^n$ ] such that @xmath64=1 $ ] for some @xmath65 and one index @xmath47 , then @xmath62 belongs to @xmath60 $ ] .    in the latter case ,",
    "an @xmath62 such that @xmath66 is large for a small subset @xmath27 of indices and 0 for the others ( so that @xmath62 is linked to @xmath27 ) would also belong to @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "if a table contains information on students in a school class , the attributes birth data and gender could be sufficient to determine to which individual a record of the table corresponds , although it is possible that not all records will be uniquely identified in this way .",
    "hence for this table , birth date and gender are an example of a quasi - identifier .",
    "the following definition of @xmath1-anonymity appeared for the first time in  @xcite ( see also the articles by samarati  @xcite and sweeney @xcite ) .",
    "[ 1:def : nan ] a table @xmath5 , that represents a database and has associated quasi - identifier @xmath58 , is @xmath1-anonymous if every sequence in @xmath60 $ ] appears with at least @xmath1 occurrences in @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "we have the following relation between @xmath1-anonymity and @xmath0-confusion .",

    "let @xmath11 be a method of anonymization of databases that gives @xmath1-anonymity with respect to @xmath58 .",
    "then there is a threshold @xmath67 such that any method of reidentification @xmath30 is of confusion at least @xmath1 with respect to @xmath37 , @xmath30 , and @xmath39 , so that @xmath11 provides @xmath1-confusion .",
    "let @xmath12 be a table with records indexed by @xmath14 and @xmath15 a table that is @xmath1-anonymous with respect to @xmath58 , obtained by applying the anonymization method @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the assumption that our knowledge on @xmath18 has permitted us to determine correctly the quasi - identifier @xmath58 , implies that we may express the auxiliary information as the restriction of the original table to the quasi - identifier , @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "then any reidentification method @xmath69^{|i|}$ ] will take values @xmath21 in which at least @xmath1 entries @xmath48 $ ] are equal to @xmath70 with @xmath71 and the other entries are smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "define @xmath39 as the minimum among all these @xmath70 .",
    "then the confusion of @xmath30 is at least @xmath1 , for the threshold @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath12 was any table and @xmath30 any method of reidentification , @xmath11 provides @xmath1-confusion .",
    "in some cases the threshold for a @xmath1-anonymous table will be @xmath73 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : anonym - confusion ] shows that any table that satisfies @xmath1-anonymity also satisfy @xmath0-confusion with @xmath74 .",
    "the converse is not true , that is , a table that satisfies @xmath0-confusion does not necessarily satisfy @xmath0-anonymity .",
    "next we will see an example of this .",
    "let @xmath12 be a numerical table with 30 distinct records ( points ) in @xmath75 .",
    "suppose that we want to anonymize @xmath12 according to @xmath1-anonymity with @xmath76 .",
    "a common approach for achieving @xmath1-anonymity is to apply a clustering algorithm to the table , see for example  @xcite .",
    "a clustering algorithm returns a partition of the records so that the records in each class of the partition are in some sense similar . in this case",
    "the clustering algorithm returns a partition of the record set in 10 classes with exactly 3 records in each class , so that these records are points inside a ball of radius @xmath30 from the average of the three points .",
    "given the records ( points ) @xmath77 , let @xmath78 represent their average , and @xmath79 represent the normalized vector that is perpendicular to the plane defined by the points @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 represent the points in the cluster of the point @xmath82 .",
    "two alternatives are considered for the definition of a @xmath83-anonymization of @xmath12 .    1 .",
    "replace @xmath84 by @xmath85 ; 2 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the three points in a cluster @xmath87 .",
    "replace @xmath82 by @xmath88 , @xmath89 by @xmath90 and @xmath91 by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a positive real number smaller than the radius @xmath30 of the ball that contains the points in the cluster @xmath87 .",
    "then , the first alternative satisfies both @xmath83-anonymity and @xmath94-confusion .",
    "however , the second alternative does not satisfy @xmath83-anonymity , but it does satisfy @xmath94-confusion .      a graph is a pair @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a set of vertices and @xmath97 is a family of 2-subsets of @xmath96 called edges .",
    "sometimes there is associated an additional information to a vertex or to an edge .",
    "such information is called a label .",
    "graphs can be used to represent for example a social network . in the common approach for representing a social network as a graph ,",
    "individuals are represented as vertices , information about relations between individuals is represented as edges and other information about the individuals or about the relations is represented as labels .",
    "the concept of @xmath1-anonymity was initially defined for tables . in order to apply @xmath1-anonymity to other data structures ,",
    "observe that these can be represented in table form .",
    "for example , when applying @xmath1-anonymity to graphs , the adjacency matrix of the graph is a representation of the graph in table form .",
    "the adjacency matrix of a graph is a matrix in which both the rows and the columns are indexed by the vertices of the graph and the entries represent the number of edges between the corresponding vertices .",
    "a table is obtained by taking the rows and the columns of the matrix to be the records and the attributes of the table , respectively .",
    "then every vertex of the graph occurs as an index of a record in the table and the attributes indicate the existence of edges to the other vertices . depending on the situation , what is considered to be interesting information about the graph may vary .",
    "therefore , other attributes may be included in the table , like for example the degree of the vertices .",
    "the information given by the adjacency matrix is however enough to deduce any other information available about the graph .",
    "there are also other representations of graphs that contain the same information as the table just described .",
    "one example is the incidence matrix , in which the rows are indexed by the vertices , the columns are indexed by the edges and the entries indicate if the correponding vertex is on the corresponding edge .",
    "as we saw in the previous section , the concept of @xmath1-anonymity is based on the existence of a quasi - identifier .",
    "a quasi - identifier is a collection of attributes of the table , and the quality of the anonymization of the table depends on the correct determination of the quasi - identifier . usually it is the data owner who is the entity that executes the anonymization method and who therefore is the responsible for the correct determination of the quasi - identifier . in this process , the data owner must consider a table form representation of the graph .",
    "the choice of attributes for this table is of course crucial for the determination of the quasi - identifier .",
    "the data owner can not know in advance which information may be useful for the adversary .",
    "for example , the adversary could use the edge set of the vertices for the reidentification process , or he could use only the degree of the vertices . in the former example the adversary uses exactly the information given by the adjacency matrix , and in the latter example he uses information that can be derived from the adjacency matrix , and that can be attacked to the table as an additional attribute .",
    "a prudent data owner should assume that the table that represents the graph , and which serves for the determination of the quasi - identifier , contains all attributes that may be relevant for a reidentification intent of an adversary .",
    "we observe that this will occur exactly when the table that is defined for the adjacency matrix ( or some other equivalent table ) is @xmath1-anonymized ! this is so , because all other information about the graph can be deduced from this table .",
    "previous authors on this subject seem to agree on the opinion that @xmath1-anonymization for graphs differs from @xmath1-anonymization of tables .",
    "this opinion complicates the application of the concept of @xmath1-anonymity to graphs .",
    "we argue that graph @xmath1-anonymity is a special case of @xmath1-anonymity as defined by sweeney .",
    "below we list the arguments used in @xcite to justify the difference between @xmath1-anonymization of table form data and graph data .    1 .",
    "they claim that it is much more challenging to model the background knowledge of adversaries and attacks about social network data than that about relational data . on relational data ,",
    "they say , it is often assumed that a set of attributes serving a quasi - identifier is used to associate data from multiple tables , and attacks mainly come from identifying individuals from the quasi - identifier .",
    "however , in a social network many pieces of information can be used to identify individuals , such as labels of vertices and edges , neighborhood graphs , induced subgraphs , and their combinations .",
    "it is much more complicated and much more difficult than the relational case .",
    "they also claim that is much more challenging to measure the information loss in anonymizing social network data than that in anonymizing relational data .",
    "3 .   finally , they claim that it is much more difficult to anonymize a social network than data in table form , since changing labels of vertices and edges may affect the neighborhoods of other vertices , and removing or adding vertices and edges may affect other vertices and edges as well as the properties of the network .",
    "observe that only the first point is relevant for the definition of @xmath1-anonymity , since it focus on the choice of quasi - identifier , at least if we consider this choice to form part of the definition of @xmath1-anonymity for graphs .",
    "the second and the third points are only important when defining an algorithm for @xmath1-anonymization of graphs . in particular",
    "the third point is of a completely practical nature .",
    "also , it is important to realize that every kind of data has its peculiarities . also relational table data can hide unexpected quasi - identifiers , caused by the origin of the data .",
    "trajectorial data can be tricky , when anonymizing car trajectories it is important to check that the published trajectories are feasible . for example , a car can not drive over a lake .",
    "for graphs we have a similar situation . when anonymizing a graph it is important to check that we do not produce edges which contain only one vertex . concluding , we see that the anonymization algorithm must take into account the underlying structure of the data type that is being anonymized .    regarding the first point , we have seen in the previous discussion that all available information about a graph can be deduced from its adjacency matrix .",
    "this implies that if the matrix is @xmath1-anonymous , so is the graph , with respect to any graph property that can come in mind .",
    "we will here make some remarks on @xmath0-confusion for graphs , although we spare a more detailed discussion on this subject for future work .",
    "the concept of @xmath0-confusion generalizes @xmath1-anonymity , and permits to define methods of anonymization that do not provide @xmath1-anonymity , but that do provide the same level of anonymity as does @xmath1-anonymity .",
    "the main interest is then to minimize information loss . just as for any table data",
    ", @xmath0-confusion can be used for privacy protection of data from social networks .",
    "we can separate data that is representable in graph form , from data that is not . then",
    "a sketch for a family of methods of anonymization could be the following :    1 .",
    "transform the graph data into a @xmath1-anonymous graph ; 2 .",
    "observe that the @xmath1-anonymous graph provides a partition of the vertex set ( see section  [ sec:4 ] ) , hence defining a clustering of the records . now",
    "apply a method of anonymization providing @xmath0-confusion with @xmath98 to the every cluster independently .",
    "it is not hard to see ( remembering that @xmath1-anonymity is a special case of @xmath0-confusion ) , that the result is a method of anonymization that provides @xmath0-confusion with @xmath98 .",
    "suitable methods of anonymization could be the following :    * data distortion by probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "this is a special case of synthetic data generation , in which the protected data is generated from what is determined to be the probability distribution of the original data .",
    "it is very important that the data generator provides non - reversible anonymity ( as it is supposed to do ) .",
    "otherwise , the result will not satisfy @xmath0-confusion .",
    "in particular , one should be careful with methods that generate data with the same statistics as the original data , since too many restrictions may lead to a determined system of equations , and consequently , reversible anonymity .",
    "the exact characterization of data generators that provides non - reversible anonymity is still to determine .",
    "observe that although the new data asymptotically preserves statistics locally , if no further actions are taken , all global statistics will not be preserved .",
    "also observe that if the clusters are small , then local statistics may not be preserved .",
    "+ the idea to combine a first step of clustering with a second step of data generation within the clusters , has previously been studied for non - graph data in @xcite and @xcite , section 4 . * data swapping . in this case",
    ", we suggest that all data should be uniformely scrambled , attribute by attribute . then it is clear that the result satisfies @xmath0-confusion .",
    "also , some of both the global and the local statistics are preserved , since the data entries are the same as the original data entries .",
    "future work includes an evaluation of the information loss .",
    "possible relaxations could be discussed in order to lower the information loss .",
    "previous applications of @xmath1-anonymity to graphs have suggested several different quasi - identifiers , resulting in different definitions of @xmath1-anonymity for graphs .",
    "these definitions compete , and no agreement has been reached .",
    "we review some of the available definitions here below .",
    "hay et al .",
    "@xcite explore the potential of structural queries on graphs for the reidentification of vertices and propose a formalization of the graph anonymization problem based on @xmath1-anonymity . given a graph @xmath99 and an anonymization of it , @xmath100 , they let an adversary post queries on the structure of @xmath101 in a neigborhood of a fixed vertex @xmath102 .",

    "this partition is easy to find .",
    "the row vectors ( or , equivalently , the column vectors ) of the adjacency matrix of the graph represent the neighbor set of their corresponding vertex , so that the vertices in the same class of a @xmath1-anonymous graph will have equal row vectors ( and column vectors ) .",

    "we require that the clustering algorithm returns a partition of the vertex set @xmath96 of the graph and that each cluster or class of vertices contains at least @xmath1 vertices . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use simulated annealing in order to find a partition of the vertices that satisfy @xmath1-anonymity and minimizes information loss , via a maximum likelihood approach .",
    "heuristic methods are nice , because they work .",
    "however , other methods may offer more theoretical control over the properties of the output of the algorithm .    in order to obtain good clustering results",
    "the choice of the distance to use is crucial .",
    "not only classical distances are used for clustering , but also weaker topology concepts , like similarities  @xcite and proximity relations  @xcite .",

    "in particular , two similarities for clustering of the neighbor sets of the vertices of a graph are compared ; the manhattan similarity , based on the manhattan distance , and the so - called 2-path similarity .",
    "the manhattan similarity measures how many equal entries the two vertices have in the adjacency matrix .",
    "formally , we have the following definition .    given two vectors in the adjacency matrix of @xmath101 , @xmath231 , we denote by @xmath232 the manhattan or @xmath233 similarity between @xmath119 and @xmath104 , so that @xmath234-v[i]|.\\ ] ]    the 2-path similarity measures the number of paths of length 2 between the two vertices .",
    "this can be calculated by taking the square of the adjacency matrix , and we define the 2-path similarity in this manner .    given two vectors in the adjacency matrix of @xmath101 , @xmath231 , we denote by @xmath235 the 2-path similarity between @xmath119 and @xmath104 , so that @xmath236v[i].\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note how two vertices that share many neighbors have many paths of length two between them , or , expressed in another way , they have many quadrangles that passes through them .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the manhattan similarity measures the similarity between vertices with respect to both neighbors and non - neighbors , while the 2-path similarity only measures the similarity between vertices with respect to their neighbors , so that a common non - neighbor does not change the similarity between two vertices .",
    "the differences between these two similarities should be compared with the differences between the two definitions of @xmath237-anonymity in definition  [ def : klanonymvk1 ] and definition  [ def : klanonymvk2 ] .",
    "algorithm  [ alg:2 ] and algorithm  [ alg:3 ] illustrates the connection between the similarities and the definitions of @xmath2-anonymity .",
    "a clustered graph can be published as a generalized graph as described in @xcite .",
    "when the graph is @xmath1-anonymous , it is possible to publish a generalization of the graph that satisfies @xmath1-anonymity , without any information loss at all .",
    "this is indeed the idea behind @xmath1-anonymity for graphs .",
