    "recently , graphene has attracted many attentions because it has shown the ability to make a transition from the semiconductivity to the superconductivity state @xcite . for example",
    ", some investigations have shown that graphene with ( effective ) vacancy disorder is a physical representative of dirty d - wave superconductors .",
    "also , the density of states ( dos ) of this system has been obtained numerically and within the self - consistent t - matrix approximation ( sctma ) in the presence of vacancies @xcite . besides , some studies investigated the quantum size effects in armchair graphene nano - ribbons ( agnr ) with hydrogen termination using density functional theory ( dft ) in kohn - sham formulation .",
    "they have obtained the electronic structure of this system and predicted a threefold periodicity of the excitation gap with ribbon width @xcite . in another paper",
    ", it has been argued that the best way for creating the superconductor in temperature of room is a constructing of a wormhole inside the graphene @xcite .",
    "a graphene wormhole is composed of a short nanotube which behaves like a bridge between two different graphene layers .",
    "other papers have discussed that graphene can be applied as a platform to demonstrate a wormhole for electrons .",
    "they have shown that two properly designed graphene - based nanomaterials can effectively annihilate one another from an electronic point of view , and similar to a wormhole , lead to the delocalization of the wave - function stationary states @xcite . and in more recent works , it has been shown that the wormhole in graphene can be produced by joining photons that exchange between atoms and acts similar to nano - bion in m - theory .",
    "this bionic wormhole is formed by decreasing the separation distance between layers of graphene and enhancing the cooper hopping pairing between them . also , it has been argued that external magnetic field produces a new bion which causes losing the energy density of initial - bion between two layers and disappearing the superconductivity @xcite .",
    "now , the question arises how curvature of graphene changes during its evolution from semiconductor to superconductor ? we will show that during this transition , higher order of curvature scalars are produced and @xmath0 gravity emerges .",
    "in cosmology , the shape of @xmath0 gravity , which is the main cause of evolution of universe , has been determined @xcite .",
    "for example , it was argued that for producing the bounce cosmology , the @xmath0 gravity should have the function with positive rational numbers powers of the ricci scalar ( @xmath1 ) in the large cosmic time regime and a gauss hyper geometric function in the small cosmic time @xcite .",
    "some other authors found that the @xmath0 gravity which creates the super - bounce has the form @xmath2 at the large- curvature regime and @xmath3 at the small - curvature regime @xcite .",
    "also , it has been discussed that a type iv singular bounce can be produced by the @xmath0 gravity which has the form @xmath4 near the singularity@xcite .",
    "some other authors have proposed a mechanism that allows to reconcile dark energy models with @xmath0 theories and determines the shape of @xmath0 which leads to the same hubble parameter of the given quintessence model and astrophysical data @xcite . in another paper ,",
    "authors have obtained the relations between the model independent results and parameters coming from cosmography and the theoretically motivated assumptions of @xmath0 cosmology @xcite . in another scenario , authors considered the electrically charged black holes in the palatine formalism of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "they have shown that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the planck curvature may lead to different geometrical structures in terms of inner horizon for black holes @xcite . in another investigation , some authors have shown that palatini @xmath0 gravity yields a geometry in which point like singularity of space - time in four dimensional classical scenarios is replaced by a finite size wormhole structure . in fact , this theory causes to the emergence of nonsingular space - time , despite the existence of curvature divergences at the wormhole throat @xcite . in another research",
    ", authors discussed that microscopic wormholes which are produced in modified gravity theories like @xmath0 gravity play a role analogous to that of defects in crystals .",
    "this illustrates how lessons from solid state physics can be used in modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "finally , authors studied the metric - affine scenarios where an action in modified gravity theories like @xmath0 gravity is generated by electrovacuum fields in a three dimensional space - time .",
    "such models are can be applied in crystalline structures with microscopic defects and , in particular , those that may be effectively behaved as bi - dimensional ( like graphene ) @xcite . extending these results to the graphene",
    ", we propose a new model which considers the process of formation of an special @xmath0 gravity as due to defects which its shape depends on the shape of defects and the number of atoms in graphene . in usual",
    "graphene , each carbon has four electrons which bound to three electrons of other atoms and one electron is free .",
    "this electron may move along the sheet of graphene and produces the conductivity .",
    "however , in this system , the curvature produced by non - identical fermions is neutralized by the curvature of identical fermions and total curvature of system is zero .",
    "the curvature has a direct relation with energy momentum and thus sum over applied momentum on electron is zero .",
    "this means that free electrons do nt move in a certain path and no have any effect on conductivity . by entering defects , for some angles between sides ,",
    "anti - parallel spins become close to each other and curvature produced by their couplings will be more respect to curvature produced by parallel spins . in these conditions ,",
    "one momentum is applied to free electrons and leads to their motion in one special path and consequently , the superconductivity emerges . for some other angles ,",
    "parallel spins become close to each other and repel each other . for these defects ,",
    "a new @xmath0 gravity emerges that shape of it is different from previous state .",
    "also , the couplings of anti - parallel spins in curvatures are removed and the sign of curvatures reverses which is a signature of anti - gravity in this system .",
    "+ in this paper , we will use of m - theory language to describe complex systems such as graphene .",
    "maybe the question arises that what is the advantage of using that approach ? in the description of graphene and its properties ,",
    "one just needs standard fields such as fermions , scalars , and gauge bosons . to answer this question",
    ", we should say that only in m - theory , we can consider the origin of pauli exclusion principle which has the main role in conducting of free electrons and show that the reason for attractive force between anti - parallel spins is the appearance of gravity between them and the repelling force between parallel spins is due to the emergence of anti - gravity between them .",
    "in fact , in m - theory , at the first , there are only scalar fields that are attached to m0-branes .",
    "then , by joining m0-branes to each other and the formation of m1-branes , some scalar fields which are attached to them transit to gauge fields . also , by breaking the symmetry of m1-branes such as the upper and lower parts of m1-branes are not the same , gauge fields are broken and fermions are produced .",
    "thus , the origin of all three types of matter like scalars , fermions and gauge fields are the same and we can write all interactions in terms of one field only . in a complicated system like graphene , this method makes the consideration and calculations easier respect to the usual field theory that there are three types of indipendent fields .",
    "also , in this method , each free electron interacts with other electrons which some of them are parallel and some are anti - parallel respect to it .",
    "if the curvatures produced by parallel spins are neutralized by the curvatures produced by anti - parallel spins , the applied force to electrons is zero , free electrons move randomly and conductivity decreases . however , if curvatures of anti - parallel spins be more than the curvatures of parallel spins , electrons move in one special direction and conductivity increases . + the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ o1 ] ,",
    "we discuss how , by entering defects , the curvature of non - parallel spins increases and @xmath0 gravity emerges . in section [ o2 ]",
    ", we argue that by changing properties of graphene , the curvature of parallel spins becomes more than curvature of anti - parallel spin and anti-@xmath0 gravity emerges .",
    "this leads to the transmission of electrons in opposite direction respect to expected path .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we design a model which considers the interaction between electrons in a graphene and calculate the curvature produced with different particles in this system . to this end , first we assume that all electrons are paired in the shape of scalars .",
    "then , we break this symmetry and produce gauge fields and in third stage , we break symmetry again and produce fermions .",
    "we will show that the curvature produced by parallel spins is not neutralized by the curvature ( @xmath7 ) produced by non - parallel spins and @xmath0 gravity emerges .",
    "with respect to this point that energy - momentum tensors ( @xmath8 $ ] ) have direct relations with curvatures ( @xmath9 ) , the sum over applied momentum on the electron is not zero and consequently , electrons move in one special path .    in a graphene ,",
    "three electrons of each atom is paired with three electrons of other atom and make spineless pairs .",
    "these pairs can be known as scalars in this system and will be shown by `` x '' in the action .",
    "free electrons are represented by @xmath10 and electrons in each pair are displayed by @xmath11 .",
    "also , gauge fields which are exchanged between electrons are the main cause of gravity between anti - parallel spins and anti - gravity between parallel spins and shown by @xmath12 .",
    "molecules in each graphene are composed of six atoms which are located on the corners of one hexagonal system .",
    "we assume that at the beginning , the graphene is symmetric and all the electrons are paired and at rest and no any gauge field is exchanging between them .",
    "there are many similarities between a graphene and branes . for this reason ,",
    "we use of the model in @xcite for m - theory , to write the relevant action for symmetric state of graphene .",
    "in cosmology , we have shown that at the beginning , in the world , we only have m0-branes which are zero - dimensional objects that scalars are attached to them .",
    "only , after joining these m0-branes to each other and formation of m1-brane , gauge fields and fermions are emerged and symmetry is broken .",
    "then , usual action of mp - branes are produced which include all three types of scalars , gauge fields and fermions @xcite . in this paper , we proposed a model which scalars are pairs of electrons and there is a very high symmetry at first . then symmetry is broken and fermions and gauge fields are produced and shape of this action changes to usual action . using the method in @xcite , we introduce the following action for conducting from each atom in graphene @xcite :    @xmath13,[x^{m},x^{n},x^{l}]\\rangle ) \\label{s1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 , t s are generators of 3-li algebra @xcite and    @xmath15= f^{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma}_{\\eta}t^{\\eta } \\nonumber \\\\&&\\langle t^{\\alpha } , t^{\\beta } \\rangle = h^{\\alpha\\beta } \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ x^{m},x^{n},x^{l}]=[x^{m}_{\\alpha}t^{\\alpha},x^{n}_{\\beta}t^{\\beta},x^{l}_{\\gamma}t^{\\gamma}]\\nonumber \\\\&&\\langle x^{m},x^{m}\\rangle = x^{m}_{\\alpha}x^{m}_{\\beta}\\langle t^{\\alpha } , t^{\\beta } \\rangle \\label{s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath16(m=1,2, ... p ) denote the pairs in graphene , @xmath17 is the metric of system and p is the number of pairs around each carbon . to obtain total action of conductivity in a graphene",

    "branes are compactified , gravity changes to anti - gravity and branes get away from each other . by compacting branes ,",
    "the algebra of system changes and three dimensional brackets in lie - three algebra are replace by two dimensional brackets in lie - two algebra .",
    "two dimensional brackets produce lower number of derivatives respect to three dimensional brackets .",

    "when the angle between sheets of a defect becomes near @xmath113 , parallel spins are placed more closed to each other , respect to anti - parallel spins , gravity changes to anti - gravity and the algebra system transits from lie - three algebra to lie - two algebra with two dimensional brackets . in equation ( [ s24 ] ) , it has been show that by reducing three dimensional brackets to two dimensional brackets , lower number of derivatives are appeared for spinors in expression of ( @xmath46 ) respect to ( [ s9 ] ) and in expression of ( @xmath72 ) respect to ( [ s6 ] and[s8 ] ) .",

    "[ figsr1 ] and [ figsr2 ] , for the same values of the parameters , we see the dependence of the @xmath0-gravity on the number of the defects and on the distance from the wormhole center .",
    "similarly as in fig . [ figsr ] , the dependence on the number of the atoms in all the structure is negligible . furthermore , fig .",
    "[ figsr1 ] shows that the highest value of the @xmath0-gravity could be in the case of 9 defects in the wormhole center .",
    "also , fig.[figsr2 ] shows that by increasing distance from the wormhole center , the effect of defects decreases and @xmath0-gravity decreases and shrinks to zero .    in fig .",
    "[ figssr ] , we see the dependence of the of the conductivity on the size of the wormhole structure ( @xmath138 ) for different values of the mass of the gauge field . it is clear that for bigger wormhole , the curvature of a graphene grows and the conductivity increases .",
    "the equation ( 35 ) also shows that if the angle between sides of a defect is near ( @xmath113 ) , the shape of @xmath0-gravity changes and includes lower orders of curvatures .",
    "this is because that in hexagonal molecule , anti - parallel spins are located at an angle ( @xmath112 ) in neighbor atoms and parallel spins are located at ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "for ( @xmath112 ) , parallel spins become closed to each other and repel each other as due to anti - gravity between them .",
    "also , the effect of anti - parallel spins in curvatures are canceled and the sign of curvature reverses which is a signature of anti - gravity between parallel spins .",
    "the motion of these electrons will be in opposite direction respect to initial path and consequently the path of conductivity reverses .",
    "in this research , we have proposed a new mechanism which considers the evolution of a graphene from a semi - conductor to a superconductor . to this aim ,",
    "first , we design a symmetrical system that all anti - parallel electrons are pair .",
    "then , we break this symmetry and produce free electrons that move along the sheets of graphene .",
    "we show that curvature produced by parallel spins are canceled by curvature produced by anti - parallel spins and total curvature of system is zero .",
    "the curvature has a direct relation with tensor of energy - momentum and thus no momentum is applied to electrons and they move randomly .",
    "we break this symmetry by entering defects to system and show that for special angles , anti - parallel spins become more closed to each other and their curvatures become more stronger than curvatures of parallel spins and an @xmath0 gravity emerges .",
    "this gravity applies a momentum to electrons and lead to their motion in an special path and emergency of superconductivity .",
    "for some other angles between sides of the defects , parallel spins become closed to each other and repel each other . in these conditions ,",
    "a new type of @xmath0 gravity emerges which contains lower orders of curvatures .",
    "also , the couplings of anti - parallel spins in curvatures are removed and the sign of couplings for parallel spins in the curvature reverses which is a signature of anti - gravity between parallel spins . at this stage , electrons move in opposite direction respect to initial path and consequently the path of conductivity reverses .    the motion of the electrons is also influenced by other factors @xcite : the differences in fermi level at different distances from the center of a graphene wormhole , the electron mass acquisition due to relativistic effects connected with the effect of antigravity and high velocity of the electrons close to wormhole center and the properties of the connecting nanotube as an individual graphitic nonstructural .",
    "the first of the mentioned effects causes the creation of the electron flux which is directed to the wormhole center and as the result , the electric charge is accumulated in the wormhole center ( the effect of the so - called `` graphene black hole '' ) .",
    "this property plays a key role in the consideration of the pillared graphene as a material for the storage of the fuels of future ( hydrogen etc . , @xcite ) .",
