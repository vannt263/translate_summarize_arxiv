    "networks of various types , formed by a large number of neurons through synapses , are the substrate of brain functions .",
    "the network structure is the key that determines the responsive behaviors of a network to external inputs , and hence the computations implemented by the neural system .",
    "understanding the relationship between the structure of a neural network and the function it can achieve is at the core of using mathematical models for elucidating brain functions .    in the conventional modeling of neuronal networks , it is often assumed that the connection weights between neurons , which model the efficacy of the activities of pre - synaptic neurons on modulating the states of post - synaptic neurons , are constants , or vary only in long - time scales when learning occurs .",
    "however , experimental data has consistently revealed that neuronal connection weights change in short time scales , varying from hundreds to thousands of milliseconds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is called short - term plasticity ( stp ) .",
    "a predominant type of stp is short - term depression ( std ) , which decreases the connection efficacy when a pre - synaptic neuron fires .",
    "the physiological process underlying std is the depletion of available resources when signals are transmitted from a pre - synaptic neuron to the post - synaptic one .",
    "is std simply a by - product of the biophysical process of neural signaling ?",
    "experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that this is unlikely to be the case . instead , std can play very active roles in neural computation .",
    "for instance , it was found that std can achieve gain control in regulating neural responses to external inputs , realizing weber s law  @xcite .",
    "another example is that std enables a network to generate transient synchronized population firing , appealing for detecting subtle changes in the environment  @xcite .",
    "the std of a neuron is also thought to play a role in estimating the information of the pre - synaptic membrane potential from the spikes it receives @xcite . from the computational point of view",
    ", the time scale of std resides between fast neural signaling ( in the order of milliseconds ) and slow learning ( in the order of minutes or above ) , which is the time order of many important temporal operations occurring in our daily life , such as working memory .",
    "thus , std may serve as a substrate for neural systems to manipulate temporal information in the relevant time scales .    in this study",
    ", we will further explore the potential role of std in neural information processing , an issue of fundamental importance but has not been adequately investigated so far .",
    "we will use continuous attractor neural networks ( canns ) as working models .",
    "canns are a type of recurrent networks which hold a continuous family of localized active states  @xcite .",
    "neutral stability is a key advantage of canns , which enables neural systems to update memory states or to track time - varying stimuli smoothly .",
    "canns have been successfully applied to describe the retaining of short - term memory , and the encoding of continuous features , such as the orientation , the head direction and the spatial location of objects , in neural systems  @xcite .",
    "canns are also shown to provide a framework for implementing population decoding efficiently  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the dynamics of a cann with std included , and find that apart from the static bump states , the network can also hold moving bump solutions .",
    "this finding agrees with the results reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that with std , the network can have slow - decaying plateau states , that is , the network being stimulated to an active state by a transient input will decay to silence very slowly in the time order of std rather than that of neural signaling .",
    "this is a very interesting property .",
    "it implies that std can provide a mechanism for neural systems to generate short - term memory and shut off activities naturally .",
    "we also find that std retains the neutral stability of the cann , and enhances the tracking performance of the network to external inputs .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional continuous stimulus @xmath0 encoded by an ensemble of neurons .",
    "for example , the stimulus may represent the moving direction , the orientation or a general continuous feature of objects extracted by the neural system .",
    "let @xmath1 be the synaptic input at time @xmath2 to the neurons whose preferred stimulus is @xmath0 .",
    "the range of the possible values of the stimulus is @xmath3 and @xmath1 is periodic , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics is particularly convenient to analyze in the limit that the interaction range @xmath5 is much less than the stimulus range @xmath6 , so that we can effectively take @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath1 is determined by the external input @xmath8 , the network input from other neurons , and its own relaxation .",
    "it is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the synaptical transmission delay , which is typically in the order of 2 to 5 ms .",
    "@xmath11 is the base neural interaction from @xmath12 to @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath13 is the firing rate of neurons .",
    "it increases with the synaptic input , but saturates in the presence of a global activity - dependent inhibition . a solvable model that captures these features is given by @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the neural density , and @xmath16 is a positive constant controlling the strength of global inhibition .",
    "the global inhibition can be generated by shunting inhibition  @xcite .",
    "the key character of canns is the translational invariance of their neural interactions . in our solvable model",
    ", we choose gaussian interactions with a range @xmath5 , namely , @xmath17/(a\\sqrt{2\\pi})$ ] , where @xmath18 is a constant .",

    "its dynamics is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time constant for synaptic depression , and the parameter @xmath22 controls the depression effect due to neural firing .",
    "the network dynamics is governed by two time scales .",
    "the time constants of std is typically in the range of hundreds to thousands of milliseconds , much larger than that of neural signaling , i.e. , @xmath23 .",

    "these stationary states are translationally invariant among themselves and have the gaussian shape with a free parameter @xmath31 representing the position of the gaussian bumps .",
    "they exist for @xmath32 , @xmath33 is thus the critical inhibition strength .",
    "fung et al @xcite considered the perturbations of the gaussian states .",
    "they found various distortion modes , each characterized by an eigenvalue representing its rate of evolution in time .",
    "a key property they found is that the translational mode has a zero eigenvalue , and all other distortion modes have negative eigenvalues for @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that the gaussian bumps are able to track changes in the position of the external stimuli by continuously shifting the position of the bumps , with other distortion modes affecting the tracking process only in the transients .",
    "an example of the tracking process is shown in figs . 1 and 2 , when an external stimulus with a gaussian profile is initially centered at @xmath35 , pinning the center of a gaussian neuronal response at the same position .",
    "at time @xmath36 , the stimulus shifts its center from @xmath35 to @xmath37 abruptly .",
    "the bump moves towards the new stimulus position , and catches up with the stimulus change after a time duration . which is referred to as the reaction time .",
    "for clarity , we will first summarize the main results obtained on the network dynamics due to std , and then present the theoretical analysis in sec .  4 .      in the presence of std , canns exhibit new interesting dynamical behaviors .",
    "apart from the static bump state , the network also supports moving bump states . to construct a phase diagram mapping these behaviors ,",

    "this can be seen from the steady state solution of @xmath1 , which reads @xmath48 the third term in the denominator of the integrand arises from std , and plays the role of a local inhibition that is strongest where the neurons are most active . hence we see that the silent state with @xmath49 is the only stable state when either @xmath50 or @xmath51 is large .",
    "when std is weak , the network behaves similarly with canns without std , that is , the static bump state is present up to @xmath50 near 1 .",
    "however , when @xmath51 increases , a state with the bump spontaneously moving at a constant velocity comes into existence .",
    "such moving states have been predicted in canns @xcite , and can be associated with traveling wave behaviors widely observed in the neocortex  @xcite . at an intermediate range of @xmath51 ,",

    "although the bump is stable against symmetric fluctuations , asymmetric fluctuations can displace its position and eventually convert it to a moving bump .      as shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , the profile of a moving bump is characterized by a lag of the synaptic depression behind the moving bump .",

    "the most interesting family of trajectories is represented by b and c in fig .",

    "nevertheless , they converge rapidly , in a time of order @xmath86 , to the band @xmath88 , where the dynamics of @xmath63 is slow .",

    "this happens when the initial condition of the network lies outside the basin of attraction of the static states , but it is still in the vicinity of the basin boundary .    when one goes deeper into the silent phase , the region of slow dynamics between the @xmath63- and @xmath90-nullclines broadens .",
    "hence plateau lifetimes are longest near the phase boundary between the bump and silent states , and become shorter when one goes deeper into the silent phase .",
    "this is confirmed by the contours of plateau lifetimes in the phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "this is due to the metastatic behavior of the bumps , which enhances their reaction to move from the static state when a small push is exerted .",

    "5 , the quantitative agreement is much more satisfactory .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the impact of std on the dynamics of a cann , and found that the network can support both static and moving bumps .",
    "static bumps exist only when the synaptic depression is sufficiently weak .",
    "a consequence of synaptic depression is that it places static bumps in the metastatic state , so that its response to changing stimuli is speeded up , enhancing its tracking performance .",
    "we conjecture that moving bump states may be associated with traveling wave behaviors widely observed in the neurocortex .",
    "a finding in our work with possibly very important biological implications is that std endows the network with slow - decaying behaviors . when the network is initially stimulated to an active state by an external input",
    ", it will decay to silence very slowly after the input is removed .",
    "the duration of the plateau is of the time scale of std rather than neural signaling , and it provides a way for the network to hold the stimulus information for up to hundreds of milliseconds , if the network operates in the parameter regime that the bumps are marginally unstable .",
    "this property is , on the other hand , extremely difficult to be implemented in attractor networks without std . in a cann without std , an active state of the network",
    "decays to silence exponentially fast or persists forever , depending on the initial activity level of the network .",
    "indeed , how to shut off the activity of a cann has been a challenging issue that received wide attention in theoretical neuroscience , with solutions suggesting that a strong external input either in the form of inhibition or excitation must be applied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here , we show that std provides a mechanism for closing down network activities naturally and in the desirable duration .",
    "we have also analyzed the dynamics of canns with std using a gaussian approximation of the bump .",
    "it describes the phase diagram of the static and moving phases , the plateau behavior , and provides insights on the metastatic nature of the bumps and its relation with the enhanced tracking performance . in most cases , approximating @xmath40 by a gaussian profile",
    "is already sufficient to produce qualitatively satisfactory results .",
    "however , higher order perturbation analysis is required to yield more accurate descriptions of results such as the overshooting in the tracking process ( fig .",
    "besides std , there are other forms of stp that may be relevant to realizing short - term memory .",
    "mongillo et al .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a very interesting idea for achieving working memory in the prefrontal cortex by utilizing the effect of short - term facilitation ( stf ) .",
    "compared with std , stf has the opposite effect in modifying the neuronal connection weights .",
    "the underlying biophysics of stf is the increased level of residual calcium due to neural firing , which increases the releasing probability of neural transmitters .",
    "mongillo et al .",
    "@xcite showed that stf provides a way for the network to encode the information of external inputs in the facilitated connection weights , and it has the advantage of not having to recruit persistent neural firing and hence is economically efficient .",
    "this stf - based memory mechanism is , however , not necessarily contradictory to the std - based one we propose here",
    ". they may be present in different cortical areas for different computational purposes .",
    "std and stf have been observed to have different effects in different cortical areas .",
    "one location is the sensory cortex where cann models are often applicable . here",
    ", the effects of std tends to be stronger than that of stf .",
    "different from the stf - based mechanism , our work suggests that the std - based one exhibits the prolonged neural firing , which has been observed in some cortical areas . in terms of information transmission ,",
    "prolonged neural firing is preferable in the early information pathways , so that the stimulus information can be conveyed to higher cortical areas through neuronal interactions .",
    "hence , it seems that the brain may use a strategy of weighting the effects of std and stf differentially for carrying out different computational tasks .",
    "it is our goal in future work to explore the joint impact of std and stf on the dynamics of neuronal networks ."
