    "it is widely accepted that progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are mass accreting c - o white dwarfs , although the nature of the progenitor binary systems is still under debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . to find a path to sne ia is to find a way for a c - o white dwarf to increase its central density and temperature to carbon ignition as the chandrasekhar limit",
    "is approached .",
    "if the mass donor is a normal star , the stability of the hydrogen burning shell in the accreting white dwarf is crucial for its evolution .",
    "a hydrogen - shell burning is ignited in an accreting white dwarf when a certain amount of hydrogen - rich matter is accumulated in the envelope .",
    "the shell burning is unstable to flash if the accretion rate is lower than a critical rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the flash is stronger if the white dwarf is cooler and the accretion is slower @xcite .",
    "if the shell flash is strong enough to trigger a nova outburst , most part of the envelope would be lost from the system . moreover ,",
    "a part of the original white dwarf matter could be dredged up and lost in the outburst wind .",
    "therefore , the white dwarf mass could decrease after one cycle of nova outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite did not find such indication in the nova systems .",
    "if the accretion rate @xmath3 is high enough , on the other hand , the shell burning is stable and the mass of the white dwarf increases with accretion .",
    "thus , the critical accretion rate @xmath4 , above which hydrogen shell burning is stable , is an important physical value for the evolution of accreting white dwarfs .",
    "( for @xmath3 being appreciably higher than @xmath4 , see  5 ) .",
    "studies on the thermal instability of a thin nuclear - burning shell began when @xcite found that helium shell flashes were caused by a thermal instability of a shell around a c - o core of an evolved star .",
    "since then , the stability of a nuclear shell burning in an accreting white dwarf has been extensively studied in connection with nova outbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite obtained the stability boundary by examining thermal stability of steady - state models for accreting white dwarfs of various masses .",
    "the stability boundary , which is @xmath5yr@xmath1 at @xmath6 and higher for more massive white dwarfs , is consistent with fully time - dependent calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite published new models of accreting white dwarfs called `` surface hydrogen burning '' models .",
    "they tried to show that if a very hot white dwarf after a nova outburst started accreting hydrogen - rich matter , it developed surface hydrogen burning that stably converts hydrogen into helium and helium into heavier elements ; then the white dwarf mass could grow to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "they obtained such `` surface hydrogen burning '' models for accretion rates ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8  yr@xmath1 , and identified these models as supersoft x - ray sources .",
    "the properties of their models , however , clearly contradict previous results of evolutionary and steady - state models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    we will show in this paper that the contrasting properties of the `` surface hydrogen burning '' models result from too coarse zoning for the envelope structure .",
    "we first re - calculate steady - state models for various accretion rates and white dwarf masses .",
    "if accretion continues long enough , the mean luminosity of the white dwarf should approach the steady - state luminosity irrespective of the initial luminosity .",
    "we then examine the thermal stability of these models to confirm the results of @xcite using the updated input physics .    in obtaining our steady models , we solve the full stellar structure in order to avoid the approximations made in the one zone models @xcite .",
    "we present more detailed numerical models , their stabilities , and the exact stability boundary values in tabular forms and formula for a wider range of the white dwarf mass and the accretion rate compared with @xcite .",
    "we have adopted linear stability analysis mainly because we can avoid long evolution calculations for many models . in oder to judge the stability by evolution calculations as in @xcite , we have to adopt sufficiently short time steps , which demands long cpu times .",
    "also , by a linear analysis we can determine the stability boundary exactly , while it is difficult for the evolutionary calculations , because near the stability boundary the growth time is so long that it would be difficult to distinguish the variation due to thermal instability from a normal evolutionary change .",
    "then we examine the `` surface hydrogen burning '' models by @xcite and discuss the reason for the discrepancy with the previous results .",
    "our numerical methods are described in  2 and our results are given in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the reason for the discrepancy between starrfield et al.s ( 2004 ) models and the previous results , and compare the loci on the hr diagram of our steady - state models to those of luminous supersoft x - ray sources .",
    "implications on the progenitors of type ia supernovae are discussed in  5 .",
    "we have constructed steady - state models for white dwarfs accreting matter of solar composition .",
    "the steady - state model consists of a c - o core surrounded by a hydrogen - rich envelope of the solar abundances . at the bottom of the envelope ,",
    "hydrogen is burned at the same rate as the star accretes it ; i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the luminosity due to hydrogen burning , @xmath11 is the hydrogen mass fraction in the accreted matter , @xmath12erg g@xmath1 energy generated when 1 gram of hydrogen is converted to helium , and @xmath3 is the mass accretion rate .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates are taken from @xcite with the weak and intermediate screening factors by @xcite .",
    "the helium layer and helium shell burning are neglected for simplicity , because the stability of hydrogen burning in a thin shell is mainly determined by the structure of hydrogen - rich layer above the hydrogen burning - shell @xcite .",
    "also the helium layer is thin and the energy release is only 10 % of hydrogen burning so that the effects on the stability of hydrogen burning shell are negligible ( see @xcite for the study of the effect of heat flux from the core ) . the compressional heating due to accretion is included in the same way as in @xcite ; i.e. , the heating rate per unit mass , @xmath13 , is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the entropy per unit mass , and @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the mass included in the sphere of radius @xmath18 .",

    "table 1 compares the two white dwarf models with @xmath110 accreting hydrogen - rich matter at a rate of @xmath113  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the steady - state model calculated in the present study has @xmath114 and @xmath115(k ) = 7.98 ( 4th column ) . for the model with the asterisk ( 7th column ) , the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope is artificially set to be @xmath116 , which is the same as the `` surface zone mass '' adopted by @xcite . according to equation ( [ pressure_q ] ) and @xmath117 , the temperature at the burning shell ( @xmath115(k ) = 8.41 ) is much higher than those of the steady - state model .    such a high temperature is comparable to that of the surface zone of @xcite , from which we see the reason why @xcite obtain very high temperature at the `` surface zone '' .",
    "they treated the envelope between the region of @xmath118 by a single mass zone , while our steady - state models resolve the h - rich envelope with @xmath119 mass zones .",
    "obviously , the zoning adopted by @xcite is too coarse to obtain a physically realistic stellar model .    in the heavy envelope model ,",
    "the temperature at the hydrogen burning shell is so high that all accreted hydrogen burns in one typical time step to compute mass accretion , as @xcite states `` it takes less time than the time step ( @xmath120 s ) for all the infalling hydrogen to burn to helium in this zone '' . in this case ,",
    "the nuclear energy generation rate @xmath27 is determined not by the temperature - dependent nuclear reaction rate but by the supplying rate of nuclear fuel as @xmath121    despite such a high temperature as @xmath122(k ) = 8.41 , the energy generation rate thus determined is @xmath123 ergs g@xmath1 s@xmath1 , which is much lower than the @xmath124limited reaction rate of the hot cno cycle @xmath125 ergs g@xmath1 s@xmath1 . because @xmath126 is constant , being independent of the temperature , the nuclear burning is stable ; it is also steady as expressed by equation ( 1 ) . in other words ,",
    "the assumed envelope mass @xmath90 is too large and hence the temperature at the nuclear burning shell is too high for the mass accretion rates they assumed .",
    "all the accreted hydrogen - rich matter should have been consumed long before it is pushed into a layer as deep as @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "supersoft x - ray sources are suggested to be accreting white dwarfs in which steady hydrogen burning is taking place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued that the properties of their `` surface hydrogen burning '' models agree with some of supersoft x - ray sources . in this subsection , therefore , we compare our steady burning models and the `` surface hydrogen burning '' models in the hr diagram with several observed supersoft x - ray sources .    in the hr diagram of figure  [ hrd2 ] , we show the loci of the steady burning models for given @xmath21 .",
    "the filled small circles on the solid lines indicate the thermally stable models in figure  [ hrd ] , while the dotted lines correspond to the unstable solutions . for comparison , the `` surface hydrogen burning ''",
    "models with @xmath110 @xcite are shown by the crosses .",
    "in contrast to the `` surface hydrogen burning '' models , the sequences of stable models shown by the solid lines bends rightward because of the increasing radius with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the large boxes in figure  [ hrd2 ] indicate the positions of several supersoft x - ray sources taken from @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of supersoft x - ray sources are very uncertain because very soft x - rays are easily absorbed by neutral hydrogen .",
    "for example , although the luminosity of cal 87 in lmc is lower than the @xmath128 white dwarf sequence in figure [ hrd2 ] , the bolometric luminosity of cal 87 has been estimated to be a few times @xmath129ergs s@xmath1 , far above the error box @xcite .",
    "taking into account such large uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity , we may consider that the loci of luminous supersoft x - ray sources in the hr diagram are not inconsistent with the loci of thermally stable models ( solid line parts ) .",
    "we suggest that no supersoft x - ray source is expected in the dashed line region , because optically thick winds are predicted to blow in this region @xcite and the matter in the winds would absorb most of the supersoft x - rays .",
    "we have added one more supersoft x - ray source in the lmc , rx  j0513.9@xmath1306951 .",
    "@xcite estimated the surface temperature @xmath131  ev and the total luminosity @xmath132  ergs  s@xmath1 by a black - body fitting . on the other hand , @xcite obtained @xmath133  ergs  s@xmath1 by their model atmosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "this is a quasi - regular transient x - ray source with a relatively short x - ray - on ( @xmath134  days ) and a long x - ray - off ( @xmath135  days ) states .",
    "@xcite proposed a transition model , in which the white dwarf expands or contracts intermittently . in this model",
    ", an optically thick wind occurs only when the star is expanded , and the x - ray - off state is interpreted as this expanded phase where the supersoft x - rays are absorbed by the wind materials .",
    "the existence of such a transient supersoft x - ray source as shown in figure  [ hrd2 ] may support our results that there exist envelope expansions for high mass accretion rates .",
    "note that in starrfield et al.s models the envelopes do not expand even for higher mass accretion rates .",
    "this transient x - ray phenomenon is common at least in the lmc and our galaxy , because such a system exists not only in the lmc ( in a lower metallicity environment ) but also in our galaxy . a galactic supersoft x - ray source ,",
    "v sge , which is not shown in figure  [ hrd2 ] , is a sister system to rx  j 0513.9 - 6951 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above comparison shows that the properties of luminous supersoft x - ray sources are consistent with our steady hydrogen - burning white dwarf models .",
    "we have reinvestigated the properties of accreting white dwarfs by constructing steady - state models , in which hydrogen shell burning consumes hydrogen at the same rate as the white dwarf accretes it .",
    "we have confirmed that these steady models are stable only when the accretion rate is higher than @xmath4 in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "our results contradict the `` surface hydrogen burning '' models by @xcite who found quiescent stable hydrogen burning for a wide range of accretion rates down to @xmath136 yr@xmath1 .",
    "we believe we have shown that quiescence of `` surface hydrogen burning '' results from the too large zone mass ( @xmath137 ) in the outer part of the numerical models , and that hydrogen burning must occur in a much more superficial layer ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "we have shown that the positions on the hr diagram of most of the luminous supersoft x - ray sources are consistent with the white dwarfs accreting matter at rates high enough for hydrogen shell burning to be thermally stable .    the narrow range of the accretion rate that leads to the steady and stable hydrogen burning has been confirmed . despite that property , how the progenitor white dwarfs for",
