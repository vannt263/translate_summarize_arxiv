    "ptfo 8 - 8695 is a pre - main - sequence star ( weak - line t - tauri star ) located in the orion ob1a star forming region , first discovered by @xcite .",
    "subsequent photometric transit and spectroscopic radial velocity measurements revealed that ptfo 8 - 8695 harbors one close - in planet ( ptfo 8 - 8695 b ) with planetary mass @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is the first transiting exoplanet candidate around a pre - main - sequence star .",
    "@xcite discovered that ptfo 8 - 8695 in 2009 and 2010 exhibited very different transit lightcurves .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , b13 ) found that the peculiar time - variation can be explained by the gravity darkening of the central star and the spin - orbit nodal precession of the system .",
    "indeed they are successful in fitting simultaneously the lightcurves in 2009 and 2010 , and estimated the system parameters including stellar and planetary radii ( @xmath6 ) , planetary mass ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) , and spin - orbit angle ( @xmath9 ; the angle between stellar spin and planetary orbital axes ) .    in doing so",
    ", they assumed that the stellar spin and planetary orbital motion are synchronised for simplicity .",
    "given the large spin - orbit misalignment estimated for the ptfo 8 - 8695 system , however , the synchronous assumption may not be justified from the dynamical point - of - view .",
    "therefore we reanalyse the ptfo 8 - 8695 transit photometry without adopting the spin - orbit synchronous assumption .",
    "as expected , the permitted parameter space is increased , and we discuss a feasibility to break the degeneracy among different solutions with future observations .    the rest of the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarizes the previous work on the ptfo 8 - 8695 system .",
    "we adopt a model of gravity darkening and spin - orbit nodal precession of b13 , which is described in section 3 .",
    "our data analysis and parameter fitting procedures are presented in  4.1 and 4.2 , respectively , and the resulting constraint on the system parameters from 2009 and 2010 data is shown in  4.3 .",
    "we also discuss how the long - term photometric monitoring of the system is useful in further constraining the parameter space .",
    "a preliminary analysis with the observation performed in 2014 - 2015 at koyama astronomical observatory ( kao ) is presented in  4.4 .",
    "we discuss the long - term dynamical stability of the system in section 5 .",
    "final section is devoted to the summary of the paper and the further discussion .",
    "the transits of ptfo 8 - 8695 b were observed at palomar observatory for 2009 december 1 - 2010 january 15 ( hereafter , referred to as 2009 observation ) , and 2010 december 8 - 17 ( 2010 observation ) as part of the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) that ran for 2009 - 2012 .",
    "the 2009 and 2010 observations comprise 11 and 6 reliable transit lightcurves , respectively , with the transit period of 0.448413 days @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in introduction , the lightcurves exhibit a significant time variation , and b13 solved this puzzle by taking into account both the rapid rotation of the star and short transit period of the planet .",
    "spectroscopic measurement of ptfo 8 - 8695 implies that the host star is a rapid rotator with the spin period of @xmath10 0.671 days @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observational evidence that t - tauri stars ( especially , weak - line t - tauri stars like ptfo 8 - 8695 ) tend to rotate more rapidly than main sequence stars @xcite . because of the rapid rotation , the equator of ptfo 8 - 8695 would be significantly expanded relative to its polar radius .    because of the stellar surface distortion , ptfo 8 - 8695 should exhibit significant @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the nodal precession of stellar spin and planetary orbital axes .",
    "b13 took account of both effects properly , and are successful in reproducing both 2009 and 2010 lightcurves either for two different stellar masses , @xmath12 = 0.34 and 0.44 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the nodal precession period depends sensitively on both the stellar spin and planetary orbital periods , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "while the latter is well - determined from the transit period ( @xmath14 days ) , only the upper limit is obtained observationally for the former , @xmath15 0.671 days .",
    "since @xcite concluded that the stellar spin and planetary orbital motion are most likely synchronized ( @xmath16 ) , b13 adopted that assumption for simplicity throughout their analysis .    theoretically speaking , however , the validity of this assumption is not clear .",
    "one of the most probable mechanisms for the spin - orbit synchronization is the tidal effect between the star and planet . in this case , the spin - orbit synchronization and the spin - orbit alignment occur simultaneously .",
    "the equilibrium tidal model , for instance , predicts that the effective timescales for the two processes are almost the same ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless the result of b13 indicates the significant spin - orbit misalignment ( @xmath9 ) , and indeed they admitted that the truly synchronous rotation might be difficult to be achieved under such a misaligned state .",
    "this is why we attempt in the present paper to reanalyse the ptfo 8 - 8695 system , to see how the estimated parameters are sensitive to the synchronous condition .",
    "this section summarizes the basic equations that we use in the later analysis , largely following b13 .",
    "our model employs 16 parameters in total , and for clarity we list them in table [ parameters ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + note . - our angular parameters ( @xmath17 ) are evaluated at @xmath18=2455543.9402 hjd while those of b13 are at @xmath18=2455536.7680 hjd , whose interval corresponds to 7.1722 days or 16 transits .",
    "spin - orbit angle @xmath19 is time - invariant .",
    "[ solutions ]    the reason why we have three different solutions can be understood from figure [ lc ] , which plots the predicted lightcurves for the three solutions ; the short , middle , and long solutions are plotted as red , green , and blue lines , respectively . because the transit period is very short , the lightcurves in the lower panel basically show the evolution of the transit @xmath20 for three solutions .",
    "the five vertical lines in the lower panel are drawn at three - month intervals , each corresponding to the enlarged graph at the upper panels . by construction ,",
    "all the three solutions reproduce the 2009 and 2010 data very well ( upper - left and upper - right panels ) , and the significant difference of the lightcurves shows up only during the unobserved epochs .",
    "the examples plotted in the three upper - middle panels illustrate the importance of frequent monitoring of the system in order to specify the system parameters precisely .",
    "indeed some phases without any transit signals are predicted during their whole evolution because planetary orbital inclination significantly deviates from @xmath21 .",
    "thus measurements of the transit depth , even with a relatively low signal - to - noise ratio , greatly help distinguishing among the three solution groups .     +      in this subsection , we attempt a preliminary comparison with the transit photometry taken with araki telescope at koyama astronomical observatory ( kao ) on 2014 november 23 , 27 , december 2 , 23 , and 2015 january 10",
    ". the photometry has been performed by a dual - band imager , adler ( araki telescope dual - band imager , @xmath22 pixels and 12 @xmath23 fov for each ccd camera ) . the observation was performed with a 670 nm - split dichroic mirror , and the sdss g@xmath24- and i@xmath24-band filters . the exposure time is set to 180 s , and 2 exposures are stacked .",
    "the observational data are reduced with standard procedures for photometry , i.e. , dark - subtraction , flat - fielding , and aperture photometry ( daophot task in iraf ) . for relative photometry",
    ", we adopt a star located at ( ra , dec ) = ( 05:25:07.89 , + 01:31:16.1 ) as a reference star .",
    "we also compared the results with other reference stars , and confirmed that the lightcurve did not change significantly , less than @xmath25 .",
    "since g@xmath24-band data do not have enough signal for the current purpose , we only focus on i@xmath24-band data in this paper .",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ lc_kao ] shows the predicted evolution of transit depth for the three solutions over the observed epoch .",
    "the five vertical black lines indicate the above five days , whose enlarged views are shown in the upper panel .",
    "the predicted transit depths at those dates are less than 1@xmath26 for the short solution and greater than approximately 10% for the middle and long solutions .",
    "the filled circles , on the other hand , indicate the data points after removing the long - term stellar activity . since there are",
    "no clear transit signals beyond the photometric noise level of a few percents , the data seem to prefer the short solution .",
    "although this conclusion is admittedly very premature , it clearly indicates that such fairly crude photometry may be very useful in distinguishing among the three solutions .",
    "we plan to conduct the photometric observations again during winter in 2015 and 2016 .",
    "the results and discussion so far are all focused on the short - term dynamics of the system ; the nodal precession whose expected time scale is several hundred days .",
    "in addition to such a short - term behavior , long - term dynamics also contributes to getting an insight into the nature of the pre - main - sequence star and close - in planet system .",
    "when pursuing the longer - term evolution , tidal effect between the star and close - in planet should be considered . in the ptfo 8 - 8695 system ,",
    "particularly , the star and planet are expected to be strongly influenced by the tidal effects because the planetary semi - major axis is very small ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we investigate the long - term stability of this system following the equilibrium tidal model by @xcite .",
    "note here that the two new parameters show up to describe the efficiency of the tidal effect ; love number @xmath28 and tidal delay time @xmath29 , both of which refer to the fluid property of the central star .",
    "tidal evolution of the system is computed by numerical integration of equations ( 19 ) - ( 21 ) in @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of tidal effect is also represented by the reduced tidal quality factor @xmath30 , which is written in terms of the above parameters as @xmath31 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt our short solution as initial conditions and the values of love number and tidal delay time estimated for sun - like stars ( @xmath28 = 0.028 and @xmath29 = 0.1 s following @xcite , which gives @xmath32 for an orbital period of 0.448413 days ) .",
    "the upper , middle , and lower panels of figure [ tides ] show the resulting evolution of planetary semi - major axis , spin - orbit angle , and stellar spin and planetary orbital periods , respectively . among them , it is worth noting that tidal effect leads to the planetary orbital decay ( @xmath33 ) with the time scale less than @xmath34 yrs ( upper panel ) .",
    "this time scale is smaller than the age of ptfo 8 - 8695 system ( 2.6 - 2.7 myrs ) by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "( middle ) , and stellar rotational and planetary orbital period ( bottom ) . in the upper panel , stellar inside ( @xmath35 ) is described . in the lower panel ,",
    "stellar rotational and planetary orbital periods are shown as red and blue lines , respectively .",
    "this calculation employs the love number of @xmath36 and tidal delay time of @xmath37 s , both of which are estimated for sun - like stars.,width=332 ]    this rapid orbital decay is totally inconsistent with the observational picture that favors the survival of a close - in planet in the ptfo 8 - 8695 system .",
    "in addition , both spin - orbit angle @xmath19 and orbital period @xmath0 evolve quickly in accordance with the rapid orbital decay ( middle panel and blue line in lower panel ) , which is also incompatible with the significant spin - orbit misalignment or spin - orbit near synchronization obtained by the lightcurve analysis .",
    "since @xmath36 and @xmath37 s are estimated for sun - like stars , these issues suggest that the internal structure or fluid property of ptfo 8 - 8695 is significantly different from those of the main - sequence stars .",
    "reasonable constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath29 of ptfo 8 - 8695 , therefore , allow us to approach the internal structure and fluid properties of pre - main - sequence stars , which are poorly known today due to the scarcity of the observed samples .",
    "the spin - orbit angle @xmath19 plays a key role in investigating the formation mechanism of hot jupiters ( e.g. , and references therein ) , and then various methods to determine the angular configuration of the planetary system are developed and utilized .",
    "the most popular one is to use the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which reveals the sky - projected spin - orbit angle through spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . by combining the rm effect and asteroseismology ,",
    "furthermore , three - dimensional spin - orbit angle @xmath19 can be determined ( , @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar gravity - darkening effect provides another methodology to measure @xmath19 through the analysis of photometric transit lightuchrves for rapid rotators ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "advantages of this method are that one can determine three - dimensional ( i.e. , not projected ) spin - orbit angle directly and that the analysis is possible without the spectroscopical data ( i.e. , all we need is the photometric transit lightcurves ) . when nodal precession occurs , furthermore , more precise constraints on the system are obtained ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "being a rapid rotator , ptfo 8 - 8695 is therefore an ideal sample to check the model of gravity darkening and nodal precession .",
    "we reanalyse the time - variable transit lightcurves of this planetary system with the above theoretical model , discarding the spin - orbit synchronous condition assumed in the previous analysis , @xcite .",
    "we find three different groups of solutions that reproduce the observed data , whose precession periods are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 days .",
    "these solutions are slightly better , or at least equally good compared to those in the previous work .",
    "the three solutions reproduce 2009 and 2010 observational photometry very well , whereas the theoretically - predicted transit lightcurves at unobserved epochs are found to be totally different .",
    "difference in transit depth is particularly useful to distinguish among them with the frequent monitoring of the system .",
    "we also present a preliminary comparison of the lightcurve prediction with the additional photometry taken with araki telescope at koyama astronomical observatory , and find that the solution with the precession period of @xmath2 days seems to be preferred .",
    "the solution implies @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "although this result is still preliminary , more precise constraints on the system configuration are expected to result from our continuous photometric observations during winter in 2015 and 2016 .",
    "the long - term analysis taking into account the tidal effect between star and planet in the ptfo 8 - 8695 system suggests that tidal parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 for pre - main - sequence stars are incompatible with those for main - sequence stars ; otherwise , the orbiting planet is engulfed by the central star on the very short time scale .",
    "this fact implies that the internal structure of young stars is likely to be different from that for matured stars , and requires further investigation .",
    "indeed , gravity darkening becomes more manifesting as the star rotates more rapidly .",
    "this is in contrast to the rm effect , which becomes harder to measure in the rapid rotators .",
    "therefore gravity darkening provides a complementary methodology to the rm effect in the measurement of @xmath19 .",
    "since younger stars are known to rotate more rapidly than those matured , gravity darkening is available to unveil the distribution of @xmath19 for the younger systems by the future observations .",
    "although tidal evolution of @xmath19 causes the initial memory on the formation process of hot jupiters to be lost ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , one can minimize this undesirable effect by preferentially selecting younger systems as targets to measure @xmath19 .",
    "these aspects suggest that gravity - darkening ( combined with nodal precession , if possible ) model is very useful to study the formation scenario of close - in planets .",
