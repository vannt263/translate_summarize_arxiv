    "all - optical networks hold the promise of fast transmission speed and ultra - high data capacity owing to the non - interacting nature and large bandwidth of photonic signals .",
    "a necessary resource for such networks is all - optical switching , in which the state of a signal wave is switched in the presence of a control wave ( pump ) .",
    "this is routinely achieved using direct coupling between the two waves in nonlinear materials , such as semiconductors @xcite , @xmath1 fibers @xcite , and cascaded @xmath0 waveguides @xcite .",
    "a fundamental limit in these devices is due to the photon loss resulting from signal - pump coupling .",
    "when extended to the quantum domain , this photon loss additionally causes the quantum states of photonic signals to collapse ( i.e. , decohere ) . to overcome",
    "this difficulty , we propose `` interaction - free '' switching that eliminates direct signal - pump coupling .    the concept of `` interaction - free '' phenomenon was first proposed as `` measurement without touching '' @xcite and has recently been extended to quantum logic gates @xcite and counterfactual quantum computation @xcite . in our application to all - optical switching",
    ", we assume the signal wave is initially in state , say , @xmath2 .",
    "if un - disrupted , it will coherently evolve into an orthogonal output state @xmath3 , for example , after passing through a nonlinear waveguide . to induce switching",
    ", we apply a pump wave which couples @xmath3 to an ancillary state @xmath4 .",
    "this coupling provides a source of disruption to the @xmath5 evolution , resulting in the signal being frozen in state @xmath2 .",
    "thus the signal output will be switched between @xmath2 and @xmath3 depending on the presence or absence of the pump .",
    "note that the signal and pump do not directly interact during operation of the device , as ( ideally ) the signal remains in @xmath2 when the pump is on .",
    "therefore , in the ideal case , any photon loss from signal - pump coupling is eliminated .",
    "moreover , the quantum states of both the signal and the pump are protected from decoherence .",
    "each of the above schemes exploits the quantum zeno effect @xcite , whereby unitary evolution is suppressed via quantum decoherence ( i.e. , quantum measurement ) @xcite .",
    "physically , the decoherence can be induced via either incoherent and irreversible coupling to many unknown quantum modes ( e.g. , spontaneous emission into a large number of electromagnetic modes @xcite ) , or coherent and reversible coupling to a known quantum mode ( e.g. , polarization decoherence via a polarization - dependent time delay @xcite ) . in the context of quantum measurement , these two processes are mathematically identical . in the context of interaction - free switching ,",
    "however , we will show that the `` incoherent quantum zeno '' ( iqz ) effect and the `` coherent quantum zeno '' ( cqz ) effect can lead to very different switching performances .",
    "an iqz - based interaction - free switch was recently proposed by jacobs and franson ( hereafter referred to as the `` jf switch '' ) , which is composed of a microring embedded in an atomic vapor @xcite .",
    "we have recently designed another type of cqz - based , interaction - free switch which is based on the coherent dynamical effect of autler - townes splitting @xcite .",
    "the latter switch is composed of a @xmath0 microdisk coupled to two fibers ( or waveguides ) .",
    "a third kind of switch has been demonstrated which relies on the absorption or scattering of pump photons to change the optical properties of resonators @xcite .",
    "although implemented without direct signal - pump coupling , switches of this kind are not lossless and involve significant pump dissipation .",
    "they are thus not considered to be `` interaction - free '' .    in our switch design , both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states",
    "are assumed to be lossless ( a necessary condition for high - fidelity switching ) .",
    "the ancillary state @xmath4 , on the other hand , can be lossy . depending on its lifetime",
    ", the interaction - free disruption will be induced by either the coherent or incoherent quantum zeno effects .",
    "first , if @xmath4 is short lived , then the @xmath6 coupling effectively opens a dissipation channel for @xmath3 .",
    "the inhibition of the @xmath5 transition is therefore a consequence of the iqz effect . in the second case , that of a long - lived @xmath4 sate",
    ", there is no dissipation involved . instead , the latexmath:[$|0\\rangle \\leftrightarrow    effect @xcite , similar to the electromagnetic - induced transparency @xcite .",
    "the former iqz effect corresponds to _ broadening _ of the @xmath3 state , whereas the latter cqz effect corresponds to _ shifting _ of the same state .",
    "the two processes are equally effective for suppressing the @xmath8 transition , but lead to very different pump - power requirements for similar switching setups . to see why , we consider the toy `` @xmath9 '' model described above with rabi frequencies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the @xmath8 and @xmath12 transitions , respectively .",
    "the system evolution time @xmath13 is set to be @xmath14 , such that the signal evolves to @xmath3 with pump off .",
    "the @xmath4 state is assumed to decay at rate @xmath15 .",
    "note that a necessary condition is @xmath16 . in the iqz regime with @xmath17 ,",
    "one finds via adiabatic elimination that the output power fraction of the signal in @xmath3 with pump on is @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , in the cqz regime with @xmath19 , the power fraction in @xmath3 is @xmath20 . as @xmath21 ,",
    "the fraction of the signal evolving into @xmath3 , even with the pump on , is much higher in the iqz regime than in the cqz regime .",
    "this strongly suggests that the cqz effect is more efficient in suppressing the @xmath8 transition , which will lead to better switching performance in the cqz regime .",
    "physically , this is because in the presence of a strong dissipation for @xmath4 , the @xmath22 transition is in fact less disrupted in the iqz regime .    in order to perform a systematic study of the interaction - free switching , in this paper we consider systems composed of @xmath0 waveguides .",
    "two designs are provided .",
    "the first is a traveling - wave design composed of a single - pass waveguide . with no pump ,",
    "the signal undergoes a coherent second - harmonic generation ( shg ) process in the waveguide , resulting in frequency doubling or @xmath23-phase shifting . in this design , the fundamental ( signal input ) and",
    "the second - harmonic ( sh ) wave correspond to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , in the above prototypical model . to induce switching",
    ", a pump wave suppresses the shg by coupling the sh state to an ancillary state ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this coupling can be either sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) or difference - frequency generation ( dfg ) , but for concreteness , in this traveling - wave design we focus on dfg .",
    "using both the iqz and cqz effects , we are able to construct frequency , polarization , and spatial - mode switches . to achieve similar performances , a much stronger pump is required in the iqz regime than in the cqz regime .",
    "all switches turn out to work well for continuous - wave inputs . for the realistic case of non - flat pulses",
    ", however , only the frequency switch is potentially practical .",
    "this is because both the polarization and spatial - mode switches are subject to significant pulse distortion , which fundamentally arises from the nonlinear nature of the shg process .",
    "such distortion would severely limit the cascadability of this type of switches , making them not very useful for potential practical applications .    to overcome pulse distortion",
    ", our second design utilizes a fabry - perot cavity , specifically , a @xmath0 waveguide coated with reflective layers on the two end faces .",
    "the cavity is designed to be resonant for both the signal and pump waves . in the absence of the pump ,",
    "the signal wave , say , applied from the left , is resonantly coupled with the cavity mode .",
    "eventually , it exits from the right end after a time delay . to induce switching",
    ", we apply a pump wave to the cavity , also through the left - end layer . in the cavity ,",
    "the signal and pump waves undergo sfg ( or dfg ) .",
    "the sfg dynamics shifts the cavity out of resonance , resulting in the signal being reflected from the cavity .",
    "note here that the sfg only `` potentially '' happens , as ideally the signal would never enter the cavity .",
    "moreover , by applying the pump pulse slightly ahead of the signal pulse , the pump will pass through the cavity unaffected ( as there is ideally no signal field in the cavity ) .",
    "compared to the traveling - wave design , in this case the quasi - linear cavity - coupling process would overcome pulse distortion , provided that the cavity passband is wider than the fourier spectrum of the pulses .",
    "again , in this design , better switching performance is obtained in the cqz regime than in the iqz regime .",
    "we note that , in the iqz regime , our cavity design is physically equivalent to the jf switch @xcite .",
    "both are implemented via avoided two - photon absorption .",
    "physically , the jf device is composed of a microring evanescently coupled to an atomic vapor .",
    "in contrast , our device utilizes an all solid - state design . in the cqz regime",
    ", the present fabry - perot switch can be mapped onto our recently proposed microdisk switch @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to systematically study the iqz and cqz effects in interaction - free switching by varying the system dissipation .",
    "we present the traveling - wave and fabry - perot designs in sections [ ss ] and [ fpc ] , respectively , before presenting a brief conclusion in section [ dc ] .",
    "in this section we present the traveling - wave design for interaction - free all - optical switching . in section [ ss - setup ]",
    "we describe the schematic setups for three types of devices . in section [ wd ]",
    ", we analytically solve the system dynamics in the cqz and iqz regimes . using these results , in section [ pa ]",
    "we analyze the switching performance for both continuous - wave and pulsed inputs .",
    "the schematic setups for our frequency , polarization , and spatial - mode switching devices are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the frequency switch transforms a signal wave originally at angular frequency @xmath24 into an identical signal at angular frequency @xmath24 or @xmath25 , depending on the presence or absence of the control wave . to achieve this , the waveguide is designed to be phase - matching ( pm ) or quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) for shg of the signal wave .",
    "phase - matching can be achieved in some birefringent crystals by angle tuning @xcite or temperature tuning @xcite , whereas quasi - phase - matching is more flexibly realized in periodically - poled materials whose crystal - axis orientation is periodically inverted along the wave - propagation direction @xcite . in the absence of the control wave , the signal wave undergoes a complete shg cycle as it travels through the waveguide , where its power is monotonically transferred to the harmonic wave ( at angular frequency @xmath25 ) . in the presence of the control wave the shg process",
    "is suppressed , resulting in the majority of the signal power remaining at angular frequency @xmath24 . in effect , the presence of the control wave switches the output signal frequency from @xmath25 to @xmath24 .",
    "analogously , the polarization switch ( see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) performs a polarization rotation ( while leaving the signal frequency unchanged ) that is conditional on the presence or absence of the pump wave .",
    "this type of switch employs phase - mismatched ( pnm ) waveguides to avoid monotonous transfer of power from the signal to the second - harmonic wave . using a uniaxial crystal ,",
    "the waveguide is designed such that one of the two orthogonal signal polarizations experiences a @xmath23 phase shift during the shg process .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by using a periodically - poled ( pp ) uniaxial waveguide in which the ordinary - polarized light is close to qpm , whereas the extraordinary - polarized light is far from phase matching . as above , the presence of the control wave suppresses the shg process and the @xmath23 phase shift associated with it . as an example , consider a waveguide designed such that the polarization state @xmath26 gains an shg - induced @xmath23 phase shift , while the orthogonal polarization state @xmath27 experiences no shg and hence no phase shift .",
    "this waveguide will rotate an input signal whose polarization state is @xmath28 to an output signal with polarization state @xmath29 .",
    "when the pump wave is applied , the shg process is suppressed , leaving the input signal s polarization state @xmath30 unchanged . to implement this switch in isotropic crystals ,",
    "the waveguide must be designed such that both polarizations experience an identical @xmath23-phase shift in the absence of the pump beam .",
    "an input signal @xmath30 will transform to the state @xmath31 , i.e. , unchanged except for a global @xmath23 phase shift .",
    "the switching operation is induced by a vertically - polarized pump of appropriate intensity which suppresses the shg process for vertically - polarized inputs , thus eliminating the shg - induced @xmath23 phase shift .",
    "this type of operation is feasible in type - i @xmath0 crystals because the diagonal nonlinear coefficient @xmath32 is usually much larger than the off - diagonal ones . for a control wave of a particular intensity",
    ", one can strongly disturb the @xmath26-polarized harmonic wave ( up - converted from the @xmath26-polarized signal wave ) , while leaving the @xmath27-polarized harmonic wave nearly undisturbed .",
    "( an analogous design is also possible for biaxial crystals . )    by applying the same type of @xmath23-phase suppression to an input signal in a waveguide inside one arm of an interferometer , we can realize an analogous spatial - mode switching device .",
    "the schematic setup in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows a mach - zehnder interferometer containing a waveguide in the lower arm .",
    "this waveguide is designed such that the shg process induces a @xmath23 phase shift at the signal wavelength . in the absence of a control wave",
    ", the relative phase between the two arms of the interferometer can be adjusted such that a signal wave entering the `` q '' input port of the interferometer will exit from the `` q '' output port of the interferometer . in the presence of the control wave",
    ", the shg process is suppressed along with the associated phase shift . as a result , the signal wave will exit from the `` p '' output port of the interferometer .",
    "this setup can be modified to incorporate two symmetric waveguides with opposite - sign phase - mismatching coefficients , one in each arm of the interferometer , such that  in the absence of the control wave  phase shifts of @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be applied to the signal wave in each arm .",
    "fundamentally , the switches described here rely on second - order nonlinearities to enable the optical control .",
    "more specifically , they rely on the suppression of certain second - order nonlinear optical processes in the presence of a pump wave .",
    "there are two ways to achieve this : sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) and difference - frequency generation ( dfg ) .",
    "when using sfg , the harmonic wave ( with angular frequency @xmath35 ) is coupled to the pump wave ( with angular frequency @xmath36 ) and up - converted into a sum - frequency ( sf ) wave of angular frequency @xmath37 .",
    "when using dfg , the harmonic and pump waves generate a difference - frequency ( df ) wave of angular frequency @xmath38 ( or equivalently , @xmath39 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in both cases , the harmonic level ( following atomic - physics terminology ) will be disturbed and , provided that the coupling is sufficiently strong , the shg process will be suppressed due to either the iqz or the cqz effect .",
    "if the signal wave is in a single - mode of the waveguide , the sf wave will be well guided ; such may not be the case for the df wave , however .",
    "for example , when using a @xmath40-nm signal wave and a @xmath41-nm pump wave , the resulting df wave will be in the terahertz ( thz ) regime . for typical waveguides , such as annealed proton - exchanged waveguides in ppln with a small circumference ( @xmath42100 @xmath43 m ) , such a thz wave will be strongly diffracted , leading to energy dissipation from the system .",
    "this provides a natural dissipation channel for the iqz effect via the purely geometrical effect of _",
    "diffraction_. ( if desired , this diffraction could be overcome by applying reflective coatings to the waveguide side surfaces . )",
    "in contrast , for the sf wave the potential dissipation must rely solely on material absorption . for concreteness , in the following we will focus on the dfg scheme as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . extending to the sfg case",
    "is straightforward .    in all of the optical switches described above",
    ", the pump wave does not directly interact with the signal wave .",
    "this is because the signal s second - harmonic level  the level coupled to the pump wave  never gets populated when under the suppressive influence of the pump .",
    "again , this interaction - free feature eliminates photon loss and protects against decoherence .      to model the system dynamics , we denote the positive - frequency electric fields for the signal , harmonic , pump , and df waves as @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we assume all waves travel in the @xmath46 direction and are linearly @xmath47-polarized .",
    "note whereas only the type - i dynamics are considered here , generalization to the type - ii case is straightforward .",
    "to proceed , we define the following dimensionless variables , @xmath48 with @xmath49 . here",
    ", @xmath50 is the quantization volume , @xmath51 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath52 is the wave - vector magnitude , and @xmath53 is the refractive index . defined as such , the quantity @xmath54 gives the average number of photons inside the volume @xmath50 .",
    "further , we introduce the effective rabi - frequencies in the space domain as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the effective second - order nonlinear coefficient .    in this paper , we assume a matched group velocity @xmath57 for all the waves and neglect any group - velocity dispersion . for switching , we consider a phase - matched dfg process .",
    "these two conditions lead to optimal switching performance .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we assume all waves to be lossless except for the df wave .",
    "the coupled - wave equations in the moving frame @xmath58 are @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the phase - mismatch per unit length and @xmath61 is the decay rate of the df wave .      in the absence of the pump wave , i.e. , @xmath62 , the equations of motion",
    "are reduced to the well - known shg equations @xcite . for our purposes , there are three dynamical regimes of interest : a ) perfect phase - matching with @xmath63 ; b ) small pnm with @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) ; and c ) large pnm with @xmath66 . defining the field amplitude and phase as @xmath67 , for @xmath63 ,",
    "the shg dynamics have an analytical solution @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "thus the system undergoes a monotonous up - conversion process , transferring all power from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "an example of this pm dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .      in the small pnm regime with @xmath73 ,",
    "the signal and pump waves undergo a complete power - conversion process , whereas in the opposite regime of @xmath74 , the majority of power is trapped in the signal wave . in the limit @xmath75",
    ", we have @xmath76 in this case , only a small fraction ( @xmath77 ) of the signal power oscillates between the fundamental and sh levels . as an example , in figs .",

    "the phase dynamics , on the other hand , yield a complicated and nonintuitive expression . nonetheless , for @xmath78 , the periods for the fundamental wave to restore its power while gaining a phase shift of @xmath33 and @xmath23 are approximately @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "in the large pnm limit ( @xmath81 ) , the phase shift increases linearly with @xmath82 , giving @xmath83 this result also shows a linear dependence of the phase shift on the intensity of the signal wave . as we will show later , this intensity - dependence constitutes a major obstacle to applying the present traveling - wave switching scheme to time - varying pulses .",

    "thus , for all switches , a pump wave of power over @xmath147 times greater than the signal wave is required to achieve below @xmath148 loss . in practice , this would fundamentally limit the present switch from being applied in a fan - in / fan - out all - optical network .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome with a fabry - perot design , which we will present later .",
    "the switching contrast , on the other hand , is defined as the power ratio with pump on and off in a certain output channel .",
    "as there are two outputs in our switches , we define the `` flipped '' ( `` unflipped '' ) contrast as the power ratio in the flipped ( unflipped ) output state . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and  ( c ) , the flipped state respectively corresponds to the frequency state @xmath25 , the polarization state @xmath149 , and the output state in the `` q '' port . in each case",
    ", the unflipped state then corresponds to the complementary output .      for cw operation ,",
    "the flipped - state contrast is @xmath150 which increases monotonically with the waveguide length @xmath151 .",
    "this behavior arises from the fact that the shg is a one - way process ( assuming no spontaneous down - conversion ) .",
    "it approaches @xmath152 when @xmath153 .",
    "the unflipped contrast , on the other hand , is given by @xmath154 which monotonically approaches infinity as @xmath155 and all the power is transferred to the sh level .    in the case of pulsed operation with the pump off , the pulse center up - converts more quickly than the pulse tails , due to the nonlinear nature of the shg process .",
    "after the switching , the sh pulse - width is reduced by half compared to the signal . with the pump on ,",
    "the shg - dynamic is equally suppressed across the whole pulse area .",
    "therefore , the switching contrasts with pump off or on are about the same as for cw inputs .",
    "the polarization and spatial - mode switches operate on a similar principle ; in fact , they yield an identical mathematical formulism .",
    "therefore , here we only analyze the spatial - mode switch , noting that all results can be exactly applied to the polarization - mode switch .    in the case of cw inputs and small",
    "pnm ( with @xmath156 ) , we set @xmath157 to necessarily acquire a @xmath23 phase shift as the signal passes through the waveguide .",
    "we note that @xmath79 is insensitive to @xmath115 , but is proportional to @xmath158 ; thus this switch can only function appropriately for signal waves of a certain known intensity .",
    "therefore , it can not be applied to non - flat pulses .",
    "the flipped - state contrast in this case is given by @xmath159 this results in a high switching efficiency .",
    "the unflipped - state contrast , on the other hand , is infinity in the ideal case , as no wave exits from the `` p '' output port with the pump off .    in the case of large pnm with @xmath160 ,",
    "the waveguide length is set to be @xmath161 to achieve a @xmath23 phase shift for the signal wave .",

    "for example , for @xmath163 and a typical @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 .",
    "the unflipped - state switching contrast here is infinity , for the same reason as in the small pnm case .",
    "when non - flat pulses are used , the system behavior is similar to the cw case with the pump on .",
    "this is because the shg - suppression effect is determined by the ratio of the signal and pump intensities , and not by their absolute values .",
    "thus the flipped - state contrast is about the same as in the cw case . on the other hand , with the pump off  due to the nonlinear nature of shg  the output signal pulse will be significantly distorted .",
    "this gives rise to a low unflipped - state contrast .",
    "first , for small pnm , the pulse distortion arises from the linear dependence of the shg period on the signal amplitude @xmath166 .",
    "this is a fundamental difficulty inherent to shg ; to overcome this pulse distortion one would require nearly - flat - top super - gaussian pulses . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the amplitude and phase profiles of the output signal in the fundamental level with the pump off . for a gaussian pulse ,",

    "finally , in section [ pwm ] , we present numerical simulations for pulsed inputs .      the schematic setup of our fabry - perot switch is shown in fig .  [ fig12 ] .",
    "it is composed of a @xmath0 waveguide designed to support pm or qpm sfg for the signal and pump waves .",

    "[ fig12 ] shows a planar fabry - perot cavity , in practice a spherical cavity will be more robust against mirror divergence or misalignment .",
    "of course , one can also replace the reflective coatings with two mirrors .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our analysis to these types of setups .    for simplicity , in the following we consider identical , lossless coatings on the two end faces .",

    "this behavior shows that the cavity is highly reflective only in the cqz regime . in the iqz regime , on the other hand , a significant portion of the signal is lost owing to the presence of the sf - dissipation channel .",
    "it is , therefore , optimal to operate the switch in the cqz regime .",
    "we now give a physical explanation as to why all - optical switching is more efficient in the cqz regime than in the iqz regime .",
    "it is well known that light transmission through a cavity relies on the destructive interference of the reflected light and the light leaking from the cavity through the input coupler ( the left - end coating in our design ) .",
    "cavity reflectivity is then achieved by eliminating this destructive interference .",
    "there are two ways to accomplish this : ( a ) by diminishing the amplitude of the leaking light or ( b ) by modulating its phase .",

    "@xcite , for example , are based on the principle in ( b ) , where the cavity resonance is _ shifted _ by modifying the refractive index of the intra - cavity material .",
    "comparatively , the latter design allows a higher reflectance and weaker photon loss for similar parameters . this is because unlike in the jf switch , here a portion of the light entering the cavity is `` recycled '' as it leaks backwards from the cavity and eventually recombines with the reflected beam .    in our design ,",
    "both the amplitude and phase modulation effects exist . in the iqz regime ,",
    "the dominant processes are a combination of the two and subsequent loss of the signal and the pump fields from the cavity . in this case",
    ", the switch operates on amplitude modulation , or more precisely , amplitude dissipation .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the mechanism in the jf switch , as both are based on two - photon absorption .",
    "the ultimate cavity reflectance is @xmath174 , which is achieved when the two - photon absorption is @xmath218 . in the cqz regime , on the other hand , the cavity fields undergo a coherent dynamics . depending on the value of @xmath176 ( the reflectivity of the coatings for the sf light ) , the switch can be operated on either principle . in the first case , for @xmath219 , the sf field",
    "is mostly lost through the coatings , resulting in a strong loss of the signal field from the cavity after each cavity cycle .",
    "the switch is then effectively a iqz - based switch , working on amplitude modulation .",

    "is mostly stored in the cavity .",
    "the signal field then undergoes a coherent , oscillatory dynamical evolution , incurring a @xmath33 phase shift . as a result",
    ", the destructive interference at the input coupler is destroyed , leading to reflectance from the cavity .",
    "the ultimate reflectance is @xmath221 , which is higher than in the iqz regime above by an amount of @xmath222 .",
    "this improvement can be very useful for cavity - based all - optical switching , especially when short pulses are used @xcite .",
    "working on phase - modulation , this switch is similar to the designs in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , there is an important difference . in the cited designs ,",
    "the pump photons are destroyed , for example , to create free carriers , leading to physical energy dissipation .",
    "this feature also prevents their potential operation in the quantum domain due to an increased number of noise channels that are coupled in .",
    "our scheme , however , does not involve dissipation of any kind .",
    "in fact , _ it is the potential for the sfg process that changes the cavity from transmissive to reflective_. in this sense , our switch is very `` clean '' and , therefore , suitable for quantum applications ( as we recently showed for an equivalent microdisk model @xcite ) .    to graphically present these arguments , in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] we plot the cavity reflectance as a function of @xmath176 .",

    "we note first that for any cavity - based switch , the spectral width of the cavity must be much wider than the bandwidth of the incident pulse in order to avoid distortion of the switched output pulse @xcite . in our design ,",
