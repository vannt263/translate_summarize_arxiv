    "bose - einstein condensates have become a formidable tool for studying basic fundamentals of atomic physics @xcite . when confined to an optical lattice",
    "they serve as an interesting analogue to a solid - state system @xcite , providing means to study solid - state phenomena at an unprecedented level of parameter control .",
    "these include quantum phase transitions from the superfluid to mott - insulator regimes @xcite , transport phenomena @xcite , anderson localization @xcite , low - dimensional systems @xcite , discrete breathers @xcite and solitons @xcite .",
    "the latter can exist both with or without a periodic potential , although a lattice environment makes it possible for solitons and discrete breathers to exist even when the interactions in the bec are repulsive ( `` gap solitons '' ) @xcite .",
    "such states have been observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "several other methods have been proposed in the literature , including the use of an additional harmonic potential @xcite and boundary dissipations @xcite , which could also be used for non - demolition probing of these states @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a second atomic species , i.e. the creation of a binary mixture of bose - einstein condensates leads to even richer physics . in a harmonic trap",
    "the two species may be immiscible due to the interspecies interaction , leading to phase separation @xcite . in an effectively one - dimensional environment ,",
    "the repulsive interaction between atoms of different species ( ` interspecies ' interactions ) during the formation of the condensate can leave the mixture far from its ground state @xcite .",
    "the interspecies interactions heavily influence the transport properties of a condensate in a lattice @xcite .",
    "repulsive interactions enable the formation and extend the stability region of the so - called _ symbiotic _ gap solitons @xcite , i.e. two - species solitons localized together in the same spot of the lattice .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , an attractive interspecies interaction may split the two overlapping solitons @xcite .",
    "so far most of the work has concentrated on the existence of two - species solitons and their stability @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a complementary approach  we start with well - defined single - species discrete solitons ( two travelling breathers or a self - trapped state and a travelling breather , the first made of one species and the other of the second species ) far apart in the lattice and simulate their collisions . for a single species bec confined to a one - dimensional lattice collisions of travelling breathers",
    "have been analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "such an approach has also been used in the case of binary becs in harmonic traps @xcite .",
    "we perform our simulations using experimentally reachable conditions , with specific reference to two feasible experiments of two - species becs in optical lattices .",
    "the first of these experiments of interest has been performed in kyoto where becs of yb atoms have been obtained separately with isotopes @xmath2yb @xcite and @xmath3yb @xcite , as well as a mixture of isotopes @xmath2yb and @xmath4yb @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the mixture case , however , the latter component quickly collapses due to its negative intraspecies scattering length .",
    "the intra- and interspecies scattering lengths of ytterbium isotopes have been measured using data from one- @xcite and two - color photoassociation spectroscopy @xcite and are now well established .",
    "the rich isotope structure of ytterbium enables mass tuning of the scattering length .",
    "it has been shown that , unlike in alkali - metal species , optical feshbach resonances can be used to effectively change the intraspecies scattering length @xcite , thus raising hope for optical control of interactions between different isotopes .",
    "three bosonic isotopes of ytterbium , namely @xmath5yb have positive intraspecies scattering lengths of the order of a few nanometers leading to similar stable condensates .",
    "since the isotope shifts are small compared to the detuning of the far off resonant trap ( fort ) , the potential seen by different isotopes is basically identical .",
    "even though these three isotopes are similar in terms of the single - species scattering length , the interspecies interactions of different pairs of isotopes differ dramatically .",
    "the interaction between a @xmath3yb and @xmath2yb atoms is described by a large negative scattering length of -27.3  nm , while for @xmath6yb and @xmath3yb it is positive and equal to 6.2  nm .",
    "halfway between these two is the case of @xmath6yb and @xmath2yb characterised by a negligible scattering length of 0.13(18 )  nm , where the two condensate species should essentially ignore each other .",
    "recently , an interesting mixture of heteronuclear becs has been obtained in an experiment of thalhammer et al .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath1k and @xmath0rb atoms are condensed together in an optical lattice .",
    "a remarkable property of this mixture is that the interspecies scattering length @xmath7 describing the effective interaction of colliding potassium and rubidium atoms can be tuned over a wide ( both positive and negative ) range using a magnetic feshbach resonance , while the single - species scattering length remains positive for either species .",
    "we present an analysis of the interaction and collisional behavior of discrete breathers in two - species bec in optical lattices in the tight - binding approximation which has been successfully used to describe single - species experiments @xcite . in section",
    "ii the derivation of the model and an estimate of the parameters are provided .",
    "interaction of stationary breathers in close proximity to each other is described in section iii .",
    "collision of traveling breathers and trapped states are described in section iv as a function of the interspecies coupling parameter .",
    "section v provides an explanation of the different kind of collisions observed in the numerical simulations where inelastic behavior is found in the mutually - repulsive case and elastic in the mutually - attractive case .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the two - species bose gas with the use of the tight - binding approximation , following the treatment described in @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equations describing the dynamics of the two species order parameters @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) read @xmath10 where the coefficients @xmath11 describe the effective mean - field intra- and interspecies interactions and are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reduced mass of the atomic pair and @xmath14 is the scattering length relevant in the scattering properties of the species atoms .    the external potential confining the becs is due to two overlapping and counter - propagating laser beams that create a standing wave in the axial direction and , as a result , a periodic potential of depth @xmath15 .",
    "the gaussian profile of the two laser beams gives rise to an approximately harmonic off - axis confinement described by the frequencies @xmath16 .",
    "thus the external potential reads @xmath17 note that real optical lattices also have a shallow harmonic potential superimposed in the axial direction , which we here assume to have negligible effects .",
    "we also introduce the lattice strengths @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the recoil energy calculated for the lattice wavelength .",
    "the axial on - site frequency of the lattice is then @xmath20 .",
    "both order parameters obey the normalisation condition @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the total number of atoms of the @xmath23-th species in the lattice .",
    "if the lattice is strong enough , i.e. the trap depth is sufficiently large , the condensate is well localised around potential minima . for each of the mixture s",
    "order parameters we use the following _ ansatz _ @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an on - site wavefunction and @xmath26 is the location of the @xmath27-th lattice site seen by the @xmath23-th species . when the atomic interactions are weak , the on - site ground state wavefunction can be replaced by the ground state harmonic oscillator wavefunction in the off - axis direction and a wannier function @xcite of the lowest band in the axial direction to account for tunneling .",
    "consequently , @xmath28 may be interpreted as the number of @xmath23-th species atoms in the @xmath27-th lattice site as a function of time and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hopping integral describing the tunneling of the @xmath23-th species and is proportional to the intersite tunneling rate @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is the on - site chemical potential .",
    "the self- and mutual interaction is described by the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .      in order to move towards a more standard and computationally efficient form of two coupled discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse )",
    ", we introduce @xmath35 to obtain : @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ cdnls1]-[cdnls2 ] ) we have defined the following parameters : @xmath37 thus the atomic distribution of each species over the entire lattice is normalized to unity : @xmath38 to ensure that the energy and density in the system are conserved , we use a symplectic fourth - order integrator of the yoshida type @xcite . the energy and density are both conserved up to 9 decimal places at each integration time step .",
    ".values of parameters used in the simulations[parametertable ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in section iii(a ) we present results that model different bose gas mixtures , notably mixtures of ytterbium isotopes and that of @xmath1k+@xmath0rb . at present",
    ", the only ytterbium isotope mixture bec obtained so far is that of @xmath2yb+@xmath4yb where , however , the @xmath4yb part instantly collapses because of its negative scattering length @xcite .",
    "thus we focus on ytterbium mixtures of isotopes whose scattering length is positive , namely @xmath6yb , @xmath3yb and @xmath2yb . the latter two have already reached bec separately @xcite while the major technical difficulty in reaching a @xmath6yb bec is its low natural abundance of 0.13% .    to calculate the self nonlinear parameter , @xmath39 , it is sufficient to approximate the on - site wavefunction @xmath40 with a harmonic oscillator ground state , which is basically a gaussian , to yield @xmath41 in the case of ytterbium mixtures the mutual interaction parameter @xmath42 can also be estimated from the above formula as the masses of the two isotopes are very similar and the two wavefunctions are well overlapped .    in the case of the @xmath1k+@xmath0rb mixture",
    "the two wavefunctions are differently shaped ( one is narrower than the other due to the difference in masses ) .",
    "the difference in the masses of the two species has a further effect - the two clouds are separated due to gravity but an additional laser can be used to force overlap of the two species @xcite .",
    "the scattering length of @xmath0rb is 5.25  nm @xcite while for @xmath1k it is 3.1  nm @xcite .",
    "the interspecies scattering length can be changed by the use of a convenient magnetic feshbach resonance @xcite so that @xmath42 can be considered as a free parameter .    to estimate the tunneling rates @xmath43 , it is not sufficient to approximate the on - site wavefunctions with gaussians and one has to use the wannier wavefunctions .",
    "this is because the tunneling rate is mostly determined by the wings of the on - site wavefunction which have an oscillatory - exponential rather than a gaussian tail . in this case",
    "the tunneling rate can be approximated as @xcite @xmath44 the parameters for the ytterbium isotopes considered here are as follows .",
    "the lattice laser wavelength is @xmath45  nm ; the lattice frequencies for both species are @xmath46  hz and @xmath47  khz which are close to the experimental realizations . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider @xmath48 as it is difficult to find initial conditions that would lead to a _ clear _ traveling breather at larger densities .",
    "this is a general property of gap solitons @xcite .",
    "the results apply , however , to larger values of @xmath22 up to @xmath49 .    in the case of the @xmath0rb and @xmath1k mixture",
    "we consider a lattice wavelength of 1064  nm and we take the ( tunable ) lattice depth to be @xmath50 for rubidium so that the same parameter for potassium is around 3 .",
    "this is done to ensure that we can still use the tight - binding approximation ( i.e. tunneling rates to further sites are at least an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath43 , see table i in @xcite ) . on the other side",
    "the tunneling rate needs to be large enough for traveling breathers to exist .",
    "the calculation parameters discussed above are shown in table [ parametertable ] .",
    "yb + @xmath3yb mixture for ( a)@xmath51 and ( b)@xmath52 . both images show only the evolution of the @xmath6yb part of the mixture since the @xmath3yb evolution is rather straightforward , with the breather highly localised in the centre . the majority of @xmath6yb atoms forms a travelling breather while the remaining atomic density is absorbed by the @xmath3yb breather to form a symbiotic breather .",
    "the travelling breather reflects off the nearest boundary and then off the @xmath3yb breather in the centre of the lattice .",
    "[ figured8d11 ] ]    it has been demonstrated that initially gaussian wavepackets can evolve via the single species dnlse into static breathers @xcite . if the wavepacket is given a momentum in a certain direction , travelling breathers that translate across the lattice can also be formed .",

    "however , when the pseudomomentum crosses @xmath57 and the repulsive self - interaction @xmath59 is not too large , travelling breathers are formed ( unless @xmath58 is exactly 1 , in which case the breather is stationary ) @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we run simulations starting from stationary breathers of @xmath6yb and @xmath3yb in separate positions .",
    "these are formed by running simulations of initially gaussian wavepackets with @xmath60 and letting them reshape with dissipation applied at the boundaries to get rid of the background ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the effects of dissipation ) .",
    "once the breathers are formed and the background noise has vanished , we turn dissipations off and set @xmath61 to the value of 2.51 .    for each simulation",
    ", we change the initial distance @xmath62 between the centres of the single - species breathers and then study the breather interaction . with the stationary breathers",

    ", we see that less of the @xmath6yb atoms join with the symbiotic breather and more are expelled into the background . a small travelling breather",

    "[ figured8d11](b ) , for @xmath52 , we see that the symbiotic breather is not formed anymore and the travelling breather is denser , and slower , than that formed for @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ figured8d11](a ) ) .",
    "this is due to the initial density profile for @xmath52 , in which the breathers do not overlap any longer .",

    "figure [ figure8 ] shows the parameters @xmath101 , @xmath100 , @xmath102 and the fwhm as a function of the mutual interaction parameter @xmath61 . for each value of @xmath61",
    "a simulation was performed up to @xmath103 , just past the collision .",
    "the initial conditions and interaction parameters are the same as in fig.[figure1 ] , except for the scanned @xmath61 and the tunneling ratio @xmath104 , which is set to 1 .",
    "four different regimes can be identified from fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] . on the left , for @xmath61 lower than about @xmath105 ,",
    "two traveling breathers collide elastically and remain basically unaffected by the collision .",
    "this is the situation shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "then , there is a transition point at @xmath106 where the each breather splits into two as they collide .",
    "this results in a sudden increase of @xmath107 for each species .",
    "note that this increase differs between the two species ; for @xmath2yb it s maximum is located at @xmath108 as opposed to @xmath109 for @xmath3yb , quite probably as a result of the different self - interaction parameters .    for small , but positive values of @xmath61 ( i.e. less than 6 ) the two breathers tunnel through each other .",
    "note that @xmath107 remains low in this regime ( about 15 sites , growing slowly to 20 ) which means that the breathers are not destroyed .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] for @xmath110 . as the two breathers tunnel through each other",
    ", a part of their wavefunction is trapped inside the other soliton ; this effect grows as the interspecies interaction increases leading to a slow increase in the standard deviation of the atomic density distributions .",
    "a rather sudden change takes place at about @xmath111 .",
    "the system becomes visibly sensitive to small changes in the mutual interaction .",
    "this is the regime where the collision results in the destruction of the two breathers .",
    "[ figure3 ] is an example of such a case .",
    "the process is chaotic , yet in many cases leads to the creation of a double - species symbiotic breather manifested by its very low fwhm .",
    "the presented results can be reasonably explained by using one of the key phenomena at the base of gap solitons : the _ negative effective mass_. the dynamics of a gap soliton in an external potential are exactly opposite to what one would expect - a gap soliton attempts to climb potential hills and in itself is a balance between its negative effective mass that tries to make it collapse and its repulsive self - interaction that prevents it @xcite . in fact , the variational model of a wavepacket used in trombettoni _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that the wavepacket center obeys a newton - like dynamics when @xmath112 and exactly the contrary when @xmath113 .",
    "this ` contrary ' behavior of the solitons seems to be the key to the explanation of our findings .",
    "the totally elastic collision encountered when the interspecies interaction is highly _ attractive _ would be caused by the fact that the solitons ` see ' each other as potential walls rather than wells .",
    "the splitting behavior has been investigated in a slightly different context by matuszewski _",
    "@xcite where the dynamics of two already overlapped stationary solitons was analyzed . in our case",
    "splitting happens if the attractive interaction is small enough to let the two breathers overlap briefly .",
    "then the system becomes unstable and each breather splits in two .",
    "it is also possible to look at this phenomenon from a different angle . due to its negative effective mass ,",
    "the split of the breather is quite similar to the case of a wavepacket encountering a potential barrier where , depending on the barrier height ( or the interaction between the breathers ) part of the wavepacket goes through while the rest is reflected .    in the repulsive interaction regime",
    "the breathers behave as if they saw each other as potential wells .",
    "this is again an effect of their negative effective mass and , consequently , reversed dynamics .",
    "thus , for the collision s duration , their speed increases ( at the cost of wavepacket spreading and of reducing their energy due to atomic self - interaction ) .    the chaotic behavior when the interspecies interaction is large and repulsive is probably caused by the system entering an unstable regime as predicted by gubeskys _ _ et al.__@xcite . the chaotic dynamics would then cause the destruction of the original two breathers and possibly the creation of a stable _ intragap _ soliton .",
    "it is beyond the capabilities of our model to establish if it is possible for an _ intergap _ soliton to emerge during the collision since the tight - binding approximation is limited to the lowest band - gap by definition .",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of interacting and colliding discrete breathers in bec composed of different atomic species in optical lattices . we have found that the interaction depends on the initial distance of the two breathers and led either to the formation of a symbiotic solitons or to the setup in motion of one of the two breathers .",
    "the collision outcome depends both on the tunneling rate ratios of the two species , as well as the interspecies interactions .",
    "when the tunneling rates differ greatly , as in the @xmath1k+@xmath0rb mixture , one of the breathers acts as an effective potential wall to the other and the whole process can be viewed as a case of one - particle scattering on a potential wall .    in the case where the tunneling rates are comparable ( like in the case of mixtures of ytterbium isotopes ) we have identified four collision regimes . for large negative scattering lengths",
    "the collision is elastic and the two traveling breathers remain intact , with considerable momentum transfer between the two . for small negative scattering rates , the breathers overlap briefly and split in two , as originally predicted in @xcite . when the interspecies interaction is weakly repulsive , the two breathers tunnel through each other unharmed for a wide range of interspecies interacions . finally , with the interspecies interaction sufficiently large",
    ", the dynamics becomes chaotic and the two breathers are destroyed with a possible creation a new two - component soliton similar to an _ intragap _ soliton as predicted in @xcite .",
    "feasible explanations to the above phenomena have been provided using the concept of negative effective mass and the resulting reversed dynamics .",
    "interaction and collision properties of localized excitations in bec in optical lattices can have interesting applications in the realization of ultracold bose - fermi mixtures where gap solitons can be viewed as matter - wave counterparts of quantum dots and antidots @xcite . changing the species interaction",
    "allows one to tune the character of the collisions from fully elastic to fully inelastic and/or tunneling with clear advantages in the manipulation of information in matter - wave systems .",
