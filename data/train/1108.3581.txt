    "for the first years after the quark model was accepted it was believed that the lightest scalar meson should be a quark - antiquark composite with mass value similar to those of the tensor and axial vector mesons . in particular , an occasionally discussed light , broad  sigma meson \" was not expected to exist .",
    "however , more recent work has provided evidence for such a particle as well as for other similar light scalars .",
    "( some characteristic references are @xcite - @xcite . )    in fact there seem to be enough scalar candidates to fill up two different nonets . a model including these states , with also two nonets of low lying pseudoscalars in order to form chiral multiplets",
    "has been studied in some detail ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that chiral symmetry is the exact symmetry of qcd with massless quarks .",
    "adding  soft \" quark mass terms results in  sigma models \" which give many reasonable low energy predictions . in the models just mentioned one chiral ( i.e. containing both scalars and pseudoscalars ) nonet is supposed to represent states with a quark - antiquark substructure while the other nonet is supposed to represent states with a two quark - two antiquark substructure .",
    "the physical states are suitable linear combinations .    on the experimental side of the subject , information on the light scalars",
    "has often been extracted from study of pion pion and other scattering processes .",
    "another way is to search for scalar resonances explicitly in particle decay processes .",
    "recently , the cleo collaboration has reported @xcite good evidence for the scalar @xmath0(980 ) in the semi - leptonic decay of the @xmath1(1968 ) meson .",
    "since there is more phase space available , it may be possible to find other scalar iso - singlet states in this and similar semi - leptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "there are also isosinglet pseudoscalar states like the @xmath2 and @xmath3(980 ) which can be studied and in fact have been already reported in the decays of the @xmath1(1968 ) .    as a possibly helpful adjunct to future work in this direction we will , in the present paper , make some theoretical estimates of the semi - leptonic decay widths of the @xmath1(1968 ) into the four scalar isosinglet states and the four pseudoscalar isosinglet states which are predicted in the chiral model mentioned above .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the hadronic  weak currents \" which are needed for the calculation .",
    "these are mathematically given by the so - called noether currents of the sigma model lagrangian being employed .",
    "we work in the approximation where renormalization of these currents from the symmetry limit are neglected .",
    "this means that there are no arbitrary parameters available to us .",
    "nevertheless there are some subtleties .",
    "to explain these we build up the model in three stages rather than just writing the final result immediately .    in section iii",
    "we give a detailed description of the calculation of the partial decay widths from the currents discussed in section ii .",
    "for this purpose we also use information on the scalar and pseudoscalar meson masses and mixings obtained in @xcite .",
    "a short summary and discussion is given in section iv .",
    "in appendix a we briefly discuss the well known @xmath43 decay which has the same general structure as the semi - leptonic @xmath5 decays .",
    "these models give the usual `` current algebra '' results near the threshold of pion - pion scattering but also yield some additional interesting features away from threshold .      the usual chiral nonet @xmath6 realizing the @xmath7 structure of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons is schematically written with chiral su(3 ) indices displayed as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively flavor and color indices . for clarity , on the left hand side",
    "the undotted index transforms under the left su(3 ) while the dotted index transforms under the right su(3 ) .",
    "the decomposition in terms of scalar and pseudoscalar fields is :    @xmath11    using matrix notation ( e.g. @xmath12 ) the noether vector and axial currents read ( see for example appendix a of @xcite ) ,    @xmath13    the axial symmetry breaking is measured by the vacuum value of @xmath14 : @xmath15 where the normalization is @xmath16 130.4 mev and @xmath17 156.1 mev .",
    "note that the overall normalization constant for @xmath18 gives the correct value for the ordinary electromagnetic current .",
    "this determines the normalization for the weak currents in the su(3)@xmath19 @xmath20 su(3)@xmath21 symmetry limit . for the vector currents this amounts to an implementation of the  conserved vector current hypothesis \" introduced for beta decay many years ago @xcite .",
    "such an approximation is well known not to be as good for the axial current case , but may at least furnish an order of magnitude estimate . in detail , with the usual su(3 ) tensor indices , the currents read : @xmath22    for example , the relevant hadronic current needed to describe the semi - leptonic decay @xmath23 + @xmath24 + @xmath25 is    @xmath26    a relevant application of this formula is given in appendix a.      for this model we first introduce another chiral field , @xmath28 constructed out of two quarks and two anti - quarks as :    @xmath29    this object has the form of a  molecule \" made of two @xmath30 s . alternatively one can schematically make two quark- two antiquark states denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , from a diquark combined with an anti - diquark in two different ways @xcite .",
    "one might as well consider the most general linear combination of @xmath33 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 as a field representing an object , @xmath34 made from two quarks plus two antiquarks .",
    "@xmath34 has the decomposition ,    @xmath35    then the noether currents involve the sum of pieces constructed from the unprimed fields and from the primed fields .",
    "the latter take the form ,    @xmath36    wherein , @xmath37    the total currents are denoted as :    @xmath38    in contrast to the chiral su(3 ) model above , all the primed and corresponding unprimed fields mix to give physical fields of definite mass . as a simple example , the transformation between the physical @xmath39 and @xmath40 fields and the original fields ( say @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) is @xcite : @xmath43 = r_\\pi^{-1 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                          \\phi_1 ^ 2 \\\\                          { \\phi'}_1 ^ 2 \\end{array } \\right]= \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c }                  \\cos\\theta_\\pi & - \\sin \\theta_\\pi \\nonumber                \\\\",
    "\\sin \\theta_\\pi & \\cos \\theta_\\pi \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                          \\phi_1 ^ 2 \\\\                          { \\phi'}_1 ^ 2 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{mixingangle}\\ ] ] which also defines the transformation matrix , @xmath44 .    the pion decay constant as well as ( formally ) the decay constant for the much heavier @xmath45 particle are defined by the part of the axial current linear in the fields : @xmath46 the angle @xmath47 depends on the detailed dynamics .",
    "@xcite    in what follows it will be useful for us to specify the mixing matrix for the four isoscalar scalar mesons in this model .",
    "a basis for these states is given in terms of the four component vector @xmath48 @xmath49 where ,    @xmath50    in the above , the quark content is indicated on the right for convenience .",
    "note that @xmath51 stands for a strange quark while @xmath52 stands for a non - strange quark .",
    "however these basis states are not mass eigenstates .",
    "again , the detailed dynamics of the model is required to specify this . for typical values of the model s input parameters ( see @xcite ) the mass eigenstates make up a four vector , @xmath53 = @xmath54 with ,    @xmath55 \\label{4by4rots}\\ ] ]    the physical states are identified , with nominal mass values , as @xmath56 \\label{fphys}\\ ] ]    it will also be interesting for us to give the typical result of the model for the mixing of the four isoscalar pseudoscalars .",
    "the analogous basis states are :    @xmath57    for typical values of the model s input parameters ( see @xcite ) the mass eigenstates make up a four component vector , @xmath58 = @xmath59 with ,    @xmath60 \\label{etaphys}\\ ] ]    ( these identifications correspond to the favored scenario discussed in section v of @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamically determined mixing matrix is then :    @xmath61 \\label{mms}\\ ] ]",
    "as recently discussed in @xcite , the case of three flavors is special in the sense that it is the only one in which a two quark - two antiquark field has the correct chiral transformation property to mix ( in the chiral limit ) with @xmath30 . in order to respect this property",
    "when a heavy meson is included in the lagrangian , we should demand that `` heavy '' spin zero mesons be made of just one quark and one antiquark . in a linear sigma model the kinetic term would then be written as :    @xmath63    where the meaning of the superscript on the trace symbol is that the first term should be summed over the heavy quark index as well as the three light indices .",
    "this stands in contrast to the second term which is just summed over the three light quark indices pertaining to the two quark - two antiquark field @xmath34 .",
    "since the noether currents are sensitive only to these kinetic terms in the model , the vector and axial vector currents with flavor indices 1 through 3 in this model are just the same as in eq.([totalsu3currents ] ) above .",
    "however if either or both flavor indices take on the value 4 ( referring to the heavy flavor ) the current will only have contributions from the field @xmath30 .",
    "this should be clarified by the following example ,    @xmath64    here the unspecified indices can run from 1 to 4 .",
    "this equation is correct by construction but does not tell the whole story since the connection between the fields above and the physical states involves , as in the preceding cases , the details of the non - derivative ( `` potential '' ) terms of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the initial motivation for this work was the recent experimental discovery @xcite of the semileptonic decay mode ,    @xmath65    in which the @xmath66 was identified from its two pion decay mode .",
    "a relevant generalization is to consider other scalar isosinglet candidates than the @xmath66 . for example",
    "the su(3 ) @xmath30 - @xmath34 model contains four different isoscalar scalars , @xmath67 . in addition , there are four different isoscalar pseudoscalars in that model , @xmath68 . here",
    "we shall calculate the predictions of that model for all eight of these decays in the simplest approximation .",
    "this should provide some useful orientation .",
    "in fact there are no parameters which have not already been determined in the previous treatment @xcite of the model .",
    "the usual weak interaction lagrangian is ,    @xmath69    wherein ,    @xmath70    here the column vectors of the quark fields take the form :    @xmath71,\\quad\\quad d=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } d\\\\ s\\\\ b\\end{array}\\right ] , \\label{eq : udcol}\\ ] ]    and the ckm matrix , @xmath72 is explicitly ,    @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{eq : ckm}\\ ] ]    a picture describing the relevant @xmath5 decays is given in fig .",
    "( [ ds ] ) .",
    "the corresponding semi - leptonic decay amplitudes are thus ,    @xmath74    where the spinor @xmath75 represents the outgoing @xmath24 and @xmath76 represents the outgoing @xmath25 .",
    "the relevant hadronic operators can be rewritten in terms of the mass eigenstate scalar isosinglets and the pseudoscalar isosinglets using eqs .",
    "( [ fphys ] ) and ( [ etaphys ] ) as :    @xmath77    @xmath78    the transposed matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ 4by4rots ] ) and ( [ mms ] ) respectively , based on a typical numerical solution for the model parameters @xcite .",
    "next the amplitudes are given by ,    @xmath81    the squared amplitudes , summed over the emitted lepton s spins , are then , @xmath82 , \\label{sqamp}\\ ] ] wherein @xmath83 has been set to zero except for the overall @xmath84 factor .",
    "this yields the unintegrated decay width ,    @xmath85    for integrating this expression we need ,    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the mass of the isosinglet meson @xmath67 or @xmath68 and also the indefinite integral formula , where @xmath88 ,    @xmath89    table [ pscalars ] summarizes the calculations of the predicted widths , for @xmath1 decays into the four pseudoscalar singlet mesons ( @xmath90(547 ) , @xmath91(982 ) , @xmath92(1225 ) , @xmath93(1794 ) .",
    "notice that the listed masses , @xmath87 are the  predicted \" ones in the present model ) and leptons .    .pseudoscalars . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     experimental data exist for only three of these eight decay modes .",
    "@xmath94    it is encouraging that even though our calculation utilized the simplest model for the current and no arbitrary parameters were introduced , the prediction for the lightest hadronic mode , @xmath95 agrees with the measured value . in the case of the decay",
    "@xmath96 the predicted width is about 30@xmath97 less than the measured value . for the mode @xmath98 our predicted value is about one third the measured value .",
    "conceivably , considering the large predicted width into the very broad sigma state centered at 477 mev , some of the higher mass sigma events might have been counted as @xmath0(980 ) events , which would improve the agreement .",
    "it would be very interesting to obtain experimental information about the energy regions relevant to the other five predicted isosinglet modes .",
    "furthermore , these width predictions are based on eqs .",
    "( [ 4by4rots ] ) and ( [ mms ] ) corresponding to particular choices for the quark mass ratio @xmath99 and the precise mass of the very broad @xmath100(1300 ) resonance .",
    "varying these within the allowable ranges gives rise to the allowed range of predictions displayed in figs .",
    "( [ etas ] ) and ( [ fs ] ) .",
    "one can see that raising m[@xmath100(1300 ) ] and/or lowering @xmath99 yields better agreement for the predicted semi - leptonic decay width of the @xmath0(980 ) .",
    "clearly , the simple model here provides reasonable estimates for the semileptonic decay widths of the @xmath1(1968 ) .",
    "= 5 cm = 5 cm +    = 5 cm = 5 cm    = 5 cm = 5 cm +    = 5 cm = 5 cm",
    "we saw that the partial widths for semi - leptonic decays of the @xmath1(1968 ) into isoscalar scalar singlets and pseudoscalar singlets plus leptons could be well estimated in a simple model where the hadronic current was taken to be the noether current associated with a minimal linear sigma model .",
    "the agreement between experiment and theory was better for the decays into the @xmath2 and @xmath3 than for the decay into the @xmath0(980 ) .",
    "the former involve the hadronic vector current , which is  protected \" according to the conserved vector current hypothesis , while the latter involves the  unprotected \" axial vector current",
    ".    clearly it would be interesting to try this technique for other semi - leptonic decays of charmed mesons and also for bottom mesons .",
    "we considered the case when the charged lepton was @xmath24 rather than the cases of @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "in those two cases an additional form factor as in the calculation of the @xmath43 decay discussed in appendix a should be taken into account .",
    "information about the scalars , involving however more work for disentangling the effects of the strong interaction , can also be obtained from the non - leptonic decay modes of the charm and bottom mesons .",
    "a treatment of @xmath103 has already been carried out @xcite .",
    "the study of the decay like @xmath104 might be useful for learning about mixing between a @xmath105 scalar and the lighter three flavor scalars .",
    "a straightforward , but not necessarily short , improvement of this calculation would be to include both vector and axial vector mesons in the starting lagrangian from which the currents are calculated .",
