    "thermal models for the production of final - state hadrons in nuclear collisions have been extremely successful over a wide range of collision energies ranging from the bevalac / sis , over the ags and sps , to the rhic @xcite .",
    "the parametric dependences of the temperature @xmath0 and baryon chemical potential @xmath1 on the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy @xmath2 map out two lines in the phase diagram , which are usually called the _ chemical _ and _ thermal freeze - out _ lines .",
    "the chemical freeze - out line @xmath3 is deduced from the abundance ratios of different species of hadrons , while the thermal freeze - out line @xmath4 is deduced from the slopes of the transverse momentum spectra of the emitted hadrons .",
    "what do these results tell us about qcd except that the hadronic matter at freeze - out is quite well described by a state of thermal and chemical equilibrium ?",
    "firstly , rather strong arguments have been presented that the chemical and thermal equilibrium can only be established by some complex `` prehadronic '' dynamics , which requires the presence of gluons as dynamical degrees of fredom @xcite .",
    "secondly , the thermal equilibrium description requires the assumption of a strong transverse collective flow of the matter at freeze - out , which exhibits an increasing degree of azimuthal anisotropy as the cm energy increases .",
    "this effect , called elliptic flow @xcite , indicates the presence of a strong transverse pressure very soon ( 1 fm / c ) after the begin of the nuclear reaction @xcite .    as the chemical freeze - out",
    "parameters at sps and rhic energies are very close to the expected phase boundary between hadronic matter and the quark - gluon plasma , it is reasonable to conjecture that the produced matter was first thermalized in the deconfined phase and then evolved through the phase boundary into a thermal gas of hadrons .",
    "the crucial question is whether any signatures remain in hadronic observables that carry information about this evolution prior to the final freeze - out .",
    "as i will explain , there are reasons to believe that statistical fluctuations @xcite in certain hadronic observables may preserve information about earlier times , even though their averages only tell us about the freeze - out conditions .",
    "it is here where the finite volume and the finite life - time of the hadronic fireball produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions turn out to be advantages rather than deficiencies .",
    "the relative size of fluctuations in thermodynamic observables , as compared to the average values , decreases inversely with the volume @xmath5 of the system . and",
    "if the system would evolve infintely slowly , the fluctuations at freeze - out would only reflect the freeze - out conditions .",
    "the talk is organized as follows : after a brief review of statistical fluctuations in parts of an equilibrated system , i will discuss fluctuations in the momentum spectra of emitted particles , and later fluctuations in particle abundances , or chemical fluctuations , where the main emphasis will be on the fluctuations of conserved quantum numbers .",
    "the talk will conclude with some experimentally relevant considerations and an outlook .",
    "consider small subsystem of a large system in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "let us ask how the average energy @xmath7 contained in the subvolume @xmath5 changes as a function of temperature . a straightforward calculation yields : @xmath8 as the right - hand side is just the fluctuation of the energy contained in @xmath5 , we have obtained the important result , that the energy fluctuations are determined by the heat capacity of the matter in the subvolume : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the heat cpaacity . fluctuations of other ( conserved ) quantities @xmath11 can be calculated in a similar way , by considering the variation of the grand canonical average @xmath12 with respect to a change in the chemical potential @xmath1 associated with @xmath11 : @xmath13 the expression on the right - hand side , apart from the factor @xmath0 , is called the _ susceptibility _",
    "@xmath14 , which measures the response of the medium to a change in the chemical potenial .",
    "associate with the observable @xmath11 .",
    "an important example is the magnetic susceptibility @xmath15 , where the observable is given by the magnetization @xmath16 , and the magnetic field @xmath17 assumes the role of the chemical potential .",
    "examples of interest in the case of hadronic matter are the chiral susceptibility @xmath18 and the polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath19 , which measure the response of the medium to a change in the quark mass , and to the addition of a free heavy quark , respectively .",
    "as outlined above , fluctuations of the thermal energy in a given subvolume are a measure of the change of the average thermal energy with temperature , i.e. the heat capacity of the matter contained in the subvolume .",
    "a similar relation connects the fluctuations of the local temperature to the heat capacity @xmath10 : @xmath20 this relation could be used to measure the specific heat of the hadronic matter created in high - energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the idea here is to use the slope of the transverse momentum spectrum of emitted particles as a measure of the temperature  assuming that the matter is thermalized  and to look for fluctuations in the event ensemble . near a critical point ,",
    "the specific heat diverges , causing the thermal fluctuations to vanish .",
    "a pronounced decrease in the observed temperature fluctuations between otherwise identical events would , therefore , indicate an approach to the critical point in the phase diagram .    the simplest way to identify temperature fluctuations is to look for fluctuations in the mean transverse momentum @xmath21 . since the increase of @xmath10 near @xmath22 is caused by the increased fluctuations of the modes associated with the order parameter  in the case of the chiral phase transition , the quark condensate @xmath23 ",
    "it should be possible to enhance the signal by considering event - by - event fluctuations of observables most sensitive to these modes . for hadronic matter , this would be the mean transverse momentum of low-@xmath24 pions , which are thought to partially arise from the decay of local excitations of the iso - singlet order parameter , the @xmath25-meson mode .    for practical purposes ,",
    "two observables have been defined @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total squared transverse momentum of all particles emitted in an event , @xmath28 is the event multiplicity , @xmath29 denotes the event average , and @xmath30 the average for the inclusive single particle distribution ; and @xcite : @xmath31 being a ratio rather than a difference , @xmath32 may be less sensitive to collective flow effects than @xmath33 .",
    "an estimate for the expected size of @xmath34 due to the fluctuations in the @xmath25-field has can be obtained in the framework of the linear sigma model @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the correlation length of the fluctuations .",
    "this prediction has to be modified for two reasons .",
    "first of all , the hadronic system does not decay into free hadrons right at the critical point , even if it reaches this point during its evolution . instead of observing the large correlation length",
    "predicted to occur at @xmath37 in equilibrium , one would thus expect to observe the reduced correlation length associated with the freeze - out parameters @xmath38 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . furthermore , even under conditions of criticality , the correlation length only diverges if the system has enough time to develop long - range fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the theory of dynamical critical phenomena yields an equation determining the change in the inverse correlation length @xmath39 as the system evolves @xcite : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the inverse correlation length in equilibrium  which vanishes at the critical point  and the relaxation rate @xmath42 with some positive exponent @xmath43 .",
    "as critical conditions are approached , the relaxation time diverges exhibiting the well - known effect of critical `` slowing down '' .    , where the transition is of second order .",
    "under favorable conditions , the hot system created in a heavy ion collision may transiently pass through the critical point , before it freezes out into hadrons that no longer interact.,width=377 ]    if the critical point is reached in a nuclear collision , the system rapidly expands across it and freezes out soon afterwards . according to ( [ eq7 ] )",
    "the correlation length @xmath44 remains smaller than @xmath45 as @xmath22 is approached from above , but then decreases less rapidly than @xmath45 .",
    "the prediction is thus that the effective correlation length at the moment of freeze - out is larger than one would expect under equilibrium conditions , reflecting the temporary proximity to the critical point @xcite .",
    "experimental data for @xmath21 fluctuations have been obtained by na49 for pb+pb collisions at the cern - sps @xcite and recently by star for au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "while the na49 data reflect mean @xmath24 fluctuations in a forward rapidity region , the star data were taken at midrapidity .",
    "na49 reported values of @xmath46 or @xmath47 mev after corrections for two - particle ( hbt ) correlations .",
    "the value from star is @xmath48 mev .",
    "fluctuations in the chemical composition of the emitted hadron yields can potentially probe the microscopic structure of the emitting matter .",
    "an example is the quark number susceptibility @xmath49 which measures the response of the net quark density to a change in the quark chemical potenial . a different , but",
    "related quantity is the chiral susceptibility @xmath50 , which measures the response of the quark condensate to a change in the current quark mass .",
    "@xmath51 has an isoscalar and an isovector component @xmath52 ^ 2 \\rangle , \\nonumber\\\\ \\chi_{\\rm ns } & = & t^{-1 } \\langle            [ \\delta(u^\\dagger u)-\\delta(d^\\dagger d)]^2 \\rangle , \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have both been determined on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the results show that @xmath53 , indicating that fluctuations in the u- and d - quark densities are uncorrelated .    as chemical properties",
    "are generally carried by particles , chemical fluctuations are determined by fluctuations in the corresponding particle numbers , and their changes are governed by particle transport processes .",
    "a weakly coupled hadronic gas ( hg ) and a perturbative quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) differ significantly in this respect , as listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "[ tab1 ]     & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56    qgp & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59     @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 qgp & @xmath63 & @xmath58 & @xmath59    this implies that measurable differences in the fluctuations associated with charge and baryon number exist between a hadron gas and a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the second important point is that fluctuations of locally conserved quantities , such as the net electric charge or the net baryon number ( or the net strangeness ! ) can not be erased by local reactions .",
    "they can only be modified due to particle transport over larger distances , i.e.  diffusion , and may thus be fixated early , if the evolution of the system is sufficiently rapid @xcite .",
    "consider the total net electric charge of all particles emitted within a rapidity window @xmath64 in a high - energy nuclear collision .",
    "the fluctuation of this quantity @xmath65 is proportional to the volume associated with emission into this rapidity window , i.e. to @xmath64 itself in a boost invariant scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate of diffusion of net charge into and out of this volume is independent of the size of the rapidity interval .",
    "therefore , early fluctuations of the net charge contained in a sufficiently large rapidity interval @xmath66 may survive .",
    "the questions are , how large is @xmath67 , and how much do the predictions for a hg and a qgp differ ?",
    "we first address the last question .",
    "we estimate the fluctuations per unit volume in the two different phases in the weak coupling limit . in the hadron gas",
    "we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the number of hadrons of species",
    "@xmath70 in the subvolume , and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) counts all ( anti-)baryons . in the quark - gluon plasma",
    "we have @xmath73 with the analogous notation of the quark numbers . neglecting the contribution from strange quarks , the net charge and baryon number fluctuations in the qgp",
    "are related as @xmath74        since it is difficult , if not impossible , to measure the size of an observed subvolume accurately , it is desirable to normalize the fluctuations to another extensive quantity .",
    "one possibility is to choose the total entropy @xmath75 , which is closely related to the total number of particles in the subvolume . for",
    "the qgp one can derive the analytical relation ( @xmath1 denotes the baryon chemical potential ) @xmath76 which also determines the charge fluctuations by virtue of ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "quantitative estimates for the hadron gas phase are somewhat more complex , requiring corrections for the decay of higher resonances .",
    "the resulting estimates for the net charge and baryon number fluctuations , divided by the entropy , are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with the qgp predictions over an energy range spanning from the sps to the lhc .",
    "the hg prediction is always significantly higher , and at rhic energies and beyond the net charge fluctuations provide for greater discrimination than the baryon fluctuations .",
    "however , we will argue shortly that early net baryon number fluctuations have a greater chance of survival in a narrow rapidity interval .    , defined by a rapidity window @xmath64 in the boost invariant bjorken model .",
    "conservation laws dictate that the total charge and baryon number in @xmath5 can only change due to particle transport through the endcaps of @xmath5.,width=453 ]    next we address the question whether the fluctuations generated during a qgp phase can survive the final state expansion in the hg phase . for simplicity , we consider the boost invariant case of a longitudinal expansion introduced by bjorken , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . considering a rapidity interval @xmath77 , we see that the left and right boundary separate from another with the relative velocity @xmath78 .",
    "the typical longitudinal velocity component of a baryon in the hadronic phase is @xmath79 implying that most baryons will not be able to move out of the rapidity interval , in which they were contained at the moment of hadronization .",
    "thus , we would expect that the baryon number fluctuations generated in a rapidity interval @xmath80 during the qgp phase will remain frozen during the hg phase .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the transport of baryons through the left- and right - hand surfaces of a cylindrical volume shows that baryon number fluctuations from the qgp phase can survive if @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of fluctuations can also be studied in the framework of transport theory @xcite .",
    "consider the distribution of particles in rapidity space as a function of proper time @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 describes the deviation from equilibrium .",
    "the relaxation toward equilibrium is described by the langevin equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the relaxation time , @xmath87 is the coefficient describing diffusion of particles in rapidity , and@xmath88 is the noise term . for a locally conserved particle density , @xmath89 , and the decay of a fluctuation @xmath90",
    "is solely governed by diffusion .",
    "making use of the equivalent fokker - planck equation for the fourier components of the rapidity fluctuations @xmath91 one can show that the gaussian width @xmath92 of the component @xmath91 satisfies the equation @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "there is no relaxation of the fluctuations toward equilibrium for the @xmath95 component due to the conservation law ; higher fourier components decay exponentially wih the rate @xmath96 .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath87 is determined by the rapidity transfer in particle collisions and the average time between collisions : @xmath97 . with some additional simplifying assumptions",
    "one then finds that the mean square fluctuation @xmath98 in a rapidity interval @xmath64 decays according to @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a universal function . for large times",
    ", @xmath98 decays slowly toward its equilibrium value .",
    "@xmath101 describes the minimal rapidity interval for which initial state fluctuations survive .",
    "shuryak and stephanov obtained the estimates @xcite @xmath102 for the rapidity intervals controlling charge and baryon number fluctuations , respectively .",
    "however , these estimates are based on collision rates deduced from a hadronic cascade model ( rqmd ) that does not include a deconfined phase , thus possibly overestimating the size of the required rapidity windows .",
    "for the net charge fluctuations , an elegant way to eliminate the size of the observed volume is to consider the fluctuations in the quantity @xmath103 .",
    "these can be related to the net charge fluctuations by means of the relation @xcite @xmath104 it is useful to correct the quantity @xmath105 for two trivial effects by defining a variable @xmath106 as @xcite @xmath107 with @xmath108 accounting for the net average charge in the rapidity interval ( due to the baryon excess ) and @xmath109 correcting for the effect of global charge conservation . for an uncorrelated thermal pion gas one",
    "expects @xmath110 .",
    "decays of higher meson resonances ( such as @xmath111 ) reduce the value of @xmath106 by about 30% . for a weakly interacting qgp one",

    "a value slightly in excess of @xmath110 was found for all three beam energies and independent of the selected pseudorapidity interval @xmath113 .",
    "the star collaboration has reported first results for net charge fluctuations in au+au collisions at @xmath114 gev in the pseudorapidity window @xmath115 .",
    "the value obtained by star is @xmath116 , as expected for a nearly baryon - free hadron resonance gas @xcite .",
    "fluctuations are sensitive probes of the microscopic structure of dense matter .",
    "local temperature fluctuations can indicate the presence of a second - order phase transition or critical point , while net charge and baryon number fluctuations provide information about the particle modes that govern the charge and baryon number transport . in all cases ,",
    "the rapid expansion of the fireball in its last stages is essential for the survival of fluctuations established at early times .",
    "in addition to thermal fluctuations , the fireball may exhibit fluctuations due to the initial state @xcite .",
    "these could be probed independently in p+p or p+a collisions .",
    "for example , such fluctuations may be probes of the quasiclassical coherent glue fields in a fast - moving nucleus @xcite .",
    "similarly , large nonstatistical fluctuations , such as disoriented chiral condensates , can signal the presence of unstable collective modes at some time during the course of the heavy ion collision .",
    "preliminary data from the na49 and star experiments indicate the presence of both , nontrivial @xmath24 fluctuations near central rapidity and net charge fluctuations similar to those of a pion or hadron resonance gas .",
    "the measurement of net baryon number fluctuations remains a formidable experimental challenge , since they require the detection of neutral as well as charged baryons .",
    "however , the case may not be entirely hopeless , as plans by the phenix collaboration to measure antineutrons with high efficiency demonstrate @xcite .",
    "fluctuations are a rich topic with many theoretical challenges and opportunities .",
    "lattice gauge theory can make quantitative predictions for fluctuations near thermal equilibrium .",
    "the wide array of possible fluctuation observables remains largely unexplored .",
    "microscopic models can simulate final state effects on fluctuations and provide useful guidance about which observables contain valuable information .",
    "there is ample room for the exploration of novel analysis strategies , as our picture of the space - time evolution of nuclear collisions at rhic energy comes into focus .",
    "one especially promising class of observables are the _ balance functions _ , which can provide a more differential measure of quantum number fluctuations in phase space @xcite .",
