    "all stars of initial mass greater than about @xmath0 end violently when their cores collapse ; many or all of these produce supernova explosions .",
    "supernovae are of paramount importance to the evolution of galaxies : they form new elements and recycle the products of stellar evolution .",
    "their energy is converted into motion and heat , affecting the dynamical state of the surrounding gas ; indeed , they are responsible for much of the hot , x - ray emitting gas in galaxies , and for the formation of superbubbles and outflow in starburst galaxies .",
    "observationally , supernovae provide a natural laboratory in which to test theories of stellar evolution and of the circumstellar environments of massive stars : supernova 1987a is a notable example ( @xcite ) .    how does the stellar structure of a progenitor affect the aftermath of its explosion ? the observable properties of a core - collapse supernova are determined by the distribution of material and temperature in its freely - expanding ejecta . the supernova s optical display begins with a photospheric stage , in which a recombination front moves inward through the expanding ejecta .",
    "this process is pre - determined by the temperature , density and opacity profiles of the outcast material . at some point ,",
    "the energy from radioactive decays begins to dominate the light curve .",
    "the nebular display is determined by the distributions of both decaying isotopes and gamma - ray opacity .",
    "later , as the ejecta collide with circumstellar or interstellar material , two shocks are born at the interface : a forward shock accelerating the surrounding material , and a reverse shock decelerating the ejecta ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this interaction depends critically on the distributions of ejected and ambient material .",
    "it is responsible for the appearance of the supernova in the radio , x - ray and infrared bands for centuries after the explosion .",
    "the distributions that characterize a supernova s ejecta are , in turn , determined uniquely by the structure of the progenitor star ( although the distribution of radioactive elements is an added complication ) .",
    "the relation between progenitor and ejecta is established by the hydrodynamics of the supernova explosion itself , which occurs in three stages . in the first stage",
    ", a shock propagates through the stellar material to be ejected , pressurizing it and setting it into motion : we call this the _ blastwave _ stage , following chevalier ( 1976 ) .",
    "once the shock arrives at the stellar surface , a _",
    "phase begins : the material accelerates as its heat is converted into kinetic energy .",
    "this stage ( the most difficult to model ) ends when acceleration ceases , once the ejecta s pressure is too slight to be dynamically important . in the _ ejecta _ stage ,",
    "the outcast material was coasts into homologous expansion , with a velocity distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the correspondence between progenitor and ejecta can be established numerically on a case - by - case basis .",
    "this approach has been pursued for many years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , many aspects of the late stages of stellar evolution are uncertain , including rotation and pulsations ( heger et al .",
    "1997 ) , nuclear reaction rates , mass loss prescriptions and models for semiconvection ( @xcite ) , and it is likely that interactions with stellar ( e.g. , nomoto , iwamoto , & suzuki 1995 ) or substellar companions will affect supernova progenitors .",
    "numerical simulations may describe specific cases quite accurately , but only limited insight into the physical relationship between progenitor and ejecta can be derived from an individual case .",
    "supernova progenitors and their ejecta display strikingly similar features , when the initial and final densities are considered functions of a lagrangian variable , like the enclosed mass . does this imply that there is a simple relationship between the two ?",
    "this paper will investigate the existence of such a relationship , that is , the degree to which the variables that describe a mass shell in the progenitor control its properties after the explosion happens .",
    "a local relation between the initial and final variables implies that the physics of the explosion can be understood in simple terms , despite the complicated hydrodynamical interactions involved .",
    "the pressure - based models of  [ s : pressuremodels ] demonstrate that this is the case .",
    "another goal of this paper will be to provide simple models for broad classes of supernova progenitors , like red supergiants .",
    "when progenitor stars are similar in structure , their ejecta will also take similar distributions . a simple model that can reproduce these ejecta accurately enough to show the differences between them , like the harmonic - mean models of  [ ss : harmrsgs ] , should prove valuable for studies of supernova light curves and circumstellar interactions .",
    "the analytical study of supernova hydrodynamics has relied on familiar self - similar analogs . over a considerable fraction of the progenitor ,",
    "the density distribution resembles a power law in radius : @xmath2 with @xmath3 above the core , but usually with a shallower distribution further out . in a strictly power law ,",
    "spherical distribution , the blastwave stage takes the self - similar form given by taylor ( 1950 ) and sedov ( 1959 ) . chevalier ( 1976 )",
    "likened the structure of a blastwave in an increasingly steep density distribution to a progression of sedov blastwaves in different power law media , and concluded that a detached shell ( density maximum ) would occur if density became steeper than a critical value .",
    "by analogy to the sedov blastwave with @xmath4 , bethe & pizzochero ( 1990 ) conjectured that the shock in supernova 1987a would have nearly a constant velocity .",
    "chevalier & soker ( 1989 ) approximated the central progenitor distribution as @xmath5 , which produces a particularly simple blastwave distribution ( the primakoff - sedov form ) in which density and pressure are power laws in radius and time .",
    "the resemblance to a sedov blastwave must break down as the shock approaches and emerges from the stellar surface , and the rarefaction phase begins .",
    "but there is an analytical solution to guide the understanding of this process as well .",
    "the density varies as a power of depth in the outer layers of a star , and radial curvature can be neglected near enough to the stellar surface .",
    "a planar version of this problem was initially considered by gandelman & frank - kamenetsky ( 1956 ) and solved by sakurai ( 1960 ) . in this context",
    ", the shock front accelerates as it runs down the declining density gradient , and material expands into vacuum after the shock emerges from the surface .",
    "the ratio of final to postshock velocity is the same for all fluid elements in this solution ; the density and pressure approach steep power laws in velocity as the material expands freely .",
    "this solution has been applied to the pulse of emission associated with shock breakout and the early phase of the light curve ( @xcite ) , as well as the distribution of high - velocity ejecta from the explosion ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "imshennik & nadzhin ( 1989 ) and chevalier ( 1992 ) showed that spherical curvature should complicate matters , because a mass shell in the planar solution must travel a long way ( compared to its initial depth ) to reach its final velocity .",
    "kazhdan & murzina ( 1992 ) took the dynamical effect of sphericity into account in a first - order perturbation analysis of sakurai s solution . in this paper",
    ", we will find the correction of the planar solution to higher order by a different method .",
    "sakurai s planar solution describes the end of shock motion and the beginning of rarefaction .",
    "but even with the first - order effect of sphericity accounted for , this solution only holds for the highest - velocity ejecta , or for the brief period in which the shock crosses and ejects a thin outer shell .",
    "it does not describe how this brief period joins onto the blastwave phase that preceded it and the rarefaction phase that follows it , in which the bulk of the ejecta approaches its final velocity .",
    "the rarefaction phase is very complicated in general , even if the blastwave was one of the sedov forms ; rarefaction is therefore a formidable problem .",
    "there is one counter - example .",
    "for the special case of the primakoff blastwave , in which density and sound speed are power laws of radius and time , a rarefaction wave will travel along a power law trajectory .",
    "chevalier & soker ( 1989 ) , using the primakoff form to approximate the blastwave in sn1987a , argued that the spherical rarefaction process will be self - similar in this case .",
    "then , the ratio between the final velocity and the velocity at the rarefaction wave should be the same for any mass shell .",
    "this simple argument specifies that the density should settle into a shallow power law of velocity , in the inner region of the ejecta . joining this shallow inner power law with the steep outer power law specified by sakurai s planar solution , and imposing overall",
    "mass and energy conservation , chevalier & soker found the velocity of the break between the two behaviors .",
    "although it is based on idealizations of the flow , this model compares admirably with simulations involving blue supergiant progenitors .      in this paper",
    "we address each stage of the expulsion of stellar envelopes in core collapse supernovae , in order to arrive at a reliable model for the final ejecta distribution that can accommodate possible variations in progenitors stellar structures . wherever possible , we make use of scaling relations to simplify the problem . when considering red supergiants we concentrate primarily on the outermost composition layer ( the hydrogen envelope ) where our models will be most accurate , approximating these envelopes as polytropes when it is useful to do so .",
    "table [ t : models ] gives an overview of the models developed in this paper ; these are motivated by and then checked against simulations for which the initial configuration is the result of a stellar evolution study .",
    "these progenitors were kindly supplied to us by stan woosley and kenichi nomoto .",
    "we begin by examining in  [ s : scaling ] the scaling relations that connect the hydrodynamical behavior of similar initial structures , under the idealization of adiabatic flow .",
    "the scaling to similar solutions will be especially useful in  [ s : highv ] , where we present solutions for the high - velocity ejecta of convective and radiative envelopes with a single form for each .",
    "section [ s : progenitors ] discusses the general features of supernova progenitor stellar structures .",
    "these are marked by composition zones of vastly different density and radial scale .",
    "the blastwave shock typically decelerates inside each layer , and accelerates in the steep density declines between zones .",
    "the shock wave accelerates as it approaches the surface of the star , at the end of the blastwave phase .",
    "the models we develop will require an approximation for the detailed motion of the blastwave shock front .",
    "the forward shock defines the outer boundary of the flow in the blastwave stage .",
    "moreover , the blastwave shock velocity sets the entropy distribution for the ensuing adiabatic flow ( for material not subject to reverse shocks ) .",
    "the shock velocity thereby affects the rarefaction phase as well , and the relation between pressure and density in the final ejecta phase .",
    "the shock velocity is also necessary to set the coefficients of the power laws that describe the highest - velocity ejecta . in reality , the shock velocity must be determined self - consistently by matching it to the postshock pressure in the blastwave phase .",
    "previous studies ( kompaneets 1960 , laumbach & probstein 1969 , whitham 1974 , klimishin & gnatyk 1982 , koo & mckee 1990 ) have suggested a number of formulae for the velocities of shocks in inhomogeneous , three - dimensional distributions ; all of these formulae have drawbacks in the context of supernovae , and we will suggest another simple shock velocity formula better adapted to this context in  [ s : vshock ] .",
    "this shock velocity approximation is the product of well - known scaling laws for spherical decelerating shocks and planar accelerating shocks . despite its simplicity",
    ", this approximation tracks the successive periods of shock acceleration and deceleration with remarkable accuracy .",
    "this approximation gives the entropy distribution in the ejecta , except where a reverse shock interferes .",
    "it also gives the coefficients that describe the highest - velocity ejecta .    in  [",
    "s : highv ] we address the dynamics of material near the surface in the progenitor , the material that is ejected at high velocity .",
    "the initial distribution of this material , described in  [ ss : rho01 ] , has a predictable form in radiative and polytropic envelopes . having a reliable estimate of the velocity of the shock that launches this material , we calculate in  [ ss : ssresults ] the coefficients of the power laws that describe its ejecta , as given by the planar , self - similar solution ( gandelman & frank - kamenetsky 1956 , sakurai 1960 ; see the appendix ) . most material attains a smaller velocity than the planar formula would give , because spherical expansion reduces the pressure below its planar value .",
    "this is a geometrical effect , however , and because the initial density distributions of this material are similar among broad classes of envelopes ( radiative or convective ) , the final ejecta distributions are also similar . in ",
    "[ ss : commonform ] , we present simple formulae that capture the deviation of important quantities away from their self - similar power laws .    the self - similar solutions that give power laws for the high - velocity ejecta are not valid to infinite velocity , of course . the assumption of adiabatic flow breaks down for material involved in shock breakout , because radiation diffuses or streams out of the gas .",
    "this process also produces a burst of soft x - rays . in ",
    "[ sss : speedlimit ] we present formulae for the upper velocity limit for adiabatic flow .",
    "we use our non - relativistic analysis to derive an approximate criterion for relativistic mass ejection and the rest mass of relativistic ejecta ( if any ) in  [ sss : relativity ] . in  [ sss : emergence ] , we present formulae for the characteristics of the x - ray burst .",
    "although previous authors have treated the radiation outburst in a similar manner ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the shock velocity formula of  [ s : vshock ] allows us to elucidate the effects of stellar structure on the outburst .",
    "the results of  [ s : highv ] apply to the high - velocity ejecta , those at velocities a few times greater than the systemic velocity .",
    "however , little of the mass or energy in the ejecta lies in this velocity range . for the bulk of ejecta , the details of the progenitor s structure break the scaling relations that allow the high - velocity ejecta to be given accurately by simple formulae .",
    "we note that the final _ pressure _ distribution is always smooth and continuous in the ejecta , even if the density distribution is not . for this reason ,",
    "we base our models for the entire ejecta distribution , discussed in  [ s : pressuremodels ] , on models for the pressure distribution that mimic the smooth pressure functions seen in simulations .",
    "we find a simple way to extend the pressure distributions derived in  [ ss : commonform ] inward in mass .",
    "the final density distribution is specified by the combination of this pressure model with the entropy left behind in the shock .",
    "these pressure - based models constitute a _",
    "local _ theory , in that they relate the final density of a mass shell with its initial state .",
    "these models fail in regions that are traversed by a strong reverse shock , because we do not account for the entropy it deposits ; this failure is worst in the inner composition layers of red supergiants .",
    "even so , there is a jump in density between the ejected helium mantle and the ejected hydrogen envelope that is not affected by the reverse shock ; a simple analysis of this phenomenon is presented in ",
    "[ ss : rhojump ] .    section [ ss : harmrsgs ] presents a different type of model for ejecta distributions , in which the shape of the final density is described as a simple , harmonic - mean interpolation between two power laws of velocity .",
    "this is a _",
    "global _ model , since it gives an ejecta distribution ( in terms of three free parameters ) without referring to the detailed structure of the progenitor . for blue supergiants",
    ", we adopt the theory of chevalier & soker ( 1989 ) to motivate the choice of parameters . for red supergiants , we find that the harmonic - mean model can fit the ejected hydrogen quite accurately , but it does not fit the ejected mantle because of the density jump between the two regions .    in  [ s : rsgs ]",
    "we develop simplified polytropic models for red supergiant progenitors of type ii supernovae .",
    "we argue that these can be adequately described by two parameters that are ratios of masses in the progenitor . moreover , these mass ratios are tightly correlated , so that there is essentially a one - parameter family of red supergiant progenitors .",
    "we investigate this family of models numerically to find the distribution of the free parameter used in the pressure - based model of  [ s : pressuremodels ] and the three free parameters in the harmonic - mean models of  [ ss : harmrsgs ] ; results are given in table [ t : harmonics ] .",
    "section [ s : simcomp ] contains a comparison between our models and the ejecta of simulated supernovae whose progenitors are the end products of stellar evolution calculations .",
    "this comparison allows a tabulation of the errors introduced in the pressure - based and harmonic - mean models ( table [ t : errors ] ) in a realistic context .",
    "the models developed in this paper help to explain many of the features seen in numerical simulations of supernovae .",
    "this is true even for features are not reproduced accurately by the models , those caused by reverse shocks or by variations in the polytropic index at the outside of the progenitor .",
    "these features are discussed in  [ s : simcomp ] and in the conclusions .    in the appendix",
    ", we develop a fully lagrangian treatment of the self - similar shock acceleration problem solved by sakurai .",
    "this problem has previously been addressed in two steps , with an eulerian solution prior to emergence matched to a lagrangian description of the subsequent expansion .",
    "the fully lagrangian description facilitates analyses of the highest - velocity material .",
    "we use it to compare our results of  [ ss : commonform ] to the suggestion of litvinova & nadzhin ( 1990 ) that spherical expansion essentially truncates planar , self - similar acceleration , and we find that this happens at about three stellar radii .",
    "although the phenomenon of core collapse is quite complex ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the resulting blastwave in the stellar envelope has relatively simple dynamics .",
    "gravity is relatively insignificant except for the interior layers , which may suffer infall .",
    "the gain or loss of energy to nuclear reactions is also dynamically insignificant except for these inner layers , although they are probably mixed to higher velocities by the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "( heat from decaying @xmath6 may blow bubbles in the ejecta [ arnett , fryxell & mller 1989 ; li , mccray & sunyaev 1993 ] ) .",
    "likewise , neutrino heating is negligible outside the dense circumnuclear material .",
    "the pressure is radiation dominated , and the ratio of radiation to gas pressure remains constant ( for each mass shell ) throughout the period of adiabatic motion .",
    "the radiation diffuses sufficiently little during the period of acceleration that the flow can be modeled as adiabatic , although this approximation fails for the optically thin shell associated with the uv or x - ray flash ( e.g. , ensman & burrows 1992 ) .",
    "the heat lost to radiation never exceeds a few percent of the total explosion energy , implying that radiative transfer can be neglected in general .    under the approximation",
    "that the flow is adiabatic , radiation - dominated and non - gravitating , its only dimensional scales are the explosion energy ( @xmath7 ) , mass ( @xmath8 ) and initial stellar radius ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "explosions with different values for these parameters , but the same initial density profile , are identical after rescaling the hydrodynamic variables by their characteristic values .",
    "common stellar density profiles recur on a variety of scales , and the resulting ( normalized ) ejecta distributions are identical .",
    "we will make use of this principle in ",
    "[ s : highv ] .",
    "we take a mass coordinate @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the mass of the material that will become the remnant ) that is zero at the boundary between ejected and remnant material , and increases to @xmath8 at the exterior .",
    "the configuration of the progenitor is specified by the initial density @xmath12 and the initial radius @xmath13 .",
    "if we normalize to the characteristic scales of mass , radius , velocity , time , density , pressure and entropy , the flow expressed in normalized variables evolves independently of these scales .",
    "the basic characteristic scales are @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 , from which it is useful to derive the following characteristic quantities : @xmath14 we will call the quantity @xmath15 the ` entropy ' ; for @xmath16 , it is proportional to the phase space volume and the photon - baryon ratio .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide formulae for the end product of an adiabatic explosion . in the final state of adiabatic",
    "free expansion , the velocity of a given mass shell is fixed , while its density and pressure fall off as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the ejecta properties scale with the ejected mass , stellar radius and blastwave energy : for a given feature in the ejecta ( the half - mass shell , say ) , @xmath19 these overall scalings are very important for inferring gross quantities , but they say nothing about the relation between the progenitor s structure and the distribution of its ejecta .",
    "so , we are interested here in the normalized ratios @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 as parameterized , for instance , by the normalized mass @xmath23 .",
    "note that these are ` final ' values only in the sense of an adiabatic explosion into vacuum : the radiation pressure will differ from @xmath24 because of radiation diffusion and radioactive decay , and the distribution of matter in the ejecta ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) will ultimately be destroyed as interstellar material is swept up .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the normalized mass coordinate @xmath27 , which varies from 0 to 1 in the ejecta .",
    "because all of the hydrodynamical variables approach power laws in the limit of high velocity , @xmath28 , we introduce a notation that removes this dependence . in this limit ,",
    "a variable @xmath29 varies as @xmath30 for some exponent @xmath31 ; so , we define @xmath32 by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a characteristic value for @xmath29 ( a combination of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath31 and limiting coefficients @xmath35 can be evaluated by combining the initial density and shock velocity in the subsurface layers with results from the planar , self - similar solution for the ejection of this material ; this is done in  [ ss : ssresults ] . unless otherwise noted",
    ", @xmath36 refers to the final value of @xmath29 in free expansion .",
    "so , @xmath37 refers to @xmath38 , whereas @xmath39 refers to @xmath40 , the shock velocity .",
    "the progenitors of core collapse supernovae are stars initially more massive than about @xmath0 , whose cores have advanced though carbon burning . the degenerate iron core approaches the chandrasekhar mass in the subsequent burning stages , the process of ` core convergence ' ( arnett 1997 ) .",
    "this core has the radius and density of an iron white dwarf .",
    "the circumnuclear shells decrease in density away from this core , characteristically as @xmath4 . outside the carbon shell ,",
    "the helium envelope begins .",
    "there is typically a steep , shelf - like decline in the density between the carbon and helium .",
    "the helium envelope is typically radiative prior to the explosion ( @xcite ) .    above the helium envelope",
    "sits whatever hydrogen - rich envelope has survived the stellar mass loss , which may be none at all .",
    "the structure of the star interior to the hydrogen is little altered by its presence or absence , because the hydrogen burning shell has a pressure and temperature that is negligible relative to the interior ( @xcite ) . in stars that have hydrogen ,",
    "the boundary between hydrogen and helium is marked by a density drop even steeper and greater than at the base of the helium envelope .",
    "presupernova stars with radiative hydrogen envelopes are blue supergiants ( bsgs ) ; those with convective hydrogen envelopes are red supergiants ( rsgs ) ; and those with no hydrogen at all are helium or carbon stars .",
    "core - collapse supernovae are classified observationally into types ii , ib , and ic .",
    "type ii supernovae show hydrogen lines , type ib show helium but no hydrogen , and type ic show neither .",
    "because the spectrum may change with time , supernovae can shift in classification ( filippenko 1997 ) : supernova 1993j was one such ( e.g. , shigeyama et al .",
    "thus red and blue supergiants have the capacity to produce types ii and ib , helium stars can produce types ib and ic , and carbon stars can only produce type ic",
    ".    we will concentrate on the topmost stellar envelope , which we will term the _ outer envelope _ and whose mass we designate @xmath41 .",
    "this layer is the hydrogen - rich envelope of those stars that have hydrogen .",
    "those layers that lie interior to the outer envelope , but are also ejected in the explosion , we will refer to as the _ mantle _ , with mass @xmath42 .",
    "the total ejecta mass @xmath43 is the sum of these , @xmath44 . the _ remnant _ , with mass @xmath45 , is the stellar material that is not ejected ; this is slightly greater than the mass of the relict object because of rest energy radiated in the explosion .",
    "the total progenitor mass is @xmath46 .",
    "our focus on the outer envelope is motivated by the observation that it receives the lion s share of the explosion energy ; moreover , our simulations indicate that the distribution of the outer envelope ejecta is determined primarily by its own structure and the mass @xmath42 of the ejecta it overlies , not appreciably by the structure of the underlying mantle material .",
    "convective envelopes , like those in rsgs , can be approximated as @xmath47 polytropes in structure .",
    "this approximation would be exact if the convection were efficient , but the presence of a superadiabatic gradient breaks this idealization at large initial radii ( nomoto & sugimoto 1972 ) .",
    "models of convection can prescribe a superadiabatic gradient , but the results depend on the model used ( mixing length , for instance ) , as well as stellar parameters ( such as @xmath48 )",
    ". we will idealize convective outer envelopes as @xmath47 polytropes , but the reader is advised to keep this caveat in mind .",
    "radiative envelopes of constant ( thomson - dominated ) opacity , such as those in bsgs , limit to an effective polytropic index of @xmath49 toward the outside of the star , because such envelopes behave like @xmath49 polytropes when luminosity and mass are proportional",
    ". however , the interior of blue supergiants is better described by a lower effective polytropic index . in the bsg progenitor of nomoto",
    ", we find that @xmath50 for the inner @xmath51 of the ejected mass , with @xmath52 climbing to @xmath53 in the exterior @xmath54 .",
    "( a power law of index @xmath55 was adopted by @xcite . )",
    "the structure of a polytropic envelope is determined , up to overall scaling factors , by a single parameter , corresponding to the fact that the lane - emden equation reduces to a first - order differential equation in terms of homology - independent variables ( @xcite ) .",
    "which structure is appropriate is determined by the inner boundary condition , defined by the mantle s mass ratio @xmath56 and the radius ratio @xmath57 . in order to get a single parameter from these two , consider that the lane - emden equation describing the outer envelope can be integrated all the way to the center of the star .",
    "this hypothetical integration through the region actually occupied by the mantle will yield a polytrope that behaves as if it lay above a point mass at the origin .",
    "the value of the point mass compared to @xmath58 , which we term @xmath59 , provides a single parameter with which to distinguish outer envelope structures .    to understand the relation between @xmath59 and the more familiar parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ", we must examine the central behavior of polytropes .",
    "polytropes with @xmath62 limit as @xmath63 to the central distribution ( @xcite ) , @xmath64 for some constant @xmath65 ( equality when @xmath66 ) . in red supergiants ( @xmath47 )",
    ", one can typically ignore the envelope mass taken up by the volume of the mantle , both because the mantle radius is very small ( @xmath67 ) , and because the envelope mass is not highly concentrated towards the center ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "so for rsgs , we can use the core - envelope mass ratio to parameterize the envelope structure : @xmath69 in bsgs , an effective value of @xmath59 is less easily determined , because of the variation in the effective polytropic index @xmath52 .",
    "polytropes with @xmath70 extend continuously and smoothly to the origin , where @xmath71 ( because @xmath72 at the center ) . for any value of @xmath59 greater than zero , the central density profile is @xmath73 , as long as @xmath62 ( @xcite ) . in polytropic envelopes that are much more massive than their cores ,",
    "so that @xmath74 , this behavior is limited to a small region around the center ( of similar mass ) , outside of which the structure returns to the flatter , @xmath70 form . on the other hand ,",
    "envelopes with @xmath75 are dominated by the gravity of their cores : the density profile is everywhere at least as steep as the central behavior .",
    "we will be especially interested in the region of a progenitor nearest the surface , because it is in this layer that the shock accelerates and casts away the highest - velocity ejecta .",
    "fortunately , the equations of polytropic stellar structure are simplified for this material . the hydrostatic equation for a polytropic envelope",
    "can be integrated to give : @xmath76 dr^{-1 } }      { \\int_{r_\\star^{-1}}^{r_0^{-1 } } m_\\star dr^{-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in a shallow ( outer ) layer whose mass is negligible compared to @xmath58 , the ratio of mass integrals is approximately unity .",
    "therefore , this region has an analytical density structure : @xmath79 this is valid only for masses such that the enclosed mass can be approximated by @xmath58 ; however , the region of validity may be relatively large in radius . for light envelopes",

    "consider the phase of planar free expansion , when a mass shell has traveled far compared to its initial depth , but only a small distance relative to @xmath9 .",
    "then , because the surface area of a shell is effectively constant , the density scales as @xmath223 $ ] .",
    "since the optical depth @xmath207 of a mass shell does not vary in planar flow , the diffusion time is proportional to the dynamical time during this planar free expansion phase . examining the planar , self - similar solution presented in the appendix",

    "similarly , the shock front itself has a width that is set by the equality of the diffusion time across the front to the time for material to cross the shock front . as a result ,",
    "the criterion for a mass shell to experience significant radiation diffusion during planar expansion is simply that it be entrained in the shock at the time of breakout .",
    "even so , one might still worry that the onset of spherical expansion will permit a diffusion wave to propagate inward . then",
    ", the geometric reduction of a mass shell s velocity would be enhanced ( and the formulae of  [ ss : commonform ] invalidated ) by the loss of photons .",
    "fortunately , this does not happen either .",
    "the results of  [ ss : commonform ] indicate that the geometric effect sets in at the fixed radius @xmath194 .",

    "the extreme difference in density between the mantles and outer envelopes of red supergiants , as well as the relative constancy of the hydrogen envelope density , suggest that simple models can reproduce the dynamics and final density distribution of these stars .",
    "such an approach was taken by chevalier ( 1976 ) , who found that progenitor models with constant - density mantles and constant - density outer envelopes , separated by a region of steep density decline , could reproduce the qualitative features of type ii light curves .",
    "most notably , he identified existence of a plateau phase with the formation of a ` detached shell ' ( density maximum ) in the final distribution .",
    "we will use a different set of simplified models to represent these progenitors , so it is worthwhile to review in detail why such models are realistic .    in red supergiants",
    ", the outer convective envelope can be modeled as a polytrope of index @xmath47 (  [ s : progenitors ] ) , so that the shape of its density distribution is determined by the ratio of its mass to that of the star , @xmath313 .",
    "clearly , the initial distribution of density in the progenitor will affect the final distribution of ejecta in the ejecta .",
    "there is one other parameter that plays an important role in determining the ejecta distributions from the convective outer envelopes of red supergiants : @xmath314 , the ratio of the outer envelope s mass to the total ejected mass .",
    "this ratio determines how much material ( beneath the outer envelope ) participates in the explosion .",
    "although the outer envelope will wind up with the lion s share of the final kinetic energy , the mass of underlying ejected mantle is important in the blastwave stage . at the beginning of this phase ,",
    "the explosion energy is contained within the mantle . during the course of the blastwave ,",
    "as the explosion energy gets transferred to the outer envelope , the mass of the swept - up mantle material continues to affect the forward shock velocity ( eq . [ eq : vshock ] ) .",
    "note that the shock velocity in the outer envelope ( as approximated by equation [ [ s : vshock ] ] ) is affected by the _ mass _ of the mantle , but not ( to the accuracy of this approximation ) by its structure . indeed , there is reason to believe that this property should hold for the final ejecta distribution as well .",
    "our pressure - based model for the ejecta is a local theory , making reference to the initial variables @xmath147 in the progenitor .",
    "the distinction between remnant and mantle affects the mass coordinate @xmath137 , so the mass ratio @xmath314 affects our prediction for the outer envelope ejecta .",

    "so , we are justified in using simplified models whose mantles have a realistic mass but an idealized structure .",

    "only certain values of these two parameters are realistic , as depicted by figure [ fig : paramfig ] .",
    "although the loss of the outer envelope mass in isolated stars and binaries is uncertain and intrinsically variable , the evolution of stellar cores and mantles appears to be nearly independent of mass loss and initial metallicity while a hydrogen envelope persists ( @xcite , @xcite ) . assuming that the fiducial estimate of the remnant mass is correct , this implies that @xmath45 and @xmath42 are well known as a function of initial stellar mass .",
    "the final value of the hydrogen envelope mass @xmath317 depends on uncertain mass loss , but it is unlikely that the final stellar mass @xmath58 of an rsg will exceed the initial main - sequence mass , except perhaps in some massive binaries . the circles in figure [ fig : paramfig ] demonstrate the locus of the two parameters for stars that lose no mass ; the stars on this line are the models of maeder ( 1992 ) , which also agree with those of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and show no significant variation with metallicity . varying @xmath317 between this maximum amount and zero , a star with a certain ratio @xmath318 will trace out a curve ( shown as dotted lines ) in the space of these parameters . as discussed by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the mass loss rate of isolated stars increases with metallicity .",
    "their calculated final states of solar - metallicity stars are shown as stars in the figure .",
    "it is evident from this figure that only a narrow swath of the parameter space of @xmath59 and @xmath314 is likely to be inhabited by type ii supernova progenitors .",

    "this comparison was made before the passage of a reverse shock , for zones that experienced one .",
    "a slight loss of entropy conservation ( decreasing with increasing resolution ) was observed in the range of @xmath332 breakout times , and we were careful to record the shock - deposited entropy of all zones by the time of breakout .",
    "we have compared in detail both the pressure - based and the harmonic - mean models for the final density distribution @xmath333 against the output of the hydrodynamic code for the case of two progenitor distributions : a @xmath334 red supergiant progenitor ( woosley & weaver 1995 , courtesy of s. e. woosley ) , and a @xmath335 progenitor for supernova 1987a ( shigeyama & nomoto 1990 , courtesy of k. nomoto ) .",

    "the density then declines towards the surface , but shallows out again , with @xmath342 decreasing from @xmath343 to @xmath344 . the reverse shock into the he mantle stalls after it has traversed a mass comparable to the envelope mass , leaving behind a jump in density .",
    "the shallow initial density law leads to steeply declining final density in the outermost hydrogen ejecta , as predicted by equation ( [ eq : lrho2lp2 ] ) and depicted by suzuki & nomoto ( 1995 ) . the density jump and the variations of outer power law",
    "were not reproduced by our pressure - based or harmonic - mean models , although the helium mantle ejecta was fairly well represented .",
    "in this paper we develop analytical approximations that capture the essential elements of spherically symmetric , adiabatic explosions in media of finite mass and extremely stratified density distributions : the progenitors of supernovae .",
    "analytical predictions are motivated and then calibrated by comparison to numerical simulations for realistic red and blue supergiant progenitors . in separate sections",
    "we address the velocity law of supernova shock waves (  [ s : vshock ] ) , the expansion of the highest - velocity ejecta (  [ s : highv ] ) , and two types of models for the final distribution of ejecta .",
    "one of these models (  [ s : pressuremodels ] ) specifies the pressure distribution in the ejecta , and derives the final density distribution ; the other (  [ ss : harmrsgs ] ) specifies the density directly as a function of final velocity .",
    "the benefits and drawbacks of these models , in application to red and blue supergiants , are summarized in table [ t : models ] .",
    "we emphasize the structure of the outer ( typically hydrogen ) envelope ejecta in particular , because this layer is separated from the underlying mantle material by a large drop in initial density .",
    "this drop in density leads to an acceleration of the forward shock , followed by a reverse shock into the mantle material as the forward shock decelerates .",
    "although our models can account for the density jump in the ejecta caused by the acceleration of the forward shock (  [ ss : rhojump ] ) , we make no attempt to model reverse shock propagation .",
    "so , our models do not describe the mantle material accurately , although this drawback is much less severe for blue supergiants than for red ones .",
    "no doubt the most useful conclusion of this work is that the ejecta distributions from red supergiants are described by the single parameter @xmath345 .",
    "this simplification occurs because these progenitors follow a sequence in parameter space ( the dashed line in figure [ fig : paramfig ] ) as they lose mass , regardless of the mechanism of stellar mass loss .",
    "when these stars explode , their ejected hydrogen envelopes assume a distribution that can be fit reliably by the simple , harmonic - mean models of  [ ss : harmrsgs ] .",
    "the sequence of progenitors produces a sequence of ejecta distributions ( with fits tabulated in table [ t : harmonics ] ) .",
    "the simplicity of these harmonic - mean models makes them ideal for a systematic analysis of type ii supernova light curves from rsgs .",
    "such an analysis would be useful in calibrating the expanding photospheres method , as discussed by eastman , schmidt and kirshner ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , this work is limited by the assumption of strict spherical symmetry in the analytical models and in the numerical simulations against which they are compared .",
    "the oblateness of a rotating progenitor ( chevalier & soker 1989 ) , the instability of accelerating shock waves ( albeit slowly growing ; chevalier 1990 , luo & chevalier 1994 ) and the rayleigh - taylor instability ( e.g. , herant & woosley 1994 ) have interesting effects that are not accounted for here .",
    "moreover , by approximating supernovae as adiabatic , non - gravitating point explosions we have neglected physics that is important for the inner mantle material ( where reverse shocks also limit our accuracy ) .    our model for the shock velocity ( eq . [ [ eq : vshock ] ] )",
    "is the simplest possible formula that combines powers of the local variables @xmath137 , @xmath98 and @xmath86 in the progenitor and the blastwave energy @xmath7 in a manner consistent with both spherical and planar scaling laws , without introducing dimensional scales .",
    "the success ( figure [ fig : vshock ] ) of this formula implies that blastwave shocks are controlled primarily by these scalings , even in situations where the postshock flow is quite complicated , including , at times , reverse shocks .",
    "this is very convenient , because it allows an accurate estimation of the entropy distribution deposited by this forward shock ( although the entropy from a reverse shock is not accounted for ) . an accurate prediction of the shock velocity and its dependence on the stellar structure also permits a systematic analysis of the dynamics of the high - velocity ejecta (  [ s : highv ] ) , including the maximum velocity achieved by the ejecta (  [ ss : vlimit ] ) and an analysis of the burst of radiation that occurs at shock breakout (  [ sss : emergence ] ) .",
    "we find in  [ sss : relativity ] that a star must be sufficiently compact in order to produce any relativistic ejecta ; for such stars , we make a rough estimate of the rest mass of relativistic ejecta . applying these considerations to the supernova 1998bw and the gamma - ray burst , grb 9804025 , that may be associated with it ( soffita et al .",
    "1998 ) , we find that an explosion of relatively small ejected masses ( @xmath249 ) and large energy ( @xmath346 ergs ) could provide enough energy in relativistic ejecta both for the gamma - ray burst ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , and to power the inferred relativistically expanding synchrotron shell ( kulkarni et al .",
    "woosley et al . ( 1998 ) considered models for sn1998bw with larger ejected masses in order to fit the supernova light curve , and found accordingly smaller energies in the relativistic ejecta . even assuming the existence of this ejecta",
    ", liberating its energy in a brief period requires an unusually high circumstellar density , as woosley et al .",
    "point out .",
    "the velocity at which stellar material expands into space is related to the velocity of the shock front that set it into motion .",
    "however , the nature of this relationship is very different for material deep in the ejected envelope than for material near the stellar surface .",
    "simple considerations (  [ s : highv ] ) reveal that the highest - velocity ( initially outermost ) material is cast away at some multiple of the shock velocity that traversed it , although the value of this factor varies with initial depth . at lower velocities",
    ", the smoothness of the pressure distribution controls the density distribution of the ejecta from deep within the progenitor . here",
    "the shock velocity determines the final velocity indirectly , by means of the entropy distribution .",
    "the transition between these two behaviors is the result of a complicated , spherical rarefaction flow .",
    "but , simple models for the pressure distribution (  [ s : pressuremodels ] ) reproduce this transition quite accurately , especially in polytropic progenitors for which the high - velocity behavior is well understood (  [ ss : commonform ] ) .",
    "features in the ejecta at low velocities , most notably the structure of the ejected mantle , can be understood on the basis of approximate pressure equilibrium .",
    "one consequence of pressure equilibrium for the low - velocity ejecta is the presence a sharp density jump at the base of the outer envelope : the helium ejecta is denser and has a lower entropy than the hydrogen ejecta that surrounds it .",
    "this jump , quantified in  [ ss : rhojump ] , is greater in the ejecta from red supergiants ( about a factor of @xmath347 ) than from blue supergiants ( about a factor of three ) .",
    "it results directly from the density difference between envelopes in a progenitor , and the shock acceleration that occurs there .",
    "as we have discussed , this feature is unlikely to be affected by the development of reverse shocks or the rayleigh - taylor instability , and may have interesting observational implications in the epoch of recombination .",
    "the much larger drop in density from helium to hydrogen between red and blue supergiants also leads to a much stronger reverse shock in rsgs than in bsgs .",
    "this limits the accuracy of our pressure - based models , which do not include the entropy deposited in the helium mantles ( particularly in rsg mantles ) by the reverse shock .",
    "it also has important consequences for the velocity of radioactive material in the ejecta .",
    "consider , for instance , the fate of the innermost @xmath348 of ejecta in the @xmath334 rsg and the @xmath335 bsg progenitors depicted in figures [ fig : pressurefigrsg ] and [ fig : pressurefigbsg ] . in the numerical simulations , which include reverse shocks",
    ", this half solar mass is one to three times more dense at a given time in the rsg ejecta than in the bsg ejecta ( the comparison is straightforward , since the ejected masses are quite similar ) . because the outer envelope harbors almost all of the energy in the final state , its expansion velocity is essentially fixed .",
    "so , the expansion velocity of the mantle is determined by its density relative to the outer envelope , which depends on the difference in entropy between the two regions .",
    "this , in turn , is affected by the reverse shock .",
    "our pressure - based models indicate what might happen if the reverse shock never developed , and the mantle were decelerated by a compression wave instead : it would then lack the reverse shock entropy , and be much denser ( and expanding slower ) in comparison to the outer envelope . although these concepts are the products of spherically - symmetric models , similar considerations should apply in realistic explosions as well .",
    "it is noteworthy that the reverse shock develops inward ( in mass ) from the density jump between the helium and hydrogen ejecta , so that there is a density peak at the outer helium ejecta in red supergiants ( figure [ fig : pressurefigrsg ] ) .    in bsgs",
    "the reverse shock is much less severe than for rsgs , and ( at least for the model @xmath349 bsg provided by nomoto ) seems to develop far inward in mass from the hydrogen - helium boundary .",
    "the pressure - based model tracks the mantle ejecta quite well .",
    "indeed , the difference between the mantle and the outer envelope can be ignored entirely without too much error : such is the spirit of the chevalier & soker ( 1989 ) model for sn1987a , whose elements we have incorporated into our harmonic - mean model for bsgs . here",
    ", the mantle and the inner region of the hydrogen ejecta can be grouped together as a single region of gently declining density .",
    "regardless of the mantle , it appears that the ejecta density distribution in the bulk of the hydrogen envelope is a flat or gently declining function of velocity ( or mass ) for both red and blue supergiants . at some break velocity ,",
    "the structure of @xmath350 rolls over toward the steeply declining power law it must assume at high velocities . for red supergiants , a quantitative statement can be made : density falls by only a factor of @xmath351 in the inner half of the hydrogen ejecta mass .",
    "( this density drop decreases with increasing mass ratio @xmath59 , despite the fact that the inner power law @xmath352 gets steeper [ table [ t : harmonics ] ] , but note that the hydrogen envelope is a smaller fraction of the ejecta as @xmath59 increases . )    chevalier ( 1976 ) , making an analogy with sedov blastwaves of different indices , suggested that a detached shell ( density maximum ) should form in the ejecta at shells for which @xmath353 decreases smoothly through the value @xmath354 in the progenitor .",
    "if this were strictly true , a detached shell would form in the outer envelope ejecta of all the progenitors we have considered .",
    "no such density maxima actually formed in the outer envelopes , although density maxima did occur in the ejected mantles ( of rsgs especially , as described above ) .",
    "the presence of density maxima in the ejected mantles depends on the strength of the reverse shock , and does not appear to be related to chevalier s proposed mechanism .",
    "it is clear from our simulations that when a progenitor deviates from a polytropic structure in the outer half of its radius , perhaps because of inefficient convection or the details of radiative transfer , the resulting high - velocity ejecta distribution bears the imprint of this effect .",
    "this is apparent when the ejecta from simulations with realistic stellar progenitors are compared against the ejecta of polytropic models .",
    "our analysis of the high - velocity ejecta of polytropic models is limited in applicability by this effect . on the other hand , the relative constancy of the shock velocity parameter @xmath131 ,",
    "the postshock acceleration ratio @xmath170 , and the truncation radius @xmath355 for planar acceleration all suggest that it may be possible to extend our semi - analytical theory to accommodate variations in @xmath52 .",
    "with such a theory , it may even be possible to constrain models of inefficient convection with the early light curves of type ii supernovae .",
    "our pressure - based model , being derived from a simple model for the entropy deposited in the blastwave shock , is a _ local _ theory that relates the final density @xmath356 of a mass shell with its initial density @xmath86 , initial radius @xmath98 , and enclosed ejected mass @xmath137 . a strong reverse shock ,",
    "whose passage can not be predicted by these local variables alone , invalidates this model in the mantles of stars .",
    "but , the local theory is exceptionally accurate where it is valid .",
    "our harmonic - mean models , on the other hand , are _ global _ models for the ejecta distributions of supernovae , in the sense that they specify the general run of final density versus velocity that results from a specific type of progenitor structure .",
    "these models are appealing for their simplicity , although they contain little information about the dynamics of envelope expulsion in supernovae .",
    "the authors are indebted to stan woosley and kenichi nomoto for providing supernova progenitor structures , and to j. kelly truelove for providing the computer code that we modified for the purposes of this paper .",
    "cdm thanks john monnier , ben metcalf and george mclean for many valuable suggestions , lars bildsten for clarifying stellar structure and evolution and reviewing a draft of this work , and douglas leonard for discussing light curves .",
    "we also wish to thank our referee , roger chevalier , for insightful and helpful comments .",
    "cdm was supported in part by a national science foundation graduate fellowship and an arcs fellowship .",
    "the research of both cdm and cfm is supported in part by the national science foundation through nsf grant ast 95 - 30480 .",
    "we present a calculation of the self - similar , planar flow in a power law density distribution with an edge , the problem posed by gandelman & frank - kamenetsky ( 1956 ) and solved by sakurai ( 1960 ) .",
    "unlike previous treatments , we use a lagrangian approach for the pre - breakout flow as well as the post - breakout flow .",
    "this has the advantage that variables can be compared against their postshock values , rather than against their breakout values ( which previously were related to postshock values with an eulerian treatment ) . to do this",
    ", we first define the space and time coordinates @xmath357 and @xmath358 .",
    "the time at which a mass shell experiences the shock is @xmath359 . for our self - similar",
    "coordinate we choose @xmath360 , and for the flow variable we choose @xmath361 .",
    "our variables @xmath362 and @xmath363 are both unity in the initial state , and decrease toward @xmath364 as the flow progresses .",
    "breakout occurs when @xmath365 .",
    "considering the time variable @xmath370 to be parameterized by @xmath362 and @xmath162 , the constraint of constant time , @xmath371 , gives @xmath372 .",
    "this relation allows us to take the necessary derivatives to solve for the flow .",
    "first of these is the density , defined in planar geometry by : @xmath373 now , we evaluate the pressure as @xmath374 , where @xmath375 and @xmath376 are the postshock pressure and density .",
    "the acceleration in planar geometry is , @xmath377 @xmath378 . from the definitions of @xmath363 and @xmath362 , on the other hand , @xmath379 . combining the two expressions for the acceleration , we have the following differential equation for @xmath363 to describe planar , self - similar flow : @xmath380^\\gamma } -\\gamma ( \\lambda-1 ) \\eta \\frac{\\lambda",

    "we used the technique described by sakurai to determine @xmath385 ( or equivalently @xmath131 ) for @xmath16 and @xmath47 and 3 .",
    "then we solved for the evolution of a mass shell s position using equation ( [ eq : selfsimeqn ] ) , starting with the initial conditions of equation ( [ eq : selfsiminit ] ) .",
    "we continued the numerical solution out to @xmath386 , and used the known asymptotic solution to find the limit @xmath387 . for the purpose of studying the solution",
    ", we then fit the resulting velocity history @xmath383 in powers of @xmath388 .",
    "this parameterization was chosen to show the asymptotic dependence of @xmath363 as @xmath389 , and also to be finite for all @xmath390 .",
    "we obtain , @xmath391 these fits , meant to capture the late - time evolution accurately , are accurate to within @xmath392 and @xmath393 , respectively , for @xmath394 , although they miss the breakout value ( @xmath395 ) by @xmath396 and @xmath397 , respectively . for the purpose of studying the truncation of the self - similar acceleration law , as discussed in  [ s : highv ] , it is useful to make similar fits based on the normalized distance coordinate @xmath398 rather than the time coordinate @xmath362 : @xmath399 much like the previous fits , these are both valid to within @xmath400 for @xmath401 , but they miss the breakout value by @xmath402 and @xmath403 , respectively .",
    "litvinova & nadzhin ( 1990 ) suggested that spherical effects would act to truncate the planar acceleration once a shell had reached a truncation radius @xmath404 .",
    "using our solution to the self - similar expansion , we can evaluate this prescription for different truncation radii and compare it to the results of fully spherical calculations (  [ ss : commonform ] ) .",
    "the normalized position @xmath405 corresponding to @xmath355 is , @xmath406 taking @xmath407 as an illustrative example ( figure [ fig : vfvsfig ] ) , the self - similar solution can be fit as a polynomial in @xmath161 in accordance with equation ( [ eq : stx0 ] ) : @xmath408 these fit the self - similar solution quite well , with maximum errors @xmath409 and @xmath410 for @xmath47 and @xmath53 , respectively , in the entire range @xmath411 .",
