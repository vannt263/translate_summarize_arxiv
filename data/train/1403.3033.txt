    "in quantum mechanics the term overcompleteness is used to designate a redundant set of vectors that spans a system s hilbert space .",
    "we loosely refer to such a set as an overcomplete _ basis _ , while it would be preferable to use the term _ tight frame _ @xcite . since the former is a widely used terminology we will employ it , keeping in mind that it is not a minimal generating set .",
    "the use of a frame of this type gives rise to an infinity of representations in the sense that a single ket can be decomposed in different ways in terms of the same set of vectors . in this regard the terms  choosing a basis \" and  choosing a representation \" , which are routinely used interchangeably , are no longer equivalent .",
    "why would one bother to represent a vector in a potentially ambiguous way ?",
    "it turns out that the elements of certain overcomplete basis have a relevant physical meaning and mathematical properties that have proved to be very helpful .",
    "the use of canonical coherent states @xmath5 , arguably the most important overcomplete set in physics @xcite , is more than sufficient to illustrate the physical relevance of these sets .    for a basis to be fully operational , one should be able to write a closure relation in terms of it .",
    "the standard way to do that with coherent states is to represent the unit operator by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a complex label and the integration is over its real and imaginary parts .",
    "the overcompleteness of @xmath8 is a direct consequence of the analyticity of the bargmann function @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being a convergent sequence on the complex plane , has been shown to constitute a basis @xcite . as a corollary , it is possible to represent any ket in terms of coherent states belonging to any curve with non - zero length in the complex plane .",
    "works can be found in the literature in which different subsets of @xmath5 are used to construct alternative representations .",
    "an interesting example is the circle decomposition , in which an arbitrary ket can be written as @xmath12 where only coherent states on the circle of radius @xmath13 are used @xcite . in a related representation ,",
    "only coherent states of vanishing momentum are employed ( corresponding to the real axis in the @xmath7-plane ) @xcite .",
    "these and other @xcite examples make it clear the redundant character of @xmath14 .    in addition , there is another property that is particularly relevant : two arbitrary coherent states are never orthogonal .",
    "this property has an immediate consequence , namely , the unit operator can also be expressed as @xmath15 which is not trivially equivalent to ( [ i0 ] ) .",
    "note that in the @xmath16 representation , e.g , the analogous of ( [ i0b ] ) would be identical to that corresponding to ( [ i0 ] ) , since @xmath17 .",
    "the significance of relations ( [ i0 ] ) and ( [ i0b ] ) is described by klauder and sudarshan as  two manifestly different decompositions for the same operator in terms of one set of states \" @xcite .",
    "they also describe ( [ i0 ] ) as involving a superposition of  like outer products \" in opposition to ( [ i0b ] ) which is a composition of  unlike outer products \" @xcite , involving a double phase - space integration .    despite the many alternative representations , the only existing expressions for the unit operator in terms of coherent states were ( [ i0 ] ) and its immediate consequences , e.g. , ( [ i0b ] ) . the only exceptions being a result by solari @xcite , and @xmath18 with @xmath19 being a positive real number , derived in @xcite , both employing  unlike outer products \" inside a _ single _ phase - space integration .",
    "the above identity can be pictorially understood as follows .",
    "coherent - state overcompleteness not only imply in redundancy , but also in non - orthogonality , ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore , we can take the component of an arbitrary ket @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and force it to be the coefficient of @xmath21 in the `` wrong direction '' @xmath23 provided that we correct this by an appropriate measure in phase space .",
    "we will return to this point shortly .",
    "identities like ( [ i1 ] ) considerably add to the multifold ambiguity in the definition of coherent - state path integrals @xcite in a way that is not directly related to ordering , but rather to the off - diagonal character of the identities .",
    "our objective in this work is twofold .",
    "first we provide a common ground for unlike closure relations like those in @xcite also presenting a generalization of ( [ i1 ] ) to spin coherent states , and , second , we employ the solari identity to develop a phase - space path integral for which the contributing trajectories obey dynamical equations with the classical hamiltonian @xmath24 replaced by a weak energy value as originally defined by aharonov , albert , and vaidman @xcite : @xmath25 where the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 are such that @xmath28 .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly list some basic properties of coherent states . in section iii we re -",
    "derive the relation given in @xcite in a clearer , algebraic way .",
    "we then proceed , in section iv , to derive our phase - space path integral and discuss its semiclassical limit .",
    "finally , in section v , we call attention to some recurrences in quantum phase - space transforms , and summarize our conclusions . in the appendix we use an overcomplete set in @xmath29 to make our point about unlike closure relation explicit in the simplest possible framework .",
    "there are entire books dedicated to the properties and applications of coherent states .",
    "classical examples are those by perelomov @xcite and by klauder and skagerstam @xcite .",
    "a more recent account is the book by gazeau @xcite . in this section",
    "we list a few properties of canonical coherent states that will be directly used in the remainder of this work .    given an harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath30 and angular frequency @xmath31 , a canonical coherent state @xmath32 is defined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the bosonic annihilation operator and @xmath35 . an equivalent and insightful definition is @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the ground state of the harmonic oscillator , and the displacement operator is given by @xmath38 where , in the second equality , we used the baker - haussdorf formula .",
    "we start by realizing that the unlike , or off - center , closure relation ( [ i1 ] ) derived in @xcite can be written in a more suggestive way as ( for an elementary example see the appendix ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is replaced by @xmath41 , since @xmath19 is the jacobian determinant associated to the linear transformation @xmath42 and @xmath43 , assuming that @xmath7 and @xmath44 are independent variables .",
    "this is an usual procedure that is justified by the analytical extension of @xmath45 and @xmath46 into the complex plane ( see @xcite ) .",
    "next we give an alternative derivation of a result by solari .",
    "since it was presented as a side result in the appendix of @xcite , and seems to remain largely unknown , we believe this alternative derivation is in order .",
    "we do it in terms of what we may call weyl - like outer products .",
    "define @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an arbitrary complex number , representing a point in phase space .",
    "we start by disassembling ( [ b ] ) in terms of its constituent displacement operators [ see ( [ displace ] ) ] .",
    "note that @xmath49 which readily leads to @xmath50 . replacing this relation in ( [ b ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath51 where we used @xmath52 and the baker - hausdorff formula .",
    "thus we prove that ( [ b ] ) is a genuine resolution of unit and , in addition , we note that it can also be written in the form , @xmath53 which is a strong operator identity by the very nature of its derivation .      to show that our analysis is not limited to canonical coherent states , we now address spin coherent states .",
    "let @xmath54 be a general angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics , i.e. , @xmath55=i \\hbar \\hat{j}_3 $ ] , etc .",
    "an arbitrary rotation on a ket in a @xmath56-dimensional hilbert space ( @xmath57 ) can be characterized by the operator @xmath58 , @xmath59 being an arbitrary complex number and @xmath60 an angle .",
    "also @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "a spin coherent state is defined by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 stands for a normalization constant  @xcite and @xmath65 is an arbitrary reference state in the @xmath56-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "if we choose this state to be an eigenstate of @xmath66 , and more specifically , the one with the larger eigenvalue , @xmath67 , then we simply get @xmath68 , with @xmath69 . in this context",
    "it is easy to show that the inner product is @xmath70 and that the resolution of unity can be written in terms of continuous complex variables as @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "our natural candidate for a spin coherent state unlike closure relation is @xmath73 which is analogous to identity ( [ i1 ] ) with @xmath19 also being a real , positive number .",
    "the demonstration is quite simple .",
    "note that @xmath74 where we employed polar variables @xmath75 .",
    "the angular integration gives @xmath76 , and proceeding the change @xmath77 , it is immediate that ( [ is2 ] ) reduces to @xmath78 , showing that ( [ is2 ] ) is indeed a closure relation .",
    "in this section we apply identity ( [ iweyl ] ) to build a phase - space path integral in which the role of the hamiltonian is played by a weak energy value .",
    "below we give the analogous of klauder s first form of the path integral @xcite .",
    "we intend to evaluate the propagator @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the hamiltonian operator . defining @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and",
    "@xmath83 one can write @xmath84 the limit @xmath85 is taken along with @xmath86 such that the product @xmath87 remains constant . by inserting @xmath88 unit operators ( [ iweyl ] ) between the products we obtain @xmath89 we , thus , get an inconvenient asymmetry , since there is no @xmath90 in the denominator of the last term .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented at the cost of an extra constraint , namely , @xmath91 , implying @xmath92 . in the continuum @xmath48",
    "becomes a function of time , so that the previous condition reads @xmath93 . with this",
    ", it is harmless to write @xmath94 let us recast the numerator in this expression as @xmath95 where @xmath96 therefore @xmath97 with @xmath98 expression ( [ path1 ] ) represents a valid discrete version of a phase - space path integral . typically , the paths that enter in the evaluation of ( [ path1 ] ) are nowhere continuous .",
    "however , it is helpful , although not rigorously justifiable , to imagine the paths to be continuous and differentiable and take the limit @xmath99 before proceeding to the integrations .",
    "this assumption becomes more reasonable in the semiclassical regime , since in this limit we expect that the contributing paths are in the vicinity of the classical ( smooth ) trajectory .",
    "the key point is that , in this case , one can write @xmath100 , where @xmath101 for @xmath86 . to first order in @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "we get @xmath104 exchanging the ordering of integrations and products and taking the limit @xmath85 , we get @xmath105 where @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is the continuous counterpart of ( [ hn ] ) .",
    "the discrete quantity @xmath108 becomes @xmath109+\\frac{1}{2}(z-\\zeta)\\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}t}(z+\\zeta)^ * -\\frac{1}{2}(z+\\zeta)^*\\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}t}(z-\\zeta)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally one can write the formal expression for the path integral as @xmath110 + \\frac{i}{\\hbar}s_{\\zeta } \\right\\}\\,{\\cal d}z\\;,\\ ] ] where the first expression in the argument of the exponential is a surface term for which we already employed the condition @xmath93 . the last term is a generalized action @xmath111\\,{\\rm d}t \\ ; , \\label{sfraca}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes time derivative . for @xmath112",
    "the surface term vanishes and we get @xmath113=\\int_0^t\\,{\\rm d}t [ ( p\\dot{q}-q\\dot{p})/2-{\\cal h}_0]$ ] , @xmath114 , as expected . while @xmath115 is a real function of the phase - space coordinates @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 is , in general , complex valued .",
    "this might seem a strong disadvantage of expression ( [ path2 ] ) , but , in fact , it is not . the functions @xmath119 and @xmath118 fully assume the role of hamiltonians into classical equations of motion only in the semiclassical limit .",
    "it is well known , however , that in this regime , even for @xmath119 , the classical trajectories are , so to speak , overloaded with boundary conditions [ @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which can be satisfied only by extending both @xmath122 and @xmath123 to the complex plane . in this context , a complex function as the effective hamiltonian is fairly natural .",
    "it is worth to note that ( [ hfraco ] ) is a weak energy value as originally defined by aharonov , albert , and vaidman @xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ weak ] ) for @xmath124 ( which is always fulfilled in the present case ) . in fact , in addition , we should have @xmath125 , which would demand @xmath126 in ( [ hfraco ] ) .",
    "thus , in this regime , the complex number @xmath118 , is a weak value of energy related to the states @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this kind of weak value has been studied in @xcite and shown to make the nonclassical properties of coherent states explicit . for small",
    "@xmath129 one can write @xmath130 where @xmath131 stands for the anticommutator , @xmath132 and we used @xmath133 .",
    "after reordering operators , the previous expression can be written as @xmath134| z \\rangle+\\zeta\\langle z| [ \\hat{a}^{\\dagger},\\hat{h}]| z \\rangle+o(|\\zeta|^2)\\;.\\ ] ] here we must be careful in handling the expectation values by noting that @xmath135| z(t ) \\rangle \\ne i \\hbar \\dot{z}(t)$ ] , since @xmath136 is not , in general , a solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "nonetheless , when the system scales ( size , energy , etc ) are such that @xmath137 , given that @xmath138 is a coherent state , it will remain so for a time which is longer for larger ratios @xmath139 , with the center of the packet following , to first order , the classical trajectory . in this quasi - classical regime @xmath140 .",
    "it is also a well known result that @xmath141 @xcite . in this limit",
    "one can write the quasi - classical weak energy value as @xmath142\\;.\\ ] ] with @xmath143 and recalling that @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is a constant with dimension of @xmath146 ( for the harmonic oscillator @xmath147 ) .",
    "therefore , the real part of the quasi - classical weak energy is the hamiltonian itself , while the imaginary part ( first order in @xmath129 and zeroth order in @xmath148 ) depends on the tangent field in phase space . by replacing this into ( [ sfraca ] )",
    "we get , with a slightly abusive language , the associated weak action integral .",
    "about ninety years after schrdinger discovered coherent states as quasi - classical minimum uncertainty wave functions @xcite , they can still offer us some surprise .",
    "the structure behind overcomplete tight frames is richer if they fulfill the mutual non - orthogonality property [ we say that @xmath149 is a mutually overlapping ( or mutually non - orthogonal ) frame if @xmath150 for all possible pairs @xmath151 and @xmath152 . under this condition we showed that all known unlike closure relations can be expressed as : @xmath153 where d@xmath154 is a volume element ( d@xmath155 d@xmath156 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath157 has a non - zero projection onto every @xmath158 in the set , enlarges the notion of component or coefficient of a vector , such that @xmath159 can be made the component associated to @xmath160 , provided that this is accompanied by a suitable correction by an _ amplifying _ measure , @xmath161 , where the amplification @xmath162 is larger for larger euclidian distances @xmath163 .",
    "it is curious to realize that the appearance of this kind of weighting factors in quantum mechanical integrals is not unusual , although , some times concealed .",
    "as an example consider the weyl symbol of an arbitrary operator @xmath164 @xcite , given by @xmath165 and note that it can be expressed as @xmath166 another case , belonging to a slightly different category , is the recently defined dual representation to the bargmann function @xmath167 @xcite , that has found some application in semiclassical physics @xcite and in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a curve in the complex plane .",
    "the previous definition can be seen as an extension of a fourier transform connecting the wave function @xmath170 to the momentum representation @xmath171 these transformations can be mnemonically seen as though the two bra s @xmath172 in ( [ dual ] ) and @xmath173 in ( [ four ] ) take part in a sort of cancelation .",
    "the question raised about operators of the form ( [ conj ] ) , or more specifically , on which further functions @xmath174 , if any , would lead to resolutions of unity , seems to be one worth of some thought .",
    "the failure of the simple unilike resolution ( [ idiscrete ] ) in the appendix to have a valid counterpart in the hilbert space seems to indicate that analyticity is a necessary ingredient , that is , @xmath175 should be analytic functions of @xmath151 and @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "as for the alternative form of the coherent - state path integral we presented here , it is hoped that it may be useful , e. g. , in attenuating root - search problems in the semiclassical dynamics @xcite .",
    "a completely analogous procedure can be adopted to derive yet another form of the path integral starting from ( [ i1 ] ) . however",
    ", this does not seem to bring any relevant new information , unless a specific application arises .",
    "the issues addressed in this work are related to the early work @xcite and to the @xmath177-pseudo - boson formalism developed more recently @xcite , in particular , to the examples given in @xcite [ see eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) in this reference ] .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to note that we reached the concept of weak values with no reference to the delicate concept of quantum measurement .",
    "in this appendix we illustrate some aspects of coherent - state overcompleteness with a toy construction in the euclidean plane .",
    "a similar example can be found in @xcite , but here we go further to ensure the mutual overlapping property .",
    "we initially assume that @xmath182 , so that , the @xmath88 vectors have directions uniformly distributed over @xmath183 $ ] , with step @xmath184 . taking the continuum limit @xmath185",
    ", we get the well known result @xmath186 which resembles the quantum coherent state relation ( [ i0 ] ) in its form , and in the sense that a redundant set of vectors is employed to represent the resolution of unity with uniform weight . here",
    "the usual feature of overcompleteness appears : any pair of non - degenerate vectors @xmath187 suffices to generate arbitrary vectors in @xmath29 .",
    "this fact is the direct analogous of quantum representations using subsets of the @xmath7-plane @xcite .",
    "the above lines essentially correspond to the construction given by gazeau in @xcite .    for our purposes , however , the previous analogy is still insufficient because it disregards the essential fact that @xmath188 . in the present case",
    "@xmath189 does vanish if @xmath190 .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided if we assume @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is an irrational number that can be made _ arbitrarily small _ from the outset .",
    "the condition of orthogonality reads @xmath193 $ ] or @xmath194 $ ] . in both cases",
    "we have an irrational number in the left - hand side and a rational number in the right - hand side , thus , ensuring that any pair of vectors in the frame is non - orthogonal . the price to be paid",
    "is that there will be a residual anisotropy in the set @xmath195 [ see figure [ figure1 ] ] . with this",
    ", the operator @xmath196 , ( [ a ] ) , becomes @xmath197 .",
    "this apparently futile detail is important due to the nature of the unusual closure relation we deal with in what follows .",
    "specifically , let us investigate if it is possible to express the resolution of unity in terms of single sums of unlike outer products @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "we intend to write @xmath200 , were @xmath201 is a correction due to the projection of the @xmath202th component in the distinct direction @xmath203 .",
    "the point we want to stress is that @xmath204 which is well defined because of the mutual overlapping property , does the job . as an example",
