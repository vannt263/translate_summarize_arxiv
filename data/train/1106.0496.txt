    "ly@xmath0 emission - line searches have been widely used to find high - redshift galaxies and , for the highest redshift galaxies , this line is the only spectroscopic signature that can be used to confirm the redshift of a galaxy selected on the basis of its color properties .",
    "however , ly@xmath0 is a difficult line to interpret .",
    "because the line is resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , determining its escape path and hence its dust destruction is an extremely complex problem , both theoretically ( e.g. , neufeld 1991 ; finkelstein et al .  2007 ) and observationally ( e.g. , kunth et al .  2003 ; schaerer & verhamme 2008 ; stlin et al .",
    "thus , while we have empirical measurements that a significant fraction of uv - continuum selected samples have ly@xmath0 lines with rest - frame equivalent widths above 20  over a wide range of redshifts from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( shapley et al .  2003 ; cowie et al",
    ".  2010 , 2011 ; stark et al .  2010 ) , our understanding of what determines this fraction is still weak .",
    "in particular , we would like to know whether the presence of ly@xmath0 emission is related to other properties of the galaxy , such as its metallicity , extinction , morphology , or kinematics , and how the ly@xmath0 line escapes .    due to the difficulty with observing in the uv , we currently have much more information on the @xmath12 ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) and how their properties relate to those of other uv selected galaxies at these redshifts ( e.g. , shapley et al .  2003 ; reddy et al .  2010 ;",
    "kornei et al  2010 ) than we do on the local samples .",
    "however , there has been considerable controversy in the interpretation of these high - redshift observations .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that the laes are younger , lower mass , and metal poor , representing early stages in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , hu et al .  1998 ; nilsson et al .",
    "2007 ; gawiser et al .  2007 ) .",
    "however , other authors have argued that laes arise in relatively massive galaxies ( e.g. , lai et al .",
    "2008 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2009c ) with ages of around a gyr , that young galaxies have weaker ly@xmath0 than old galaxies ( shapley et al .",
    "2001 ) , and , more recently , that laes are older , less dusty , and in a later stage of galaxy evolution than sources with weaker ly@xmath0 emission ( kornei et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 signature can be produced by a range of galaxy types and masses , including even the most ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( e.g. , chapman et al .  2005 ; nilsson & mller 2009 ) , so some level of heterogeneity must be expected .",
    "however , all of the results that argue for the laes being predominantly old are based on spectral synthesis fitting , and most of the old ages inferred are almost certainly mis - estimates arising from the presence of very strong optical emission lines in the laes ( e.g. , schaerer & debarros 2009 ) .",
    "until recently the only low - redshift ly@xmath0 emitting sources that could be studied in detail were the local blue compact galaxies .",
    "however , these generally have much lower ly@xmath0 luminosities than the high - redshift laes , and , while some of the blue compact galaxies have been studied in exquisite detail ( e.g. , stlin et al .",
    "2009 ) on an individual basis , it has not been easy to form large , uniformly selected samples that can be statistically analyzed .",
    "thus , the recent determination that substantial @xmath13 samples of laes can be found ( deharveng et al .  2008 ) with the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _",
    "( martin et al .  2005 ) grism spectrographs has enabled a new approach to the subject ( atek et al .  2009a ; finkelstein et al .  2009a , 2009b ; scarlata et al .  2009",

    "the low - redshift lae samples have many advantages .",
    "the galaxies are bright and can be easily studied at other wavelengths , but perhaps even more importantly , they can be integrated into comprehensive studies of galaxies at the same redshifts to understand the selection biases intrinsic to the samples .",
    "early papers on _ galex _ laes worked with relatively small samples , but the general conclusions are that low - redshift laes are somewhat heterogeneous yet more weighted to low metallicities and extinctions and more likely to be small , compact galaxies when compared to uv - continuum selected galaxies without detected ly@xmath0 with the same luminosities in the same redshift interval .    here",

    "we use the optical data to remove the small number of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that were not previously identified from the uv spectra and then provide our final sample of candidate lae galaxies in the two redshift intervals .",

    "we use the spectra to determine the emission - line contributions to the broadband fluxes and to show that these corrections must be included if spectral synthesis fitting is to give accurate ages for the youngest ( @xmath15 yr ) galaxies . in section  [ secint ]",

    "uv - continuum selected sources with the same uv - continuum magnitude distributions , we also observed at optical wavelengths sources randomly chosen from the _ galex _ uv spectroscopic sample that did not have uv spectral line identifications .",
    "the latter is not a complete sample of all such sources in the field , but rather a randomly chosen subsample with an nuv magnitude selection function that is similar to that for the sources with strong ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "thus , it may be directly compared to the lae sample .",
    "we have obtained optical spectra for 450 of the 5642 objects in the total uv - continuum selected sample without detected ly@xmath0 .",
    "114 of these sources lie in the redshift interval @xmath1 , and 5 lie in the redshift interval @xmath2",
    ". we will hereafter refer to these sources as our _ uv - continuum sample_. these sources may be viewed as analogs of high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) without strong ly@xmath0 emission and can be combined with the lae sample to understand how ly@xmath0 galaxies are related to the more general uv - continuum selected population . in order to compare the numbers of uv - continuum sources with a given property with the lae sample we need to correct for the fraction of uv - continuum sources that were observed .",
    "there is a weak dependence of the observed fraction on the nuv magnitude , ranging from @xmath49 observed at nuv=20 to @xmath50 observed at nuv=22 .",
    "we use the inverse of this fraction as a function of the nuv magnitude to provide the weighting to the uv - continuum sample .    the new optical spectroscopic data presented in this paper more than doubles the optical spectroscopic data used in cowie et al .  ( 2010 ) .",
    "there we observed with deimos ( including four literature redshifts ) 34 of the 62 @xmath1 laes given in their table 15 ( this also includes ew(ly@xmath51    sources ) and 1 of the 4 @xmath2 laes given in their table 16 .",
    "we also observed with deimos 124 uv - continuum selected sources without detected ly@xmath0 , of which 46 were in the redshift interval @xmath1 and none were in the redshift interval @xmath2 .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained at a near - parallactic angle to minimize atmospheric refraction effects . however , in some cases the mask configuration did not allow for this .",
    "in addition , a small number of the spectra were obtained during periods of varying extinction .",
    "all of the spectra were relatively calibrated using the measured response from observed calibration stars . however",
    ", relative slit losses always pose a problem , and special care must be taken for the flux calibration .",
    "for each spectrum we fitted all of the emission lines using the idl mpfit program of markwardt ( 2009 ) .",
    "we used simultaneous gaussian fits to neighboring lines together with a linear fit to the continuum baseline . for weaker lines we held the full width constant , using the value measured in the stronger lines , and set the central wavelength to the measured redshift .",
    "we also measured the noise as a function of wavelength by fitting to random positions in neighboring portions of the spectrum and computing the dispersion in the results .    for the agn classifications and the metallicity measurements we used only the ratios of the emission lines that are close in wavelength .",
    "these line flux ratios can be robustly measured from the spectra without even the relative flux calibration , since for these neighboring lines the deimos response is essentially constant . for the primary lines used in our analysis we give the line ratios and their @xmath40 errors in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .        in order to measure the absolute h@xmath0 and h@xmath26 line fluxes , we used the measured ew(h@xmath0 ) and",
    "ew(h@xmath26 ) in combination with the measured continuum fluxes at the appropriate wavelength .",
    "we first determined which sdss filter the emission line lay in and then integrated through the transmission of this filter to obtain the averaged spectral flux .",
    "we then renormalized the spectrum to match the corresponding sdss model c magnitude from the dr6 release ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "we then determined the continuum flux and multiplied this by the observed - frame ew to obtain the corresponding line flux .",
    "this is an approximation , since it assumes that the measured ew is representative of the value averaged over the total light of the galaxy , including regions outside the slit .",
    "however , for the photometric cases we derive very similar values directly from the calibrated spectra , including calibrated spectra that we obtained using larger ( @xmath52 ) slit widths for a small subset of the galaxies .",
    "this suggests the procedure is relatively robust .",
    "however , the relative apertures used in measuring the _ galex _ ly@xmath0 fluxes and the optical emission line fluxes may introduce systematic variations reflecting the relative geometries of the emission .",
    "thus , the @xmath53(ly@xmath0)/@xmath53(h@xmath0 ) ratios are more reliably obtained in large ( @xmath54 ) aperture measurements , such as those used in atek et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "in the present paper we are primarily concerned with determining the optical continuum and emission - line properties that result in a galaxy showing a strong ly@xmath0 emission line and not so much with the relative fluxes of the optical and ly@xmath0 emission lines , making this less of a concern . in the discussion",
    "we will note where aperture effects might play a role .    in order to check the calibrations and aperture effects",
    ", we tested our measured fluxes against the independent measurements by scarlata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the subset of galaxies that overlap with our sample . the scarlata et al .",
    "data were obtained with a larger @xmath55 slit . for eight cases they compared their results with those made in a @xmath54 slit , finding only small differences between the two measurements .",
    "scarlata et al.s procedure for measuring the fluxes relied on the relative accuracy of the spectrophotometry , using the @xmath56 magnitude from the sdss data to set the absolute flux normalization .",
    "this differs from our procedure , where we normalized each region of the spectrum separately to the sdss magnitudes .",
    "we compare the two results in figure  [ error_claudia ] , where we show both the @xmath53(ly@xmath0)/@xmath53(h@xmath0 ) ( red squares ) and the @xmath53(h@xmath26)/@xmath53(h@xmath0 ) ratios ( blue diamonds ) .",
    "the overall agreement is very good , but in a small number of cases the disagreement is much larger than the statistical error in the @xmath53(ly@xmath0)/@xmath53(h@xmath0 ) ratio . in the most extreme case",
    "the ratios differ by a multiplicative factor of just over two .",

    "in figure  [ ewha_time](b ) we show the ages derived from the corrected broadband fluxes .",

    "we can see from figure  [ ewha_time](a ) that nearly all of the sources with strong ew(h@xmath0 ) are assigned ages of about a gyr .",
    "thus , without the line correction , we would consider there to be no difference in age for a wide range of ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , we can see from figure  [ ewha_time](b ) that when the line correction is made , we obtain a smooth evolution in age with the strongest ew(h@xmath0 ) sources having the lowest ages of about 10  myr .",
    "the high ew(h@xmath0 ) sources are quite well described by a constant sfr model ( black solid curve in figure  [ ewha_time](b ) ) , but at lower ew(h@xmath0 ) , the sources tend to fall below this curve , presumably as the sfr begins to decline .",
    "the data are quite well represented by a single power law fit @xmath109 where the age t is in myr and the ew(h@xmath0 ) is in  .",

    ". it is worth emphasizing that in both the lae and uv - continuum samples the galaxies are chosen solely on the basis of their nuv magnitudes ; that is , they have nuv@xmath110 , lie in the redshift interval @xmath1 , and have the same nuv magnitude distribution .",
    "the only difference between the two samples is the presence or absence of strong ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "thus , while there might be a relation between the nuv magnitude and the ew(h@xmath0 ) , this will operate in the same way in both samples and will not affect any comparison .",
    "for the lae sample ( red shaded histogram ) we plot the sum of the inverse areas over which a galaxy with a given nuv magnitude could be observed in the _ galex _ fields ( cowie et al .",
    "( we also corrected the lae density for the @xmath108 of sources that were not spectroscopically observed . ) for the uv - continuum sample ( blue histogram ) we also weight the areas with the fraction of sources that we observed as a function of nuv magnitude .",
    "the black solid curve shows the shape computed from a model where we assume a constant rate of formation of galaxies and that the time spent in each equivalent width bin is determined from equation  1 .",
    "the normalization is proportional to the birthrate of galaxies , and we have matched it to the observed surface density .",
    "we can see that this model matches well to the shape at high ew(h@xmath0 ) , so the surface density of galaxies versus the ew(h@xmath0 ) is also consistent with a constant production rate of new galaxies that then evolve with a constant sfr .",
    "we can also see from the figure that ly@xmath0 emission is rare in sources with ew(h@xmath0)@xmath111    ( about @xmath112 of galaxies ) but common in higher ew(h@xmath0 ) sources where the blue and red histograms become comparable .",

    "this again shows that the laes are drawn primarily from the youngest galaxies .",
    "the remaining @xmath115 of laes with ew(h@xmath0)@xmath111  may have geometries , kinematics , or orientations that are unusually conducive to ly@xmath0 escape .",

    "figure  [ ewha_plots](b ) shows that there is also a size evolution as a function of ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the higher ew(h@xmath0 ) sources are generally unresolved at the @xmath117 resolution of the cfht megaprime @xmath35-band images , while the lower ew(h@xmath0 ) sources are generally extended .",
    "however , unlike in the other correlations , there is a significant difference between the laes and the uv - continuum sources at the same ew(h@xmath0 ) . from figure  [ ewha_plots](b )",
    "we can see that at the same ew(h@xmath0 ) , sources with ly@xmath0 emission are significantly smaller than those without ; that is , where ly@xmath0 is strong is in the most compact sources at a given ew(h@xmath0 ) . a rank - sum test shows that there is a @xmath118 probability that the laes at ew(h@xmath119    are physically as large as the uv - continuum sources with the same ew(h@xmath0 ) selection .",
    "( we have chosen the ew(h@xmath0 ) to provide a significant number of uv - continuum sources since there are only 4 uv - continuum sources with ew(h@xmath120  as can be seen in figure  [ ewha_plots](b ) ) .",

    "the ground - based @xmath35-band imaging is inadequate to resolve the sizes for most of the laes .",

    "we can measure the dust extinction from the galaxies in several ways : from the uv spectral slopes , from the sed fits , and from the balmer ratios .",
    "we may intercompare these measurements and also use each of them to test the effects of extinction on the ly@xmath0 line .    in figure",
    "[ ewha_plots](c ) the uv spectral index , which is often used as a measure of the stellar extinction , shows a general trend towards less negative values as we move to lower ew(h@xmath0 ) , which would be expected if the extinction is rising as the galaxies age .",
    "however , there is a good deal of scatter , and at least part of the change is caused by evolution in the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the evolution of the reddening may be more clearly seen in figure  [ ewha_plots](d ) : the balmer ratio shows a systematic decrease as the ew(h@xmath0 ) decreases , indicating an increase in the nebular extinction .",

    "the fact that both the lae and uv - continuum galaxies follow a surprisingly tight track in this diagram with n2 rising as ew(h@xmath0 ) decreases appears to show that we are seeing a smooth metal build - up with age in both classes of galaxies .    in order to translate n2 to a metallicity in the galaxies we use the pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) local relationship , @xmath9(o / h)@xmath129n2 , which was determined by comparing to direct measures of the o abundance over the range n2=@xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "extrapolating the pettini & pagel relation to these galaxies requires assuming that there is no change in the ionization parameter , which may well be incorrect .",
    "however , at @xmath1 cowie & barger ( 2008 ) found a narrow range of ionization parameters ( @xmath132 ) and a similar relation to that of pettini & pagel .",
    "cowie & barger ( 2008 ) also showed that other line diagnostics gave similar metal - luminosity relations to that derived from n2 in the redshift interval @xmath1 .",
    "we can also test the pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) relation with the present data .",
    "ten of the @xmath1 sources have [ oiii]@xmath27 detected at above the @xmath133 level .",
    "these are marked with green diamonds in figure  [ bpt](a ) .",
    "none of the uv - continuum sample at @xmath1 has detected [ oiii]@xmath27 at the @xmath133 level .",
    "all of the [ oiii]@xmath27 galaxies have low values of n2 , except for _ galex _ 1240 + 6233 , which is classified as an agn based on the bpt diagram .",
    "conversely , most of the low - n2 galaxies are detected in [ oiii]@xmath27 .",
    "for the sources that are not agns and where we have detected [ oiii]@xmath27 we used the ` direct ' or @xmath134 method to determine the metallicity ( e.g. , seaton 1975 ; pagel et al .",
    "1992 ; pilyugin & thuan 2005 ; izotov et al .",
    "2006 ) . to derive @xmath134[o ]  and",
    "the oxygen abundances , we used the izotov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) formulae , which were developed with the latest atomic data and photoionization models .",
    "we compare the derived o abundances with n2 in figure  [ n2ha_test ] ( red squares ) , where we also show similar measurements from a sample of ultra - strong emission - line galaxies taken from hu et al .",
    "( 2009 ; green diamonds ) . the o abundance versus n2 is broadly consistent with the pettini & pagel relation ( black line ) , though there is a good deal of scatter , probably reflecting the variation in the ionization parameter .",
    "we can see immediately from figure  [ ewha_plots](f ) that the laes in the redshift interval @xmath1 have lower values of n2 than the uv - continuum sources ( see also figure  [ bpt ] ) .",
    "this effect was previously noted by cowie et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , though the present larger sample substantially increases the statistical significance of the result .",
    "this result may be more clearly seen in figure  [ n2ha_dist ] , where we show the n2 distributions for the lae ( red shaded histogram ) and uv - continuum ( blue histogram ) samples . while the n2 distributions overlap , the distribution for the laes clearly extends to lower values , and the median n2 is lower .",
    "a rank - sum test gives only a @xmath135 probability that the two _ galex _ samples are similar .",
    "using the pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) conversion gives a median @xmath9(o / h)=8.24 ( 8.17 , 8.35 ) for the laes , where the quantities in parentheses are the @xmath125 range .",
    "this is about 0.4  dex lower than that of the uv - continuum sample , though the median value for the uv - continuum sample is more poorly determined , since at the higher values of n2 the conversion breaks down as the n2 value saturates .",
    "we can now see from figure  [ ewha_plots](f ) that the difference in n2 distributions is primarily a reflection of the evolutionary state of the galaxy .",
    "that is , the metallicity is building up with age , and the laes are preferentially drawn from the younger galaxies .",
    "uv - continuum galaxies have similar metallicities to laes with the same ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , the lae sample is much more weighted to high ew(h@xmath0 ) galaxies , which are younger and more metal poor .",
    "in order to convert the observed quantities into physical properties of the galaxies , we will assume a constant sfr model with a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "as we have seen , this appears to provide a self - consistent fit to most of the observed properties . for simplicity , we assume that the imf extends smoothly from 0.1  m@xmath136 to 100  m@xmath136 , though this can be easily converted into other favored imfs with flatter slopes below m@xmath137 by a simple renormalization of the sfr .    in figure  [ ewha_halum ]",
    "we show the h@xmath0 luminosities of the lae and uv - continuum samples corrected for extinction using the balmer ratio and a fitzpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) extinction law .",
    "the median corrections for the lae and uv - continuum samples are 1.7 and 2.1 , respectively .    for our assumed constant sfr model",
    "the conversion from h@xmath0 luminosity to sfr is roughly invariant over the range of ew(h@xmath0 ) and is given by the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation : @xmath138 on the right - hand axis of figure  [ ewha_halum ] we give the sfr in m@xmath136  yr@xmath17 corresponding to a given h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "individual galaxies have sfrs that range from about 1  m@xmath136  yr@xmath17 up to about 30  m@xmath136 yr@xmath17 .",
    "the lower bound is roughly set by the nuv magnitude limit for the selection , but the upper bound on the sfr is a measure of the maximum sfrs seen in uv - continuum selected galaxies at these redshifts . on the top axis",
    "we give the logarithm of the age in years corresponding to a given ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the laes are primarily drawn from sources younger than @xmath139  gyr .",
    "we can see from figure  [ ewha_halum ] that there is no evolution in the distribution of the sfrs as a function of the ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our constant sfr assumption .",
    "there is also no difference in the distribution of the sfrs for the lae and uv - continuum galaxies .",
    "if the highest sfr galaxies maintain their rates for a subtantial fraction of the local age of the universe , then the final stages will have stellar masses in excess of @xmath140  m@xmath141",
    ".    0.25 cm        we can test our h@xmath0 luminosity - determined sfrs against those inferred from 20  cm observations ( where available ; see section  [ secother ] ) and those determined from the uv continuum . in figure  [ halum_radio_power ] we plot rest - frame 20  cm power calculated assuming a radio spectrum of @xmath142 versus extinction - corrected h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "we see a nearly linear relation , though the number of measured sources is fairly small .",
    "we compare the data with two conversions of the radio power to sfr : condon ( 1992 ; solid line ) and bell ( 2003 ; dashed line ) .",
    "the two relations appear to bracket the data points .",
    "( prior to the h@xmath0 extinction correction the points are more scattered and fall to the left of the expected relations . )",
    "there is one significantly deviant point , galex0959 + 0151 in cosmos  00 , where the h@xmath0 luminosity is very high compared to the radio power .",
    "this source has the highest ew(h@xmath0 ) in the figure ( @xmath143   ) and an age of 9  myr from sed fitting ( figure  [ ewha_time](b ) ) .",
    "this suggests that the radio power is low because the supernovae that generate the radio emission have yet to occur .",
    "unfortunately , the other sources in the sample with very high rest - frame ew(h@xmath0 ) are not in the fields with radio data , so we can not test this further at present .",
    "sfrs for high - redshift galaxies are generally calculated from the observed uv luminosity together with the stellar extinction correction determined from the uv continuum slope ( meurer et al .",
    "it is therefore interesting to commpare the sfrs derived using this method with those computed from the h@xmath0 luminosities in the present low redshift sample and to estimate the limits of its validity . in figure  [ ewha_mdot_ratio ]",
    "we show the ratio of the sfr derived from the stellar extinction corrected uv luminosity with that computed from the nebular extinction corrected h@xmath0 luminosity as a function of ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "we have computed the uv sfr from the @xmath144 luminosity , extinction corrected using the value derived from the uv spectral index , and converted using the value at @xmath145  yr computed from the starburst99 model , @xmath146 with this calibration the uv sfrs are closely matched to the h@xmath0 sfrs with an average ratio of 0.9 for sources with ew(h@xmath147   .",
    "this small absolute difference may be a simple consequence of the relative optical and uv calibrations . as can be seen in figure  [ ewha_mdot_ratio ]",
    ", the uv calibration underestimates the sfr at higher ew(h@xmath0 ) and overestimates it at lower ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the reasons for the deviations reflect the limit of validity of the underlying assumptions . at low ew(h@xmath0 ) the derivation of the uv continuum extinction from the uv spectral slope breaks down . the meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) correction is only applicable to starbursting galaxies , since it depends on the intrinsic spectral index being approximately fixed , as is the case for these sources ( see figure  [ ewha_plots](c ) ) . at low ew(h@xmath0 ) ( less than about 60   ) the intrinsic uv spectral indices are shallower , and the inappropriate use of the relationship overestimates the sfr , as can be seen in figure  [ ewha_mdot_ratio ] .",
    "a second problem with the uv continuum method is that the uv continuum flux evolves with time , even in the constant sfr models . in figure  [ ewha_mdot_ratio ]",
    "we show ( green curve ) the evolution of @xmath148 evaluated at 1600    ( @xmath144 ) as a function of ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "( the normalization is arbitrary and depends on the sfr . )",
    "the uv luminosity increases as a function of age up to @xmath149  yr or an ew(h@xmath150   .",
    "thus , the uv continuum calculation combined with the uv spectral index extinction correction should only be used over the ew(h@xmath147    range , or , equivalently , for rest - frame line - corrected galaxy colors of @xmath151 ( figure  [ ewha_plots](a ) ) .        in figure  [ ewha_metal ]",
    "we plot the metallicities of the lae ( red solid squares ) and uv - continuum ( blue diamonds ) samples versus the ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "if the gas reservoir were fixed , the constant sfr model would predict that the metallicities should rise linearly with time in the early stages .",
    "this is clearly much steeper than is seen in the present samples , which can be approximated by a model where the metallicity rises as @xmath152 ( black curve : this is only shown over the range of validity of the n2 diagnostic which is only appropriate for low metallicity and saturates at near solar metallicity ) .",
    "thus , the galaxies must have ongoing accretion of gas .    in figure  [ ewha_metal ]",
    "we also compare the present samples with a fainter continuum sample from the goods - n observations of barger et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( black triangles ) and with a fainter sample selected to have very high ew(h@xmath0 ) from hu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( green circles ) , as well as with the local blue compact galaxy sample of stlin et al .  ( 2009 ) ( open squares ) .",
    "as might be expected , the fainter samples have systematically lower metallicities than the present data . however , the effect is small compared to the ew(h@xmath0 ) dependence , suggesting that the ages of the galaxies primarily determine the metallicities .        using the sfrs derived from the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 luminosities and the masses derived from the constant sfr fits to the line - corrected seds , we show our final result in figure  [ m_hist ] . in figure  [ m_hist](a )",
    "we show the distribution of the sfrs .",
    "the two samples are nearly identical with a median of @xmath153  m@xmath136  yr@xmath17 . in contrast , as is shown in figure  [ m_hist](b ) , the laes , reflecting their younger ages , are systematically lower in mass than the uv - continuum sources .",
    "the median mass for the laes is @xmath105  m@xmath136 , while that for the uv - continuum sample is @xmath154  m@xmath136 .",
    "we analyzed a substantial sample of uv continuum - selected galaxies with and without ly@xmath0 emission lines to try to understand how laes are drawn from the general population and how they evolve with redshift . to do this",
    ", we obtained extensive optical spectroscopy of _ galex _ grism selected samples ( both lae samples and comparison samples with the same uv magnitude distributions but no detected ly@xmath0 ) in two redshift intervals : @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we used the optical spectroscopy to eliminate agns and to obtain the optical emission - line properties of the samples .",
    "we confirmed that the _ galex _ selected @xmath30 laes are considerably fainter and much rarer than the high - redshift laes ( deharveng et al .",
    "2008 ; cowie et al .",
    "cowie et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that the @xmath74 in a schechter ( 1976 ) function fit to the @xmath1 lae luminosity function is almost an order of magnitude fainter than the @xmath74 in a fit at @xmath76 and that only about @xmath155 of @xmath30 uv - continuum selected galaxies have rest - frame ew(ly@xmath22   .",
    "here we showed that there are also laes that can be found in the _ galex _ spectra at @xmath14 and that these are similar in luminosity to the most luminous high - redshift galaxies .",
    "thus , we conclude that most of the observed evolution occurs over the redshift interval @xmath3 .",
    "this appears to be a simple downsizing effect , with the presence of the higher ly@xmath0 luminosity sources at @xmath72 corresponding to higher sfr sources initiating their star formation at this redshift .",
    "we showed that at @xmath1 , sed fits to strong emission - line galaxies significantly overestimate the ages and masses and underestimate the extinctions if we do not correct for the emission - lines .",
    "we found that the sed fits to the uncorrected broadband fluxes give ages of about a gyr .",
    "however , the inferred ages drop substantially when we correct the galaxy broadband magnitudes using the observed spectra to remove the emission - line contributions .",
    "all the galaxies with ages much less than a gyr have strong emission lines and must be corrected for the line contributions .",
    "spectral synthesis fitting shows a smooth evolution of the rest - frame ew(h@xmath0 ) with age when the emission - line contributions are removed from the broadband fluxes .",
    "we found that at @xmath1 , all sources , regardless of the strength of the ly@xmath0 emission line , follow a single , well - defined sequence as a function of the rest - frame ew(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "higher ew(h@xmath0 ) sources all have lower metallicities , bluer colors , smaller sizes , and less extinction .",
    "the number distribution of galaxies versus the ew(h@xmath0 ) is consistent with a constant formation rate of new galaxies .",
    "the bulk ( @xmath156% ) of the laes lie at high ew(h@xmath120   , and @xmath157% of all uv - continuum selected galaxies with ew(h@xmath120     are laes .",
    "we conclude that the low - redshift laes are primarily drawn from a population of young galaxies that have recently initiated star formation .",
    "it appears that laes represent an early stage in a starburst when the star - forming gas is still relatively pristine and the primary star - forming region is small .",
    "it also appears that there is a time sequence , with the ly@xmath0 emission line dying away and the metallicity of the gas rising as the galaxy evolves .",

    "<S> we present optical spectroscopy of two samples of _ galex _ grism selected ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) : one at @xmath1 and the other at @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> we use the optical spectroscopy to eliminate active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and to obtain the optical emission - line properties of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the luminosities of the laes in the two redshift intervals and show that there is dramatic evolution in the maximum ly@xmath0 luminosity over @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the @xmath1 samples alone , we show that there are tightly defined relations between all of the galaxy parameters and the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the higher ew(h@xmath0 ) sources all have lower metallicities , bluer colors , smaller sizes , and less extinction , consistent with their being in the early stages of the galaxy formation process . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath4 of the laes have ew(h@xmath0)@xmath5   , and , conversely , that @xmath6 of galaxies with ew(h@xmath0)@xmath5    are laes . </S>",
    "<S> we correct the broadband magnitudes for the emission - line contributions and use spectral synthesis fits to estimate the ages of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find a median age of @xmath7  yr for the lae sample and @xmath8  yr for the uv - continuum sample without detected ly@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the median metallicity of the lae sample is @xmath9(o / h)=8.24 , or about 0.4  dex lower than the uv - continuum sample . </S>"
