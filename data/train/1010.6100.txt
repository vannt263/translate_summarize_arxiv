    "as pre - main - sequence ( pms ) low - mass stars ( @xmath60.6 m@xmath7 ) approach the zero - age main - sequence , their natal lithium content is rapidly destroyed by proton burning in regions where their interior temperature reaches above @xmath8 k. since the central temperature of a young star is a sensitive function of stellar mass and age @xcite , determining the mass , or equivalently the luminosity , at which stars in an open cluster fully deplete their initial lithium content allows us to measure the cluster age  the so - called lithium depletion boundary ( ldb ) method .",
    "the ldb stellar dating technique is model dependent ; however , unlike traditional isochrone modeling of the cmd , different evolutionary ldb models yield very similar ( @xmath410% ) ages @xcite .",
    "it is this model - insensitivity that makes ldb ages so valuable , not only as a tool to define and constrain models of stellar evolution , but more importantly in assisting us to identify missing input physics to be included in the more widely used isochrone modeling technique .",
    "ldb ages are inherently difficult to measure due to the necessity of procuring spectra of very faint , low - mass stars that have not yet depleted their natal lithium , typically a cluster s mid- to late - m dwarfs . furthermore , the technique is most sensitive to young stellar ages , @xmath010250 myr .",
    "these limitations have resulted in only five open clusters so far having ldb age determinations : pleiades ( 126@xmath411 myr ; @xcite ) , @xmath9 persei ( 90@xmath410 myr ; @xcite ) , ic  2391 ( 50@xmath45 myr ; @xcite ) , ngc  2547 ( 35@xmath44 myr ; @xcite ) , and ic  4665 ( 27@xmath45 myr ; @xcite ) . in this letter , we present initial results from our campaign to identify the ldb in the open cluster blanco  1 .",
    "blanco  1 is a relatively young ( 50150 myr ; @xcite ) , nearby southern open cluster ( 209 pc ; @xcite ) of particular astrophysical interest due to its high galactic latitude ( @xmath10 ) , and its comparable age to the well - studied pleiades cluster .",
    "considerable interest in the cluster has been driven by its reported metal - rich nature ( [ fe / h]@xmath110.23 ; @xcite ) , although a more recent , self - consistent determination now makes the cluster of near - solar composition ( [ fe / h]@xmath110.04@xmath40.04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a combination of the cluster s systemic motion , distance below the galactic plane ( @xmath0250 pc ) , and estimated age ( 50150 myr ) suggests that it was formed in or very near to the galactic plane , and has subsequently moved to its current galactic position .",
    "its galactic location makes it an highly attractive target for ldb study due its low level of field star contamination , making membership selection relatively straightforward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m07 ) assembled an infrared photometric catalog of the very low - mass ( vlm ) members of blanco  1 . in order to identify brown dwarf candidates in the cluster",
    ", they observed 17 photometric candidate members having i@xmath018.020.0 with low - resolution ( r@xmath01000 ) spectroscopy using the vlt fors2 and keck lris instruments . using a detailed spectral analysis technique , they identified 15/17 objects as probable cluster low - mass members .",
    "unfortunately , their spectral resolution level precluded measurement of the location of the ldb for blanco  1",
    ". however , m07 s list of probable members provides us with a robust target list for our ldb study , as the expected luminosity of the ldb in a cluster of age @xmath0100 myr and at a distance of @xmath0200 pc , corresponds to i@xmath1219 @xcite .",
    "we obtained spectra during 2009 october 1119 of seven probable blanco  1 members listed in m07 with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) in queue schedule mode on the gemini - north telescope @xcite .",
    "the targets have an apparent magnitude range bracketing the expected cluster s ldb , i.e. , i@xmath318.319.7 .",
    "we observed these blanco  1 candidates in 6 separate 5@xmath135@xmath145@xmath135 fields using 1@xmath15 slitlets for our target stars ( r@xmath04400 ) , employing the r831 ( g5302 ) grating blazed at 7570 , with a blue - blocking og515 ( g0306 ) filter .",
    "this instrument setup produced spectra with a wavelength range of @xmath057008000  with a resolution of 0.67   per pixel .",
    "exposure times were set between 65 and 110 minutes , depending on the faintest target in each field , resulting in spectra with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per pixel of @xmath010 and @xmath0500 for the faintest and brightest targets , respectively . exploiting the gmos multi - object mode",
    ", we used a recent optical survey , performed using the smarts 1.0 m telescope at ctio , to select an additional 8 stars with i@xmath1613.017.5 found in the 6 gmos fields that we identified as photometric candidate members from their location near the cluster sequence in an optical cmd ( see james et al . in prep ) .",
    "most of these stars had no previous ancillary evidence for cluster membership because their brightness falls below the faintness limit of most previous membership studies for the cluster ( e.g. , proper motions are currently limited to i@xmath1714.5 ; james et al . in prep ) .",
    "not only do the inclusion of these stars in our program increase the total number of known blanco  1 members , but they also help us identify the magnitude range of stars that have already depleted their lithium content , thus allowing for a more confident ldb measurement .",
    "in addition to these primary target stars , a dm6 radial - velocity ( rv ) standard star , gj  905 , was also observed with the identical instrument setup as our blanco  1 objects .",
    "we reduced all of our gmos spectra using the standard reduction routines available in the iraf gemini - gmos package , including bias removal , aperture extraction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "in table  [ tab1 ] , we list the 15 photometric cluster candidate members observed as part of our gmos observing program . for each object , we include positions , photometric properties , rvs , h@xmath9 equivalent widths ( ew ) , whether we detected absorption at 6708 , and each object s membership status .",
    "positions are taken from the 2mass catalog @xcite for stars with i@xmath617.5 ( i.e. , those stars taken from our optical catalog ) , and for fainter stars we use the positions published in m07 .",

    "rvs for each of blanco  1 targets ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) were measured by cross - correlating the gmos spectra with the rv standard star gj  905 .",
    "uncertainties on these rvs are relatively large ( @xmath20rv@xmath0515 km  s@xmath21 ) , which is due to the low snr of the target spectra and the moderate resolution of our observations .",

    "we also take into account a possible 0.1 magnitude offset of the cluster sequence in order to account for natural variability in young stars .",
    "we further rejected two targets due to their rv being inconsistent with single - star membership to the cluster . in both cases ,",
    "the rejected rv differed from the cluster systemic velocity by many @xmath23 ; however , we note that these rejected objects might in fact be cluster members in short - period binary systems .",
    "further rv measurements are required to confirm their binary nature .",

    "each membership criterion has its own level of field star contamination , therefore , we consider each individual property as necessary but not entirely sufficient on their own for cluster member rejection . by combining the three membership criteria we can be confident that stars satisfying all three properties are very likely single - star blanco  1 members .",

    ", we presently classify these two stars as cluster non - members .",
    "previous studies have shown that young , vlm ( spectral - type m0m9 ) , li - rich stars in similar - aged open cluster have ew(li)@xmath01  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the 6708  line is expected to saturate at @xmath00.60.7  according to the curves - of - growth given in @xcite .",
    "also , the saturated nature of the feature means its absence indicates significant li depletion has occurred ( e.g. , 90% li - depletion only reduces the ew(li ) by a factor of @xmath02 according to @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the presence or absence of the 6708  feature is an excellent indicator of pms li - depletion in stars .",
    "unfortunately , the combination of a low snr for our faintest stars and the medium resolution of gmos makes a direct ew measurements of the li feature in our blanco  1 spectra very uncertain .",
    "therefore , we employ a comparative analysis approach to detect the presence of li in our blanco  1 objects .",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the spectral region around the doublet at 6708  for the 10 blanco  1 cluster members . for comparison",
    ", we also plot spectra of similar spectral - type stars from the m - dwarf template catalog from the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss ; ) .",
    "these templates were produced by averaging over 4000 sdss stellar spectra for spectral - types dm0dl0 . due to the nature of the sdss , the majority of the combined spectra used for these templates are field m - dwarfs , and therefore are expected to be old enough ( @xmath190.5 gyr ) to have destroyed their initial lithium  except for the dl0 template which is expected to be below the mass necessary to reach a central li - depleting temperature .",
    "we matched the sdss spectra by determining the closest match to the major absorption features and overall shape of the pseudo - continuum of the gmos spectra .",
    "below each blanco  1 spectrum is a subplot of the moving integrated residual for the gmos and sdss spectra .",
    "these data points are derived by integrating over the gmos@xmath1sdss residual in a moving 5  window , with a moving step - size of 2 . by integrating over a moving window ,",
    "we average out the small difference between the gmos and sdss spectra ( e.g. , different spectral resolutions ) , and provide a better description of the significant deviation between the gmos and sdss spectra .",
    "the @xmath23-levels are derived from the r.m.s . of the residual outside of a 10  window centered on the li 6708  feature .",
    "we note that cfht - bl-49 is best matched with the dl0 template which still retains its natal li content ; therefore , as expected the residual does not show a significant difference at 6708 .",
    "a clear trend is present when looking at the distribution of li - absorption in vlm blanco  1 stars .",
    "namely , brighter ( higher mass ) blanco  1 members are ubiquitously li - poor ; any observed li absorption at 6708  is not significant beyond 1-@xmath23 .",
    "this suggests these stars have already gone through their pms li burning stage .",
    "fainter ( lower mass ) blanco  1 vlm stars are all observed to be li - rich with li absorption detections at or above @xmath03-@xmath23 .",
    "the transition from li - poor to li - rich is bracketed by cfht - bl-24 ( i@xmath318.54@xmath40.04 , i@xmath1k@xmath242.97@xmath40.05 ) and cfht - bl-38 ( i@xmath319.01@xmath40.04 , i@xmath1k@xmath243.12@xmath40.05 ) , defining the color / magnitude range in which the ldb is located .",
    "we contend that the ldb for blanco  1 is located at i@xmath318.78@xmath40.24 and i@xmath1k@xmath53.05@xmath40.10 , as represented by the box in the inset of figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "the uncertainties we place on the ldb ages for blanco  1 are derived solely from observational errors in the ldb s m@xmath25 and intrinsic i@xmath1k@xmath2 values : the error in the distance modulus ( 0.1 mag ) , the photometric uncertainty in the objects ( @xmath340.04 mag , @xmath350.05 mag ) , and , most significantly , the error in the ldb location in the i / i@xmath1k@xmath2 cmd .",

    "although inclusion of a moderate degree of core overshoot is mostly likely necessary , the chronometric inconsistencies seen between ldb and isochronal ages _ must _ also be influenced by inconsistencies in pms models .",
    "for example , if we use m@xmath39 at the ldb instead of m@xmath25 , we find an age of 150@xmath415 myr using the theoretical bcs of bcah98 .",
    "this suggests a possible range of at least @xmath020 myr , or @xmath015% uncertainty at an age of 130 myr , when comparing ldb ages derived using different colors / magnitudes predicted by the dusty model atmospheres .",
