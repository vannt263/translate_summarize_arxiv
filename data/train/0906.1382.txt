    "the action of scattering matrix is just a rephasing of the two - pion state @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the only two allowed isospin states because of bose - statistics .",
    "the two phases may be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pion momentum in the center of mass frame and parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called s - wave pion scattering lengths and are fundamental quantities of chiral perturbation theory .",

    "if @xmath12 indicates the charged pion mass , one may expect a threshold effect when the two neutral pion invariant mass takes the value @xmath13 which corresponds to a square root like singularity in the amplitude .",
    "the interference of this particular diagram with the tree level process generates a discontinuity in the first derivative of the @xmath14 spectrum .",
    "this singular behaviour of cross section near threshold is a well known phenomenon studied in the past by wigner  @xcite and is commonly called `` wigner cusp '' or simply `` cusp '' in the following .",
    "the cusp structure has been clearly seen by experiment na48 with a sample of @xmath15 fully reconstructed @xmath11 events .",
    "the experimental distribution of @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ cusp ] ) .",
    "a calculation of the effect has been published by n. cabibbo and g. isidori @xcite @xcite where the amplitude of the dominant charge - exchange diagram is parametrized in terms of pion scattering lengths as @xmath16 higher order terms involve different linear combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the cited theoretical models have been implemented by na48 in a fitting procedure to the experimental data in order to extract the scattering lengths parameters .",
    "the analysis is discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "the fitting region has been restricted to the range @xmath17 because the theoretical model adopted was developed as a taylor expansion around the cusp threshold .",
    "a few bins around the cusp have been also excluded from the fitting to limit the effect of coulomb corrections and pionium formation ( i.e. @xmath18 electromagnetic bound state ) @xcite .",
    "the quality of the fit is good ( @xmath19 ) and the values found are : @xmath20    the two statistical errors from the fit are strongly correlated with a correlation coefficient of @xmath21 .",
    "the external error quoted reflects the impact of uncertainties on branching ratios and form factors entering in the fitting procedure as well as an additional @xmath22 theoretical error estimated in reference @xcite quoted as the uncertainty from neglecting higher - order terms and radiative corrections in the rescattering model .",
    "a theoretical approach , alternative to cabibbo - isidori model , has been published in @xcite . in the future",

    "the following parametrization is used to determine form factors from the experimental data @xmath31 the phase difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 wave @xmath34 changes as the two pion invariant mass @xmath35 increases in a way involving the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath8 through a relation known as roy equation @xcite .",
    "a determination of the scattering lengths may be extracted from several measurement of the phase @xmath36 at different @xmath35 values .",
    "a measurement of @xmath36 for a particular value of @xmath35 can be done by measuring the @xmath37 distibution asymmetry , where @xmath37 is the angle between the plane containing pions and the one containing leptons .",

    "results are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite , @xcite and the level of experimental uncertainties allows one to conclude that scattering lengths measurements are so far the most stringent test of the chiral theory .",
