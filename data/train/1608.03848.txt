    "excitonic effects in both radiative and nonradiative recombination play an important role in photo- and electroluminescence processes , whose quantum yield is about 10% and 1% , respectively @xcite .",
    "their influence on the photoelectric processes in silicon - based devices , such as solar cells , was studied in a number of publications @xcite .",
    "investigations of bulk lifetime in silicon as a function of doping and excitation levels were initiated by hangleiter @xcite , who considered the spatial correlation of two electrons and a hole ( or two holes and an electron ) , which exists in the presence of an exciton .",
    "this correlation leads to an increased probability of auger recombination , in which the energy released is transferred to another charge carrier .",
    "it can proceed both via the interband and the deep impurity mechanisms .",
    "excitons effect on electoluminescence in silicon were considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of nonradiative exciton recombination in n - type silicon was overestimated in that work .    here",
    ", a more accurate value of exciton nonradiative lifetime is obtained by means of comparison between the theoretical and experimental dependences of the bulk lifetime on doping and excitation levels in silicon . in this comparison , improved theoretical expressions for the interband auger recombination rate from ref .   are used .",
    "the so obtained lifetime served as an input parameter to analyze the contribution of excitonic effects to the luminescence internal quantum yield in silicon .",
    "both the positive effect of radiative exciton recombination and the negative effect of nonradiative recombination are taken into account . quantum yield dependence on doping and excitation levels , as well as",
    "the influence of surface recombination on quantum yield at room temperature are analyzed .",
    "it is shown that , at shockley - hall - reed lifetime exceeding 1  ms , radiative exciton recombination dominates ; in the opposite case , the negative , i.e. , nonradiative effect takes over .",
    "as shown in ref .   based on the results obtained by hangleiter @xcite , the presence of the exciton subsystem in silicon at sufficiently high doping and excitation levels leads to an onset of the nonradiative exciton recombination channel via auger mechanism on deep impurities .",
    "its characteristic time is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is shockley - reed - hall lifetime , @xmath2 is the density of electron - hole pairs , consisting of the equilibrium , @xmath3 , and excess , @xmath4 , contributions , and @xmath5 is the parameter of the theory . in the case considered here , @xmath3 practically coincides with the doping level . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - radiative recombination rate can be written as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of recombination ( trap ) centers , @xmath8 the probability of auger recombination on an impurity , @xmath9 @xmath10 being the exciton bohr radius , @xmath11 the binding energy of the exciton ground state , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the effective densities of states in the conduction , valence , and exciton bands in silicon .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1a ] ) , taking into account that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the capture coefficient of a minority carrier by a deep impurity , gives @xmath17 taking @xmath18mev , @xmath19 nm , @xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22@xmath21 , @xmath23@xmath21 , @xmath24k , and assuming that the electron density is well below the mott transition threshold ( about @xmath25@xmath21 ) , we obtain @xmath26@xmath21 and @xmath27@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "as this estimate shows , the ratio @xmath28 in silicon is of the order of unity .",
    "this means that @xmath5 is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio of the capture coefficient by a deep impurity level to the probability of impurity - assisted auger recombination .",
    ", in n- and p - type silicon vs. ( a ) dopant density and ( b ) excitation level , obtained experimentally ( symbols ) and theoretically ( solid lines ) .",

    "there are reasons to believe that this figure underestimates the true value of @xmath5 , because , as will be shown below , it does not agree well with the experimental results published in those works , where the surface recombination rate was minimized to such a degree that its influence on @xmath34 was negligible . in this case , the effective recombination rate is determined by the shockley - hall - reed recombination , nonradiative exciton recombination , radiative band - to - band and exciton recombination , and interband auger recombination rates : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the interband recombination lifetime with the respective parameter @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the radiative exciton recombination lifetime with the parameter @xmath39 , see ref .  ,",

    "( [ 1])-([3 ] ) .",
    "we will treat the shockley - hall - reed lifetime as an adjustable parameter .",
    "let us focus on the room - temperature case .",
    "then , at low doping levels , the recombination parameters are @xcite @xmath41@xmath21/s and @xmath42@xmath21/s .",
    "as the doping level increases , the electron - hole interaction becomes screened , leading to the reduction of @xmath39 . to account for this effect , @xmath39 has to be multiplied by a factor @xmath43 $ ] , see ref .  .",
    "in order to find @xmath5 , we use the experimental dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath3 reported in refs .  , and also the improved empirical formula for @xmath40 obtained in @xcite .",
    "the results of comparison of the experimental @xmath44 curve with the theoretical one , obtained using the expressions from ref .",
    ", are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the theoretical calculations were performed using eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , both with and without taking into account the nonradiative exciton recombination .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the experimental dependence of @xmath34 on the excitation level from ref .  .",
    "it should be noted that , in order to obtain an accurate estimate for @xmath5 from the experimental curves for @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , using the relation ( [ 3 ] ) , the graphical accuracy is insufficient .",
    "therefore , we first excluded the effect of the interband auger recombination using the expressions from ref .",
    "( neglecting the radiative recombination ) . as a result , we obtained a simple expression @xmath45 which implies that the combination @xmath46 is a linear function of @xmath47 , whose slope is @xmath48 .",
    "note that the function @xmath49 is universal , i.e. independent of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows this function , obtained theoretically and based on the experimental results of refs .",
    "@xcite ( with interband auger recombination taken into account ) . for each of the three experimental curves",
    ", @xmath5 was found using the least squares method , yielding in all three cases very similar values @xmath50 it is this value that was used in all theoretical curves presented in this work .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the noticeable discrepancy between the theoretical curves that do and do not take the nonradiative recombination into account occurs at @xmath51 , and 0.4ms . at higher shockley - reed - hall lifetimes of 30 and 40",
    "ms , the two sets of curves are practically identical .",
    "we note that in the work , a value @xmath52@xmath21 was obtained using the simplified expression ( [ 3 ] ) , where only the first term was present in the right - hand side . however , as our analysis shows , interband auger recombination becomes operative at doping levels higher than @xmath53@xmath21 , which was not taken into account in ref .  .",
    "therefore , quadratic exciton nonradiative recombination plays a smaller role , and the parameter @xmath5 has a somewhat higher value .",
    "we note that , according to ( [ 2 ] ) , the obtained value @xmath54@xmath21 is realized when the ratio @xmath55@xmath21 .",
    "the independence of @xmath5 on the parameters of concrete deep centers can be explained by the fact that , on the one hand , responsible for the generation - recombination processes in silicon are the levels with high capture cross - section , whose energies are close to the middle of the bandgap . on the other hand , according to ref .  , @xmath8 depends only weakly on the specifics of the deep levels , but is determined by their energies .",
    "therefore , for the impurity levels , whose energy is close to the middle of the bandgap , the value of @xmath5 can be practically the same .",
    "we now apply the corrected value ( [ nx ] ) to analyze the influence of the excitonic effects on the internal luminescence quantum yield in silicon , which can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the semiconductor slab thickness , and @xmath58 the total recombination velocity on its both surfaces .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case , where the electron - hole pair diffusion length is large : @xmath59 .",
    "we will use the expression ( [ 3 ] ) and its truncated version , in which the terms due to the radiative and nonradiative exciton recombination are omitted .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the theoretical results for the internal luminescence quantum yield @xmath60 in n - type silicon .",
    "we assumed @xmath61cm / s , the smallest value obtained in ref .  .",
    "furthermore , we took @xmath62@xmath21 , and @xmath63 , and 1ms .",
    "the solid curves are obtained taking the exciton effects into account , and the dashed ones are obtained without them .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , inclusion of exciton effects leads to an increase of the luminescence quantum yield when radiative exciton recombination dominates at @xmath64 , and 5ms .",
    "the higher @xmath1 the larger luminescence quantum yield obtained taking the exciton effects into account . at @xmath65ms , exciton recombination",
    "practically does not affect luminescence quantum yield at @xmath66@xmath21 . at @xmath67@xmath21 ,",
    "the value of @xmath68 obtained without exciton effects is larger than with them .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are the theoretical dependence of the luminescence quantum yield on the excitation level obtained with ( solid ) and without ( dashed ) taking the exciton effects into account .",
    "as seen from this figure , all curves have a maximum .",
    "the highest value of @xmath69% is realized at @xmath70ms . at @xmath71 and 40ms",
    ", the curves @xmath72 obtained with exciton effects exceed the corresponding curves obtained without taking these effects into account , at all values of @xmath4 . for @xmath73ms ,",
    "the curve obtained with the exciton effects taken into account exceeds the one without exciton effect almost everywhere , except for the region near the maximum .",
    "finally , at @xmath65ms , the two curves practically coincide for @xmath74@xmath21 , whereas at higher @xmath4 , the curve obtained without exciton effects is higher .        presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the theoretical luminescence quantum yield as a function of surface recombination velocity @xmath58 with and without exciton effects ( solid and dashed curves , respectively ) . as seen in this plot ,",
    "exciton effects make @xmath75 higher at @xmath64 , and 5ms ; the two curves for @xmath65ms practically coincide .",
    "the higher @xmath1 , the smaller the surface recombination velocity , at which @xmath75 starts to decrease . at the typical value of @xmath58 of the order of @xmath76cm / s",
    ", quantum yield does not exceed 0.1% .",
    "thus , in order to increase luminescence quantum yield , efficient methods of surface passivation are required , see refs .   for a description of such methods . in particular , it is possible to substantially reduce surface recombination velocity by using @xmath77-si : h layers of nanometer thickness @xcite .",
    "we note that the curves from figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] are obtained under the assumption that the doping level , @xmath3 , and the excitation level , @xmath4 , are independent parameters .",
    "the latter is proportional to the irradiation intensity ; however , it also depends on the recombination mechanisms , including the interband auger recombination .",
    "therefore @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , in fact , related .",
    "this relation can be found from the generation - recombination balance equation for the photodiode silicon structures used to investigate electroluminescensce . in the open - circuit regime , and for @xmath78 , this equation has the form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the short - circuit current , and @xmath81 is the area of the semiconductor structure .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the internal luminescence quantum yield as a function of doping level for am1.5 conditions .",
    "as before , these curves are build with and without taking exciton effects into account ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the photocurrent density was assumed to be @xmath82ma/@xmath83 . to build these curves , we first determined @xmath84 from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "then , this dependence was substituted into eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and into the reduced version of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , where the recombination terms due to radiative and nonradiative exciton recombination are omitted .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the curves obtained are very similar to the ones from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . however , there is a difference between the two dependences .",
    "the main difference is that the magnitude of internal yield in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is smaller than in fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial @xmath4 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) at sufficiently small @xmath3 are higher than @xmath85@xmath21 . at the same time , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the maximum of the @xmath72 curve at @xmath64 , and 5ms is below @xmath85@xmath21 .",
    "this means that , in order to increase @xmath72 , one needs to reduce @xmath4 , which is achieved by the reduction of the photogenerated current , i.e. by the reduction of the irradiation intensity .",
    "indeed , for @xmath86ma/@xmath83 we obtain @xmath69% at @xmath70ms .",
    "this agrees with the result from fig .",
    "as shown in this work , the effective density @xmath5 , which determines the nonradiative exciton lifetime in silicon is @xmath87@xmath21 .",
    "our analysis has revealed that the exciton effects in silicon lead to an increase of the internal luminescence quantum yield at sufficiently long shockley - reed - hall lifetimes exceeding 1ms . in the opposite case , @xmath88ms , this effect is absent .",
