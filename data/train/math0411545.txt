    "the phenomenological theory asserts that the evolution of the shape of a droplet of one phase immersed in another phase is governed by the motion by mean curvature .",
    "we are still far from being able to verify this assertion starting from a genuine microscopic dynamics .",
    "very interesting results have been obtained in a series of works in the context of the ising model with ka potentials @xcite . however ,",
    "motion by mean curvature is recovered in some scaling limit where the range of the interactions diverges to infinity : the model becomes somehow close to a mean  field model and the ensuing motion is isotropic . for the true ising model with only nearest ",
    "neighbour interactions , it is expected that an interface between the minus and the plus phase evolves according to an anisotropic motion by mean curvature , that is , each point  @xmath1 of the interface has velocity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the vector normal to the interface at  @xmath1 , @xmath4 is the curvature of the interface at  @xmath1 and @xmath5 is a coefficient depending on the direction of  @xmath6 .",
    "this anisotropy stems from the anisotropy of the cubic lattice .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the zero temperature glauber dynamics for the 2d ising model .",
    "although we do not succeed in deriving the full motion by mean curvature , we manage to compute the initial drift for droplets which approximate suitably smooth domains and we believe this is a crucial step .",
    "four works are directly relevant . in @xcite ,",
    "spohn claims to establish rigorously the mean curvature motion in the context of the 2d ising model at zero temperature for interfaces which can be represented as the graph of a function .",
    "although his results do not apply directly to the case of a full droplet , he succeeds in deriving an explicit formula for the coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "we recover this result here with a different approach .",
    "the computation we present here can be considered to be a refinement of the observation of @xcite .",
    "chayes , schonmann and swindle proved a lifshitz law for the volume of a two - dimensional droplet at zero temperature . instead of looking at the total volume of the droplet , we shall concentrate here on the volume variation of the droplet in a small ball attached to its boundary . in @xcite , by interpreting the interface as a one dimensional exclusion process , chayes and swindle manage to prove that , starting from a square droplet , the evolution of the shape of one corner is described in the hydrodynamical limit by an appropriate stefan problem .",
    "finally , sowers develops in @xcite a framework of geometric measure theory to obtain the hydrodynamical limit .",
    "his convergence theorem is conditional on the verification of several assumptions , some of them concerning the structure of the interface .",
    "it might be that these estimates are the missing pieces to complete the picture .",
    "let us turn now to the description of our result .",
    "we work with the stochastic ising model evolving according to the glauber dynamics at zero temperature .",
    "we consider the diffusive limit where space is rescaled by a factor  @xmath7 and time is speeded up by a factor  @xmath8 .",
    "we start with a plus droplet immersed in the minus phase , whose boundary is a @xmath9 simple jordan curve  @xmath10 : the initial configuration at step  @xmath7 is a suitable approximation of the smooth droplet , drawn on the square lattice @xmath11 .",
    "we consider two cases :    * deterministic initial condition .",
    "* the approximating set at step  @xmath7 consists of the squares of the lattice @xmath11 which intersect the interior of  @xmath10 .",
    "* spohn s initial condition .",
    "* the approximating set at step  @xmath7 is random .",
    "its boundary converges in probability towards  @xmath10 as @xmath7 goes to  @xmath12 and its law  @xmath13 is given by the invariant measure of the associated zero range process .",
    "the droplet is immersed in the minus phase , hence all the sites of the approximating set are initially set to plus , while the other sites of the lattice are set to minus .",
    "we then look at the process @xmath14 and we denote by @xmath15 the plus droplet at time  @xmath16 starting from  @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a point of  @xmath10 .",
    "we study the variation of the magnetization inside the ball @xmath18 centered at @xmath1 with radius @xmath19 , for @xmath19 small .",
    "equivalently , we look at the volume @xmath20 of the plus droplet in this ball and we aim at computing its derivative @xmath21 several problems arise . since the dynamics proceeds by jumps , we have to take the expectation to get a differentiable quantity .",
    "next we wish to link the infinitesimal volume variation with the curvature of the droplet s boundary at  @xmath1 . to achieve this , we need to recover the slope of the continuous curve from its approximation .",
    "we perform a spatial averaging . letting @xmath22",
    "be the two points of @xmath10 which belong to the sphere @xmath23 , we consider the domain @xmath24 and we denote by @xmath25 its discretization at step  @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity of primary interest to link the volume variation and the curvature is @xmath26 let @xmath27 be the angle of the tangent to @xmath10 at  @xmath1 and let @xmath28 be the curvature of @xmath10 at  @xmath1 .",
    "our main result states that , for the deterministic initial condition , @xmath29 in fact , we compute the above limits for a more general class of initial conditions , which includes the two cases above",
    ". the physically relevant case should be the one studied by spohn , it corresponds to the equilibrium state of the zero range process .",
    "this indicates that the limit @xmath30 of any decently converging subsequence of the stochastic motion @xmath31 should satisfy the equation , for any @xmath32 and for any @xmath33 , @xmath34 or at least a weaker variant of it . here",
    "@xmath30 is a random process describing the evolution of the shape of the droplet .",
    "a standard computation shows that the deterministic motion by mean curvature satisfies this equation .",
    "however we do not know whether it is the only solution to this equation ; we have not investigated the corresponding theory so far .",
    "for instance , can one get rid of the expectation ?",
    "anyway , we are still far from establishing that the hydrodynamical limit of the droplet process satisfies the above equation .",
    "an important issue is to control dynamically the proportion of the corners in a microscopic random interface when its average slope is known .",
    "this would probably require some additional probabilistic input .",
    "we consider a zero - temperature 2d - stochastic ising model .",
