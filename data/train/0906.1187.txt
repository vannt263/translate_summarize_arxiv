    "a detailed study shows that there is some degeneracy among the parameters of the propagation model .",
    "this can be used to decrease the size of @xmath81 and thereby reduce the antiproton flux from gravitino decays relative to the flux from spallation @xcite .",

    "these predictions will be tested by the fermi lat results in the near future , thus providing a crucial test of the scenario of decaying gravitino dark matter .",
    "> from the particle physics point of view , the solution to the transport equation depends on the following unknown quantities : the energy spectrum of positrons or antiprotons produced in the decay , the gravitino mass and the gravitino lifetime .",
    "the energy spectrum of positrons and antiprotons depends crucially on the @xmath1-parity breaking interactions of the gravitino .",
    "it was shown in section 2 that when the gravitino mass is large , the branching ratios for the dominant decay channels are predicted to be @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , while the branching ratio for @xmath93 is predicted to be much smaller .",
    "therefore , in this limit the injection spectrum of antiprotons from gravitino decay is fairly model - independent , being just a function of the gravitino mass .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the energy spectrum of positrons , since the flavour composition of the final state depends on the flavour structure of the @xmath1-parity breaking couplings , which can not be predicted without invoking a model of flavour .",
    "the observation by pamela of an excess in the positron fraction at energies extending at least until 100 gev implies a lower bound on the gravitino mass of @xmath94 gev if this positron excess is interpreted in terms of gravitino decays .",
    "besides , as shown in @xcite , there exists a theoretical upper bound on the gravitino mass of @xmath95 gev in supergravity models with universal gaugino masses at the gut scale , stemming from the requirement of successful thermal leptogenesis , yielding a relatively narrow range for the gravitino mass , @xmath96 gev .",
    "if the positron excess observed by pamela is unrelated to gravitino decays , the gravitino mass may be as low as @xmath97 gev without yielding overclosure of the universe @xcite .",

    "a precise knowledge of the secondary flux of antiprotons from spallation of high - energy cosmic rays on the protons and helium nuclei in the interstellar medium is necessary .",

    "is obtained by demanding that the total flux is not larger than the theoretical uncertainty band of the med propagation model .",
    "this means that a ` minimal ' dark matter lifetime for the med model can be defined by a scenario where the secondary antiproton flux from spallation is 25% smaller than the central value , due to a putative overestimation of the nuclear cross sections , and the total antiproton flux saturates the upper limit of the uncertainty band which stems from astrophysical uncertainties discussed above .",
    "this amounts to the requirement that the antiproton flux from gravitino decays should not exceed @xmath108 of the central value of secondary flux from spallation .    using the above prescription",

    "@xcite , thus giving a negligible contribution to the total flux , which is constrained by egret to be @xmath139 at @xmath140gev .",
    "this contribution , however , can be sizable for larger dark matter masses  @xcite . ] for our numerical analysis we shall use the typical branching ratio in this channel derived in section  2 , @xmath141 for gravitino masses in the range from @xmath142  gev . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma - min ] the predicted diffuse gamma - ray flux is shown for @xmath143 and the respective lower bounds ( [ minlife ] ) on the gravitino lifetime .",
    "these spectra correspond to upper bounds on the signal in gamma - rays that can be expected from gravitino dark matter decay .    for comparison",
    ", we show two sets of data points obtained from the egret measurements of the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background using different models of the galactic foreground emission .",
    "an analysis by strong , moskalenko and reimer using a model , optimised to better simulate the galactic diffuse emission , revealed a power law behaviour below 1 gev , with an intriguing deviation from a power law above 1 gev @xcite . for our present analysis",
    ", we shall show both sets of results as the status of the extragalactic background is currently unclear .",
    "for the background obtained by moskalenko , strong and reimer , the extragalactic component is described by the power law @xcite @xmath129_\\text{bg}=6.8\\times 10^{-7 } \\left(\\frac{e}{\\rm gev}\\right)^{-0.32 } ( \\text{cm}^2~\\text{str}~\\text{s})^{-1}~\\text{gev } .\\ ] ] the earlier analysis by sreekumar et al led to a less steep background @xcite , @xmath129_\\text{bg}=1.37\\times 10^{-6 } \\left(\\frac{e}{\\rm gev}\\right)^{-0.1 } ( \\text{cm}^2~\\text{str}~\\text{s})^{-1}~\\text{gev } .\\ ] ] for comparison with the data points , we have averaged the slightly anistropic halo signal over the whole sky , excluding a band of @xmath144 around the galactic disk .",
    "we have conservatively used an energy resolution @xmath145 as quoted by fermi @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that for both choices of the extragalactic background , the antiproton constraint allows for a sizable deviation from a power law background if the gravitino mass is above @xmath146 gev .",
    "therefore , if such a deviation with the proper angular dependence is observed by fermi lat , the scenario of gravitino dark matter will gain support .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a gamma - ray line at the end of the spectrum is predicted , with an intensity that , as discussed in section 2 , depends on the model of @xmath1-parity breaking .",
    "this line could be observed by fermi lat in the diffuse gamma - ray background , but also by the ground - based cherenkov telescopes magic , hess or veritas in galaxies such as m31  @xcite . for smaller gravitino masses",
    "the gamma - ray line becomes more prominent whereas the contribution to the continuous part of the spectrum decreases .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  6 for @xmath127  gev .     and",
    "@xmath126  s. we show both the background obtained by sreekumar et al . as well as the background obtained by strong , moskalenko and reimer .",
    "]    the observation of the discussed features in the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum might , if interpreted as the result of gravitino decay , open the exciting possibility of constraining the reheating temperature of the universe . more concretely",
    ", the thermal relic abundance of gravitinos is given by @xcite @xmath147 therefore , imposing that the thermal abundance of gravitinos should not be larger that the total dark matter abundance , the measurement of the gravitino mass by fermi lat and the measurement of the gluino mass at the lhc imply the following upper bound on the reheating temperature of the universe : @xmath148 which is saturated when all the dark matter gravitinos are of thermal origin .",
    "this bound has impoprtant implications for the scenario of thermal leptogenesis , which requires @xmath149 gev , as well as for many inflationary scenarios .",
    "in supersymmetric theories with small @xmath1-parity breaking thermally produced gravitinos can account for the observed dark matter , consistent with leptogenesis and nucleosynthesis .",
    "gravitino decays then contribute to antimatter cosmic rays as well as gamma - rays .",
    "we consider gravitino masses below 600  gev , which are consistent with universal boundary conditions at the gut scale .",
    "gravitino decays into standard model particles can be studied in a model - independent way by means of an operator analysis . for sufficiently large gravitino masses the dimension-5 operator dominates .",
    "this means that the branching ratios into @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath116 are fixed , except for the dependence on lepton flavour . as a consequence",
    ", the gamma - ray flux is essentially determined once the antiproton flux is known . on the contrary , the positron flux is model - dependent .",
    "the gamma - ray line is controlled by the dimension-6 operator .",
    "hence , it is suppressed compared to the continuous gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "its strength is model - dependent and decreases with increasing gravitino mass .",
    "electron and positron fluxes from gravitino decays , together with the standard galprop background , can not account for both , the pamela positron fraction and the electron @xmath0 positron flux measured by fermi lat .",
    "for gravitino dark matter , the observed fluxes require astrophysical sources .",
    "however , depending on the gravitino mass and the background , the dark matter contribution to the electron and positron fluxes can be non - negligable .",
    "present data on charged cosmic rays allow for a sizable contribution of gravitino dark matter to the gamma - ray spectrum , in particular a line at an energy below 300  gev .",
    "non - observation of such a line would place an upper bound on the gravitino lifetime , and therefore on the strength of @xmath1-parity breaking , restricting possible signatures at the lhc .",
    "we would like to thank l. covi , d. horns , g. sigl and c. weniger for useful discussions .",
