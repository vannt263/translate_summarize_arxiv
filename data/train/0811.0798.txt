    "the dynamics and pinning of vortices in type - ii superconductors is arguably one of the most widely investigated phenomena in the field of superconductivity . recently",
    ", particular attention has been devoted to the possibility of controlling the strength of the vortex pinning using different magnetic templates@xcite . within the london formalism , the interaction between a vortex line and a finite size permanent magnet",
    "is given by@xcite ,    @xmath0    where the integration is carried out over the volume of the ferromagnet , @xmath1 indicates the position of the vortex line , @xmath2 its spatial dependent magnetic moment , and @xmath3 is the field generated by the vortex line .",
    "this equation shows that the pinning potential not only depends on the size of the dots@xcite but also on their exact magnetic state@xcite .",
    "in particular , if the superconducting penetration depth @xmath4 is on the order of the lateral size of the dot , a weak average pinning is expected when the magnetic dot contains multiple domains .",
    "in contrast to that , a maximum pinning should be achieved for single domain structures . in order to retain these properties in big arrays of magnetic particles",
    "it is necessary to ensure a minimum distance between them in such a way that the field profiles of neighboring elements do not overlap and can be resolved at scales of the magnetic penetration length @xmath4 .",
    "notice that according to eq.([uvm - dot ] ) it is possible to increase strongly the pinning by just growing continuously the magnetic moment of the dots .",
    "this growth is limited by the fact that above certain magnetic moment , a vortex - antivortex pair will be induced by the magnetic element with the consequent change in the pinning properties@xcite .",
    "for instance , dots with perpendicular magnetic moment induce a vortex on top of the dots whereas the accompanying antivortex is located at interstitial positions , in between the dots . as a result",
    ", vortices and antivortices feel a different pinning potential which leads to a distinct dynamic response@xcite .",
    "since the weakly pinned interstitial antivortices limit the maximum critical current @xmath5 , their annihilation with an external field produces a shift of the field position of the @xmath5 towards @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of vortex - antivortex pairs generated by a single magnetic element and @xmath8 is the field corresponding to one external vortex per unit cell . since @xmath8 is a geometrically predefined parameter , the field loci of the @xmath5 is a direct measurement of the number @xmath7 of bounded pairs .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of micromagnets with in - plane magnetic moment , the field polarity symmetry of the system conceals this information from dc electro - transport experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce alternative methods to accurately determine the number @xmath7 of vortex - antivortex pairs induced by the magnetic template , based on the ac - dynamic response of the hybrid system .",
    "indeed , the fact that the critical force to bring the vortex and antivortex closer differs from that necessary to pull them apart@xcite , gives rise to a clear rectification effect when the system is submitted to a zero average ac - signal .",
    "this rectified voltage is maximum at zero external field@xcite and progressively decreases with increasing field until all vortices ( or antivortices ) are compensated . at rf frequencies the mode locking or synchronized motion of vortices produces distinct voltage steps in the current - voltage characteristics with separation determined by the number of moving vortices .",
    "both techniques indicate that for the particular system here investigated , the magnetic template generates one single vortex - antivortex pair per unit cell .    the crucial conditions for the success of these methods are ( i ) a periodic landscape , i.e. all vortices and antivortices feeling the same environment , and ( ii ) a free flux flow motion of vortices .",
    "although the predefined topological landscape is by definition periodic , the magnetic landscape for the as - grown state consists of a highly disorder distribution of magnetic poles .",
    "this disordered state can be switched to a perfectly ordered magnetic lattice by magnetizing the sample with an in - plane field .",
    "the order - disorder transition , already reported for other s / f systems@xcite , produces a profound modification in the vortex dynamics .",
    "more specifically , in the disordered state , non - linear current - voltage characteristics with high critical currents are observed , whereas a very broad flux flow regime accompanied by a sharp decrease of the critical currents is obtained in the ordered state .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to the reduction of the average hopping distance determined by the separation between neighboring magnetic poles of identical polarity .",
    "in addition , the presence of a flux flow regime at zero applied field reinforces the idea that the investigated magnetic structure is able to induce vortex - antivortex ( v - av ) pairs .",
    "the sample investigated consists of a periodic array of permalloy ( ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 ) equilateral triangles of 1 @xmath11 m side and a thickness of 25 nm .",
    "along one of the principal directions of the array ( @xmath12-axis ) the separation between the triangles is 1 @xmath11 m whereas in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath13-axis ) the triangles are touching [ see fig .  [ fig - sample](a ) ] .",
    "this geometry gives rise to two well defined directions of the structure , parallel ( @xmath13 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath12 ) to the line connecting nearby triangles , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - sample](a ) .",
    "a 50 nm thick superconducting al bridge deposited on top of the magnetic template also covers the unpatterned substrate [ see fig .  [ fig - sample](b ) ] thus allowing us to compare directly patterned vs reference plain film and identify the influence of the magnetic triangles on the superconductor .",
    "both , the array of triangles and the transport bridge are aligned at submicrometer scale and were prepared by standard lithographic techniques .",
    "the al plain film has a critical temperature at zero field @xmath14 k , with residual resistivity ratio @xmath15k@xmath16k@xmath17 , and superconducting coherence length @xmath18(0)@xmath19 nm .",
    "it is a crucial point that neighboring triangles overlap in one direction in order to eventually achieve two well distinguished phases : disordered in the as - grown state and ordered in the magnetized state . indeed , magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) images shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sample](c ) for non touching triangles demonstrate that the remanent state , irrespective of the magnetic history of the triangles , is always a vortex state , in agreement with previous reports on individual micrometer size magnetic structures@xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , if there is a physical contact between neighboring triangles a new set of possible states can be found .",
    "[ fig - sample](d ) shows a mfm image of the sample investigated in the as - grown state . here a clearly disordered arrangement of the , so called , buckle states@xcite is observed .",
    "interestingly , after magnetizing the sample with an homogeneous in - plane field perpendicular to the chain of triangles [ fig .",
    "[ fig - sample](e ) ] , these buckle states can be set in a perfectly ordered arrangement .",
    "the in - plane distribution of magnetic moments calculated by oommf micromagnetic simulations@xcite is indicated in fig .",

    "[ fig - sample](g ) . in all cases the magnetic state of each triangle",
    "is characterized by a strong out of plane magnetic pole which is located at one of the two bottom corners of the py triangles and a weaker magnetic pole , with opposite polarity , located at the top corner of the triangle [ fig .",
    "[ fig - sample](e ) ] .",
    "it is precisely this magnetic pole which can be controlled to lie on either side of the triangle by simply changing the direction of magnetization .",
    "notice that this magnetic monopole - like structure breaks the field polarity symmetry of the s / f hybrid system .",
    "the question now arises as whether the distribution of the magnetic dipoles ( ordered versus disordered ) has any effect on the properties of the adjacent superconducting film .",
    "let us first analyze the nucleation of the superconducting order parameter for the two different magnetic states of the hybrid system .",
    "[ fig - phaseboundary ] summarizes the obtained superconductor / normal metal phase boundaries for a dc - current of 100 @xmath11a and using 90@xmath22 criterion of the normal state resistance @xmath23 for different magnetic states and current orientations .",
    "higher criteria exhibit similar results . for the as - grown state ( open circles ) a pronounced decrease of the critical temperature at low fields with respect to the plain film is observed . a further suppression of @xmath24 is obtained after the sample has been magnetized with an in - plane field parallel to the @xmath12 direction ( solid triangles ) .",
    "the fact that the phase boundary of the as - grown state lies in between those corresponding to the plain film and the fully polarized buckle state , suggests that in the virgin sample , randomly oriented buckle states coexist with magnetic vortex states .",
    "this has been indeed confirmed by the mfm images taken at different locations of the pattern .",

    "this behavior can be ascribed to the change of dimensionality when @xmath26 exceeds the size @xmath27 of the regions where superconductivity first nucleates . within this regime",
    "the phase boundary can be approximated by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . by using this expression to fit the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - phaseboundary ] ( solid line ) we found @xmath30 @xmath11 m which is consistent with the largest separation between neighboring magnetic poles .",
    "this behavior suggests that for the magnetized sample the stray fields confine the superconducting condensate in between the magnetic poles and consequently the superconducting order parameter will be modulated into a sequence of quasi one - dimensional stripes .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with complementary transport measurements for two orthogonal orientations of the applied current , perpendicular to the chain of triangles ( solid triangular symbols ) and parallel to them ( open triangular symbols ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - phaseboundary ] indicating that the onset of superconductivity is independent on the direction of the applied current .",
    "in the previous section we showed that by switching from the as - grown ( disordered phase ) to the magnetized ( ordered phase ) state , a proliferation of magnetic poles takes place which in turn gives rise to a decrease of @xmath31 . in addition , the dimensional crossover from a 2d disordered phase to a 1d ordered phase has little or no influence on the nucleation temperature .",
    "however , deeper into the superconducting state where the electric response is dominated by the vortex dynamics , the one dimensional nature of the field modulation should become more apparent .    in order to address this issue",
    "we have measured the voltage - current characteristics [ @xmath32 with the bias current applied in the @xmath12-direction at @xmath33 and @xmath34 k for the two different magnetic states : as - grown ( open circles ) and magnetized ( solid squares ) states as shown in fig .",
    "[ vi ] ( a ) .",
    "the most obvious feature in this figure is the enormous difference ( more than an order of magnitude ) between the critical current of the magnetized state ( 24 @xmath11a ) with respect to the demagnetized state ( 490 @xmath11a ) .",
    "furthermore , the vortex dynamics is severely modified after magnetizing the sample . indeed , whereas in the as - grown state there is a narrow window of currents exhibiting a highly non - linear @xmath35 dependence , where the vortex lattice transit from pinned phase to the normal state , in the magnetized sample a broad flux - flow regime is observed immediately above the critical current . fig .",
    "[ vi](b ) and ( c ) summarize the field dependence of the different dynamical phases for the as grown sample [ panel ( b ) ] and after magnetization [ panel ( c ) ] .",

    "instead , the observed difference between both phases can be attributed to the formation of easily moving channels of vortices and antivortices created by the magnetic structure .",
    "indeed , in the ordered phase the potential wells created by the magnetic dipoles are perfectly aligned and strongly overlap , thus creating an easy channel for flux motion .",
    "in contrast to that , in the disordered phase , the average distance between two neighboring magnetic pinning centers of equal polarity is larger thus impeding the easy motion of vortices . from now on we will focus on the dynamic response of the system in the ordered state .",
    "a rough criterion to determine whether the stray field emanating from the magnetic structure is strong enough to induce v - av pairs can be obtained by comparing it to the penetration field @xmath38 resulting from bean - livingston barriers@xcite .",
    "the highest barrier possible is limited by the thermodynamic critical field @xmath39 . using @xmath40 nm and @xmath41",
    "nm we obtain @xmath42 mt which lies well below the field intensity ( @xmath43 100 mt ) produced by the magnetic template at the superconducting film . based on this estimation we can safely conclude that the magnetic structure is able to induce , at least , one vortex - antivortex per unit cell .",
    "red ( green ) circles represent positive ( negative ) vortices .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this finding suggests that the ordered phase consists of two well defined channels with opposite vortex polarity as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ schematics](a ) . since the magnetic template breaks the field polarity symmetry , in principle vortices and antivortices should experience a different depinning current .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematics](b ) , under these circumstances an external field will compensate vortices in the channel with opposite polarity ( thus introducing disorder in this particular channel and increasing the average hopping distance ) and as a result the high vortex mobility will be suppressed .",

    "this scenario predicts two anomalous behaviors : the existence of a flux - flow response at zero field and a field independent flux flow regime as long as none of the two rows of vortices is fully compensated by the external field .",

    "this figure shows a strong in - plane anisotropy @xmath49 induced by the magnetic template which results from the easier motion of vortices along the line of magnetic poles than perpendicular to them .",
    "this anisotropy amounts to a factor of 5 at non matching fields and is minimum at the commensurability fields .",
    "the scenario described in the previous section where rows of vortices and antivortices generated by the magnetic template coexist , makes our system similar to the array of elongated magnetic bars studied by de souza silva _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this system has been modeled within the london approximation by carneiro@xcite for the case where no v - av pairs are induced , and more recently by lima and de souza silva@xcite assuming that v - av pairs emanate from the dipoles .",
    "irrespective of whether the magnetic template is able to induce v - av pairs or not , both situations lead to a rectification of the net vortex motion @xmath50 when a zero average ac - force is applied parallel to the dipolar moment ( i.e. along the line connecting a vortex with its corresponding antivortex)@xcite .",
    "however , clear differences in the field dependence of the average velocity are expected . indeed ,",
    "if v - av pairs are present then ( i ) a maximum rectification is expected at zero field , ( ii ) unlike standard ratchet signal , the sign of the average voltage readout should be field polarity independent , ( iii ) as vortices ( antivortices ) are progressively compensated by increasing the external negative ( positive ) field , the rectified signal should decrease .     in the temperature - field @xmath51 plane for the magnetized sample subjected to a 1 khz sinusoidal",

    "furthermore , if the applied field is increased above the first matching field a sign reversal occurs .",
    "this sign reversal at @xmath8 can not be explained assuming more than one v - av pair created by the magnetic template since in this case the v - av annihilation process would be unlikely interrupted by the partial compensation of one row of vortices .",
    "in contrast to that , if there is a single v - av pair per unit cell , once a whole line is compensated by the external field , a dramatic change in the rectification properties is expected . although this finding seems to indicate that the magnetic structure is able to induce a single v - av per triangular element , a more convincing evidence of this prediction can be obtained only by monitoring the individual motion of vortices at higher frequencies .",
    "the motion of vortices in a periodic potential gives rise to a variety of interesting dynamical effects such as the generation of rf radiation@xcite and synchronization / resonance effects of the vortex lattice@xcite when a rf current @xmath52 is superimposed onto a dc drive @xmath53 .",
    "the latter effect gives rise to a series of plateaus in the @xmath35 measurements very similar to the shapiro steps observed in joshepson junctions@xcite .",

    "<S> the vortex dynamics in a low temperature superconductor deposited on top of a rectangular array of micrometer size permalloy triangles is investigated experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the rectangular unit cell is such that neighboring triangles physically touch each other along one direction . </S>",
    "<S> this design stabilizes remanent states which differ from the magnetic vortex state typical of individual non - interacting triangles . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic force microscopy images have revealed that the magnetic landscape of the template can be switched to an ordered configuration after magnetizing the sample with an in - plane field . </S>",
    "<S> the ordered phase exhibits a broad flux flow regime with relatively low critical current and a highly anisotropic response . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is caused by the spontaneous formation of two separated rows of vortices and antivortices along each line of connected triangles . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a clear flux flow regime even for zero external field supports this interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the density of induced vortex - antivortex pairs is directly obtained using a high frequency measurement technique which allows us to resolve the discrete motion of vortices . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the presence of vortex - antivortex rows gives rise to a self organized synchronized motion of vortices which manifests itself as field independent shapiro steps in the current - voltage characteristics . </S>"
