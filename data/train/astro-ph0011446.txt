    "since the dawn of evolutionary cosmology , great efforts toward understanding the formation of the first structures have been made by many authors ( e.g. , saslaw & zipoy 1967 ; peebles & dicke 1968 ; matsuda , sato , & takeda 1969 ; doroshkevich & kolesnik 1976 ; carlberg 1981 ; palla , salpeter , & stahler 1983 ; kashlinsky & rees 1983 ) . in particular , partly stimulated by observational advances and by the consequent detectability of the first stars by next - generation facilities , this area is being vigorously investigated these days ( e.g. , haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ; yamada & nishi 1998 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ; fuller & couchman 2000 ) .",
    "those studies have repeatedly emphasized the key role played by molecular hydrogen .",
    "the role of h@xmath3 in the cosmological context is twofold .",
    "first , small primordial clouds whose virial temperature is @xmath4 can cool and start collapsing via h@xmath3 line cooling after virialization ( e.g. , haiman et al . 1996 ) .",
    "second , the jeans mass inside a collapsing primordial cloud is eventually reduced to much less than a solar mass as a result of h@xmath3 cooling ( e.g. , palla et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "regarding the former role , there is some dispute over the role of h@xmath3 in the formation of second - generation stars , namely , what happens after the first stars have formed by h@xmath3 cooling . formed first stars or first quasars",
    "can be sources of uv radiation .",
    "whereas ionizing photons are trapped in an hii region around the source , far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; @xmath5 ev ) photons travel farther and form an outer h@xmath3 photodissociation region ( pdr ) .",
    "therefore , before the overlap of the hii regions , or in other words the reionization of the universe , the h@xmath3 pdrs must cover the whole intergalactic space . at that time , the universe is filled with fuv background radiation ( e.g. , haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; ciardi , ferrara , & abel 2000 ) .",
    "hydrogen molecules in small objects can easily be photodissociated by either internal or external uv sources .",
    "haiman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that in the presence of uv background radiation at the level needed to reionize the universe , molecular hydrogen is photodissociated in small cosmological objects .",
    "furthermore , omukai & nishi ( 1999 ) pointed out that even a single o star formed in a small cosmological object is able to photodissociate the whole original cloud .",
    "in addition , those clouds are easily blown out by a few supernovae because of their shallow potential wells ( e.g. , mac low & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "these effects strongly regulate the subsequent star formation within small pregalactic clouds .",
    "in contrast to this , the temperature of sufficiently massive clouds reaches above @xmath68000k , where atomic ly@xmath7 emission begins to be an effective cooling agent .",
    "regardless of the h@xmath3 photodissociation , such clouds can start collapsing dynamically .",
    "it is frequently assumed that , even in primordial clouds that cool by the atomic cooling instead of the h@xmath3 one , star formation occurs in the same way as in those with the h@xmath3 cooling .",
    "however , it is far from evident .",
    "recall another role of hydrogen molecules in primordial star formation .",
    "the formation of protostars in primordial clouds with h@xmath3 cooling has been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , matsuda et al .",
    "1969 ; yoneyama 1972 ; carlberg 1981 ; palla et al . 1983",
    "; omukai & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "it is known that those clouds cool by h@xmath3 rovibrational line emission ( for number density @xmath8 ) , h@xmath3 collision - induced emission ( for @xmath9 ) , and the h@xmath3 dissociation ( for @xmath10 ) . eventually , a very small protostar ( @xmath11 ) forms at the center when @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , we know little about the later evolution of clouds that start collapsing via atomic cooling .",
    "it is still unclear under what condition h@xmath3 eventually forms , or whether it plays some role as a coolant in such clouds .",
    "it is also not known how small a jeans mass is reached through atomic cooling alone .",
    "if this value falls well beyond the mass of normal stars ( for example if it corresponds to the size of super massive stars or very massive objects ) , we must conclude that normal stars does not form only by atomic cooling .",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer these questions .    in this paper",
    ", we study the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial clouds irradiated with fuv radiation .",
    "thereby , we demonstrate that the jeans mass inside the clouds is reduced to much less than a solar mass even in the absence of molecular cooling .",
    "this implies that low - mass primordial star formation is possible even without h@xmath3 if fragmentation of the clouds occurs at sufficiently high density .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 , the method of our calculations is described . in  3 ,",
    "results of our calculations are presented .",
    "finally , our work is summarized and its implications sketched briefly in  4 .",
    "we consider spherical clouds of hydrogen - helium gas irradiated with fuv radiation .",
    "specifically , we investigate the cases of two fuv spectra in this paper : type _ a _ , the power - law radiation @xmath13 and type _ b _ , the diluted thermal radiation of @xmath14 k @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lyman limit frequency . in both cases , @xmath17 beyond the lyman limit .",
    "we neglect the so - called sawtooth modulation due to the absorption of lyman series photons by the intergalactic matter ( e.g. , haiman et al . 1997 ) , for simplicity .",
    "this suffices for our simple analysis , which is valid only in order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "we also include the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , although it has little influence on the matter at those low redshifts .",
    "the spectra of fuv radiation are shown in figure 1 for @xmath18 along with the cmbr at @xmath19 .",
    "note that , for the same value of intensity at the lyman limit , the number of photons above the threshold of h@xmath1 photodissociation is larger for type _",
    "_ spectra than for type _ a _ spectra .",
    "consequently , the photodissociation rate of h@xmath1 is about 250 times larger for the @xmath20 k thermal type radiation ( type _ b _ ) than for the power - law type ( type _ a _ ) with the same value of @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , the photodissociation rate of h@xmath3 is about 3 times larger for the type _",
    "b _ spectrum .",
    "we take the maximum expansion of an overdensity as the initial condition of the calculation . assuming the redshift of that epoch @xmath22",
    ", we take the number density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath23 $ ] , ionization degree @xmath24 , and matter temperature @xmath25 at the maximum expansion epoch as @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we neglect the initial molecular abundance and assume @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the concentration of helium nuclei , and @xmath29 is the mass of a hydrogen nucleus . note that the concentration of he is defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the number density of hydrogen nuclei and helium nuclei , respectively .",
    "simultaneously , we write for each atomic , molecular , or ionic species , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number density of species @xmath35 . note @xmath36 for fully molecular gas .",
    "we set the primordial helium abundance at @xmath37 , which corresponds to the mass fraction @xmath38 ( izotov & thuan 1998 ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "any effect due to rotation or magnetic fields are neglected for simplicity .",
    "then , the actual collapse is expected to proceed like the penston - larson similarity solution ( penston 1969 ; larson 1969 ) . according to this solution ,",
    "the cloud consists of two parts , that is , a central core region and an envelope .",
    "the central core region has a flat density distribution , whereas in the envelope , the density decreases outward as @xmath41 .",
    "the size of the central flat region is roughly given by the local jeans length @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the sound speed and total density in the core , respectively . in this paper , we take the radius of the central region as @xmath45 . the collapse in the core proceeds approximately at the free - fall rate . in this paper , we focus on the evolution in the central region .",
    "in particular , we calculate the the temperature and chemical composition of the collapsing core as a function of the central density .",
    "the cloud consists of two components , namely , baryon and dark matter .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the baryonic component is described by the relation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the baryonic density in the central region and the free - fall time is @xmath48    the dynamics of the dark matter is described by the relation for the top - hat overdensity , @xmath49 up to the virialization , where the maximum expansion redshift @xmath50 , and the parameter @xmath51 is related to @xmath52 by the relation @xmath53 ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "we also use the usual age - redshift relation for the matter dominant universe , @xmath54 . after the virialization of dark matter ,",
    "i.e. , when the density reaches to the virial density @xmath55 , we keep @xmath56 .    the thermal evolution is followed by solving the energy equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the internal energy per unit mass of baryon",
    ", @xmath59 is the pressure for an ideal gas , @xmath60 is the adiabatic exponent , @xmath61 is the temperature , @xmath62 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath29 is the mass of a hydrogen nucleus , and @xmath63 is the net cooling rate per unit volume .",
    "the net cooling rate @xmath63 consists of contributions from radiative cooling or heating by atomic hydrogen lines @xmath64 ; by rovibrational lines of molecular hydrogen , @xmath65 ; by continuum , @xmath66 ; and by the compton coupling with the radiation , @xmath67 ( the compton cooling is unimportant in those low redshifts although it is included in our calculation ) and from heating and cooling associated with chemical reactions , @xmath68 : @xmath69 the continuum processes included are listed in table 1 .",
    "the details of these processes are described in appendix b. since we are focusing on the evolution of the central region , whose radius @xmath70 , then we evaluate the optical depth @xmath71 by @xmath72    time - dependent nonequilibrium chemical reactions are solved for the following nine species : h , h@xmath73 , @xmath74 , h@xmath75 , h@xmath76 , h@xmath1 , he , he@xmath75 , and he@xmath77 .",
    "chemical reactions included are listed in table 2 .",
    "in this section , we present our numerical results . figures 2 and 3 display the temperature evolution for collapsing primordial clouds irradiated with ( 1 ) the power - law type and ( 2 ) diluted black body of @xmath14 k type fuv radiation , respectively . as mentioned in  2 , the photodissociation rate coefficients of both h@xmath1 and h@xmath3 are larger for type _",
    "b _ spectrum than for the type _ a _ with the same value of @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , fuv radiation of type _ b _ has the larger influence on the evolution of the clouds than type _ a _ with the same value of @xmath21 .",
    "we discuss effects of different spectral types and scaling relations between them in appendix a. except for those scalings of @xmath21 , the evolutionary trajectories change in similar ways with an increase of the uv intensity in both cases .",
    "hence , we describe only the evolutionary features of the clouds irradiated with type _ a _ radiation in detail here .",
    "the evolutionary trajectories for the clouds with @xmath78 are identical to each other .",
    "as is obvious from figure 2 , the thermal evolution at high densities ( say , @xmath79 ) is completely different between clouds with @xmath80 and those with @xmath78 .",
    "this is because the clouds irradiated by the fuv radiation with @xmath81 can not form sufficient @xmath82 , so they cool only by atomic cooling .",
    "the temperature of such clouds is higher than that of clouds with @xmath83 , which can form enough @xmath82 to cool eventually . toward higher densities , these two groups of trajectories in figure 1 converge respectively to two different limiting tracks .",
    "we call the higher temperature one the `` atomic cooling track '' , and the other the `` molecular cooling track '' .",
    "this nomenclature comes from the fact that clouds evolving along the former track remain atomic , while those following the latter eventually become fully molecular .",
    "we should note that the jeans masses inside the clouds ultimately fall below @xmath84 for both tracks .",
    "figure 4 shows the fractional abundances of hydrogen molecules ( fig.4_a _ ) and electrons ( fig.4_b _ ) for the clouds irradiated with type _ a _ radiation .",
    "the separate heating and cooling rates per unit mass for those clouds are illustrated in the panels of figure 5 for @xmath85(fig.5_a _ ) , @xmath14(fig.5_b _ ) and @xmath86(fig.5_c _ ) .",
    "we review their evolutionary features starting from the case of @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", the collapse proceeds along the well - known molecular cooling track ( e.g. , palla et al . 1983 ) . at the beginning ,",
    "the temperature rises adiabatically owing to the compression and the initial lack of coolant .",
    "if the total mass of the cloud is less than the maximum jeans mass attained at the end of this adiabatic phase , the contraction stops at the time when the cloud mass becomes equal to the jeans mass .",
    "we assume here that the total mass of the cloud is larger than the maximum jeans mass . at low densities ( i.e. , @xmath87 )",
    ", h@xmath3 is formed mainly through the h@xmath1 channel : @xmath88 and then @xmath89 increased temperature and density causes an increase of both the h@xmath3 formation rate and the h@xmath3 cooling function . consequently , a sufficient amount of h@xmath3 to cool within a free - fall time is formed , and the temperature then drops .",
    "a detailed discussion of when the efficient h@xmath3 cooling begins is presented in appendix a. owing to the h@xmath3 cooling , the temperature is kept as low as a few hundred k in the cloud ( see fig.2 and fig.5_a _ ) .",
    "when the density reaches about @xmath90 , the three - body reaction @xmath91 becomes efficient ( palla et al .",
    "1983 ) . in consequence of this highly productive h@xmath3 formation",
    ", hydrogen becomes fully molecular ( see fig.4 _ a _ ) . at the same time , the cloud becomes optically thick to a few h@xmath3 lines at @xmath92 .",
    "however , the cooling remains efficient enough to induce dynamical collapse ( i.e. , the ratio of specific heat @xmath93 ) because there are still enough optically thin lines .",
    "when the central number density reaches about @xmath94 , h@xmath3 collision - induced emission begins to dominate the cooling ( see fig.5_a _ ) .",
    "the cloud becomes optically thick to this continuum at @xmath95 .",
    "thereafter , the radiative cooling rate drops rapidly .",
    "simultaneously , h@xmath3 dissociation begins , because the temperature is already near the value needed for dissociation .",
    "the h@xmath3 dissociation prevents the temperature from rising rapidly until the number density reaches about @xmath96 .",
    "the minimum jeans mass of @xmath97 is reached shortly after that .",
    "when most of the hydrogen molecules are dissociated , the collapse becomes approximately adiabatic . according to omukai & nishi ( 1998 ) , after a little further contraction , a small hydrostatic core ( about a few @xmath98 ) , or protostar , forms at @xmath99k .    as seen in figure 2 , if the intensity of fuv radiation increases , the density and temperature at the time when efficient h@xmath3 cooling begins also increases ( see appendix a for further discussion ) .",
    "after h@xmath3 cooling becomes effective , the trajectories of those clouds soon converge to the evolutionary track for @xmath17 .",
    "an interesting example is when the intensity is as high as @xmath100 . in this case ,",
    "the temperature rises almost adiabatically up to about 8000k without enough h@xmath3 formation . at that point",
    ", ly@xmath7 line emission of atomic hydrogen begins to work as an efficient cooling agent ( see fig.5_b _ ) .",
    "after the cloud collapses isothermally at @xmath101k over an order of magnitude in density owing to this coolant , sufficient hydrogen molecules form as a result of the increased density .",
    "thereafter , the trajectory converges rapidly to the molecular cooling track in the same way as those with weaker radiation ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "when the intensity of fuv radiation is increased more , i.e. , @xmath102 , the thermal evolution becomes completely different from those with lower intensities ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the adiabatic rise of temperature continues until ly@xmath7 cooling becomes effective at about 8000k .",
    "this effect has little influence on the later evolution .",
    "] while the cloud collapses nearly isothermally at about 8000k owing to ly@xmath7 line cooling , the central density reaches the critical density are populated , according to the lte law .",
    "] @xmath103 of hydrogen molecules before a amount of h@xmath3 sufficient to cool within a free - fall time forms . at higher densities , @xmath104 ,",
    "enough h@xmath3 never forms , for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the h@xmath3 fraction decreases ; the collisional dissociation rate coefficient increases because , at @xmath104 , high vibrational levels , at which dissociation occurs easily , are populated by more hydrogen molecules than at lower density .",
    "second , the amount of h@xmath3 needed for efficient cooling increases ; note that the cooling rate per unit volume @xmath105 for @xmath106 , while @xmath107 for @xmath104 .",
    "( see appendix a for further discussion ) .",
    "consequently , the cloud never joins to the molecular cooling track .",
    "instead , it continues to cool by ly@xmath7 line emission until the density reaches about @xmath108 , where collisional de - excitation from the @xmath109 state begins to dominate the ly@xmath7 emission as a result of the small escape probability ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) .",
    "the subsequent major cooling process is two - photon emission of atomic hydrogen from the @xmath111 state .",
    "this works effectively in the density range @xmath112 .",
    "next , the cloud cools by the free - bound emission of @xmath113 over nearly ten orders of magnitude in density , until the number density reaches @xmath114 ( see fig.5 _ c _ ) .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath113 free - bound emission cooling is as follows . as a first step , radiative association of h and @xmath74 ; @xmath115 occurs and a photon is emitted .",
    "this @xmath113 is used to form h@xmath3 ( reaction 9 ) , which will be collisionally dissociated by reaction 15 . as a result",
    ", there is net cooing by the photon emitted in reaction 32 .",

    "( @xmath117 for type _",
    "respectively ) spectrum . in this case",
    ", there is no net cooling . ] in the course of the dynamical collapse induced by h@xmath1 free - bound emission , the temperature falls gradually from 7000k ( at @xmath118 ) to 3000k ( at @xmath119 ; see fig .",
    "2 ) . at the central density , @xmath120 ,",
    "the cloud becomes optically thick to both h@xmath1 bound - free absorption and rayleigh scattering of atomic hydrogen . at the number density @xmath121 , the h ionization begins ( see fig .",
    "4 b ) . as a result ,",
    "the temperature rise slows down up to @xmath122 . at @xmath123 , where 60 % of the gas is ionized",
    ", the minimum jeans mass @xmath124 is reached .",
    "thereafter , the temperature continues to rise almost adiabatically .",
    "we expect that a protostar on the order of @xmath125 is formed after a little further adiabatic contraction .",
    "although the minimum jeans mass of the atomic cooling clouds is 20 times larger than that of the h@xmath3 cooling clouds , it is still much less than the mass of usual stars .",
    "we have investigated the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial clouds irradiated with fuv radiation .",
    "when intensity of the irradiating fuv radiation exceeds some critical value [ @xmath126 for @xmath127 , sufficient molecular hydrogen to be important for cooling is never formed in those clouds because of the photodissociation and blocking of the formation channel .",
    "nonetheless , sufficiently massive clouds can start dynamical collapse by atomic line cooling even without h@xmath3 .",
    "those clouds continue to collapse almost isothermally at several thousand k along the `` atomic cooling track '' in the density - temperature plane .",
    "that dynamical collapse is induced by successive cooling by ly@xmath7 emission , two - photon emission , and h@xmath1 free - bound emission .",
    "the minimum jeans mass eventually reduces to about @xmath128 for those clouds . on the other hand , clouds irradiated with less intense fuv radiation collapse dynamically by the h@xmath3 cooling .",
    "the minimum jeans mass of such clouds is about @xmath129 .",
    "although in this paper we limited our application to the protostellar collapse under an fuv background , we expect that the primordial protostellar collapse without h@xmath3 also occurs in other situations .",
    "recently , susa & kitayama ( 2000 ) investigated the collapse of primordial clouds irradiated with ionizing uv background @xmath130 .",
    "they pointed out that h@xmath3 formation is suppressed for @xmath131 owing to blocking of the h@xmath3 formation channel by h@xmath1 photodissociation .",
    "although they did not study the later evolution , we guess that the clouds continue collapsing along our atomic cooling track .",
    "carlberg ( 1981 ) also considered the thermal evolution of collapsing primordial clouds without external radiation , but he did not include the three - body process of @xmath82 formation .",
    "for this reason , in his calculation , molecular hydrogen dissociates at @xmath132 .",
    "after that , the evolutionary path of his cloud follows approximately our atomic cooling track ( see fig . 2 of carlberg 1981 ) .",
    "this fact support our speculation that the clouds that do not cool by h@xmath3 collapse along the atomic cooling track .",
    "next , we discuss the feasibility of the collapse along the atomic cooling track in the cosmological reionization .",
    "the uv intensity needed to reionize the universe at @xmath133 , i.e. , 1 ionizing photon per a hydrogen nucleus , is @xmath134 at the lyman limit for @xmath135 and the assumed cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , the condition that the clouds collapse along the atomic cooling track , @xmath102 for @xmath136 , seems to be rarely met in practice , except in the immediate vicinity of uv sources .",
    "finally , we discuss the mass of formed stars .",
    "although the minimum jeans mass is less than 0.1 @xmath137 , this corresponds not to the final mass of formed stars , but rather to the initial mass of the protostar , which has no direct relation with the former .",
    "when a small hydrostatic core , namely protostar , forms at the center of a collapsing protostellar cloud , an enormous amount of gravitationally unstable gas still surrounds the protostar .",
    "thereafter , the protostar grows in mass by accreting the ambient matter .",
    "consequently , the final mass of stars is determined by the subsequent accretion onto the protostar .",
    "stahler , shu , & taam ( 1980 ) argued that a rough estimate of the protostellar mass accretion rate @xmath138 can be obtained from the relation @xmath139 , where @xmath43 is the isothermal sound speed in the protostellar cloud . from this relation ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is higher for protostars formed by atomic cooling than for those formed by molecular cooling because of the higher temperature of the protostellar cloud .",
    "suppose that the accretion is halted by some stellar activity , e.g. , radiation force , bipolar flow , etc .",
    "in this case , the higher accretion rate probably results in the later halting and higher mass of formed stars ( e.g. , wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) .    in contrast , from the viewpoint of fragmentation , the masses of primordial stars formed by atomic cooling alone could be smaller than those formed by molecular cooling .",
    "the fragmentation is possible in principle as long as the temperature decreases toward higher density , while it does not occur after the isothermality of the cloud breaks down and the temperature begins to rise ( inutsuka & miyama 1997 ; masunaga & inutsuka 1999 ) . from figures 2 and 3 , the final fragmentation occurs at about @xmath140 for clouds collapsing along the atomic cooling track . on the other hand",
    ", it seems difficult for molecular cooling clouds to fragment at @xmath141 .",
    "the masses of fragments , which is about the jeans mass at that time , are about @xmath84 for the atomic - cooling clouds , and @xmath142 for the molecular - cooling clouds .",
    "if this is the case and the whole material contained in a fragment is converted into a single star , very massive stars form from a molecular - cooling cloud , and red dwarfs form as a result of atomic cooling .",
    "however , it should be noted that the fragmentation and thermal evolution depend strongly on each other and also on the geometry of the clouds .",
    "in fact , uehara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded that the minimum mass of fragments is on the order of a solar mass , which is essentially the chandrasekhar mass , by studying thermal evolution of filamentary primordial clouds that collapse by molecular cooling .",
    "later , improved simulations by nakamura & umemura ( 1998 ) confirmed uehara et al.(1996 ) s result .",
    "the discrepancy between our mass of fragments ( @xmath143 ) and theirs ( @xmath144 ) results from the difference of the assumed geometry of the clouds ; we have assumed spherical clouds in studying the thermal evolution , while their clouds are filamentary .",
    "for filamentary clouds , the gravitational contraction is slower and compressional heating rate is lower than for spherical ones .",
    "hence , for the filamentary cloud the isothermality breaks down at higher density , where the jeans mass is smaller . to fully address the complexity arising from the cloud geometry ,",
    "two - dimensional or three - dimensional calculations are needed",
    ". furthermore , there are other uncertainties relating to the evolution of the fragments , for example , mass accretion onto the fragments , merger between them , feedback from neighboring formed stars , etc .",
    "( e.g. , bromm et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it seems premature to draw conclusions here about these issues .",
    "i would like to thank shu - ichiro inutsuka , ryoichi nishi , humitaka sato , toru tsuribe for crucial suggestions and discussions , and phil stancil for providing the data of the h@xmath145 photodissociation cross section .",
    "i also acknowledge the referee for improving the manuscript .",
    "this work is supported in part by research fellowships of the japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists , grant 4287 .",
    "in this section , we discuss key processes determining the amount of the molecular hydrogen forming under fuv radiation . in particular , we delineate the condition for sufficient h@xmath3 for cooling to form .",
    "the h@xmath3 fraction @xmath146 necessary to cool within a free - fall time is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the h@xmath3 cooling function and we assume @xmath149 .",
    "when the actual h@xmath3 fraction @xmath146 reaches @xmath150 , the temperature drops abruptly as seen in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "next , we discuss how much h@xmath3 forms during the collapse . the h@xmath3 abundance is bounded by the following three values ;    \\(1 ) the amount of h@xmath3 that is able to form within a free - fall time , @xmath151 ,    \\(2 ) the chemical equilibrium value between h@xmath3 formation and photodissociation , @xmath152 ,    \\(3 ) the chemical equilibrium value between h@xmath3 formation and collisional dissociation , @xmath153 .    in practice ,",
    "the smallest among these three values is realized ; @xmath154.\\ ] ] in the following , we examine the values of @xmath155 , and @xmath153 in this order .",
    "first , we find the formation time limited value @xmath156 .",
    "h@xmath3 formation occurs mainly through the h@xmath1 channel : @xmath157 followed by @xmath158 in the above chain , not all of h@xmath1 formed are used in h@xmath3 formation . instead ,",
