    "motion equations of a system of @xmath0 point vortices on a sphere can be presented in the hamiltonian form  @xcite with the poisson bracket @xmath1 and the hamiltonian @xmath2 where  @xmath3 , @xmath4 and  @xmath5  are spherical coordinates and the intensity of the  @xmath6-th vortex , @xmath7  is an angle between the  @xmath6-th and the  @xmath8-th vortices , @xmath9  is a radius of the sphere the prime denotes that @xmath10 . here and further all indices values from  1 to  @xmath0 .",
    "motion equations of such a system have the form @xmath11    in the case of equal intensities  @xmath5 the system is invariant with respect to the discrete group of permutations of vortices , and therefore allows different symmetric partial solutions . let us consider partial solutions , which are analogous to the well known thomson s configurations on a plane . then the vortices are located on the same latitude  @xmath12 in the vertices of a regular  @xmath0-gon and rotate around its center with the angular velocity  @xmath13 : @xmath14    let us consider stability of these partial solutions in linear approximation .",
    "the study of stability of thomson s configurations of vortices on a plane in linear approximation was carried out by j.thomson  @xcite .",
    "he has shown that they are stable in linear approximation for  @xmath15 , and unstable for  @xmath16 .",
    "let us take variations  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 as @xmath19 the linearized equations for  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 are autonomous and have the form : @xmath20 where  @xmath21  is an @xmath22-matrix with the elements @xmath23 by differentiating with respect to time , the equations  ( [ f6 ] ) can be reduced to a system of @xmath0 second - order equations in the following form : @xmath24 ( similar equations are obtained for  @xmath25 under elimination of  @xmath26 ) .",
    "a solution of the equation  ( [ f8 ] ) has the form @xmath27 where the constants  @xmath28 are expressed through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix  @xmath29 . as in the case of a plane  @xcite ,",
    "the elements of  @xmath29 depend only on differences  @xmath30 , thus the matrix  @xmath21 can be diagonalized by the fourier transformation , and the eigenvalues of the matrix can be presented as @xmath31\\,.\\ ] ] each eigenvalue corresponds to two eigenvectors  @xmath32 and  @xmath33 , @xmath34 . to the values  @xmath35 and  @xmath36 ( in case of even  @xmath0 ) , there corresponds a unique eigenvector  @xmath37 @xcite .    using  ( [ f8 ] ) ,  ( [ f9 ] ) , we find frequencies  @xmath38 @xmath39    the presence of the zero frequency  ( [ f10 ] ) at  @xmath35 corresponds to instability of thomson s configurations in the absolute coordinate system . indeed , under perturbations  @xmath17 , @xmath40 corresponding to  @xmath35 the thomson s configuration  ( [ f4 ] ) transforms into thomson s configuration , which is close to the latter and moves away from it linearly with time .",
    "stability of relative motions of the vortices , from which we exclude the rotations of the system as solid - state configuration , are determined by the remained frequencies .",
    "it is necessary for the relative stability the remained frequencies  @xmath38 purely imaginary .",
    "it is obvious from  ( [ f10 ] ) that the configurations  ( [ f4 ] ) gradually lose their stability approaching the equator ( i.e. with magnification of  @xmath12 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the boundaries of varying of the radicand in  ( [ f10 ] ) for various  @xmath0 with the maximum value  @xmath41 and also values of  @xmath42 , at which the radicand changes the sign .    for  @xmath43",
    "there is always at least one frequency with a positive real part , hence , such configurations are unstable already in the linear approximation .",
    "l +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for  @xmath44 and 2 and for  @xmath45 all frequencies  @xmath38 are purely imaginary .",
    "thus , under the above - mentioned conditions the specified configurations are stable in linear approximation . for  @xmath46 $ ] these configurations",
    "are either unstable in linear approximation or consideration of higher order approximations ( at  @xmath47 ) is required for determination of stability .",
    "the work by l.g.khazin  @xcite introduced a proof of the lyapunov stability of thomson s configurations in nonlinear statement on a plane . however , though the general theorem from the stability theory , proved by l.g.khazin in this work is correct , its application to thomson s configurations on a plane is not appropriate .",
    "zero frequencies considered by khazin correspond to the motion of vortices as a whole and are not connected with the relative stability of thomson s configurations . thus , the problem of stability of thomson s configurations on a plane in strict nonlinear statement was not solved .",
    "let us show the lyapunov stability of thomson s configurations on a sphere and plane relatively to the perturbations of mutual distances between vortices ( further we shall speak about `` relative '' stability ) for  @xmath49 .",
    "the most general kind of motion of two vortices on a sphere ( plane ) is the uniform rotation around a motionless axis , which passes through the center of vorticity and the center of sphere ( perpendicular plane ) with preservation of the mutual distance  @xcite . under a small perturbation in this system",
    "the distance between vortices changes a little , but it is also preserved during the motion .",
    "thus , thomson s configurations of two vortices are  relatively \" lyapunov stable both on a sphere and on a plane .",
    "let us consider a geometric interpretation of motion of three vortices on a sphere , that was used in  @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we represent the surface of integral @xmath52    in the space of  @xmath53 , where  @xmath54  are inverse intensities of vortices , and  @xmath55  are squared distances between vortices . the triangular area presented in fig .",
    "1 is selected by the conditions  @xmath56 .",
    "we have painted the areas of nonphysical states , for which the triangle inequality is not fulfilled over , in black .",
    "the curves represent levels of the energy integral .",
    "thomson s configuration on this figure corresponds to the point  @xmath21 , where  @xmath57 .",
    "as we can see from the figure , under small perturbation of thomson s configuration the system starts moving along the level of the energy integral and @xmath58 , close to the point @xmath21 , which is bounded .",
    "thus , after perturbation the system moves in a small neighbourhood of the point @xmath21 , without leaving it .",
    "analogous arguments can be carried out for the case of a plane .",
    "hence , thomson s configurations of three vortices are `` relatively '' lyapunov stable both on a sphere and on a plane .      to show the `` relative '' lyapunov stability of thomson s configurations for  @xmath60 and for @xmath61 let us diagonalize the quadratic part of the hamiltonian  @xmath62 .",
    "such a diagonalization , as it has been already said above , is carried out with the help of fourier transformation given by the matrix @xmath63 after this diagonalization and elimination of a degree of freedom , corresponding to the motion of vortices as a solid - state configuration , we obtain : @xmath64    for  @xmath45 the quadratic hamiltonians  ( [ f11 ] ) are positively defined and , consequently , can be used as lyapunov functions . thus , thomson s configurations of four , five and six vortices are `` relatively '' lyapunov stable on a sphere in areas of their linear stability .",
    "proceeding to limit  @xmath65 , it is also possible to show a `` relative '' lyapunov stability on a plane .",
    "thomson s configuration are unstable in linear approximation on a sphere in case @xmath67 . on a plane the linear instability vanishes , but appears in the system of two zero frequencies with two - dimensional jordan cells ( the neutral case of a indifferent equilibrium ) .",
    "after diagonalization the quadratic hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and the values of @xmath70 and @xmath9 are assumed to be 1 .",
    "it can be seen that this system has two resonances of type 1:1 ( variables 3 , 4 and 5 , 6 ) and two zero frequencies with two - dimensional jordan cells ( variables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ f12 ] ) is not positively defined , and , therefore , to study its stability it is necessary to investigate expansions of the hamiltonian of higher order . for simplification of the hamiltonian form we shall carry out the procedure of deprit - hori normalization ( a detailed exposition of the procedure of deprit - hori normalization with the presence of zero frequencies with two - dimensional jordan cells",
    "is presented in appendix ) .",
    "after normalization the hamiltonian of the third degree will have the form : @xmath71 where  @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 does not depend on the variables  @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , degrees of freedom , corresponding to these variables in approximation of the third order , are separated .",
    "further we can consider a system with four degrees of freedom only .    to prove the instability of this system",
    "let us use a method of constructions of quasihomogeneous truncations of expansion of a hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "thus for a system obtained from the initial one by quasihomogeneous truncation , we try to find sets of partial solutions as twisted rays  @xmath75 .",
    "we have considered basic quasihomogeneous truncations of a system of the third degree . however , non of them has a partial solution in form of twisted rays .",
    "the book  @xcite presents constructions of increasing solutions for systems with two degrees of freedoms with resonances 1:1 and two zero frequencies with two - dimensional jordan cells . in the case of resonance 1:1 , to construct the increasing solutions we must have the terms of no less than the  @xmath76 degree in variables , corresponding to the resonance ; and in case of two zero frequencies with two - dimensional jordan cells the terms must be no less than of the third degree . due to particularity of the system and a large number of degrees of freedom , there is no such terms in this case , @xmath77 includes only `` mixed '' terms ( depending both on variables , corresponding to the resonance 1:1 , and on variables , corresponding to zero frequencies ) .",
    "probably , this is the reason why it is impossible to find increasing partial solutions .",
    "motion equations of the system of the third degree have an invariant manifold @xmath78 the equations of motion on this manifold take the form : @xmath79 a solution of the given system is a set of particular solutions , which increase linearly with time .",
    "however , a linearly increasing solution of the truncated system can not be extended to an asymptotically increasing solution of the complete system ( which is possible for solutions in the form of twisted rays ) .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the further expansion of the hamiltonian up to terms of the fourth degree .    the normal form of the 4-th degree can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 in the case of  @xmath82 , an analogy with  @xmath77 , we did not manage to find a quasihomogeneous truncation of the system which would admit increasing partial solutions in the form of twisted rays",
    ".    taking into account terms of the fourth degree in the hamiltonian , equations on the manifold  ( [ f14 ] ) have the form : @xmath83 where  @xmath84 .",
    "the equations  ( [ f16 ] ) have an integral @xmath85 levels of the integral on a phase plane  @xmath86 represent closed oval curves of the fourth degree with their center in the origin .",
    "hence , motions of the system on the manifold  ( [ f14 ] ) will be limited .",
    "thus , the addition of terms of the fourth degree in the hamiltonian has resulted in smoothing of linear instability , appearing in analysis of the hamiltonian of the third degree .",
    "the further normalization is connected with large computing complexity and , strictly speaking , the problem of stability for  @xmath67 remains open .",
    "this problem , in a sense , is a limiting problem for systems , containing a parameter , which is the curvature in the problem under consideration .",
    "for the zero value of the parameter a linear analysis is insufficient , and we have to take into account the nonlinear terms . in favour of instability",
    "we can specify the fact that , with adding of small curvature , the solutions become unstable in linear approximation .",
    "however , this reason can not be considered as a strict proof of instability .",
    "thus , the following generalization of thomson s theorem on stability of regular @xmath0-gon configurations of vortices on a sphere is true :    * theorem 1 . * _ let us consider regular @xmath0-gon configurations of vortices on a sphere , located on the same latitude  @xmath12@xmath87 _",
    "@xmath88 _ for  @xmath43 , they are unstable with respect to deformations@xmath89 _    @xmath90 _ for  @xmath91 and  @xmath92 , they are lyapunov stable with respect to deformations for  @xmath93 , and unstable for  @xmath94 .",
    "the limiting latitudes of the stability  @xmath95 are determined by formulas _",
    "@xmath96    @xmath97 _ for  @xmath98 , they are lyapunov stable with respect to deformations for all  @xmath12 . _    * remark 1 . *",
    "_ the problem of stability at  @xmath47 at  @xmath99 and 6 requires separate analysis with respect to nonlinear terms and remains unsolved to the present day .",
    "_    as for a plane , we have the following :    * theorem 2 . *",
    "_ regular @xmath0-gon configurations of vortices on a plane are lyapunov stable with respect to deformations for  @xmath100 , and unstable for  @xmath101 .",
    "the problem of stability for  @xmath67 remains unsolved . _",
    "in this work we use the method of deprit - hori normalization for construction of normal forms of hamiltonian near a fixed point .",
    "a detailed exposition of this method in case of absence of jordan cells can be found , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "here we shall generalize this algorithm to the case of the presence of two - dimensional jordan cells . to determine a normal form",
    "we shall apply the transformation close to identical , defined by a hamiltonian  @xmath102 .",
    "the hamilton form of transformation ensures its canonical properties .",
    "the initial hamiltonian  @xmath103 , a normalized hamiltonian  @xmath104 and the function  @xmath102 are expanded into a series in terms of a small parameter near a fixed point @xmath105 here all functions  @xmath106 and  @xmath107 are polynomials of  @xmath108 degree with respect to phase variables .",
    "a  normalized hamiltonian up to  @xmath8 degree is obtained by successive solution of operator equations @xmath109+l_nh_0\\mbox { ,   } n\\ge1\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 for  @xmath111 .",
    "thus , on the  @xmath108-th step , the normalization procedure is reduced to the solution of the equation @xmath112 where  @xmath113  is a known function , depending on functions already found on the previous steps of normalization .    as we consider the normalization near a fixed point",
    ", it is obvious that the expansion of  @xmath103 will begin with the second order terms .",
    "hence , the corresponding expansions of  @xmath104 and  @xmath102 will begin with the second and the third order terms .",
    "the equation  ( [ s2 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath114 where  @xmath115 .",
    "while solving the equation  ( [ s3 ] ) , the function  @xmath107 is selected so that all terms in the right part of the equation  ( [ s3 ] ) are excluded , except those , which could not be presented as  @xmath116 , where  @xmath117  is some function .",
    "@xmath118 will consist of these remained terms .",
    "let a quadratic part of the hamiltonian  @xmath62 lack jordan cells .",
    "then after diagonalization and complex change @xmath119 the quadratic part of the hamiltonian  @xmath62 has the form : @xmath120 the action of an operator  @xmath121 on some monomial  @xmath122 is defined by expression @xmath123 where  @xmath124  is a vector of frequencies .",
    "the operator  @xmath121 does not change the degree of monomial , but only multiplies it by some constant .",
    "thus , in the right part of  ( [ s1 ] ) we are unable to eliminate only those monomials , for which the following equality @xmath125 is fulfilled . a normalizing function and a normalized hamiltonian will take the form : @xmath126 where  @xmath127  are monomials included in  @xmath128 .",
    "let  @xmath62 have  @xmath8 zero frequencies with two - dimensional jordan cells , then  @xmath62 can be presented as @xmath129 after a complexification with respect to variables  @xmath130 we obtain @xmath131 in this case , the operator  @xmath132 has the form @xmath133 where the operator  @xmath134 acts on a space of variables  @xmath135 , and has the same properties , as the operator  @xmath132 in section 5.1 ( i.e. it does not change the degrees of monomials ) . in this case , the operator  @xmath132 does not already preserve the form of monomials .",
    "let us consider its action on some monomial @xmath136 where @xmath137    applying the operator  @xmath132 to  @xmath127 we obtain @xmath138 let @xmath139 then the equation  ( [ s3 ] ) for coefficients of monomial  @xmath127 will take the form @xmath140 here  @xmath141  is unit vectors of an integer lattice . from  ( [ s8 ] ) it is clear that it is impossible to set  @xmath142 equal to zero , if both conditions are fulfilled simultaneously :",
    "* case i. * let us consider an integer lattice  @xmath151 .",
    "for each monomial  @xmath127 and function  @xmath152 , which excludes the latter , we shall put in the correspondence a point of this lattice .",
    "let us denote  @xmath153-plane as the hyperplane cutting off a @xmath8-dimensional angle in @xmath154-space , determined by the equation @xmath155 let  @xmath128 contain a monomial  @xmath127 .",
    "the given monomial can be excluded from the right part of  ( [ s3 ] ) with the help of function  @xmath156 . under this elimination , as we can see from  ( [ s7 ] ) , in the right part of  ( [ s3 ] ) we get the sum of monomials @xmath157 thus , we pass from the point  @xmath154 to the neighbouring points  @xmath158 . such passage is always made from  @xmath153-plane into  @xmath159-plane , and the monomials are multiplied by  @xmath160 . using the same method we exclude originating monomials and move along a lattice in the direction to the origin . in the general case an arbitrary point of the lattice can be reached by several paths , and at the same time appearing monomials are summarized . when any coordinate becomes equal to zero at such a motion , the further motion takes place in remaining variables only . in fig.2",
    "the lattice and such passages at @xmath161 are presented .",
    "a sequence of the passages constructed in such a way breaks on a point  @xmath162 .    adding normalizing functions  @xmath152 by all points of a rectangle",
    ", we obtain a function  @xmath163 , that excludes a monomial  @xmath127 : @xmath164 where  @xmath165 , @xmath166  is a number of paths from point  @xmath154 into point  @xmath167 moving in direction of origin .",
    "this number can be calculated with the help of recurrence relation @xmath168 besides the successive elimination of monomials of the first type with the help of functions  ( [ s10 ] ) , they can also be eliminated with the help of functions  @xmath152 . for this method",
    "it is neccessary to take such order of enumeration of @xmath169 that with elimination of the next monomial in the right part of  ( [ s3 ] ) , the excluded earlier monomials do not appeared again . since the elimination of monomial  @xmath127 with the help of  @xmath152 we pass from  @xmath153-plane into  @xmath159-plane , such order is a sequential enumeration of all monomials with maximum  @xmath170 , then with  @xmath153 smaller on one unit , etc .",
    "* case ii .",
    "* in this case an action of the operator  @xmath171 over monomial  @xmath127 has the form @xmath172 thus , it is possible to exclude the monomial  @xmath127 with the help of the functions @xmath173 and in the right part of  ( [ s3 ] ) the sum @xmath174 is obtained . as we can see from the interpretation of an integer lattice , with such elimination we pass from the point  @xmath154 in points  @xmath175 .",
    "thus there occures a motion in one  @xmath153-plane .    successively applying transformation with the functions  ( [ s12 ] ) for various  @xmath176 we obtain some chain of monomials . selecting the coefficients for excluding functions  ( [ s12 ] ) we can reduce the whole chain to any of its monomials .",
    "thus , if we can exclude only one of monomials from a chain without emerging of new terms , the whole chain can be excluded from the right part of  ( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "the monomial can be completely excluded , when all terms in the sum  ( [ s13 ] ) equal zero , i.e. when for some of  @xmath6 we have  @xmath177 and  @xmath178 .",
    "we can reduce an arbitrary monomial to such form ( and exclude it completely ) , if there exists at least one @xmath6 , such that @xmath179 we can prove it with the use of an invariance of the inequality  ( [ s14 ] ) with respect to the transformations  ( [ s12 ] ) . if for the monomial  @xmath180 the inequalities @xmath181 are fulfilled , the given monomial can not be excluded completely from the right part .",
    "we can only transfer it into any of monomials from the chain .",
    "thus monomials , satisfying  ( [ s15 ] ) are resonance monomials .",
