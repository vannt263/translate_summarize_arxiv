    "in conclusion , we have found that the dynamical constraints brought by a strong interaction can trap the evolution of repulsive bosons hopping on a lattice into metastable states that lack translational symmetry , provided that the energy stored into the initial state is above a threshold .",
    "we pointed out that a self - induced effective attraction among doublons is one of the major processes that can effectively freeze the dynamics on long time scales .",
    "such a mechanism is recognized to play a role in the density relaxation processes of purely homogeneous systems through a dynamical arrest visible in time - dependent density correlations .",
    "the main features of this intriguing behavior , namely the slowing down of density excitations and the long - lived inhomogeneous pattern , resembles closely a kind of glass transition .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the time evolution of the many - body problem can be mapped onto that of a particle moving from the edge of a semi - infinite tight - binding chain with nearest - neighbor hopping , where each site represents a many - body wave function .",
    "this model looks like an anderson model , since both the on - site energy and the hopping vary from site to site , with a potential well at one edge due to the high - energy content of the initial state .",
    "interestingly , we find a delocalization - localization transition in this problem , with the particle being unable to diffuse on the whole chain above a certain value of the well depth .",
    "we consider this analogy quite suggestive and potentially constitute an even stronger indication of ergodicity breaking in the many - body space which is worth to be further investigated .",

    "the exact time evolution of an initial quantum state @xmath68 is given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the eigenstates of @xmath45 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , in order to follow the quantum dynamics to large times , the full knowledge of the spectrum is in principle needed .",
    "however , whenever the hilbert space is so large that it does not allow for a full diagonalization , an alternative approach is in order . at each time , we can make an evolution for a time step @xmath73 by considering a truncated taylor expansion of the unitary evolution : @xmath74 here , the series converges very quickly with @xmath75 and the cutoff @xmath76 must be chosen to obtain the desirable convergence for a given @xmath73 .",

    "the numerical accuracy of the unitary evolution can be verified by checking the conserved quantities of the time - evolution ( for example the total energy ) which in our calculations remain to all purposes constant up to the longest considered evolution times .      in this work",

    "numerical truncation errors can indeed accumulate and lead the most recently generated lanczos vector not to be orthogonal to the previously generated ones . to overcome this problem ,",

    "indeed , our method is essentially a straightforward generalization of the variational technique , where the probability density is strictly non - negative .",
    "although approximated , this approach has firm physical basis and can accurately reproduce numerically exact results in cases where t - dmrg method can be applied ( e.g. , mostly in one - dimensional lattices ) .",
    "nonetheless , variational monte carlo can be generalized and applied in larger dimensions without any further numerical instability .    in general",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that the relevant physical properties driving the dynamics can be reduced to a number of parameters significantly smaller than the size of the full hilbert space of the problem , as much as it is done in renormalization - based numerical and analytical tools .",

    "not surprisingly , the same equation of motions that we have derived by means of an optimal distance principle can be also derived from the variational principle , namely it can been shown that the action @xmath131 is indeed stationary for the time - trajectories of the variational parameters induced by eqs .   and  .",
    "the time - dependent expectation values over the square modulus of the many - body wave function can not be calculated analytically for generic operators @xmath104 , and a variational quantum monte carlo is needed to evaluate them . in particular , @xmath132 can be straightforwardly interpreted as a probability distribution over the hilbert space spanned by the configurations @xmath133 and a markov process can be devised , such that the stationary equilibrium distribution coincides with the desired probability measure .      in the main paper , we have concentrated our attention on the unitary - filling density , where at equilibrium a mott transition takes place upon increasing the interaction strength . to better realize the importance of the density on our considerations on the large-@xmath2 relaxation times , we now show the exact time evolution of inhomogeneous states at @xmath37 .",

    "this fact suggests that the dynamical constraints brought by the effective interaction among doblons are much stronger at @xmath14 , where a sharp crossover in the relaxation times is observed .",
    "we finally remark that , even at non unitary fillings , we expect larger clusters of doblons to have larger relaxation times than the simple initial state we have considered here . the possibility of a non - thermal behavior at non - unitary filling can not be excluded , even though the strongest manifestation of the dynamical arrest is expected to happen at @xmath14 .     exact time evolution of the densities on initially doubly occupied sites at filling @xmath38 for an @xmath135 chain .",

    ", we consider a model of one - dimensional hard - core bosons prepared in an initial inhomogeneous state with an alternating density profile @xmath10 and let it evolve in the lanczos basis with their non - interacting ( integrable ) kinetic hamiltonian . in fig .",
    "[ fig : v0mod ] , we show both the lanczos hopping elements and the expectation value of the lanczos particle traveling in the many - body space .",
    "the effect of integrability is to reduce the number of allowed lanczos states with respect to the total hilbert space .",
    "indeed , we find that the hopping is a strongly decreasing function of the iterations , approaching zero after a certain number of states @xmath141 that is a finite fraction of the full hilbert space . noticeably , the average position traveled by the particle increases accordingly , leading , therefore , to a full delocalization in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this analysis shows that a localization in the lanczos basis is not necessarily due to integrability  whose effect only amounts to reduce the number of active many - body states  whereas it is due to the effective dynamical constraints brought by the interaction ."

    "<S> a closer look to the structure of the on site energies reveal the existence of a potential well at the edge of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> this is crucial in order to understand the observed localization transition . </S>",
    "<S> since the potential well can not induce a true bound state below the bottom of the spectrum , at most a resonance will form in the spectrum , from which the particle could in principle escape in a finite time . </S>",
    "<S> this indeed happens at small @xmath2 but apparently not at large @xmath2 , where the increased depth of the well and the effective randomness of the on - site energies conspire together to keep the particle localized close to the edge , preventing the the states in the well to hybridize with other states along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> we now see how this result connects with the previous analysis on the density relaxation times . in the small @xmath8 regime </S>",

    "<S> , the particle bounces back and forth inside the well , finding hard time to escape from it . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of diffusion results into a very long - time scale for the density to relax to its homogeneous value .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results show explicitly that some kind of localization in the many - body configurational space does occur , at least in the finite system .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite while such an intriguing behavior might well be a subtle effect due to the finite size spectrum , it could also signal the onset of a genuine localization that survives in the thermodynamic limit .        </S>",
    "<S> we conclude the discussion on the inhomogeneous initial states by studying the case at density @xmath37 , when at equilibrium there is no longer a mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we consider @xmath38 and an initial density profile @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find quite a different behavior for the density relaxation times @xmath17 ( see supplementary material ) , with a much smoother crossover from small to large values of @xmath8 and no evidence of any increase in the relaxation times with the system size . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests a deeper connection between the observed dynamical behavior and the zero temperature mott transition that occurs at equilibrium and at integer filling , as suggested by calculations with infinite - coordination lattices .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite       inverse relaxation times of density excitations in the homogeneous system , see eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> from left to right , different curves correspond to different initial states at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> insets : real part of the density correlations @xmath43 in the ergodic and in the non - ergodic region . </S>",
    "<S> data are obtained with exact - diagonalization on a lattice with @xmath44 . ]    in light of the previous results , one may question that by choosing an inhomogeneous configuration of doublons we pick up a rather specific initial state in the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we are now going to show that the above findings strongly affect the dynamics starting from a perfectly homogeneous state . </S>",
    "<S> in this respect , a particularly interesting class of initial states are the ground states of @xmath45 for given values of the interaction @xmath46 , which are let evolve under the hamiltonian dynamics after a sudden increase of the interaction to a final value @xmath47 , the so - called quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> kollath and coworkers  @xcite reported evidence for the existence of two separated regimes in which either thermal or non - thermal behavior is observed for local observables . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the non - thermal behavior in the large @xmath48 region and the possibility of an ergodicity breaking in the thermodynamic limit is still highly debated  @xcite .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on an average density @xmath14 and we show that signatures of long lived metastable states of doblons can be identified in the dynamics after a quantum quench . at variance with the previous numerical calculations , now both the initial state and the quantum hamiltonian do preserve the spatial homogeneity and , therefore , the quest for possible signatures of ergodicity breaking requires a different approach . since we have identified density relaxation as the slowest process in the problem , we monitor the dynamics of the system by measuring the auto - correlation of the density averaged over all sites , namely through @xmath49    for any finite size system , @xmath50 since the densities decorrelate at very long times . indeed , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relax ] , for small @xmath51 this quantity has a very fast transient to zero . on the contrary , for @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> the density auto - correlation @xmath43 gets stuck into a long - lived finite value plateau @xmath53 , before approaching zero only on a much longer time scale . </S>",
    "<S> if we extract a relaxation time from @xmath43 , we find a similar behavior as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : decdef ] , i.e. , a dramatic increase of the relaxation times above a threshold value of the final interaction strength .    in agreement with the previous analysis , the appearance of such a long - lived metastable state characterized by a finite plateau @xmath54 of the density auto - correlation function might indicate an excess of double occupancies that have no channel to relax . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the dynamical constraints brought by the interaction severely slow down density excitations , whose characteristic time scales increase abruptly after a critical threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the main phenomenological traits of this _ dynamical arrest _ characterized by long - lived inhomogeneous states closely remind the physics of glassy materials .      </S>",
    "<S> the previous discussion revealed the existence of a threshold energy above which a steep increase of the relaxation time of density fluctuations takes place . in order to assess the relevance of this phenomenon for the dynamics of larger systems or even for higher spatial dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to devise a comprehensive alternative framework able to catch its very characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> here , we introduce an approach based on real - time variational monte carlo ( see supplementary material for details ) , which has two important advantages : it allows us to follow the evolution for times comparable to those accessible experimentally , which are much longer than t - dmrg ;  @xcite it can be easily extended to higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that mean - field - like variational approaches to the real - time dynamics of correlated systems have been developed in recent years .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite     one - dimensional results for the time - dependent expectation values of the on - site potential energy @xmath55 in the ergodic ( _ upper panel _ ) and in the non - ergodic regions ( _ lower panel _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is the ground state of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian with @xmath56 and the considered system size is @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> grand - canonical thermal averages are shown for comparison as dashed horizontal lines . ]    </S>",
    "<S> however , although they seem to capture well the main features of the dynamical evolution , these methods are unable to describe important aspects such as damping and relaxation . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> our approach is sufficiently rich to account for damping and relaxation of local observables . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a very simple and transparent out - of - equilibrium extension of the jastrow - like variational wave function that was shown to describe quite accurately the equilibrium phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model :  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial state and @xmath60 is a jastrow factor that depends on the occupancies @xmath61 and @xmath62 of two sites @xmath5 and @xmath63 and varies with time so to maintain the time evolution as close as possible to the true evolution via the schroedinger equation ( see supplementary material ) . the comparison between our approach and the t - dmrg  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is reported in the supplementary materials , demonstrating the high accuracy of the time - dependent variational monte carlo .    </S>",
    "<S> results for the time evolution of a local observable , such as the potential energy , after a sudden quench from @xmath56 to a final @xmath48 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eq - values ] . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the thermal averages have been computed in the grand - canonical ensemble by means of finite - temperature quantum monte carlo calculations ,  @xcite with the effective temperature fixed by the average energy of the initial state , which we take as the best variational approximation for the ground state at @xmath56 .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eq - values ] , in the region of small @xmath48 we observe a damping of the average potential - energy , which approaches a quasi - steady stationary value in contrast to the simple gutzwiller wave function ,  @xcite . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , damping is mainly due to a density - density jastrow factor of the form @xmath64 , which already at equilibrium was shown to provide a satisfactory description of the physical behavior .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this fact enlightens the relevance of the bogoliubov modes whose dephasing during the time evolution allows to approach the stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the steady state averages coincide with the thermal ones ; a signal that the dynamics is ergodic .    in the region of large interactions @xmath48 , </S>",
    "<S> a simple density - density jastrow factor does not account for all relaxation pathways , which will now mainly result from specific correlations among doublons , holons and between holons and doublons . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian   indeed explicitly shows that doublons attract each other as well as holons do , while doublons repel holons . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations , as well as other among higher on - site densities , can be easily implemented via the the jastrow factor in eq .   and </S>",
    "<S> indeed substantially improve the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the effective interaction between doblons that results from the dynamical variational calculation turns to be _ attractive _ , therefore leading to a consistent determination of the anticipated dynamical effects that drive the dynamics in this regime . as we see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eq - values ] , in the region of very large @xmath48 the potential - energy expectation values do show a damping to a non - thermal quasi - steady state on a time of the order of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this fast time scale must be put in comparison with the much longer one , @xmath17 of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relax ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to identify @xmath17 with the time scale that controls the eventual escape from the quasi - steady state , hence the approach to thermal equilibrium . whether this time scale does truly diverge in the thermodynamic limit , or rather saturates to a very large value which is still out of reach for state of the art numerics </S>",
    "<S> , it is certainly an important issue that can not be definitively solved . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can safely state that a large finite system of actual experimental relevance will get stuck for a quite long time into highly inhomogeneous metastable states , which we revealed to be on the verge of a spatial symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results have been obtained for out - of - equilibrium one dimensional systems and therefore leave the questions concerning the dependence on the dimensionality of the problem still open . </S>",
    "<S> however , the anomalously long - time relaxation of the density auto - correlation points towards a kind of glassy behavior that should be observable even in higher dimensions , provided that the interaction induces sufficiently strong dynamical constraints . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the two - dimensional case by means of our time - dependent variational scheme , verifying that a similar behavior occurs even in two dimensions . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eq - values-2d ] , we show the results of the potential - energy expectation values as a function of the time . as before , if the repulsion is weak , the time average coincides with the thermal ones , while for strong repulsion there is a clear difference between thermal and time averages , giving rise to a nonergodic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that the phenomenology we have hereby identified is almost independent on the dimensionality and it is rather due to the existence in strongly correlated systems of high - energy incoherent excitations that do not have channels to relax efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is also consistent with the observed strong doping dependence of the relaxation time ( see supplementary material ) .     </S>",
    "<S> two dimensional results for the time - dependent expectation values of the on - site potential energy @xmath55 in the ergodic ( _ upper panel _ ) and in the non - ergodic regions ( _ lower panel _ ) . </S>",
