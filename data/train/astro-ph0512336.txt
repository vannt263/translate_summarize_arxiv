    "the standard model of inflation , based on the existence of a scalar inflaton field , makes the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the beginning of inflation occurs at an energy @xmath28 ( planck energy ) .",
    "its origin is unknown and the state of the universe before the beginning of inflation is undefined ; 2 .",
    "a large initial displacement of @xmath29 from the minimum of @xmath30 is necessary for the onset of inflation ( such as in the chaotic inflation model ) ; 3 .",
    "the potential energy of the inflaton dominates its kinetic energy during inflation ; and 4 .",
    "the inflaton potential , @xmath30 , and its first derivative are defined by observations @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation .",
    "in complex inflation theories , there can be more than one inflaton .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review of inflation theory with inflatons . )    here we present a model which links the starobinsky and @xmath31 models of inflation , where @xmath2 is the ricci scalar to the reheating era .",
    "all three models , the starobinsky , @xmath0 and ours , do not involve inflatons to create inflation .",
    "they also avoid most of the above assumptions .    in the starobinsky model",
    "@xcite , an @xmath32 term in the effective lagrangian dominates inflation at late times ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is no sharp boundary between the starobinsky model and @xmath0 model since the latter is the particular case of the former in the limit @xmath33 ( using the notation of eq.(9 ) , with some small non - local terms ( due to non - zero rest masses of conformally coupled quantum fields ) omitted .",
    "however , the starobinsky and @xmath0 models have the same qualitative behavior at @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation , when the presently observed scalar and tensor fluctuations were produced .    both the starobinsky and @xmath0 cosmologies are characterized by a single mass @xmath3 ( @xmath34 in the @xmath0 cosmology and @xmath35 in the starobinsky model , where @xmath36 is the planck mass and @xmath37 is the coefficient of the term which contains the second derivative of @xmath2 in the quantum corrected vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor [ eq.([anomaly ] ) ] ) .",
    "the mass @xmath3 characterizes the end of the inflation period , during which , the hubble parameter varies slowly .",
    "a period then begins , in which @xmath38 oscillates rapidly as @xmath39 and the cosmological scale factor varies as @xmath40}/(3\\omega t)]$ ] , where @xmath41 .",
    "when averaged over several oscillations , the universe expands as a classical matter - dominated universe .    although the @xmath0 model can be considered to be the simplest way to produce inflation , i.e. , by means of a simple modification of the gravitational lagrangian , we concentrate here on the starobinsky model since it is more complete .",
    "it links the beginning of the inflation period to the beginning of the universe and also describes the end of inflation in detail .",
    "the starobinsky model suggests that for energy densities and curvatures near the planck scale , quantum corrections to einstein s equations become important ( as discussed in detail by vilenkin @xcite ) . in the starobinsky model ,",
    "inflation is driven by one - loop corrections due to quantized matter fields @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the model is consistent with a universe that was spontaneously created , as discussed by grishchuk and zeldovich @xcite .",
    "the beginning of the starobinsky inflation period can be associated with the beginning of the universe due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum .",
    "tryon @xcite was the first to suggest that a closed universe can be created spontaneously as a result of a quantum fluctuation .",
    "vilenkin @xcite , zeldovich and starobinsky @xcite , and linde @xcite were the first to attempt to describe the quantum creation of a universe in the framework of quantum gravity .",
    "the picture that emerges is one of a universe tunneling quantum mechanically to a de sitter space time . at the moment of nucleation ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the universe has a size @xmath43 .",
    "this is the beginning of time and , from that point on , the universe evolves along the lines of the inflation scenario .    in the starobinsky model , inflation is produced by the vacuum energy @xmath44 , which has negative pressure , @xmath45 .",
    "inflation in both the starobinsky and our models can be described by an effective geometric scalar particle @xmath3 . in our model",
    ", there is an additional massive particle @xmath6 produced at the end of inflation , which is freely moving and which produces positive pressure .",
    "structure in the universe primarily comes from almost scale - invariant superhorizon curvature perturbations @xcite . in our model ,",
    "a mass @xmath6 is much less than the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath6 particle production from inflation is based on the observation that particles that are massive in the present - day vacuum , could have been very light during inflation .",
    "this implies that fluctuations of a generic scalar field @xmath46 with mass @xmath47 during inflation are copiously generated , with an almost scale invariant spectrum @xcite .",
    "the particles become heavy and non - relativistic at the end of inflation .",
    "the end of the starobinsky inflation period has been suggested to be due to the masses of the particles in the vacuum fluctuations [ 14 ] .",
    "thus , since the mass @xmath3 describes the end of inflation in both the starobinsky and our models , @xmath3 is a natural mass scale for the particles that are created at the end of inflation . in our model",
    ", we then have the scenario that particles of mass comparable to the mass @xmath3 in the vacuum fluctuations first create the inflation , after which , particles of mass @xmath6 comparable to , but slightly less than @xmath3 , are produced from the vacuum due to the rapid change of the hubble parameter .",
    "the particles @xmath6 are conformally coupled to gravitation ( ricci scalar ) .",
    "these massive particles create the reheating epoch of the universe .",
    "our model can be compared with that of the starobinsky model , in which massless particles , non - conformally coupled to gravitation , directly create the reheating era .",
    "here we assume that non - conformal coupling does not exist .",
    "previously , gravitational production of massive particles has been investigated in order to explain the observed ultra - high energy cosmic rays , produced as a result of heavy particle decay ( masses @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational particle production of the heavy particles @xmath6 can be described assuming a given background metric @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give the main results of the starobinsky model , as discussed by vilenkin @xcite .",
    "we discuss the gravitational production of the @xmath6 particles in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we derive the scalar density fluctuations produced @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation .",
    "we obtain the ratio @xmath26 of the tensor to scalar fluctuations in section v. the reheating of the universe is discussed in section vi .",
    "our conclusions and discussion are presented in section vii .",
    "in this section , we discuss the starobinsky model of inflation , following the description and notation of vilenkin .",
    "this model is based on the semiclassical einstein equations , @xmath49 which assume a spatially flat robertson - walker metric , @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the proper ( conformal ) time and @xmath53 is the scale factor .",
    "the quantum corrections to the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor for massless particles in curved space time are @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath37 , @xmath57 are constants .",

    "<S> we present a model which predicts inflation without the presence of inflaton fields , based on the @xmath0 and starobinsky models . </S>",
    "<S> it links the above models to the reheating epoch with conformally coupled massive particles created at the end of inflation . in the original starobinsky model , the reheating era was created by massless non - conformally coupled particles . </S>",
    "<S> we assume here that non - conformal coupling to gravitation does not exist . in the @xmath0 model </S>",
    "<S> , inflation is produced by the gravitational lagrangian to which a term @xmath0 is added , where @xmath1 is a constant and @xmath2 is the ricci scalar . </S>",
    "<S> inflation is created by vacuum fluctuations in the starobinsky model . </S>",
    "<S> both models have the same late - inflation time - dependence , which is described by a characteristic mass @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a free parameter @xmath4 on the order of the planck mass @xmath5 that determines the hubble parameter near the planck epoch and which depends upon the number and type of particles creating the vacuum fluctuations in the starobinsky model . in our model </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the existence of particles with a mass @xmath6 , on the order of @xmath3 , conformally coupled to gravity , that have a long decay time . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath7 , we investigate values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> these particles , produced @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation , created the nearly scale invariant scalar density fluctuations which are observed . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational waves ( tensor fluctuations ) were also produced at this epoch . at @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the hubble parameter begins to oscillate rapidly , gravitationally producing the bulk of the @xmath6 particles , which we identify as the origin of the matter content of the universe today . </S>",
    "<S> the time required for the universe to dissipate its vacuum energy into @xmath6 particles is found to be @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the reheating time @xmath13 needed for the @xmath6 particles to decay into relativistic particles , is very much greater than that necessary to create the @xmath6 particles , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> a particle physics theory of @xmath6 can , in principle , predict their decay rate @xmath15 . from the ratio @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the total number of degrees of freedom of the relativistic particles ) we can </S>",
    "<S> , then , evaluate the maximum temperature of the universe @xmath19 and the reheat temperature @xmath20 at @xmath13 . from the observed scalar fluctuations at large scales , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 , we have the prediction @xmath22 and the ratio of the tensor to scalar fluctuations , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> thus our model predicts @xmath3 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath13 as a function of @xmath25 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( and to a weaker extent the particle content of the vacuum near the planck epoch ) . a measured value of @xmath26 that is appreciably different from @xmath27 would discard our model ( as well as the starobinsky and @xmath0 models ) </S>"
