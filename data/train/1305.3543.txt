    "the theory of degeneracy loci of vector bundles has its roots in the 19th century , motivated by questions in elimination theory and enumerative algebraic geometry .",
    "the modern subject began with the work of thom and porteous in topology , which was generalized and extended to the algebraic setting by kempf , laksov , and lascoux @xcite .",
    "the simplest example involves two complex vector bundles @xmath4 on a smooth algebraic variety @xmath5 .",
    "given a generic map of vector bundles @xmath6 and @xmath7 any integer , the locus @xmath8 of points @xmath9 where @xmath10 is called a _ degeneracy locus_.",
    "thom @xcite showed that the homology class of @xmath8 must be poincar dual to a universal polynomial in the chern classes of the vector bundles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and porteous @xcite later found this representing polynomial .",
    "such degeneracy loci arise frequently in problems of algebraic geometry and singularity theory , therefore explicit chern class formulas for these loci can be quite useful .",
    "we refer to @xcite for surveys , and to @xcite for an incomplete list of applications .    in a series of papers in the 1990s ,",
    "fulton @xcite generalized the work of kempf - laksov further , to a map of flagged vector bundles , and studied an analogue of the same problem for the other classical lie groups .",
    "this involved degeneracy loci given by incidence relations between a pair of isotropic flags of subbundles of a fixed vector bundle , which is equipped with a symplectic or orthogonal form . in all cases , the _ schubert polynomials _ representing the cohomology classes of the loci were defined by an algorithm using divided difference operators ( stemming from @xcite ) applied to a ` top polynomial ' which represented the class of the diagonal ( the locus of points on the base variety where the two flags coincide ) .",
    "related computations were performed at much the same time by pragacz and ratajski @xcite , and other competing theories of schubert polynomials in the lie types b , c , and d were discovered @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "fulton and pragacz asked for combinatorially explicit , global formulas for the cohomology classes of degeneracy loci , which have a similar shape for all the classical groups , and are determinantal whenever possible .",
    "the aim of this article is to describe the answer to this question which was obtained in @xcite , building on a series of earlier works , in terms of data coming from the weyl group .",
    "graham @xcite recast the above degeneracy locus problem using the language of lie theory , and studied the universal case when the structure group @xmath0 of the fibre bundles involved is any complex reductive group ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "he observed that the degeneracy locus question of @xcite is essentially equivalent to the problem of obtaining a formula for the _ equivariant schubert classes _ in the torus - equivariant cohomology ring of the flag variety @xmath13 ( when @xmath0 is a classical group , there is also the twisted case , when the bilinear form takes values in a line bundle ) .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of a lie theorist , there seems to be no reason to exclude the exceptional groups from the degeneracy locus story .",
    "we will suggest two reasons below why the classical groups appear to be special for this question .    in type",
    "a , the double schubert polynomials of lascoux and schtzenberger @xcite were characterized as the unique polynomials that satisfy the general degeneracy locus formula of @xcite .",
    "fomin and kirillov @xcite observed that this strong uniqueness property breaks down in type b , where in fact there is a plethora of theories of ( single ) schubert polynomials .",
    "however , the schubert polynomials of billey and haiman @xcite impressed us as the most combinatorially explicit theory among those available in the other classical lie types .",
    "these polynomials enjoyed most of the properties of the type a single schubert polynomials , but their translation ( as given in @xcite ) into chern class formulas in @xmath14 involved a change of variables and an ensuing loss of combinatorial control .",
    "this problem was first addressed by the author @xcite , using a more natural and geometric substitution of the variables , with applications to arithmetic intersection theory .",
    "ikeda , mihalcea , and naruse @xcite later introduced double versions of the billey - haiman schubert polynomials and extended the substitution of @xcite to this setting  expressing it in a better way , as a ring homomorphism ( the _ geometrization maps _ of  [ ddgeom ] ) . with this work ,",
    "the search for a satisfactory analogue of the lascoux - schtzenberger theory in the other classical lie types was finally over .    although the decision of which theory of schubert polynomials to use is clearly important , by construction they only provide formulas in terms of the _ chern roots _ of the vector bundles involved .",
    "when the initial degeneracy locus problem carries the symmetries of a parabolic subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath0 , we seek an answer which manifestly exhibits the same symmetries .",
    "this should generalize the jacobi - trudi determinants and schur pfaffians that appear when the schubert polynomials are evaluated on ( maximal ) grassmannian elements of the weyl group , as in @xcite .",
    "in other words , we desire formulas that are _ native to @xmath15 _ , i.e. , expressed in terms of schubert classes that live in the cohomology ring of the homogeneous space @xmath15 .",
    "it turned out that a precise understanding of the _ giambelli problem _ for @xmath16 , which is closely related to the degeneracy locus formulas above , was necessary for further progress .",
    "the cohomology of @xmath2 is a free abelian group on the basis of schubert classes , the cohomology classes of the schubert varieties .",
    "when @xmath0 is a classical lie group , there are certain _ special schubert classes _ among these , which generate the ring @xmath17 .",
    "this is one place where the fact that @xmath0 is classical is important : at present , we do not know how to define special classes for the exceptional groups . for classical @xmath0",
    ", one has a good definition of special schubert varieties , which is uniform across the four types . in this case ,",
    "the variety @xmath3 parametrizes partial flags of subspaces of a vector space , which in types b , c , and d are required to be isotropic with respect to an orthogonal or symplectic form .",
    "if @xmath3 is an ( isotropic ) grassmannian , then the special schubert varieties are defined as the locus of ( isotropic ) linear subspaces which meet a given ( isotropic or coisotropic ) linear subspace nontrivially , following @xcite .",
    "the special schubert varieties on any partial flag variety @xmath3 are the inverse images of the special schubert varieties on the grassmannians to which @xmath3 projects .",
    "the special schubert classes are the cohomology classes of the special schubert varieties ; in most examples , they are equal to the chern classes of the universal _ quotient _ bundles over @xmath3 , up to a factor of two .",
    "the giambelli problem for @xmath17 challenges us to write a general schubert class as an explicit polynomial in the above special classes .",
    "the papers @xcite addressed this question for all ( isotropic ) grassmannians , and @xcite extended the answer to any classical @xmath15 space . to do this",
    ", we had to go beyond the known hermitian symmetric , fully commutative examples , and invent a considerable body of new combinatorics .",
    "the schubert classes are indexed by ( typed ) _ @xmath18-strict partitions _ , the giambelli formulas are expressed using young s _ raising operators _ @xcite and studied using a new calculus of these operators @xcite , the schur polynomials are extended to _ theta _ and _ eta polynomials _ , and instead of young tableaux , we count paths in _",
    "@xmath18-transition trees_. ultimately , all of these objects can be understood purely in terms of the combinatorics of the weyl group of ( signed ) permutations .",
    "the degeneracy locus problem is equivalent to the giambelli problem when the space @xmath3 varies in an algebraic family , and thus would appear to be more difficult .",
    "indeed , in most cases where determinantal formulas for the double schubert polynomials representing the loci were known , these formulas were significantly more complicated than their single versions  which address the giambelli problem in that case .",
    "the type a paper @xcite changed that paradigm : it established the surprising fact that if one uses the language of _ quiver polynomials _ , then the answer to the degeneracy locus problem has the same shape as that for the giambelli problem , and indeed , a near identical proof !",
    "this picture was generalized to all classical types in @xcite , in a synthesis which used all of the above ingredients , and added some new ones .",
    "the results were combinatorial",
    "_ splitting formulas _ for the schubert polynomials of @xcite , and direct translations of these into degeneracy locus formulas , with the symmetries native to the appropriate @xmath15 space .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explain the above story .",
    "the narrative combines elements from algebraic geometry , lie theory , and combinatorics , and we have strived to keep the exposition as self - contained as possible .",
    "we include one original contribution : a new proof of the main result of @xcite , which states that the double schubert polynomials in types b , c , and d represent the schubert classes .",
    "the setup in @xcite uses localization in equivariant cohomology , which we do not require here . the key idea ",
    "exploited in @xcite  is to use the elegant approach to schubert polynomials via the nilcoxeter algebra and the yang - baxter equation , pioneered in @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that the schubert polynomials are defined simply and directly in terms of reduced decompositions in the weyl group , without requiring the use of a ` top polynomial ' . from this point of view",
    ", one can also understand why the _ stability _ property of schubert polynomials is needed : it is only in the stable equivariant cohomology ring that compatibility with divided differences alone ( both left and right !  ",
    "an important insight of @xcite ) is enough to characterize the universal schubert classes , up to a scalar factor .",
    "anderson and fulton @xcite have recently also given a different proof of the main theorem of @xcite , within the framework of degeneracy loci , using a geometric argument which employs kazarian s multi - schur pfaffians @xcite .    we have made no attempt to write a survey , and in particular the extensive literature on the schubert calculus and the equivariant cohomology of homogeneous spaces is barely touched upon . in special cases , there are alternatives to the combinatorial formulas shown here ; the reader may consult @xcite for examples of what is known , and the papers @xcite for further references to related research . throughout this article",
    ", we work with cohomology groups , at times with rational coefficients",
    ". however , from these , one can deduce results for cohomology with integer coefficients , and also in the algebraic category , for the chow groups of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence .",
    "the necessary modifications to achieve this are explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ class ] and  [ isogiam ] with a discussion of giambelli formulas for grassmannians , expressing them using the language of raising operators .",
    "section [ cohgp ] contains general facts about the cohomology of @xmath15 spaces and the giambelli problem in this context .",
    "the combinatorial data coming from the weyl group and the algebraic objects necessary to state the general degeneracy locus formulas are given in  [ wgtts ] and  [ ssss ] , respectively .",
    "in particular ,  [ splitsps ] contains splitting formulas for schubert polynomials , which admit direct translations in  [ dloc ] to chern class formulas for degeneracy loci .",
    "section [ pfs ] outlines the proofs of the main theorems , and ",
    "[ fut ] contains some questions for the future .",
    "this project would not have been possible without the contributions of many authors , a list too long to mention here .",
    "i am particularly grateful for the hard work and support of my collaborators anders buch , andrew kresch , and alexander yong over a period of many years .",
    "the main object of study in classical schubert calculus is the grassmannian @xmath19 , which is the set of all @xmath20-dimensional complex linear subspaces of @xmath21 . given any subset @xmath22 of @xmath23 , we let @xmath24 denote the @xmath25-linear span of @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the canonical basis of @xmath27 , and @xmath28 be the codimension of the subspaces in @xmath3 .",
    "the general linear group @xmath29 acts transitively on @xmath3 , and the stabilizer of the point @xmath30 under this action can be identified with the subgroup @xmath1 of matrices in @xmath29 of the block form @xmath31 where the @xmath32 in the lower left corner denotes a @xmath33 zero matrix . in this way",
    "we get a description of @xmath3 as a coset space @xmath34 from which one can deduce that @xmath3 is a complex manifold of dimension @xmath35 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath1 is a _",
    "maximal parabolic subgroup _ of @xmath29 .",
    "a similar analysis shows that the manifold @xmath3 is isomorphic to @xmath36 , and hence is a compact manifold .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is a projective algebraic variety , and may be described by a system of quadratic polynomial equations , known as the plcker relations . for further details on this and other aspects of this section , we refer to @xcite .",
    "in the latter half of the 19th century , hermann schubert gave a first systematic treatment of enumerative projective geometry @xcite , in which the grassmannian @xmath3 played a prominent part .",
    "the course of his study led him to introduce certain natural closed algebraic subsets of @xmath3 , later known as the schubert varieties @xcite . to define them , set @xmath37 for each integer @xmath38 $ ] , and consider the complete flag of subspaces @xmath39 the stabilizer @xmath40 of @xmath41 is the _ borel subgroup _ of upper triangular matrices in @xmath29 . in modern language , the schubert varieties are the closures of the @xmath42-orbits in @xmath3 .",
    "each @xmath42-orbit in @xmath3 is called a schubert cell ; there are finitely many such cells , and they induce a cell decomposition of the manifold @xmath3 .",
    "we call a subset @xmath43 $ ] of cardinality @xmath20 an _ index set_. any point @xmath44 defines an index set @xmath45 by @xmath46 \\mid \\sigma \\cap",

    "it follows from this that any point @xmath55 such that @xmath47 must be in the orbit @xmath56 . in other words , the @xmath42-orbits ( or schubert cells ) in @xmath3 correspond 1 - 1 to the index sets @xmath57 .",
    "we let @xmath58 denote the schubert cell given by @xmath57 , that is , @xmath59 the definition implies that we have a cell decomposition @xmath60    suppose that @xmath61 is an index set .",

    "for example , if @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , then @xmath74 from this description we see that the @xmath42-orbit @xmath70 is isomorphic to affine space @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the number of @xmath77 s in the reduced row echelon form of matrices in the cell , namely @xmath78    at this point it is convenient to introduce a different parametrization for the schubert cells which makes their _ codimension _ apparent : let @xmath79 it is clear that there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between the vectors @xmath80 and index sets @xmath57 ( for fixed @xmath20 and @xmath81 ) ; for example @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "the conditions on the index set @xmath57 imply that @xmath83 equivalently , that @xmath80 is a _ partition _ whose first part @xmath84 is at most @xmath85 and number of nonzero parts @xmath86 is at most @xmath20 .",

    "pragacz and ratajski @xcite later obtained pieri type rules for general isotropic grassmannians , but used a different notion of ` special schubert classes ' than ours ( their special classes were the chern classes of the universal subbundles @xmath117 in  [ isogiam ] ) .    the proofs of theorems [ igthm ] and [ ogthmd ] from @xcite require the classical pieri rules from @xcite , which hold for the special schubert classes @xmath127 and @xmath924 defined in  [ isogiam ] . for the symplectic grassmannian @xmath203 , the pieri rule has the form @xmath925 = \\sum_{\\lambda \\xrightarrow{p } \\mu }    2^{n(\\lambda,\\mu ) } \\ , [ x_\\mu ] \\,.\\ ] ] when @xmath536 , the pieri relation @xmath926 and the definition of the exponents @xmath927 is more complicated than in the @xmath198 case of the lagrangian grassmannian .",
    "however , the pieri rule ( [ igpieri ] ) can still be used recursively to show that a general schubert class @xmath103 $ ] may be written as a polynomial in the special classes .",
    "therefore , in order to prove theorem [ igthm ] , it suffices to show that the expression @xmath928 satisfies the same pieri rule ( [ igpieri ] ) , and this is the approach taken in @xcite .",
    "the complex argument that proves that @xmath929 obeys ( [ igpieri ] ) uses subtle alternating properties of @xmath928 which depend on the order ideal @xmath223 , and a substitution algorithm which is a mathematical model of controlled evolution .",
    "the reader will find an exposition of the main ideas in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ ogthmd ] is similar to that of theorem [ igthm ] .",

    "@xmath931 defined in @xcite .",
    "these polynomials are analogues of the usual double ( or factorial ) schur polynomials , and give equivariant giambelli expressions for the schubert classes in @xmath932 .",
    "the proof of this in @xcite is based on a key result of ikeda and matsumura @xcite , which states that the @xmath931 are compatible with the action of left divided difference operators .",
    "following @xcite or by specializing the arguments of  [ ddgeom ] , one shows that the single schubert polynomials represent the schubert classes in @xmath14 , and that the algebra that they span is isomorphic to the stable cohomology ring @xmath933 of the complete flag manifold as @xmath934 .",
    "therefore , to prove theorem [ xtoy ] it suffices to show that ( a ) the schur , theta , and eta polynomials indexed by single row partitions agree with the corresponding single schubert polynomials , and ( b ) the giambelli formulas of  [ class ] and  [ isogiam ] hold in @xmath933 .",

    "<S> let @xmath0 be a classical complex lie group , @xmath1 any parabolic subgroup of @xmath0 , and @xmath2 the corresponding homogeneous space , which parametrizes ( isotropic ) partial flags of subspaces of a fixed vector space . </S>",
    "<S> in the mid 1990s , fulton , pragacz , and ratajski @xcite asked for global formulas which express the cohomology classes of the universal schubert varieties in flag bundles  when the space @xmath3 varies in an algebraic family  in terms of the chern classes of the vector bundles involved in their definition . </S>",
    "<S> this has applications to the theory of degeneracy loci of vector bundles and is closely related to the giambelli problem for the torus - equivariant cohomology ring of @xmath3 . in this expository article , we explain the answer to these questions which was obtained in @xcite , in terms of combinatorial data coming from the weyl group . </S>"
