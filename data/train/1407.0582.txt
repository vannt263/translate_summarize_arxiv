    "some interactions may be forbidden by time - reversal symmetry , possibly combined with other discrete symmetries , leading to a so - called symmetry protected topological phase @xcite .",
    "thus , the stability analysis is particularly relevant in this kind of theoretical modeling @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in our earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "a stability criterium based on symmetry arguments @xcite was generalized to time - reversal invariant topological insulators with non - abelian edge excitations ( see also @xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "we complement this analysis with the study of the allowed interactions .",
    "analogous analyses are currently developed for interacting two - dimensional topological superconductors @xcite and for two - dimensional systems on the surface of three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis of topological insulators was based on two approaches : the first used symmetry and topology arguments and the kramers theorem ; the second involved a systematic study of edge interactions that do not break time - reversal symmetry . in the first approach , pioneered by fu , kane and mele @xcite @xcite @xcite ,",
    "one considers the response of the system , say in the annulus geometry , to the insertion of flux quanta at the center  a refinement of the well - known laughlin argument for the quantized hall current @xcite @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of a single spinful free fermion mode , the addition of half flux @xmath4 let the ground state @xmath5 evolve into a spin @xmath6 neutral edge excitation , corresponding to a change of the @xmath0 index @xmath7 :    = 0 :  ( -1)^2s = 1  = :  ( -1)^2s=-1 .",
    "[ change s - p ] in time - reversal invariant systems , the kramers theorem implies that this edge state is degenerate with another @xmath6 state @xmath8 coming from the excitations ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this degeneracy is robust with respect to any perturbation that preserves time - reversal symmetry , and it implies that ground state and excitations at @xmath9 are separated by a gap @xmath10 , that vanishes in the large volume limit .",
    "therefore , the time - reversal invariant topological insulator of one free fermion has gapless edge excitations and is topologically non trivial .",
    "the argument clearly extends to @xmath11 free fermion systems that are stable ( resp .",
    "unstable ) for @xmath11 odd ( even ) .",
    "the flux insertion argument was generalized by levin and stern @xcite to systems with abelian edge excitations , that can be described by multicomponent luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 index was show to extend as follows : ( -1)^2s , 2s= , [ ls - index ] where @xmath12 is the hall filling fraction and @xmath13 is the minimal fractional charge , in units of @xmath14 , of one chiral component ( equivalently , the dimensionless ratio of the spin hall conductivity and minimal charge @xmath15 ) . in a system with anyonic excitations , the ratio ( [ ls - index ] ) correctly measures the spin @xmath16 of the smallest electron excitation created at the edge by adding half fluxes .",
    "an odd ( resp .",
    "even ) ratio corresponds to stable ( unstable ) systems , generalizing the number of fermion modes in the non - interacting case .",
    "the second stability analysis was based on studying the possible time - reversal invariant electron interactions at the edge @xcite @xcite .",
    "their general expressions in multi - component abelian systems can be written using vertex operators of the bosonic conformal field theory in the so - called @xmath17-matrix formalism .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the stability of the edge modes is again determined by the index ( [ ls - index ] ) : when this is positive , i.e. the kramers degeneracy argument does not hold , there are enough interactions for gapping all edge modes ; conversely , if the index is negative , i.e. there is kramers degeneracy , one mode remains gapless . in conclusion ,",
    "both approaches of studying flux insertions and interactions led to the same conclusions about the stability of topological insulators with abelian edges .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we were able to extend the first kind of stability analysis to topological insulators involving pairs of non - abelian edge excitations , like the pfaffian @xcite , the read - rezayi @xcite and the non - abelian spin singlet states @xcite .",
    "we first obtained the grand - canonical partition function of the conformal field theory describing chiral - antichiral pairs of edge excitations , by dwelling on earlier results @xcite @xcite .",
    "then , we used the partition function for discussing the flux argument in full generality for any interacting system .",
    "quantum hall edge states possess neutral modes that can be abelian or non - abelian .",
    "the corresponding conformal theories have the affine symmetry @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the charge symmetry and @xmath20 is another ( non - abelian ) symmetry characterizing the neutral part ( possibly a coset @xmath21 ) @xcite .",

    "this field can be used to build the partition function on the spacetime torus that is modular invariant , i.e. symmetric under discrete coordinate changes that respect the double periodicity @xcite .",
    "it was found that the partition function of any quantum hall state is uniquely determined by two inputs : the choice of neutral @xmath21 theory and of abelian field @xmath23 in the theory that represents the neutral part of the electron @xcite .",
    "the study of transformations of the partition function under flux insertions @xcite showed that the neutral sectors do not play any role , and that the stability depends on a pair of numbers @xmath24 parameterizing the charge spectrum , namely the value of the minimal charge , @xmath25 , and of the would - be chiral hall conductivity ( spin conductivity ) , @xmath26 .",
    "the minimal spin @xmath16 excitation created by flux insertions was found to match the levin - stern index ( [ ls - index ] ) , again 2s= = k , ( -1)^2s=(-1)^k .",
    "[ ls - index - k ] in particular , the simpler topological insulator made by a pair of pfaffian states is unstable , since it corresponds to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. to @xmath29 .    in the same paper , we emphasized that the change of index under flux insertions expresses a discrete @xmath0 anomaly , that is the non - conservation of the ( edge ) spin parity @xmath7 of the fermionic system @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "indeed , this anomaly is the remnant of the @xmath30 continuous anomaly of the spin hall effect after the inclusion of relativistic corrections , such as spin - orbit interaction , that break the spin conservation explicitly ( but keep time - reversal invariance ) @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the partition function under modular transformations was also analyzed @xcite . in presence of fermionic excitations",
    ", this function always possesses four parts ( spin sectors ) , called the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors and their tildes ; these are characterized by antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions for the fermion field in each direction @xcite .",
    "it was found that the half - flux insertions and the modular transformations @xmath31 and @xmath32 map the four spin sectors among themselves . in the case of unstable non - anomalous systems , time - reversal symmetry allows to sum the four sectors together , leading to the complete modular invariant @xmath33 ; on the contrary , in the presence of @xmath0 anomaly they can not be summed up , leading to four independent partition functions , as follows : z_ising&=&z^ns + z^ + z^r + z^ ,  k  even ,  unstable , z_tr&=&(z^ns , z^ , z^r , z^ ) , k  odd ,  stable .",
    "[ non-inv.pf ] therefore , the @xmath0 spin parity anomaly was associated to a discrete gravitational anomaly , i.e. to a lack of complete modular invariance of the torus partition function @xcite .      in our previous paper @xcite",

    ", we provide the expressions of a sufficient set of gapping interactions passing all physics tests .",
    "we use the known result that some non - abelian states can be described as projections of corresponding `` parent '' abelian states @xcite@xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath34 halperin state of distinguishable electrons is related to the pfaffian state by the projection onto states of identical electrons , e.g. by antisymmetrizing over wavefunction coordinates . since this projection does not affect the time - reversal symmetry of states and operators",
    ", it maps time - reversal invariant interactions between the two theories . clearly , the value of the levin - stern index is equal in the unprojected ( abelian ) and projected ( non - abelian ) theories @xcite . through this mapping",
    "the earlier study of abelian edge interactions @xcite @xcite @xcite can be extended to non - abelian cases , where it provides the possible electrons interactions .",
    "it turns out that these are not sufficient to completely gap the system , but further neutral quasiparticle interactions can be introduced that do this task when the levin - stern index is one .",

    "[ ] these interactions involve neutral , spinful and charged operators within each chirality , respectively . as in previous theories",

    "in this paper , we have found the edge interactions that can gap time - reversal invariant topological insulators made by chiral - antichiral pairs of non - abelian hall states . in the cases where the flux - insertion argument predicted the instability of the systems ,",
    "we find a sufficient set of interactions that actually let them decay . in case of stability , as e.g. the @xmath35 parafermionic read - rezayi states with @xmath186 odd , we found instead that the available interactions are not sufficient to gap the system completely .",
    "these results complement the stability analysis of our previous paper @xcite .",
    "that unstable topological insulators possess enough interactions for decaying could be considered as a natural result . however , in checking this property explicitly we found some interesting features of these models .",
    "firstly , we noticed that the spin sign in time - reversal transformations is carried by abelian conformal fields that can represent faithfully the spin parity @xmath7 .",
    "secondly , we observed that the expressions of interactions require normal ordering and that this procedure is free from ambiguities due to the electron field obeying abelian fusion rules ( a so - called simple current ) @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we found that neutral excitations are gapped by a quasiparticle interaction that is allowed and generically present in the low - energy limit of the theory .",
    "the physical origin of this interaction remains to be understood , since it does not correspond to electron scattering at impurities .",
    "our study of interaction was based on previous analyses of abelian theories combined with particular projections that relate abelian and non - abelian hall states @xcite @xcite .",
