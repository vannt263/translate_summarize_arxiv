    "hera is an @xmath0 collider which has especially high sensitivity to new particles coupling to lepton - quark pairs . in 1994",
    "- 97 hera collided 27.5 gev positrons on 820 gev protons . in 1998",
    "the proton energy was raised to 920 gev increasing the center - of - mass energy @xmath1 from 300 gev to 318 gev . in 1998 and in the first months of 1999 , hera ran with electrons . in",
    "may 1999 hera switched back to @xmath2 collisions .",

    "have been collected per experiment at hera-1 .",
    "no evidence of new physics has been observed in various models in inclusive analyses ( contact interactions , extra - dimensions , leptoquarks ) and exclusive analyses ( lepton - flavour violation , @xmath14-violating susy , excited fermions ) , therefore new constraints have been set .",
    "hera limits are seen to be competitive with and complementary to the lep and tevatron searches .",
    "the status of isolated lepton events with missing @xmath15 is still intriguing and will become clearer with the new hera-2 data .",
    "hera has been shutdown since fall 2000 for a general upgrade : new focussing magnets have been installed in order to increase the luminosity and many improvements have been performed in the detectors in order to increase their sensitivity . moreover ,",
    "the lepton beam will be longitudinally polarised in the h1 and zeus interaction regions .",
    "the first luminosity runs are predicted for beginning 2002 and hera-2 is expected to accumulate 1 @xmath16 in the next 5 years .",
    "the anticipated factor of ten increase in the integrated luminosity will give an outstanding discovery potential for hera .",
