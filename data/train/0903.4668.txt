    "soon after the discovery of superconductivity ( sc ) in doped @xmath8feaso ( @xmath8 = rare - earth element ) materials,@xcite investigations also focused on the structurally related @xmath9fe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds ( @xmath9 = alkaline , alkaline - earth , or rare - earth metal ) . in the latter structures , the fe@xmath0as@xmath0 slabs are separated only by single elemental @xmath9 layers.@xcite the compounds become superconductors if appropriately modified by substitutions on the @xmath9 site by alkali metals@xcite or direct substitution within the fe@xmath0as@xmath0 slab by co@xcite or ni.@xcite recently , also the appearance of sc upon substitution of as by p was reported.@xcite controlled tuning of the electronic structure by selective substitutions provides an opportunity to test and refine theoretical models since these substitutions can introduce charge carriers , modify the lattice parameters , and may significantly suppress the structural / magnetic transitions observed in the ternary parent compounds.@xcite    application of external pressure has been understood as a `` clean '' alternative to substitutions in tuning the electronic state .",

    "a feature common to both approaches ( chemical substitution or external pressure ) is the correlation of anisotropic changes in the crystal lattice with the suppression of the spin density wave ( sdw ) type of afm .",

    "would be strongly influenced by the choice of the particular supercell , especially for the larger ru content , we decided to compare the stability with respect to magnetism applying the fixed spin moment ( fsm ) approach ( cf .",

    "the resulting curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ figfsm ] .",
    "as one may expect , the magnetic moment and the energy gain due to magnetic ordering are reduced with increasing ru content @xmath7 .",
    "the destabilization is especially strong between @xmath78 , the fully ru substituted compound is clearly nonmagnetic . in accord with the classical stoner picture for itinerant magnets , the suppression of magnetism originates from a strong decrease of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level @xmath79 = 4.9 , 4.4 , 3.5 and 1.9 states/(ev f.u . ) for @xmath7 = 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , in agreement with experimental @xmath80 values ( table [ thetable ] ) .    in the real system ,",
    "the magnetism will be further destabilized due to the fe - ru disorder .",
    "in contrast to the co substituted compound , where the co and fe 3@xmath17 states are almost indistinguishable ( see inset of fig .  [ figfsm ] ) , the ru 4@xmath17 states differ considerably in the region close to @xmath81 .",
    "this difference has its origin in the different potential and lower site energy of ru with respect to fe . in turn",
    ", the distinct potential will be responsible for an enhanced scattering and therefore destabilize magnetic ordering . in",
    "the co substituted compound , however , only the shift of the fermi level due to the additional electron ( see fig .  [ figfsm ] ) leads to a nonmagnetic state .",
    "although our calculation illustrate semi - quantitatively the suppression of magnetism ( clearing the scene for incipient sc ) in srfe@xmath1ru@xmath2as@xmath0 , the real interplay between magnetism and the slight volume expansion for increasing ru content , accompanied by a reduction of the @xmath13 axis and small changes of the as @xmath26 position is rather complex : the volume expansion leads to narrower fe 3@xmath17 bands that would stabilize magnetic order , but due to the @xmath13 axis contraction these states are simultaneously shifted to lower energy resulting in a reduced dos at @xmath81 .",
    "however , the fe 3@xmath17 states are pushed up in energy upon substitution of ru due to the lower site energy of the ru 4@xmath17 states , compensating the reduction of @xmath79 partially .",
    "furthermore , the stoner factor @xmath82 for ru is significantly smaller than for fe , disfavoring magnetic order further .",
    "to sum up , we have shown that the partial isovalent substitution of ru for fe in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 suppresses the sdw transition and gives rise to bulk superconductivity .",
    "both end members of the series , srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 as well as srru@xmath0as@xmath0 , crystallize in the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 type structure ( @xmath24 ) and there is no indication of a change or of a superstructure for intermediate ru concentrations at the applied experimental conditions .",
    "this observation indicates that fe and ru are isovalent .",
    "the lattice parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 vary linearly but in opposite directions with @xmath7 .",
    "as seen from the ratio @xmath6 ( decreases by 15% for @xmath7 between 0 and 2 ) a strong anisotropic modification of the lattice ( a compression of the tetragonal cell along @xmath13 ) is introduced by the exchange of fe by ru .",
    "while @xmath83 does not change significantly with @xmath7 this implies a large change of the two different as  fe  as bonding angles .",
    "while for srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 these angles are quite similar ( 110.50 and 108.90@xmath18 ) they deviate quite strongly in srru@xmath0as@xmath0 ( 119.43 and 104.73@xmath18).@xcite bulk superconductivity exists in this series for a @xmath6 ratio ( at room temperature ) around 3 .",
    "electronic properties like the high - temperature susceptibility also show a smooth variation with @xmath7 .",
    "whether any of these structural modifications is of special importance for the occurrence of superconductivity in srfe@xmath84as@xmath0-type substitution series remains to be determined .",
    "currently , it can be stated that electron doping by co ( or ni ) is much more efficient in order to suppress the sdw and allowing for a superconducting ground state than a compression of the cell along @xmath13 .",

    "for the bafe@xmath1(co , ni , cu)@xmath2as@xmath0 systems a first attempt in this direction was presented recently.@xcite also , it is desirable to measure the compressibility of the compounds under hydrostatic pressure . only such data would allow a comparison of pressure experiments with chemical substitutions studies .",

    "for some of these systems the electronic state was already addressed by dft methods.@xcite experimentally , it appears that the critical temperatures are generally limited to @xmath87k and that only for isovalent substitution ( _ viz .",
    "_ ru ) the required level of substitution is such high as reported here .",
