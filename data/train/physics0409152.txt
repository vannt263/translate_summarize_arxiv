    "spin is an essential and fascinating complication in the physics of quantum collision theory as well as in many fields of physics .",
    "the spin of a particle is a quantum mechanical attribute .",
    "therefore , questions about the spin dependence of atomic reactions tend to probe the underlying theoretical structure very deeply . on the particle side ,",
    "the technology of spin measurement has improved dramatically over the past years [ 1 - 2 ] .",
    "improvement in polarized sources allow to produce successfully polarized gas whereas polarized electrons and positrons in ( @xmath1 ) colliders are commonplace .",
    "this area of study has served as a crucial testing grounds in elementary particle physics and in atomic scattering theories and experiments .",
    "methods that have passed this test successfully are now being widely used for a series of practical applications as well .",
    "these include the production of atomic data for the modelling of fusion plasma , as well as data needed for astrophysics and laser physics . in this contribution , we begin by a simple introduction to the process of mott scattering , one the most important techniques in polarized electron studies [ 3 ] . whenever the spin direction plays a role , one has to average over all spin orientations in order to describe the experiments properly . only in recent years",
    "has it been found possible to produce electron beams in which the spin has a preferential orientation .",
    "they are called polarized electrons beams [ 4 ] in analogy to polarized light in which it is the field vectors that have a preferred orientation .",
    "there are many reasons for the interest in polarized electrons .",
    "one important reason is that in physical experiments one endeavors to define as exactly as possible the initial and/or final states of the systems being considered .",
    "moreover experiments on laser - induced process in strong laser fields well beyond the atomic field strength intensity of about @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 have clearly given evidence of relativistic effects [ 5 ] .",
    "however , the search for spin - specific effects has been rare [ 6]-[7 ] .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to add some new physical insights and to show that the modification of the polarization degree due to the presence of a strong laser field can provide ( or not ) a clear signature of spin effects in electron - laser interaction . before we present the results of our investigation concerning laser - assisted mott scattering of polarized electrons , we first begin by sketching the principal steps of our treatment . as many atomic and laser physicists are unfamiliar with the relativistic formalism",
    "that is very often given in natural units ( @xmath5 ) widely used in elementary particle physics , we begin by the most basic results of mott scattering of polarized electrons in the absence of the laser field using atomic units ( @xmath6 ) . in atomic units ,",
    "one has ( @xmath7 ) where @xmath8 is the electron rest mass . throughout this work",
    ", we shall use atomic units and work with the metric tensor @xmath9 . then , in the presence of a laser field , we compare the results obtained with those obtained in the absence of the laser field .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the scattering of polarized electrons by a coulomb field in the absence of the laser field and we introduce the concept of polarized differential cross section ( polarized dcs ) as well as the helicity flip polarized dcs and the helicity non - flip dcs . we also define the degree of polarization of the scattered electrons . at this stage , it is important to remark that in many experiments [ 8 ] , the degree of polarization of the scattered electrons is measured . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the laser - assisted mott scattering of polarized electrons in the presence of a laser field . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the results we have obtained and we end by a brief conclusion in section v. we hope to offer a simple pedagogical treatment of spin in relativistic atomic collisions that strips it of its unnecessary mystery . our approach based upon the helicity formalism leads to a unified treatment that can be applied to other relativistic atomic scattering processes in the absence or in the presence of a laser field .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize the following : the spin polarization state of a dirac particle has not to be confused with the polarization of the laser field ( which can be linear , circular or elliptical ) used to describe the process let aside with the number @xmath10 of photons exchanged between the dirac particles and the laser field .",
    "let us consider one of the simplest process of qed [ 9 ] namely the coulomb scattering of electrons .",
    "we calculate the scattering of electrons at a fixed coulomb potential in the first born approximation .",
    "the transition matrix element for this process is    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the dirac wave function describing the incident electron normalized to the volume @xmath13 , and where @xmath14 describes the scattered electron and is also normalized to the volume @xmath13 .",
    "the free spinors @xmath15 are normalized according to @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ". the coulomb potential @xmath18 is generated by a static nucleus of charge ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 then @xmath21 and @xmath0 simply reads @xmath22 performing the integrals over @xmath23 and @xmath24 gives @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "+ using the standard procedures of qed [ 9 ] , one finds for the unpolarized dcs @xmath27 evaluated for @xmath28 . this in turn implies @xmath29 the unpolarized dcs is then given by summing the dcs over the final spin polarizations @xmath30 and then averaging over the initial spin polarizations @xmath31 it is straightforward to show that @xmath32 or with the notational conventions we have adopted @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scattering angle . using @xmath35 and @xmath36 = @xmath37",
    ", one finally finds for the unpolarized dcs @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the unpolarized rutherford dcs obtained in the limit @xmath40 ( small velocities ) . up to now , all calculations have been carried out with the assumption that the electron spin is not observed . in",
    "what follows , we shall calculate the scattering of polarized dirac particles . but",
    "first , let us review the basics needed for the description of spin polarization [ 9 ] .",
    "free electrons with four - momentum @xmath41 and spin @xmath42 are described by the free spinors @xmath15 , the vector @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) is a lorentz vector in a frame in which the particle moves with momentum @xmath46 .",
    "one easily checks the normalization condition @xmath47 and the orthogonality condition @xmath48 we introduce the spin projection operator @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "this operator has the properties that @xmath51 one can also apply this formalism to helicity states where the spin points in the direction of the momentum @xmath46 @xmath52 we can then define a four spin vector @xmath53 the starting point of our calculation is the dcs for coulomb scattering of an electron with well defined momentum @xmath54 and well defined spin @xmath55 . if also the final spin @xmath30 is measured , the polarized dcs then reads @xmath56 evaluated for @xmath57 @xmath58 . introducing the operators @xmath59    @xmath60    we obtain for the polarized dcs    @xmath61    using the relations @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , one finally obtains @xmath65.\\label{24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so",
    "if during the process , there is a helicity flip @xmath66 , we obtain for the helicity flip polarized dcs @xmath67 if there is no helicity flip @xmath68 and the helicity non flip polarized dcs is given @xmath69 of course , one must have @xmath70 noting that @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 and we end up with @xmath73 now , we introduce the degree of polarization @xmath74 which is defined by @xmath75 for our process , this degree of polarization reads @xmath76 remarking that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the relativistic parameter @xmath79 , we obtain for @xmath74 @xmath80 so , for the process of mott scattering in the absence of the laser field , only two parameters are relevant , the relativistic parameter @xmath78 and the scattering angle @xmath81 . to end this section , let us remark that the kinetic energy of the incident electron is given by @xmath82",
    "let us consider the simple case where the linearly polarized laser field is described by the four potential @xmath83 with @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the frequency and the wave vector of the laser field respectively .",
    "the electron is described by the dirac -volkov wave function [ 10 ] solution of the dirac equation in the presence of a laser field having the following form @xmath87 with @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the averaged squared potential .",
    "we turn now to the calculation of the transition amplitude .",
    "the interaction of the dressed electron with the central coulomb field @xmath91 is considered as a first order perturbation .",
    "this is well justified if @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the atomic number and @xmath94 is the fine structure constant .",
    "then , the transition matrix element for the transition @xmath95 is @xmath96 let us consider the term @xmath97\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\gamma ^{0}\\left [ 1+c(p_{i}){k\\!\\!\\!/}{a\\!\\!\\!/}_{1}\\cos ( \\phi ) \\right]\\frac{u(p_{i},s_{i})}{\\sqrt{2q_{i}v } } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\exp ( -i(q_{i}-q_{f}).x - iz\\sin ( \\phi ) ) \\label{40}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath98 transforming the terms containing products of dirac gamma matrices and invoking the well known result for ordinary bessel functions @xmath99}=\\sum_{n=-\\infty } ^{+\\infty } j_n(z)e^{(-in\\phi ) } , \\ ] ] one ends up with @xmath100 with @xmath101 where @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given by @xmath106 \\\\",

    "( [ 21]),([22 ] ) @xmath110 with    @xmath111    in equations ( [ 47 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) @xmath112 using reduce [ 11 ] , one finds that the polarized dcs @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are given by @xmath116    @xmath117    these coefficients are very lengthy and can be found in the appendix .",
    "so , the helicity non flip polarized dcs is @xmath118    @xmath119    and the helicity non flip polarized dcs is @xmath120    @xmath121    therefore , we obtain for the degree of polarization @xmath122 it is easy to show both analytically and numerically that the unpolarized dcs given in ( [ 45 ] ) is such that    @xmath123",
    "we begin our discussion by one of the most fundamental result concerning the degree of polarization in the non relativistic regime .",
    "as it is well known , this degree is close to @xmath124 , the scattering angle .",
    "this degree varies from @xmath125 to @xmath126 as the scattering angle @xmath127 varies from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 , the behavior of @xmath130 as well as that of the degree of polarization . we obtain two very close curves , which was to be expected . with increasing values of the relativistic parameter @xmath131 , i.e",
    "when the collision becomes more relativistic , the degree of polarization becomes less strongly angle dependent and approaches a constant value @xmath132 as @xmath133 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "all these results are consistent with well known results of qed [ 9 ] and to compare with results in presence of the laser field , one has to bear in mind that the laser field dresses the angular coordinates [ 12 ] of the incident and scattered electrons so instead of plotting the degree of polarization as a function of the angle @xmath134 , one has to plot it as a function of the angle @xmath135 of the scattered electron .",
    "the geometry we have chosen both for the non relativistic and relativistic regimes is the following : the angles of the incident electron are @xmath136 and @xmath137 while the angles of the scattered electron are @xmath138 with @xmath135 varying from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "there is still a very good agreement between the degree of polarization @xmath74 and @xmath124 but with the difference that now the maximum and minimum are no longer @xmath125 and @xmath126 but nearly @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "as the energy is increased , we observe the same phenomenon as previously mentioned , that is , the degree of polarization approaches the same constant value @xmath126 and becomes less angle dependent as this is shown in fig .",
    "one of the most striking effect we shall soon encounter in the next section is that the laser field has a very negligible influence on the degree of polarization while it has an influence on the polarized dcss .",
    "+ remark : in figures ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) we have plotted the degree of polarization and @xmath141 as functions of the angle @xmath135 varying from @xmath142 to @xmath129 since there is a complete symmetry between its behavior from @xmath142 to @xmath129 and from @xmath128 and @xmath142 .      when a laser field is present , one has to be careful to distinguish between two regimes , the non relativistic regime and the relativistic regime .",
    "the non relativistic regime corresponds to a relativistic parameter @xmath143 where the curves for the relativistic and non relativistic kinetic energies of a particle begin to be distinguished .",
    "we recall that @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the velocity of the particle and @xmath146 is the velocity of light in the vacuum . in this regime ,",
    "the electric field strength is @xmath147 and the laser frequency is @xmath148 which corresponds to a laser photon energy of @xmath149 .",
    "the relativistic regime corresponds to a relativistic parameter @xmath150 . in this regime ,",
    "the electric field strength is @xmath151 and we retain the same laser frequency as previously .      in this regime",
    ", one expects that the dressing of angular coordinates of @xmath152 and @xmath153 as well as those of @xmath154 and @xmath155 will not be important and this is indeed the case .",
    "while the helicity non flip polarized differential cross section ( in short dcs @xmath156 ) and the helicity flip polarized differential cross section ( dcs @xmath157 ) are influenced by the number of photons exchanged , it is not the case for the degree of polarization which remains nearly constant until the cut off is reached .",
    "we recall that when the cut off is reached , the various dcss do not vary anymore since the arguments of the ordinary bessel functions become close to their indices [ 7 ] .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "5 where we give the three dcss : dcs @xmath156 , dcs @xmath157 and the unpolarized dcs . for every simulation and for any number of photons",
    "exchanged , the sum of dcs @xmath156 and dcs @xmath157 always gives the unpolarized dcs . in fig .",
    "5 , the number of photons exchanged is @xmath158 and the various dcss are reduced .    in fig .",
    "6 , we give the corresponding degree of polarization and there is no difference between this degree of polarization and that shown in fig .",
    "3 . when the number of photons exchanged reaches the cut off , which in the non relativistic regime is @xmath159 , the three dcss increase as shown in fig . 7 but the degree of polarization do not increase at all .    , dcs @xmath157 and unpolarized dcs scaled in @xmath160 as functions of the angle @xmath161 in degree for an exchange of @xmath159 photons . , width=226,height=240 ]    it is still close to @xmath124 and increasing the number of photons has no influence on its value .",
    "if such a behavior holds for the relativistic regime , then at least to first order in perturbation theory , we can draw the following conclusions : while the various dcss are reduced by the influence of the laser field with increasing values of the field strength as well as the incoming electron relativistic kinetic energies , the corresponding degrees of polarization are almost insensitive to the presence of the laser field or in other terms to the number of photons exchanged .      in this regime",
    ", the cut off is @xmath162 photons that can be exchanged with the laser field and the corresponding dcss are reduced .",
    "they are of the order @xmath163 ( for the laser free case they are of the order @xmath164 ) and we show in fig .",
    "8 the behavior of the three dcs . as the energy of the incident electron",
    "is increased ( and also the electric field strength ) , the helicity flip polarized differential cross section ( dcs @xmath157 is almost negligible , showing that the leading process in this regime is likely to favor the helicity non flip polarized differential cross section dcs @xmath156 . for an exchange of @xmath158 photons and for an exchange of @xmath165 photons ,",
    "the situation remains the same as to the relative importance of the two dcss .",
    "the increase in the value of the dcs @xmath156 ) is simply due to the fact that we have summed over @xmath166 photons and this can be shown in fig .",
    "on the other hand , there is absolutely no change in the degree of polarization even if we sum over a much larger number of photons .",
    "this is due to the fact that the degree of polarization @xmath74 can be written as @xmath167 and that the second term in the above equation is independent with respect of the number of photons exchanged .",
    "once again , one can not distinguish between the degree of polarization corresponding to an exchange of @xmath158 photons and @xmath166 .",
    "this degree of polarization is shown in fig .",
    "finally , some observations have to be made concerning the ultra relativistic regime which corresponds to a relativistic parameter @xmath168 and an electric field strength @xmath169 . in that case",
    ", the cut off is very high , namely of the order of @xmath170 photons exchanged and due to a lack of high speed computing facilities , we can not sum over a very large number of photons .",
    "however , the same conclusion holds for the degree of polarization , which is insensitive to the number of photons exchanged . in figure ( 11 ) , we compare the laser free degree of polarization and the degree of polarization for an exchange of @xmath171 photons .",
    "the curves are very close .",
    "the independence of the degree of polarization with respect to the number of photons exchanged has been checked for various geometries leading always to the same aforementioned conclusion except for the well known case of elastic forward scattering where there is a divergence of the dcs .",
    "for this particular geometry , @xmath172 and @xmath137 while the angles of the scattered electron are @xmath173 with @xmath135 varying from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .      in this work ,",
    "we have studied the behavior of the three dcss ( the helicity non flip polarized differential cross section , the helicity flip polarized differential cross section and the unpolarized differential cross section ) in the absence and in presence of a linearly polarized laser field .",
    "we have mainly studied the non relativistic and the relativistic regime and in all cases , the sum of the two polarized differential cross sections always gives the unpolarized differential cross section while the degree of polarization is independent with respect to the number of photons exchanged and is very close to the laser free degree of polarization .",
    "these results have been obtained in the first order of perturbation theory and are valid for a very wide range of angular geometries .",
