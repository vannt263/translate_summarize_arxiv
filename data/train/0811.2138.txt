    "the mst most closely associated with @xmath0 is that of cheng , gunion , han , marandella , mcelrath ( cghmm ) @xcite which describe counting solutions at assumed values for the mass for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 . by incorporating a minimization or maximization ,",
    "we enhance cghmm s approach because we have a variable whose value changes slightly with slight changes of the inputs instead of the binary on - off that cghmm have with the existence of a solution . as a hybrid technique",
    ", we also incorporate knowledge of the added information from other measurements which accurately determine the mass differences .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath0 can form a distribution whose shape tells us information about the masses . because for most events there is only one  turn - on \" point below @xmath52 , the distribution @xmath26 is very similar to the derivative of the fig .",
    "8 of cghmm@xcite to the left of their peak and @xmath27 is similar to the negative of the derivative to the right of their peak .",
    "they differ in that there may be multiple windows of solutions ; also cghmm s fig .",
    "8 is not exactly along the line of fixed mass differences ; and the effect of backgrounds and energy resolution are dealt with differently .",
    "we also hope to show that the use of the distribution s shape enables us to exploit the essentially non - existent dependence of the distributions on the unknown collision energies and incorporate the dependency on utm directly .",
    "this diminishes the dependence of the measurement on the unknown model while still allowing us to exploit the majority of the distribution shape in the mass determination .",
    "after studying previous msts , we were tempted to use bayes theorem with a parton distribution function as a likelihood function as was done in goldstein and dalitz @xcite and kondo , chikamatsu , kim @xcite ( gdkck ) .",
    "they used the parton distribution function to weight the different mass estimates of the top - quark mass ( @xmath52 in our topology ) .",
    "we found that such a weighting leads to a prediction for @xmath52 much smaller than the true value .",
    "this can be understood because the parton distributions make collisions with smaller center - of - mass energies ( small @xmath62 ) more likely , therefore the posterior will prefer smaller values of @xmath52 which are only possible for smaller values of @xmath62 .",
    "only if one includes the cross section for production , i.e. the likelihood of the event existing at all , in the bayes likelihood function will we have the appropriate factor that suppresses small values of @xmath62 and therefore small values of @xmath52 .",
    "this balance therefore leads to the maximum likelihood ( in the limit of infinite data ) occurring at the correct @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately , inclusion of the magnitude of the cross section introduces a large model dependence . in the case of the top - quarks mass determination ,",
    "the gdkck technique gives reasonable results .",
    "this is because they were not scanning the mass scale , but rather scanning @xmath63 ( the top - quark mass ) while assuming @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the likelihood of solutions as one scans @xmath63 rapidly goes to zero below the true top - quark mass @xmath66 .",
    "the parton distribution suppresses the likelihood above the true @xmath66 .",
    "the net result gives the maximum likelihood near the true top - quark mass but suffers from a systematic bias @xcite@xcite that must be removed by modeling @xcite .",
    "one major advantage of using the @xmath0 distribution ( just as the @xmath7 distribution @xcite@xcite ) is that the bulk of the relevant events are used to determine the mass and not just those near the end point . to make the approach mostly model independent , we study on what factors the distributions shape depends .",
    "we show that there is a strong dependence on utm , but because the utm distribution can be measured from the data this does not increase the model dependency .",
    "we show there is no numerically significant dependence on the collision energy which is distributed according to the parton distribution functions .",
    "this makes the distribution shape independent of the production cross section and the details of what happens upstream from the part of the decay chain that we are studying .",
    "we model these effects with a simple mathematica monte carlo event generator assuming @xmath55 gev , @xmath67 gev , and @xmath68 gev .    * * effect of combinatorics ambiguities *    just as in the topology in refs  @xcite@xcite studied earlier , where @xmath1 decays via a three body decay , the branch assignments can be determined by either distinct ossf pairs or by studying which ossf pairs have both @xmath69 . in @xmath70 of the events , there is only one combination that satisfy @xmath69 .",

    "<S> we further develop the constrained mass variable techniques to determine the mass scale of invisible particles pair - produced at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the constrained mass variable @xmath0 which provides an event - by - event lower bound and upper bound to the mass scale given the two mass differences between the lightest three new particle states . </S>",
    "<S> this variable is most appropriate for short symmetric cascade decays involving two - body decays and on - shell intermediate states which end in standard - model particles and two dark - matter particles </S>",
    "<S> . an important feature of the constrained mass variables is that they do not rely simply on the position of the end point but use the additional information contained in events which lie far from the end point . to demonstrate our method we study the supersymmetric model sps 1a . </S>",
    "<S> we select cuts to study events with two @xmath1 each of which decays to @xmath2 , and two opposite - sign same - flavor ( ossf ) charged leptons through an intermediate on - shell slepton . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with @xmath3 of integrated luminosity the invisible - particle mass can be measured to @xmath4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> combining fits to the shape of the @xmath0 constrained mass variable distribution with the @xmath5 edge fixes the mass differences to @xmath6 gev . </S>"
