    "in conventional ofdm signaling , subsequent symbols are separated by guard intervals , which are usually implemented as cyclic prefixes ( cps ) @xcite . by this , linear convolution of the signal with the channel impulse response is transformed into a cyclic convolution which allows for a low complex equalization in frequency domain . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use known sequences , which we call unique words ( uws ) , instead of cyclic prefixes .",
    "the technique of using uws had already been investigated in - depth for sc / fde systems , where the introduction of unique words in time domain is straight forward @xcite , since the data symbols are also defined in time domain . in this paper , we will show how unique words can be introduced in ofdm time domain symbols , even though the data qam ( quadrature amplitude modulation ) symbols are defined in frequency domain .",
    "furthermore , we will introduce an optimized receiver concept adjusted to the novel transmit signal structure .",
    "figure [ fig : cp_uw ] compares the transmit data structure of cp- and uw - based transmission in time domain @xcite .",
    "both structures make sure that linear convolution of an ofdm symbol with the impuls response of a dispersive ( e.g. multipath ) channel appears as a cyclic convolution at the receiver side .",
    "nevertheless , there are also some fundamental differences between cp- and uw - based transmission :        * the uw is part of the dft ( discrete fourier transfom)-interval , whereas the cp is not . *",
    "the cp is random , whereas the uw is a known deterministic sequence .",
    "therefore the uw can advantageously be utilized for synchronization @xcite and channel estimation purposes @xcite .",
    "both statements hold for ofdm- as well as for sc / fde - systems .",
    "however , in ofdm - different to sc / fde - the introduction of uws in time domain leads to another fundamental and beneficial signal property :    * a uw in time domain generates a word of a complex number rs - code ( cf .",
    "e. g. @xcite ) or of a specific coset to such a code in frequency domain , i.e along the subcarriers .",
    "therefore , the uw could be exploited for error correction or ( more appropriate ) for erasure correction for highly attenuated subcarriers .",
    "another interpretation of this fact which we prefer here , is an introduction of correlations along the subcarriers .",
    "these correlations can advantageously be used as a - priory knowledge at the receiver to significantly improve the ber ( bit error ratio ) behavior in frequency selective environments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe our approach of how to introduce unique words in ofdm symbols .",
    "section iii introduces an lmmse ( linear minimum mean squared error ) receiver that exploits the a - priory knowledge introduced at the transmitter side . in section iv the novel uw - ofdm concept is compared to the classical cp - ofdm by means of simulation results . for this",
    ", the ieee 802.11a wlan ( wireless local area networks ) standard serves as reference system .",
    "_ notation _    lower - case bold face variables ( @xmath0 , ... ) indicate vectors , and upper - case bold face variables ( @xmath1 , ... ) indicate matrices . to distinguish between time and frequency domain variables , we use a tilde to express frequency domain vectors and matrices ( @xmath2 , ... ) , respectively . we further use @xmath3 to denote the set of complex numbers , @xmath4 to denote the identity matrix , @xmath5 to denote transposition , @xmath6 to denote conjugate transposition , and @xmath7 $ ] to denote expectation .",
    "in conventional cp - ofdm , the data vector @xmath8 is defined in frequency domain .",
    "typically , zero subcarriers are inserted at the band edges and at the dc - subcarrier position , which can mathematically be described by a matrix operation @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 consists of zero - rows at the positions of the zero - subcarriers , and of appropriate unit row vectors at the positions of data - subcarriers .",
    "the vector @xmath13 denotes the ofdm symbol in frequency domain . the vector of time domain samples @xmath14 is calculated via an idft ( inverse dft ) operation , which can conveniently be formulated in matrix notation by @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the @xmath17-point - dft matrix defined by @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and with @xmath22 .",
    "we now modify this conventional approach by introducing a pre - defined sequence @xmath23 with @xmath24 , which we call unique word , and which shall form the tail of the time domain vector , which we now denote by @xmath25 .",
    "hence , @xmath25 consists of two parts and is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath24 .",
    "the vector @xmath23 represents the uw of length @xmath28 , and thus only @xmath29 is random and affected by the data . in order to simplify subsequent descriptions , but w.l.o.g .",
    "we use a two - step approach for the so - defined vector @xmath25 :    * in a first step we will generate a zero uw @xmath30 such that @xmath15 . * in a second step we will determine the transmit symbol by @xmath31    we now describe the first step in detail : as in conventional ofdm , the qam data symbols and the zero - subcarriers are specified in frequency domain in vector @xmath13 , but here in addition the zero - word is specified in time domain as part of the vector @xmath32 . as a consequence , the linear system of equations @xmath33 can only be fulfilled by reducing the number @xmath34 of data subcarriers , and by introducing a set of redundant subcarriers instead .",
    "we let the redundant subcarriers form the vector @xmath35 , further introduce a permutation matrix @xmath36 , and form an ofdm symbol ( containing @xmath37 zero - subcarriers ) in frequency domain by @xmath38 we will detail the reason for the introduction of the permution matrix and its specific construction shortly below .",
    "figure [ fig : uw_ofdm_overview ] illustrates this approach in a graphical way : the input of the idft block is composed of data subcarriers ( @xmath39 ) , zero subcarriers , and redundant subcarriers ( @xmath40 ) , which are distributed over the entire non - zero part of vector @xmath13 as specified by the permutation matrix @xmath41",
    ". the output of the idft block , which corresponds to the vector @xmath32 of time domain samples of an ofdm symbol , is composed of the random part @xmath29 , and the zero uw @xmath42 .        by inserting equation ( [ equ:2 ] ) into ( [ equ:1 ] )",
    ", the relation between the time and the frequency domain representation of the ofdm symbol can be written as @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 are appropriate sized sub - matrices , it follows that @xmath46 , and hence @xmath47 . with the matrix @xmath48 ( @xmath49 )",
    ", the vector of redundant subcarriers can thus be determined by the linear mapping @xmath50 which ( despite of the permutation ) exactly corresponds to a complex number rs - code construction along the subcarriers ( i.e. @xmath28 subsequent zeros in the transform domain ) .",
    "we summarize , that the idft of a frequency domain vector as given in equation ( [ equ:2 ] ) , which is composed of a data part @xmath39 , a set of zero - subcarriers , and a part @xmath40 of redundant subcarriers , which is determined by equation ( [ equ:3 ] ) , results in a time domain vector , which features the zero uw @xmath42 at its tail .",
    "we notice that the construction of @xmath51 , and therefore also the variances of the redundant subcarriers highly depend on the positions of the redundant subcarriers within the entire frequency domain vector @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the permutation matrix @xmath41 has to be chosen carefully .",
    "we select @xmath41 such that @xmath52 becomes minimum @xcite .",
    "this provides minimum energy on the redundant subcarriers on average ( when averaging over all possible data vectors @xmath39 ) . in section [ sec : simulation_results ] we will specify the permutation matrix @xmath41 for our simulated system setup .    note that equation ( [ equ:3 ] ) introduces correlation in the vector @xmath13 of frequency domain samples of an ofdm symbol .",
    "this can advantageously be utilized in an optimized receiver structure as it will be shown in the next section . in the following we use the notation @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for the non - zero part of @xmath13 , such that @xmath56 .    in the second step the transmit symbol @xmath25",
    "is generated by adding the unique word as described in equation ( [ equ:6 ] ) .",
    "the frequency domain version @xmath57 of the uw is defined by @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath25 can also be written as @xmath59 ) .",
    "at the receiver side the uw may be exploited for error and/or erasure correction as usual for rs - codes . here , we restrict the explanations to an exploitation of correlations between subcarriers which proofed to be more appropriate , since the redundant subcarrier symbols - unlike the data symbols - usually do not fit to a discrete grid ( e.g. odd gaussian integers ) . after the transmission over a multipath channel and after the common dft operation , the non - zero part @xmath60 of a received ofdm frequency domain symbol can be modeled as @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes a cyclic convolution matrix with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 represents a noise vector with the covariance matrix @xmath65 .",
    "the multiplication with @xmath66 excludes the zero subcarriers from further operation .",
    "the matrix @xmath67 is diagonal and contains the sampled channel frequency response on its main diagonal .",
    "@xmath68 with @xmath69 is a down - sized version of the latter excluding the entries corresponding to the zero - subcarriers .",
    "the received symbol can therefore also be written as @xmath70 as usual for conventional ofdm , we propose to apply a zero forcing equalization by multiplying with @xmath71 from the left .",
    "this results in @xmath72 with the noise vector @xmath73 .",
    "after its usage for synchronization and/or channel estimation purposes , the uw can be extracted from further operation by @xmath74 we mention , that the influence of the uw could also already be eliminated earlier , by simply subtracting @xmath75 from @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath53 contains the data as well as the redundant subcarrier symbols .",
    "since the redundant subcarrier symbols have been calculated out of the data symbols by equation ( [ equ:3 ] ) , they are correlated with the data symbols and among each other .",
    "because of that we propose to apply an lmmse wiener smoother @xcite on @xmath77 , which results in the noise reduced estimate @xmath78 where @xmath79 denote the covariance matrices of @xmath53 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "let us take a closer look on these covariance matrices : @xmath81 \\nonumber \\\\                                                                  & = & e \\left[({\\mathbf}{u}{\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\mathbf{d } } } } ) ( { \\mathbf}{u}{\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\mathbf{d}}}})^h \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\                                                                  & = & e \\left[{\\mathbf}{u}{\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\mathbf{d } } } } { \\mathbf{\\tilde{\\mathbf{d}}}}^h { \\mathbf}{u}^h \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\                                                                  & = & { \\mathbf}{u } e \\left[{\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\mathbf{d } } } } { \\mathbf{\\tilde{\\mathbf{d}}}}^h \\right ] { \\mathbf}{u}^h . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming uncorrelated and zero - mean data qam symbols with variance @xmath82 , we obtain a constant matrix @xmath83 that has to be calculated only once and can be determined in advance , cf",
