    "in the past decades , great efforts have been made to extend information theory and its ramifications to quantum theoretical settings .",
    "in particular , quantum error correction has been an attractive field for both physicists and coding theorists . the most important class of quantum error - correcting codes ( quantum codes ) would be that of symplectic codes ( stabilizer codes )  @xcite .",
    "these codes have direct relations with codes over finite fields satisfying some simple constraints on orthogonality .",
    "this has allowed us to utilize many results from coding theory .",
    "for example , quantum codes constructible in polynomial time are presented in @xcite based on developments of algebraic geometry codes . in the present paper , we propose a method for concatenating quantum codes , which will be obtained by developing forney s idea of concatenated codes  @xcite . as applications , we will treat two complexity issues on quantum codes to be described below .",
    "the codes to be proposed in this paper fall in the class called calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) codes  @xcite or a closely related code class .",
    "css codes form a class of symplectic codes . according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , last paragraph ) , a css quantum code is succinctly represented as a pair of linear codes @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the dual of @xmath3 , and by @xmath4 , we mean that @xmath5 is a subgroup of an additive group @xmath3 .",
    "_ in this paper , any code pair written in the form @xmath0 is supposed to satisfy the constraint @xmath1 . _",
    "note that a css quantum code is a hilbert space associated with a code pair @xmath0 in the manner described in @xcite with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , we will keep the style  @xcite of not mentioning hilbert spaces as far as it is possible . for the original purpose of quantum error correction ,",
    "@xmath8 is used for bit - flip errors and @xmath9 for phase - shift errors .",
    "therefore , if codes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both good , the css quantum code specified by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is good .",
    "this paper presents a method for creating code pairs , @xmath10 , of relatively large lengths by concatenating shorter code pairs .",
    "the main technical problem to be resolved in this work is to concatenate code pairs in such a way that the resulting pair @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "our method for concatenation is applicable to any combination of a @xmath12-ary inner code pair , @xmath0 , and a @xmath13-ary outer code pair , @xmath14 , as far as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of information digits of the inner code pair @xmath0 .",
    "this generality is the same as forney s method has .    using this general method",
    ", we give solutions to two complexity issues on symplectic codes .",
    "one issue is on decoding complexity , and the other on complexity of code construction .",
    "the ability of error correction will be measured in terms of ( i ) the decoding error probability ( as usual in shannon theory ) for the first issue , and in terms of ( ii ) the minimum distance ( as usual in coding theory ) for the second .",
    "another related issue of construction complexity with ( i ) will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "regarding history of results on ( i ) , the existence of good css codes has been proved without regard to complexity issues .",
    "specifically , the rate @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the binary entropy function , was called the shannon rate in @xcite and a proof of the achievability of @xmath17 was given in @xcite , while the achievability of a smaller rate @xmath19 , @xmath20 , had been known  @xcite . here",
    ", the channel is @xmath21 , the binary symmetric channel of the probability of flipping bits @xmath22 .. for a more detailed description of the previous result  @xcite , we need the definition of achievability in section  [ ss : goal ] .",
    "the above description is for the simple case where @xmath23 in the setting of section  [ ss : goal ] . ]",
    "if a wider class of quantum codes are considered , higher rates are known to be achievable ( e.g. , by symplectic codes  @xcite or shannon - theoretic random codes  @xcite ) .",
    "however , none of these codes has a rich structure that allows efficient decoding .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the issue of constructing efficiently decodable css codes . by the proposed method of concatenation",
    ", we prove that the rate @xmath17 is achievable with codes for which the error pattern can be estimated in polynomial time .",
    "we remark another major approach , i.e. , that of low - density parity - check or sparse - graph codes had already been taken to construct css codes  @xcite .",
    "however , they did not give asymptotically good sparse - graph quantum codes but codes of particular lengths around @xmath24 .",
    "one of the authors  @xcite has even made a conjecture that any dual - containing sparse - graph codes may be asymptotically bad ; note a dual - containing code @xmath3 corresponds to a pair @xmath25 in our notation .",
    "moreover , the present work is different from @xcite in that the decoding error probability is evaluated without approximation or resort to simulation .    in the latter half of the paper",
    ", we will evaluate the minimum distance , ( ii ) , of concatenated css codes that are obtained with our general concatenation method .",
    "the main result of this part ( theorem  [ prop : gen ] ) parallels a known lower bound  @xcite to the largest minimum distance of classical constructible codes to some extent .",
    "regarding history of results on ( ii ) , the polynomial constructibility of classical codes was formulated and discussed in @xcite with the criterion of minimum distance .",
    "this problem formulation was brought into the realm of quantum coding in @xcite , which was followed by @xcite .",
    "we will evaluate the asymptotic relative minimum distance of concatenated css codes produced by the proposed method , and compare these codes with known ones to show improvement for a wide range .",
    "furthermore , a code construction known as steane s enlargement of css codes is combined with the proposed concatenation method , which will turn out to be effective .",
    "the present work is motivated by the observation  @xcite ( also described in @xcite ) that good code pairs @xmath0 , not the corresponding css quantum codes , are useful for quantum key distribution .",
    "we remark that for such cryptographic applications , we need only classical information processing , not quantum information processing .",
    "for example , in a well - known application to quantum key distribution  @xcite , we need quantum devices only for modulation .",
    "because of such background , the present work , in the previous version , used a formalism emphasizing cryptographic applications for presentation of results .",
    "however , the author follows reviewers comments that the results should be presented in the context of quantum error correction .",
    "still , the author remarks that the main result on efficient decoding ( theorem  [ th : performance ] ) applies both to quantum error correction and to communication over wiretapped channels .",
    "note that decoding ( recovery operation ) for a quantum code is given as a completely positive linear map , which is surely beyond classical information processing , and even if one could find some non - css - type quantum codes with efficient recovery operation , it would not imply theorem  [ th : performance ] , which claims that decoding of codes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , is classical information processing of polynomial complexity .",
    "the present paper was originally prepared as two seperate manuscripts to treat the two issues respectively , but they have been merged due to a request of the associate editor .",
    "we remark that the part treating the issue on minimum distance , starting from section  [ ss : mindis_intro ] , can be read independently from sections  [ ss : parity_check_m ] to [ ss : performance ] , which treat the issue on decoding .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ss : qc_cc ] , we fix our notation . in section  [ ss : goal ] , a main statement on efficient decoding is presented . in section  [ ss : ccc ] , concatenated css codes are defined . in sections  [ ss :",
    "dec][ss : synd_dec ] , a method for decoding is described .",
    "specifically , a decoding strategy is described in section  [ ss : dec ] , a needed fundamental lemma is given and proved in section  [ ss : ef ] and [ app : proof_expansion ] , respectively , and syndrome decoding for concatenated css codes is described in detail in section  [ ss : synd_dec ] .",
    "the statement in section  [ ss : goal ] is proved in section  [ ss : performance ] . in section  [ ss :",
    "mindis_intro ] , moving to the topic on ( ii ) , a useful metric for quotient spaces is reviewed .",
