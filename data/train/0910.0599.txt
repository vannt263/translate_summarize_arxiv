    "the strong force has been known for a long time as one of the four fundamental forces of nature . however , many of its features are still unknown .",
    "quarks are the fundamental and gluons are the mediating particles of the strong force .",
    "but , still no one knows the mechanism , which does not let them exist freely or in a color non - singlet state . today",
    ", no one doubts that qcd confines quarks .",
    "when we try to take two quarks apart , the potential between them increases linearly by distance .",
    "this is the behavior of the potentials at intermediate and large distances , where the coupling constant is large , such that the perturbative methods can not be used in this regime . besides lattice gauge theory which has been successful in producing the linear potential and",
    "therefore has confirmed confinement , there are some phenomenological models that try to explain the confinement mechanism . according to these models ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is filled by some special class of field configurations .",
    "one type of the candidates of these configurations are center vortices .",
    "these are line - like ( in three dimensions ) or surface - like ( in four dimensions ) objects , which carry a magnetic flux quantized in terms of the center elements of the gauge group .",
    "the vortex theory states that the area law for the wilson loop is due to the quantum fluctuation in the number of center vortices linking the loop .",
    "the thick center vortex model has been fairly successful to reproduce the potentials of heavy quarks and higher representation sources at intermediate and large distances .",
    "even though the perturbative method gives the coulombic contribution as a result of one gluon exchange at short distance , it would be very exciting if one could describe the potentials for all regimes with the same mechanism .",
    "the model of thick center vortices has been originally introduced @xcite as a simple model to calculate potentials between static sources .",
    "it gives a linear potential for intermediate distances and a correct asymptotic behavior for large distances . at intermediate distances , the string tensions for pairs of color sources in the group representation r , are proportional to the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operator of the representation , which is in agreement with the lattice calculations . at large distances ,",
    "the string tensions of zero @xmath0-ality representations are zero and the representations with the same non - zero @xmath0-ality acquire the same string tension . in this paper",
    ", we argue that , by modifying this model , one may even get a coulombic behavior at short distances . the strength of the coulombic part of the potential is proportional to the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator of the corresponding representation , as expected .",
    "we must mention that independent of this work , m. faber and d. neudecker are also working on the model to achieve a coulombic potential .",
    "the preliminary results of that study are presented in reference @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we review briefly both thin and thick vortices and discuss the characteristics of the potentials obtained by the thick center vortex model . in section three",
    ", we discuss the role of the trivial and non - trivial center elements on the potentials . in section four",
    ", we achieve the coulombic part of the potential by increasing the role of contributions close to the trivial center element and show that it is proportional to the casimir scaling .",
    "in the original vortex model @xcite , it has been shown that the non - trivial center elements of the gauge group are responsible for the linear behavior of the potentials at large distances . by removing the non - trivial center elements of the gauge group from the lattice configurations ,",
    "one would lose the linearity of the potentials @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is the wilson loop in the su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory , with the contour c , which encloses the minimal area",
    ". we may consider it as being constructed of two main parts : one which is responsible for the linear potentials for both intermediate and large distances , and another part which gives the short distance behavior , @xmath2<w_{0}(c)>. \\label{w}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 indicates the coulombic contribution and the exponential part leads to a linear potential .",
    "the center vortex model explains the linear behavior of the potential at intermediate and large distances by using the non - trivial center elements .",
    "therefore , according to this model , the trivial center element may not contribute to the linear part of the potential .",
    "but , we know from the lattice gauge theory that the whole gauge group gives the complete potential . so increasing the role of the trivial center element may lead to the proper short distance behavior .",
    "a wilson loop is a gauge invariant green function that describes the propagation of a static quark - antiquark pair , which is created within a distance @xmath4 at @xmath5 and propagates for the time @xmath6 .",
    "one may find the heavy quark potential @xmath7 by the wilson loop at large @xmath6 by @xmath8 when the wilson loop interacts with the vortex or in other words , when the vortex influences the worldline of the quark - antiquark potential , the average wilson loop obeys the area law fall off rule for large enough time .",
    "this behavior implies a linear potential .",
    "when the vortex is linked to a wilson loop , the minimal surface is pierced by a center vortex.in this case , one may insert a non - trivial center element @xmath9 of the su(@xmath0 ) gauge group for a thin vortex @xmath10\\rightarrow tr[uu ... \\exp[{\\frac{2\\pi i n } { n}}] ... u ] ,   \\qquad n=1,2 , \\cdots , n-1 . \\label{wu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the place of insertion of @xmath9 is arbitrary , since it commutes with all elements of the gauge group . if the minimal area is not pierced by any center vortex , a trivial center element , which is the unit matrix of the su(@xmath0 ) gauge group , is inserted .",
    "thus , it does not contribute to the potential .",
    "so far , only thin vortices were discussed .",
    "in fact , thin vortices give a correct linear potential at large distances .",
    "in general , the potential between two heavy sources is given by @xmath11 where the coefficient of the linear term @xmath12 is called the string tension .",
    "the potential of thin vortices behaves according to the @xmath0-ality of the representation at large distances .",
    "the @xmath0-ality of a representation is the number of boxes in the young tableau of the corresponding representation mod n. for zero @xmath0-ality representations , the string tensions at large distances are zero and the representations with the same non - zero n - ality get the same string tensions .",
    "the center vortex theory of quark confinement @xcite has received so many numerical supports @xcite . from this theory",
    "the lowest string tension for each n - ality is seen in the large distance limit due to screening .",

    "as one can see in the figure , a coulombic behavior appears at small distances for the second data set .",
    "therefore , with data set @xmath83 , we see clear evidence for coulombic behavior at short distances , due to the enhancement of the vortex effect especially the trivial center element in this regime .",
    "it is seen that by increasing the role of the trivial center element in the model of thick center vortices , @xmath84 of equation ( [ w ] ) is enhanced in the induced potential of the model .",
    "however , the linear potential at intermediate distances has lost its previous shape and some concavity is observed in that area . to overcome this problem and the fact that the length of the intermediate linear part has been decreased",
    ", we let the vortex core size fluctuate by varying the parameter @xmath44 with a gaussian distribution around an appropriate central value which gives the coulombic potential .",

    ". however , we have been very careful to not change the shape of the flux which leads to the coulombic behavior .",
    "this has been done by choosing a gaussian distribution for the parameter @xmath44 without the tails to avoid the core sizes which are far from the original values of the data set @xmath83 . with this trick",

    "we should mention that a vast variety of free parameters may lead to coulombic type potential , but the point is that we want to get casimir scaling for both short and intermediate distances .",
    "the appropriate parameters may suggest some real profiles for the vortices in agreement with lattice data .",
    "figures  [ su3 ] and [ su4 ] display the potentials for different representations including the fundamental representation for the su(3 ) and su(4 ) gauge groups .",
    "tables 1 and 2 show the results of fitting the model to equation  ( [ potential ] ) , for the gauge group su(3 ) and su(4 ) , respectively .",
    "qualitative agreement with casimir scaling is obtained for all the coefficients of the equation .",
    "the fact that we could fit the potentials with equation  ( [ potential ] ) , @xmath90 , and observing a rough agreement with casimir scaling could be an evidence of obtaining the coulombic behavior for the short distance .",
    "another interesting point is the approximate agreement of @xmath91 with casimir scaling .",
    "this term represents a perimeter term which its agreement with casimir scaling automatically happens if the casimir scaling holds for the coulomb and linear terms .",
    "finally we would like to mention that although the results are only roughly consistent with casimir scaling , the agreement is not worse than what we have found by using this model for su(@xmath92 ) and su(@xmath62 ) gauge groups potentials @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or even the original work obtained from the model for su(@xmath77 ) potentials @xcite .",
    "in fact , so far the results have been qualitatively in agreement with casimir scaling .",
    "however the main features of the potentials between static quarks including a coulombic behavior for short distances , linear potential at intermediate distances and correct large distance behavior based on the n - ality of the representations are obtained successfully by the thick center vortices model .",
    "we have tried to extend the thick center vortex model to find the potentials between heavy sources not only for intermediate and large distances , but also for short distances , where a coulombic behavior is expected .",
    "we have increased the role of vortex fluxes piercing wilson loops with contributions , which are close to the trivial center element . with this method",
    ", we obtain an appropriate potential for the short and intermediate distances . to obtain a convex potential and an acceptable size for the intermediate regime",
    ", the vortex core size has been fluctuated by using a gaussian distribution .",
    "the coulombic behavior can be obtained for several values of the free parameters of the chosen profile .",
    "however , the proportionality with casimir scaling is obtained by carefully chosen vortex core sizes and by fluctuations of them very smoothly .",
    "the requirement that the results agree with lattice calculations may lead to valuable information about the vortex profile , including the distribution and the vortex core size .",
