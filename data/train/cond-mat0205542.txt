    "it has been observed that the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of alkali atom gas becomes superfluid @xcite .",
    "superfluidity of this system is different from the previously known superfluid @xmath2he in many aspects .",
    "for example , the bec is a weak - coupling gas for which the gross - pitaevskii equation is applicable while superfluid @xmath2he is a strong - coupling system .",
    "one of the most remarkable differences is that the bec has spin degree of freedom originating from the hyperfine spin of the atom , and that this degree of freedom couples to external magnetic fields . accordingly",
    "the order parameter of the condensate is also controlled at will by external magnetic fields .",
    "superfluid @xmath3he also has similar internal degrees of freedom , which , however , are rather difficult to control by external fields @xcite .    taking advantage of this observation",
    ", we proposed a simple method to create a vortex in a bec with the hyperfine spin @xmath4 @xcite ; a vortex - free bec is intertwined topologically by manipulating the magnetic fields in the ioffe - pritchard trap to form a vortex with the winding number 2 .",
    "this is achieved by reversing the axial magnetic field adiabatically while the planar quadrupole field is kept fixed .    in the present paper",
    ", a similar scenario is analysed for a bec with @xmath0 , taking @xmath5rb as an example .",
    "the difference between the present case and that for @xmath4 will be emphasised in our analysis .",
    "in the next section , we briefly review the order parameter of bec with hyperfine spin @xmath0 and the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation which describes the time - evolution of the order parameter . in section 3 , the ground state order parameter of the bec in the weak - field seeking state confined in a harmonic potential is obtained .",
    "then the time - evolution of the condensate , as the axial field is adiabatically reversed , is studied by solving the gp equation numerically .",
    "cases with different reverse time are analysed to find the best possible reversing time for which the the fraction of the remaining condensate in the vortex state is maximised .",
    "it is shown that the condensate in the end of this scenario has the winding number 4 . in section 4 ,",
    "the gp equation is solved in the presence of an optical plug along the vortex axis .",
    "the bec remains in the @xmath1 weak - field seeking state , with respect to the local magnetic field , throughout the development , and hence no atoms will be lost during the formation of a vortex .",

    "then the components with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are in the weak - field seeking state ( wfss ) while those with @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in the strong - field seeking state ( sfss ) .",
    "the presence of two wfsss leads to an interesting two - component vortex that is not observed in @xmath4 bec as we see in the next section .",
