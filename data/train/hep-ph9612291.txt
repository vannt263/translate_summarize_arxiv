    "in this paper i review some of the recent developments in perturbative field theory at finite temperature that have come about by using effective field theory methods . in particular",
    ", we will be interested in the behavior of hadronic matter at high temperature .",
    "this means that the temperature is assumed to be much larger than the mass of the particles involved ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "another assumption is that the gauge coupling constant @xmath4 is small ( @xmath5 ) ; this allows us to define three energy scales that satisfy : @xmath6 .",
    "hadronic matter is expected to undergo a phase transition when @xmath7  mev between a low temperature phase in which it is confined in the form of hadrons and a high temperature phase in which quarks and gluons are deconfined .",
    "the latter phase , known as _ quark - gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) , can be studied by perturbative methods since the strong coupling constant @xmath8 is expected to be small at high temperature .",
    "later on , we will check the validity of this statement ; it happens that at temperatures of a few times @xmath9 , the strong coupling constant is not small enough to give rise to a convergent series in the case of the free energy .",
    "a field theory at high temperature may be described by a lagrangian in which the modes with zero matsubara frequency have been decoupled according to the appelquist - carazzone theorem  @xcite .",
    "since the resulting theory is 3-dimensional , this method is know as dimensional reduction  @xcite .",
    "an efficient approach consists of interpreting the dimensionally reduced theory as an effective field theory  @xcite whose parameters are to be computed as a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant of the original theory .",
    "this idea is very attractive when studying theories with fermions on the lattice : the dimensionally reduced theory does not contain fermions because they have been integrated out completely and this may simplify computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the effective theory can be determined by analytic methods .",
    "effective field theory methods have been applied to different problems .",
    "braaten  @xcite has resolved a longstanding problem involving the breakdown of the perturbation expansion for the free energy of qcd .",
    "braaten and nieto have determined the asymptotic behavior of the correlator of polyakov loops  @xcite .",
    "they have also used this method to carry out explicit calculations in @xmath0  @xcite and in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the problem of the finite @xmath10 electroweak phase transition has essentially been solved in  @xcite ; this work has recently been reviewed by shaposhnikov in an article  @xcite that is complementary to this review .",
    "andersen  @xcite has analytically computed the free energy of qed up to order @xmath11 and the electric screening mass of scalar qed up to order @xmath12 .",
    "arnold and yaffe  @xcite have proposed a rigorous nonperturbative definition of the debye screening mass in nonabelian gauge theories .",
    "recently , karsch  _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite have computed the nonperturbative contribution to the @xmath2-order term of the free energy of qcd  @xcite by using lattice simulations .",
    "also , the effective field theory approach has been applied to the study of the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite .",
    "the effective field theory approach is now a well - established perturbative method to study field theories at finite temperature .",
    "it is a useful tool for organizing calculations of high - order terms in the perturbation expansion and it is especially powerful in dealing with nonabelian gauge theories .",
    "it is also an important conceptual tool that explicitly separates the different energy scales . in this review",
    "i present some of the results of its application to qcd .",
    "there are two conceptual steps : first , the effective field theory is defined by computing its parameters by matching with the original theory ; second , the effective theory is used to study problems concerning the high temperature limit of the full theory .",
    "we will use dimensional reduction to construct an effective field theory of qcd whose parameters encode the physics from the scale @xmath10 ; this theory is called _ electrostatic qcd _ ( eqcd ) , because it consists of pure yang - mills in three dimensions plus a scalar field in the adjoint representation which is related to the static mode of the original chromelectric field .",
    "since , the effective mass of the scalar is of order @xmath13 and magnetostatic fields remain massless , we can use the decoupling theorem to construct another effective theory in which the scalar field is decoupled .",
    "we will end up with a pure yang - mills theory in three dimensions that is called _",
    "magnetostatic qcd _",
    "( mqcd ) because it is only made out of fields related to the magnetostatic modes of qcd ; its parameters encode the physics from the scale @xmath13 . in both eqcd and mqcd ,",
    "the effective lagrangian includes an infinite series of nonrenormalizable terms .",
    "one of the technically more involved problems in constructing the effective field theory is the evaluation of feynman diagrams . in",
    "what follows i will not give details of these calculations , i will just state the results of the integrals that are needed and give references , which are basically the appendices in  @xcite . in all other respects",
    "i will try to show the construction of the effective theory in detail .",
    "the next section reviews some concepts that are familiar in the context of quantum field theory at finite temperature ( more information can be found in the textbooks  @xcite ) , introduces the effective field theory approach for @xmath0 theory , and shows a complete calculation using its effective field theory . in sect",

    "the static properties of a system of particles in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath10 are obtained from the free energy density @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the partition function . all through this paper",
    ", we will use the imaginary - time formalism which is more suitable than the real - time formalism for studying static properties .",
    "the partition function of a theory for a field @xmath16 is , in general , of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the euclidean time and @xmath19 .",
    "also , @xmath16 satisfies periodic boundary conditions in @xmath18 if it represents a bosonic field or anti - periodic boundary conditions if it represents a fermionic field : @xmath20 these conditions allow us to expand @xmath16 in its fourier modes : @xmath21 the matsubara frequency of the @xmath22th mode is @xmath23 for bosons and @xmath24 for fermions .",
    "the term in  ( [ modes ] ) with @xmath25 is independent of the euclidean time @xmath18 .",
    "the mode with this zero matsubara frequency is called _",
    "static _ ; the rest of the modes involve @xmath18 and are called _",
    "nonstatic_.    the feynman rules are the same as in the euclidean field theory , except that , at finite temperature , the time - like component of the momentum is discrete : @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the loop integration over such a component is replaced by a sum and the rule for loops is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimension of the space and @xmath29 is an arbitrary renormalization scale .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is introduced so that , after minimal subtraction of the poles in @xmath31 due to ultraviolet divergences , @xmath29 coincides with the renormalization scale in the @xmath32 renormalization scheme .    for example , in the @xmath0 theory with a massless scalar field and interaction @xmath33 , described by the lagrangian @xmath34 the leading - order contribution to the self - energy for a particle of momentum @xmath35 is given by the tadpole diagram in fig .",

    "if we try to compute the next - order correction to the self - energy which is given by the fig .",
    "[ tadpole]@xmath39 , we will find out that it is infrared divergent .",
    "the same is true for the rest of the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ tadpole ] .",
    "this _ mild _ breakdown of the perturbative expansion may be cured by resumming the geometric series of diagrams with one - loop - tadpole insertions like those in the fig .",
    "[ tadpole ] .",
    "the result is finite and gives the self - energy at next - to - leading order in @xmath4 : @xmath40 the sum - integral may be found in  @xcite .",
    "we see that the perturbative series is not analytic in the coupling constant @xmath41 , but in @xmath4 .",
    "this is a general feature of the resummation of diagrams with insertions of the leading - order contribution of the self - energy .",
    "ultraviolet divergences are not a special issue at finite temperature . the very same counterterms that would regularize the theory at zero temperature regularize the finite temperature theory .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that a theory at finite temperature is defined in a 4-dimensional euclidean space whose time component is compactified into a circle of circumference @xmath42 .",
    "the short - distance behavior is not modified by this sort of compactification .",
    "let us consider the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem for a field theory at zero temperature .",
    "it states that for a renormalizable field theory with heavy fields ( let us say , with mass @xmath43 ) and light fields ( with mass @xmath44 ) , green s functions with typical momentum scale @xmath45 and that only involve light fields in the external legs may be computed without considering heavy field loops . up",
    "to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , such green s functions are described by the original lagrangian with the heavy fields removed , but with modified values for the coupling constants of the light fields . in this sense ,",
    "the heavy fields decouple from the light fields .",
    "the partition function of a field theory at finite @xmath10 may be written in terms of the fourier modes @xmath48 , defined in  ( [ modes ] ) , instead of @xmath49 : @xmath50 a propagator of the form @xmath51 can be associated with each mode and the corresponding matsubara frequency represents its mass . in this context ,",
    "all of the fermionic modes and the nonstatic bosonic modes have a mass of order @xmath10 , while the static bosonic modes are massless .    in the limit of high temperature ,",
    "nonstatic modes have a large mass of order @xmath10 when compared with static modes , which are massless ; therefore , the decoupling theorem suggests that they decouple .",
    "what remains is an effective theory of the static modes whose partition function is of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the effective lagrangian .",
    "the effective theory is defined in a 3 dimensional space ; this is why this procedure is known as _",
    "dimensional reduction_. note that all fermionic modes have masses of order @xmath10 and therefore are integrated out .",
    "there are no effective fields associated with them .",
    "their effects are all incorporated into the effective theory through the effective coupling constants for the bosonic modes .",
    "there is an important difference between the decoupling theorem applied to heavy fields at zero temperature and to dimensional reduction at high temperature  @xcite . for heavy fields at zero temperature ,",
    "the effective theory is usually taken to be renormalizable .",
    "it reproduces green s functions of the full theory to all orders in the coupling constant @xmath4 , up to corrections that fall like powers of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is possible to reproduce these corrections as well but only at the cost of introducing nonrenormalizable terms into the effective lagrangian .",
    "as we have seen for the @xmath33 theory at high temperature , perturbative corrections generate a mass @xmath55 for the field of order @xmath13 , while the nonstatic field has a mass @xmath56 of order @xmath10 .",
    "the renormalizable effective theory provided by the decoupling theorem reproduces green s functions only up to errors that fall like powers of @xmath47 , but in this case the errors correspond to powers of @xmath4 .",
    "thus the renormalizable theory does not reproduce the full theory to all orders in @xmath4 .",
    "landsman  @xcite has concluded that the validity of the decoupling theorem at finite @xmath10 depends on the theory under study and fails for qcd or @xmath0 theory .",
    "this is true only if dimensional reduction is taken in the restricted sense of reducing to a renormalizable effective theory .",
    "as in the case of heavy fields at zero temperature , corrections that fall like powers of @xmath47 can be reproduced by including nonrenormalizable terms in the effective theory .",
    "the effective lagrangian therefore has an infinite number of interaction terms ; only a few of them are renormalizable , while the rest are non - renormalizable .",
    "each term has a parameter that plays the role of an effective coupling constant .",
    "these parameters are not arbitrary coefficients but instead are completely determined by the condition that the effective theory matches the full theory at low momentum .",
    "these effective parameters can be calculated in powers of the coupling constant @xmath4 of the full theory . also , in general , the effective parameters depend on an ultraviolet cutoff that cancels the ultraviolet cutoff dependence of the loop integrals in the effective theory . in calculations of a physical quantity to a given order in @xmath4",
    ", only a finite number of these parameters will enter . at low orders in @xmath4 ,",
    "it is sometimes possible to truncate the effective theory to the renormalizable terms or even to the super - renormalizable terms .      in this subsection",
    "we will explicitly construct the effective field theory of a massless field with self - interaction @xmath33 described by the lagrangian  ( [ phi4 ] ) and apply it to evaluate the screening mass .    in qed",
    ", the electric screening mass describes the asymptotic behavior of the potential between two static charges at large distances .",
    "the potential is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the photon self - energy .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the potential is @xmath59 we observe that the potential at large distances is not a coulomb potential ( @xmath60 ) but a yukawa potential ( @xmath61 ) , so that it goes to zero very rapidly at distances larger that @xmath62 . that is why @xmath63 is called _ screening mass_. the asymptotic behavior of the fourier transform in  ( [ potmel-1 ] ) is determined by the singularity of the integrand closest to the origin , which in this case is a pole in the propagator @xmath64 ; therefore , the electric screening mass satisfies  @xcite : @xmath65 analogously , the screening mass @xmath66 for the @xmath67 theory is given by the location of the pole of the static ( @xmath68 ) propagator : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the self - energy of @xmath16 .",
    "the effective lagrangian has to be compatible with the symmetries of the original theory ; _",
    "i.e. _ , it has to be symmetric under the exchange @xmath71 . then , the most general lagrangian is of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are coupling constants of the effective theory .",
    "@xmath76 represents an infinite series of nonrenormalizable terms , each of them with a corresponding effective coupling constant . at leading order",

    "similarly , the non - renormalizable terms included in @xmath82 can also be neglected .",
    "what remains is a super - renormalizable effective theory .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath74 is computed by matching the full theory and the effective theory .",

    "this integration contributes to @xmath74 starting at next - to - leading - order and generates the contributions to the other parameters of the effective lagrangian  ( [ eff4 ] ) such as @xmath73 , @xmath75 , etc .",
    "the actual evaluation of the effective parameters is , in general , performed by matching the full and effective theories in the region where they describe the same physics .",
    "this region corresponds to large distances @xmath92 ; therefore , we have to match physical quantities whose feynman diagrams have a typical external momentum much smaller than @xmath10 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath73 is determined by matching the electric screening mass @xmath66 . in the effective theory ,",
    "the screening mass is defined by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the self - energy of @xmath96 .",
    "we could compute @xmath66 in both the full theory and the effective theory and then match them to determine @xmath73 . in the full theory we would have to resum infinite series of diagrams such as those described at the beginning of sect .",
    "[ ftft ] .",
    "there is an alternative method that greatly reduces the effort required to determine the parameters in the effective theory .",
    "it involves introducing an infrared cutoff @xmath97 satisfying @xmath98 on the internal momenta @xmath99 of diagrams contributing to the physical quantity that we want to compute . in the full theory the infrared cutoff should satisfy @xmath98 and in the effective theory @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective theory . in the full theory with an infrared cutoff @xmath102 , there are no complications from infrared divergences since @xmath103 .",
    "we can therefore avoid resummations and compute using the _ strict perturbation expansion _ in powers of @xmath41 . in the effective theory , with an infrared cutoff @xmath102",
    ", calculations can also be simplified .",
    "since the leading order contribution to @xmath73 is of order @xmath104 and @xmath103 , we can treat @xmath73 as a perturbation and take the propagator of @xmath96 to be simply @xmath105 . in",
    "what follows i will refer to the resulting perturbative expansion as the _ strict perturbation expansion _ of the effective theory . by construction ,",
    "our effective theory is equivalent to the full theory at low momentum .",
    "therefore , the infrared cutoff modifies the full theory and the effective theory in precisely the same way .",
    "we can therefore match the strict perturbation expansions of the full and effective theories to extract the effective parameters .",
    "note that we use the strict perturbation expansion only as a device to determine the effective parameters . to actually calculate physical quantities",
    "we must remove the infrared cutoff . in the effective theory , this will require using @xmath106 as the propagator of the field @xmath96 instead of @xmath105 .    although we have used a momentum cutoff for illustration , we can determine the effective parameters by matching the strict perturbation expansions of the full and effective theories with any infrared regulator .",
    "as we will see , a particularly convenient choice for the infrared cutoff is dimensional regularization .",
    "while this method does not explicitly cut off the low momentum region from internal loops , it still allows the consistent calculation of a strict perturbation expansion for both the full theory and the effective theory .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the mass parameter @xmath73 in the effective lagrangian  ( [ eff4 ] ) for the @xmath67 theory by matching calculations of the screening mass defined by  ( [ smass ] ) in the full theory and by  ( [ emass ] ) in the effective theory .",

    "these methods have been used to unravel the contributions to the free energy of qcd at high temperature from the scales @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and @xmath266 .",
    "also , the free energy has been explicitly computed to order @xmath1 and the calculation of the @xmath2 contribution outlined .",
    "the calculation was significantly streamlined by using effective - field - theory methods to reduce every step of the calculation to one that involves only a single momentum scale .",
    "our explicit calculations allow us to study the convergence of the perturbation expansion for thermal qcd .",
    "they suggest that perturbation theory at the scale @xmath13 requires a much smaller value of the coupling constant than perturbation theory at the scale @xmath10 . at the scale @xmath10 ,",
    "perturbative corrections are small for all temperatures @xmath290 mev . of course , even if this condition is satisfied , the perturbation expansion may break down anyway , but this is certainly a necessary condition . at the scale @xmath13 , perturbative corrections can be small only if @xmath291 gev .",
    "thus , in order to achieve a given relative accuracy , the temperature @xmath10 must be an order of magnitude larger for perturbation theory at the scale @xmath13 compared to perturbation theory at the scale @xmath10 .",
    "there is a range of temperatures in which perturbation theory at the scale @xmath13 has broken down , but perturbation theory at the scale @xmath10 is reasonably accurate . in this case , one can still use perturbation theory at the scale @xmath10 to calculate the parameters in the eqcd lagrangian .",
    "however , nonperturbative methods , such as lattice simulations of eqcd , are required to calculate the effects of the smaller momentum scales @xmath13 and @xmath266 .",
    "while one could simply treat the entire problem nonperturbatively using lattice simulations of full qcd , the effective - field - theory approach provides a dramatic savings in resources for numerical computation .",
    "the savings come from two sources .",
    "one is the reduction of the problem from a 4-dimensional field theory to a 3-dimensional field theory .",
    "the other source of savings is that quarks are integrated out of the theory , which reduces it to a purely bosonic problem .",

    "i would like to thank e.  braaten for many valuable discussions and reading the manuscript carefully .",
