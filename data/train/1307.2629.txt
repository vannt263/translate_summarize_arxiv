    "approximately two thirds of the available observing time with the parkes radio telescope is currently dedicated to searching for and studying pulsars .",

    "the pulsar timing method , in which the pulse arrival times are compared with predictions for those arrival times , is used to obtain accurate measurements of each pulsar s pulse , astrometric and binary parameters .",
    "the resulting post - fit timing residuals indicate unmodelled physical effects that affect the pulsar signal . some of these , such as intrinsic instabilities in the pulsar rotation will be specific to a given pulsar .",
    "if the post - fit timing residuals for all pulsars are identical then the cause must be an earth - based phenomenon .",

    "will induce timing residuals dependent upon the angle between the pulsar , earth and gravitational - wave source .",
    "therefore by identifying the angular distribution of the correlations it is possible to disentangle many of these phenomena .",
    "this leads to the concept of a pulsar timing array ( see , e.g. , foster & backer 1990 ) in which a large number of millisecond pulsars are observed , their post - fit timing residuals determined and a search is made for correlated timing residuals .    since the year 2005",

    "[ fg : burst ] we show the resulting @xmath23 and @xmath24 time series ( data points with errors ) that clearly recover the simulated burst ( solid lines ) . the resulting fit is not perfect as it is impossible to measure the linear or quadratic component of a burst event that lasts longer than the data span .",
    "this is because the pulsars intrinsic pulse periods and time derivatives are unknown .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 time series are therefore constrained within the fit not to include a quadratic polynomial .",
    "the method described above can be used to search for individual sources of gravitational waves . however , this method is not suitable for a gravitational wave background .",
    "we are therefore improving the algorithm described by yardley et al .",
    "our algorithm is still being developed , but is based on forming cross - power spectra for each pair of pulsars using the cholesky method for dealing with steep , red noise ( coles et al .",
    "these cross - power spectra are used to form the covariance between two data sets .",
    "the correlations between pairs of pulsars as a function of the angle between the pulsars are expected to follow the prediction of hellings & downs ( 1983 ) .",
    "our algorithm is still work - in - progress , but we have successfully applied our method to the international pulsar timing array data challenge .      .",
    "the right - hand panel displays the offset in the observatory - ssb position in x , y and z as a function of time.,width=226 ]    champion et al .",
    "( 2010 ) searched for the signatures of incorrect mass estimates of the planetary systems in our solar system .",
    "this method relies on knowledge of the relative positions as a function of time of the planetary system , the earth and the solar system barycentre ( ssb ) .",
    "this method is therefore not applicable to searching for unknown masses in the solar system . we have therefore updated the tempo2 software to measure offsets in the estimate of the earth s position with respect to the ssb using a pta data set .",
    "the initial estimate of the earth s position with respect to the ssb is obtained from a planetary ephemeris .",
    "any error , or omission , in that ephemeris will therefore lead to an incorrect estimate of the earth - ssb vector .",
    "inspection of time series of the error in the three components of the earth - ssb vector allows unknown masses to be identified . as an example",
    "we simulate data sets that include an error in the mass of the jovian system of @xmath25 .",
    "this mass error could easily be measured using the champion et al .",
    "( 2010 ) approach , but here we make no assumption about the nature of the error in the planetary ephemeris .",
    "we assume that five pulsars have been observed since 1990 .",
    "the output of the tempo2 global fit provides the offset of the earth - ssb vector from the planetary ephemeris prediction ( figure  [ fg : dxdydz ] ) .",
    "these offsets could subsequently be searched to identify the orbital period of the unknown mass and the orbital angle with respect to the ecliptic plane , thereby determining the position and orbit of the unknown objects .",
    "this procedure can be generalised and used to determine the position of any telescope at any position in the solar system .",
    "we have recently used ppta data to show how this method can be used to navigate a space craft through the solar system ( deng et al . submitted ) .      in hobbs",
    "2012b ) we describe new updates to tempo2 that allow the signal common to all pulsars to be identified given a pta data set .",
    "this method was applied to the ppta data sets and we recovered the known offsets between the world s best time standards : international atomic time and terrestrial time as realised by the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm ) .",
    "one major issue with our method is that we assume that the noise in the data sets has the same statistical form throughout the observations .",
    "however , as described in manchester et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we are unable to correct our earliest data sets for dispersion measure variations .",
    "the timing residuals for most pulsars are therefore affected , for the earliest observations , by dispersion measure variations and , for the most recent observations , by other noise processes such as intrinsic pulsar timing noise .",
    "we are currently enhancing the coles et al .",
    "( 2011 ) cholesky routines to account for non - stationary noise processes and will use the new routines to improve our pulsar - based time standard .",
    "some of the ppta observations are carried out by high school students as part of the pulse@parkes education program ( hobbs et al .",
    "this program provides high school students with two hours of observing per month .",
    "so far more than 1000 students from australia , japan , the usa , the netherlands , england and wales have been part of the program .",
    "the parkes pulsar timing array is continuing to obtain high quality pulsar timing observations of @xmath1 20 millisecond pulsars .",
    "these data sets are leading to exciting new research on topics as diverse as studying the solar wind to searching for bursts of gravitational waves to navigating space craft through the solar system .",
    "the data sets are also being combined with observations from europe and north america to form the international pulsar timing array data sets . with further development to the hardware systems at parkes",
    "it is likely that these observations will continue to contribute to timing array data sets into the square kilometre array era .",
