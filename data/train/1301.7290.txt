    "unusual new phenomena in the heat trace asymptotics in the setup of singular spaces have attracted a considerable interest since the explicit observations by falomir , muschietti , pisani and seeley in @xcite as well as by kirsten , loya and park in @xcite , @xcite for certain explicit regular - singular operators on a line segment .",
