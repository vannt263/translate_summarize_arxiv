    "this equation may model a passive vector field @xmath12 , like a magnetic field , in a turbulent fluid with a non - trivial average component @xmath2 .",
    "the intensity @xmath7 of the noise can be arbitrarily small , in the sequel , to model real situations when the noise ( which always exists ) is usually neglected in first approximation",
    ". however , the trajectories of @xmath13  are only hlder continuous with exponent smaller than @xmath14 and not differentiable at any point , so that the impulses given by the term @xmath15 are small when cumulated in time ( @xmath16 ) but istantaneously very strong .",
    "we aim at studying existence , uniqueness , representation formula and regularity under low regularity assumption on @xmath2 .",
    "the key point of this work is the fact that the noise prevents blow - up , under assumptions on @xmath2 such that blow - up may occur in the deterministic case .",
    "when @xmath17 , we give an example of hlder continuous vector field @xmath2 such that infinite values of @xmath12 arise in finite time from a bounded continuous initial field @xmath18 ;  then we prove that hlder continuity and boundedness of @xmath19 is sufficient , in the stochastic case ( @xmath20 ) , to prove that continuous initial field @xmath9 produces continuous fields @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "the singularity in the deterministic case is associated to infinite stretching of @xmath23;randomness prevents stretching to blow - up to infinity .",

    "clearly , linear vector advection equation is a very idealized model of fluid dynamics but this result opens the question whether noise may prevent blow - up of the vorticity field of 3d euler equations .",
    "the emergence of singularity seems to require a certain degree of organization of the fluid structures and perhaps this organization is lost , broken , under the influence of randomness . with further degree of speculation",
    ", one could even think that a turbulent regime may contain the necessary degree of randomness to prevent blow - up ; if so , singularities of the vorticity could more likely be associated to strong transient phases , instead of established turbulent ones .    from the mathematical side , this is not the first result of this nature , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for uniqueness of weak solutions due to noise ( the other face of the celebrated open problem presented by @xcite ) . however",
    ", these papers deal with scalar problems , like linear transport equations , linear continuity equations , vorticity in 2d euler equations , 1d vlasov - poisson equations .",
    "the result of the present paper is the first one dealing with vector valued pdes like 3d euler equations ;  the kind of singularity in the vectorial case is different , related to rotations and stretching instead of shocks or mass concentration .",
    "several new technical difficulties arise due to the vectorial nature of the equation ( for instance , the proof of uniqueness of non - regular solutions , lemma [ lemma uniqueness ] , usually involving commutator estimates , here is more difficult and is obtained by special cancellations , also inspired to @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention also the improvement of well - posedness due to noise proved for dispersive equations , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in all the works mentioned so far the noise is multiplicative , and often of transport type like in the present paper . the role of additive noise in preventing singularities is more obscure . for uniqueness under poor drift ,",
    "additive noise is very powerful see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; however , its relevance in fluid dynamics is still under investigation .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , flcime , @xcite for partial results .    for additional details on vector advection equations",
    "see for instance brznekl and references therein . for advanced results on the differentiability of stochastic flow generated by rough drift ( key ingredient of the representation formula ( [ reprform ] ) ) ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for a general reference on passive advection driven by random velocity fields",
    "see @xcite , where also the case of a passive magnetic field is discussed ; the structure of the noise term in the present work is very simplified with respect to @xcite but the point here is to prove that noise has a depleting effect on @xmath23 and this fact is true also under this simple noise ; generalization to space - homogeneous noise with more complex space structure is possible , if @xmath31 , the covariance matrix at @xmath32 , is non - degenerate .",
    "the model described here is clearly too idealized for a direct interest in fluid dynamics but once the phenomenon of depletion of stretching is rigorously proved in this particular framework , there is more motivation to investigate generalizations which could become closer to reality .",
    "one of them would be the case when @xmath2 contains ( also just small ) high frequency fluctuations , although not being white noise .",

    "the idea of the example of blow - up comes from identity ( [ reprform ] ) : one has to construct a flow @xmath74 , corresponding to a vector field @xmath2 less regular than @xmath79 ; c_{b}^{1}(\\mathbb{r}^{3};\\mathbb{r}^{3})\\right ) $ ] , such that @xmath80 blows - up at some point .",
    "limited to this and next subsection , we denote points of @xmath0 by @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 ( and analogous notations for euclidea coordinates ) .",
    "let us recall that the material derivative , in cylindrical coordinates , for vectors @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) are given by the formula @xmath89consequently , @xmath90    with these preliminaries , let us consider a vector field @xmath2 of the form @xmath91and assume that @xmath92 is a vector field of class @xmath93 on @xmath94 which satisfies ( on @xmath94 ) the equation @xmath95with divergence - free initial condition @xmath9 .",
    "notice that @xmath96@xmath2@xmath97@xmath23@xmath98 . indeed , @xmath2 is divergence free vector field by definition and @xmath99 .",

    "with more work , taking a time - dependent vector field @xmath2  which is smooth until time @xmath129 when it develops an hlder singularity of the form above , one can construct an example of solution @xmath23  which is smooth on @xmath130 but infinite at some point at time @xmath131 .",
    "such example would mimic more closely what maybe could happen in a non - passive version of the vector advection equation .",

    "figure 1 shows a number of lagrangian trajectories ( solutions of the cauchy problem ( [ ode ] ) )  starting on the @xmath82-axis , in the regular case @xmath135 , where the velocity produces a rigid motion ( no singularity ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the case @xmath136 , where the velocity of rotation near the origin is so large ( still infinitesimal , so that the velocity field is hlder continuous ) that very close initial particles are displaced a lot ;  and the ratio between the displacement at time @xmath137 and that at time zero diverges when the particles approach zero .    2   + fig.1 .",

    "\\ii ) the flow @xmath74 is however not differentiable at the vertical axis @xmath133 ( it is smooth outside @xmath133 ) , as it may be guesses from figure 2 ; ideal lines of lagrangian points in a plane orthogonal to @xmath133 are stretched near @xmath133 and the stretching becomes infinite at @xmath133 , see figure 3 below .",
    "\\iii ) the passive field @xmath23  is also stretched by the fluid and the stretching blows - up at @xmath133 .    with this picture in mind , we may anticipate the behavior when we add noise . as we shall see below , the transport type noise , in stratonovich form , introduced in equation ( [ vectadv ] ) ,",
    "corresponds at the lagrangian level to the addition of a random shift to all lagrangian particles ( see equation ( [ sde ] ) ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 below show the time evolution of the ideal line initially equal to the @xmath82 axis . in the deterministic case ( figure 3 ) this line is infinitely stretched near the origin . in the stochastic case ( figure 4 ) , even with very small noise intensity ( @xmath140 , the line is shifted by noise a little bit in all possible directions and thus it passes through the origin only for a negligible amount of time .",
    "stretching still occurs but not with infinite strength and the visible result is that the line at the forth time instant looks still smooth although strongly curved .    stretching still exists but it is smeared - out , distributed among different portions of fluid ; the deterministic concentration of stretching at @xmath133 is broken .    2   + fig.3 .",
