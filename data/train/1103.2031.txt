    "ii  cma , which was first discovered as a byproduct by mazur et al .",
    "( 1993 ) when they searched for variable stars in the intermediate age open cluster berkeley  33 , is a w  uma - type contact binary in the field of the cluster ( berkeley  33 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , either named as ruprecht  7 ) .",
    "they marked it as @xmath4 , and classified it into ew - type .",
    "it was named as ii  cma by the latest version of the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs for short , samus et al .",
    "it is very clear to see a oconnell effect ( oconnell , 1951 ) in mazur et al.s v , i lights .",
    "the amplitude in v & i magnitude were both 0.5 mag according to mazur et al .",
    "they also gave its period as 0.2292 days , ( v - i ) as 1.44 , ( b - v ) as 1.3 .",
    "they concluded that ii  cma is probably a foreground contact binary , of later type , similar to the well - studied system cc  com and v523  cas .",
    "the other research about it came from rucinski ( 1998 ) . having used @xmath5 , @xmath6 , rucinski ( 1998 ) pointed out the contact binary star ii  cma is definitely not members of the cluster be  33 .",
    "after observed on two nights ( february 19 , 21 , 2007 ) with the pi1024 tkb ccd photometric system attached to the 1.0-m reflecting telescope at the yunnan observatory in china , the data in r band of ii  cma were obtained .",
    "the r color systems used are close to the standard ubvri system and the effective field of view of the photometric system is @xmath7 arc min at the telescope s cassegrain focus .",
    "the integration time for each image is 150s .",
    "phot ( measure magnitudes for a list of stars ) of the aperture photometry package of iraf was used to reduce the observed images .",
    "the observations in the r passband completely cover the orbital phase .",
    "we calculated the phase of the observations with the linear ephemeris ( eq.1 ) given in next section , and plotted the r light in figure 1 .",
    "our original data in the r band are listed in table 1 .",
    "the light curve is continuous and possesses a very small difference between the depths of minima which reveal the system was tidally distorted and both components temperature may be similar .",
    "the maximum brightness is 15.22mag in v passband and the amplitude of the light variation is @xmath8mag . since the two minima in the curve show a sharp variation , those properties suggest that the system has a low orbital inclination and the size of the two components might be similar",
    ". we also plotted the comparison and the check star s corresponding curve in figure 1 .",
    "it is a straight line showing that the comparison star is constant and the variation of the curve upon plate in figure 1 truly came from ii  cma .",
    "corresponding coordinates of the binary , comparison and check star are listed in table 2 .",
    "we chose the comparison star as close to the variable as it can where the range of air - mass difference between both stars was very small ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , extinction correction was not made .",
    "it is shown in this figure that the data are high quality except for several data points and the light variation is typical of ew - type . due to the light minimum is symmetric , a parabolic fitting was adopted to determine the times of minimum light with a least square method .",
    "two epochs of light minimum were obtained in all and are listed in the last two rows of table 3 .",
    "there are some obvious variations in the light curves , such as oconnell effect , eclipse depth at minimum .",
    "it is very clear to see a oconnell effect ( oconnell , 1951 ) in mazur et al.s v , i lights .",
    "namely the magnitude of 0.75 phase is about 0.022 mag bright than that of the 0.25 phase in i light . in v light ,",
    "the oconnell effect is the same as i light , but the value is slightly smaller than 0.022 mag , it is about 0.02 mag .",
    "we can call that as negative oconnell effect .",
    "however , it disappeared now .",
    "another variation in the light curve is that the amplitude in v magnitude was 0.5 mag according to mazur et al .",
    "1993 , while that in r is 0.45 mag now .",
    "although observed in different passband , noting that wavelength of r band is between that of v band and i band , we have sufficient reasons to believe the light curve changes . on the other hand , this kind of changes",
    "are frequently seen in w  uma - type binaries .",
    "for instance , fg  hya ( qian & yang , 2005 ) , ah  cnc ( qian et al . 2006 ) , eq  tau ( yang & liu , 2004 ) , cu  tau ( qian et al . 2005 ) , ad  cnc ( yang & liu , 2002a ) , qx  and ( qian et al .",

    "ii cma would not be a member of be33 for two reasons .",
    "firstly , according rucinski s ( 1998 ) result , @xmath10 , its distance modular is 9.32 , which indicates this system is in front of the cluster in space .",
    "secondly , assumed it is a cluster member , noticing that the binary ii  cma appears at the red giant branch in the cluster s color - magnitude diagram , it should be a red giant system . but based on the theory of structure and evolution of stars , it hardly to explain how such system who possesses a typical ew - type light curve be born .",
    "so , we prefer that ii cma is a front field star .",
    "it is remarkable that ii cma and the cluster have same interstellar extinction ( see previous sections ) , which may imply there is a big extinction matter in front of them .    colligating the reasons above",
    ", we can say that the w  uma - type high mass ratio shallow contact binary in the intermediate - aged open cluster berkeley  33 field ii  cma is a very interesting object to be study .",
    "it will be helpful to understand something about marginal contact binaries .",
    "eventually , since the eclipse binary is partial and absolute physical dimensions are still uncertain yet , it can not take the purely light solution as a definition .",
    "it is just a reasonable result . only will precision radial - velocity curves put our result on a strong footing . in the future",
    ", for identify its identity strictly , a precise spectra observation is needed , which may help us to make sure weather it a member or not . speaking for itself , this would be the most important element we need to know , otherwise all the works purely stood on a assumption . and",
    "another thing , we should accumulate the times of its minimum in order to investigate its orbital period changes , which can open out its evolution stage . in a word , it is essential to monitor the every interesting high mass ratio low contact factor contact binary system ii  cma .    0.3 in acknowledgments :",
