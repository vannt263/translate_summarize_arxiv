    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) emit intense x - ray radiation by converting the gravitational energy of matter accreted onto the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . according to the so - called agn unified model @xcite , the central engine is obscured by a dusty torus , which affects the observed x - ray spectrum via photoelectric absorption and compton reflection . in addition , a relativistically blurred reflection component from the innermost accretion disk",
    "would be expected when the disk is extended down to a vicinity of the smbh .",
    "hence , observations of broadband x - ray spectra of agns are useful to investigate their structure including the torus and accretion disk .",
    "low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , which we define by their low x - ray luminosities in the 14195 kev band ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath2 ) , are important objects to understand the evolution of agns .",
    "llagns contain two extreme types of agns : those with a small smbh mass and a high mass - accretion rate ( i.e. , with a high eddington ratio ) , and those with a large smbh mass and a low mass - accretion rate ( a low eddington ratio ) .",
    "the former type is expected in the early growing phase of a smbh , whereas the latter corresponds to the fading phase of an agn into a quiescent smbh .",
    "broadband x - ray studies of llagns have been limited , however , because of their low fluxes even in the local universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "theories and observations suggest that llagns are not a simple scaled - down version of luminous agns in terms of their nucleus structure .",
    "when the accretion rate falls below a critical level , it is predicted that the state of the inner accretion disk changes from the standard accretion disk @xcite to an optically - thin radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "studies of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the radio to x - ray bands showed that the standard disk is truncated at a radius much larger than a few schwarzschild radii ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by the lack of the big blue bump in llagns , which arises from the thermal emission from the inner standard disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , most of llagns do not show a broad iron - k@xmath5 line feature , suggesting that the standard disk does not extend to the inner most region around the smbh , except for some llagns ( e.g. , ngc 4051 ; @xcite ) .",
    "also , @xcite found a negative correlation between the x - ray photon index and eddington ratio for low eddington ratio agns ( @xmath11 ) , whereas the positive one for luminous agns was reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the negative correlation can be explained with a riaf model .",
    "for the detailed investigations of the broad iron line feature and continuum components , broadband x - ray spectra are highly important .",
    "x - ray surveys showed that the absorbed agn fraction , which reflects the torus covering factor , decreases with x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite , 2014 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results would be consistent with receding torus models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the inner wall of the torus recedes with luminosity by keeping its scale - height more constant .",
    "however , recent surveys have found evidence that the absorbed agn fraction decreases towards lower x - ray luminosities from a peak around @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these facts suggest that , at low luminosities , other physical mechanisms than agn radiation must be responsible to determine the torus structure .",
    "main goals of this paper are ( 1 ) to best constrain the x - ray spectral properties of llagns by taking advantage of their `` broadband '' ( 0.5200 kev ) data observed with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat , ( 2 ) to reveal the nuclear structure including the torus and accretion disk , and ( 3 ) to find key parameters that determine them .",
    "most of previous studies are limited to soft energy bands below @xmath1310 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from the _ swift_/bat 70-month catalog @xcite , we select all ten llagns ( @xmath14 in the 14195 kev band ) whose _ suzaku _ archival data are public .",
    "we exclude ngc  4051 , which is known to exhibit large spectral variation among different epochs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "a similar result was also obtained by @xcite . as suggested by some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",

    "a hot corona located above the disk produces comptonized emission of seed photons provided from the disk .",

    "suzaku _ , they found that the @xmath350  ratio decreases with luminosity in both type-1 and type-2 agns at @xmath351 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "these results can be explained if the torus covering fraction becomes smaller at higher luminosities , and are consistent with the anti - correlation between the absorbed - agn fraction and luminosity in this luminosity range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we plot @xmath350  against luminosity of our llagn sample together with the original sample of @xcite in figure  [ fig : line_vs_lum ] .",
    "here we exclude compton - thick agns ( @xmath352 @xmath47 ) because the heavy obscuration also strongly affects the iron - k@xmath5 line flux and the relation may become complex ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the dashed lines in the figure are the best - fit linear regression forms for type-1 and type-2 agns obtained by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : line_vs_lum ] shows a trend that the @xmath350  ratio has a peak around @xmath353 erg s@xmath2 , from which the average value rapidly declines towards lower luminosities .",
    "this agrees with the implication from hard x - ray ( @xmath0 kev ) surveys that the absorbed agn fraction peaks at @xmath354 erg s@xmath2 and decreases with decreasing luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our study using the narrow iron - k@xmath5 line supports the picture that the averaged solid angle of agn tori is not a monotonically decreasing function with luminosity , and that irradiation is not the only key factor that determines the torus structure .",
    "we note that there is a large scatter of @xmath350  in the llagns , as discussed in the previous subsection .      figure  [ fig : ew_vs_edd - rat ] shows the eddington ratio dependence of @xmath350  based on our llagn sample .",

    "we thus infer that the eddington ratio is a key parameter that affects the torus structure of llagns : tori are hardly developed below a critical value of @xmath8 . because the sample size is limited , however , we would need a larger number of llagns to draw a robust conclusion .",
    "the lack of the torus may lead to the shortage of mass supply through it , hence reducing the mass - accretion rate . in an opposite way",

    "thus , to understand the reason of the @xmath350  versus @xmath8 correlation , we need to reveal the physical origin(s ) of agn tori .",

    "such correlation is expected because the dust torus heated by an agn emits blackbody radiation in the mir band .",

    "the regression line derived by @xcite from a large local agn sample is plotted by the solid line .",
    "@xcite took only the nuclear mir emission by separating from that in the host galaxy , using subarcsecond resolution imaging data .",
    "we refer to the photometric data in the 12 @xmath357 m band of @xcite for our objects whenever available , and to the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) catalog @xcite for the rest . due to the poor angular resolution of _",
    "wise _ ( 6.5 arcsec ) , however , its flux may be contaminated from that of the host galaxy and hence should be regarded as an upper limit of the nuclear emission .",
    "we find that our llagns also approximately follow the same correlation as found by @xcite for higher luminosity agns , regardless of agn types and eddington ratios .",
    "this is expected if a ( moderate size of ) torus is present in llagns .",
    "there is a possibility that synchrotron emission from the jets or blackbody radiation from the truncated disk may contribute to the mir luminosity in some llagns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our result in section  [ sec : lumedd2iron ] suggests that the low eddington ratio llagns ( @xmath355 ) do not have developed tori . in these objects ,",

    "the spectral index in the mir band of luminous agns are typically @xmath361 in the form of @xmath362 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "to model the spectrum of the ulx in ngc 5643 , we use the _ xmm - newton _ data ( obsid = 0601420101 ) obtained in 2009 , because the exposure ( @xmath365 ksec ) is longer than that of the other _ xmm - newton _ observation ( @xmath366 ksec ) in 2003 .",
    "the standard analysis software ( version 13.5.0 ) is utilized to reduce the data of the epic cameras ( mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn ) .",
    "for all cameras , the source events are extracted from a circular region of a 26  radius , and the background events are taken from a source - free circular region with the same radius .",
    "the spectra of mos-1 and mos-2 are summed .",
    "we find that a cut - off power law plus a disk - blackbody component well reproduces the spectra in the 0.37 kev band ( @xmath57 = 183.4/154 ) . here",
    "the cut - off energy is fixed at 6 kev , a value observed from a typical ulx , ngc  1313 x-1 @xcite ; the fit is not significantly improved by leaving the cut - off energy as a free parameter ( @xmath57 = 182.4/153 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are a photon index of @xmath367 , a disk - blackbody normalization of 3.7 @xmath368 erg s@xmath2 kpc@xmath369 , and a disk temperature of 0.35 kev .",
    "when we analyze the _ suzaku _ spectra of ngc  5643 , we always include this best - fit ulx model ."
