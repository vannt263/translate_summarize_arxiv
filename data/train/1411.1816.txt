    "<S> @xcite , it was found for the @xmath79 case that valleys ( local minima ) of the velocity potential @xmath9 move continuously and eventually coalesce . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when @xmath79 , independent particles with slightly different initial conditions cluster in a specific valley , which leads to @xmath53 concentrated on @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our model with @xmath81 , a particle can escape from one valley of @xmath9 to another valley due to thermal noise @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently explain that this activation effect is too weak to remove the concentration of @xmath53 on a finite overlap . </S>",
    "<S> first , it has been known that the steady - state distribution of the kpz equation is equivalent to the probability distribution of a random potential field in the continuous version of the sinai model @xcite , where ultraslow diffusion @xmath82 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> now , let us suppose that we observe the distance of two independent particles with different thermal noises during a time interval @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance would be @xmath83 for large @xmath32 if the potential were frozen . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , particles whose distance from each other is within a length scale @xmath84 cluster in one valley by coalescences of valleys , where @xmath84 is expected to be @xmath85 with some @xmath86 for large @xmath32 because it is determined by the diffusive nature of motion of the valleys . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from @xmath87 for large @xmath32 , we conclude that the phenomenon observed in the system with @xmath79 is robust to thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the coalescence of valleys can be understood from the absence of rsb for the case where particles are driven by a field obeying the edwards  wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xcite , because the steady - state probability distribution of the potential field for the ew equation is the same as that for the kpz equation while the valleys of the potential do not coalesce .    _ </S>",
    "<S> concluding remarks. _ we discuss previous studies related to our results . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known that two independent and identical dynamical systems exhibit mutual attraction of trajectories with slightly different initial conditions when they are subject to a common noise . </S>",
    "<S> examples include synchronization of two independent oscillators driven by a common noise @xcite , and aggregation of independent particles driven by a common gaussian random velocity field @xcite or a common spatio - temporal chaotic field @xcite . a more recent work on diffusive fluctuating hydrodynamics reports a similar phenomenon through the analysis of the dynamical free energy of the lyapunov exponent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are similar to that studied in our paper in that attraction of trajectories in two independent and identical systems is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> one can interpret that a common disordered velocity field in our study corresponds to a common noise in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> although this interpretation is reasonable , the two systems in our study are subject to independent thermal noises in addition to a common velocity field , which makes a contrast to previous studies </S>",
    "<S> . we also remark that mutual attraction of trajectories in two independent systems was observed in our system without thermal noise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that to find the common - noise - induced attraction robust against independent noises is a highly non - trivial problem , which corresponds to the discovery of a phase transition at finite temperature for a symmetry breaking at @xmath88 in equilibrium statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the main achievement of our study is that we solve this problem by using the concept of rsb .    in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated rsb in trajectories for a tracer particle passively driven by a field obeying the noisy burgers equation . in this model , two tracer particles driven by a common velocity field </S>",
    "<S> are always close to each other when they freeze to the same trajectory , while they become separated from each other with time when each particle freezes to a different trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> these two cases correspond to two peaks in @xmath53 at @xmath89 and @xmath54 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such a pathological transportation property is detected only by the observation of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the dynamical free energy of overlap will be a useful tool to characterize a singularity of trajectories for a wide class of phenomena including chemical networks @xcite and cell differentiation @xcite .    </S>",
