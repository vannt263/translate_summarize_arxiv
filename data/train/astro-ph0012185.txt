    "every survey has its biases , whether imposed by its flux limits or selection techniques - despite the best efforts of the scientists involved",
    ". proper analysis of the results of any survey requires one to understand the impact of these biases on both the range of parameter space to which the survey is sensitive , and also on the broader scheme , including properties which do not form part of the survey definition , but which nevertheless represent characteristics of the class and/or important diagnostics .",
    "historically , our knowledge of blazar properties began with radio surveys , which tend to be dominated by radio - bright objects . as we discovered in the 1980s ,",
    "such objects are the most luminous of all agn , as well as violently variable and radio core dominated .",
    "indications that these properties were not typical of all blazars did not come until the publication of the first large x - ray survey , the _ einstein _ emss ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) . the emss bl lacs are considerably less luminous , less variable , less polarized , and less core dominated than their radio - selected cousins ( perlman & stocke 1993 ; jannuzi , elston & smith 1994 ; kollgaard et al . 1996 ; giommi et al . 1995 ; rector et al . 2000 ) .",
    "they also have synchrotron peaks in the uv / x - ray rather than ir / optical ( giommi et al .",
    "1995 , sambruna et al .",
    "1996 , fossati et al .",
    "various explanations for these differences have been proposed ( see the review by urry & padovani 1995 , and also ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 and georganopoulos & marscher 1998 ) .",
    "but it was not until the mid-1990s that opinions began to come full circle .",
    "even if one assumes an unbiased identification process ( not always the case , see e.g. , marcha & browne 1993 , 1996 ; perlman et al .",
    "1996 ; rector et al .",
    "1999 ) each survey s flux limits affect its sensitivity to parameter space . in his paper ,",
    "paolo padovani presented two figures ( padovani 2000 , figures 1 and 2 ) which illustrate the sensitivity of various surveys to x - ray / radio parameter space , using their flux limits . for completeness and for the sake of minimum bias ,",
    "one wants surveys that are : ( 1 ) as close as possible to the diagonal lines defined by the inverse - compton and synchrotron peak limits - which are also the extrema for known hbls and lbls respectively ; and ( 2 ) large enough that all spectral shape classes are represented in statistically significant numbers .",
    "yet even with surveys meeting these requirements , some biases remain , since each flux limit imposes diagonal `` completeness contours '' on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "thus even a survey which is near an extreme line in the @xmath1 plane does not have uniform sensitivity to all regions of @xmath0 space .",
    "nevertheless , once samples meeting these criteria are created , it will truly be possible to use their contents to simulate the overall blazar content of the universe .",
    "figure 1 illustrates these biases for the case of bl lacs . due to their small sizes and high flux limits , each of the `` classical '' surveys ( emss , 1 jy and slew ) was sensitive only to a small diagonal swath of @xmath0 parameter space . as a result",
    ", they presented an almost completely disjoint picture of bl lac properties ( it is an instructive exercise to plot the x - ray , radio and optical fluxes of the emss , 1 jy and slew bl lacs on three planes - we omit this here for lack of space ) .",
    "as this diagram shows , the new dxrbs survey fills in the gap very nicely , covering a much wider range of the @xmath0 plane much more evenly , and nicely revealing objects in the intermediate range .",
    "that intermediate range is also covered by rgb , but not as evenly because of its high optical flux limit .",
    "= 9.0 cm    as shown above , the classical surveys are are far too small and shallow to contain significant amounts of objects in all spectral shape classes .",
    "thus , even when lumped together , they present a view that is overwhelmingly colored by biases . for example , by comparing the broadband spectral shapes of the emss and 1 jy bl lacs , and the s5 fsrq , sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predicted that there should be no fsrq with @xmath2 - the historical dividing line between hbl and lbl type objects .",
    "this prediction was proven incorrect by the findings of a newer , deeper radio - limited survey , the dxrbs ( perlman et al .",
    "1998 , landt et al .",
    "2000 ) , which found that approximately 1 in 4 fsrq had @xmath2 .",
    "a subsequent cross - correlation of emission line objects in the rgb ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 ) revealed an even higher percentage of these objects ( @xmath3 , padovani et al . in prep ,",
    "perlman 2000 ) .",
    "we will talk more about these objects ( called `` hfsrq '' ) below , but first a historical comment is useful .",
    "as is well known , the slew and emss both included radio observations at 5 ghz in their identification process , but not radio spectral indices .",
    "the biases that imposed were not appreciated for several years , even though both stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and elvis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) noted the presence of radio - loud quasars in both surveys .",
    "only after the results of dxrbs began to come out was this bias considered , and corrected .",
    "cross - correlation of the slew and emss object lists with lower - frequency radio surveys reveal small , but significant samples of fsrq in both ( 22 and 16 objects respectively ; perlman et al . 1999 and in prep . ) , of which about 40% are hfsrq . by comparison ,",
    "the very high radio flux limit of the 1 jy sample makes it almost completely insensitive to these objects ( perlman et al .",
    "1998 ) . figure 2 summarizes these findings by comparing the fsrq content of the new and classical surveys .    as was the case for hbl ,",
    "hfsrq cover a different region of @xmath4 parameter space than previously known fsrq , and dominate increasingly at lower luminosities .",
    "as was pointed out by urry & padovani ( 1995 ) , the knee of the fsrq radio luminosity function sits at @xmath5 .",
    "a quick look at figure 2 is enough to convince the reader that the 1 jy survey had basically no sensitivity below that luminosity ( in fact only 2 of its objects have lower radio luminosities ) , yet it is precisely at these luminosities where the hfsrq become increasingly common .",
    "= 9.0 cm    in order to understand the full spread of blazar properties , and develop appropriate constraints upon their physics , it is imperative to investigate the properties of hfsrq in the same depth as has already been done for their bl lac cousins . to start the process ,",
    "we have observed four of the x - ray brightest hfsrq with sax to analyze their 0.1 - 10 kev spectra . in so doing , we aim to investigate the general trend noted in perlman ( 2000 ) that dxrbs hfsrq tend to have somewhat steeper rosat spectra ( as defined by their hardness ratios ) than their more radio - bright cousins . in table 1 , we give",
    "the results of these observations ( a full accounting of these results will be presented in a later paper ) .",

    "1996 ) for three of four objects .",
    "only one object ( rgbj1629 + 401 ) has a steep , hbl - like spectrum .",
    "this represents the first systematic observation of objects with demonstrably hbl - like broadband continua based upon their @xmath24 and @xmath25 values .",
    "the asca observations of `` blue '' fsrq by sambruna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) achieved an outwardy similar result , with all objects having flat hard x - ray spectra .",
    "however , the sambruna et al .",
    "result can not really be considered as an observation of hfsrq , as their selection criteria was for steep rosat spectra and not @xmath26 values indicative of a high frequency peak  and indeed , some of the sambruna et al .",
    "objects are _ not _ in the hbl region of the @xmath26 plane .    in this light , it is unclear how we should interpret the broadband spectra of hfsrq . the most straightforward interpretation would be that in all cases except for rgb j1629 + 401 we are seeing only inverse - compton emission at @xmath270.1 kev .",
    "however , extreme caution is required . at the very least these objects have two emission components ( both synchrotron and emission line ) which can serve as seeds for inverse - compton emission - and therefore it is likely that the synchrotron to inverse - compton ratio is considerably higher for hfsrq than it is for hbl bl lacs .",
    "it is of course unclear where this additional emission might evidence itself , but according to the models of sikora , begelman & rees ( 1994 ) , inverse - compton scattered emission - line photons should evidence themselves at energies of order 1 - 100 kev .",
    "thus it is very likely that for hfsrq of a given peak frequency the synchrotron to inverse - compton ratio is considerably higher than for an hbl of the same peak frequency ( see georganopoulos 2000 for an interesting discussion of exactly this point ) .",
    "thus it is still quite feasible that these objects have peak energies as high as @xmath28 kev .",
    "by contrast , for rgb j1629 + 401 the most consistent explanation of its broadband spectrum would be that we are seeing synchrotron emission all the way up to 10 kev .",
    "= 9.0 cm    it is now worthwhile to reassess the analysis of fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . figure 3 shows the @xmath29 plane for blazars when all five blazar surveys are added to the diagram .",
    "as discussed in urry & padovani ( 1995 ) , an object s @xmath30 value is related to the location of its synchrotron peak , with @xmath31 representing @xmath32 hz , and @xmath33 representing @xmath34 hz .",
    "thus , as explained by fossati et al .",
    ", the correlation between these two parameters was meant to explore the relationship between total luminosity and peak frequency . as can be seen , this correlation still persists , but when all five samples are added , it grows quite a bit broader - in fact , most of the horizontal extent in the graph is taken up by the `` outlier '' sections in the lower left and upper right hand corners .",
    "these corners represent areas where only one or two surveys had overwhelming sensitivity .",
    "if one only examines the middle section of the graph , the correlation is still very significant , but its physical meaningfulness is far less persuasive . and",
    "in fact , when _ individual _ surveys are examined no such correlation is present ! this is shown convincingly by figure 4 , which is the same plot with only dxrbs objects shown .",
    "it is therefore impossible to tell whether the @xmath29 plot represents a physically important correlation , or is merely reflective of the parameter space sensitivity of each survey .",
    "the comparison of figures 3 and 4 illustrate quite well the dangers inherent in combining surveys with very different biases and sensitivities , and attempting to derive correlations .",
    "these biases will continue to color our perception of blazar properties until either radio and x - ray selected samples become large and deep enough to include significant numbers of objects in every spectral shape class .",
    "dxrbs is the first radio - limited survey to accomplish this , but it will take much deeper radio and optical surveys to accomplish this for an x - ray flux limited sample , even with rosat data ( see padovani 2000 ) . thus to fully understand the findings of surveys",
    "whose parameter space coverage lies in the middle of the padovani diagrams ( e.g. , rex , rgb ) , significant modeling will be required .",
    "fossati ( 2000 ) has described a promising avenue for such modeling efforts .",
    "however , it is instructive to note that the error bars on his models are still quite large , probably because of the almost disjoint parameter space coverage of the emss , slew and 1 jy surveys . once fossati has included deeper surveys such as dxrbs in his seed samples , it will be interesting to see whether the resulting error bars are sufficiently small that the technique can be used to predict the outcomes of future blazar surveys .",
    "a similar comment applies to the modelling efforts of georganopoulos & marscher .",
