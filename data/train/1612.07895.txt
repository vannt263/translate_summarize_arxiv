    "the corotating interaction region ( cir ) and icme are main drivers of forbush decrease .",
    "the cir generates recurrent , symmetric and weak forbush decrease , whereas icme induced forbush decrease is non - recurrent , highly asymmetric and strong in nature .",

    "the past studies of forbush decrease show either one - step or two - step cosmic ray decrease profile during icme transit @xcite .",
    "the two - step traditional model and observational studies of forbush decrease profile manifest that the first step and the second steps are caused by different icme sub - structures i.e. shock sheath and mc respectively ( for example @xcite ) .",

    "( 1998 ) has put forward the shock - barrier model to understand contribution of the shock - sheath in forbush decrease .",
    "this model considers the diffusion of cosmic rays across the propagating diffusive barrier .",
    "therefore depression of cosmic ray flux is observed during shock - sheath transit across the earth @xcite .",
    "the one - step / gradual decrease in cosmic ray flux is expected during complete transit of shock - sheath region according to this model .",
    "however , observations demonstrate that one - step ( corresponding to small part of shock - sheath ) or multi - step decreases with respective recovery during its transit , which can not be explain by this model .",
    "interestingly , jordan et al.(2011 ) has studied 233 icme events which could have produced two - step forbush decrease , but only 13 two - step forbush decrease events were observed .",
    "therefore , they proposed to discard the classical two - step forbush decrease model and suggested to consider the possible contribution of local small - scale magnetic structure within icme in forbush decrease @xcite .",
    "moreover , raghav et al ( 2016a ) , has summarized general features of forbush decrease profile ( see in figure  [ fig:7 ] ) and proposed a new classification scheme for forbush decrease phenomena .",
    "further , they concluded that not only the sub - structures ( shock - sheath and mc ) , but also localized structures within the sub - structure have effective role in forbush decrease profile @xcite .        in the light of the above discussion",
    ", it is important to study cosmic ray variations during shock - sheath and mc transit independently and further evaluate the influence of the local structures within substructures in detail .",
    "thus , the main objective of the present study is to unravel the cause behind the multi - step forbush decrease and the recovery of cosmic ray flux within the shock - sheath region .",
    "to understand the cosmic ray s response to the shock - sheath region , we have analyzed two icme induced forbush decrease events ( amplitude @xmath0 ) occurred on september 17 , 2000 and september 24 , 1998 from catalog of neutron monitor database ( nmdb at www.nmdb.eu ) .",

    "the presented data for each energy band is the average normalized neutron flux of all observatory comes under given energy band .    to investigate the structure of the icme ( shock - sheath and magnetic cloud topology ) of studied events",
    ", we have used one - minute and five - minute time resolution interplanetary data from omni database cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov .",

    "however , temporal evolution or / and third imf component contribution in magnetic structure can not be studied using this 2d - hodogram method .",

    "the commencement of shock at the @xmath25 bow - shock ( shown by first vertical red dash line ) can be identified by sudden sharp enhancement in imf , solar wind speed and proton density .",
    "the complete shock - sheath transit takes about @xmath26 ( region between two vertical red dash line ) .",
    "the cosmic ray flux starts decreasing well before the commencement of the shock .",

    "we can clearly observe the rotational structure ( semicircle ) of the imf in y - z plane .",
    "this rotational structure / flux - rope within the local region 2 of the icme shock - sheath seems responsible for the observed recovery of cosmic ray flux .      during second step decrease ( i.e. local region 3 ) , a steady variation in the total imf and its components @xmath20 and @xmath21 is observed , while the @xmath22 shows small fluctuation .",

    "interestingly , in local region 3 imf is steady ( non - decreasing strength ) and has down to dusk orientation .",
    "this is clear evidence of flux - rope formation in shock - sheath region .",
    "the steady and dawn to dusk oriented imf in flux - rope ( observed in region 3 ) could be responsible for the slow and gradual decrease in cosmic ray due to diffusion process .",
    "further , in local region 4 , total imf shows small enhancement with steady variations , however , all its components depicts small fluctuations superposed over the steady variations .",
    "the solar wind speed and plasma temperature shows steady variations while the proton density and plasma beta shows gradual enhancement followed with sudden decreases to its ambient value .",
    "the right bottom hodogram also depicts that the initial part of region 4 is fluctuating but rest of it shows oriented arc plane with different length .",
    "this region also has similar rotational structure ( flux - rope ) as observed in region 2 and 3 respectively except at the initial part i.e. at the transition region between shock - sheath and mc .",
    "moreover , during this transit , we have observed overall gradual decrease in cosmic ray flux .",
    "the enhanced imf field strength , along with the fluctuating imf components could result in observed cosmic ray flux decrease .",
    "the forbush decrease phenomenon is interpreted on the basis of diffusion of cosmic rays in convecting interplanetary magnetic field structures .",
    "these structures generally consist of two broad sub - structures , shock - sheath and flux rope ( mc ) .",
    "the shock - sheath is mainly characterized by presence of stochastic fluctuations of magnetic field , whereas mc is identified as an ordered magnetic structure @xcite . in general , the first step of forbush decrease is generally ascribed to shock - sheath and second one is to mc @xcite . to be precise , the model given by @xcite , which is based on diffusion of cosmic rays across the propagating diffusive barrier , is widely used to explain cosmic ray decrease during shock - sheath crossing .",
    "the one - step / gradual decrease in cosmic ray flux is the direct implication of this model .",
    "however , this model does not clarify the origin of multi - step decrease and/or recovery during shock - sheath transit .",
    "the one - step , the two - step and the multi - step complex events have been reported and suggests led to consider the contribution of local structures within the sub - structures in forbush decrease profile @xcite .",
    "but , which part of the shock - sheath or mc contributes to step / gradual decrease or / and in recovery of cosmic ray flux has remained as an open problem . here",
    ", we have carried out detailed investigation of the local magnetic structures within shock - sheath region and their contribution in cosmic ray decrease and/or recovery .        to address this issue ,",
    "we have examined two large forbush decrease events occurred on september 17 , 2000 and september 24 , 1998 .",
    "the first event shows only one - step decrease with recovery and second event shows two - step decrease with respective recoveries within the shock - sheath region .",
    "the 3d - hodogram method used in this work gave effective visualizations of magnetic configuration of the local structures formed within the shock - sheath region .",
    "moreover , this method explicitly differentiate the turbulent and ordered imf configuration .",
    "this study clearly demonstrates that ( i ) the random fluctuations ( i.e turbulence ) and strength of imf contributes in the cosmic ray decrease , ( ii ) the ordered structure with almost constant magnetic field participates in cosmic ray flux decrease , ( iii ) the ordered structure with declining magnetic field strength contributes in cosmic ray flux recovery .",
    "the generally accepted view is that the shock - front is turbulent due to plasma compression and heating which results in cosmic ray flux decrease .",
    "the presence of the ordered structure ( magnetic island / flux - rope ) in the shock - sheath is intriguing and their origin is unclear at present .",
    "there exists another possibility , that the ordered structure ( magnetic island / flux - rope ) evolves in the later part of the shock - sheath region as a consequence of plasma relaxation process  @xcite .",
    "the shock - sheath plasma is not perfectly conductive due to the presence of turbulence and hence , can reach to taylor state ( low potential energy ) by forming magnetic island like structures within shock - sheath .",
    "this newly evolved ordered structure within shock - sheath can contribute to recovery of cosmic ray flux .",
    "further , as the mc reconnection with shock - sheath may give rise to turbulent conditions which is in transition region , occurring between the sheath and mc . this process can be thought as follows : ( i ) magnetic reconnection give rise to electric field .",
    "( ii ) electric field accelerates charged particles .",
    "( iii ) acceleration process increases the kinetic energy .",
    "moreover , it should also increase the plasma temperature ( signature of this is evident in figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "( iv ) the net effect of this is the formation of turbulent region just before the mc .",
    "the possible visualization using artistic picture of icme ( shock - sheath and mc ) and evolved magnetic structure within shock - sheath is shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] . in summary , observations illustrate that the transition regions , which are in general turbulent , and the front edge of mc , with enhanced imf strength contributes in cosmic ray decrease .",
    "although , rest of the mc contributes in recovery of cosmic ray flux , due to the gradual decrease in magnetic field strength .",
    "it is also possible that as icme travels in interplanetary space , it drags away the already present magnetic island in solar wind .",
    "the shock - sheath material of icme is then contaminated by these structures and , therefore , magnetic island might appear as a part of the icme .",
    "these kind of structures may also originate from icme - icme , icme - cir , and/or icme - solar wind interactions .",
    "to conclude , the study explicitly shows that turbulent as well as ordered imf regions do exist in shock - sheath region .",
    "these ordered and turbulent regions affect cosmic ray flux variations distinctively .",
