    "analogous to photonic crystals , magnonic crystals ( mcs ) @xcite are magnetic meta - materials designed for the propagation of spin waves ( sws).@xcite based on their design , mcs exhibit a characteristic sw dispersion relation complete with bands and , sometimes , band gaps which can be tuned by controlling material and structural parameters as well as the strength and orientation of the bias magnetic field.@xcite this phenomenon makes mcs useful as potential candidates for the design of sw based signal processing and logic devices.@xcite    the knowledge of dispersion relation of a wave propagating through a medium is necessary to understand its transmission characteristics .",
    "although mcs have been a subject of intense study lately,@xcite reports on a time domain numerical calculation of dispersion relations of sws propagating in two - dimensional ( 2d ) mcs are very rare.@xcite as other analytical methods are available , the use of time domain simulations and spatial fourier transform to obtain the dispersion relation in a photonic or phononic crystal is rarely seen@xcite as well .",
    "we hope to fill that gap in research with this work .",
    "the underlying principles , over which the procedure described here is used , has been discussed more generally by us in ref .  . here",
    "too , we essentially use a micromagnetic simulator called object oriented micromagnetic framework@xcite ( oommf ) to obtain magnetization @xmath0 , as a function of position @xmath1 , and time @xmath2 .",
    "then we use a multi - domain discrete fourier transform to obtain the desired dispersion relation : sw power as a function of wavevector @xmath3 , and frequency @xmath4 .",
    "however , while simulating the magnetization dynamics in large ( ideally infinite@xcite ) 2d crystals , one can be expected to need far greater computational resources than during the simulations of their one - dimensional ( 1d ) counterparts.@xcite using a finite sample size may produce some spurious modes in the obtained dispersion relation.@xcite thus , the use of 2d periodic boundary condition@xcite ( pbc ) becomes mandatory in order to obtain good numerical resolution in wavevector and frequency domains while consuming finite computational resources .",
    "also , 2d crystals have more high symmetry directions when compared to their 1d analogues .",
    "different techniques will be required to obtain the results for different directions in the 2d reciprocal space covering the entire irreducible part of the brillouin zone ( bz).@xcite moreover , the signal which generates the waves will have to be carefully designed so that the resulting spectrum represents the physical dispersion relation of plane propagating sws . due to all these complications , a need to validate the results obtained here with a well established method , such as the plane wave method ( pwm)@xcite becomes very clear .    both oommf and pwm solve the following landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation:@xcite @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath7 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath8 is the gilbert damping constant .",
    "@xmath9 is the sum of the bias field @xmath10 , the excitation signal @xmath11 ( used in micromagnetic simulations ( ms ) only ) , the exchange field , the demagnetizing field and the magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "other factors like magnetostriction , should also be considered here if applicable .",

    "oommf uses the finite difference method ( fdm ) to solve eq .   as an ordinary differential equation in time and space ( derivatives with respect to space",
    "are hidden away in @xmath9 ) .",
    "pwm is based on the bloch wave formalism . as these two methods are fundamentally different in approach , some quantitative differences in results are to be expected . the results from both the methods and their differences have been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] for the antidot lattice ( adl ) . due to small lattice",
    "constant , the considered system is an exchange dominated one and consequently , the differences in dispersion relations along the bias magnetic field and perpendicular to it are subtle .",
    "these differences have been explored by calculating the iso - frequency contours in the wavevector space using both ms and the pwm .",
    "the iso - frequency contours are the curves of the constant frequency plotted in the wavevector space , they are wave counterparts of the fermi surfaces known from the theory of the solid state physics.@xcite the iso - frequency contours are very important tool for the analysis of the wave propagation phenomena , giving a deep insight into direction and velocity of propagating , reflected and refracted waves in artificial crystals .",
    "such type of analysis , while widely explored in photonic and phononic crystals for designing their metamaterials properties,@xcite is almost absent in magnonics .",
    "thus , developing the ability to compute these iso - frequency contours using ms can be a breakthrough in exploring magnonic metamaterials based on mc ; because the mss can be performed without approximation limited applicability of the pwm ( or other analytical methods@xcite ) , and thus yields experimentally realizable results even with complex magnetic configurations .",
    "we also plot the energy spectral density and phase distributions associated with different modes in the sw spectrum in order to understand their physical origin and explain any observed partial or complete bandgaps .",
    "finally , we use the method described here to obtain the sw dispersion relations in the case of 2d dot array where the sw propagation is mediated by inter - dot stray magnetic field as opposed to dipole - exchange interaction in adl .",
    "this brings about an interesting change in the spectra , which is discussed in sec .",

    "the negative refraction , unidirectional media or caustic propagations are only some of examples here.@xcite further , this method can be generalized to aid the numerical computation of dispersion or iso - frequency contours in the case of two- or three - dimensional phononic@xcite and photonic@xcite crystals as well .",
    "the dispersion here appeared to be similar in @xmath34 and @xmath37 directions .",
    "however , a noticeable anisotropy between the backward volume and damon - eshbach geometries was very evident from the study of the mode profiles and the iso - frequency contours . as dipole field mediates the sw propagation in a 2d dot array we were able to obtain the negative group velocity associated with the first mode in the case of a backward volume magnetostatic configuration .",
    "we were also able to analyze the nature of bands and complete and partial bandgaps that were obtained from the dispersion calculations in the case of an mc .",
    "this can be useful in the design of attenuators,@xcite phase - shifters,@xcite filters@xcite and logic gates.@xcite    recent advances in lithography techniques@xcite have made it possible to fabricate dot and antidot lattices with a resolution below 10 nm .",
    "thus , one can fabricate samples with dimensions comparable to the systems considered here .",
    "experimental techniques similar to brillouin light scattering spectroscopy@xcite can be used to explore the sw dispersion relation .",

    "<S> we present the observation of a complete bandgap and collective spin wave excitation in two-dimensional magnonic crystals comprised of arrays of nanoscale antidots and nanodots , respectively . considering that the frequencies dealt with here fall in the microwave band , </S>",
    "<S> these findings can be used for the development of suitable magnonic metamaterials and spin wave based signal processing . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the application of a numerical procedure , to compute the dispersion relations of spin waves for any high symmetry direction in the first brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained from this procedure has been reproduced and verified by the well established plane wave method for an antidot lattice , when magnetization dynamics at antidot boundaries is pinned . </S>",
    "<S> the micromagnetic simulation based method can also be used to obtain iso  frequency countours of spin waves . </S>",
    "<S> iso  </S>",
    "<S> frequency contours are analougous of the fermi surfaces and hence , they have the potential to radicalize our understanding of spin wave dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the physical origin of bands , partial and full magnonic bandgaps has been explained by plotting the spatial distribution of spin wave energy spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> although , unfettered by rigid assumptions and approximations , which afflict most analytical methods used in the study of spin wave dynamics , micromagnetic simulations tend to be computationally demanding . thus , the observation of collective spin wave excitation in the case of nanodot arrays , which can obviate the need to perform simulations may also prove to be valuable . </S>"
