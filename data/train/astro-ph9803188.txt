    "it is widely believed that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) will become the premier laboratory for the study of the early universe and classical cosmology .",
    "this belief relies on the high precision of the upcoming map and planck surveyor satellite missions and the high accuracy of theoretical predictions of cmb anisotropies given a definite model for structure formation ( @xcite  1995 ) . to realize the potential of the cmb",
    ", aspects of structure formation affecting anisotropies at only the percent level in power must be taken into account .",
    "a great uncertainty in models for structure formation is the extent and nature of reionization .",
    "fortunately , this uncertainty is largely not reflected in the cmb anisotropies due to the low optical depth to thomson scattering at the low redshifts in question .",
    "reionization is known to be essentially complete by @xmath0 from the absence of the gunn - peterson effect in quasar absorption spectra ( @xcite  1965 ) .",
    "significant reionization before @xmath1 will be ruled out once the tentative detections of the cmb acoustic peaks at present are confirmed ( @xcite 1995 ) .",
    "it should be possible to deduce the reionization redshift @xmath2 through cmb polarization measurements ( @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the duration of time spent in a partially ionized state will remain uncertain .",
    "moreover as emphasized by @xcite ( 1984 ) secondary anisotropies generated by the doppler effect in linear perturbation theory are suppressed on small scales for geometric reasons ( gravitational instability generates potential flows , leading to cancellations between positive and negative doppler shifts ) .",
    "higher order effects which are not generally included in the theoretical modeling of cmb anisotropies are likely to be the main source of secondary anisotropies from reionization below the degree scale .",
    "such effects rely on modulating the doppler effect with spatial variations in the optical depth",
    ". incarnations of this general mechanism include the vishniac effect from linear density variations ( @xcite1987 ) , the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect from clusters ( @xcite1970 ) , and the effect considered here : the spatial variation of the ionization fraction .",
    "reionization commences when the first baryonic objects form stars or quasars that convert a part of the nuclear or gravitational energy into uv photons .",
    "each such source then blows out an ionization sphere around it .",
    "before these regions overlap is a period when the universe is ionized in patches .",
    "the extent of this period and the time evolution of the size and number density of these patches depend on the nature of the ionizing engines in the first baryonic objects",
    ". theories of reionization do not give robust constraints ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite  1994 ; @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1998 ) .",
    "we therefore take a phenomenological approach to studying the effects of patchy reionization on the cmb .",
    "we introduce a simple but illustrative three parameter model for the reionization process based on the redshift of its onset @xmath2 , the duration before completion @xmath3 , and the typical comoving size of the patches @xmath4 .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the cmb anisotropies generated by the patchiness of the ionization degree of the intergalactic medium .",
    "we find that only the most extreme models of reionization can produce degree scale anisotropies that are observable in the power spectrum given the cosmic variance limitations .",
    "a large signal on degree scales requires early ionization , @xmath5 , long duration , @xmath6 , and ionization in very large patches , @xmath7mpc .",
    "thus the patchiness of reionization is unlikely to affect cosmological parameter estimation from the acoustic peaks in the cmb ( @xcite1996 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the patchy reionization signal on the sub - arcminute scale can , in principle , surpass both the primary and the secondary vishniac signals",

    "consider the following patchy reionization scenario .",
    "the universe was reionized in randomly distributed patches with a characteristic comoving size @xmath4 .",
    "the patches appeared at random in space and time .",
    "once a reionized patch appears , it moves with matter .",
    "the average ionization fraction , that is the filling fraction of fully ionized patches , grows monotonically from @xmath32 at high redshifts to @xmath33 at low redshifts .",
    "we consider late reionization ( optical depth to thomson scattering is small ) and small patches ( smaller than the characteristic length scale of the peculiar velocity field ) .",
    "we assume that reionization occurred at redshift @xmath2 , and the patchy phase duration is given by @xmath3 .",
    "the angular scale of the patchy signal is given by the ratio of the size of patches to the distance to them in comoving coordinates , @xmath34 .",
    "assuming that the patches are uncorrelated , the spectrum of fluctuations should be white noise above this scale which agrees with the exact result as we shall see ( eq .  [ [ eqn : cl ] ] ) .",
    "the rms cmb temperature fluctuation @xmath35 on scales @xmath36 due to the patchiness can be estimated as follows . since , by assumption , different patches are independent , @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the number of patches on a line of site , @xmath39 is a temperature fluctuation from one patch , @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the rms peculiar velocity at redshift @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the optical depth for one patch , @xmath44 .",
    "the number of patches @xmath45 .",
    "collecting all the factors , we get the following estimate for the rms anisotropies from patches @xmath46 which again agrees with the exact result ( eq .  [ [ eqn : amplitude ] ] , up to a dimensionless multiplier ) .      we can factor the general expression for the temperature correlation ( [ eqn : correlationgeneral ] ) as @xmath47 this assumes that @xmath15 and @xmath11 are independent random fields .",
    "this is not strictly correct .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath15 must be determined by the density perturbation @xmath48 , and the density perturbation is not independent of the peculiar velocity ( for example in the linear regime @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , the ionizing radiation is presumably coming from strongly nonlinear objects , where first stars or quasars are lightening up . at high @xmath42 ,",
    "the length scales where the density is nonlinear are @xmath50mpc comoving , which is much smaller than the length scales contributing to the peculiar velocity . under the assumption of scale separation , velocity and density ( and hence @xmath15 )",
    "are indeed independent .",
    "the correlation function for the local ionization fraction @xmath51 is not known .",
    "our model parameterizes the correlation function through the the patch size @xmath4 and a mean ( cosmic time - dependent ) ionization fraction @xmath52 , @xmath53 e^{-{({\\bf x}_1-{\\bf x}_2)^2\\over 2r^2}}\\qquad . \\label{eqn : xexemodel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 .",
    "the gaussian function is chosen for simplicity ; it could have been any function of the separation @xmath55 which equals 1 at @xmath56 and gradually turns to zero at @xmath57 . for the mean ionization fraction @xmath58",
    "we assume a change from 0 to 1 at a redshift @xmath2 , with the transition occurring in a redshift interval @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume @xmath59 ( this is true in all of the models of reionization that we are aware of ) .",
    "cmb anisotropies generated ( and erased ) due to the spatially constant part of the correlation function ( [ eqn : xexemodel ] ) are obviously the same as in the model with a uniform time - dependent reionization .",
    "the spatially varying part is responsible for generating new anisotropies ; its contribution to erasing the primary anisotropies is negligible .",
    "the anisotropy suppression is mainly determined by the total optical depth to thomson scattering and is insensitive to the small - scale structure of the ionization fraction @xmath60 .",
    "the cmb correlation function due to the patchy part only is @xmath61 where we denote @xmath62 .",
    "the correlation function is non - negligible only for @xmath63 . by assumption",
    ", @xmath4 is much smaller then the characteristic scale of the peculiar velocity field .",
    "also @xmath63 requires that the lines of sight @xmath64 and @xmath65 be nearly parallel .",
    "then @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mean squared peculiar velocity today . for @xmath68 , the integral ( [ eqn : cthetaintegral ] )",
    "is dominated by small conformal times , and we have @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70 we assume that @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) and that during the patchy phase , @xmath73 , the ionization fraction @xmath58 grows linearly from 0 to 1 such that eventually both hydrogen and helium are fully ionized .",
    "then @xmath74 where the characteristic angular scale is @xmath75 and the amplitude is @xmath76 note that a critical matter - dominated universe is assumed in this expression . to generalize this result",
    "replace @xmath77 by the comoving angular diameter distance in equation  ( [ eqn : angularscale ] ) and a factor of @xmath78 in equation  ( [ eqn : amplitude ] ) with the appropriate velocity growth factor .",
    "the signal from patchy reionization in our model depends on four quantities : the rms peculiar velocity @xmath85 today , the redshift of reionization @xmath2 , its duration @xmath3 and the characteristic comoving size of the patches @xmath4 .",
    "the structure formation model specifies the power spectrum of fluctuations which in turn tells us the rms peculiar velocity .",
    "let us now consider the patchy reionized signal in the context of a specific model for structure formation .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "let us consider a cold dark matter model with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and a scale - invariant @xmath88 spectrum of initial fluctuations . normalizing the spectrum to the cobe detection via the fitting formulae of @xcite ( 1997 ) ( their equations [ 17]-[20 ] ) and employing the analytic fit to the transfer function of @xcite ( 1998 ) ( their equations [ 15]-[24 ] ) we find an rms velocity of @xmath89 .",
    "with the present optical depth of @xmath90 , we have a maximal anisotropy of @xmath91 at @xmath92.\\ ] ]    the power spectrum of the model in principle also tells us the remaining parameters of the ionization : its redshift @xmath2 , duration @xmath3 and typical patch size @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , these quantities depend on details of the cooling and fragmenting of the first baryonic objects to form the ionizing engines .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath93 which spans the range of estimates in the literature ( @xcite  1994 ; @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1998 ) .",
    "reionization , once it commences , is generally completed in a time short compared with the expansion time at that epoch @xmath94 by the coalescence of patches that are small compared with the horizon at the time @xmath95 at the time .",
    "again the exact relations depend on the efficiency with which the first objects form and create ionizing radiation ( see e.g. @xcite  1994 ) .",
    "let us consider an extreme example of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "then the maximal power is @xmath99 at @xmath100 , the primary signal at these scales is @xmath101  the contribution of the patchy reionization is small in comparison ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : patch10 ] ) .",
    "however , in light of the high precision measurements expected from the map and planck satellites such a signal is not necessarily negligible .",
    "the ultimate limit of detectability through power spectrum measurements is provided by so - called cosmic variance .",
    "this arises since we can only measure @xmath102 realizations of any given multipole such that power spectrum estimates will vary by @xmath103 detection of a broad feature such as that from patchy reionization is assisted in that we may reduce the cosmic variance by averaging over many @xmath104 s .",
    "we show an example of this averaging in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch10 ] ( lower left boxes ) . in this model , the patchy reionization signal can be detected at the several @xmath105 level if cosmic variance were the main source of uncertainty .",
    "of course a realistic experiment also has noise and systematic errors .",
    "we also show the noise error contributions expected from the map experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch10 ] .    an important additional source of uncertainty",
    "is provided by other unknown aspects of the model .",
    "indeed it is hoped that the cmb power spectrum can be used to measure fundamental cosmological parameters to high precision .",
    "excess variance from patchy reionization can in principle cause problems for cosmological parameter estimation from the cmb if not included in the model .",
    "it would remain undetected and produce parameter misestimates if its signal can be accurately mimicked by variations in the other parameters .",
    "fortunately , the angular signature we find here  @xmath106 white noise until some cut off due to the patch size  does not resemble the signature of other cosmological parameters which alter the positions and amplitudes of the acoustic peaks ( see @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "coupled with the small amplitude of the effect on the 10 arcminute to degree scale for even this extreme model , it is unlikely that patchy reionization will significantly affect parameter estimation through the cmb .",
    "we have called the ( @xmath107 ) model extreme , because of the size of patches ; the reionization redshift and duration would be considered reasonable by a number of theories .",
    "for example the early quasar model of haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) does predict @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "however , their `` medium quasar '' emits only @xmath110 ionizing photons during its life time .",
    "these photons can not ionize a bubble larger than @xmath111mpc comoving .",
    "perhaps more interesting is the case where reionization takes place at a higher redshift with for example @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the reduction in the patch size causes the signature to move to smaller angles where the primary signal is negligible due to dissipational effects at recombination .",
    "the increase in the optical depth at this higher redshift is counterbalanced by the reduction in the rms fluctuation due to the number of patches along the line of site such that the amplitude of the signal increases only moderately . here",
    "the maximal power is @xmath115 at @xmath116 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : patch30 ] ) .",
    "patchy reionization effects exceed the vishniac signal at these scales ( @xmath117 ) which is believed to be the leading other source of secondary anisotropies ( @xcite  1996 ) .",
    "although the morphology and amplitude of the patchy reionization and vishniac signals are similar , the vishniac effect is fully specified by the ionization redshift and the spectrum of initial fluctuations and hence may be removed once these are determined from parameter estimation at larger angular scales . likewise , since the rms peculiar velocity @xmath118 and the ionization redshift @xmath2 will be specified by the large scale observations , the amplitude of the signal can be used to estimate the duration of reionization @xmath3 and its angular location the typical comoving size of the bubbles @xmath4 .    in summary",
    ", the patchiness of reionization leaves a potentially observable imprint on the cmb power spectrum , but one that is unlikely to affect cosmological parameter estimation from the acoustic peaks in the cmb .",
    "we show how the signature scales with the gross properties of reionization  its redshift , duration , and typical patch size .",
    "observational detection of this signature would provide useful constraints on the presently highly uncertain reionization scenarios but will likely require experiments with angular resolution of an arcminute or better and foreground subtraction at better than the @xmath119 level ."
