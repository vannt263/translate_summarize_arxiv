    "<S> gw150914 is more massive ( beyond @xmath6 ) than typical bbhs merging in @xmath0 even for the lowest metallicity ( @xmath9 ) clusters we consider , but is within @xmath10 of the intrinsic mass distributions from clusters with @xmath11 . of course , accounting for aligo detectability would push the intrinsic distributions towards higher masses , hence the _ detection _ of merging bbhs as massive as gw150914 would be less rare . since cluster dynamics typically increases bbh masses via exchange encounters relative to what could form in isolation , mergers of bbhs </S>",
