    "for the last two decades , mathematical physicists and mathematicians have formulated and have been developing mathematical constructions known as topological field theories ( tfts , for a review see , e.g. , ref . [ ] ) .",
    "tfts come in two types : schwartz - type or quantum tfts and witten - type or cohomological tfts ( w - tfts ) .",
    "quantum tfts already found their applications - they are believed to stand behind exotic low - temperature phases of condensed matter systems such as fractional quantum hall effects and superconductors ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] and refs . therein ) . as to the w - tfts , to the best of our knowledge they are still used only for purely mathematical purposes .",
    "from the discussion in this paper it will follow that w - tfts is actually the path - integral version of the dynamical systems theory .",
    "the later , in turn , has many applications in modern science .",
    "it is well known that the most general parisi - sourlas - wu ( psw ) stochastic quantization procedure @xcite applied to langevin equations leads to n=2 ( quasi-)hermitian supersymmetric models ( witten models , see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "it is also known that deterministic conservative ( classical , hamilton ) dynamical systems viewed as path - integrals also possess supersymmetry .",
    "@xcite the above supersymmetries are of topological origin .",
    "@xcite in this paper , it is demonstrated that topological supersymmetry is pertinent to any deterministic or stochastic continuous - time dynamical model in its path - integral representation .",
    "based on this and on the possibility of the spontaneous breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by two different mechanisms , a generic phase diagram for dynamical models is proposed .",
    "the phase diagram is given in fig.[figure4]b .",
    "as quantum field theories , w - tfts that show up on psw quantization are non - hermitian .",
    "therefore , our proposition relies strongly on recent developments in the theory of non - hermitian quantum dynamics .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[stochquantization ] , it is demonstrated that any stochastic or deterministic continuous dynamical model is a w - tft . in sec.[whitenoise ] , we focus on models with white noise .",
    "non - hermitianity of the models ( sec.[nonhermitianity ] ) , their spectrum and physical states ( sec.[pathintegralsection ] ) , _ etc .",
    "_ , are addressed . in sec.[vacuadetermin ] , the meaning of the ground states in deterministic limit is analyzed .",
    "it is shown that in cases of unbroken topological symmetry the collection of ( bra s ) ket s of the perturbative ground states is the representation of the ( anti-)instantonic cw - complex of the phase space . in turn , the global ground states represent stable and unstable manifolds that intersect on invariant manifolds . sec .",
    "[ unbrokensymmetry ] is devoted to models with unbroken topological symmetry , and , in particular , to langevin models .",
    "it is also discussed how w - tft s with no physical quantum excitations represent stochastically fluctuating dynamical models ( sec.[explanation ] ) . in sec.[spontanbroken ] , models with spontaneously broken topological symmetry are addressed . qualitative difference of dynamics with spontaneously broken topological symmetry is discussed in general terms in sec.[qualitativedifference ] . particularly , it is proposed that such concepts of dynamical systems theory and complexity theory as self - similarity , sensitivity to initial conditions , non - markovianity _ etc_. are actually mere consequences of the goldstone theorem .",
    "two mechanisms of spontaneous topological symmetry breaking are identified : on the mean - field level , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the deterministic limit , and due to the dynamical condensation of instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "it is argued that these two mechanisms corresponds respectively to chaos ( sec.[chaos ] ) and intermittency / soc ( sec.[soc ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ nonequilibrium ] , non - equilibrium dynamics such as quenches or barkhausen effect is briefly addressed in the context of w - tfts .",
    "[ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "dynamical systems are those that are defined by specifying their equations of motion .",
    "this is the most general class of models as compared to , say , the equations of motions that follow from least action principle .",
    "the equations of motion can be either step - like equations or time - continuous equations .",
    "this paper deals with time - continuous evolutions only .",
    "continuous dynamics can be referred to as physical dynamics since time is always continuous in physical systems .",
    "the equations of motion can be either stochastic or deterministic ( partial ) differential equations ( sde or dde ) .",
    "dde s can be looked upon as sde s with zero - variance noises .",
    "therefore , it suffices to construct a path - integral formulation for an sde , and the theory of a corresponding deterministic model will follow by sending the parameters of the noise to their deterministic limit .",
    "thus , sdes are of primary interest",
    ".    the procedure of building a partition function out of an sde is called stochastic quantization .",
    "there are two major stochastic quantization procedures : psw method @xcite and martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) method .",
    "@xcite as is discussed below , msr is an approximation to the most general psw method that we use in this paper .",
    "consider an sde in its most general form : @xmath1 here @xmath2 with @xmath3 being some riemannian base space having the meaning of spacetime and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being an infinite - dimensional space of all maps from @xmath3 to a topological target manifold , @xmath6 . in eq .",
    "( [ sdegeneral ] ) , @xmath7 s have the meaning of a dde and @xmath8 s is the stochastic noise .",
    "@xmath7 s are some functionals of @xmath9 s and may have explicit dependence on the base .",
    "both @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s belong to the tangent space of @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 s and @xmath8 s can also be thought of as sections of the tangent bundle @xmath12 .",
    "the noise must obey an important physical condition .",
    "it must experience no feedback from the system .",
    "if there is such a feedback , the noise should be viewed as a part of the system rather than as an external source of stochasticity .",
    "this condition , however , does not necessarily suggest that the stochastic correlators of the noise have no functional dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "for example , below we concentrate on models where the noise is decoupled from the system but its correlators are functions of @xmath9 .",
    "this possible dependence of the correlators of the noise on @xmath9 s is emphasized by the explicit dependence of the noise on @xmath9 in the rhs of eq.([sdegeneral ] ) .",
    "the above condition only suggests that there exists an invertible transformation of @xmath13 : @xmath14 that decouples the stochastic variables from @xmath9 s .",
    "an example of such a transformation is given in eq.([transfromationexmple ] ) .",
    "the partition function of new stochastic variables is : @xmath15 } 1 \\cdot e^{-s_\\text{noise}(\\tilde\\xi)},\\label{partitionfunctionnoise}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is independent of @xmath17 s .    in eq.([partitionfunctionnoise ] ) and in the following the double integral sign denotes functional integration .",
    "@xmath18 is a common notation denoting a vacuum expectation value in the theory of quantum non - hermitian models , which the models we consider here will turn out to be .",
    "we accept this notation from the very beginning of our discussion .    now",
    ", the original sde ( [ sdegeneral ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the functional transformation from eq.([xitransform ] ) applied to @xmath7 s .",
    "eq.([transfromsdewhite ] ) below is an example of the transformed sde ( [ transformedsde ] ) .",
    "we assume that the noise is `` decent '' and for any , @xmath21 , there exist a unique and well - defined functional @xmath22 where @xmath23 s are the irreducible stochastic correlators for @xmath24 s . here and in the following the factors representing the metric on @xmath3",
    "are assumed whenever appropriate .    the inverse functional transformation in eq . ( [ inversepartitionfunction ] )",
    "is well defined , _",
    "e.g. _ , when the noise has only one `` vacuum '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , only one solution for @xmath25 .",
    "this vacuum must be stable and non - degenerate so that all the eigenvalues of @xmath26 are positive .",
    "such `` instanton - free '' noises can be called markovian in the context of this paper .    the first step toward a w - tft , which to the best of our knowledge belongs to parisi and sourlas , @xcite is very natural .",
    "it is the realization of the fact that the only partition function a stochastic system may in principle have is that of its noise , eq.([partitionfunctionnoise ] ) .",
    "indeed , the partition function is the summation over all the realizations of a stochastic process , which is actually @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , if we want that the `` number '' of the noise s degrees of freedom be the same as the number of the system s degrees of freedom we must consider only temporally periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is nothing else but the equilibrium situation that we will consider mostly .",
    "the second step is to rewrite the partition function in terms of @xmath17 s rather than @xmath24 s .",
    "let us now recall that in the theory of supersymmetric models there is a concept of nicolai maps .",
    "@xcite it says that for theories with global supersymmetry one can come up with such a transformation of bosonic variables , that the partition function will fold into that of a noise because the jacobian of the variable s transformation will cancel the fermionic determinant .",
    "what we need to do now is essentially the opposite .",
    "we have to unfold the partition function of the noise into some other model and rightfully anticipate that the model will possess a global supersymmetry - topological supersymmetry ( @xmath0-symmetry ) .",
    "the partition function of the noise is rewritten as @xmath28 } \\delta(\\tilde f^a - \\tilde \\xi^a ) j e^{-s_\\text{noise}(\\tilde \\xi)},\\label{transformationvar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the jacobian of the variable transformation .",
    "the @xmath30-functional limits the integration over @xmath5 only to the solutions of the sde , that serves as an `` inverse '' nicolai map . in order to bring eq.([transformationvar ] ) back to eq.([partitionfunctionnoise ] ) , one must integrate out @xmath24 s and notice that the outcome is actually eq.([partitionfunctionnoise ] ) with @xmath24 s substituted by @xmath17 s according to the variable transformation specified by eq.([transformedsde ] ) .",
    "the jacobian of the variable transformation is important . without it , eq.([transformationvar ] ) is not the same as eq.([partitionfunctionnoise ] ) and thus does not represent the stochastic process under consideration . neglecting",
    "the jacobian is the mathematical essence of the msr stochastic quantization procedure .",
    "therefore , msr picture can only serve as an approximation , while the psw stochastic quantization procedure , the one we use here , is always correct .    in the standard fashion , one introduces the lagrange multiplier , @xmath31 , to incorporate the @xmath30-functional :    [ help ] @xmath32 } e^{i\\int_r b_a(\\tilde f^a - \\tilde \\xi^a)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here and in the next formula , @xmath33 denotes equality up to an unimportant constant .",
    "one also introduces the set of the fadeev - popov ghosts , @xmath34 , integration over which provides the desired jacobian @xmath35 } e^{-i\\int_{rr'}\\bar\\chi_a ( \\delta { \\tilde f}^a/ \\delta \\tilde \\varphi^b ) \\chi^b}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on inserting eqs.([help ] ) into eq.([transformationvar ] ) one obtains @xmath36 } e^{i\\left\\{\\mathcal{q } , \\int_{r}\\bar\\chi_a(\\tilde f^a - \\tilde\\xi^a)\\right\\ } - s_\\text{noise}(\\tilde\\xi)}.\\label{intermediatepartitionfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here and in the following @xmath37 stands for the collection of all the fields @xmath38 .",
    "these fields constitute what could be called the supersymmetric extension of @xmath12 . in eq.([intermediatepartitionfunction ] ) , we introduced the operator of the gauge - fixing becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin supersymmetry , which is the @xmath0-symmetry : @xmath39 here and in the following @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) denotes functional ( or partial ) differentiation over its subscript .",
    "operator @xmath0 is a bi - graded differentiation , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ghost degree of @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath0 is nilpotent , @xmath45 , for any @xmath44 .",
    "out integration of the noise in eq.([intermediatepartitionfunction ] ) leads to @xmath46 } e^{i\\left\\{\\mathcal{q},\\int_{r}\\bar\\chi_a \\tilde f^a\\right\\ } + s^{-1}_\\text{noise } ( -i \\{\\mathcal{q},\\bar\\chi_a\\})}.\\label{intermediatepartitionfunction1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last term in the action is defined in eq.([inversepartitionfunction ] ) .",
    "this term is a functional of only @xmath0-exact pieces ( of the form @xmath47 ) and is @xmath0-exact itself because of the nilpotency of @xmath0 : @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 } e^{i\\ { \\mathcal{q } , \\theta \\}},\\label{wtftpartitionfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the so - called gauge fermion given by @xmath49 the last term in this expression comes from the noise and for deterministic models it vanishes .",
    "a @xmath50-exact action is the unique feature of w - tfts that all look like a gauge fixing of `` nothing '' . that the psw method leads to a w - tft",
    "comes with no surprise .",
    "the point is that we are computing the partition function of the `` ignorant '' external noise , which does not really care about the lhs of eq.([transformedsde ] ) .",
    "therefore , the deformation of the sde must not result in any changes in the partition function - a feature pertinent to w - tfts .",
    "topological nature of models with @xmath0-exact actions and with non - trivial topological",
    "content can be in particular revealed by the provided possibility to calculate on instantons certain topological invariants as expectation values of collections of certain @xmath0-closed operators also known as bps ( bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ) operators .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , even w - tfts with topologically trivial content are of topological origin - in ref.@xcite , any model with a @xmath0-exact action has been given an interpretation of a generalized morse theory on @xmath5 .",

    "e.g. _ , ref . [ ] and refs . therein ) .",
    "this concept shows up naturally on the psw quantization .",
    "consider , _",
    "e.g. _ , a nearly - deterministic gaussian noise , @xmath54 , in a ( 0 + 0 ) theory .",
    "the partition function is : @xmath55 here , @xmath56 with @xmath57 , the second integral is over a new variable that is related to @xmath8 through some many - to - one function , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the new probability density with @xmath60 being the jacobian of the variable transformation , and the last equality sign establishes the connection to the discussion in the previous subsection with @xmath61 .",
    "new probability distribution is given in fig.([figure1 ] ) .",
    "in those regions where the jacobian is negative , @xmath52 is also negative .",
    "these negative probabilities are necessary for the partition function to be equal to the partition function of the original stochastic process .",
    "they always appear paired with new positive probabilities and thus are clearly of topological origin - the simplest realization of the poicre - hoft theorem .",
    "a mathematician would probably say that @xmath52 is a pullback of @xmath62 by the irreversible many - to - one map , @xmath63 . the original @xmath62 is non - negative and thus can be interpreted as a volume form for @xmath8 . from this point of view , the stochastic quantization is the procedure of `` borrowing '' the volume from the noise , so that the total volume in the new variables ( the total probability to exist ) remains the same as in eq.([example ] ) .",
    "this simple example suggests the following stochastic interpretation of negative probabilities .",
    "if a stochastic variable has negative probabilities , it means that its partition function actually represents / calculates a partition function of yet another `` physical '' stochastic variable ( noise ) with ordinary positive probability .",
    "the two stochastic variables must be related through some irreversible many - to - one map , _",
    "e.g. _ , through a highly nonlinear sde .    on the side of stochastic dynamics ,",
    "our temporary understanding of the negative probabilities is this . for a specific configuration of the noise",
    ", a nonlinear sde may have a multitude of solutions that in the high energy physics terms are called gribov copies .",
    "the system has a freedom to chose which one of the gribov copies is going to be realized .",
    "we can not know which one of the gribov copies the stochastic system is going to chose .",
    "only this chosen copy must contribute to the partition function .",
    "at the same time , we have to integrate over all the possible configurations of the systems variables ( over the entire @xmath5 ) and all the gribov copies are going to contribute .",
    "this would necessary lead to overcounting unless some of the gribov copies are contributing -1 instead of 1 due to that the probability density is negative in the corresponding regions of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , negative probabilities represent the freedom of a stochastic system to chose among various competing solutions of its sde . from the forthcoming discussion",
    ", it follows that this freedom gets physically realized only in @xmath0-broken phases .",
    "for the following discussion we do not need the generality of the previous section .",
    "we assume that spacetime , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is time and the space , @xmath66 , is flat ( _ e.g. _ , a torus @xmath67 , _",
    "i.e. _ , periodic boundary conditions ) . in equilibrium situations",
    "@xmath68 , while in non - equilibrium cases @xmath69 .",
    "we discuss mostly the equilibrium situations .",

    "@xmath72 can be though of as a vector field over the ( infinite - dimensional ) phase space , @xmath73 , of all maps from the space to the target : @xmath74 .",
    "the noise is assumed gaussian and white : @xmath75 where @xmath76 has the meaning of the metric on @xmath6 , which is a function of only @xmath77 s at this specific @xmath78 .",
    "eq.([reducedsde ] ) and/or eq.([wtftpartitionfunction ] ) with eq.([gaugefermionreduced ] ) below represent a very wide class of stochastic dynamical models . in particular , this class includes systems defined by sde s that are not first - order in time - derivative .",
    "one can bring such higher - order sde s to the form of eq .",
    "( [ reducedsde ] ) by the introduction of new fields . in case of kramer s equation",
    "this works like this : @xmath79 is rewritten as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a zero - variance gaussian noise .    the transformation that decouples the noise from @xmath9 s has the following form @xmath82 where @xmath83 s have the meaning of vielbeins : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the transformed sde from eq .",
    "( [ transformedsde ] ) takes the following form : @xmath86 straightforward application of the psw stochastic quantization procedure from the previous section to the partition function of the white noise : @xmath15 } e^{-\\int_r ( \\tilde\\xi^a)^2/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leads to a w - tft for the collection of fields , @xmath87 , with a @xmath0-exact action , @xmath88 , defined by the gauge fermion , @xmath89 , and the supersymmetry operator @xmath90 .",
    "it is more convenient , however , to introduce a new set of fields , @xmath91 , where @xmath77 and @xmath92 are the same , while @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 being the christoffel symbol .",
    "there are two things to note in this redefinition of the fields .",

    ".    we chose to work in the representation where @xmath9 s and @xmath102 s are diagonal .",
    "there are two reasons for this choice .",
    "first , these fields are superparthners .",
    "second , in this basis the nether charge associated with the topological symmetry is the exterior derivative that has no explicit dependence on the metric , which emphasizes the topological nature of the model .    in this basis , eq .",
    "( [ commutator ] ) suggests @xmath103 wavefunctions , @xmath104 , are functionals of @xmath9 s and @xmath102 s only .",
    "we can formally taylor expand in @xmath102 s : @xmath105 s and summation over @xmath106 s is assumed , and @xmath107 are antisymmetric in the pairs of subscripts due to the anticommutation composition law for the ghosts .",
    "for this reason , @xmath108 s can be interpreted @xcite as forms from the exterior algebra of @xmath73 which thus is the hilbert space , @xmath109 , of the model .    in eq.([ket ] ) , @xmath110 denotes the hedge star , which is introduced for convenience . within this definition , the probability density , which is a form of maximal degree , corresponds to @xmath111 as in eq.([probabilitydemsity ] ) below .",
    "the dynamical equation governing the time - evolution follows directly from the path - integral formulation in eq.([pathintergaltofokkerplank ] ) and is the generalized fokker - plank equation :    [ fokkerplankeq ] @xmath112 its time reversed version for bra s , @xmath113 , that are also forms on @xmath73 , is @xmath114    the hamitlonian in eqs.([fokkerplankeq ] ) is the generalized fokker - plank hamiltonian .",
    "it s explicit form can be derived straightforwardly by the bi - graded symmetrization of its path - integral expression and with the use of eq.([operators ] ) .",

    "besides @xmath117 , the hamiltonian also conserves the number of ghosts given by the operator : @xmath119 in eq.([fphamiltonian ] ) , @xmath120 is what could be called the ( pseudo-)conjugate supercharge with @xmath121    being the adjoint of the exterior derivative .    in eq.([fphamiltonian ] ) , @xmath122_+$ ] is the laplace - beltrami operator , explicit form of which is provided by the weitzenbck formula , and @xmath123_+$ ] is the lie derivative along @xmath72 .",
    "we would also like to note , that formally the model is not a n=2 pseudo - supersymmetric in general for that reason that @xmath124 is not nilpotent , @xmath125 , and it is not commutative with the hamiltonian , @xmath126_-\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "because number of ghosts is the integral of motion , the time evolution does not mix wavefunctions of different ghost number .",
    "this , in particular , suggests that the time evolution of the wavefunction of the trivial ( or rather maximal ) ghost content : @xmath127 where ( @xmath128 s come from the hedge star in eq.([probabilitydemsity ] ) ) : @xmath129 is the conventional fokker - plank operator acting on the probability density , @xmath130 .",

    "notably , in stochastic quantization the probability density is not a `` square '' of a wave - function ( of trivial ghost content ) but rather the wave - function itself .",
    "the corresponding bra is actually the cycle over the entire @xmath73 .",

    "this interpretation can be supported within the tft formalism in the following manner .",
    "consider topological quantum mechanics with @xmath132-dimensional phase space .",
    "consider also stock s theorem : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a ( fixed , time - independent ) @xmath132-dimensional part of the phase space , @xmath135 is its ( @xmath136)-dimensional boundary , and @xmath131 is any wavefunction with @xmath136 ghosts .",
    "we know that @xmath137 has the meaning of probability density so that @xmath131 must have the meaning of the probability flow though @xmath135 .",
    "inductively , wavefunctions of even more non - trivial ghost content must have the meaning of currents of currents of probability etc . within this interpretation of wavefunctions ,",
    "the model complies with the continuous higher - dimensional version of kirchhoff s law . @xcite",
    "then , operator from eq.(26d ) must be identified as conductance ( or rather as conductance over capacitance ) .",
    "the previous stock s equality must hold at any moment of time and thus it shows that @xmath131 and @xmath138 evolve in time equivalently .",
    "time evolution for both is given by fokker - plank equation so that the fokker - plank hamiltonian must be commutative with @xmath117 , which is the nther charge of @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "in other words , if a theory describes a dynamical model in terms of probability , currents of probabilities etc . it must possess topological supersymmetry in order to be consistent with stock s theorem .",
    "this meaning of wavefunctions also suggests that statistical description ( in terms of probability density ) of stochastic models is not applicable when @xmath0-symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "indeed , @xmath139 automatically suggests that the ground state is not a ( pure ) probability density since @xmath140 for any @xmath111 .",

    "the comparison of spectra of models with broken and unbroken @xmath0-symmetry is given in fig.[figure2]b .",

    "[ ] . there",
    ", the supersymmetry relates probability currents and probability densities defined on a network .",
    "the direct analogy with our case is as follows : the supersymmetry is the exterior derivative , the network is the instantonic cw - complex , and , say , @xmath285 is the current between @xmath283 and @xmath299 .",
    "the important class of models with unbroken @xmath0-symmetry is the langevin sdes .",
    "they represent purely dissipative dynamics .",
    "this is the most studied class of dynamical systems in the context of w - tfts .",

    "in particular , @xmath301 must be bounded from below . as is seen , @xmath314 , with the conventional fokker - plank operator from eq.([cnvfpham ] ) , or , equivalently , @xmath315 .",
    "unconditional existence of this ground state suggests that @xmath0-symmetry is never broken for langevin sde s with physically meaningful @xmath301 s .",
    "the above discussion suggests that a model must have a non - potential part in its flow for the @xmath0-symmetry to be spontaneously broken . in physical terms , to break @xmath0-symmetry of a langevin sde one has to externally `` drive '' the system through its phase space by a non - potential flow .",
    "this driving is actually a well - documented condition for soc dynamics .",
    "@xcite    it is possible that there exist other classes of models with unbroken @xmath0-symmetry even in the presence of noise .",
    "one of the possible candidates is the conservative models .",
    "if it turns out to be true , one would say that a nearly conservative model must possess dissipative part in its drift term for @xmath0-symmetry to be broken .",
    "this is actually one of the conditions for the observation of chaotic behavior in nearly conservative models .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that in some subclass of stochastic conservative models @xmath0-symmetry is also unbroken .",
    "here we would like to address the following subtle point .",
    "it is known that w - tft s with unbroken @xmath204-symmetry do not possess physical excitations ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "[ ] as well as sec.[qsymmetrystates ] ) .",
    "this may sound suspicious : how can a theory with no quantum excitations represent a stochastically fluctuating system such as a langevin sde ? to get around this controversy , in ref .",
    "[ ] it was wrongfully conjectured that the psw stochastic quantization is applicable only to stochastic systems with slow colored noises that do not provide high enough frequencies for the system to fluctuate .",
    "this is not true - psw method is applicable to all dynamical models .",
    "the resolution of the seeming controversy is this .",
    "consider again langevin sdes as an example .",
    "they have only one physical ground state of trivial ghost content - the stationary probability distribution from eq.([stationarydistribution ] ) .",
    "this , however , does not mean that there are no stochastic fluctuations .",
    "the very necessity to use the probability distribution for the description of the model suggests that the bosonic variables fluctuate .",
    "these fluctuations , however , are in the sense of the zero quantum fluctuations within a ground state .    furthermore , w - tfts with unbroken @xmath0-symmetry provide perfectly defined correlators that represent the stochastic fluctuations in the bosonic variables .",
    "for example , the one - loop propagator for the fluctuating bosonic fields near an isolated stable critical point , @xmath225 , of a ( 0 + 1 ) theory ( not necessarily langevin ) is @xmath316 , where @xmath317 and @xmath318 is the one - loop ground state at @xmath225 .",
    "these correlators are not bps observables and thus belong to the general class of observables studied in refs .",
    "the above propagator is exactly the one - loop propagator that would follow from the more wide - spread msr approximation to stochastic quantization [ higher - order perturbative corrections will be different , however , due to the neglect of the contributions from the virtual ghosts in msr ] .",
    "in thinking about models with spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking , it is an important question on which level the symmetry is broken . for any global continuous symmetry , there are three such levels - the mean - filed level , the perturbative level also known as quantum anomaly , and by the dynamical condensation of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "the last possibility is particularly important for supersymmetries such as @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "@xcite the reason for this is that certain class of supersymmetries , including @xmath0-symmetry , can not be broken on the perturbative level .",
    "this is related to the concepts of the cancelation of bosonic and fermionic determinants , of the localization of path - intergals to classical solutions in w - tft s ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref . [ ] ) , and to non - renormalization theorems .",
    "this leaves out only two possibilities : @xmath0-symmetry can be broken either on the mean - field level ( which in our case corresponds to the deterministic limit ) or by the dynamical condensation of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "below we argue that these two situations represent respectively chaotic behavior ( sec .",
    "[ chaos ] ) and intermittent / soc dynamics ( sec . [ soc ] ) .",
    "dynamical ( anti-)instanton - mediated breaking of @xmath0-symmetry must not exist in the deterministic limit because of the disappearance of anti - instantons .",
    "nevertheless , in non - equilibrium situations such as quenches instantons are not required to be matched by anti - instantons and consequently instanton(s ) alone can break @xmath0-symmetry even in the deterministic limit.@xcite this possibility is briefly discussed in sec.[nonequilibrium ] .",
    "let us first , however , address some general aspects of @xmath0-symmetry broken dynamics .      models with unbroken and spontaneously broken @xmath0-symmetry must have qualitatively very different dynamics .",
    "this difference has a few separate points .",
    "allow us address some of them here .",
    "first , spontaneously broken @xmath0-symmetry results in the liberation of quantum dynamics in the following sense .",
    "if one randomly chooses a wavefunction , @xmath319 , and propagates it in time long enough , he will have : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{evolutionofwavefunction }    now it is seen that in case of unbroken @xmath0-symmetry , when the only physical states are the ground states with @xmath214 ( see fig.[figure2]b ) , the quantum evolution in eq.([evolutionofwavefunction ] ) stops . in",
    "contrary , if @xmath0-symmetry is spontaneously broken , the time evolution will never stop .",
    "if one would want to construct an effective field theory out of a @xmath0-broken model , he could as well try to write down a theory that covers the physical states only . such theory would necessary be hermitian .",
    "in other words , on physical states the fokker - plank equation becomes a schdinger equation without wick rotation , _",
    "i.e. _ , preserving the original meaning of time .",
    "this line of thinking can be useful for establishing a long - suspected connection between chaotic and quantum dynamics .",
    "e.g. _ , ref . [ ] ) w - tft s may provide a firm basis for such connection .",
    "second , goldstone theorem ensures that if a global continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken then there must exist a gapless particle . in case of @xmath0-symmetry ,",
    "the gapless particles are ghosts called goldstinos .",
    "goldstinos provide the system with long - range spatiotemporal correlations in some observables related to them .",
    "these long - range correlations are known under various names such as sensitivity to initial conditions , self - similarity , algebraic statistics of avalanches in soc dynamics , 1/f noise , non - markovian memory etc .",
    "such long - range correlations must not exist in models with unbroken @xmath0-symmetry that are thus could be called markovian dynamics .",
    "third , the time - reversal symmetry must also be broken in @xmath0-broken phases as was discussed in the end of sec.[qsymmetrystates ] .",
    "this must be related to the concept of irreversibility of , _",
    "e.g. _ , chaotic dynamics .     *",
    "( a ) * the spectrum of a toy model considered in sec.[refineddefinitionofchaos ] . in the deterministic limit , @xmath222",
    ", the fokker - plank eigenvalues tend to lay on the imaginary axis , as though @xmath0-symmetry is broken .",
    "this situation must also occur in other conservative models .",
    "as is explained in the text , this situation must not be viewed as the mean - field level @xmath0-symmetry breaking . *",
    "( b ) * the generic phase diagram of a stochastic dynamical system .",
    "it consists of three phases .",
    "the first is the chaotic phase , where the topological symmetry is broken on the mean - field level .",
    "the second phase is intermittent chaos or self - organized criticality , where the topological symmetry is dynamically broken by the condensation of instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "soc is not a `` critical state '' but rather is a full - dimensional phase .",
    "however , in the deterministic limit when antiinstantons disappear , the soc phase collapses into the critical `` edge of chaos '' .",
    "chaotic and soc phases must possess spatiotemporal self - similarity due to the existence of gapless goldstinos . the temporal aspect of the self - similarity represents dynamical non - markovian long - term memory . by the same token",
    ", the phase with unbroken topological symmetry can be called markovian dynamics ( md).,width=188,height=98 ]      as it follows from the previous subsection , models with spontaneously broken @xmath0-symmetry must have qualitatively very different behavior . in deterministic limit , there is only one class of dynamics general enough to be associated with the mean - field level spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking on the w - tft side .",
    "this class is the deterministic chaos .    in the deterministic limit",
    ", the effects of quantum - mechanical tunneling ( anti - instantons ) between perturbative ground states can be neglected .",
    "perturbative ground states discussed in sec.[vacuadetermin ] become a good approximation for unbroken @xmath0-symmetry cases .",
    "then , the rhs of eq.([evolutionofwavefunction ] ) for a randomly chosen initial probability distribution ( a wave - function of the maximal degree , @xmath319 ) is the sum over all the stable attracting invariant manifolds , while the overlapping coefficients , @xmath321 , are the integrals of @xmath319 over the corresponding attracting basins .",
    "the absence of quantum evolution means that the deterministic model with unbroken @xmath0-symmetry will always find its attractor and stay there forever . in contrary ,",
    "when @xmath0-symmetry is broken and the evolution nether stops , it must mean that a model is not capable of finding its topologically well - defined attractor - a feature pertinent to chaotic behavior .    yet",
    "another way to see that mean - field @xmath0-symmetry breaking must be associated with chaos it through considering models with fractal strange attractors . in such cases ,",
    "one will certainly find it difficult to represent such an invariant `` manifold '' ( formally a fractal is not a topological manifold ) as an intersection of forms , that the ground states are supposed to be in the unbroken @xmath0-symmetry models .",
    "the first problem here is the differentiability issue .",
    "the second problem is more fundamental .",
    "the point is that states can only be forms of integer degree .",
    "such forms can only represent integer dimensional manifolds but not fractals .",
    "looking at deterministic chaotic models as at the mean - field level @xmath0-symmetry breaking suggests why they must exhibit long - range correlations in observables related to ghosts .",
    "these correlations is the w - tft way to explain the high sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic models . in dynamical systems",
    "theory , this sensitivity is often considered as one of the necessary conditions for the system to be chaotic . on the w - tft side ,",
    "the sensitivity is the consequence of the goldstone theorem .",
    "furthermore , time - reversal symmetry of deterministic chaos must also be broken .",
    "this is most probably the w - tft way of encoding the temporal irreversibility of chaos .",
    "@xcite    the above reasons are only indications on the equivalence between deterministic chaos and mean - field level spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking .",
    "a rigorous prove of this equivalence has obstacles .",
    "one of them is the absence of the universal definition of deterministic chaos . from this perspective",
    ", one can as well think that w - tft s approach provides its own version of this definition .    if @xmath0-symmetry is broken in the deterministic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the mean - field level , the addition of noise will not restore it .",
    "in fact , as is discussed in the next subsection , the noise can only break @xmath0-symmetry if it was not broken on the mean - field level .",
    "stochastic models with @xmath0-symmetry broken on the mean - field level can be called stochastic chaos .",
    "so far , the w - tft definition of chaos is a model with @xmath0-symmetry spontaneously broken on the mean - field level .",
    "this definition needs further clarification .",
    "the reason for this is seen from the following example .",
    "consider a dynamical model on a circle , @xmath322 , of circumference , @xmath323 , with constant flow , @xmath72 .",
    "the operators defining the fokker - plank hamiltonian through eq.([fphamiltonian ] ) are : @xmath324 the eigenstates and the spectrum are known exactly : @xmath325 where @xmath326 $ ] and the momentum is @xmath327 .",
    "as is seen in fig.[figure4]a , the spectrum looks like that of broken @xmath0-symmetry in the strict deterministic limit , @xmath328 . on the other hand , for any small but finite noise , @xmath329 , the spectrum is that of unbroken @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "such situation must appear in all conservative models .    to get around this seeming controversy",
    ", we have to refine the definition of the mean - field level @xmath0-symmetry breaking and thus that of chaos .",
    "chaotic system is such that its @xmath0-symmetry is spontaneously broken in the limit of infinitely weak but finite noises .",
    "this weak but finite noise is related to the concept of sensitivity to initial condition on the dynamical systems side .",
    "to see if a deterministic model is sensitive to initial conditions one must consider infinitely close but still different initial points in the phase space .",
    "this can be interpreted as the addition of infinitely weak but still finite uncertainty ( noise ) .      in stochastic models",
    ", there is yet another mechanism for spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking .",
    "this mechanism is the dynamical condensation of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "@xcite we have already encountered instantons in sec.[vacuadetermin ] in the discussion of the ground states in the deterministic limit .",
    "let us , however , briefly recollect again on what these tunneling processes are .",
    "instatnons correspond to classical solutions of sde ( solution of a corresponding dde ) that start on one invariant manifold and end at another .",
    "thus , instantons always lead from `` less stable '' invariant manifolds to more stable ones .",
    "anti - instantons , in turn , are time - reversed instantons .",
    "they lead from more stable invariant manifolds to less stable ones .",
    "anti - instantons are essentially the motion against the flow , which is only possible in the presence of noise",
    ". matrix elements of anti - instantons always come with exponentially small factors that disappear in the deterministic limit . a hydrodynamical example of an instanton / antiinstanton is the processes of annihilation / creation of ( pairs of ) vortices or vortex lines .",
    "( anti-)instantons intrinsically break @xmath0-symmetry as , in particular , is seen in eq.([morse - witten ] ) , from which it follows that the matrix element of the expectation value of a @xmath0-symmetry operator on the @xmath330-instanton ( see fig.[figure3]b ) is non - zero : @xmath331 .",
    "in equilibrium situations , condensation of instantons must be accompanied by the condensation of antiinstantons .",
    "indeed , for the instantonic processes of annihilation of vortices to be happening forever they must be complemented by the antiinstantonic processes of creation of vortices . in other words , separately each ( anti-)instanton is ultimately non - equilibrium processes leading from one state to another . therefore , in equilibrium situations , only configurations of `` equal number '' of instantons and anti - instantons that lead from a state to itself exist .",
    "thus , in equilibrium , ( anti-)instanton - mediated dynamical @xmath0-symmetry breaking can only happen in stochastic but not deterministic models .    the dynamics in a phase with the ( anti-)instanton - mediated @xmath0-symmetry breaking must look as an infinite series of jumps ( _ e.g. _ , avalanches of sandpile models ) between different invariant manifolds .",
    "if the invariant manifolds are points in the phase space ( solitonic configurations , patterns etc . ) , we can talk about the dynamics as of a sequence of sudden changes in solitonic configuration .",
    "this is nothing else but the physical picture of soc .",
    "@xcite    in a more general case , these jumps happen not between points but between more intricate invariant manifolds ( _ e.g. _ , limit cycles ) . in this case",
    ", the term soc must be substituted by a more general concept of intermittency ( see . e.g. , ref.@xcite ) - in dynamical systems theory a system",
    "is called intermittent if it is subject to infrequent variations of large amplitude .",
    "these variations ( ( anti-)instantons ) separate periods of different ( quasi-)periodic behaviors . roughly speaking",
    ", the difference between intermittency and soc is that the jumps happen between limits cycles or more complicated higher - dimensional stable sets for the former and between stable points for the later .",
    "thus , soc is in a sense a subclass of intermittent behavior .",
    "we do not see , however , more fundamental difference between soc and intermittency and thus sometimes use these terms interchangeably .",
    "the conclusion we just arrived is that ( anti-)instanton - mediated @xmath0-symmetry broken phase must be associated with intermitency / soc .",
    "@xcite on the phase diagram , intermittent / soc phase must occupy a region between chaotic and markovian phases .",
    "importantly , intermittency / soc is not a critical state .",
    "it is a rightful full - dimensional phase , just as chaos and markovian systems .",
    "this explain why by moderate variation of parameters of the model one can not destroy intermittent / soc behavior .",
    "in the literature of soc , this fact is sometimes attributed to the mysterious tendency of soc systems to `` evolve '' to a critical `` edge of chaos '' .",
    "w - tft picture of intermittency / soc resolves this issue .    only in the deterministic limit ,",
    "anti - instantons vanish and intermittent / soc phase collapses into the `` edge of chaos '' ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref . [ ] ) .",
    "the above discussion is summarized in fig.([figure4]b ) where chaotic , intermittent / soc , and markovian phases are schematically presented .",
    "the proposed phase diagram complies with previous studies .",
    "one of the examples is the phase diagram of water moving between two rotating cylinders .",
    "@xcite the couette ( laminar ) flow phase can be identified with markovian phase , the featureless turbulence with chaos , while the intermediate region , where the dynamics is dominated by creation / annihilation of solitons in the form of vortices and vortex lines , must be identified with intermittency / soc . yet another example is neuroscience , where the three phases in fig.([figure4]b ) are often called respectively supercritical , critical , and subcritical phases .",
    "@xcite      let us also briefly address non - equilibrium situations . in these situations ,",
    "the temporal boundary conditions are not periodic and the system is allowed to end up in a state different from the initial state .",
    "physically , this corresponds to quenches for instance . quench dynamics can be assumed deterministic and it can be looked upon as a composite instanton leading from one of the metastable configurations to one of the stable configurations .",
    "barkhausen - like effects ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref . [ ] and refs . therein ) such as crumpling paper ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref . [ ] and refs .",
    "therein ) can effectively be viewed as `` slow '' quenches where the time evolution is due to varying external parameter .",
    "gradual variation of the external parameter ( _ e.g. _ , magnetic field in barkhausen effect ) makes previously stable configurations unstable ones thus initiating instantons , that look like a sequence of sudden jumps .",
    "as follows from the next paragraph , these models must also exhibit `` power - laws '' which is the reason why they also sometimes attributed to the soc family .",
    "mathematical aspects of non - equilibrium deterministic dynamics in potential flows ( langevin dde s ) were studied , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref . [ ] .",
    "there , it was found that the corresponding theory is a log - conformal theory .",
    "roughly , one can attribute the long - range log - conformal correlations to the @xmath0-symmetry spontaneously broken by a given composite instanton .",
    "interestingly , a quench must not necessary be across some - other - symmetry breaking phase transition in order to exhibit long - range correlations , _",
    "e.g. _ , barkhausen - like dynamics .",
    "it is also interesting that for quenches one can straightforwardly use bps observables that may provide certain topological invariants in topologically non - trivial theories .",
    "it is tempting to believe that so - calculated topological invariants may have something to do with the probabilities of the system to end up in one or the other competing stable configurations .",
    "in this paper , it is shown that the most general stochastic quantization procedure applied to any stochastic or deterministic continuous - time ( partial ) differential equations leads to a witten - type topological field theory - a theory with global topological supersymmetry .",
    "this topological symmetry must be perturbatively stable and consequently can be spontaneously broken only either on the mean - field level by , say , fractal invariant sets , or dynamically by the condensation of instantons and anti - instantons . according to this , we propose a generic phase diagram given in fig.([figure1]a ) .",
    "the mean - field level spontaneous @xmath0-breaking must be associated with chaotic behavior .",
    "the instanton - anti - instanton mediated breaking of topological symmetry corresponds to intermittency / soc - a full dimensional phase surrounding chaos .",
    "its full - dimensionality explains why algebraic correlations of soc dynamics are robust against moderate variation of the parameters of a system .",
    "full - dimensional intermittency / soc phase exists , however , only in stochastic models . in deterministic models , when anti - instantons disappear , intermittency / soc phase degenerates into the critical `` edge of chaos '' between deterministic chaos and deterministic markovian dynamics .",
    "according to goldstone theorem , both phases with spontaneously broken topological symmetry must exhibit long - range correlations .",
    "these correlations are related to such well - established concepts as self - similarity , sensitivity to initial conditions and/or non - markovian scale - free memory , power - law statistics of avalanches , algebraic power - spectrum in turbulence etc .",
    "accordingly , dynamical systems with unbroken topological symmetry can be called markovian in that sense that they do not exhibit long - range dynamical memory so one can always look at the system at such temporal scale that the dynamics will look effectively markovian .",
    "@xcite    the phase diagram and the interpretation of the physical essence of the three phases is the only result of this paper .",
    "there is certainly much more in the w - tft of dynamical systems to be understood in the future . in particular , in this paper we never used one of the most fascinating possibilities that w - tft s offer - the possibility to calculate certain topological invariants as expectation values of bps observables on instantons .",
    "one of the candidate ways to exploit these observables ( probably in combination with their anti - instantonic counterparts ) is in the form of order parameters for @xmath0-broken phases .",
    "in fact , a rigorous way for construction of effective field theories is one of the important advancements that w - tft may lead to .",
