    "one of the core tasks of modern hadron collider experiments is the understanding of the electro - weak symmetry breaking mechanism . in the standard model",
    "this can be explained through a simple higgs mechanism , where the additional complex scalar field acquires a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value , and leaves the theory with an additional scalar boson , the higgs boson , which should be experimentally detectable .",
    "many different channels are and will be exploited in order to either restrict the allowed higgs bosons mass range or , preferably , discover the higgs boson . in the range where the higgs boson is of a mass of about twice the w boson mass ( @xmath1 ) the branching ratio of the sm higgs boson in a pair of w bosons is almost one ,",
    "thus almost all produced higgs bosons decay via this channel .",
    "it has been shown that this channel , with both w bosons decaying leptonically , is the most promising discovery channel for a sm higgs boson in this mass range  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other decay modes ( e.g.  @xmath2 ) , the higgs invariant mass can not be reconstructed in the w boson decay mode , due to the non - detectable neutrinos in the final state .",
    "in addition the signal events are overlaid by background processes ( especially continuum w - pair and @xmath3 production ) with much larger cross - sections . in order to increase the signal over background ratio",
    "rather severe experimental cuts have to be applied .",
    "a discovery ( exclusion ) of a certain higgs mass hypothesis thus relies heavily on a precise knowledge of the expected number of higgs events and the corresponding final state observable distributions in this hypothesis after the application of such restricting phase - space cuts .    in this note",
    "we discuss the effects of higher - order qcd corrections on the @xmath4 cross - section at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) after the application of typical experimental cuts up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "additionally we compare the results from perturbative calculations at fixed order with the parton - shower monte carlo program @xmath5",
    "typical experimental event selections to enhance the signal to background ratio in the @xmath6 channel include cuts on lepton transverse momenta , missing transverse energy and the angle between the two charged final state leptons in the plane transverse to the beam - pipe .",
    "in addition events with hard hadronic activity in the final state are rejected ( jet - veto ) in order to reduce the otherwise overwhelming @xmath3  contamination .",
    "the set of cuts used in the presented work ( referred to as the _ signal cuts _ ) are described in detail in  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we discuss in some detail the higher order qcd effects up to nnlo on tow of these selection variables , i.e.  on the jet - veto ( @xmath7 ) and on the angular cut ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "effects on other selection variables are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "to study the effect of the higher order corrections we define the cumulative cross - section @xmath9 as @xmath10 with @xmath11 a specific selection variable .",
    "we can then quantify the higher order effects at ( n)nlo by computing the cumulative @xmath12-factor , defined as @xmath13      the first selection variable of interest is the jet veto . in its course events",
    "are rejected if there is any hadronic jet with a transverse momentum @xmath14  larger than the jet veto value @xmath7  in the central detector region @xmath15 .",

    "the nlo and the nnlo band overlap and the nnlo scale variation uncertainty becomes small , indicating a convergence of the perturbative series .",
    "the second selection variable we study is the angle between the charged leptons in the plane transverse to the beam - pipe .",
    "this variable is sensitive to the spin - structure of the initial state , and thus can serve to suppress the continuum ww background ( which at lowest order comes from quark - like initial states ) over the signal process ( which is dominated by gluon - like initial states ) . while in the signal process this angle is rather small , for the background processes the charged leptons tend to be back - to - back in the transverse plane .    in fig .",
