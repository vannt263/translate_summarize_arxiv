    "for example , the realization of quantum degenerate gases with large magnetic dipole moments @xcite , ongoing efforts to trap and cool polar molecules @xcite , experiments on rydberg atoms @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and atoms in high finesse optical cavities @xcite have opened up the possibility of realizing ultra - cold atomic systems with long - range interactions , such as the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction @xcite . concurrently , better control over experimental parameters and high resolution imaging techniques have introduced new probes for exploring many - body physics , notable among which is the ability to study the dynamics of correlations following a non - adiabatic ramp ( quench ) of system parameters @xcite . remarkably , these quench experiments provide a wealth of information about the low energy properties of the underlying system such as the nature of the excitations , and the manner in which correlations develop in a system .",

    "momentum distribution develops a peak at the wave - vector ( black arrow ) corresponding to the roton minimum in the inset .",

    "the existence of roton - like excitations generally implies that the system has a tendency towards developing crystalline order , and the softening of the roton mode is often a route towards realizing correlated states of matter such as supersolids and wigner crystals in bose and fermi systems @xcite . observing this mode",
    "therefore constitutes an essential first step towards the study of many body physics in dipolar systems .",
    "here we investigate how the roton mode is revealed in the spatio - temporal evolution of one and two - body correlation functions , following a sudden switching on of the dipolar interactions .",
    "our main result , summarized in fig",
    ".  [ nexkquench ] , shows that these correlations develop striking features that are directly related to the underlying roton minimum in the dispersion .",
    "this is because on timescales short compared to the collision time , excitations are coherent , and the momentum distribution develops oscillations at different @xmath7 , at a frequency equal to the energy of the excitation @xmath8 . as the roton excitations oscillate at nearly the same energy ( @xmath9 ) , a cooperative effect occurs whereby the amplitude of oscillations is enhanced .",
    "the momentum distribution , which is readily measured following time - of - flight , can therefore probe the roton gap .",
    "in addition to providing information about collective excitations @xcite , quench experiments raise fundamental questions about the non - equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems @xcite .",

    "recent work on trapped ion chains have provided evidence for the breakdown of the light - cone picture in systems with long range interactions @xcite .",
    "we show that for the continuum system , for weak dipolar interactions , correlations exhibit some features analogous to a light - cone .",
    "however the dynamics show marked deviations from light - cone evolution for strong dipolar interactions : correlations take longer to build up , and one can not associate a characteristic velocity with their spread .",
    "this is due to the oscillation of the system between a weakly interacting superfluid , and a correlated state with locally ordered domains .",

    "as the dipolar interaction strength is increased ( green , dotted curve in fig  [ nextplot ] ( top ) ) , the excited fraction develops undamped oscillations .",
    "this is due to the fact that for this interaction strength , the dispersion develops a broad flat shoulder ( see green ( dotted ) dispersion curve ) . as a result ,",
    "many modes oscillate at the same frequency , again giving rise to undamped oscillations in @xmath101 .",
    "this broad shoulder is the precursor to the roton minimum which appears for larger interaction strengths .    upon further increasing the dipolar interaction , ( equivalently @xmath82 ) the excited fraction shows pronounced ,",

    "furthermore , unlike phonon modes which occupy a range of momenta ( @xmath106 ) , all the roton modes have nearly the same energy ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath140 is experimentally tunable either by tuning the density or the axial trapping potential .",
    "based on our findings above , quench dynamics can probe details of the underlying _ equilibrium _ dispersion , even for strong quenches ( @xmath156 ) , provided that @xmath157 . despite the seemingly small value of this parameter ,",
    "this implies that the inter - particle spacing @xmath158 .",
    "these conditions can be readily achieved in experiments even for moderate densities ( @xmath159@xmath160 ) , for typical trapping potentials of @xmath161hz @xcite . on even longer timescales , beyond mean - field corrections such as collisions between quasi - particles , and between quasi - particles and condensate atoms (",
    "landau and beliaev damping @xcite ) , which are not captured by our self - consistent approach will endow the excitations with a finite lifetime ( @xmath162 ) , and drive the system towards thermal equilibrium . at low temperatures @xmath163 ,",
    "beliaev processes dominate , and their rates can be estimated perturbatively in powers of @xmath164 .",
    "for quasi-@xmath0d dipolar gases however , these rates are strongly suppressed for phonons and rotons , owing to the nature of the quasi-@xmath0d dispersion @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the relevance of our work to ongoing experiments on quasi-@xmath0d dipolar gases .",
    "experiments so far have not been able to decisively verify the existence of the roton mode , because the signatures of this mode in correlation functions are rather weak @xcite .",
    "here we have proposed the use of a sudden quench to amplify these signatures .",
    "the physical reason for this is clear : on short timescales , excitations coherent oscillate in and out of the condensate and the fact that roton excitations all oscillate with nearly the same frequency will lead to an amplification of the signal , similar to what occurs in driven fermi systems . in this respect ,",
    "the bosonic dipolar gas behaves like a fermionic system .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is its simplicity ; the momentum distribution following a quench can be readily measured in ultra - cold systems , and direct provides access to the roton gap , without the need for sophisticated spectroscopy .    using a time - depedent bogoliubov ansatz ,",
    "we have shown that this mode can indeed be identified following a quench , and the roton gap energy can be measured from simple time - of - flight measurements . to ensure that this is not an artifact of our approximations , we have presented a fully self - consistent theory , which allows the condensate density to fluctuate and identified the parameter regimes where",
    "the non - self consistent results are expected to be qualitatively and quantitatively accurate .",
    "we predict that provided the inter - particle spacing @xmath158 , the roton gap can be probed using a quench to within @xmath153 .",
    "while the quantitative magnitude of the effect we predict is contingent upon experimental realities , quench dynamics can complement other probes of excitations in dipolar gases @xcite .",
    "an important complication in most experiments is the presence of weak harmonic confinement . in a trap ,",
    "the low lying collective modes are density oscillations , which occur on frequencies proportional to @xmath165 , the radial trap frequency .",
    "the physics we describe here occurs on timescales @xmath166ms @xmath167ms . on timescales much shorter than the trap period",
    ", the overall condensate density profile ( which requires global mass transport ) is relatively unaffected , and a local density approximation can be used . using this approximation ,",
    "we have verified that numerically that the oscillations in @xmath101 persist for a few cycles in @xmath134 . on longer times , comparable to the trap period",
    ", collective density modes will wash out the oscillations in @xmath101 , and a better modeling of the condensate dynamics and the interaction between the condensed and non - condensed clouds is required . while such a theory can be performed , should experiments demand quantitative refinement , it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , owing to the separation of timescales between @xmath168 in typical experiments , the oscillations we find here should be observable , without complications arising from trap effects .",
    "furthermore , nearly homogeneous bose einstein condensates have been experimentally realized by using box shaped traps @xcite .",
    "in this work we have studied the non - equilibrium dynamics of a quasi-@xmath0d dipolar bose gas , following a sudden quench in the interaction strength .",
    "remarkably we find that quench dynamics can probe the excitation spectrum of the dipolar gas , which otherwise in equilibrium , displays _ no _ pronounced spectral signature of the underlying roton mode .",
    "physically , the reason for this is that on timescales @xmath169 , excitations coherently oscillate in and out of the condensate . as roton excitations all oscillate at nearly the same frequency @xmath170",
    ", this leads to a cooperative enhancement of the signal in correlation functions . in this respect ,",
    "our bosonic system displays an interesting parallel with a fermi gas with attractive interactions , where the quench to attractive interactions leads to an enhancement of the superconducting gap @xcite",
    ". it will be extremely interesting to study whether the _ non - equilibrium _ enhancement of rotons could be a route to realizing ( albeit metastable @xcite ) , quantum crystalline phases of matter .",
    "we hope that our work will not only motivate experiments to use quantum quenches to look for roton physics , but also further theoretical studies on the nature of spreading of correlations in dipolar systems .",
