    "a central issue in the thermal properties of heavy - fermion compounds is the discovery of a non - fermi liquid behavior in systems close to an antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "such a behavior has been discovered in a series of compounds containing cerium or uranium , for example , @xmath3 ( @xmath4=@xmath5 , @xmath6 ) @xcite , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite . in @xmath12 ,",
    "the specific heat @xmath13 depends on t as @xmath14 , the magnetic susceptibility as @xmath15 , and the t - dependent part of the resistivity as @xmath16 ( instead of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the fermi liquid state ) .",
    "most interestingly , the breakdown of the fermi liquid behavior can be tuned by alloying ( chemical pressure ) or by applying a hydrostatic pressure or a magnetic field .",
    "the origin of this nfl behavior is a problem of current debate .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed in order to elucidate the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) . on the one hand , there are scenarios involving strong disorder to account for the non - fermi liquid properties , including ( i ) a distribution of the kondo temperature @xmath19 @xcite induced by disorder following a distribution of the local density of states , and ( ii ) the possibility of the formation of a griffiths phase at the quantum critical point @xcite . on the other hand , starting from a clean or rather weakly disordered system , there is a scenario ( iii ) refering to the proximity of a quantum critical point in a theory of itinerant antiferromagnetism @xcite , in which the fermi surface is coupled to critical collective antiferromagnetic excitations .",
    "an alternative possibility has been recently put forward @xcite on the basis of an analysis of the neutron scattering measurements in @xmath12 .",
    "the unusual spin dynamics that has been observed suggests ( iv ) the existence of critically screened local magnetic excitations due to the formation of local moments .",
    "finally , it has been proposed ( v ) a variant of the quadropular kondo effect @xcite in which the interactions of the rare earth ( actinide ) internal degrees of freedom with the conduction electrons are reduced to a single impurity multichannel kondo effect .",
    "as it stands , the situation remains highly controversial .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the point of view ( iii ) of the proximity of a quantum critical point .",
    "the effect of a non zero temperature on quantum critical points is a long - standing problem encountered in itinerant magnetism .",
    "we refer to the papers of hertz @xcite and millis @xcite using renormalization group techniques , and of moriya @xcite introducing a self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of spin - fluctuations .",
    "these theories yield a rich phase diagram with , in addition to the ordering temperature @xmath20 , a series of crossover temperatures separating different regimes of behaviors .",
    "they are well adapted for the treatment of spin fluctuations as present in the single - band hubbard model but essentially do not account for the kondo effect .",
    "indeed , the model which is believed to describe the physics of heavy fermions is the kondo lattice model ( klm ) @xcite derived from the periodic anderson model ( pam ) in a given limit .",
    "the large @xmath21 expansions @xcite which have been carried out for these models ( where @xmath21 represents simultaneously the degeneracy of the conduction electrons and of the spin channels ) give a good description of the kondo effect .",
    "but , unlike the above - mentioned spin - fluctuation theories , they fail to account for the spin - fluctuations since the rkky interactions only appear at the order @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "hence our motivation to set up an approach of the @xmath0 kondo lattice model ( @xmath23 )  that enlarges the standard @xmath24expansion theories up on the spin - fluctuation effects .",
    "our previous paper @xcite , presented such an approach by performing a generalized hubbard - stratonovich transformation on the kondo interaction term of the hamiltonian which makes three types of fields ( magnetization densities and kondo - type ) appear on an equal footing .",
    "the dynamical spin susceptibility was derived in a one - loop expansion associated with the gaussian fluctuations of the magnetization density fields around their saddle - point values .    with the aim to describe the critical phenomena around the quantum critical point of the heavy - fermion systems",
    ", we propose to push the treatment of the @xmath0 kondo lattice model in a self - consistent one - loop approximation in complete analogy with the scr theory of spin fluctuations developed for the hubbard model @xcite . as in itinerant magnetism",
    ", we will show how the system displays a quantum - classical crossover at finite temperature depending whether the temperature is lower or higher than the characteristic energy - scale of the collective mode associated with the magnetic instability .",
    "the low temperature behavior in the different regimes essentially depends on the value of the dynamic exponent @xmath25 of the mode and on the dimensionality @xmath26 of the problem . in the case of an antiferromagnetic instability",
    ", @xmath25 is found to be equal to @xmath27 .",
    "heavy - fermion systems are usually believed to be three - dimensional . however",
    ", a recent proposal @xcite based on the neutron scattering data obtained in @xmath28 stipulates that the critical magnetic fluctuations which the quasiparticles are coupled to , are simply two - dimensional .",
    "so both situations @xmath29 and @xmath30 will be considered .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in part ii",
    ", we introduce the self - consistent one - loop approximation method for the kondo lattice model using a generalized hubbard - stratonovich transformation on the kondo interaction term .",
    "the approach combines both aspects of the @xmath24 expansion and of the self - consistent renormalization theory of spin fluctuations .",
    "the calculations , presented in the functional integral formalism , closely follow the presentation made by hertz and klenin @xcite for the hubbard model . in part",
    "iii , we extract the general expression of the dynamical spin susceptibility extending the results of the previous paper @xcite to a self - consistent treatment .",
    "part iv gives a discussion on the nature of the damped collective mode associated to the proximity of the magnetic transition with a dynamic exponent @xmath1 in the antiferromagnetic case . in part v , we derive the resulting quantum - classical crossover .",
    "this occurs at a finite temperature t , which depends on how the energy of the mode , on the scale of the magnetic correlation length @xmath31 compares to @xmath32 .",
    "the low temperature behavior of the system in the different regimes , separated by the crossover temperatures , is then discussed in part vi .",
    "concluding remarks follow in section vii .",

    "the saddle - point solution transposes to n=2 the large - n results obtained within the slave - boson mean - field theories ( sbmft ) .",
    "then we consider the self - consistent one - loop approximation beyond the saddle - point solution in the magnetically - disordered phase @xmath71 . following read and newns @xcite , we take advantage of the local u(1 ) gauge transformation of the lagrangian @xmath72 : @xmath73 ; @xmath74 ; @xmath75 .",
