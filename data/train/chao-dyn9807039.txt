    "the field of non - linear dynamics introduced the fascinating idea that an apparently random behavior of a time series might have been generated by a low dimensional deterministic system @xcite .",
    "based on the notions of chaos theory , different algorithms have been invented to infer if an observed time series is a realization of a chaotic system , e.g.  the estimation of the largest lyapunov - exponent @xcite , the correlation dimension @xcite and nonlinear prediction @xcite .",
    "there is hope to gain deeper insights in complex systems like those from biology and physiology by applying these methods .",
    "however , the application of these methods to a finite , often noisy set of measured data is not straightforward , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "for example , in order to claim a finite , fractal correlation dimension , a scaling region of sufficient length has to be established .",
    "determining this scaling region by eye or some algorithm may lead to an erroneous evidence of chaotic behavior . in order to evaluate the analysis ,",
    "it has become popular to apply the method of surrogate data @xcite .",
    "therefore , data are generated which have the same linear statistical properties as the original data but not the possible nonlinear ones .",
    "for many realizations of these data , the same algorithm as to the original data is applied . a significant difference between the distribution of the nonlinear feature for the surrogate data and",
    "the original data is taken as an indication that the process underlying the original data is deterministic @xcite , nonlinear @xcite or even chaotic @xcite .",
    "the explicit null hypotheses of surrogate data testing for linearity is that the data were generated by a linear , stochastic , gaussian stationary process , including a possible invertible nonlinear observation function .",
    "thus , a rejection of this hypothesis does not necessarily mean that the data come from a chaotic , i.e.  some kind of stationary , nonlinear deterministic , process .",
    "they might also originate from a nonlinear stochastic or even simply from a linear , stochastic , non - stationary process . in this paper , we investigate the power of surrogate data testing against non - stationarity . as nonlinear feature",
    "we use the correlation dimension .",
    "the behavior of correlation dimension estimates has been investigated for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 type of linear non - stationarity @xcite . for physiological data ,",
    "such @xmath2 behavior has been observed in heart rate @xcite .",
    "often , physiological data are characterized by some kind of oscillatory behavior like eeg , hormone secretion , breathing or tremor . for such data , types of non - stationarity introducing some time dependency of the oscillating dynamics ,",
    "e.g  a modulation of frequency or amplitude , seems to be a natural violation of the null hypothesis .    if the process is linear and the time dependency of the parameters , and thus , the autocovariance function is periodically in time , these processes are called cyclostationary @xcite . many other types of non - stationarity in oscillatory processes are imaginable .",
    "we choose cyclostationary processes because they allow in simple way for a parametric violation of the null hypothesis .",
    "formally , these processes can be expressed as higher dimensional autonomous non - linear stochastic processes .",
    "a special version of surrogate data testing acting on segments of the data has been suggested to analyze such data @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we informally discuss the class of cyclostationary processes and introduce the two specific examples we use in section iii to investigate the power of surrogate data testing with respect to these types of non - stationarity .",

    "( [ ar_process ] ) this means that the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 may change periodically .    as process satisfying the null hypothesis of surrogate data testing for linearity , we chose an autoregressive ( ar ) process of order two : x_t = a_1 x_t-1 + a_2 x_t-2 + _ t , _",

    "the canonical procedure to establish a finite correlation dimension is to show the existence of a scaling region for small @xmath40 where eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) holds and stays constant for a high enough embedding dimensions . for all processes investigated here , the true correlation dimension is infinity .",
    "following the idea of surrogate data testing , we fix an algorithm to obtain a finite value from the correlation integral and look for differences to the original data .",
    "therefore , we apply theiler and lookman s  rule of five  chord estimator @xcite and chose their @xmath41 equal to the standard deviation of the data . for such a large @xmath41",
    "we do not examine the small scale behavior of eq .",

    "we are aware that we should not call this quantity correlation dimension anymore .",

    "the surrogate data are produced by the fft algorithm @xcite .",
    "for each degree of violation of the null hypothesis 50 independent surrogate data sets of length 8192 were generated . denoting the `` correlation dimension '' of the original data by @xmath42 , the mean of the distribution of this feature for the surrogate data by @xmath43 and its the variance by @xmath44 , the result",
    "is displayed as : [ zet ] z= .",
    "it was confirmed that the distribution of the feature is sufficiently well described by a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , @xmath45 can be related to a confidence interval , since for 50 realizations the @xmath46-distribution of @xmath47 is well approximated by a gaussian distribution and @xmath48 corresponds to the 5 % level of significance .    in general , in power of the test investigations a procedure different from that outlined above is chosen . for a certain significance level , e.g.  5% , and different degrees of violation of the null hypothesis ,",
    "numerous realizations , e.g.  1000 , of the process are generated and the fraction of rejected null hypotheses is reported .",
    "due to the high computational burden for calculating the correlation integral , this procedure is not feasible here .",
    "the above procedure has the drawback that the results depend on the single realization that is used as basis for the surrogates .",

    "the distribution of these data are not gaussian for @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the amplitude adjusted surrogate data algorithm @xcite was applied .",

    "[ ar2_dat]b , the null hypothesis is clearly rejected at the 5% level of significance whenever the embedding dimension is large enough to reconstruct the second order process appropriately .",

    "thus , no amplitude adjustment was necessary .",
    "again , the distribution of the feature is sufficiently well described by a gaussian distribution .",

    "[ ar2_dat]c , leads to a clear rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5 % level of confidence .",
    "the simulation studies reported in this paper indicate that surrogate data testing for linear , stochastic , gaussian stationary processes is powerful against a violation of the assumption of stationarity .",
