    "the uv luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies is a key diagnostic for establishing the contributions of galaxies of different luminosities and masses to the cosmic star - formation rate ( sfr ) density .",
    "in addition , in combination with other measures , like the galaxy mass function , it also provides essential clues as to the causes for the slow down in star - formation of galaxies in more recent times since @xmath20 .",
    "the uv lf has been studied very extensively at redshifts @xmath21 , but at lower redshifts ( @xmath22 ) , similar deep , high resolution data has not been available . to date",
    "the @xmath23 uv lf has been measured from galex data using the dropout technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also using spectroscopic or photometric redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main limitations of the galex results are ( 1 ) the very wide point - spread function ( psf ; @xmath24  fwhm ) , which may cause blending of the uv light from several sources and makes the identification of optical counterparts relatively difficult , and ( 2 ) the limited depth ( @xmath25 mag ) .    with the installation of the wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ,",
    "the efficient coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum at high spatial resolution ( @xmath26015 ) has been extended to the uv and to the ir .",
    "the new ir capability allowed us ( and other groups ) to perform the first robust measurements of the uv lf at @xmath27 in the first - epoch data of the hudf09 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high sensitivity uv imaging capability provided by the wfc3/uvis channel similarly allows us to derive the uv lf at redshifts below @xmath13 , where the @xmath281500   uv flux from galaxies could not be probed efficiently with previous high resolution cameras .",
    "while the depth of the current ers wfc3/uvis uv data @xcite is less than that of the wfc3/ir data , the present depths still significantly exceed that from any previous uv data set .",
    "we use two different methods for our lf determinations : ( 1 ) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshifts to study galaxies in the range @xmath29 , and ( 2 ) the uv dropout technique , applied to the uvis filter set , which allows for the selection of star - forming galaxies at @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "the latter dropout samples are similar to the recent selections of @xcite .    in section [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe the data , the photometric redshift estimates and the dropout selection .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec : lf ] by our constraints on the uv lf between @xmath32 , and we end with a short discussion on the evolution of the uv lf parameters and luminosity density in section [ sec : discussion ] .    throughout this letter , we adopt @xmath33 kms@xmath34mpc@xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system @xcite .",
    "the early release science ( ers ) uv data cover a total of @xmath2850 arcmin@xmath1 of the goods - south fields @xcite in @xmath36 pointings of wfc3/uvis in three filters ( @xmath37  f225w , @xmath38 ",
    "f275w , @xmath39 ",
    "each pointing was covered with five orbits , equivalent to 2778  s , 5688  s , and 5688  s integrations in @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the observations in each band were split into three ( @xmath39 ) or four ( @xmath40 ) exposures to facilitate cosmic - ray ( and bad pixel ) removal ( see * ? ? ? * for more information on the data ) .",
    "the rms maps were scaled to the proper noise level , as measured in circular apertures appropriate for the galaxies under study .",
    "using circular apertures of 02 radius , the measured @xmath41 point source sensitivities in all three filters are 26.8 - 26.9 mag .    after masking areas with bad sampling and large residuals from cosmic ray",
    "hits the final area used in this study with both acs and wfc3/uvis coverage is @xmath42 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the reduced uvis images were registered to the goods acs b - band frames ( version 2 ; m. giavalisco and the goods team , 2010 , in preparation ) and drizzled to the same pixel scale of 003 . the most recent in - flight geometric distortion solutions ( 02/2010 ) were essential for obtaining good alignment .",
    "sources were detected in the acs b - band image using sextractor @xcite , resulting in 6683 detections down to 28 mag .",
    "colors were measured in dual image mode in isophotal apertures to maximize the s / n .",
    "lastly , our catalog was matched against the public goods catalogs and candidate stars flagged . at @xmath43 this identification",
    "is based upon their size ( half - light radii @xmath4409 ) and the sextractor stellarity parameter ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "faintward of 25.5 , the latter parameter is no longer reliable , and therefore flagging sources with half - light radii @xmath4409 was done if the @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 colors of sources were consistent with the stellar sequence ( within 0.15 mag ) . from a visual inspection of the sample of galaxies entering in the lf estimates this has proven to be a very efficient and complete procedure to identify stars .      in order to derive accurate photometric redshifts , we supplement the high resolution acs and wfc3/uvis data with ground - based ir and with spitzer data , using the goods - music catalog ( v2 ) of @xcite",
    ". in particular , the goods - music photometry used here is vimos @xmath48 , acs @xmath49 , isaac @xmath50 , and spitzer irac 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "the goods - music catalog is 90% complete down to @xmath51 mag . matching this catalog to our b - selected sources , we find 4165 matches ( using a 02 error tolerance ) .",
    "the uvis isophotal fluxes are scaled to total fluxes using the ratio of b - band iso flux to b - band auto flux .",
    "thus , our basic photometry catalog for photo-@xmath52 estimates consists of 7 filter hst data , complemented with 4 psf - matched ground based filters , and the two shortest wavelength irac bands .",
    "the irac 5.8 and 8.0 bands were omitted , since they are dominated by dust and pah emission for lower redshift galaxies . even if galaxies are generally red in @xmath53 , we limit our analysis to @xmath54 mag to avoid incompleteness corrections due to the @xmath55-band limit .",
    "we did not use the wfc3/ir photometry , since it is not available for all sources to keep our analysis as uniform as possible ( and our tests show that our selections do not change significantly when these data are included ) .",
    "photometric redshifts were estimated from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting with zebra @xcite .",
    "the adopted sed set is based on @xcite composite stellar populations .",
    "in particular , we computed 15 median templates as a function of rest - frame @xmath56 color for galaxies in the zcosmos survey @xcite .",
    "subsequently , these templates were corrected for systematic offsets with respect to the cosmos photometry @xcite using zebra , and the major emission lines ( ly@xmath57 , h@xmath57 , h@xmath58 , oii , and oiii ) were added using the @xcite relations between uv luminosity and emission line strengths .",
    "finally , dust was added to this set of templates using the @xcite dust law with @xmath59 , resulting in a final set of 2052 templates .",
    "we used this template set to derive photometric redshifts for our combined catalog of uvis and goods - music photometry .",
    "we compared our estimates with spectroscopic redshift measurements compiled in the goods - music catalog . from a total of 462 sources with reliable spectroscopy ( 363 at @xmath60 )",
    ", we find an accuracy of @xmath61 , with only @xmath62 of sources having redshift errors larger than @xmath63 .",
    "our photometric redshift estimates are therefore sufficiently precise to derive lfs in bins of @xmath64 .",
    "most of the uv lfs at @xmath65 are based on an lbg selection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the same technique can also be applied to the wfc3/uvis filters , allowing the selection of star - forming galaxies as uv dropouts . at @xmath66 ,",
    "the lyman break seen in galaxies is primarily the result of neutral hydrogen within the sources themselves , in significant contrast to the situation at @xmath65 , where the break is also due to lyman - series absorption from the igm .",
    "our selection criteria are based on standard color - color diagrams , which are shown in figure [ fig : colcol ] .",
    "in particular , the selection regions are chosen to identify an unbiased sample of star - forming galaxies with dust extinction less than @xmath67 guarding against lower redshift interlopers .",
    "specifically , the adopted selection criteria for @xmath37 dropouts are : @xmath68 this selects galaxies between @xmath69 , and results in 72 candidates down to @xmath70 .    similarly , for @xmath38-dropouts",
    ", the selection criteria are : @xmath71 selecting galaxies between @xmath72 , with 131 candidates down to @xmath73 .    and",
    "finally , @xmath39-dropouts are selected with : @xmath74 returning 434 sources down to @xmath75 with expected redshifts in the range @xmath76 . when applying these criteria , all fluxes below their @xmath77 limits ( in the dropout band ) are replaced with the respective @xmath77 upper limits .    for the @xmath39-dropouts , the stellar sequence runs exactly through the selection window ( see figure [ fig : colcol ] ) .",
    "however , stars are removed prior to candidate selection using the same identification scheme as for the photo-@xmath52 sample , resulting in a total of 40 excluded stars . from a final visual inspection of all sources",
    "no additional stars were found . a small number of clear diffraction spikes and spurious detections on the wings of large low - redshift galaxies were removed by hand .",
    "using our photometric redshifts , we estimate the low - redshift interloper fraction of these uv - dropout samples to be very small .",
    "in particular , only 7% of the sources in the @xmath39 dropout sample have @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , only 4% and 8% of the sources in our @xmath38- and @xmath37-dropout samples are interlopers , i.e. , have @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . only sources down to the limiting magnitudes of our uv lfs",
    "are considered in this estimate ( see section [ sec : uvdroplf ] ) .",
    "the uv luminosity functions at 1500    in the range @xmath29 are measured in three bins of photometric redshift of width @xmath4 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are computed from the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath81 photometry for sources in the redshift range @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "k - corrections are derived from the appropriate best - fit templates .",
    "the uv luminosity functions of galaxies are estimated using the standard @xmath85 estimator @xcite such that @xmath86 where the sum runs over all galaxies in the given redshift and absolute magnitude bin .",
    "we only include galaxies with @xmath87 detections in the corresponding filter , which results in the need for a completeness correction factor @xmath88 .",
    "following @xcite , this is determined from monte - carlo simulations in which we add artificial galaxies to the images and detect them with the same sextractor parameters as used for the original b - band catalog .",
    "the completeness is @xmath89 to @xmath90 mag in the uvis filters , after which it drops to 50% at 25.8 mag , which is our faint - end limit .",
    "figure [ fig : uvlf ] shows the resulting luminosity functions .",
    "the best - fit schechter parameters @xcite are tabulated in table [ tab : lfresults ] . while we sample the faint end rather well , with data that reaches @xmath91 mag fainter than @xmath92 , the relatively small area covered by the ers data results in some uncertainty on the cutoff at bright magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , our results are in good agreement with the lfs determined from galex by @xcite and effectively validate those results in data with @xmath0 times higher spatial resolution .",

    "the inserted galaxies are chosen to have a log - normal size distribution , using an extrapolation of the higher redshift lbg size scaling of @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the colors are set according to the @xmath13 uv continuum slopes derived in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with additional igm absorption according to @xcite .    due to the lower sensitivity of the uv data with respect to the optical , red colors across the continuum breaks can not be accurately measured for galaxies fainter than @xmath125 .",
