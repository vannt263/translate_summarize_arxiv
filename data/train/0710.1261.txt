    "quasi - elastic electron scattering on nuclei has represented during nearly three decades one of the most successful tools to study the nuclear and nucleon structure .",
    "experiments have been performed at slac @xcite , the mit bates laboratory @xcite , the saclay laboratory @xcite , and more recently at jlab in order to explore this reaction .",
    "both inclusive @xmath0 and exclusive ( single arm @xmath1 or double arm @xmath2 ) experiments contributed to a deeper understanding of the many - body structure of strongly interacting systems like light and heavier nuclei opening the possibility of investigating also the _ in - medium _ nucleon properties .",
    "inclusive @xmath0 scattering , where only the scattered electron is observed , provides information on a number of interesting nuclear properties like , e.g. , the nuclear fermi momentum @xcite , high - momentum components in nuclear wave functions @xcite , modifications of nucleon form factors in the nuclear medium @xcite , the scaling properties of the quasi - elastic response allow to study the reaction mechanism @xcite , and extrapolation of the quasi - elastic response to infinite nucleon number @xmath3 provides us with a very valuable observable of infinite nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however , experimental studies of inclusive and exclusive reactions induced by electrons are hampered in the case of target nuclei with a large number of protons by the strong coulomb field , which induces a distortion of the electron wave front , hereby modifying the structure of the @xmath0 cross section and inducing sizable effects in the longitudinal and transverse separation of the electromagnetic response @xcite .    still , there is a considerable theoretical and experimental interest in extracting longitudinal and transverse structure functions as a function of energy loss for fixed three momentum transfer for a range of nuclei .",
    "one of the important topics mentioned above concerning the in - medium modification of the nucleon form factors is related to the question whether the coulomb sume rule is violated in nuclei .",
    "this sum rule states that the number of protons in a nucleus can be obtained from an integral of the electric response of the nucleus over the full range of the electron energy loss at large three - momentum transfer @xcite . unfortunately , the conclusions reached by the large experimental programs carried out at bates , saclay and slac for a variety of nuclei ranged from a full saturation of the coulomb sum rule to its violation by @xmath4 .    the approval of the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) proposal e01 - 016 , entitled ` precision measurement of longitudinal and transverse response functions of quasi - elastic electron scattering in the momentum transfer range @xmath5 gev @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath8 gev ' , resulted in experiments performed very recently in hall a at tjnaf , using target nuclei like @xmath9he , @xmath10c , @xmath11fe , and @xmath12pb . in the present study ,",
    "we therefore focus on the particular case of @xmath13 scattering .",
    "preliminary calculations for @xmath14 show that the conclusions drawn below in the present study apply to heavy nuclei like @xmath11fe in an analogous manner as well .",
    "since the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) for electrons is no longer adequate for the calculation of scattering cross sections in the strong and long - range electrostatic field of highly charged nuclei , it has become clear in recent years that the correct treatment of the coulomb distortion of the electron wave function due to the electrostatic field of the nucleus is unavoidable if one aims at a consistent interpretation of experimental data . the theoretical framework to investigate coulomb corrections to the electron - nucleus cross sections",
    "is well established and is called distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) in contrast to the better known pwba where the incoming and outgoing charged leptons are described by ( dirac ) plane waves , neglecting the effect of the coulomb interaction between the projectile and the target nucleus .",
    "the application of the dwba scheme is in principle straightforward , but the numerical complications lead to extremely time consuming calculations .",
    "dwba calculations with exact dirac wave functions have been performed by kim _",
    "@xcite in the ohio group and udias _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for inclusive quasi - elastic scattering on heavy nuclei .",
    "however , these cumbersome calculations are difficult to control by people who were not directly involved in the development of the respective programs . early dwba calculations for @xmath10c and @xmath15ca were presented in @xcite .",
    "coulomb corrections have also been evaluated theoretically by a group from trento university @xcite , where it was found that the standard method ( used mainly in the case of light nuclei ) to handle coulomb distortions for elastic scattering in data analysis , the so - called effective momentum approximation ( ema ) , works with an accuracy better than @xmath16 for the description of coulomb distortion effects , if the energy of the scattered electrons and the momentum transfer is sufficiently high . on the other hand",
    ", the ohio group derived significant corrections beyond the ema .",
    "the findings presented in this paper confirm that the conclusions drawn by the trento group are basically correct .",
    "there is a certain mismatch between the ema and exact calculations for small energy transfer , which , however , strongly decreases when the energy transfer becomes significantly larger than the typical removal energy of the bound nucleons .",
    "calculations using an eikonal approximation ( called eikonal distorted wave born approximation , edwba ) for electrons have been performed by the basel group @xcite , which seemed to confirm the results of the ohio group . however , a poor approximation for the focusing of the electrons near the nucleus was used , leading to an overestimation of the coulomb corrected cross sections . through a subsequent analysis using exact electron wave functions we found that the eikonal approximation with an improved non - perturbative description of the electron wave function amplitude supports the observation that the ema is indeed a valid tool for the description of coulomb distortion effects @xcite .",
    "a similar preliminary result was obtained in @xcite , where exact solutions of the dirac equation were used for the electron wave functions .",
    "the nuclear current was modeled within the framework of a simplified single particle shell ( sps ) model , with harmonic oscillator wave functions for the bound nucleons and plane waves for the knocked - out nucleons . the cross section for inclusive quasi - elastic scattering process",
    "is usually calculated approximately by summing over all knock - out processes , where the individual bound nucleons inside the nucleus leave the nucleus after a sufficiently high energy transfer @xmath17 from the scattered electron , where @xmath18 is the initial and @xmath19 the final electron energy .",
    "the recoil nucleons move in an energy dependent optical potential .",
    "it is common practice that the imaginary part of the optical potential is not taken into account in the calculations , since the imaginary part is intended to describe the loss of nucleon flux inside the nuclear medium . in inclusive processes ,",
    "only the electrons are observed , and one may argue that it is not necessary to take into account whether or not the recoil nucleons actually leave the nucleus or initiate some subsequent nuclear reactions . still , it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath0 peak intensities are reduced by typically @xmath20% as a result of final state interaction ( fsi ) for the kinematics relevant for this paper , and how this reduction is related to the imaginary part of the final state nucleon optical potential ( see eq .",
    "( 29a ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of the fsi at high momentum transfer have been discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we present calculations based on two different models for the nuclear current .",
    "the final state nucleons are not described by wave functions obtained as solutions of the dirac equation with some nuclear model potential . instead",
    ", an eikonal approximation and the plane wave approximation are used , reducing the computational costs in a very effective way .",
    "it turns out that the use of approximate wave functions is not a weakness , since we find that at sufficiently high energies and momentum transfer , the effective momentum approximation provides an accurate description of coulomb corrections , irrespective of the nuclear model used .",
    "it is a fact that also elaborate nuclear current models , based , e.g. , on solutions of the dirac equation for the nucleons in some relativistic nuclear model , can not be considered as a fully satisfying strategy , as the still sizeable discrepancy between measured and calculated cross sections shows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "computational costs always restrain us from using more realistic nuclear models , where effects like nucleon correlations and meson exchange currents can be properly taken into account .",
    "the electrons are described by exact solutions of the dirac equation in our dwba calculations .",
    "inclusive @xmath0 cross sections are usually calculated by integrating over all final state nucleons in the knock - out @xmath1 cross sections obtained from a single - particle shell model @xcite for the bound protons and neutrons , as will be explained in further detail in the following section .",
    "the differential cross section for single nucleon knockout is given by @xcite @xmath21 @xmath22 with the matrix element @xmath23 , \\label{matrixelement}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the nucleon transition current obtained within the framework of some suitable nuclear model , the @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ crosssection ] ) indicates the sum ( average ) over final ( initial ) polarizations , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the energy of the initial and final nucleus , respectively .",
    "the virtuality of the exchanged photon is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the energy tranferred by the electron to the nuclear system . in our calculations ,",
    "the final nucleus was considered as a spectator , and the final energy @xmath30 of the nucleon was calculated from the energy transfer reduced by a reasonable separation ( or removal ) energy .    in the pwba ,",
    "the electron current is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are initial / final state plane wave electron spinors corresponding to the initial / final electron momentum @xmath33 and spin @xmath34 , normalized according to @xmath35 and a short calculation yields a three - dimensional integral @xmath36.\\ ] ] with the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath37 .",
    "in the dwba , exact solutions of the dirac equation for electrons in the electrostatic field of the nucleus are used instead of plane wave functions . in a general sense ,",
    "the ema accounts for the two effects of the coulomb distortion , namely the momentum enhancement of the electron near the attractive nucleus and the focusing of the electron wave function .",
    "therefore , transition amplitudes are calculated by replacing the asymptotic initial and final state momenta @xmath38 , @xmath39 of the electron by appropriate effective momenta in the pwba transition amplitude .",
    "additionally , the cross section obtained from the effective transition amplitude is multiplied by an appropriate focusing factor , which accounts for the fact that the electron wave function amplitude is enhanced in the vicinity of the nucleus , i.e. from a semiclassical point of view , the nucleus acts like a lens and concentrates the electrons towards the nuclear interior .",
    "indeed , one may establish a direct connection between the dwba and the ema .",
    "the dwba transition amplitude comprises the exact solution of the dirac equation for the electron in the electrostatic field of the nucleus . in this way , the dwba accounts for the exchange of the ` soft ' photons between electron and nucleus , whereas the explicit photon propagator in eq .",
    "( [ matrixelement ] ) accounts for the exchange of one hard photon .",
    "using the distributional identity @xmath40 one obtains @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 with @xmath44 denoting the transition charge and current densities of the electron and the nucleon , respectively .",
    "the double volume integral presents a clear numerical disadvantage of this expression . according to knoll @xcite",
    ", one may introduce the scalar operator @xmath45 such that the transition amplitude can be expanded in a more convenient form @xmath46 . \\label{wif}\\ ] ] the single integral is limited to the region of the nucleus , where the nuclear current is relevant",
    ". the expansion eq .",
    "( [ scalarop ] ) is an asymptotic one , in the sense that there is an optimum number ( depending on @xmath47 ) of terms that give the best approximation to the exact value .",
    "considering terms up to second order in the derivatives only one obtains @xmath48 e^{-i \\vec{q } \\vec{r } } \\rho_e(\\vec{r})\\ ] ] @xmath49 this approximation has been used in our calculations @xcite and in an equivalent way in @xcite , where it was also observed that higher order terms can indeed be neglected for the calculations relevant for this work .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the approximation has been applied for the first time to inclusive reactions in @xcite , and discussed in the context of the @xmath50 quasi - elastic reaction in @xcite .",
    "there is indeed a simple semiclassical interpretation of this expansion .",
    "if one assumes that the electron is scattered locally with a momentum transfer @xmath51 , calculable from the classical local momentum of the electron in the electrostatic potential and which deviates by @xmath52 from the the asymptotic momentum transfer @xmath53 , then one has @xmath54 @xmath55 furthermore , one may note that the pwba electron transition current can be written as @xmath56 applying the operator @xmath57 on @xmath58 leads to @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 acts as momentum transfer operator and replacing @xmath53 in ( [ classknoll ] ) by @xmath61 , one immediately obtains the differential operator part of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the knoll operator @xmath62 first factors out the undistorted @xmath63-term in the current , then calculates the ratio of the asymptotic momentum transfer with a quantity that can be interpreted as the local momentum transfer generated from the distorted electron current , and finally reinserts the @xmath64-behavior of the undistorted current .    assuming that one can approximate the effect of the @xmath62-operator by replacing it by an average ( effective ) momentum transfer @xmath65 , one obtains as a first approximation for the transition matrix element @xmath66 keeping in mind that the dwba electron current still has to be used in eq .",
    "( [ appro1 ] ) . since a highly relativistic particle ( with negligible mass @xmath67 ) is moving nearly on a straight line , the classical momentum of a particle with asymptotic momentum @xmath68 and energy @xmath69 moving inside a potential @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 .",
    "additionally , since the knockout process is nearly local for large momentum transfer ( e.g. , @xmath72 corresponds to a photon propagation length scale of @xmath73 which is much smaller than the extension of a heavy nucleus ) , and since it takes place in the entire volume of the nucleus , it is self - evident that one should calculate @xmath74 from a potential value @xmath75 which is obtained by an averaging process over the nuclear density profile @xmath76 @xmath77 with @xmath78 where @xmath79 can also be used for an approximate description of the charge density of the nucleus . in the case of a homogeneously charged sphere with radius @xmath80 and charge number @xmath81 , the electric potential in the center of the sphere",
    "is given by @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the fine structure constant ) , whereas the potential averaged over the volume of the sphere is given by @xmath84 .    a further approximation which can be made in eq .",
    "( [ appro1 ] ) stems from the observation that the attractive nucleus focuses the electron wave function in the nuclear region .",
    "it can be shown that for highly relativistic energies , the amplitude of the initial / final state electron wave function in the nuclear center is enhanced by a focusing factor @xmath85 , however , solving the dirac equation for an electron in the electrostatic field of a highly charged nucleus again shows that the focusing averaged over the nuclear volume is again well described by @xmath86 . since the electron transition current",
    "is given by @xmath87 , one may replace @xmath58 by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is calculated with plane electron waves with effective momenta .",
    "a detailed discussion of the focusing effect can be found in @xcite .",
    "if the same average potential value @xmath75 is used to calculate the effective momenta and the effective focusing factors , then a short calculation shows that the focusing factors cancel against the effective photon propagator @xmath90 in the cross section in the sense that @xmath91 and consequently , the ema cross section is calculated by replacing the electron current in ( [ approx ] ) by the pwba current calculated from the effective momenta , and leaving everything else unchanged . a different , but",
    "completely equivalent strategy is to calculate first the theoretical cross section based on the effective momenta and energies instead of the corresponding asymptotic values .",
    "the intermediate result obtained this way must be multiplied subsequently by @xmath92 in order to account for the focusing of the incident electron .",
    "the focusing of the final state electron is automatically taken into account by the artificially enhanced phase space factor @xmath93 .",
    "the cancellation mechanism that plays between the focusing effect and the the photon propagator in the matrix element is accidental and not really exact .",
    "it works in a very satisfactory way for nuclear charge distributions which are close to the homogeneous , spherical case . if the energy of the final state electron becomes significantly smaller than @xmath94 and the four - momentum transfer is below @xmath95 , the semiclassical picture on which the ema is based starts to fail . furthermore , for small energy transfer @xmath96 comparable to the removal energy of the nucleons , details of the nuclear structure and the interaction of the recoil nucleons with the nuclear matter become increasingly important , which makes the applicability of the ema questionable .",
    "however , this kinematical region is of minor interest in future experiments .",
    "as mentioned before , inclusive @xmath0 cross sections are commonly calculated by integrating over all final state nucleons in @xmath1 cross sections obtained from a single - particle shell ( sps ) model for the bound protons and neutrons .",
    "usually , the fact that there are short - range and tensor correlations between nucleon pairs which lead to a partial depletion of the single particle shells is ignored in sps @xmath0 calculations . within a correlated basis functions theory calculation , it was found in @xcite for nuclear matter that there is an approximate probability of 20% for a nucleon being in an correlated state @xcite .",
    "however , correlated nucleons account for approximately 37% of the average removal energy . in view of the fact that the average binding energy of , e.g. , protons is @xmath97 mev in our sps calculations",
    ", this observation implies that the correlated nucleons correspond to strongly bound particles with binding energies around @xmath98 mev , if an average removal energy of @xmath99 mev is assumed .",
    "the impact of correlated nucleons on the inclusive cross section is therefore strongly suppressed for an energy transfer clearly smaller than @xmath100 mev compared to the strength of the uncorrelated nucleons .",
    "still , a reduction of @xmath101% of the peak strength results from the suppression of correlated nucleons , combined with a slight shift of the peak towards higher energy transfer @xmath96 and an increase of strength in the high-@xmath96 tail .    a further observation , which is of minor importance concerning the present calculations , is the fact that the rms radius of uncorrelated nucleons tends to be slightly larger than the total rms radius of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "we therefore performed calculations within a strongly simplified framework , where the correlated ( high - momentum ) nucleons where described by model wave functions with a high - momentum component and large binding energies .",
    "we found that even in this case , the ema remains valid to an acceptable extent , if the ` correlated ' nucleons are distributed in a reasonable homogeneous manner inside the nucleus , and if the momentum transfer and final electron energy are sufficiently large . in this work ,",
    "we therefore focus on the main contribution of the uncorrelated nucleons in the region of the quasi - elastic peak , in order to facilitate a comparison to other works @xcite .    the relativistic form of the wave functions for bound protons and neutrons was constructed from the non - relativistic wave function .",
    "non - relativistic bound nucleon wave functions were generated using a self - consistent schrdinger solver for a non - relativistic woods - saxon potential and the additional coulomb potential for the protons .",
    "the woods - saxon potential , which included an ls coupling term , was optimized in such a way that the experimental binding energies of the upper proton shells and the rms of the nuclear charge distribution were reproduced correctly .",
    "the standard way to construct nucleon four - spinors @xmath102 from a schrdinger - type nucleon wave function @xmath103 was then applied , given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the differential momentum operator , @xmath106 is the energy of the nucleon , and @xmath107 is a normalization factor which is typically close to one .",
    "the same strategy , which is exact in the case of dirac plane waves , was also applied to construct the small component of the dirac spinor in the case of the nucleon eikonal approximation . for a discussion of this approximation",
    "we refer to @xcite .    the nuclear charge distribution , which is the main input for the calculation of the dirac electron wave functions , and nucleon optical potentials of heavy nuclei are often approximated by the help of a woods - saxon distribution . since the normalization and moments of woods - saxon distributions are rarely found in the literature , some important expressions are listed in appendix a.      in order to generate realistic nucleon wave functions in a computationally efficient way , we used eikonal wave functions for the final state protons and neutrons , with the aim to compare the ( coulomb corrected ) cross sections obtained from the eikonal nuclear model to the cross section obtained from simple nucleon plane wave calculations .",
    "this comparison will serve as a test whether the applicability of the ema is strongly dependent on the nuclear model or not .",
    "the eikonal phases @xmath108 generated by a potential @xmath109 take the local ( semiclassical ) momentum modification of the incoming / outgoing nucleon with initial / final asymptotic momentum @xmath110 approximately into account by modifying the plane waves describing the nucleons according to @xmath111 where @xmath112 or @xmath113 if the initial nucleon momentum is parallel to the @xmath114-axis .",

    "the imaginary part of the optical potential , which is intended to describe the loss of flux in proton ( neutron ) elastic scattering , has been neglected in our @xmath0 calculations . as mentioned in the introduction , in inclusive processes , only the electrons",
    "are observed , and the eventuality whether or not an ejected nucleons got ` lost ' , i.e. initiated some subsequent nuclear reaction , does not play a very important role .",
    "furthermore , the fsi affects the inclusive cross sections in a similar way whether the electron wave function distortion is taken into account or not , such that a comparison of electron pwba and dwba calculations is still possible .    to calculate the",
    "eikonal integral for a woods - saxon potential numerically would be relatively time consuming , and unfortunately , the eikonal integral of a woods - saxon potential is not suitable for simple analytic estimations @xcite . therefore , one may approximate the woods - saxon shape of the mean - field optical nucleon potential @xmath130 in an effective way by a power series in the distance from the nuclear center .",

    "a classical relativistic analysis of the particle trajectories shows that the central focusing is given by the expression @xmath177 which interpolates between the non - relativistic and relativistic regime @xcite .",
    "we additionally solved the dirac equation for dirac nucleons in the energy - dependent volume - central part of the optical potential used in this work for different energies , such that the amplitude of the eikonal phase corrected nucleon spinors could also be corrected by the corresponding energy - dependent amplitude modification .",

    "an overall phenomenological perrey factor @xcite ( correcting for the violation of unitarity in our simplified approach ) which applies in the same manner to the nucleon wave functions irrespective of the electron wave functions used , only leads to small corrections to the cross sections of the order of a few percent and has been neglected .",
    "however , even though the distorted nucleon wave function approach presented in @xcite is more ambitious than the present one , it is unable to reproduce the experimental data on a much higher level of precision , since it is still based on a sps model , which fails to account for many physical aspects of the inclusive scattering process .",
    "the relevant observation presented in this paper is the fact that coulomb corrections turn out to be compatible with the ema , with no strong dependence on the nuclear model used .",
    "it is clear that the same wave functions for the outgoing nucleon have to be used for the electron pwba and exact dwba calculations , since we are only interested in the role of the electronic part of the coulomb corrections .",

    "we note that the problematic ` staircase - like ' behavior of the saclay data , discussed in @xcite , has only a minor influence on the valuations presented above .",
    "the relative amplitudes and the peak shifts presented in @xcite do not exhibit the behavior expected from the discussion above in a distinct manner , even if one takes into account that a central potential value @xmath252 has been used in @xcite for the ema , whereas an average potential value @xmath253 has been used for our calculations presented in figs .",
    "especially , a pronounced enhancement of the dwba cross sections with respect to the ema cross sections in @xcite is absent in the present calculations , except for the case where the final state electron energy is specifically low , as shown in fig .",

    "however , from the physical point of view , one should argue that an effective potential value of @xmath257 is an optimal choice , if the energy transfer and the corresponding energy of the final state nucleons is high enough such that the impact of the final state interaction on the cross described by the optical potential becomes less important .",
    "the dwba cross sections are still larger by @xmath258 than the ema cross sections in this kinematical region , i.e. , a slight ` overfocusing ' can be observed .",
    "still , one should keep in mind that the accuracy of the present calculations is limited to a similar order of magnitude by the use of the expansion eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) .    for the @xmath259 kinematics ,",
    "the situation is similar , although the impact of the final state interaction described by the optical potential in the low energy transfer region to the left of the quasi - elastic peak is less pronounced .",
    "this is also due to the fact that a marginally larger effective potential of @xmath260 would be appropriate for this kinematics , leading to a better fit of the ema and dwba for higher energy transfer .",
    "furthermore , the quasi - elastic peak is also shifted to higher energy transfer compared to the @xmath241 kinematics , additionally reducing the influence of the optical potential .    as expected , in the case of the @xmath261 kinematics displayed in fig .",
    "[ cross_224_143 ] , the ema starts to fail .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "firstly , the energy of the final state electrons is relatively small , and the focusing effect becomes more important @xcite , such that the dwba cross section becomes significantly larger than the ema prediction .",
    "secondly , the quasi - elastic peak is shifted towards smaller energy transfer , where the optical potential increasingly distorts the wave functions of the final state nucleons .",
    "the momentum transfer squared is still relatively large , and is therefore not a contributing factor to the failure of the ema .",
    "note also that the shifts of the ema and dwba peaks with respect to the pwba peak are still of comparable size .",
    "again , in order to describe the dwba result within an ema framework , one could increase the effective potential to a higher value such that the ema and dwba curve match better in the region of large energy transfer .",
    "an other strategy would be to derive an optimized effective potential which shifts the maximum of the ema and dwba peak to the same position and to renormalize the ema curve by an appropriate factor subsequently .    as a general remark",
    ", one may observe that the coulomb corrections introduced within the framework of the asymptotic expansion eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) according to knoll depend on derivatives of the electron charge and current densities , or , by partial integration , on the nuclear four - current . since the corresponding nuclear response is rather smooth ( differently from elastic and transition form factors to discrete levels ) , and only leading terms in the expansion are relevant , one could expect that the dependence of coulomb effects on different models of the nuclear current is rather weak",
    ".    we finally comment on the electron eikonal calculations ( edwba ) presented in @xcite , which originally seemed to be compatible with the ohio group results in @xcite .",

    "a typical example from @xcite is displayed in fig .",
    "[ eiko143 ] , where also experimental data taken at saclay have been included @xcite .",

    "[ ratio_60 ] in this paper .",
    "the figure shows the ratio of the cross sections , calculated in pwba , with the coulomb corrected cross sections according to the edwba and ema .",
    "firstly , the ema curve has to be adapted to an effective potential of @xmath265 instead of @xmath269 .",
    "this slightly reduces the ratio @xmath270 and moves the corresponding dotted curve closer to one ( the horizontal line ) .",
    "secondly , the focusing factors of the edwba calculations must be corrected .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath271 and @xmath272 , the total focusing factor entering the edwba for the initial and final state electron originally used in @xcite corresponded approximately to the numerical value @xmath273 the correct total focusing factor should rather be @xmath274 accordingly , the edwba cross section has to be reduced by @xmath275 at @xmath276 and the corresponding solid curve moves upwards in the plot .",
    "the consequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio_60corr ] .",
    "note that for fig .",
    "[ ratio_60corr ] , also locally varying focusing factors obtained from exact solutions of the dirac equation were used in conjunction with the eikonal approximation for the phase of the electron wave functions . an attempt to calculate corrections to the focusing at some distance to the nuclear center",
    "has already been presented in @xcite , which , however , does not lead to reliable predictions in the important surface region of the nucleus and resulted in the overestimation of the focusing in @xcite . for the ema calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ ratio_60corr ] , a slightly smaller value @xmath268 than in the calculational example above was used , since this value has been determined experimentally to be @xmath277 for @xmath12pb @xcite by a comparison of inclusive electron and positron scattering data .",
    "this independent experimental finding is remarkable , since it also supports that an effective potential which is slightly smaller than the naive mean potential @xmath278 mev is adequate .",
    "one might speculate that the contribution of nucleons near the surface of the nucleus to inclusive scattering is enhanced , leading to the observed reduction of the effective potential .",
    "as a basic result of this work we conclude that the ema with an effective potential @xmath279 is a valid approximation for the description of coulomb distortions in the kinematic region where the momentum transfer squared is larger than @xmath95 ( such that the length scale of the exchanged photon is smaller than the typical size of a nucleus ) , the energy of the scattered electron is larger than @xmath94 ( such that the semiclassical description of the electron wave functions in the nuclear vicinity is valid ) and the energy transfer @xmath17 is larger than @xmath280 ( such that the distortion of the final state nucleon wave functions is moderate ) . in the case",
    "mentioned above , and for a typical energy range where the initial electron energy is of the order of some hundreds of mev , the dwba cross sections are generally larger by @xmath258 than the ema cross sections .",
    "if the energy transfer @xmath96 is smaller than @xmath281 , the dwba cross section can still be approximated by an ema calculation with a phenomenological effective potential @xmath282 and a minor amplitude correction .",
    "however , in such a case one has to rely on the model used to describe the nuclear current .",
    "other kinematic situations than those presented in this paper have been investigated , which showed that the behavior of the forward and backward scattering angle kinematics presented in this paper is typical .",
    "the coincidence of ema and dwba cross sections is rather impressive . as a test , the pwba and ema cross section calculations which are based on plane dirac waves for electrons were evaluated by both using dirac plane waves and by performing a limit @xmath283 in the full coulomb solver for the electron wave functions . performing such a limit in the dwba solver leads to the same cross sections as obtained from the plane wave calculations , such that the observed coincidence served as a numerical test for the two unrelated calculational techniques .",
    "it is instructive to compare fig .",
    "[ cross_485_60_ei ] in this work to fig . 16 in the classic work by rosenfelder on quasi - elastic electron scattering on nuclei @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that rosenfelder explicitly mentioned already in his work that the effective potential @xmath75 is close to the _ mean value _ of the electrostatic potential of the nucleus .",
    "however , he then wrote down the explicit expression for the _ central _ value @xmath284 of the potential of a homogeneously charged sphere with radius @xmath80 , which is related to the corresponding mean value by @xmath285 .",
    "this minor , but not irrelevant misapprehension for the case of the ema , has propagated in the literature since then ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the fact that the initial electron energy is marginally larger and the effective potential used by rosenfelder is given by @xmath286 , fig .",
    "16 in @xcite can directly be related to the result presented in fig .",
    "[ cross_485_60_ei ] .    despite many theoretical and experimental efforts to clarify to what extent a suppression of the coulomb sum rule exists , clear answers to the problem are still missing .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy between the results presented in this paper and the findings of the ohio group remains hitherto unclear , but one may speculate that it could be related to the relativistic nucleon potential model used by the ohio group , which may influence the resulting nuclear current ( spinor distortion or negative energy contributions ) in an unexpected way .",
    "an overview on different theoretical attempts to implement coulomb corrections in the analysis of experimental data can be found in @xcite . according to a reanalysis of experimental data based on the validity of the ema , which is supported by the present work , meziani and morgenstern claimed that a suppression of the longitudinal structure function of about @xmath287% exists at the effective momentum transfer of @xmath288 mev / c , and tried to explain the suppression by a change of the nucleon properties inside the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the fact that theoretical questions about the interpretation of relativistic nucleon potential models persist and further related effects like meson exchange currents and correlations have not been taken into account in a satisfactory manner in theoretical coulomb distortion calculations up to the present , and since the quality of experimental data may be questionable in some cases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is advisable to await for the expected experimental tjnaf results at the high momentum transfer region , in which the relevant correlations become small , whereas coulomb corrections become crucial to extract information about the structure functions and to understand the coulomb sum rule .",

    "<S> the influence of the coulomb distortion for quasi - elastic ( e , e ) scattering on highly charged nuclei is investigated in distorted wave born approximation for electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation is solved numerically in order to obtain exact electron continuum states in the electrostatic field generated by the charge distribution of an atomic nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> different approximate models are used to describe the nucleon current in order to show that , at high electron energies and energy - momentum transfer , the influence of coulomb distortions on ( e , e ) cross sections can be reliably described by the effective momentum approximation , irrespective of details concerning the description of the nuclear current .    quasi - elastic electron scattering , effective momentum approximation , nucleon form factors , coulomb corrections 0.2 cm 25.30.fj , 25.70.bc , 11.80.fv </S>"
