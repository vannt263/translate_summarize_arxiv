    "<S> the precision measurement of the mass of the @xmath0 boson is an important goal of the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> it requires accurate theoretical calculations which incorporate both higher - order qcd and electroweak corrections , and also provide an interface to parton - shower monte carlo programs which make it possible to realistically simulate experimental data . in this paper , we present a combination of the full @xmath1 electroweak corrections of wgrad2 , and the next - to - leading order qcd radiative corrections to @xmath2 production in hadronic collisions in a single event generator based on the powheg framework , which is able to interface with the parton - shower monte carlo programs pythia and herwig . using this new combined qcd+ew monte carlo program for @xmath0 production , </S>",
    "<S> we provide numerical results for total cross sections and kinematic distributions of relevance to the @xmath0 mass measurement at the tevatron and the lhc for the processes @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss the impact of ew corrections in the presence of qcd effects when including detector resolution effects . </S>"
