    "continuous variable quantum teleportation transfers unknown quantum states of a light field input from alice ( sender ) to bob ( receiver ) using squeezed state entanglement as a resource @xcite .",
    "since only finite squeezing is possible , the fidelity of this teleportation process is limited by non - maximal entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that the output of a single pure state teleportation always results in a pure state output conditioned by the classical information sent from alice to bob .",
    "therefore , it may be possible that bob can use this classical information to improve the fidelity if some information on the selection of possible input states is known .    in the continuous variable quantum teleportation experiment realized by furusawa et al .",
    "@xcite , the classical information is a complex field amplitude @xmath0 that is effectively added to the output field by a modulation process .",
    "the amplitude of this modulation process can be modified by a gain factor . in @xcite ,",
    "the input state was a coherent state with an amplitude much larger than one , such that the optimal fidelity was obtained at a gain of one .",
    "however , polkinghorne and ralph have pointed out that a lower gain can be useful for teleporting photon entanglement @xcite .",
    "such considerations demonstrate that the optimal gain for the teleportation depends on the selection of possible input states .    in the following",
    ", the dependence of fidelity on gain is investigated for coherent states , for the vacuum state , and for a one photon input .",
    "these results allow an optimization of fidelity for certain groups of input states , such as coherent states with constant amplitude and varying phase or qubits of zero or one photon .",
    "fig.[setup ] shows the schematic sets of the quantum teleportation used in @xcite .",
    "alice transmits an unknown quantum state @xmath1 to bob .",
    "alice and bob share epr beams in advance .",
    "the quantum state of the epr beams reads @xmath2 where r is the mode used by alice as a quantum reference in the joint measurement of a and r @xcite , and b is the output mode on bob s side .",
    "the degree of entanglement is given by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 varies from 0 to 1 , with @xmath4 for maximal entanglement and @xmath5 for no entanglement ( vacuum in r and b ) .",
    "experimentally , @xmath3 is determined by the squeezing achieved in the entangled modes . if the variance of the squeezed quadratures is reduced by a factor of @xmath6 , the entanglement is given by @xmath7 .",
    "alice mixes her input state with reference epr beam using a 50@xmath8 beam - splitter and performs an entanglement measurement of the complex field value @xmath9 , where @xmath10 as has been shown previously @xcite , the output state of the teleportation process can then be obtained by applying a transfer operator to the input , @xmath11 note that the output state is not normalized , since @xmath12 is the probability of obtaining the measurement result @xmath0 in the teleportation .    the transfer operator @xmath13 for variable gain @xmath14 can be expressed using photon number states @xmath15 and displacement operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 this operator can be now be applied to various input states . in the case of a coherent state",
    ", the output state is @xmath18 this output state is also a coherent state with an amplitude given by a gain dependent superposition of @xmath19 and @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , the gain factor affects the @xmath0 component of the output amplitude . in the case of vacuum input state ,",
    "the output state is @xmath20 the vacuum is simply a coherent state with @xmath21 , so the output state is a coherent state with an amplitude proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the input vacuum state can be recovered by choosing @xmath22 , effectively canceling the displacement @xcite . in the case of a one photon input state ,",
    "the output state is @xmath23 this output state is a displaced quantum superposition of a vacuum component and a one photon component .",
    "even though this is also a pure state conditioned by @xmath0 , it is not possible to recover the one photon input state by varying the gain .",
    "the success or failure of quantum teleportation can be characterized by the teleportation fidelity .",
    "it is defined by the overlap between the input state and the output state @xcite . using the results derived in the previous section ,",
    "we can obtain the gain factor dependence of teleportation fidelity for the different input states .",
    "the total fidelity is obtained by averaging over all @xmath0 , even though @xmath0 is accessible classical information and the output state is really a pure state conditioned by @xmath0 . in this sense ,",
    "gain tuning is a method to optimize the use of the information @xmath0 . in the case of a coherent state teleportation ,",
    "the fidelity is @xmath24 we note that maximal fidelity is always obtained at @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is optimal for @xmath27 .",
    "fig.([gfall]a ) shows the gain dependence of the teleportation fidelity for a coherent input state of amplitude @xmath28 at different values of the entanglement parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the peak of the gain dependent fidelity shifts to lower values of @xmath14 and gets lower and broader as the entanglement @xmath3 decreases .",
    "the peak is always at a gain value larger than @xmath22 , but lower than @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , gain tuning to @xmath25 can improve the teleportation fidelity for coherent input states .",
    "however , the fidelity remains below one for all @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the broadening of the peak indicates that the fidelity is less sensitive to gain tuning for low values of @xmath3 . in the special case of the vacuum state ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the fidelity is @xmath30 fig.([gfall]b ) shows the gain dependence of the teleportation fidelity of the vacuum state at several values of the entanglement parameter @xmath3 . as in the general case of coherent states , the peak of the gain dependent fidelity shifts to lower gain values and gets broader as the entanglement parameter @xmath3 decreases .",
    "however , the peak value of the fidelity is always one at @xmath22 .",
    "the vacuum state is always teleported successfully at @xmath22 because this case corresponds to a simple attenuation at a beam splitter with reflectivity @xmath31 @xcite .    in the case of a one photon state teleportation ,",
    "the fidelity is @xmath32 fig.([gfall]c ) shows the gain dependence of the teleportation fidelity of the one photon state at several values of the entanglement parameter @xmath3 .",
    "two peaks appear when @xmath29 .",
    "the second peak is a result of the phase space symmetry of the single photon input state .",
    "this can be understood most clearly at @xmath5 , where the output state is a coherent state @xmath33 and the overlap with the input photon number state is obviously equal for @xmath14 and @xmath34 .",
    "the right peak of the fig.([gfall]c ) changes in a similar way to the peak of the fig.([gfall]a ) for @xmath28 .",
    "once again the maximal fidelity is always found at @xmath25 .",
    "both peaks shift to lower gain values as the entanglement parameter @xmath3 decreases .",
    "the right peak also gets broader and lower with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "the peak position is always between @xmath22 and @xmath26 , with its lowest gain value at @xmath35 for @xmath5 .",
    "some additional gain is always necessary to replace the photon losses suffered at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "since the fidelity is always improved by lowering the gain below one , we conclude that an optimal gain condition @xmath25 can be found for any selection of states . in the following section",
    ", we apply this result to two examples .",
    "one possible selection of states to encode quantum information are coherent states with fixed amplitude and variable phase , @xmath36\\rangle$ ] .",
    "for example , information could be encoded in the states @xmath37,@xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "since the gain dependence of fidelity for coherent states does not depend on phase , the optimized gain is the same for all such states .",
    "it is therefore possible to determine the optimal gain directly from equation ( [ fidcoh ] ) .",
    "fig.[fidamp ] shows the gain @xmath14 dependence of the fidelity for input field intensities of @xmath41 for teleportation with an entanglement of @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ( vacuum input ) ,",
    "the peak value of the fidelity is one at @xmath44 .",
    "the input vacuum state is perfectly recovered by a gain tuning of @xmath44 . with the increase of the input field intensity @xmath45 ,",
    "the fidelity peak approaches 0.75 at @xmath26 . for @xmath46",
    "the input coherent state can not be recovered fully by gain tuning .",
    "nevertheless some improvement of the fidelity is always possible through gain tuning to an optimal gain value of @xmath47 .",
    "the optimal gain value is found by maximizing the fidelity .",
    "see the appendix for details of the calculation . for coherent states ,",
    "the optimization condition depends on the intensity of the input fields . in its most compact form",
    ", it reads @xmath48 figure [ optamp ] shows this relation between @xmath45 and @xmath49 for an entanglement of @xmath42 .",
    "the optimized gain @xmath49 varies from @xmath50 at @xmath43 to 1 for @xmath51 .",
    "the significance of gain tuning is already appreciable at @xmath52 , where a gain of @xmath53 is optimal , and it rapidly approaches the vacuum situation below intensities of @xmath54 . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the optimized gain is already as low as @xmath56 .",
    "the improvement of fidelity achieved by gain tuning at @xmath55 is shown in fig.[optfid ] .",
    "a substantial improvement of fidelity by gain tuning is observed for almost all entanglement values .",
    "the increase in fidelity achieved by gain tuning increases monotonously as the entanglement @xmath3 decreases , with a difference between the optimized and non - optimized fidelity greater than 0.09 for @xmath57 .",
    "the maximal increase in fidelity is obtained in the limit of no entanglement ( @xmath5 ) with @xmath58 .",
    "the fidelity for coherent state teleportation with known intensity can thus be significantly improved by an appropriate choice of the gain parameter @xmath59 .",
    "note that the short analysis of gain tuning given in @xcite for the experimental realization of continuous variable teleportation was only applied to the high intensity limit of @xmath51 .",
    "as mentioned above , the maximal fidelity is then found to be extremely close to @xmath26 . in this regime ,",
    "a very precise measurement is necessary to reveal the slight shift of @xmath49 due to the finite value of @xmath60 actually used in the experiment .",
    "another typical encoding scheme for quantum information uses the polarization states of single photons .",
    "continuous variable quantum teleportation can be applied to such photonic qubits by teleporting each of two orthogonal polarization modes in parallel @xcite . since successful",
    "teleportation requires that both the zero photon component and the one photon component of the qubit are teleported without changes to the quantum state , the total fidelity of the process can be written as a product of the two individual fidelities for vacuum and for single photon teleportation .",
    "as shown in appendix b , this is even true if the polarization of the qubit is unknown .",
    "since neither the homodyne detection nor the displacement is sensitive to the choice of polarization directions , the fidelity for a single photon of unknown polarization is always given by the joint fidelity @xmath61 .",
    "the gain dependence of this joint fidelity @xmath62 reads @xmath63 fig.[jointfid ] shows the gain dependence of this fidelity together with the fidelities for the vacuum and for the one photon teleportation at an entanglement of @xmath42 .",
    "the main peak of the joint fidelity curve is found between the maxima of the vacuum and the single photon fidelities . at @xmath42 , @xmath64 gives a maximal joint fidelity of 0.44 , compared with a fidelity of 0.35 at @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence of optimized gain on the entanglement parameter @xmath3 can be determined by analytically maximizing the fidelity .",
    "see the appendix for details of the calculation .",
    "fig.[jointgopt ] shows the optimized gain @xmath49 as a function of entanglement @xmath3 for both the photonic qubit and for a coherent state of intensity @xmath65 .",
    "note that both curves are very close to each other , suggesting that the gain tuning is quite similar for both single photons and coherent states with an average photon number of one . in the case of no entanglement at @xmath5 ,",
    "the optimized gain @xmath66 is 0.544 for the coherent state and 0.577 for the photonic qubit .",
    "it increases almost linearly to 1 as the entanglement @xmath3 is raised from 0 to 1 . as a rule of thumb",
    ", optimal gain tuning for the teleportation of photonic qubits is obtained at @xmath67 for practical purposes , this simplified relation should be sufficient to achieve improved fidelities for single photon teleportation .",
    "note also that a similar optimization would apply if the quantum information was encoded into vacuum or one photon states within a single mode .",
    "the improvement of fidelity by optimized gain tuning for photonic qubit teleportation can be obtained from @xmath66 using equation ( [ fidjoint ] ) .",

    "@xmath68 is obtained with the optimized gain @xmath66 , while for @xmath69 , the gain is fixed at @xmath26 .",
    "at @xmath5 , the optimized fidelity is 0.221 while the non - optimized fidelity is 0.125 . the difference of about 0.1 does not change much up to @xmath70 , so that an increase of 0.1 in fidelity is possible for most cases of photonic qubit teleportation . again , this value is similar to the improvement of fidelity achievable for coherent states with @xmath65 . however , the improvement for photonic qubits appears to be even more significant , given the relatively low total fidelity of this teleportation .",
    "the fidelity of continuous variable quantum teleportation can be enhanced by varying the gain in the measurement dependent modulation on the output field .",
    "we have shown that gain tuning always maximizes the fidelity at a gain value of @xmath25 .",

    "the optimal gain tuning for the teleportation of coherent states with known amplitude but unknown phase and for the teleportation of the polarization of a single photon qubit have been determined . for entanglement parameters of @xmath71 , improvements of about @xmath72 are possible in the fidelity of single photon teleportation .",
    "similar improvements are obtained for coherent states with intensity @xmath65 .",
    "these results demonstrate the usefulness of gain tuning for input states with a low average photon number .",
    "we would like to thank professor mio murao for helpful discussions .",
    "maximum fidelity for a coherent state teleportation is obtained at a gain @xmath49 which satisfies @xmath73 .",
    "the derivative of the fidelity given by equation ( [ fidcoh ] ) reads @xmath74 therefore , the optimized gain @xmath49 is given by the polynomial @xmath75 where @xmath76 the solution can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 we can obtain the optimized fidelity @xmath79 from this result and equation([fidcoh ] ) .    likewise , the optimal gain for the teleportation of a photonic qubit composed of a vacuum state and a single photon state is obtained by differentiating equation ( [ fidjoint ] ) , @xmath80 again , a polynomial for @xmath49 is obtained .",

    ", the experimentalist uses no information on the actual signal polarization s.    it is nevertheless possible to transform the calculation of fidelity into the s , p basis , where p is the polarization orthogonal to s. if the unitary transform @xmath91 rotates the polarization so that @xmath92 the fidelity for the teleportation of the @xmath93 polarized state can be written as @xmath94 it is now possible to apply the unitary transformations to @xmath95 .",
