    "ultrafast optical time resolved experiments performed on high-@xmath21 superconductors in recent years have shown that a substantial transient change of the optical transmission or reflection can be induced in these materials by ultrashort laser pulse photoexcitation ( pe ) .",
    "what makes these studies particularly interesting is the fact that in optimally doped superconductors where @xmath21 is a maximum , the amplitude of the observed photoinduced transmission signal , @xmath22 ( or reflection @xmath23 appears to increase dramatically below @xmath21@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recently it was found that in underdoped yba@xmath16cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath24 , the increase in amplitude could not be correlated with @xmath21 , but rather with the so - called  pseudogap  temperature @xmath25 which increases with increasing @xmath26@xcite .",
    "these observations together suggest rather strongly that the photoinduced effects are related to the opening of a gap ( or pseudogap ) in the density of states close to the fermi energy . for optimally doped cuprate superconductors - on which most experiments were done so far -",
    "there has been substantial agreement in the literature regarding the experimental data .",
    "however , various groups have proposed very different explanations for the observed effects@xciteand their origin have remained controversial@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a calculation of the photoinduced optical response in a superconductor for weak excitation and compare our results with systematic experimental data on yba@xmath16cu@xmath1o@xmath2 as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath4 .",
    "we derive expressions for the temperature dependence of the photoexcited quasiparticle density @xmath5 and photoinduced transmission amplitude @xmath14  for different possible gaps ( or pseudogaps ) which might be applicable to high-@xmath21 cuprates .",
    "the simplest case considered is that of a gap , whose temperature dependence is mean - field like and is approximated using a bcs function .",
    "the second case considered is for a temperature - independent  pseudogap  which is relevant for a superconductor where condensation of pre - formed pairs into a superconducting state occurs at @xmath21 but pairing takes place above this temperature . in this case",
    "the gap is not _  _ due to a collective effect , but essentially represents the pair binding energy @xmath27 and is - to first approximation - temperature independent .",
    "finally we discuss the case of an anisotropic gap with nodes , such as one might expect for a @xmath13-wave superconductor . in section v we present a calculation of the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle relaxation rate @xmath7 .",
    "comparisons of the theoretical predictions with experimental data are made in each case and a detailed discussion is given in section vi .",
    "the time - resolved experiments were performed using 100 fs , 800 nm pulses from a ti : sapphire laser using single high frequency modulation of the pump at 200 khz .",
    "the yba@xmath16cu@xmath1o@xmath2 thin film samples were grown on mgo or srtio@xmath1 substrates and annealed in oxygen to obtain different o concentrations @xmath28 the @xmath21 was measured by measuring the ac susceptibility in each case .",
    "the transition widths , defined as the temperature where @xmath29 drops to 90% of full diamagnetism , were typically 1 - 2 k for the @xmath30 0.15 and 4 - 7 k for @xmath31 0.15 .",
    "the oxygen concentration was determined from @xmath21 , which brings in some uncertainty near optimum doping , since the optimum @xmath21 for ybco is 90 k on srtio@xmath32 substrates and 89 k on mgo substrates , which is 2 - 3 k lower than in single crystals .",
    "the typical film thicknesses were 100 - 120 nm and all experiments were performed in transmission through the sample .",
    "the typical energy of the laser pulse is 0.2 nj , and the laser spot size typically 100@xmath33 m in diameter . in estimating the carrier density ,",
    "the absorption length was assumed to be @xmath34 @xmath35 m .",
    "the cw  temperature rise of the superconductor film due to laser heating was calibrated using a 30@xmath36 ybco superconducting microbridge from the same batch and on the same substrate as in the optical experiments by measuring the change in resistivity with a 4-probe contact method .",
    "this temperature offset was then taken into account in the plots shown in figures 1 - 6 .",
    "the error in the sample temperature is thus reduced to less than @xmath372 k.    the photoinduced transmission @xmath6  through two different films with @xmath38 and 53 k respectively is shown in fig . 1 at different temperatures above and below @xmath21 .",
    "there are two decay components in each case , a fast component with @xmath39ps , and a longer - lived component with @xmath40 ns , which appears as a nearly flat background already discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the latter will not be analysed here , except that it will be taken into account in the fitting procedure .",
    "the time - evolution of the traces was fitted ( shown by the solid lines in fig.1 ) using a model with a _",
    "single _ exponential decay and a gaussian temporal profile pump pulse , from which the amplitude of the photoinduced transmission , @xmath41and relaxation time of the fast component , @xmath42 was determined .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath43and @xmath7 derived from the fits are plotted in figs . 2 , 4 and 5 and",
    "will be discussed together with the theory in the following sections .",
    "the initial phase of pe  carrier relaxation after absorption of a pump laser photon proceeds very rapidly .",
    "after the laser pulse excites an electron - hole pair , these pe  carriers thermalize among themselves with a characteristic time of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the carrier energy measured from  the fermi energy @xmath46 . in this thermalization process ,",
    "quasiparticle avalanche multiplication due to electron - electron collisions takes place as long as @xmath47 is less than the electron - phonon ( _ e - ph _ ) relaxation time @xmath48 .",

    "in discussing the theoretical explanation for the observed effects , it is important to make the distinction between experiments _ ( i ) _ in which the photoexcited charge carrier density is substantially less than the normal state carrier density , @xmath5 @xmath95 so the laser makes only a weak perturbation on the superconductor@xcite and _ ( ii ) _ those where @xmath96 and photoexcitation is sufficiently strong to close the superconducting gap@xcite .",

    "to end this section we briefly make a quantitative comparison of the relaxation rates for a gapped and gapless material . comparing the relaxation time for the case of a gapped material with relaxation time in a normal metal described by allen s formula@xcite we obtain : @xmath243 inserting experimental values for @xmath244 and @xmath211 we find the anharmonic phonon decay time in a superconductor to be approximately two orders of magnitude _ slower _ than electron - phonon relaxation in a gapless material as @xmath245 for @xmath246 as expected .",
    "the calculation was performed assuming that the rate limiting step for qp relaxation is anharmonic decay of high - energy phonons , while direct electron phonon relaxation was assumed to be small .",
    "this is now justified quantitatively by a calculation of the direct electron - phonon relaxation rate .",
    "the contribution of phonon - electron scattering to the relaxation of phonon system can be estimated by deriving the corresponding relaxation rate @xmath247 using the usual electron - phonon collision integral ( see appendix ) : @xmath248 we see that the electron - phonon relaxation rate , when compared to the phonon relaxation rate is reduced by the factor @xmath249 : @xmath250 and can therefore be neglected .",
    "however if the number of phonon modes involved in the relaxation is significantly smaller , the ratio @xmath251 may approach unity . in this case",
    "the electron - phonon collisions can also contribute to the phonon relaxation .",
    "however the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate @xmath252 is very similar to the anharmonic relaxation @xmath218 , both being proportional to @xmath253 ) and so the two contributions to the relaxation may be difficult to separate experimentally . the data shown in figure 5 are fit to @xmath254 without any fitting parameters , so it appears to be reasonable to assume that anharmonic relaxation  described by eqs .",

    "( 6 ) ) . the relatively square shape of the temperature dependence of @xmath14 , the weak maximum near @xmath255 and the rapid drop in the signal amplitude above this temperature is a consequence of the particular temperature dependence of the gap with the property that @xmath256 as @xmath257 . in underdoped ybco on the other hand ( fig .",

    "the divergence at @xmath258 shown in figure 5 for samples near optimum doping together with the temperature dependence of @xmath43 lead to the inescapable conclusion that there is a gap in yba@xmath16cu@xmath1o@xmath259 with @xmath260 which closes rapidly at @xmath21 . on the other hand , the notable _ absence  _ of this divergence of @xmath7 for underdoped yba@xmath16cu@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "@xmath261@xcite is consistent with the existence of a @xmath4-independent gap deduced from the temperature dependence of @xmath43 .",
    "plotting the temperature @xmath146 and @xmath21 as a function of @xmath18 in figure 6 , we find that @xmath146 drops with increasing doping in a characteristic fashion , following the so - called  pseudogap  behaviour reported by other experimental techniques@xcite . near optimum doping , the  pseudogap  becomes observable close to @xmath21 .",
    "such a situation occurs in bcs  superconductors where gap formation is a collective effect and cooper pairs form simultaneously with the formation of a phase coherent collective state at @xmath21 .",
    "however , from figure 2c ) and figure 3 there is some evidence of remaining qp  excitations above @xmath21 even near @xmath262 the @xmath4-independent  pseudogap  thus appears to be still present near optimum doping , and the bcs case is not quite realized .",
    "the underdoped state is distinctly different , with a @xmath4-independent normal state pseudogap appearing at @xmath263 .",
    "the changes in the photoinduced transmission @xmath43 at @xmath146 in this case are simply a result of an increase population of pairs with decreasing temperature .",
    "since the observed changes in @xmath264 are associated only with pairing and not phase coherence ( which occurs at @xmath265 we see no change in @xmath264 at @xmath21 in agreement with predictions of pre - formed pairing models of the underdoped state@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap in this case signifies the pair binding energy , and its value is determined by the microscopic pairing mechanism .",
    "it is to first approximation temperature independent and decreases with an inverse law with increasing carrier concentration , which is consistent with increased semi - classical ( debye - hckel ) screening between charge carriers @xcite .",
    "since the temperature dependence of @xmath14 is actually exponential at high temperatures ( eq.4 ) , it is more appropriate to discuss the doping dependence of the magnitude of the energy gap @xmath266 rather than of @xmath267 this avoids the somewhat arbitrary criterion for determining @xmath146 of an asymptotic function .",
    "such a plot of @xmath266 versus doping @xmath18 is shown in figure 7 .",
    "as predicted on the basis of screening arguments above , @xmath108 appears to follow an inverse law @xmath268 where @xmath269 is proportional to the carrier concentration .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath108 can be independently confirmed from the same data set by plotting the low - temperature value of @xmath139  as a function of @xmath28 as can be seen from the formulae ( 4,6 ) , the value of @xmath270 at @xmath271 is proportional to @xmath272 from which the zero - temperature gap @xmath273 can be determined . a scaled plot of @xmath274 @xmath275 as a function of doping @xmath18 in figure 7 independently confirms the inverse relation @xmath276 .",
    "we note that the observation of an inverse law is in agreement with recent experiments on la@xmath277sr@xmath278cuo@xmath279@xcite , @xcite suggesting that it may be a universal feature of the cuprates .",
    "a somewhat surprising feature of the data is that they are described  so well by an isotropic gap over the whole range of doping .",
    "a @xmath13-wave gap is apparently not consistent with either the temperature dependence of @xmath264 or the linear intensity dependence of @xmath280 it is also not consistent with the observation of a single exponential decay of @xmath281  with time , since in the @xmath13-wave case we would expect a distribution of @xmath7s , and certainly no single divergence of @xmath282 at @xmath21 should be observed in the @xmath13-wave case .",
    "a possible explanation for the absence of a @xmath13-wave signature is that in ybco the gap in the bulk of the sample is more or less isotropic in contrast to the surface , where it may be more @xmath13-like@xcite .",
    "another possibility for the apparent discrepancy between the present optical data and , for example , raman experiments@xcite are the different weights that the matrix elements have in the probing process . in the present experiments the dipole transition matrix elements average over the whole fermi surface ( fs ) weighted by areas of large electron momentum .",
    "anisotropy of the fs is not emphasized in this case .",
    "this is different than in raman measurements , where the electronic scattering intensity is zero for an isotropic parabolic band , and raman intensity comes only from the anisotropic regions of the fs .",
    "we conclude by noting that the comparison of the theoretically predicted temperature dependence of the photoinduced absorption signal amplitude _ and _ relaxation time @xmath7 with the experimental results on underdoped and optimally doped yba@xmath16cu@xmath1o@xmath2 gives good _ quantitative _ agreement .",
    "the evolution of the gap from a temperature - independent @xmath283 to a temperature - dependent collective gap @xmath284 is a particularly striking feature of the data as is the apparent inverse dependence of the gap magnitude with doping .",
    "although the model calculation presented in this paper was performed with the superconducting cuprates in mind , it is quite general and can , for example , also be applied to a case of photoexcitation experiments on cdw systems or narrow gap semiconductors .",
