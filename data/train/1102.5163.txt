    "accidental degeneracy has been an interesting issue in mathematical physics , with the classic examples ranging from non - relativistic hydrogen atom to multi - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the fact that states labeled by different quantum numbers share the same energy is explained by identifying hidden constants of motion , unrelated to spatial symmetries that may be present in the problem . in hydrogen atom , for example , these are the three runge - lenz - pauli operators which , together with the usual angular momentum , constitute a closed @xmath1 lie algebra , and so imply the degeneracy among all the levels of a given principle quantum number.@xcite for the hydrogen spectra in the relativistic limit , however , the linear dispersion in the dirac hamiltonian together with its matrix structure complicate the degeneracy pattern and hinder the search for the hidden accidental constants of motion.@xcite    recently , the interface between topologically trivial and non - trivial insulator has become a topic of many investigations , because of its hosting of the quasi - relativistic chiral dirac fermions.@xcite depositing a type - ii superconductor onto the surface of a topological insulator , for example , could by the proximity effect induce a mass - term for the dirac fermions , proportional to the superconducting order parameter.@xcite it is well known that , in general , in the vortex configuration of such a mass - term , there exists a special topologically protected state in the dirac spectrum at zero energy.@xcite many authors have recently elaborated on the properties of such zero - modes in condensed matter systems , and derived several unexpected consequences of their existence.@xcite    obtaining the entire bound spectrum for a general vortex profile @xmath2 , however , is typically not possible analytically , and one has to resort to numerical methods .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the corresponding dirac hamiltonian becomes analytically solvable once the amplitude of the vortex is linearized near the origin.@xcite in our previous paper,@xcite we showed that due to the presence of a closed clifford algebra associated with dirac matrices the energy spectrum even in this ",
    "harmonic approximation \" is non - trivial , and , in particular , exhibits degeneracies due to the hidden and accidental @xmath0 and supersymmetries .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath3 , with an energy scale @xmath4 , and with integer @xmath5 corresponding to the total number of fictitious fermions and bosons that can be formally defined in the problem , and then distributed over two ( in two dimensions ) quantum states in all possible ways .",
    "the associated degeneracy then comes out to be @xmath6 , and when @xmath7 there are two distinct multiplets of the effective  angular momentum \" , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , reminiscent of the nonrelativistic spectrum of the hydrogen atom.@xcite such a bound - state spectrum could be observable by the scanning tunneling microscopy , and would determine the specific heat of the vortex , for example .    in this paper , we investigate further the properties and the algebra of the supersymmetry generators , which are responsible for the degeneracy between different multiplets of the angular momentum .",
    "these generators commute with the square of the dirac vortex hamiltonian , and their emergence in the problem is closely related to the existence of different square roots of the identity matrix .",
    "we also establish a partial analogy with the runge - lenz - pauli vector for the text - book hydrogen atom.@xcite besides its relevance to topological insulators , our study is also pertinent to the insulating or superconducting graphene , where the low - energy excitations are also dirac fermions , and the mass - gap can in principle be generated dynamically , as well as externally .@xcite    in addition to the usual symmetry of the dirac spectrum around zero energy , the chiral symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian is also responsible for the appearance of the linear combination of odd and even occupation numbers of the fictitious fermions in the bound - state wave functions .",
    "we use this property to investigate the symmetry breaking effects of the chemical potential and the zeeman magnetic field , which in reality are present both in graphene and in topological insulators .",
    "we find that the degeneracy is completely lifted in general , but some residual degeneracy remains in the special case when the two contributions are equal in strength .",
    "the paper has the following organization . in sec .",
    "[ susy ] , the supersymmetry generators and their superalgebra are introduced in terms of the associated supercharge .",
    "[ matrix ] is devoted to explicitly constructing these symmetry generators . a comparison with the runge - lenz - pauli vector is also provided .",
    "the effects of the finite chemical potential and the zeeman field , and their connection with the chiral operator are investigated in sec .",
    "[ mueffect ] .",
    "finally , the discussion of validity of the linear approximation made for the vortex amplitude , and comments on related problems in the literature are offered in sec .",
    "[ discon ] .",
    "some explicit wave functions are exhibited in sec .",
    "[ appendix ] .",
    "we define the vortex configuration    ( ) = |(r)| ( , ) in the two - component order parameter @xmath11 , which when uniform provides a mass - gap for the two - dimensional dirac fermions .",
    "such an order parameter may in principle arise from the proximity - induced superconductivity in both graphene and topological insulator , for example .",
    "@xmath12 are the usual polar coordinates in the plane . the winding number of the vortex is assumed to be unity .",
    "the spatial profile of the the order parameter s amplitude will be taken to be qualitatively similar to the simple @xmath13 , which features the generic linear dependence on the radial coordinate near the origin and the saturation to a finite value @xmath14 at infinity .",
    "@xmath15 is the characteristic ( coherence ) length .    with the above qualifications in mind , the linearized dirac hamiltonian with the mass - vortex",
    "may be written as h = c(_1 p_1+_2p_2)+(_1x_1+_2x_2),[generich ] where the set of four @xmath16 hermitian matrix @xmath17 , @xmath18 , constitutes the 4-dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "the fifth matrix @xmath19 is responsible for the chiral symmetry , since it evidently _ anticommutes _ with the hamiltonian : @xmath20 .    a supersymmetric representation of the dirac hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ generich ] ) is possible both because of the existence of the standard bosonic representation for the operators of coordinates and momenta ,    b_i = x_i + ip_i , and of the fermionic representation for the _ four _ dirac matrices,@xcite a_i=. here @xmath21 = \\ { a_i , a^\\dagger _",

    "the two transformations together yield the following supersymmetric hamiltonian ,    h=(a^_1b_1+a^_2b_2 + a_1b^_1+a_2b^_2),[h0 ] where the energy @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath4 will be assumed to be unity , and will not be shown explicitly unless needed .",
    "the energy eigenvalues in this representation become obvious , because h^2=_i=1,2(a^_ia_i+b^_ib_i ) , turns out to be a simple sum of fermion and boson particle numbers .",
    "therefore , the energy levels can be labeled by the total particle number @xmath5 , and various ways of distributing these fictitious particles according to their statistics leads to the degeneracy of @xmath6.@xcite it is also easy to see that the zero - mode in this representation corresponds to the nondegenerate vacuum @xmath24 , which is also an eigenstate of the chiral symmetry operator @xmath25 with the eigenvalue of unity .    in order to see how the underlying supersymmetry emerges",
    ", we first note the commutators @xmath26=a^{\\dag}_i$ ] and @xmath27=b^{\\dag}_i$ ] for @xmath18 .",
    "we then search for other operators whose square has the identical commutation relations with the particle operators . with the help of identity @xmath28=\\{a,[a , x]\\}=[a,\\{a , x\\}]$ ] for either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , one readily finds the following three such additional supersymmetry operators : a_i=_j , k=1,2 _ i , jk(a^_jb_k + b^_ja_k ) , [ veca ] which satisfy @xmath31 ( without the summation convention ) . in the above",
    ", the index @xmath32 denotes the i - th pauli matrix , whereas the subscripts @xmath33 label the matrix elements .",
    "the existence of these operators is linked to the fact that the two - by - two identity matrix @xmath34 has four distinct square roots .",
    "together with @xmath35 , the four supersymmetry operators may be decomposed into the supercharges and their hermitian conjugates,@xcite @xmath36 .",
    "the time - component @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath35 and the rest of components refers to @xmath38 .",
    "the supercharge is defined as q_= _ j , k=1,2 b^_j(_)_jka_k .",
    "we now determine the algebra satisfied by the supersymmetry operators .",
    "first , due to the quantum statistics associated with the @xmath39 s and @xmath40 s , the supercharges are mutually anticommuting : \\{q_,q_}=0 .",
    "next , it is useful to invoke the anticommutator    \\{a^_ib_j , b^_la_m}=a^_ia_m_jl + b^_lb_j_im,[basic0 ] between boson - fermion mixed operators to compute the anticommutators between @xmath41 s and @xmath42 s ,    \\{q_,q^_}=_j , k=1,2 ( b^_j(__)_jkb_k + a^_j(__)_jka_k ) , [ basici ] which will be crucial in the subsequent generation of the constants of motion .",
    "( [ basici ] ) leads to the following simple superalgebra for the components of the operator @xmath38 :    \\{a_i , a_j}=2h^2_ij.[s3 ] when the time - component @xmath35 is involved in eq.([basici ] ) , on the other hand , one obtains the generators of the @xmath0 symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian as    \\{h,}=4[s4 ] , defined as,@xcite    j_i=_j , k=1,2 _ i , jk(a^_ja_k + b^_jb_k).[vecj ] from eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) and ( [ s4 ] ) , we then see that @xmath43 is a constant of motion , since = [ \\{h , a_i},h]=0 .",
    "next , the algebra between @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s may be displayed in terms of commutators , which also make the vector nature of the latter under the @xmath0 symmetry manifest .",
    "the following identity ,    [ x^_ix_j , x^_lx_m]=x^_ix_m_jl -x^_lx_j_im,[basicii ] for both fermion @xmath46 and boson @xmath47 can be used to derive the standard @xmath0 commutator algebra between the angular momentum generators , [ j_i , j_j]=i_ijkj_k.[s1 ] from the commutator between distinct species , [ x^_iy_j , y^_ly_m]=x^_iy_m_jl,[basiciii ] for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , on the other hand , one can show that @xmath38 is indeed a vector under the @xmath0 algebra , i. e.

    "let us remark in passing that the above derivation can be extended to higher dimensions , to consider , for example , the three - component mass hedgehog in the three - dimensional dirac equation.@xcite this case would involve distributing fermions and bosons over three quantum states to obtain the spectral degeneracies .",

    "the degeneracy pattern of the spectrum of the hamiltonian in eq.([generich ] ) ( fig.1 in ref.@xcite ) is similar to that of the bound spectrum in hydrogen .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate how the states within each eigenspace with @xmath58 are connected to each other via the application of the operators @xmath43 and @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , since the subspace of the second excited level with @xmath59 has a one - to - one correspondence with that of the first excited level with @xmath60 in the hydrogen atom , we should be able to see the exact correspondence in algebraic relations between the two cases .    first , a matrix representation for vector operator @xmath38 of eq .",

    "[ susy ] , it is evident that finding out the square roots of @xmath10 other than @xmath35 itself is then impossible . basically , it is due to the fact that the matrix @xmath168 has only one independent square root when the @xmath169 .",
    "terms in the dirac hamiltonian with the linear dependence on the coordinates may also occur in graphene , for example , in presence of the magnetic field perpendicular to the plane . in this case",
    "a rather different supersymmetry was found.@xcite yet another similar but maybe a better known case is the dirac oscillator@xcite with the hamiltonian h_os=_i(p_i - i_i ) .",
    "in this case the crucial difference from our problem lies in that the four dirac matrices @xmath170 that appear in @xmath171 do not close a clifford algebra , i.e. not all the pairs of matrices anticommute .",
    "the square of the hamiltonian , @xmath172 , contains a spin - orbit coupling @xmath173 in addition to the common part of oscillator hamiltonian as in our @xmath10 . here",
    ", the angular momentum @xmath174 and spin @xmath175 are defined .",
    "compared to the present problem , the extra term in @xmath172 can be any integer and half - integer , whereas the extra term @xmath176 in our problem can have the values @xmath177 only .",
    "these subtle differences ultimately lead to a rather different underlying ( super)symmetry and the ensuing degeneracies of the spectrum .    by solving the differential equation for the zero - mode s wave - function of our linearized hamiltonian",
    "one finds its radial dependence to be @xmath178 .",
    "thus , the linearization of the vortex profile is a good approximation when the coherence length is long , @xmath179 . also , in the case of strictly linear vortex amplitude , strong external zeeman field is not able to remove the zero - mode from the spectrum .",
    "this stands in contrast to the previously studied case of an order parameter which saturates to a finite value far from the vortex.@xcite the spinor part of zero - mode can be deduced from the matrix equation @xmath180 . using the previous notations in ref.@xcite , the fermion operators have the explicit matrix form ,    a_1= (    cccc&i_2&i_2 + & i_2&-i_2    ) , a_2= (    cccc&-i_1&ii_2 + & -ii_2&i_1    ) , which yields the column vector @xmath181 for the zero - mode .",
    "lastly , the treatment of chemical potential and zeeman field with two projections @xmath96 and @xmath97 is also relevant to a recent study on two - velocity weyl fermions realized in two - dimensional optical lattice.@xcite the effective low - energy hamiltonian for the spinless fermions can be written as    h_w = k_x_1+k_y_2+(ik_x_1+ik_y_2 ) , which yields the eigenvalues @xmath182 , and @xmath183 is a number indicating the difference in  speed of light \" .",
    "actually the above weyl hamiltonian can be expressed as a more compact form as one notices that the sets of matrices @xmath184 and @xmath185 form two commutating @xmath186 lie algebras .",
    "thus a generic hamiltonian of    h_g=+ , with components @xmath187 and @xmath188 , can be co - rotated into @xmath189 .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath190 , which explains that the faster / slower weyl fermions in fact correspond to the odd - fermion / even - fermion subspaces in our definition .    in conclusion , for the two - dimensional linearized vortex on the superconducting surface of topological insulator , we defined the corresponding supersymmetric runge - lenz - pauli operator , and discussed the connection to its counterpart in the hydrogen atom .",
    "we also studied the effects of the physical perturbations such as finite chemical potential and zeeman coupling of the spin to the out - of plane magnetic field on the spectrum , and showed how these can be economically accounted for in terms of the even / odd - fermion projection operators which we introduced . in the most general case ,",
    "the accidental degeneracy of the spectrum is removed by these perturbations , but the energy of the zero - mode is unaltered .",
    "unexpectedly , however , we found that some of the accidental degeneracy remains present when the chemical potential and the zeeman field have identical magnitudes .",

    "within the subspace of states of @xmath78 , the wave functions with the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath63 belong to the @xmath191-multiplet .",
    "explicitly , the pair of opposite - energy states can be written as ,     in @xmath115 is obtained by applying @xmath192 to the above states .",
