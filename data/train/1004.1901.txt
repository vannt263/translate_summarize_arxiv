    "one of the challenging computational problems in the study of self - avoiding walks ( saw ) @xcite - a statistical mechanical model for describing the excluded volume interaction of a linear polymer chain - is to estimate the configurational density of states ( dos ) as accurately as possible so that their equilibrium thermodynamic properties can be worked out .",
    "equivalently , the problem is to find an efficient method for generating all possible configurations of a saw .",
    "since the total number of saw configurations increases exponentially with the length , @xmath3 , of the walk , there is a need to devise efficient sampling techniques for generating as wide a spectrum of configurations as possible .",
    "the standard unbiased methods of generating saw configurations @xcite , on a regular lattice , not only suffer from sample - attrition problem but also fail to generate low - entropy configurations in sufficient numbers .",
    "in other words , an unbiased method generates only typical saw configurations with equal _ a priori _ probability ; low - entropy ( or compact ) configurations are rarely generated because of their very low probability of occurrence in the microcanonical ensemble of all possible configurations .",
    "so , kinetic growth walk ( kgw ) @xcite was proposed as a method for introducing local bias in the generation process so that the typical saw configurations generated are more compact than the ones generated by the unbiased method ; the sample - attrition problem also is less severe .",
    "the probability of generating a given kgw configuration depends on the way it is grown step - by - step .",
    "since the cumulative bias introduced for generating a successful kgw configuration is known , it can be removed by suitably weighting the configuration .",
    "recently , prellberg and krawczyk @xcite have shown that the kgw algorithm is actually an approximate counting algorithm in which the weights associated with the walk configurations are the estimates of the number of configurations . during the generation process ,",
    "decision to stop or continue the walk ( a certain number of times ) is based on how the weight , @xmath4 , associated with it compares with the average of weights , @xmath5 , associated with all the successful , as well as failed , configurations thus far generated .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of trials , @xmath5 gives a fairly accurate estimate of the microcanonical partition function for saw .",
    "this algorithm , known as flatperm , can be used for estimating the dos if the configurations are binned with respect to the number of _ contacts _ ( _ i.e_. , non - bonded nearest neighbor pairs ) they make .",
    "a reasonably flat _",
    "contacts_-histogram , over the full range of contacts possible for a given value of @xmath3 , provides an independent numerical evidence that rare configurations are not missed .",
    "an interesting inverse problem is to find out whether the requirement of a flat energy - histogram ( or equivalently , _",
    "contacts_-histogram ) could lead to an accurate estimate of the dos .",
    "we show that such an inverse method can be devised and used for obtaining the dos , taking the interacting growth walk ( igw ) algorithm as an example .",
    "igw @xcite is a finite temperature ( @xmath6 ) generalization of the kgw that grows by boltzmann - sampling the locally available sites according to the number of contacts ( or , energy ) they would make .",
    "we show that the inverse method dictates adjusting the parameter , @xmath6 , which is equivalent to adjusting the weight of the growing configuration .",
    "we compute the fisher zeros @xcite corresponding to the dos , estimated for saw on a square lattice , and locate the @xmath0-point .",
    "agreement with the expected value of the transition temperature justifies the idea of an inverse algorithm which is similar in spirit to the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) algorithm of mcgreevy and pusztai @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the igw model for generating lattice saws whose compactness can be tuned by a parameter .",
    "we point out that averaging the bias - correcting weights over all attempts to generate walks of given length gives an estimate of the microcanonical partition function . in the first part of section iii , using the examples of kgw and igw on a honeycomb lattice , we show that the growth rule of flatperm consists of two independent parts - ( i ) a _ local _ kgw rule and ( ii ) a _ global _ weight - based rule for continuing a walk ; in particular , we show that the weight - based rule can not in general be reinterpreted in terms of a bath temperature . in the second part of this section , we define the inverse algorithm , flatigw , whose step - growth rules are dynamically adjusted by the requirement of local flatness for the energy histogram . in section iv , we present the monte carlo estimates of the dos obtained for saws on a square as well as triangular lattice",
    ". we also present an extrapolation analysis of the fisher zeros obtained for square lattice saws . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "starting from an arbitrary site of a regular lattice of coordination number , @xmath7 , the first step is taken in one of the available @xmath7 directions ; choice for the subsequent steps is made from among the @xmath8 nearest neighbor sites in the forward direction . in the unbiased sampling method ,",
    "an attempt to generate a walk is discarded if the site chosen has been visited already . even though this method ensures that the successful configurations are all generated with equal probability , @xmath9 , the rejection rate increases exponentially with the length of the walk because of which it fails to generate sufficient number of successful walks needed for good statistical analysis .",
    "an immediate solution to this problem is to choose at random one of the available , or unvisited , nearest neighbors for the next step to be taken .",
    "the number of available sites for the @xmath10 step , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 $ ] ) , depends on the configuration @xmath13 already generated .",
    "it is clear that this method , known as the kgw , introduces bias at every step of the walk .",
    "however , sample - attrition is less severe in this case and is only due to the geometrical trapping ( @xmath14 ) of the walk .",
    "the cumulative bias introduced during the generation process can be removed by associating a weight , @xmath15 , with a configuration .",
    "these weights , referred to as the rosenbluth - rosenbluth ( rr ) weights @xcite , may be used for estimating the mean squared end - to - end distance , @xmath16 as @xmath3 becomes larger , the distribution of these rr - weights becomes flatter and so , the weighted averages fail to provide bias - corrected estimates in the asymptotic limit of very long walks .    averaging the rr - weights over all the configurations , trapped or successful , we obtain an estimate of the total number of @xmath3-step saws @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of attempts made by the kgw algorithm to generate @xmath3-step saws ; since the weights associated with those configurations that have been trapped at various stages are zero , the summation is only over all the successful configurations .",
    "@xmath19 will give the total number ( equivalently , the microcanonical partition function ) of @xmath3-step saws , @xmath20 , in the limit @xmath21 .    since any given kgw configuration , @xmath22 , will have a certain number of non - bonded nearest neighbor pairs ( _ contacts _ ) , we can equivalently define , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rr - weight associated with a configuration that has @xmath25 contacts . in the limit @xmath21 , therefore , @xmath26 is the total number of @xmath3-step saws with @xmath25 contacts , which is the dos .",
    "it must be noted that the kgw algorithm is blind to the contacts being made during growth - _ i.e. , _ identifying and counting the contacts are not a part of the basic growth rule .    on the other hand , igw algorithm @xcite samples the available nearest neighbors on the basis of the number of contacts they would make .",
    "the probability that an available nearest neighbor site , say @xmath27 , for the @xmath10 step will be chosen is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of contacts the site @xmath27 would make , and @xmath30 is the energy cost of a contact .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is an inverse temperature that helps sample the local environment . for @xmath32 ,",
    "this is just the kgw growth rule ; for @xmath33 , only the site making a maximum number of contacts will be chosen .",
    "interestingly , there is no sample - attrition in the limit @xmath33 because a _",
    "contact_-making site can not be avoided during growth , and the walks thus generated are maximally ( not globally ) compact . even though @xmath6 can not be identified with a canonical bath temperature @xcite , it has been shown @xcite that a coil - to - globule transition can be identified for some lattice - dependent value of @xmath6 .",
    "as in the case of kgw , a weight @xmath34 can be associated with a given igw configuration , @xmath35 so that an estimate of the microcanonical partition function for saw is given by the average , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of attempts made by the igw algorithm to generate @xmath3-step saws , and @xmath38 is the number of contacts in @xmath22 . in the limit @xmath39 , the microcanonical partition function obtained this way is independent of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the dos is then given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the weight associated with an igw configuration @xmath22 with @xmath25 contacts . for @xmath32 , it is just the rr - weight . on the other hand , averaging only the weights , @xmath34 , @xmath42 leads to the canonical partition function at the bath temperature @xmath6 in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a typical kgw configuration is more compact than a typical saw configuration because it is generated by sampling only sites available for growth with the same probability ; this introduces a local bias not because it distinguishes between the available sites but because the number of available sites is random and configuration - dependent .",
    "flatperm uses the rr - weights to decide whether the walk should be continued and with what adjustment to its rr - weight .",
    "so , the growth rule consists of two independent parts - ( i ) _ local _ ( equivalently , the kgw ) sampling of the available nearest neighbors with equal probability , and ( ii ) _ global _ check on how the rr - weight of the currently growing configuration compares with a cumulative average .",
    "the _ local _",
    "( kgw ) growth rule is independent of the _ global _ weights - based rule and , is never modified .",
    "the objective of this section is to use the solvable models of kgw and igw on a honeycomb lattice in order to demonstrate that this independence is mutual .",
    "( 1 )    poole _ et al . , _ @xcite have shown that kgw on a honeycomb lattice is equivalent to the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) at the inverse bath temperature @xmath43 .",
    "this is so because , on a honeycomb lattice , a walk makes a contact if only one nearest neighbor site is available for further growth .",
    "therefore , the probability of generating a walk , @xmath22 , with @xmath44 contacts is given by @xmath45 where each contact is assigned energy @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that kgw is equivalent to isaw at a bath temperature @xmath47 .",
    "since the bath temperature is higher than the @xmath0 temperature on a honeycomb lattice ( @xmath48 ) , kgw is in the same universality class as saw and therefore , _ unweighted _ averaging of the end - to - end distances of kgw also yields the saw value for the size - exponent @xmath49 .",
    "however , configuration - dependence of @xmath50 necessitates weighting the configurations appropriately so that they represent a _ bona fide _ statistical ensemble .",
    "the ( microcanonical ) weight associated with a kgw configuration , @xmath22 , is then given by @xmath51 this is just the rr - weight for a kgw configuration because @xmath52 corresponds to the athermal case on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the flatperm parameter , @xmath53 , is then defined as the ratio @xmath54 where @xmath18 is the total number of attempts made ( successful or failed ) .",
    "since @xmath55 is a constant , we have the ratio , @xmath56 if @xmath57 , the walk will be continued with probability @xmath53 after resetting its weight to be equal to @xmath58 .",
    "this situation is realized when the current configuration is more compact ( with @xmath46 ) than an average or typical configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath59 , it is copied @xmath60 min@xmath61,z_a)$ ] times , and each copy continued after reducing its weight by @xmath62 ; here , @xmath63 $ ] is the largest integer less than @xmath53 and @xmath64 is the number of available sites . in this case",
    ", the walk is less compact ( with @xmath46 ) than a typical configuration and therefore can be reused ;    resetting the weight , @xmath65 or @xmath66 , is formally equivalent to resetting the inverse temperature @xmath67 to a value given by @xmath68 this only provides an alternative interpretation of the _ global _ weight - based rule for a chain - growth process because of the known fact that the bath temperature decides the degree of compactness of a typical configuration .",
    "however , this can not be used as a parameter in the _ local _ growth rule because there is nothing to distinguish one available nearest neighbor from another for taking a given step .    on a lattice of coordination number @xmath69 , even a configuration - independent bath temperature for kgw",
    "can not be defined @xcite .",
    "for example , on a square lattice ( @xmath70 ) , a walk makes a single ( or double ) contact if the site chosen has one ( or two ) occupied non - bonded nearest neighbor .",
    "note that the walk is geometrically trapped if it chooses a site having three occupied non - bonded nearest neighbors .",
    "it is clear that the number of single ( @xmath71 and double @xmath72 contacts made is configuration - dependent .",
    "averaging over all the configurations having the same total number ( @xmath25 ) of contacts , but with different sets of single and double contacts , @xmath73 , we can define an @xmath25-dependent inverse temperature , @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes configurational averages .",
    "since these @xmath76-values are sharply distributed about the value @xmath77 ( width @xmath78 ) in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath79 ) @xcite , kgw may be said to be equivalent to isaw at an _ effective _ bath temperature , @xmath77 ; but the converse is not true .",
    "if , however , the unweighted averaging of the end - to - end distances for kgw also gives the saw value for @xmath80 @xcite , it is because @xmath81 is higher than the @xmath0 temperature ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "hence , even reinterpreting the _ global _ weight - based rule in terms of a bath temperature is not straightforward for walks on a lattice of coordination number @xmath83 .",
    "( 2 )    since an igw samples the available nearest neighbors on the basis of the number of contacts they would make , the individual steps of the walk on a honeycomb lattice may be identified either as _ two - indexed _ steps or as _ forced _ steps @xcite . a two - indexed step , labeled @xmath84 $ ] , is a step to an available site making @xmath85 contacts rather than to the other available site making @xmath86 contacts ; on a honeycomb lattice , @xmath87 .",
    "steps labeled @xmath88 , [ 2,1]$ ] and @xmath89 $ ] indicate that the walk is geometrically trapped .",
    "forced steps are those that have no other choice but to take the only site available ; they are preceded either by contact - making two - indexed steps or by forced steps .    the probability of generating a walk , @xmath22 , with @xmath38 contacts is given by @xmath90}\\beta",

    "however , by adjusting the value of @xmath31 continuously during the growth process , we may be able to generate the desired saw ensemble because , the _ local _ igw rule distinguishes the available nearest neighbor sites on the basis of the number of contacts they would make .",
    "what is required is a _ global _ criterion that dictates appropriate adjustments to the value of @xmath31 at every step .",
    "the fact that a flat energy - histogram is an indicator of an efficient dos algorithm raises the question whether a requirement of local flatness for an energy - histogram , which is building up during the simulation , can be used as a _ global _",
    "criterion for tuning @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath111 denote the number of @xmath112-step igws having @xmath113 contacts ( @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the maximum number of contacts possible for a @xmath112-step walk ) .",
    "a perfectly flat energy histogram corresponds to having the same value @xmath111 for all @xmath113 . if @xmath116 , the number of @xmath112-step walks having @xmath113 contacts is more , or less , than those having @xmath117 contacts .",
    "so , the difference , @xmath118 , may be taken as a measure of the deviation from local flatness .",
    "suppose , a @xmath112-step walk segment has already made @xmath113 contacts . since it is an irreversibly growing walk , the number of contacts , @xmath113 , can not decrease during further growth",
    "; it can either increase or remain the same . before taking the @xmath119 step",
    ", we should check whether it is desirable , or not , to increase the number of contacts . we assume , for simplicity , that no available site increases @xmath113 by more than one .    since @xmath31 is the parameter that controls the extent to which a contact - making site is preferred , or avoided , its value for the @xmath119 step may be chosen so that @xmath120 does not increase .",
    "for example , if @xmath121 , @xmath122 must have a negative value so that the _ local _ igw growth - rule avoids a contact - making site ; on the other hand , if @xmath123 , @xmath122 must have a positive value so that a contact - making site is preferred .",
    "the actual value of @xmath122 should depend on @xmath120 .",
    "the simplest choice is to have @xmath124 , with the proportionality factor , say @xmath125 , chosen conveniently by trial and error .",
    "we have taken @xmath125 to be a uniform random number in the unit interval @xcite and tried the following rule : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the maximum value conveniently chosen to be within the overflow / underflow limits .",
    "the actual value of @xmath128 used for the @xmath119 step is given by @xmath129 hence , the step - growth probability defined in eq.([eq : pigw ] ) for constant @xmath31 has to be redefined as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the site taken by the @xmath119 step , @xmath132 is the number of contacts made by occupying that site ( assumed to be either 0 or 1 for simplicity ) and @xmath133 is the number of sites available for the @xmath134 step .",
    "the procedure , presented above , can easily be rewritten for the case when there is also an available site that increases @xmath113 by more than one .    depending on whether a contact is made or not at the @xmath119 step , @xmath135 or @xmath136 is incremented by one count .",
    "simultaneously , we have a variable @xmath137 or @xmath138 representing the cumulative weights of all the @xmath139-step configurations generated .",
    "the weights , essentially defined by eq.([eq : pigw ] ) and eq.([eq : wtigw ] ) , have to reflect the fact that the growth parameter @xmath122 is tuned at every step .",

    "the flat histograms seen are evidence that the local criterion used for adjusting @xmath152 , eq.([eq : delta ] and eq.([eq : dbeta4 ] ) , does bring about global flatness to the histogram data . the observation , fig.([flatdoscmp ] ) , that estimates of the dos for short walks agree well with those obtained by exact enumeration gives confidence that the inverse algorithm , flatigw , is as good as flatperm . dos estimated for longer walks , @xmath112 in the range @xmath153 to @xmath154 are shown in fig.([flatdossqr ] ) . reduced histogram and the dos estimates obtained , with @xmath155 , for walks on a triangular lattice",
    "are shown in fig.([flattri ] ) .",
    "initially , a few trial runs may be necessary to fix suitable values of @xmath150 for different lattices .",
    "estimates of the dos can be used for computing the specific heat of isaw at any given bath temperature and , in general , for computing the phase diagram .",
    "isaw is known to undergo a transition from random coil phase to @xmath0-phase and finally to a compact phase at temperatures that depend on the lattice used .",
    "so , locating a transition temperature , say the @xmath0-temperature , will be a test for the accuracy of dos estimates .    an interesting technique for locating a phase transition is to compute fisher zeros of the canonical partition function , and check the ( real ) temperature to which they would converge .",
    "since the walks generated are all of finite lengths , it is necessary to extrapolate the estimated temperatures to the asymptotic limit .",
    "zeros of the polynomial , @xmath156 , in the variable @xmath157 with the flatigw estimates of the dos as the coefficients , obtained for square lattice walks of length @xmath158 , are shown in fig.([pzn24 ] ) along with those obtained by exact enumeration of @xmath159-step saws on a square lattice .",
    "the agreement is quite good . as the walk length increases",
    ", it is expected that there will be a crowding of zeros in the neighborhood of the positive real axis ; fig.([pzflat ] ) demonstrates this crowding of zeros for walks of lengths @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "numerical estimates of @xmath162 , the value at which a real zero is expected , obtained for various values of @xmath3 are plotted as function of @xmath163 in fig.([pzintercept ] ) .",
    "a simple extrapolation of the data gives the asymptotic value @xmath164 .",
    "this implies that @xmath165 which is in close agreement with the known value @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that flatigw can also be used for studying the statistical and thermodynamical properties of isaw on a regular or disordered lattice .",
    "recognizing the fact that the set of numbers , @xmath167 , evolve as a rough surface , @xmath150 may be thought of as bounding lines within which the fluctuations of the @xmath168-surface are confined .",
    "so , it is intuitively clear that the @xmath168-surface will asymptotically reach a stationary flat state ; the time required for reaching this state and the asymptotic flatness will depend on @xmath150 .",
    "flatigw is an inverse algorithm in the following sense .",
    "the growth - rule of the flatigw consists of two parts - ( i ) _ local _ igw rule for sampling the available nearest neighbor sites and , ( ii ) _ global _ rule requiring that the energy - histogram evolves in such a way as to maintain local flatness .",
    "the latter is used for adjusting the parameter , @xmath31 , on which the former depends .",
    "so , these two parts of the growth - rule are inter - dependent .",
    "an indicator that this algorithm works is the ( statistical ) convergence of dos towards their stationay values , as the weights assigned to the walks are accumulated independently during the simulation runs . in the direct methods , on the contrary ,",
    "an indicator that the dos converges to their stationary values is flattening of the energy - histogram during simulation ; moreover , the _ local _ and the _ global _ components of the growth rule are independent .",
    "flatigw is an inverse algorithm similar in spirit to the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) algorithm of mcgreevy and pusztai @xcite , in which the model - parameters are adjusted so as to be consistent with the experimental data rather than by the standard metropolis criterion .",
    "however , the local flatness criterion , used in the step - growth rule , is not such a rigid constraint that a perfectly flat energy - histogram may be expected asymptotically .",
    "for instance , when @xmath169 for all the available sites , @xmath170 and therefore one of the sites will be chosen at random with equal probability ; this will spoil the local flatness .",
    "it must be mentioned here that the rule , eq.([eq : delta ] ) , used for adjusting @xmath31 in the algorithm is arbitrary and introduces one more parameter , @xmath150 , besides using a randomizing factor @xmath125 .",
    "this will affect the computational efficiency of the algorithm when compared to the other ones such as flatperm @xcite and multi - canonical chain growth algorithm @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the main objective of this work is to demonstrate that an inverse , histogram - driven algorithm ( _ a la _ rmc ) can be constructed for computing the dos of linear polymers . a detailed comparative study of this algorithm _ vis - a - vis",
    "_ others will be helpful .",
    "we have demonstrated that an inverse algorithm , flatigw , that is similar in spirit to the reverse monte carlo algorithm @xcite can be implemented for estimating the dos of linear lattice polymers .",
    "this algorithm generates a saw step - by - step and irreversibly by using the igw growth rule , eq.([eq : pigw ] ) , for a biased sampling of the available nearest neighbor sites ; whether a contact - making available site is preferred or not is decided by a parameter , @xmath31 , whose value is decided by the requirement of local flatness for the evolving energy - histogram .",
    "the dos converge to their stationary values , as the statistical weights associated with the walk configurations accumulate independently during the simulation runs .",
    "we have used this inverse algorithm to estimate the dos for saw on a square , as well as triangular , lattice .",
    "we have located the @xmath0 temperature for square lattice saws by analyzing the fisher zeros corresponding to their dos estimates .",

    "<S> we show that the density of states ( dos ) for lattice self avoiding walks can be estimated by using an inverse algorithm , called flatigw , whose step - growth rules are dynamically adjusted by requiring the energy histogram to be locally flat . here , the ( attractive ) energy associated with a configuration is taken to be proportional to the number of non - bonded nearest neighbor pairs ( contacts ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy histogram is able to explicitly direct the growth of a walk because the step - growth rule of the interacting growth walk @xcite samples the available nearest neighbor sites according to the number of contacts they would make . </S>",
