    "is it worthwhile to reinvent classical electrodynamics after it has been with us for more than a century ? and after its quantized version , quantum electrodynamics ( unified with the weak interaction ) had turned out to be one of the most accurately tested successful theories ?",
    "we believe that the answer should be affirmative .",
    "moreover , we believe that this reformulation should be done such that it is also comprehensible and useful for experimental physicists and ( electrical ) engineers .",
    "let us collect some of the reasons in favor of such a reformulation .",
    "first of all an `` axiomatics '' of electrodynamics should allow us to make the fundamental structure of electrodynamics transparent , see , e.g. , sommerfeld @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we will follow the tradition of kottler - cartan - van dantzig , see truesdell & toupin @xcite and post @xcite , and base our theory on two experimentally well established axioms expressed in terms of integrals , conservation of electric charge and magnetic flux , and a local axiom , the existence of the lorentz force .",
    "all three axioms can be formulated in a 4-dimensional ( spacetime ) continuum without using the distance concept ( i.e.  without the use of a metric ) , see schrdinger @xcite .",
    "only the fourth axiom , a suitable constitutive law , is specific for the `` material '' under consideration which is interacting with the electromagnetic field .",
    "the vacuum is a particular example of such a material . in the fourth axiom",
    ", the distance concept eventually shows up and gives the 4-dimensional continuum an additional structure .",
    "some of the questions one can answer with the help of such a general framework are : is the electric excitation @xmath5 a _ microscopic _ quantity like the field strength @xmath6 ? is it justified to give @xmath5 another dimension than @xmath6 ?",
    "the analogous questions can be posed for the magnetic excitation @xmath7 and the field strength @xmath8 .",
    "should we expect a magnetic monopole and an explicit magnetic charge to arise in such an electrodynamic framework ?",
    "can we immediately pinpoint the ( metric - independent ) constitutive law for a 2-dimensional electron gas in the theory of the quantum hall effect ?",
    "does the non - linear born - infeld electrodynamics fit into this general scheme ? how do maxwell s equations look in an accelerated reference frame or in a strong gravitational field as around a neutron star ?",
    "how do they look in a possible non - riemannian spacetime ? is a possible pseudoscalar axion field compatible with electrodynamics ? and eventually , on a more formal level , is the calculus of exterior differential forms more appropriate for describing electrodynamics than the 3-dimensional euclidean vector calculus and its 4-dimensional generalization ? can the metric of spacetime be derived from suitable assumptions about the constitutive law ?",
    "it is really the status of electrodynamics within the whole of physics which comes much clearer into focus if one follows up such an axiomatic approach .",
    "from a modern relativistic point of view , the formulation of electrodynamics has to take place in a 4-dimensional continuum ( differentiable manifold ) which eventually is to be identified with spacetime , i.e.  with a continuum described by one `` time '' coordinate @xmath9 and three `` space '' coordinates @xmath10 or , in short , by coordinates @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "let us suppress one space dimension in order to be able to depict the 4-dimensional as a 3-dimensional continuum , as shown in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "we assume that this continuum admits a foliation into a succession of different leaves or hypersurfaces @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , spacetime looks like a pile of leaves which can be numbered by a monotonically increasing ( time ) parameter @xmath14 . a leaf @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 .",
    "it represents , at a certain time @xmath14 , the ordinary 3-dimensional space surrounding us ( in fig.[f1 ] it is 2-dimensional , since one dimension is suppressed ) .    at any given point in @xmath15",
    ", we can introduce the covector @xmath17 and a 4-vector @xmath18 @xmath19 such that @xmath20 is normalized according to @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , summation over repeated indices is always understood .",
    "the vector @xmath24 is `` normal '' to the leaf @xmath15 , whereas the covector @xmath25 is tangential . ] to it .    with the pair",
    "@xmath26 we can construct projectors which decompose all tensor quantities into _ longitudinal _ and _ transversal _ constituents with respect to the vector @xmath20 , see fig.[f2 ] .",
    "indeed , the matrices @xmath27 represent projection operators , i.e. @xmath28    taking an arbitrary covector @xmath29 , we now can write it as @xmath30 obviously @xmath31 describes the longitudinal component of the covector and @xmath32 its transversal component , with @xmath33 .",
    "analogously , for an arbitrary vector @xmath34 , we can write @xmath35 its transversal component @xmath36 fulfills @xmath37 .",
    "this pattern can be straightforwardly generalized to all tensorial quantities of spacetime .    for simplicity ,",
    "we confine our attention to the particular case when `` adapted '' coordinates @xmath38 are used and when the `` spatial '' components of @xmath20 vanish , i.e. , @xmath39 . in that case , we simply have @xmath40 and hence @xmath14 can be treated as a formal `` time '' coordinate .",
    "the conservation of electric charge was already recognized as fundamental law during the time of franklin ( around 1750 ) well before coulomb discovered the force law in 1785 . nowadays , at a time ,",
    "at which one can catch single electrons and single protons in traps and can _ count _ them individually , we are more sure than ever that electric charge conservation is a valid fundamental law of nature . therefore matter carries as a _ primary quality _ something called electric charge which only occurs in positive or negative units of an elementary charge @xmath41 ( or , in the case of quarks , in @xmath42th of it ) and which can be counted in principle .",
    "thus it is justified to introduce the physical dimension of charge @xmath43 as a new and independent concept .",
    "ideally one should measure a charge in units of @xmath44 .",
    "however , for practical reasons , the si - unit c ( coulomb ) is used in laboratory physics .",
    "two remarks are in order : charge is an additive ( or extensive ) quantity that characterizes the source of the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is prior to the notion of the electric field strength .",
    "therefore it is _ not _ reasonable to measure , as is done in the cgs - system of units , the additive quantity charge in terms of the unit of force by applying coulomb s law .",
    "coulomb s law has no direct relation to charge conservation .",
    "secondly , in the si - system , for reasons of better realization , the ampere @xmath45 as current is chosen as the new fundamental unit rather than the coulomb .",
    "we have @xmath46 ( @xmath47 second ) .    as a preliminary step ,",
    "let us remind ourselves that , in a 4-dimensional picture , the motion of a point particle is described , as in fig.[f2 ] , by a curve in spacetime , by a so - called worldline .",
    "the tangent vectors of this worldline represent the 4-velocity of the particle .",
    "if we mark a 3-dimensional volume @xmath48 which belong to a certain hypersurface @xmath15 , then the total electric charge inside @xmath48 is @xmath49 with @xmath50 as the electric charge density .",
    "the total charge in space , which we find by integration over the whole of space , i.e. , by letting @xmath51 , is _ globally _ conserved .",
    "therefore the integral in ( [ charge ] ) over each hypersurface @xmath52 keeps the same value .",
    "the _ local _ conservation of charge , see fig.[f3 ] , translates into the following fact : if a number of worldlines of particles with one elementary charge enter a prescribed but arbitrary 4-dimensional volume @xmath53 , then , in classical physics , the same number has to leave the volume . if we count the entering worldlines as negative and the leaving ones as positive ( in conformity with the direction of their normal vectors ) , then the ( 3-dimensional ) surface integral over the number of worldlines has to vanish .",
    "now , the natural extensive quantities to be integrated over a 3-dimensional hypersurface are _ vector densities , _ see the appendix . accordingly , in nature there should exist a 4-vector density @xmath54 with 4 independent components which measures the charge piercing through an arbitrary 3-dimensional hypersurface .",
    "therefore , it generalizes in a consistent 4-dimensional formalism the familiar concepts of charge density @xmath50 and current density @xmath55 .",
    "the axiom of local charge conservation then reads @xmath56 where the integral is taken over the ( 3-dimensional ) _ boundary _ of an arbitrary 4-dimensional volume of spacetime , with @xmath57 being the 3-surface element , as defined in the appendix .",
    "if we apply stokes theorem , then we can transform the 3-surface integral in ( [ axiom1 ] ) into a 4-volume integral : @xmath58 since this is valid for an _ arbitrary _",
    "4-volume @xmath53 , we find the local version of the charge conservation as @xmath59 in this form , the law of conservation of charge is valid in arbitrary coordinates .    if one defines a particular foliation , then one can rewrite ( [ ax1local ] ) in terms of decomposed quantities that are longitudinal and transversal to the corresponding normal vector @xmath20 .",
    "the 4-vector density @xmath54 decomposes as @xmath60 when adapted coordinates are used , the decomposition procedure simplifies and allows to define the 3-dimensional densities of charge @xmath50 and of current @xmath55 as @xmath61 with this , one can rewrite the definition of charge ( [ charge ] ) in an explicitly coordinate invariant form @xmath62 since on @xmath15 we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 . furthermore , eq.([ax1local ] ) can be rewritten in ( 1 + 3)-form as the more familiar continuity equation @xmath65    the charge @xmath66 in ( [ charge1 ] ) has the absolute dimension .",
    "the _ components _ pick up a @xmath67 ( a @xmath68 ) for an upper ( a lower ) temporal index and an @xmath69 ( an @xmath70 ) for an upper ( a lower ) spatial index . a statement , see @xcite , that @xmath6 and @xmath71 must have the same dimension since they transform into each other is empty without specifying the underlying theory of dimensions . ]",
    "the 4-current is a density in spacetime , and we have @xmath72=q/(t\\,l^3)$ ] .",
    "thus the components carry the dimensions @xmath73=[{\\cal j}^0]=q / l^3 \\stackrel{{\\rm si}}{=}c / m^3 $ ] and @xmath74=[{\\cal j}^a]=q/(t\\,l^2)\\stackrel{{\\rm si}}{=}a / m^2 $ ] .",
    "because of axiom 1 and according to a theorem of de rham , see @xcite , the electric current density from ( [ axiom1 ] ) or ( [ ax1local ] ) can be represented as a `` divergence '' of the _ electromagnetic excitation _ : @xmath75 the excitation @xmath76 is a contravariant antisymmetric tensor density and has 6 independent components .",
    "one can verify that , due to the antisymmetry of @xmath76 , the conservation law is automatically fulfilled , i.e. , @xmath77 .    the 4-dimensional set ( [ jexact ] ) represents the inhomogeneous maxwell equations .",
    "they surface here in a very natural way as a result of charge conservation .",
    "charge conservation should not be looked at as a consequence of the inhomogeneous maxwell equations , but rather the other way round , as shown in this tutorial .",
    "of course , @xmath78 is not yet fully determined since @xmath79 also satisfies ( [ jexact ] ) for an arbitrary covector field @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81-decomposition of @xmath76 is obtained similarly to the decomposition of the current ( [ jdecomp ] ) : @xmath82 the nontrivial components of the longitudinal and transversal parts read @xmath83 with the electric excitation @xmath84 ( historical name : `` dielectric displacement '' ) and the magnetic excitation @xmath85 ( `` magnetic field '' ) . here",
    "@xmath86 is the totally antisymmetric 3-dimensional levi - civita tensor density with @xmath87 .",
    "if we substitute the decompositions ( [ jdecomp ] ) and ( [ hdecomp ] ) into ( [ jexact ] ) , we recover the 3-dimensional form of the inhomogeneous maxwell equations , @xmath88 or , in symbolic notation , @xmath89 since electric charge conservation is valid in microphysics , the corresponding maxwell equations ( [ 3dmax ] ) or ( [ 3dmaxsymb ] ) are also _ microphysical _ equations and with them the excitations @xmath84 and @xmath85 are microphysical quantities likewise  in contrast to what is stated in most textbooks , see @xcite and @xcite , compare also @xcite , e.g ..    from ( [ 3dmax ] ) we can immediately read off @xmath90=[l\\,\\rho]=q / l^2\\stackrel{\\rm si}{=}c / m^3 $ ] and @xmath91=[l\\,j^a]=q/(t\\,l)\\stackrel{\\rm si}{=}a / m$ ] . before we ever talked about _ forces _ on charges , charge conservation alone gave us the inhomogeneous maxwell equations including the appropriate dimensions for the excitations @xmath84 and @xmath92 .    under the assumption that @xmath84 vanishes inside an ideal electric conductor , one can get rid of the indeterminacy of @xmath93 , as spelled out in ( [ hgauge ] ) , and we can measure @xmath93 by means of two identical conducting plates ( `` maxwellian double plates '' ) which touch each other and which are _ separated _ in the @xmath84-field to be measured .",
    "the charge on one plate is then measured .",
    "analogous remarks apply to @xmath92 .",
    "accordingly , the excitations do have a direct _ operational _ significance .",
    "by now we have exhausted the information contained in the axiom 1 of charge conservation .",
    "we have to introduce new concepts in order to complete the fundamental structure of maxwell s theory .",
    "whereas the excitation @xmath94 is linked to the charge current @xmath95 , the electric and magnetic field strengths are usually introduced as forces acting on unit charges at rest or in motion , respectively . in the purely electric case with a test charge @xmath43",
    ", we have in terms of components @xmath96 with @xmath97 as force and @xmath6 as electric field covector .",
    "let us take a ( delta - function - like ) test charge current @xmath98 centered around a point with spatial coordinates @xmath99 .",
    "generalizing ( [ coul ] ) , the simplest relativistic ansatz for defining the electromagnetic field reads : @xmath100 we know from lagrangian mechanics that the _ force _ @xmath101 is represented by a _ covector _ with the absolute dimension of action @xmath102 (",
    "here @xmath102 is _ not _ the planck constant but rather only denotes its _ dimension _ ) .",
    "accordingly , with the covectorial force density @xmath103 , the ansatz ( [ fieldansatz1 ] ) can be made more precise as axiom 2 : @xmath104 the newly introduced covariant 2nd - rank 4-tensor @xmath105 is the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "the force density @xmath103 was postulated to be normal to the current , @xmath106 .",
    "thus the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic field strength is found , i.e. , @xmath105 depends on 6 independent components . we know",
    "the notion of force from mechanics , the current density we know from axiom 1 .",
    "accordingly , axiom 2 is to be understood as an _ operational _ definition of the electromagnetic field strength @xmath105 .    with the decomposition @xmath107",
    "we find the identifications for the electric field strength @xmath108 and the magnetic field strength @xmath109 ( historical names : `` magnetic induction '' or `` magnetic flux density '' ) : @xmath110 these identifications are reasonable since for the spatial components of ( [ fieldansatz2 ] ) we recover the lorentz force density and , for the static case , eq.([coul ] ) : @xmath111 symbolically , we have @xmath112 the time component of ( [ fieldansatz2 ] ) represents the electromagnetic power density : @xmath113",

    "we are in need of an experimentally established law that relates to @xmath119 .",
    "and we would prefer , as in the case of the electric charge , to recur to a counting procedure .",
    "what else can we count in relation to the electromagnetic field",
    "? certainly _ magnetic flux lines _ in the interior of a type ii superconductor which is exposed to a sufficiently strong magnetic field . and",
    "these flux lines are quantized .",
    "in fact , they can order in a 2-dimensional triangular abrikosov lattice , see fig.[f4 ] .",
    "these flux lines carry a unit of magnetic flux , a so - called flux quantum or _ fluxon _ with @xmath120 see tinkham @xcite ; here @xmath13 _ is _ the planck constant and @xmath41 the elementary charge .",
    "these flux lines can move , via its surface , in or out of the superconductor , but they can not vanish ( unless two lines with different sign collide ) or spontaneously come into existence .",
    "in other words , there is a strong experimental evidence that magnetic flux is a conserved quantity .",
    "the number @xmath121 in the relation @xmath122 is due to the fact that the cooper pairs in a superconductor consist of 2 electrons .",
    "moreover , outside a superconductor the magnetic flux is _ not _ quantized , i.e. , we can not count the flux lines there with the same ease that we could use inside .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see , experiments clearly show that the magnetic flux is conserved also there .    as we can take from fig.[f4 ]",
    ", the magnetic flux should be defined as a 2-dimensional spatial integral .",
    "these flux lines are additive and we have @xmath123    here @xmath109 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath124 the spatial 2-surface element .",
    "this definition of the magnetic flux should be compared with the definition ( [ charge ] ) of the charge . here , in ( [ flux ] ) , we integrate only over @xmath121 dimensions rather than over @xmath125 dimensions , as in the case of the charge in ( [ charge ] ) .",
    "thus in a spacetime picture in which one space dimension is suppressed , see fig.[f5 ] , our magnetic flux integral looks like an integral over a finite interval @xmath126 $ ] embedded into the hypersurface @xmath127 .",
    "now we are going to argue again as in sec.3 . if @xmath128 , i.e. , if we integrate over an infinite spatial 2-surface ( @xmath129 ) , then the total magnetic flux at time @xmath130 is given by ( [ flux ] ) .",
    "if we propagate that interval into the ( coordinate ) future , see the interval on the hypersurface @xmath131 , then magnetic flux conservation requires the constancy of the integral @xmath132 . in other words , if we orient the integration domain suitably , the loop integral , the domain of which is drawn in fig.[f5 ] , has to vanish since no flux is supposed to leak out along the dotted `` vertical '' domains at spatial infinity .",
    "analogously as we did in the case of charge conservation , we want to formulate a corresponding local conservation law in an explicitly covariant way .",
    "we saw that the global conservation of magnetic flux is expressed as the vanishing of the integral of @xmath133 over the particular 2-dimensional loop in fig.[f5 ] . in a 4-dimensional covariant formalism",
    ", the natural intensive objects to be integrated over a 2-dimensional region are second order antisymmetric covariant tensors , see the appendix .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath133 is just a piece of the electromagnetic field strength @xmath119 .",
    "thus , it is clear that the natural local generalization of the magnetic flux conservation , our axiom 3 , is @xmath134 where the integral is taken over the boundary of an arbitrary 3-dimensional hypersurface of spacetime , as is sketched in fig.[f6 ] .",

    ". then we find the homogeneous maxwell equations , @xmath137 or , symbolically , @xmath138 thus both , the sourcelessness of @xmath109 and the faraday induction law follow from magnetic flux conservation . both laws are experimentally very well verified and , in turn , strongly support the axiom of the conservation of the magnetic flux .",
    "the recognition that maxwell s theory , besides on charge conservation , is based on magnetic flux conservation , sheds new light on the possible existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "first of all , careful search for them has not lead to any signature of their possible existence , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , magnetic flux conservation would be violated if we postulated the existence of a current on the right hand side of ( [ axiom3 ] ) .",
    "now , eq.([ax1local ] ) is the analog of ( [ axiom3 ] ) , at least in our axiomatic set - up .",
    "why should we believe in charge conservation any longer if we gave up magnetic flux conservation ?",
    "accordingly , we assume  in contrast to most elementary particle physicists , see cheng & li @xcite  that in maxwell s theory proper there is no place for a magnetic current ) could be non - vanishing , as in the case of a dirac monopole with a string , see @xcite .",
    "] on the right hand side of ( [ axiom3 ] ) .",
    "the maxwell equations ( [ jexact ] ) and ( [ axiom3 ] ) or , in the decomposed version , ( [ 3dmaxsymb ] ) and ( [ hommax ] ) , respectively , encompass altogether 6 partial differential equations with a first order time derivative ( the 2 remaining equations can be understood as constraints to the initial configuration ) . since excitations and field strengths add up to @xmath139 independent components ,",
    "certainly the maxwellian set is underdetermined with respect to the time propagation of the electromagnetic field .",
    "what we clearly need is a relation between the excitations and the field strengths .",
    "as we will see , these so - called constitutive equations require additional knowledge about the properties of spacetime whereas the maxwell equations , as derived so far , are of universal validity as long as classical physics is a valid approximation . in particular , in the riemannian space of einstein s gravitational theory the maxwell equations look just the same as in ( [ jexact ] ) and ( [ axiom3 ] ) .",
