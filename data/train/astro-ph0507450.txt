    "imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes use large mirror areas to reflect the cherenkov photons from cosmic - ray and gamma - ray air showers onto a photo - detector camera , usually comprised of photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the number of photoelectrons generated at each pmt is directly proportional to the charge under the pmt output pulse , and this is easily measured using adcs with fixed - length integration gates .",
    "an alternative method is to use `` flash '' adcs to rapidly sample the output pulse and record the complete pulse shape .",
    "this allows to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio for individual pulses at the analysis stage , lowering the effective energy threshold of the telescope @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have suggested that the timing and pulse shape information could also be used to improve sensitivity through improved gamma - hadron separation or better reconstruction of shower parameters ( core location , primary energy , etc . )",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "a preliminary examination of the timing information provided by the veritas fadcs verifies that the effective charge integration gate can be reduced to @xmath0 .",
    "while the muon background currently limits the analysis threshold of the first veritas telescope , the reduced charge integration gate should result in a correspondingly reduced energy threshold for analysis when stereo data becomes available .",
    "this preliminary study does not indicate a significant improvement in gamma - hadron separation using the timing information ; however , this situation may also change when the muon background is removed .",
    "refinements to the simulations , the application of advanced digital signal processing methods and an increased dataset of gamma - ray source observations should all help future studies in this area ."
