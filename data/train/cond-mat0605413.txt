    "in the past few years , ultracold atoms have entered a new regime , where strong correlation effects appear even in extremely dilute gases .",
    "prominent examples for this new area in atomic physics are the study of the crossover from a bcs - type superfluid of extended cooper pairs to a bec of strongly bound molecules @xcite or the realization of a tonks - girardeau gas of hard - core bosons in one - dimensional atomic wires @xcite . in the first case , the strong interaction regime is reached in a direct manner because the scattering length @xmath3 near a feshbach resonance becomes of the same order or even larger than the average interparticle spacing @xmath4 . in the second case",
    ", it is the squeezing of the kinetic energy in an optical lattice which enhances the role of interactions @xcite . a unique role in the context of strongly interacting ultracold gases is played by the so - called unitary fermi gas , where the dimensionless interaction strength parameter @xmath5 is infinite .",
    "this problem was originally discussed in nuclear physics @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "it consists of a two - component fermi gas with a zero range attractive interaction which is just about to bind a state at the two - particle level .",
    "such a situation is realizable with cold gases at a feshbach resonance , where the scattering length diverges @xcite . precisely at this point and for broad feshbach resonances , where the range of the effective interaction is much smaller than the mean interparticle spacing",

    "universal _ function of the ratio @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "while a quantitatively reliable description of the many - body problem near a feshbach resonance at finite temperature is still an open problem @xcite , the situation near zero temperature may be understood in a straightforward manner . indeed , at low temperatures , a two - component fermi gas will be in a superfluid state , independent of the strength of the attractive interaction .",
    "on quite general grounds therefore , the low lying excitations above the ground state are sound modes of the bogoliubov - anderson type , which are the goldstone modes of the broken gauge symmetry in a neutral superfluid . in this regime ,",
    "an effective low energy description is possible in terms of a quantum hydrodynamic approach @xcite . for a fermi gas with a short range attractive",
    "interaction the associated effective field theory was recently discussed by son and wingate @xcite .",
    "starting from a lagrangian formulation of the many - body problem , they realized that in the particular case of a unitary fermi gas , there is an additional conformal symmetry with respect to arbitrary reparametrizations of the time .",
    "remarkably , the effective field theory can be extended to nonequilibrium problems within the framework of linear , irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , conformal invariance of the unitary fermi gas applied to the dissipative part of the stress tensor requires that two of the bulk viscosity coefficients vanish @xcite . as a result",
    ", no entropy is generated in a uniform expansion .",

    "we determine the resulting damping of the breathing mode in a trapped gas and show that its q - factor provides a sensitive measure of temperature in strongly interacting 1d gases .",

    "it approaches @xmath68 in the weak confinement limit , where the dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath69 is identical with the one in free space @xcite .",
    "sufficiently far from the cir , one thus recovers a weakly interacting gas of dimers .    at the many - body level , the situation after the cir is described by a lieb - liniger model @xcite of repulsive bosons .",
    "its dimensionless coupling constant @xmath70 is now positive and vanishes in the weak confinement limit .",
    "it diverges at a value of the 3d scattering length @xmath3 of order @xmath71 . now",
    "although the divergence of @xmath72 does not exactly coincide with that of @xmath48 at the cir @xcite , the range of inverse dimensionless coupling constants where this mismatch appears is of order @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "in the limit @xmath78 , there is thus a continuous evolution from the gaudin - yang model of attractive fermions to the lieb - liniger model of repulsive bosons which completely describes the bcs - bec crossover in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the associated spectrum of elementary excitations is straightforward to understand : in the bcs limit @xmath79 , the system consists of weakly bound cooper pairs .",
    "their breaking is associated with a finite excitation gap and the corresponding spectrum exhibits a relativistic dispersion relation @xmath80 similar to the standard quasiparticle spectrum of the bcs theory .",

    "the energy functional of a one - dimensional quantum liquid needs to be expanded beyond quadratic order in the fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is a crucial advantage of the qhd approach , that the coefficients of the leading nonlinear terms are completely determined by thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",

    "we obtain @xmath109 with the vertex @xmath110 the momentum dependence of the vertex makes perturbation theory applicable for long wavelength phonons .",
    "more precisely , it applies as long as the imaginary part of their energy is much smaller than the real part .",
    "as will be shown below , this requires the phonon wavelength @xmath111 to be much larger than the interparticle spacing on the bcs side of the crossover , while in the bec limit the more resctrictive condition @xmath112 is required .",
    "it should be remarked that an approach to evaluate the nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian via bosonization leads to additional coupling terms between phonons and spin excitations on the bcs side of the crossover which are not accounted for in the qhd approach . as will be shown in the appendix , however",
    ", these terms do not contribute to the phonon damping at long wavelengths .",
    "we evaluate the damping by calculating the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy @xmath113 which is defined as the analytic continuation of the corresponding self - energy @xmath114 in the exact thermodynamic green function @xmath115 here @xmath116 with @xmath117 are the standard bosonic matsubara frequencies .",
    "( we set @xmath118 from now on , except in final results )    the main contribution to the damping rate comes from the three self - energy diagrams shown below , corresponding to spontaneous decay , absorption of a phonon and three wave annihilation .",
    "fmfdiag1    ( 30,25 )    fmfdiag2    ( 30,25 )    fmfdiag3    ( 30,25 )    diagrams of this type have been considered before by andreev @xcite who studied the sound absorption in 1d bose liquids for @xmath119 and by samokhin @xcite in the context of the damping of zero sound in a 1d liquid of repulsive fermions .    after taking the limit @xmath120 and analytic continuation , the retarded self energy @xmath121 is given by the sum of the three diagrams @xmath122 with @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 here @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the usual retarded and advanced green functions respectively .",
    "the combinatorial factor 18 arises from the three possible ways of choosing the creation / annihilation operators for the initial and final phonon and two possibilities of pairing the phonons in between . as was already pointed out by andreev and samokhin , the fact that for linearly dispersing phonons in 1d , momentum- and energy conservation are simultaneously satisfied , requires to go beyond second order perturbation theory which would give an infinite damping rate . following the approach of andreev @xcite",
    ", we calculate the self - energy by using the fact that @xmath128 at long wavelengths .",
    "the precise condition on @xmath129 for which this holds , has to be determined afterwards and will be discussed below .",
    "since we are interested in the quasiparticle pole of @xmath130 we can use the approximation @xmath131 leading to @xmath132 the damping rate of phonons with wavevector @xmath133 can now be determined from the imaginary part @xmath134 of the ( on - shell ) self energy .    starting with the case of zero temperature @xmath21 ,",
    "the only contribution to @xmath135 comes from spontaneus decay ( first diagram ) . applying the approximation ( [ greensfunc ] ) in the integrand and doing the @xmath136- integration",
    ", one ends up with    @xmath137    the major contribution to the integral comes from @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",
    "thus we arrive at the equation @xmath140 for the retarded self energy .",
    "it is solved with a purely imaginary ansatz @xmath141 where @xmath142 at zero temperature , the resulting damping rate @xmath143 of the bogoliubov - anderson mode in one dimension is therefore quadratic in the wavevector .",
    "formally , this is precisely the behaviour of a hydrodynamic mode . it allows to define a zero temperature viscosity @xmath20 by the relation @xmath144 which is completely analogous to sound damping in three dimensions . in that case , @xmath20 is replaced by the combination @xmath145 involving one of the superfluid bulk viscosities @xmath146 and the shear viscosity @xmath18 @xcite and one has @xmath147 at unitarity @xcite . from the result ( [ damp_hom_t0 ] )",
    ", we see that the viscosity at zero temperature has the form @xmath148 with a constant @xmath149 a plot of @xmath150 is given in figure [ fig : alpha0 ] , where the exact result for @xmath151 from the bethe - ansatz solution was used . evidently , the dimensionless viscosity coefficient @xmath150 depends on the inverse coupling constant @xmath83 of the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "it is thus in general dependent on the particle density @xmath75 . at the unitarity point , however , where @xmath152 , this dependence vanishes and @xmath150 takes the universal value @xmath153 which is just @xmath154 of the value @xmath155 attained in the weak coupling limit of the 1d noninteracting fermi gas .",
    "concerning the range of applicability of the perturbative calculation , it is obvious that the approximation leading to ( [ greensfunc ] ) is satisfied for small wavenumbers @xmath156 . based on the explicit result for @xmath20 this condition translates into phonon wavelengths much larger than the mean interparticle spacing on the bcs side of the crossover , including the unitarity point . on the bec side ,",
    "the ratio @xmath157 vanishes like @xmath158 .",
    "the phonon wavelenghts have thus to obey the more restrictive condition @xmath112 mentioned above .",
    "it is interesting to note , that this condition is _ less _ restrictive than the requirement @xmath159 for the validity of the linear dispersion relation @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the 1d healing length .",
    "we now turn to the situation at finite temperature @xmath119 , where the long wavelength phonons , for which @xmath162 , behave classically .",
    "the thermal factor @xmath163 may therefore be replaced by its classical limit @xmath164 . at @xmath165 , the second diagram representing the absorption of another phonon also contributes to the damping .",
    "an explicit calculation along the lines performed at @xmath166 gives a phonon damping rate at finite temperature of the form @xmath167 here @xmath168 is a numerical coefficient defined by the integral @xmath169 as already noted by andreev @xcite , the damping @xmath170 for @xmath171 is not of the standard hydrodynamic form , in contrast to the behaviour at zero temperature .",
    "the quite different results can be understood from the fact that at any finite temperature , the quasi long - range superfluid order present at @xmath21 is destroyed by phase fluctuations on a characteristic length scale @xmath172 .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath173 between this length scale and the phonon wavelength , the behaviour is either essentially superfluid for @xmath174 or normal for @xmath175 .",
    "similar to the formulation used in dynamical scaling laws near critical points @xcite , the crossover between the two different types of behaviour may be described by an ansatz of the form @xmath176 the associated crossover function has the limiting behaviour @xmath177 with the parameter @xmath178 defined in eq .",
    "( [ alphazeta ] ) .",
    "it should be pointed out , that the dependence of the damping rate on temperature is a simple power law @xmath179 only to the extent that the temperature dependence of the velocity @xmath100 itself can be neglected .",

    "finally we extend our results on damping in a homogeneous gas to the experimentally accessible case of a harmonically trapped system , using essentially a local density approximation .",

    "@xcite gives a value of @xmath209 for the universal viscosity coefficient of the 3d unitary fermi gas at the lowest attainable temperatures .",
    "however , it is obvious that a comparison between this and our result in 1d is not meaningful",
    ". nevertheless , the fact that the bogoliubov - anderson mode spectrum and velocity are hardly different between the one and the three dimensional case , suggests that the viscosity in 3d exhibits a similar dependence on the inverse coupling constant @xmath210 . the unitarity point",
    "would then define a minimal value of the viscosity on the _ fermi _ side of the crossover , yet lower viscosities are expected by going further into the bec regime .",
    "it is a peculiar property of the 1d bcs - bec crossover problem , that the boundary between fermionic and bosonic behaviour is sharp and defined by the confinement induced resonance .",
    "a similar sharp separation , however , does not exist in three dimensions .    at finite temperature",
    ", the sound damping in 1d behaves like @xmath211 and thus is not of a hydrodynamic form .",
    "the resulting damping of the breathing mode in a trapped gas has been calculated within a simple model , which accounts for the inhomogeneity in the case of a nonstandard damping .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that in the experimentally relevant regime @xmath212 , the damping increases like @xmath25 , thus providing a sensitive measure of temperature in strongly interacting 1d gases .",
    "experimentally , an attractive fermi gas near a feshbach- and confinement induced resonance has been realized by moritz et al .",
    "since the typical temperatures in this gas were of order @xmath213 with @xmath214 and typical particle numbers are @xmath215 , the condition @xmath212 is realized .",
    "it would be quite interesting therefore , to study the temperature dependence of the breathing mode q - factor similar to the measurements performed in 1d bose gases @xcite . in this context , it is interesting to note that for the tonks - girardeau gas , exact results for the dynamics have been derived at zero temperature by minguzzi and gangardt @xcite . in particular they imply zero damping of the breathing mode at the unitarity point , i.e. an infinite q - factor . from our present results ,",

    "we now use bosonization techniques to construct @xmath218 on the bcs side of the crossover , where spin excitations are present , and show that these terms do not contribute to the damping rate .    in order to obtain damping in the tomonaga - luttinger model",
    ", one needs to to incorporate the quadratic dispersion relation in the hamiltonian , leading to third order terms in the fields as was already shown by haldane for a spinless gas of fermions @xcite .",

    "this factor is important because it prevents @xmath150 and thus the damping from going to infinity in the bec limit .",
    "since the crossover from the bcs to the bec regime is continuous , the damping must also change continuously when one crosses the point of unitarity .",
    "this argument leads us to include this prefactor also in @xmath218 on the bcs side and thus use ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the whole crossover regime .",
