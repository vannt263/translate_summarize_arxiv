    "there has recently been interest in interpreting the cosmological constant in an asymptotically de sitter or anti - de sitter black hole space - time to be a pressure in a thermodynamic sense .",
    "the thermodynamically conjugate variable would then be interpreted as a volume associated to the black hole , though it would not necessarily be related to any notion of geometric volume , @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the idea of varying the cosmological constant goes back to @xcite @xcite , but the interpretation adopted here was first given in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we re - examine some of the known thermodynamics of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) kerr black holes from this perspective , emphasising the role that the pressure plays in the analysis .    as usual in thermodynamics , the phase structure depends on the constraints .",
    "for example when the angular momentum @xmath1 is held fixed there is a critical point with a second order phase transition at finite pressure and temperature , first found in @xcite .",
    "this constant @xmath1 phase transition is known to have mean field exponents , @xcite @xcite , putting it in the same universality class as a van der waals gas and the phase diagram ( figure [ fig : j_free_energy ] ) looks the same as that of a van der waals gas .    on the other hand fixing the angular velocity @xmath2 results in a phase diagram which , like the one dimensional ising model , has no second order transition at any finite temperature .",
    "there is a critical point at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the free energy has a cusp , but the latent heat diverges there .",
    "strictly speaking there is a second critical point , with vanishing latent heat , but it is at infinite @xmath3 and there is no phase transition as one can not pass through this point  this is similar to the @xmath5-d ising model , though there the critical point is at @xmath6 .",
    "the phase structure for constant @xmath2 and constant @xmath1 are different in the the pressure - temperature plane . and",
    "fixed @xmath2 ensembles were analysed in @xcite and @xcite in terms ehrenfest equations . ] in the former case the phase boundary is determined by the condition @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the black hole mass per unit volume , while it is not so easy find an analytic expression for constant @xmath1 .",
    "many familiar notions from ordinary thermodynamics are applicable , such as the clapeyron equation for the slope of the phase boundary in the @xmath0 plane , but there are also significant differences .    while the analysis produces some explicit expressions for phase boundary curves in the @xmath0 plane and latent heats in black hole phase transitions that have not appeared in the literature before , these are not the main point of the paper , being just trivial consequences of the structure of the hawking - page phase transitions .",
    "rather the main point is to emphasise the shift in viewpoint that occurs when the thermodynamic volume is introduced .",
    "the phase diagram in figure [ fig : omega_free_energy ] the same as that of @xcite , but drawn using thermodynamic variables rather than the geometric variables that are explicit in the metric .",
    "this is done to emphasis the physics of the thermodynamics : the free energy is a single valued function of the geometric variables , but is multiple valued in terms of thermodynamic variables , giving the different branches in the @xmath0 plane that are the hallmark of phase transitions in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this conceptual shift may well prove to be important for the analysis of rotating superfluids in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite    in section  [ sec : static ] , static non - rotating black holes are treated , as a warm up for the constant @xmath2 case in  [ sec : omega ] and constant @xmath1 in  [ sec : j ] .",

    "on the other hand , the thermodynamic volume is given by ( [ eq : schwarzschildvolume ] ) .",
    "if @xmath30 the gibbs free energy of the black hole is negative and thus lower than that of anti - de sitter space - time , the former is then the more stable thermodynamic configuration , while for @xmath31 pure anti - de sitter space - time is the more stable and any black hole with @xmath32 will tend to evaporate .",
