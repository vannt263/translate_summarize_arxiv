    "postnikov showed @xcite that the number of hypertrees is proportional to the volume of the root polytope corresponding to @xmath3 . in this paper , we make the following connection .    given an alternating diagram @xmath2 of the link l , the determinant of @xmath1 is equal to    1 .   the number of hypertrees in @xmath3 , 2 .   the number of spanning aroborescences of @xmath4 .",

    "* the author should like to express his gratitude to tams klmn for his constant encouragement and many pieces of helpful advice .",
    "to begin with , we describe a way to obtain a bipartite graph @xmath3 from a knot diagram @xmath2 .",
    "first , construct the universe of @xmath2 ( in the sense of @xcite ) and color it in a checkerboard fashion .",
    "let us call the two colors black and white .",
    "next , put a black vertex in a black region and a white vertex in a white region .",
    "finally , connect the two vertices by an edge @xmath7 if the two regions that have these vertices share an edge @xmath8 of @xmath2 .",
    "in short , we obtain a bipartite graph from a knot diagram by considering the dual graph of the universe .",
    "we put an orientation on @xmath2 so that each edge of @xmath2 has a black vertex on its right side and a white one on the left side .",
    "note that @xmath2 is balanced , i.e. , the number of in - edges is equal to the number of out - edges at each vertex of @xmath2 ( namely , both are @xmath5 ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be a bipartite graph with color classes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , let @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the corresponding standard generators of @xmath15 .",
    "define the root polytope of @xmath3 by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the convex hull .",
    "let @xmath3 be the bipartite graph in the right side of figure  @xmath20 .",
    "since there are @xmath21 edges in @xmath3 , we can plot @xmath21 vertices in five - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "taking the convex hull of these @xmath21 points , we obtain the root polytope shown in figure  3 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a directed graph . fix a vertex @xmath22 of @xmath2 and",
    "call it the root .",
    "a spanning tree in @xmath2 is called a spanning arborescence rooted at @xmath22 if the unique path in the tree from @xmath22 to any other vertex is oriented toward the root .",
    "the number of spanning arborescences is called the arborescence number of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath22 .    according to a combinatorial result @xcite , for any eulerian directed graph @xmath2 ,",
    "the number of spanning arborescences in @xmath2 rooted at @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 , is given by the formula @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of eulerian tours in @xmath2 ( starting from a fixed edge @xmath8 ) and @xmath26 is the set of vertices .",
    "this number equals the number of kauffman states of @xmath2 with fixed stars .",
    "here , a kauffman state is an assignment of one marker per vertex ( see figure  4 ) so that each region in the universe receives no more than one marker . as stated in remark [ markers ] below , we put stars in two adjacent regions and require the starred regions to be free of markers .",
    "these stars should be fixed throughout the argument .",
    "[ markers ] if the number of vertices is @xmath27 , then the number of regions is @xmath28 by an application of euler s formula .",
    "since the number of the regions exceeds the number of vertices by @xmath5 , there are two regions that do not have a marker .",
    "let us remember kauffman s formula for the alexander polynomial . to begin with , suppose that the universe has @xmath27 vertices .",
    "we give labels to the universe at the @xmath30 vertex as shown in figure [ labels ] .",
    "let @xmath35 be a knot with labelled universe @xmath2 and @xmath36 be a kauffman state of @xmath2 .",
    "define an inner product between @xmath2 and @xmath36 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the number of black holes and @xmath39 denotes the label touched by the marker at @xmath40 vertex . here",
    ", black hole is a marker that touches a region @xmath32 in figure  5 .",
    "kauffman s clock theorem @xcite says that any state of @xmath2 can be reached from the so - called clocked state by a sequence of clockwise moves . by the definition of clockwise ( counterclockwise ) moves",
    ", we easily see that each clockwise ( counterclockwise ) move changes the sign @xmath49 of a state by @xmath0 because the number of black holes changes by 1 .",
    "moreover , in case the given knot is alternating , the ratio of the contributions of the labels touched by the two markers to @xmath50 is also @xmath0 . for details ,",
    "see @xcite . putting them together",
    ", we can say that for an alternating link , the inner product of a state with the alexander labeling at @xmath51 is not changed by clock moves .",
    "to connect the determinant and the bipartite graph @xmath54 , we return to root polytopes .",
    "let us recall that a triangulation of the root polytope is a collection of maximal simplices in @xmath18 so that their union is @xmath18 and the intersection of any two simplices is their common face .       in @xcite , a way of triangulating the root polytope by means of spanning arborescences of @xmath2 is introduced .",
    "for example , let us have a look at the spanning arborescence in figure  @xmath61 .",
    "this spanning arborescence has @xmath5 edges . taking the dual of this arborescence",
    ", we obtain a spanning tree of @xmath62 edges .",
    "then the corresponding polytope has @xmath62 vertices as shown in the figure .",
    "for the reason that there are other @xmath5 spanning arborescences , this prism has @xmath5 more corresponding simplices to be triangulated .",
    "arborescences give us one triangulation .",
    "but the number of maximal simplicesin each triangulation of @xmath18 is the same for the simple reason that all eligible simplices have the same volume @xcite .",
    "hence we obtain    let @xmath3 be a plane bipartite graph with color classes @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath63 .",
    "then the number of simplices in each triangulation of the root polytope @xmath18 is the number of spanning arborescences in @xmath4 .           in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the number of the spanning arborescences in @xmath4 is equal to the number of hypertrees in @xmath3 .",
    "putting all things together , we obtain that the number of hypertrees equals the determinant of the link @xmath35 .",
