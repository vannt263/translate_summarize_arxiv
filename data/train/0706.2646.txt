    ".      the standard proof of corollary [ besi - cor ] does not give an explicitly quantitative bound on how quickly @xmath57 decays to zero .",
    "even in the model case of the product cantor set in example [ cantor ] , a non - trivial upper bound on @xmath58 was only established recently in @xcite , who established a bound of the form @xmath59 for some explicit absolute constants @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the inverse tower function @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the @xmath0 iterated logarithm , thus for instance @xmath64 .",
    "this weak bound was strengthened more recently @xcite to @xmath65 for some explicit absolute constants @xmath60 ; in the converse direction , an easy argument establishes the lower bound @xmath66 for some @xmath67 , which is expected to be sharp .",
    "the argument in @xcite also extends to several other model examples of unrectifiable sets , but to the author s knowledge no quantitative version of theorem [ besithm ] in its full generality has appeared in the literature .",
    "this is the main purpose of the current paper ; we will not quite be able attain the type of bounds in ( and certainly not those in ) , but we will obtain some explicit bound nonetheless ( see proposition [ favar ] below ) .",
    "these results are perhaps not so terribly interesting in their own right , but the author hopes that they do illustrate a general point , namely that the qualitative ( and ostensibly ineffective ) arguments coming from infinitary measure theory ( e.g. using the lebesgue differentiation theorem ) can often be converted into quantitative ( but rather weak ) bounds by use of multiscale analysis and the pigeonhole principle ( see below ) .    to achieve these goals , we must first obtain a quantitative version of the unrectifiability hypothesis .",
    "this will be achieved as follows .",
    "[ rec ] let @xmath4 be a set , and let @xmath68 .",
    "we define the _ rectifiability constant _",
    "@xmath69 of @xmath4 with lipschitz constant @xmath70 , error tolerance @xmath71 , and scale @xmath72 to be the quantity @xmath73 where the supremum ranges over all orthonormal @xmath44 , all @xmath37 with lipschitz constant @xmath74 , and all intervals @xmath75 of length at least @xmath72 .",
    "clearly we have the trivial bound @xmath76 .",
    "pure unrectifiability is the assertion that one can improve upon this bound when @xmath77 :    [ unrec ] let @xmath4 be a compact subset of @xmath27 .",

    "now suppose for contradiction that @xmath4 is purely unrectifiable , but that there exists @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that @xmath82 does not converge to zero as @xmath77 .",

    "] , there thus exists orthonormal @xmath87 , functions @xmath88 , and intervals @xmath89 with @xmath90 such that @xmath91 since @xmath4 is compact , we conclude that @xmath92 must be contained in a fixed bounded set ; similarly @xmath93 must take values in a fixed bounded range . by the bolzano - weierstrass theorem",
    "we may thus pass to a subsequence and assume that @xmath92 converges to a fixed interval @xmath94 of length @xmath95 , thus @xmath96 .",
    "similarly we may assume that @xmath97 and @xmath98 for some orthonormal @xmath41 .",
    "by the arzela - ascoli theorem we can also assume that @xmath93 converges uniformly to some @xmath99 , which then has lipschitz norm of at most @xmath70 .",
    "from the compactness of @xmath4 , we see that the set @xmath100 contains the limit superior of the sets @xmath101 in the sense that any point in the interior of @xmath94 which lies in infinitely many of the latter , must also lie in the former . by fubini s theorem",
    "we thus see that the set has positive measure , contradicting pure unrectifiability .",
    "one might now naively hope that a quantitative version of the besicovitch projection theorem would assert that if @xmath4 was an @xmath11-measurable compact set with some bounded spherical ( or hausdorff ) measure and bounded diameter , and if we had some suitable control on the rectifiability constants , then we would obtain an explicit non - trivial upper bound on @xmath102 , which would go to zero as the rectifiability constants went to zero uniformly in @xmath4 .",
    "we do not know how to achieve this , and in fact suspect that such a statement is probably false ( it is somewhat analogous to asking for quantitative bounds on the a.e .",
    "convergence in lebesgue s differentiation theorem @xmath103 which are uniform for all bounded @xmath104 ; such uniform bounds are well known to be impossible ) .",
    "the problem is that a bound @xmath105 on the spherical measure of a set @xmath4 is still partially qualitative ; it asserts that the spherical content @xmath106 is eventually less than @xmath107 , but does not give an effective bound on the scale @xmath108 at which this occurs .",
    "if however we make these scales explicit , we can in fact recover an effective bound , which is the main result of this paper :    we use @xmath109 or @xmath110 to denote the estimate @xmath111 for some absolute constant @xmath112 .",
    "we use @xmath113 to denote the estimates @xmath114 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath115 , and let @xmath1 be a compact subset of the unit ball @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",

    "the point is that we can improve upon this bound by using multiple separated scales , as long as at each scale , @xmath4 is quantitatively unrectifiable relative to the next finer scale .",
    "we remark that the factors of 100 can certainly be lowered ( for instance , one can easily replace these factors with @xmath127 ) but we have exaggerated these constants in order to clarify the argument ( and also because these bounds are in any event extremely poor ) .",
    "we observe that theorem [ main ] easily implies theorem [ besithm ] . indeed , for the latter theorem one can quickly reduce to the case when @xmath4 is compact ( basically because the restriction of spherical measure to @xmath4 is a radon measure , and also because lemma [ aproj ] below allows one to neglect sets of small spherical measure for the purposes of computing favard length ) ; we can then normalise @xmath4 to lie in the unit ball @xmath116 .",

    "we obtain theorem [ besithm ] .",
    "our proof is essentially a finitised version of the one in the book @xcite by mattila , and in particular uses essentially the same geometric ingredients ; we give it in sections [ norm - sec]-[conclude - sec ] .",
    "the main difficulty is to translate the qualitative components of the arguments in @xcite to a quantitative version .",
    "for instance , a fundamental fact in qualitative measure theory is that countably additive measures are continuous from below ; thus if @xmath132 is a measure space and @xmath133 are measurable then @xmath134 . we will rely heavily on the following simple quantitative version of this fact .",

    "observe that any element of @xmath144 belongs to at most @xmath145 sets of the form @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "the claim then follows from the pigeonhole principle .    roughly speaking",
    ", this lemma will allow us to reduce the size of certain exceptional sets by an arbitrary factor @xmath71 , at the cost of reducing the number of available scales by the same factor @xmath71 .",
    "we will generally apply this lemma with @xmath71 equal to some power of @xmath148 , ensuring that there are always plenty , but this only leads to a modest improvement in the final exponents , and also obscures the exposition somewhat , so we have chosen this more conceptually simple approach .",
    "] of scales available .      in order to apply the besicovitch projection theorem ,",
    "one of course needs to verify the hypothesis of unrectifiability ; similarly , in order to apply theorem [ main ] , one needs some non - trivial quantitative decay rate on the rectifiability constants @xmath69 as @xmath77 .",
    "one such tool to achieve the former is the following simple and well - known result , which among other things shows that the product cantor set is purely unrectifiable .",

    "then @xmath4 is purely unrectifiable .",
    "suppose for contradiction that @xmath4 was not purely rectifiable , thus ( after a rotation if necessary ) there exists a lipschitz graph @xmath152 such that the ( compact ) set @xmath153 had positive lebesgue measure . by the lebesgue differentiation theorem ,",

    "it is then not difficult to show that the set @xmath163 has positive measure for all sufficiently small @xmath130 .",
    "but this set is contained in @xmath164 , contradicting the hypothesis .",
    "it is thus natural to ask for a quantitative version of the above proposition . inspecting the above argument",
    ", we see that a proof of such a quantitative version is likely to require some sort of quantitative lebesgue differentiation theorem and a quantitative radamacher differentiation theorem .",
    "this can in fact be done relatively easily , and leads to the following quantitative version :    [ twoproj - quant ] let @xmath165 be a compact set , and let @xmath151 be such that @xmath166 , where @xmath167 denotes the signed angle between two unit vectors .",

    "this simple proof will also serve as a model for the more complicated argument of the same nature used to prove theorem [ main ] .      to illustrate the above theorems",
    ", we return to the cantor set @xmath52 and its approximants @xmath176 described in example [ cantor ] .",

    "the proof of theorem [ twoproj - quant ] is modeled on the proof of proposition [ twoproj ] , but of course with all qualitative statements converted into quantitative ones .",
    "an inspection of that proof reveals three major ingredients : the lebesgue differentiation theorem ( that establishes points of density inside a dense set ) , the radamacher differentiation theorem ( that establishes points of differentiability for a lipschitz function ) , and then a simple observation that the image of a set under a lipschitz function will have positive measure if there exists a point of density of that set for which the lipschitz function is differentiable with non - zero derivative .",

    "it was shown that @xmath562 whenever @xmath187 is compact and connected , @xmath553 ranges over all dyadic squares , @xmath563 is the length of @xmath553 , and @xmath564 is the square with the same centre as @xmath553 but three times the sidelength . in particular , for a lipschitz graph @xmath565 with @xmath566 we see that @xmath567      once again we can rescale @xmath181 . by enlarging @xmath176 to @xmath569",
    "we can also assume @xmath570 .",
    "let @xmath565 be a lipschitz graph with @xmath566 , and let @xmath571 , thus @xmath572 for some closed set @xmath573 .",
    "it then suffices to show that @xmath574 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath45 is large , since the claim is trivial otherwise .",
    "in view of , it thus suffices to show that @xmath575    let @xmath576 .",
    "then @xmath577 consists of @xmath578 dyadic squares of sidelength @xmath579 ; let @xmath580 be the union of all such squares which intersect @xmath4 , thus @xmath581 let @xmath582 , let @xmath583 be one of the squares in @xmath580 , and let @xmath584 be the @xmath585 dyadic squares in @xmath586 of sidelength @xmath587 which are contained in @xmath583 . from elementary geometry",
    "we see that if all @xmath585 of these squares lie in @xmath588 , then @xmath589 .",
    "viewing this contrapositively , we see that if @xmath590 then @xmath591 contains at least one square of sidelength @xmath587 contained in @xmath583 .",
    "summing this fact over all @xmath583 in @xmath580 , we see that @xmath592 a simple counting argument shows that @xmath593 where @xmath594 denotes two - dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "similarly @xmath595 and thus @xmath596 summing in @xmath597 and using telescoping series , we obtain @xmath598 we can directly compute that @xmath599 . also , @xmath600 consists of @xmath601 squares of length @xmath602 , and the intersection of each such square with @xmath4 contributes a set of measure @xmath603 to @xmath29 .",
    "we thus have @xmath604 and the claim follows .    the estimate in proposition [ rector2 ] is significantly stronger than that in proposition [ rector ] , as the former becomes non - trivial as soon as @xmath605 , whereas the latter is only non - trivial for @xmath606 .",
    "however , both estimates , when inserted into theorem [ main ] , give essentially the same result ; replacing proposition [ rector ] by proposition [ rector2 ] allows one to reduce the double - exponential in to single - exponential , but after iteration this only affects the ( unspecified ) implied constant in the final bound for @xmath58 ."
