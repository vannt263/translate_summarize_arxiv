    "there are three stages of the perturbation evolution near a black hole .",
    "the initial black hole outburst from the perturbation source takes place at early times of the evolution . then at late times the damping ( _ quasi - normal _ ) oscillations appear , finally suppressed by power - law or exponential tails at asymptotically late times .",
    "the quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) can be characterized by a set of complex frequencies : real part is the actual oscillation frequency while imaginary part describe the damping rate of the oscillation .",
    "the qnms do not depend on initial perturbations being , thereby , an important characteristic of the black hole .",
    "for this reason , qnms of black holes in asymptotically flat space - time have been extensively studied for more then thirty years ( see reviews @xcite ) . yet",
    "the quasi - normal spectrum of a black hole is crucially dependent on a cosmological background which a black hole is immersed in .",
    "qnms of black holes in de sitter background were considered recent years in @xcite .",
    "despite we live in the de sitter universe , black holes in the background attracted considerable interest due to the famous correspondence @xcite : it is shown that large black holes in ads space - time correspond to approximately thermal states in the dual . according to this correspondence , qnms of a black hole",
    "should coincide with poles of retarded green function of the perturbation in @xmath0 @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory for large @xmath2 and were extensively studied recent years @xcite .",
    "first of all , let us briefly review what is known about perturbations of a scalar field interacting with a black hole .",
    "scalar field is the simplest model , frequently used , when we neglect spin influence @xcite .",
    "also scalar field is used to explain dark matter problem ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact almost all papers which considered scalar field perturbations and corresponding quasi - normal modes were limited by minimal coupling of the scalar field with a black hole , i. e. by consideration of test scalar field propagating in the black hole background @xcite .",
    "further extensions within minimal coupling were made to consider massive scalar field @xcite .",
    "very few papers beyond the minimal coupling are works where perturbations of a black hole with specific form of scalar field called dilaton were considered @xcite , and also perturbations of bocharova - bronnikov - melnikov - bekenstein ( bbmb ) black hole @xcite studied in @xcite .",
    "note however , that bbmb black hole is topologically equivalent to extremal reissner - nordstrm solution and therefore does not provide any unexpected features @xcite .    since the paper of @xcite",
    ", it is well - known that black hole can not have scalar hair within minimal coupling . yet",
    "as recently have been found in @xcite , there is a possibility of dressing a four - dimensional black hole in ads space - time with a non - minimally coupled classical scalar field . in @xcite",
    "the results were extended for higher dimensional configurations .",
    "moreover , fortunately the found solution is stable , thereby allowing us to study its quasi - normal modes .",
    "thus one motivation to undergo this study is to find out what will happen with the ringing behavior of a black hole with scalar hairs , another aim is rather technical : for the above black hole perturbations the problem is reduced to wave - like equations but with effective potential which is not known in analytical form , but expressed in terms of unknown functions obeying some differential equations .    this is the case of many physically relevant situations such as dirty black holes ( i. e. with some distribution of matter around them ) , black holes with massive dilaton , evaporating black holes and other objects determined by a set of equations that can not be solved analytically .",
    "we hope therefore that the way we are considering quasi - normal spectrum here may be of some use in those cases .",
    "the other interesting issue is related to arbitrary long living modes ( in linear approximation ) which were called quasi - resonances .",
    "they appear when perturbing massive scalar @xcite or vector @xcite fields near a black hole of a specific mass . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , that quasi - resonances are permitted for black holes immersed in asymptotically flat background and are not permitted for asymptotically de sitter space - times .",
    "we show that anti - de sitter boundary conditions do not permit quasi - resonances too ( see the appendix ) .",
    "our numerical investigations confirm this statement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ basic ] we review briefly @xcite to introduce the hairy black hole and the perturbation equation near it . in section [ calc ]",
    "we describe the method we used for our calculations . and",
    "finally , in section [ results ] we make some comments about the results .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric solution @xmath3 of the action , which describes a self - interacting scalar field @xmath4 with non - minimal coupling to gravity : @xmath5 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar , @xmath7 is the cosmological constant , @xmath8 is the coupling constant , @xmath9 is the massive scalar field self - interaction potential and @xmath10",
    ".    in @xcite stability of the non - trivial solution has been proven for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in @xcite some arguments for its stability for @xmath14 are given and the stability is proven for the particular case of @xmath15 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the above range of the parameters and our results support stability of the solution within linear perturbatuon approach .",
    "it is convenient for our purposes to use conformal transformation in this region to simplify the equations of motion : @xmath16    after the transformation the action takes the form : @xmath17 where we define @xmath18    the metric takes the following form @xmath19 where @xmath20    varying the action one can find the equations @xcite : @xmath21    in order to obtain the explicit form of ( [ conf_trans_metric ] ) we have to solve the equations with some boundary conditions that are associated with the black hole parameters .",
    "we are using the following parameters .",
    "the event horizon radius @xmath22 can be chosen arbitrary in order to fix length scale and defines boundary condition for @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "we measure all dimensional units in units of @xmath25 , thus we choose @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 can be also chosen arbitrary to fix time scale . in order to introduce the boundary conditions in the same point we choose @xmath28 as distinct from winstanley s @xmath29 . and",
    "the last parameter @xmath30 can be associated with the scalar charge of the black hole .",
    "spherically symmetric perturbation equation for @xmath31 takes the schrdinger wave - like form : @xmath32 where the perturbation potential @xmath33 is given by @xcite : @xmath34 @xmath35 is tortoise coordinate given by @xmath36 and similar to ordinal anti - de sitter case : @xmath37",
    "this perturbation corresponds to infinitesimal changing of the black hole mass and is similar to the zero - multipole scalar perturbations near a hairless black hole .",
    "the crucial difference is that the perturbation of a scalar field due to the hair gives a first - order correction to the metric .",
    "quasi - normal modes can be defined as eigenvalues of ( [ perturbed ] ) with the boundary conditions which require ingoing wave at the event horizon and zero at spatial infinity .",
    "these boundary conditions are natural and mean that the black hole does not emit radiation and our solution is not divergent .",
    "these specific boundary conditions allow us to fix the one of the two independent solutions in both points and calculate eigenvalues by comparing series near each of them .",
    "this technique is the base for two main precise methods of numerical calculation of qnms : the continued fraction method @xcite and the horowitz - hubeny method @xcite .",
    "they both were extensively used to find eigenfrequencies of perturbation equations with potential given analytically as polynomial fraction .",
    "fortunately horowitz - hubeny method is possible to be adopted for equations with unknown potential .",
    "indeed if the potential @xmath33 would be polynomial fraction we could eliminate singularity at the horizon introducing new function @xmath38 where @xmath39 is chosen to make @xmath40 regular at the horizon @xmath41 .",
    "the requirement for @xmath40 to be regular at the horizon fixes that independent solution which satisfies the horizon boundary condition . to use the other boundary condition one needs to find an equation for @xmath40 in the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are polynomial functions . using explicit form of the polynoms : @xmath46",
    "it is easy to find series expansion for @xmath47 ( we suppose that there is no singularities in the circle @xmath48 , if singularities appear one needs to use another definition of @xmath49 to avoid them ) :    @xmath50    and find @xmath51 by minimizing @xmath52 restricted by some large number @xmath2 of expansion terms in ( [ yserie ] ) .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are series and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 converge quickly enough @xmath56 is still possible to calculate because it depends insignificantly on higher terms of the series .",
    "thus we use the following procedure of the qnms calculation .",
    "we introduce @xmath57 that is finite in the region outside black hole @xmath58 . using ( [ perturbed ] )",
    "we express @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 and find that @xmath62 .    from ( [ mine1 ] , [ mine2 ] , [ mincscal ] ) we calculate for given black hole parameters the first @xmath63 coefficients in the series expansions for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "then for each given @xmath51 we find the first @xmath64 coefficients of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 and using ( [ yserie ] ) the first @xmath65 terms of @xmath40 . and , finally , we minimize @xmath52 with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "we increase @xmath64 and @xmath2 for every given @xmath64 until the value of @xmath51 stops changing within required precision .",
    "if we find finite @xmath64 and @xmath2 for a given precision of @xmath51 , we believe that the procedure converges and the @xmath51 is eigenvalue of ( [ perturbed ] ) .",
    "to control convergence of the procedure we used the simplest minimization method : we start from some initial value of @xmath51 and calculate @xmath66 for this value , then we change @xmath51 by small value and calculate @xmath66 for it doing so while its modulus is decreasing , after that we decrease the small value and repeat the procedure until the required precision is reached .    obviously ,",
    "the series @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are definite up to an arbitrary finite function . since we require quick convergence of them the selection of such function can greatly decrease @xmath64 and @xmath2 and therefore the calculation time .",
    "we used @xmath67 factor for this purpose .",
    "( the complete procedure of the qnms searching written in mathematica is available from the author upon request . )",
    "as were noticed above the method is appropriate only if equation ( [ exp_eq ] ) has no singular points in the circle @xmath48 . as long as functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are known only as series we can not be sure that it is true within our approach .",
    "we believe that it is true because our results are stable against small changing of any of free parameters .",
    "if the equation had singularities in the unit circle we would obtain random results that do not approximate a smooth curve .",
    "unfortunately we have no results to compare with ours because the hairy black hole is found as non - trivial solution of non - minimally coupled scalar field to gravity and has no studied limit to compare .",
    "therefore calculation with an alternative method would be welcome to check the obtained results .    taking into account these",
    "argues we restricted our calculations to fundamental modes though the method allows to find higher ones that are presented for particular values of the parameters ( see figure [ nfig ] ) .",
    "one can see that higher overtones tend to equidistant spacing similar to hairless black hole spectrum behavior in ads @xcite . yet",
    "fundamental modes give us a qualitative picture of quasi - normal spectrum depending on the free parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( we measure all quantities in @xmath22 units ) .",
    "imaginary part demonstrates the most predictable behavior .",
    "it changes monotonously with respect to @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "scalar field mass cause imaginary part to increase but not to vanish .",
    "it reaches a maximum for some particular mass and then decrease very rapidly ( see figure [ mufig ] ) .",
    "thus no infinitely long living oscillations appear .",
    "this fact is not unexpected and seems to be general for all black holes in the asymptotically anti - de sitter background .",
    "real part has more complicated behavior and depends significantly on the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see figures [ qfig ] and [ lfig ] ) .",
    "other parameters @xmath68 and @xmath71 change the real part within the comparable small bounds ( figures [ xifig ] and [ mufig ] ) . for relatively large values of @xmath68 , @xmath70 , @xmath69",
    "purely imaginary frequencies appear .",
    "also we did not find any growing modes ( with positive imaginary part ) that supports stability of such hairy black holes .",
    "in @xcite was shown that the existence of purely real quasi - normal modes ( quasi - resonances ) of massive scalar field near schwarzschild black hole is due to specific boundary conditions at spatial infinity for the case of asymptotically flat space - time .",
    "it was explained also why there is no quasi - resonances of massive scalar field in the asymptotically de sitter background if the potential is zero at both the horizons .",
    "though the potential kind and the boundary conditions for asymptotically anti - de sitter space - time are different one can show similarly that no quasi - resonances can appear in this background too .",
    "indeed , suppose @xmath51 is real and consider an imaginary part of the integral of ( [ perturbed ] ) : @xmath72 is real # 1(#1 ) @xmath73    since we require dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity and by definition @xmath74 , @xmath75 is finite . indeed convergence of ( [ yexp ] ) at spatial infinity implies that @xmath76 where @xmath77 can be expressed in terms of @xmath56 and thus @xmath78 .",
    "therefore @xmath79 that is impossible because @xmath80 leads to trivial solution .",
    "thus we prove that there can be no quasi - resonances .",
