    "the matrix @xmath8 is the `` centered '' linear galerkin tensor : @xmath9 let @xmath10 be a lyapunov candidate function : @xmath11 that is locally positive definite , i.e. @xmath12 , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 being a neighborhood region around @xmath15 .",
    "this lyapunov function is related to the turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) of the flow @xmath16 .",
    "the time derivative of v is : @xmath17 for a large class of boundary conditions the quadratic term can be shown to be energy - preserving ( i.e. @xmath18 ) and therefore , does not contribute to the time derivative of @xmath10  @xcite .",

    "_ lyapunov stable _ if the hermitian part @xmath20 vanishes , i.e. @xmath25 .    in this work , primary interest is high - reynolds - number flows and thus , the only physically representative stability characteristic is lyapunov stability .",
    "the basis idea of the proposed approach is to search for a set of fluid modes that provide a lyapunov stable galerkin dynamical system .",
    "this can be accomplished via the generalized galerkin approximation first introduced in  @xcite and summarized in the following section .      in the generalized galerkin model approximation ,",
    "the velocity field of the flow is approximated by expansion modes @xmath26 that are linear superpositions of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) pod modes .",

    "the new modes are expected to capture a lower proportion of the turbulent kinetic energy compared to the optimal pod modes .",
    "this loss of optimality is quantified by the optimality ratio @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the pod eigenvalues and @xmath41 are the eigenvalues associated with the new modes .",

    "several implementation details are worthy of mention . first , although the jacobian can approximated using finite - differences , this requires @xmath60 evaluations of @xmath61 . for large modes these evaluations are computationally prohibitive .",
    "instead , the jacobian is approximated using an surrogate function @xmath62 .",
    "the surrogate function outputs the hermitian part of the _ uncentered _ galerkin tensor @xmath54 .",
    "this approximation significantly decreases computational costs and , for the specific flow configurations tested here , does not significantly effect convergence properties .",
    "secondly , the method introduced in this paper does not guaranteed existence of solutions , i.e. @xmath47 . however",
    ", numerical experiments summarized in this paper suggest that a rule of thumb of @xmath63 yields solutions and good overall performance . finally , the proposed algorithm assumes that the provided quadratic galerkin tensor @xmath64 is energy preserving , i.e. @xmath65",
    "in this section the proposed approach is demonstrated on two prototypical flow configuration : a two - dimensional mixing layer , and two - dimensional flow inside a lid - driven cavity .",

    "a total of @xmath77 pod modes are derived from this database .      both flow configuration",
    "are approximated using two , @xmath84 galerkin models .",
    "the first model corresponds to a standard pod - galerkin model using the first @xmath85 most energetic pod modes .",

    "the optimality ratio @xmath87 between the new modes and the pod modes is @xmath88 for the mixing layer and @xmath89 for the lid - driven cavity .",

    "the resulting modes are guaranteed to remain bounded for all time in the neighbourhood of the lyapunov stable fixed point .",
    "the results presented in this paper are surprising for several reasons .",
    "first , solutions are demonstrated to exist for a wide range of reynolds number ; @xmath91 for the mixing layer and @xmath79 for the driven cavity .",
    "second , the trajectories of the derived models accurately approximate the dynamics of the the navier - stokes attractor .",
    "this is especially surprising given the small size of the models .",
    "several opportunities for future work are summarized here .",
    "+ the derived lyapunov stable galerkin models constitute energy - conservative approximations of the intrinsically dissipative navier - stokes attractor .",
    "this property can be viewed as both a weakness and a strength of the proposed approach .",
    "it is a weakness because the derived models can not be expected to perform well off the attractor .",
    "the models simply inherit the energy of the initial condition for all time . on the other hand , this property is a strength because it opens the possibility of augmenting the conservative models with a empirical dissipative term .",
    "for example , the centered galerkin model can be augmented as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the energy on the attractor and @xmath94 is the instantaneous energy . the free parameters @xmath95 can be tuned empirically to match the desired overall dissipation .",
    "most importantly , once the trajectories return to the attractor the extra empirical term vanishes and the unmodified galerkin model is recovered . +",
    "the proposed approach operates on the level of the galerkin dynamical system , i.e. the quadratic odes derived via a galerkin projection of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "therefore , since only the galerkin tensors are required , the approach is independent of the algorithm used to derive the fluid modes .",
    "pod modes were used in this work but other algorithms such as dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd ) could be utilized . +",
    "another opportunity for future work involves weakening the condition of vanishing hermitian . instead of searching for a conservative model , a non - conservative model",
    "would be identified that best fits the data .",
    "this would involve a search for @xmath33 such that the distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath23 yields an accurate and dissipative galerkin model of the navier - stokes attractor . since pod modes are biased toward the energy containing scales of the flow",
    ", the approach would involve decreasing the magnitude of positive eigenvalues of @xmath23 and increasing the magnitude of negative eigenvalues .",
    "more generally , the method could be modified to search for monotonically attracting trapping regions introduced by  @xcite . +",
    "a final opportunity for future work involves modifying the proposed approach to a constrained minimization problem .",
    "in addition to providing lyapunov stable models , the goal would be to find modes that are as close as possible to the optimal pod modes : @xmath96",
    "the author is particularly grateful to bernd noack from the institute pprime , and guillame daviller from cerfacs for making available the mixing layer data set .",
    "the following is a simple matlab implementation of the proposed approach . for the sake of clarity , several global variables",
    "are utilized and these must be defined and present in the workspace .",
    "specifically , the pod galerkin tensors are required in the following format : ` c_star(i ) `  @xmath97 , ` l_star(i , j ) `  @xmath98 and ` q_star{i}(j , k ) `  @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
