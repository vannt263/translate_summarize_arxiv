    "with the proliferation of broadband access technologies such as ethernet , dsl , wimax and ieee 802.11a / b / g , portable devices tend to possess multiple modes of connecting to the internet .",
    "most pdas provide both cellular and wlan connectivity ; laptops are typically equipped with a built - in ethernet port , an 802.11a / b / g card and a phone jack for dial - up connections . since",
    "a multitude of access technologies will continue to co - exist , increasing efforts are devoted to the standardization of architectures for network convergence .",
    "integration of heterogeneous access networks has been a major consideration in the design of 4 g networks  @xcite , ieee 802.21  @xcite , and the ip multimedia subsystem  ( ims ) platform  @xcite .",
    "in addition , multi - homed internet access presents an attractive option from an end - host s perspective . by pooling resources of multiple simultaneously available access networks , it is possible to support applications with higher aggregate throughput , lower latency , and better error resiliency  @xcite .",
    "+ in many applications , each end - host or device needs to simultaneously support multiple application flows with heterogeneous bit rate and latency requirements .",
    "one can easily imagine a corporate user participating in a video conference call , while uploading some relevant files to a remote server and browsing web pages for reference . in the presence of many such users , each access network can easily become congested with multiple competing application flows from multiple devices .",
    "the problem of resource allocation arises naturally , for determining the source rate of each application flow , and for distributing the traffic among multiple simultaneously available access networks . in this work ,",
    "we focus on video streaming applications as they impose the most demanding rate and latency requirements .",
    "flows from other applications , such as web browsing and file transfer , are treated as background traffic .",
    "+ challenges in the design of a rate allocation policy for such a system are multi - fold .",
    "firstly , access networks differ in their attributes such as available bit rates ( abrs ) and round trip times ( rtts ) , which are time - varying in nature .",
    "secondly , video streaming applications differ in their latency requirements and distortion - rate  ( dr ) characteristics .",
    "for instance , a high - definition  ( hd ) video sequence containing dynamic scenes from an action movie requires much higher data rate to achieve the same quality as a static head - and - shoulder news clip for a mobile device .",
    "thirdly , unlike file transfer or web browsing , video streaming applications require timely delivery of each packet to ensure continuous media playout .",
    "late packets are typically discarded at the receiver , causing drastic quality degradation of the received video due to error propagation at the decoder .",
    "in addition , the rate allocation policy should also operate in a distributed manner to avoid the traffic overhead and additional delay in collecting global media and network information for centralized computation .",
    "+ this paper addresses the above considerations , and investigates a suite of distributed rate allocation policies for multi - homed video streaming over heterogeneous access networks :    * _ media - aware allocation _ : when devices have information of both video dr characteristics and network abr / rtt attributes , we formulate the rate allocation problem in a convex optimization framework and minimize the sum of expected distortions of all participating streams . a distributed approximation to the optimization",
    "is presented , to enable autonomous rate allocation at each device in a media- and network - aware fashion . * _ h@xmath0-optimal control _ :",
    "in the case where media - specific information is not available to the devices , we propose a scheme based on h@xmath0-optimal control  @xcite .",
    "the scheme achieves optimal bandwidth utilization on all access networks by guaranteing a worst - case performance bound characterizing deviation from full network utilization and excessive fluctuations in allocated video rates . * _ aimd - based heuristic _ :",
    "for comparison , we present two heuristic rate allocation schemes that react to congestion in the network by adjusting the total rate of each stream following tcp - style additive - increase - multiplicative - decrease ( aimd ) principle  @xcite . they differ in their manners of how rates are split among multiple access networks in accordance with observed abrs .",
    "performance of all four rate allocation policies are evaluated in ` ns-2 `  @xcite , using abr and rtt traces collected from ethernet , ieee 802.11b and ieee 802.11 g networks in a corporate environment .",
    "simulation results are presented for the scenario of simultaneous streaming of multiple high - definition  ( hd ) video sequences over multiple access networks .",
    "we verify that the proposed distributed media - aware allocation scheme approximates the results from centralized computation closely .",
    "the allocation results react quickly to abrupt changes in the network , such as arrival or departure of other video streams .",
    "both media - aware allocation and h@xmath0-optimal control schemes achieve significantly lower packet delivery delays and loss ratios ( less than 0.1% for media - aware allocation and below 2.0% for h@xmath0-optimal control ) , whereas aimd - based schemes incur up to 45% losses , far exceeding the tolerance level of video streaming applications . as a result",
    ", media - aware allocation improves the average received video quality by 1.5  -  10.7  db in psnr over the heuristic schemes in various simulation settings .",
    "it further ensures equal utilization across all access networks and more balanced video quality among all streams .",

    "a flow scheduling framework is presented for collaborative internet access , based on modeling and analysis of individual end - hosts traffic behavior .",
    "the framework mainly accounts for tcp flows and uses metrics useful for web traffic including rtt and throughput for making scheduling decisions .",

    "their rate control algorithm is based on tfrc and is oblivious of the media content . in @xcite ,",
    "media - aware rate allocation is achieved , by taking into account the impact of both packet loss ratios and available bandwidth over each link , on the end - to - end video quality of a single stream , whereas in @xcite , the rate allocation problem has been formulated for multiple streams sharing one wireless network . unlike our recent work where the multi - stream multi - network rate allocation problem is addressed from the perspective of stochastic control of markov decision processes  @xcite and robust h@xmath0-optimal control of linear dynamic systems  @xcite@xcite , in this paper we stay within the convex optimization framework for media - aware optimal rate allocation , and compare the performance of the scheme with prior approaches .",

    "that video dr characteristics are unavailable , we resort to a formulation of h@xmath0-optimal control in section  [ subsec : hinfinity ] , which dynamically adjusts the allocated rate of each stream according to fluctuations in observed network available bandwidth . for comparison , we include in section  [ subsec : aimd ] two heuristic allocation schemes following tcp - style additive - increase - multiplicative - decrease  ( aimd ) principle .",

    "future extensions to the current work include investigation of measures to best allocate network resources among different traffic types ( e.g. , web browsing vs. video streaming ) and to reconcile their different performance metrics ( e.g. , web page refresh time vs. video quality ) as functions of their allocated rates .",
