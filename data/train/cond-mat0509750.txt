    "magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) have gained considerable interest in recent years due to their high potential in various applications , e.g. as reads heads @xcite , angle @xcite or strain sensors @xcite and as programmable resistance in data storage ( mram ) @xcite or even magnetic logic devices @xcite .",
    ".,width=264 ]    the underlaying concept is a spin valve consisting of a hard magnetic reference electrode separated from the soft magnetic sense or storage layer by a tunnel barrier like al@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the reference layer usually is an artificial ferrimagnet ( afi ) exchange biased by a natural antiferromagnet , in which the afi consists of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiparallel via a thin non - magnetic spacer . for the soft electrode ,",
    "mostly single layers of polycrystalline material , e.g nife and cofe , have been used @xcite . recently , soft electrodes of polycrystalline afis , based on ferromagnetic materials like cofe and nife , have been investigated .",
    "they show a further reduction of the stray field due to the reduced net moment , smaller switching field distribution @xcite and an easier establishment of a single domain structure in patterned elements with small aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "additionally , the concept of an afi allows one to further adjust the magnetic properties of the soft layer .",
    "compared to the coercivity of a continuous single layer , @xmath3 , the coercivity of the afi , @xmath4 , is enhanced by a factor @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the saturation magnetization and the thickness of the two composite ferromagnetic layers.@xcite as shown before for unpatterned afi films consisting of two amorphous , ferromagnetic cofeb layers , separated by a thin ru spacer , the coercivity can be tailored in a wide range and is approximately by a factor of nine smaller than in systems of polycrystalline cofe / ru / cofe.@xcite furthermore the coupling of the amorphous cofeb - afi shows an oscillating behavior in dependence of the thickness of the nonmagnetic ru spacer and achieves a coupling strength of the order of @xmath9 at the second antiferromagnetic maximum , which is about a factor of ten smaller than in polycrystalline cofe / ru / cofe trilayers.@xcite    it was the purpose of this study to investigate the switching behavior of the amorphous cofeb - afi at sub-@xmath0 m sizes , where additional shape anisotropy and the magnetostatic edge coupling have to be taken into account .",
    "these contributions lead to an _ effective anisotropy _ which is for patterned elements different from the anisotropy of continuous films ( eqn .",

    "the afi was grown on a 1.2 nm thick al layer , oxidized in an ar / o@xmath13 plasma for 0.8 min without breaking the vacuum , to have similar growth conditions as in a mtj . in order to investigate the switching behavior in dependence on the q - value ,",
    "three different samples have been prepared where the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer in contact with the al@xmath1o@xmath2 layer , and thus the net magnetic moment , has been varied ( see table [ tab : table ] , samples a to c ) .",
    "additional a single cofeb layers with a thickness of 4 nm ( sample d ) has been deposited for comparison .",
    "all samples were capped with a ta layer to protect the multilayers from oxidation .",
    "the samples have been patterned by a single step e - beam lithography and ar - ion etching process . for lithography",
    "a positive e - beam resist was used , leading to patterns with a small edge roughness and high reproducibility across the whole array . on each sample different arrays of ellipses with a nominal width , @xmath14 , of 250 nm and varying length , @xmath15 , have been defined , leading to different aspect ratios , @xmath16 , between 1.3 and 8 .",
    "the lateral distances have been chosen three times the dimension of the elements , and therefore a dipolar coupling between the individual ellipses of an array can be neglected.@xcite each of the arrays had the dimension of @xmath17 .",
    "after the arrays have been coated by a ta layer of appropriate thickness ( ranging from 8 to 15 nm ) , the capping was removed in a lift - off process in a bath of solvent under application of ultrasonic agitation . during etching with a 80 @xmath18 ar ion current",
    "the samples were tilted by approximately 30 degrees and rotated to obtain a uniform etch profile over the sample .",
    "the etching depth was monitored by a secondary ion mass spectrometer ( sims ) attached to the etching facility .",
    "the sizes and the uniformity of all patterns have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) after the patterning process .",
    "the sem image in figure [ fig : sem ] shows one of the arrays of sample d with ellipses in the size of @xmath19 , confirming the high uniformity of the patterns .",
    "the width for samples with small aspect ratios ( @xmath20 ) varied between 250 and 270 nm . due to a tendency of over - exposure , ellipses with larger aspect ratios show a slightly larger widths of approximately 300 nm .",

    "magnetization loops of all arrays have been taken by a commercial magneto - optical kerr effect magnetometer ( moke ) with a typical spot diameter of 4@xmath0m.@xcite    , and the plateau field , @xmath23 , are indicated for sample a.,width=302 ]",
    "a room temperature magnetization curve , @xmath24 , of the antiferromagnetically ( af ) coupled systems is shown in figure [ fig : agmloops ] . from the @xmath24 loops , obtained by alternating gradient field magnetometery ( agm )",
    ", one can extract the saturation field , @xmath25 , the total , @xmath26 , and the net magnetic moment , @xmath27 , allowing to calculate the measured q - value , @xmath28 , the individual magnetization of the layers , @xmath29 , and the coupling energy @xcite @xmath30 the coupling is @xmath31 for all investigated afi samples .",
    "the values are in accordance to the oscillating coupling in dependence on the ru spacer thickness around the second antiferromagnetic maximum as presented elsewhere.@xcite the measured q - values vary between 3.7 and 7.7 for the investigated afi samples , and are significantly smaller than the @xmath5 value , @xmath32 , calculated from the nominal thickness of the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "this discrepancy is supposed to result from a thicker magnetically dead layer of the upper cofeb layer in comparison to the bottom layer . since the samples are well protected from oxidation , as confirmed by auger depth profiling",
    ", this would indicate a stronger intermixing of the upper cofeb interfaces .",
    "all data extracted from the agm measurements are given in table [ tab : table ] .",
    "figure [ fig : majorloopspatterned ] shows the magnetization loops of patterned arrays of all afi samples as obtained by moke measurements .",
    "the strong af coupling is maintained after the patterning and annealing steps .",
    "additionally , the saturation field is increasing with decreasing aspect ratio ( i.e. length or size ) of the ellipses , due to an increase in stray field coupling between the layers within the afi system . for large aspect ratios @xmath25 achieves the values of the unpatterned samples .",
    "the saturation field can be expressed by two contributions , one originating from the antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling , the other resulting from the stray field coupling . whereas the first should depend on @xmath33 , as derived from eqn .",
    "[ coupling ] , the latter should depend on @xmath34,@xcite where @xmath35 is the total thickness of the afi .",
    "the second contribution only depends on the demagnetization factor @xmath36 , since the @xmath37-components in case of an af coupled system are compensated for external fields larger than the plateau field , @xmath23 .",
    "since the width of the elements was hold constant for the investigated samples , the dependence of @xmath25 on the sample geometry is only given by the demagnetization factor@xcite @xmath38    this model is fitted to the measured data as shown in figure [ fig : hsathc](a ) .",
    "the fitting shows a high accordance between the experimental data and the model , thus verifying the dependence of the saturation field on @xmath39 for small aspect ratios . from the fitting parameters one",
    "can further extract the saturation field for an infinite elongated ellipse to 28.6 ka / m for sample a , 24.2 ka / m for sample b and 22.8",
    "ka / m for sample c , respectively .",
    "this values are in good agreement to the measured saturation fields at the unpatterned afi samples given by the interlayer coupling ( see table [ tab : table ] ) .     for all samples.,width=264 ]    for external fields smaller than @xmath23 , the af coupling remains stable . as can be seen from figure [ fig : majorloopspatterned ] , the afi should reverse its magnetization like a single layer sample with a reduced net moment and enhanced effective anisotropy",
    ". therefore it is possible to measure minor magnetization loops in a small field window ( @xmath40 to @xmath41 ka / m , depending on @xmath23 of the sample ) and extract the coercivity , @xmath42 , of the arrays ( see figure [ fig : hsathc](b ) ) .    , and ( b ) coercivity , h@xmath43 , of patterned samples vs. the aspect ratio @xmath44 .",
    "the width of approximately 250 to 270 nm was kept constant for all investigated samples .",
    "the dashed lines in ( a ) represent a fit with a function proportional to the demagnetization factor @xmath39 .",
    "( c ) numerical calculated demagnetization factors for ellipses against the aspect ratio.,width=302 ]    for small aspect ratios ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath42 increases with @xmath46 by approximately 3.5 ka / m and remains constant for large aspect ratios ( see figure [ fig : hsathc](b ) ) .",
    "the slight decrease in coercivity for the largest aspect ratios is most likely attributed to the slightly larger width of the ellipses .",
    "this behavior of the coercivity vs. aspect ratio holds also for the single layer sample .",
    "the increase of @xmath42 for small aspect ratios is caused by the increase in shape anisotropy , which for an ellipse is given by@xcite @xmath47 where the demagnetization factor ( @xmath48 ) depends on the aspect ratio .",
    "therefore the experimental results of figure [ fig : hsathc ] ( b ) are in qualitative accordance with the ( @xmath48 ) dependence on aspect ratio ( see figure [ fig : hsathc](c ) )",
    ". deviations from the calculated dependence for large aspect ratios are likely to result from micromagnetic differences : small elements are stabilized by a non vanishing stray field , arising from the magnetic poles of the elements .",
    "these stray fields stabilize the overall magnetization of the elements , so that the reversal can be more accurately approximated by a single domain mechanism . for large aspect ratios",
    "the magnetic poles are larger separated , thus minimizing the stray field coupling and as a result a nucleation driven magnetization reversal , most likely initiated by edge domains , is more favourable , leading to a almost constant coercivity.@xcite    unlike elliptic elements with a single ferromagnetic layer , the coercivity of the patterned afi samples does not scale proportional to the net magnetic moment . with higher net moment",
    ", the coercivity is _ decreasing _ , but remaining always larger than for elements of a 4 nm thick single layer .",
    "the reason is a superposition of the effective anisotropy due to the af coupling ( @xmath49 ) , as expressed by eqn .",
    "[ qvalue ] for the unpatterned films , and the dependence of coercivity on the net magnetic moment as described by eqn .",
    "[ sun ] ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "overall the influence of the af coupling is dominating for the investigated cofeb afis and the coercivity is increased by approximately a factor of 1.4 when decreasing the net thickness of the afi , and therefore the net moment , from 1.5 to 0.5 nm .",
    ", on the net thickness , @xmath51 , of the afi and a single layer , respectively .",
    "the experimental data points are for elliptical shaped elements with the dimension of @xmath52 , the simulated data are evaluated for the same sample geometry .",
    "lines are guides to the eye.,width=264 ]    the dependence of coercivity on the net thickness , @xmath53 , of the afi and for single layer samples with layer thicknesses of @xmath54 have been simulated within a micromagnetic model using landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations ( see figure [ fig : simulation]).@xcite for the simulation of the afis the thickness of the second fm layer , @xmath55 , was varied between 3.5 and 6 nm , whereas the thickness of the first fm layer was kept fixed to @xmath56 , and the thickness of the nonmagnetic spacer was chosen to 1 nm . the saturation moment of the fm layers were assumed to @xmath57 , the uniaxial anisotropy to @xmath58 , the exchange stiffness constant to @xmath59 and for the af coupling constant to @xmath60 .",
    "the coercivity of the simulated elliptic afi elements of @xmath52 decreases with net thickness for @xmath61 nm , and increases for larger @xmath62 , asymptotically reaching the values of the single layer coercivity .",
    "the experimental data of the afi arrays with the same geometry show a similiar behavior , therefore verifying the above described model for the samples under study .",
    ", illustrating also the gain in effective anisotropy by introduction of the antiferromagnetic coupling and the strong influence of the increased q - value on the anisotropy of the system.,width=325 ]    figure [ fig : asteroids ] shows the bias field dependence of the coercivity for samples patterned with an aspect ratio of @xmath63 . due to the increase of",
    "effective anisotropy with the q - value ( and therefore basically with the inverse net magnetic moment ) , the asteroid gets stretched along the hard axis field .",
    "if used in a conventional writing scheme as a soft magnetic electrode for applications like mram or magnetic logic , the broad asteroid shape of the afi storage layer cells limits the choice of q - value due to field limitations , reducing the proposed advantages of an afi structure as reported by others.@xcite",
    "the afi based on an amorphous cofeb alloy shows a strong increase in the effective ansiotropy due to the af coupling , mediated by a thin ru interlayer and by the stray field coupling , respectively .",
    "this is reflected by a higher coercivity and an increase of the asteroid width compared to a single cofeb layer .",
    "the dependence of the switching field on the net magnetic moment can not be explicitely explained within the model that considers the afi as a rigid ferromagnetic layer with a reduced moment .",
    "one has further to take into account the increase of effective anisotropy , which basically scales with the inverse net moment for the investigated combinations of layer thicknesses .",
    "this last factor appears to be dominating in the system under study and leads to the decrease of coercivity with net moment .",
    "finally , it has been found , that the saturation field of the patterned afis is decreasing with larger aspect ratio and is asymptotically reaching the saturation field of the unpatterned films . the origin for this behavior for small aspect ratios can be found in the additional contribution of the stray field coupling of the two ferromagnetic layers within the afi .",
    "therefore the antiparallel alignment of the system is additionally favoured by the stray field coupling , depending basically on the demagnetization factor @xmath39 vs. aspect ratio .",
