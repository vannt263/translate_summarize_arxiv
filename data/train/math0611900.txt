    "the classical knot theory is the theory of tame embeddings of the circle into the 3-space , which has become a central topic in mathematics .",
    "the classical theory of knots has many generalizations and variations : from the circle to graphs , from the circle to higher dimensional spheres , from tame embeddings to wild embeddings , and so no . in the present note , we try to setup a beginning of another generalization : the tame embeddings of solenoids into the 3-space .",
    "in such a study topology and dynamics interact well .",
    "the solenoids may be first defined in topology by vietoris in 1927 for 2-adic case [ v ] and by many others later for general cases , and introduced into dynamics by smale in 1967 [ s ] .",
    "solenoids can be presented either in a rather geometric way ( intersections of nested solid tori , see definition [ defn : nested intersection ] ) or in a rather algebraic way ( inverse limits of self - coverings of the circle , see definition [ defn : inverse limit ] ) , or in rather dynamics way ( mapping tori over the cantor set , see [ mc ] ) .",
    "the precise definition of tame embedding of solenoids into the 3-space @xmath3 will be given in  2 , but the intuition is quite naive .",
    "recall we identify @xmath4 with the centerline of the solid tours @xmath5 , and say an embedding @xmath6 is tame if the embedding can be extended to an embedding @xmath7 . similarly we consider a solenoid @xmath8 as the nested intersections of solid tori ( the defining sequence of @xmath8 ) , and say an embedding @xmath9 is tame if the embedding can be extended to an embedding of those solid tori into @xmath3 .",
    "solenoids themselves usually are considered as `` wild '' set .",
    "what motivated us originally to study the tame embeddings of solenoids was trying to find a non - planar set which admits a strictly achiral embedding into the 3-space .",
    "an embedding @xmath10 is called strictly achiral , if @xmath11 stays in the fixed point set of an orientation reversing homeomorphism @xmath12 .",
    "obviously any planar set has a strictly achiral embedding .",
    "indeed there is a simple relation between the two notions of achirality and planarity for compact polyhedra : if there is a strictly achiral embedding @xmath13 of a compact polyhedron @xmath2 , then @xmath2 must be planar [ jw ] . in the sequel ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether the relation from [ jw ] still holds when compact polyhedra are replaced by continua ( i.e. compact , connected metric spaces ) .",
    "the solenoids are promising , and indeed are proved to be in  4 , counterexamples to the question , because on the one hand they are continua realized as inverse limits of planar sets , on the other hand they are non - planar themselves ( see [ bin ] , and [ jwz ] for a short proof ) . in order to design a strictly achiral embedding @xmath14 for a solenoid @xmath8",
    ", we need careful and deep discussions about the tame embeddings of solenoids .    among other motivations ,",
    "when a solenoid @xmath15 is realized as a hyperbolic attractor of a dynamics ( called smale solenoid ) , the embedding @xmath15 is automatically tame .",
    "our study also gives some application on this aspect .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows .    in  2",
    ", we give the precise definitions of tame solenoids and related notions .",
    "we present a lemma about convergence of homeomorphisms which will be repeatedly used in the paper . with this lemma",
    "we give an alternative description of the tame solenoids via the language of mapping torus .",
    "for comparison we also construct examples of non - tame embeddings of solenoids vis the mapping torus description .    in  3 , we classify the tame solenoids in the 3-sphere .",
    "the classification is based on an important notion , the `` maximal '' defining sequences of tame solenoids .",
    "we also give applications including ( 1 ) the knotting , linking and invariants of tame solenoids ; ( 2 ) there are uncountably many unknotted 2-adic tame solenoids ; ( 3 ) the number of smale solenoids @xmath16 realizing the periodic solenoids of type @xmath17 is finite if all @xmath18 , and is countably infinite otherwise",
    ".    in  4 , we give criterions of when a tame solenoid in the 3-sphere is achiral or strictly achiral in term of its defining sequence , and construct strictly achiral tame solenoids to fulfil our original motivation .",
