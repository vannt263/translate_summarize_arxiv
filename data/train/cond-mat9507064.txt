    "recently it was realized that a strongly correlated 1d system , namely a chiral luttinger liquid ( @xmath3ll ) , exists in the edges of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquids @xcite . because of their chiral nature , _",
    "i.e. _ , the excitations in a given branch move only in one direction , spatially separated branches can not interfere and cause localization of states .",
    "in contrast , non - chiral luttinger liquids are extremely sensitive to the presence of even the smallest amounts of impurity in the sample , for in 1d all states are localized , and long enough wires will behave as insulators . the characteristic property of ( chiral )",
    "luttinger liquids is that the tunneling conductance between the edge states has a power law dependence on the temperature @xmath4 , where @xmath5 depends on the filling factor @xmath6 of the fqh state , taking the values @xmath7 or @xmath8 depending on the tunneling geometry .",
    "by experimentally studying the tunneling between edge states in the fqh regime using a point contact geometry , milliken , umbach , and webb @xcite found this type of power law dependence of the tunneling conductance on the temperature .",
    "their finding is consistent with the theoretical prediction @xmath9 for the @xmath10 fqh state @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the luttinger liquid behavior in tunneling between edge states has boosted theoretical interest in further studies of properties of the conductance @xcite .",
    "an exact solution for the conductance has been obtained using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , and an exact duality between the @xmath5 and @xmath11 cases has been shown @xcite in the context of the tunneling current , as suggested in ref .",
    ". the rich behavior of tunneling in chiral luttinger liquids extends well beyond transport measurements alone .",
    "one should expect , based on experience in non - interacting systems , that the noise spectrum contains information not attainable , in the most general case , from just transport measurements . in general , the shape of the noise spectrum is determined by the dynamical properties of the system , which in turn contain information about the excited states . even for non - interacting electronic systems ,",
    "non - trivial structures appear in the noise @xcite , the simplest example being the suppression of classical shot noise due to quantum statistics . in chiral luttinger liquids ,",
    "the tunneling particles sometimes carry fractional charge and fractional statistics , and thus such strongly correlated 1d systems also provide the natural experimental realization for the study of features that arise in the noise spectrum for generalized quantum statistics .    in reference",
    "@xcite , the noise spectrum of the tunneling current between edge states directly at the point contact was calculated perturbatively .",
    "to low orders in the tunneling amplitude , we found that there was a singularity at @xmath12 ; for small @xmath0 the noise spectrum has the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the zero - frequency shot noise and @xmath15 .",
    "the slope @xmath16 of the @xmath17 singularity has a strong non - linear dependence on the applied voltage @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , which is another signature of luttinger liquid behavior ( to be contrasted with the case of non - interacting electrons , @xmath20 , where the slope is independent of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 characterizes the luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "this low - frequency part of the spectrum is the one more easily accessible experimentally .",
    "secondly , there is another singularity at @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the josephson frequency of the electron ( @xmath23 ) or quasiparticle ( @xmath24 ) that tunnels through the point contact .",
    "the shape of this singularity depends on @xmath5 and goes as @xmath25 .",
    "measurements of the location of this singularity would give the value @xmath2 of the charge of the carriers of the current , which would be yet another way of observing fractional charge from noise measurements .",
    "the method originally suggested is to measure the shot noise , which for small tunneling amplitude is related to the tunneling current @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "lastly , for @xmath28 , we found that the singularities at both @xmath12 and @xmath21 should persist to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "these results present a puzzle which we describe below and address in this paper .",
    "the case of @xmath29 corresponds to a single quantum hall droplet with a constriction . in this case",
    ", quasiparticles can tunnel across the constriction , from one edge to the other ( see fig . 1a ) .",
    "these quasiparticles have fractional charge @xmath2 , given by @xmath30 . if the constriction is made narrower , the tunneling amplitude will increase . as the constriction is further narrowed ,",
    "eventually the droplet will break into two disconnected pieces , and now only electrons will be able to tunnel from one edge to the other ( see fig .",
    "their tunneling should once again behave like tunneling in a chiral luttinger liquid , but with new exponent @xmath31 and charge equal to @xmath32 .",
    "this is the physical picture behind the duality seen in reference @xcite ; as the tunneling amplitude is increased ( or the voltage is decreased ) @xmath5 goes to @xmath11 . similarly ,",
    "if we start with the two quantum hall droplets with exponent @xmath33 and increase the tunneling amplitude of the electron , eventually we will obtain the single droplet picture with exponent @xmath34 .    in light of this duality and the results of reference @xcite , the following question arises .",
    "if we start with the two disconnected droplets then we expect the singularity in the noise to occur at multiples of @xmath35 , the josephson frequency for the electron .",
    "as the tunneling amplitude is increased , at some point we expect the singularity at the josephson frequency for the quasiparticle , @xmath22 , to appear . however , according to the perturbative calculations , to all orders in the electron tunneling amplitude the quasiparticle singularity does not appear . in this paper",
    "we will address the question of what happens to this quasiparticle singularity and show how these two seemingly contradictory statements are resolved in the special case of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in short , our results suggest that the singularity at the quasiparticle josephson frequency @xmath1 is destroyed by non - perturbtive effects . in some sense , the singularity obtained by perturbative calculations is smeared for finite tunneling strength .",
    "this question is of interest because the location of the singularities tells us which particles are tunneling and , as mentioned above , should give a way to measure the fractional charge of the quasiparticles .",
    "the results in this paper suggest what may be happening at other values of @xmath5 also , and we are currently working on this question .",
    "one of the tools we use in this paper is the landauer - buttiker scattering approach .",
    "the geometry is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the choice of the landauer - buttiker approach is justified for a number of reasons .",
    "the chiral nature of the system under study naturally poses the problem in terms of incoming and outgoing scattering states to and from the point contact region .",
    "the incoming branches should be in equilibrium with their respective reservoirs of departure , and should be insensitive to the tunneling of charges in the tunneling region shown in fig .",
    "this is so because information on tunneling events can not propagate in the direction opposite to the incoming branch chirality .",
    "also , the landauer - buttiker approach and the chiral nature of the system suggest naturally a four - terminal geometry for experimental measurements , probing voltage fluctuations in the two incoming and two outgoing branchs .",
    "the tunneling takes place in the point contact , or scattering region , which is not directly accessible by the probing leads .",
    "auto - correlations of current / voltage fluctuations measured in the four terminals , as well as cross - correlations between different terminals , are the experimental probes that should allow the remote measurement of the tunneling events and noise spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the bosonization scheme for chiral luttinger liquids . in section iii",
    "we obtain the noise spectrum perturbatively for the four terminal geometry , using the keldysh non - equilibrium formalism .",
    "we show that only the noise spectrum for the outgoing branches is affected by the tunneling , whereas the incoming branches are completely insensitive to the charge transfer between the edges .",
    "this is consistent with the landauer - buttiker picture and the chirality of the system . the noise spectrum for the incoming branches can thus serve as reference level for the measurement of the excess noise on the outgoing branches due to tunneling .",
    "the noise spectrum obtained contains interesting structures both at low and high frequencies .",
    "the tunneling excess noise vanishes for frequencies above the josephson frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the issue of how the singularity moves from the quasiparticle frequency to the electron frequency is resolved in section iv , where we use the landauer - buttiker approach to solve exactly for the noise spectrum in the case of @xmath38 , for which the problem can be cast as a free fermion problem .",
    "we show that the singularity at the quasiparticle frequency is smeared for finite tunneling and is not a true singularity , whereas the singularity at the electron frequency survives for all non - zero coupling . in section",
    "v we discuss the duality when @xmath38 goes to @xmath39 , which we show is not exact in the naive sense for the case of noise , in contrast to the case of conductance .",
    "we find that the noise spectrum of the current correlations on a single branch ( auto - correlations ) satisfies the duality relation , while current correlations between distinct branches ( cross - correlations ) do not satisfy the naive duality relation .",
    "we show that the correct dual lagrangian to the @xmath38 theory is the @xmath40 theory plus a neutral density - density coupling , which has the same dimension as the tunneling operator .",
    "the effect of the neutral coupling appears in the noise , but not in the conductance .",
    "in this section we shall briefly review the bosonization scheme for edge states in the fqh effect ( for a thorough review , see ref .",
    "the lagrangian we will use is better cast in this bosonic language .",
    "the right and left moving excitations along the edges can be described by boson fields @xmath41 .",
    "right and left moving electron and quasiparticle operators on the edges of a fqh liquid can be written as @xmath42 , where @xmath5 is related to the fqh bulk state .",
    "for example , for a laughlin state with filling fraction @xmath43 we have @xmath44 for electrons and @xmath45 for quasiparticles carrying fractional charge @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath41 fields satisfy the equal - time commutation relations @xmath47=\\pm i\\pi \\ { \\rm sign}(x - y)\\ { } .\\ ] ] the dynamics of @xmath41",
    "is described by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the velocity of edge excitations ( which we will set to 1 ) .",
    "density operators can be defined in terms of the @xmath41 through @xmath50 . here , for convenience , we have set the unit charge in the definition of the density to be the electron charge @xmath32 , so that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "one can verify that @xmath53=\\sqrt{\\nu g}\\ \\psi^\\dagger_{r , l}(t , y)\\delta ( x - y)$ ] , so that indeed the cases @xmath8 and @xmath7 correspond to electron and quasiparticle charged operators , respectively .",
    "the tunneling operators from right to left moving branches and vice - versa can be written as @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus we can write , in terms of @xmath56 , the following total lagrangian density : @xmath57- \\ \\gamma \\delta(x)\\ e^{i\\sqrt{g}\\phi(t,0)}+h.c.\\ \\ , \\label{l}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 satisfying @xmath59=4\\pi i\\delta(x - y)$ ] . in the following",
    "we will set the edge velocity @xmath60 .",
    "a voltage difference between the two edges of the qh liquid can be easily introduced in the model by letting @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , with @xmath23 for electron tunneling and @xmath63 for quasiparticle tunneling .    in the following sections we will study non - equilibrium noise in chiral luttinger liquids described by the model above .",
    "in this section we treat the tunneling between edge states perturbatively , and obtain the noise spectrum for the current / voltage fluctuations at the four leads as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the figure",
    "we separate the branches into their right and left moving components , as well as incident and scattered ones .",
    "right and left branches are incoming or outgoing depending on their position relative to the scatterer : @xmath64 both the currents and the densities at the four terminals can be related to the fields @xmath41 .",
    "the densities are simply given by @xmath50 .",
    "voltage measurements probe these densities .",
    "the currents at the four terminals can be trivially related to the densities at those same terminals through the continuity equation for @xmath65 .",
    "the currents are given by @xmath66 , with positive currents flowing to the right . by choosing the convention that positive currents flow in the direction of the arrows in fig .",
    "2 , we can write new currents @xmath67 .",
    "it then becomes transparent that there is a tight relationship between current and voltage in the chiral branches .",
    "for example , measuring the noise in either the current or the voltage yields information about the other .",
    "this kind of relationship between voltage and current noise was obtained in ref . .",
    "we will thus focus on the calculation of density - density correlations , for these will give us information on both current and voltage noise .",
    "we will label the densities at the four terminals shown in fig . 2 by @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "in terms of the right and left moving fields we have : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 . the noise spectrum of the density fluctuations in terminals @xmath73 is obtained from the correlations between the densities @xmath74 : @xmath75 these quantities are calculated perturbatively in appendix a , using the techniques in ref .",
    "the components with @xmath76 are very sensitive to phases which depend on the position of the probes @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these phases cancel in the case of auto - correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath79 .",
    "the quantities @xmath80 , which correspond to the noise spectrum obtained entirely from one of the four probes for @xmath81=1 to 4 , are thus the most robust measurements of fluctuations , because when they are extracted away from the junction they are independent of the position @xmath77 where they are taken .    to second order in perturbation theory , @xmath82 is given by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 using the perturbative result to order @xmath85 for the tunneling current @xmath86 @xcite , @xmath87 can be wrtitten as @xmath88 notice that the effects of tunneling are contained in @xmath87 , and only appear in the outgoing branches , terminals @xmath89 .",
    "the incoming branches are insensitive to the tunneling between edges , due to the chiral nature of the system .",
    "information about what goes on in the junction can not propagate in the direction opposite to the chirality of the branch , and therefore the noise in the incoming branches is independent of the tunneling of charged particles between edges .",
    "this result of chirality is clear within the landauer - buttiker scattering approach .",
    "another physical consequence closely related to this is the fact that the average voltage along the branches remains constant outside the scattering region .    the second point to notice from eq .",
    "( [ noise2ndorder ] ) is that to order @xmath85 the noise in the outgoing branches that is in excess to the noise in the incoming branches has a singularity at the josephson frequency @xmath90 , vanishing for @xmath91 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the non - equilibrium voltage @xmath18 determines the frequency scale @xmath1 , up to which there is structure in the excess noise due to tunneling .",
    "such vanishing of the excess noise spectrum past a frequency set by the non - equilibrium voltage should be familiar to readers accustomed to noise in non - interacting systems ( @xmath20 ) , in which the excess noise goes to zero linearly at the josephson frequency @xcite .",
    "this point will be illustrated further in the next section , when we will have at hand the exact solution for the noise spectrum in the case of @xmath38 .",
    "the strong coupling limit of the solution for @xmath38 also gives us the solution for @xmath40 , which we shall use for comparison purposes .",
    "the last , and most important , point about this high frequency singularity in the noise spectrum is in regard to the connection between the two dual pictures illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in ref . @xcite it was pointed out that the singularity at the josephson frequency remained to all orders in perturbation theory",
    "however , the perturbative expansion for the geometries in figs .",
    "1a and 1b yields two distinct frequencies , namely the quasiparticle frequency @xmath92 when quasiparticles are the tunneling charges ( fig .",
    "1a ) , and the electron frequency @xmath93 , when electrons are the tunneling current carriers ( fig . 1b ) .",
    "these configurations are connected in the sense that one is the strong coupling limit of the other , and thus there should be a non - perturbative mechanism by which the singularity moves from one place to the other .",
    "this was the clearest open question in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which we can answer by focusing on the exactly solvable case of @xmath38 .",
    "another exactly solvable point is the trivial case @xmath20 , which unfortunately can not be used to address this issue of the singularity in the noise spectrum because in this case the two frequencies @xmath94 and @xmath95 coincide .    before answering the question about the high frequency singularity",
    ", we will close this section with the implications of tunneling between edge states to the low frequency noise measured in the four terminal geometry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a correction to the low frequency shot noise spectrum was found , which corresponded to an @xmath17 singularity , or a cusp , in the noise spectrum .",
    "this correction was found to order @xmath96 , while to order @xmath85 the low frequency corrections to the flat shot noise started as @xmath97 . in the four terminal geometry proposed in this paper ,",
    "what is probed is not the tunneling current in the junction area ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but its consequences in the current / voltage in the four terminals away from the scattering region . the four terminal measurement , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ noise2ndorder ] ) , does have a correction @xmath98 to order @xmath85 . for @xmath99",
    "we have , for example , @xmath100\\ .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one recovers the classical shot noise expression for @xmath101 .",
    "notice that , since these results are valid only to order @xmath85 , there is no correction to the classical shot noise expression for @xmath101 .",
    "corrections appear at order @xmath96 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also notice that the non - zero @xmath0 corrections to the shot noise depend on whether @xmath5 is larger or smaller then @xmath102 . for @xmath103 , the difference between the outgoing and incoming spectra ( the @xmath104 above , for example ) decreases with @xmath0 , whereas for @xmath105 it increases .",
    "in this section we will use the landauer - buttiker scattering approach to obtain an exact solution for the noise when @xmath36 . in this approach ,",
    "we use the quantum equations of motion derived from the hamiltonian to solve for the scattering states .",
    "these scattering states describe free left movers and right movers that are incident on the impurity and then are reflected or scattered by the impurity .",
    "the solutions for these states can be used to calculate the conductance and the noise in the various branches .",
    "the advantage of focussing on @xmath36 is that for this value of @xmath5 the system can be described by free fermions @xcite , making it straightforward to solve for the scattering states .",
    "however , already at @xmath36 , we expect to see singularities in the noise at @xmath22 , corresponding to quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "as the tunneling amplitude @xmath106 increases ( or @xmath18 decreases ) , we expect to obtain the dual picture at @xmath107 , with electrons tunneling and a singularity at @xmath108 .",
    "thus the full solution at @xmath36 will show us what happens to the quasiparticle singularity as @xmath106 is increased .",
    "the hope is that the qualitative behavior of these results will also apply for other values of @xmath5 .    when @xmath109 , the hamiltonian for the system is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 are the free hamiltonians for the right and left moving fields , and @xmath112 , with @xmath113 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be recast in terms of new chiral fields @xmath114 : @xmath115 the densities of the new fields @xmath116 are related to the densities @xmath117 by @xmath118 .",
    "notice that the @xmath119 fields are decoupled in eq.([hpm ] ) , and the hamiltonian for @xmath120 is simply the free @xmath121 .",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath122 can be fermionized by defining @xmath123 .",
    "one can check that @xmath124 defined as such satisfies the proper commutation relations @xmath125 .    in terms of the fermionic fields @xmath126 ,",

    "the hamiltonian above contains terms linear in the fermionic fields @xmath124 and @xmath130 , which prevent a direct calculation of the commutators that would give us the equations of motion for the fields .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by redefining the fermionic fields to be @xmath131 , with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , as in ref . @xcite .",
    "more formally , such a transformation can be constructed from the proper handling of the zero modes of the bosonic fields @xmath58 @xcite , and one can identify @xmath134 with @xmath135 , the fermion counting operator commonly used to switch from periodic to anti - periodic boundary conditions in fermionic conformal field theories .",
    "the hamiltonian we will use in the exact solution of the noise spectrum for the @xmath38 case is the one written in terms of the @xmath136 fields and @xmath134 : @xmath137 \\psi(x )     + \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\delta(x)\\left[\\gamma \\psi(x)f + \\gamma^ * f \\psi^\\dagger(x ) \\right ]   { \\big \\ } } , \\label{hpsi } % \\ ] ] where the non - vanishing equal - time commutation relations between @xmath138 and @xmath134 are @xmath139 the density @xmath140 can be written in terms of the fields @xmath141 and @xmath142 as @xmath143 , so that all correlations between @xmath140 s can be derived from the correlations of the fermions .",

    "in fact , @xmath279 also encourages tunneling because it tries to equalize the density of right movers and left movers .",
    "another way to look at it is that we can not have quasiparticles tunneling between the droplets , but density fluctuations on one side may affect the other side .    in appendix b",
    ", we found that when the interaction @xmath280 is included in the lagrangian , it gives the following contribution to the noise @xmath281                 \\bigg\\ } e^{i\\omega(x_1-x_2)}. \\label{srhorho}\\ ] ] first , we note that the density - density coupling does not affect the noise evaluated on only one side of the impurity ( i.e. when @xmath282 . ) according to equations ( [ s11seciii ] ) to ( [ s2seciii ] ) , ( [ sttscatlg ] ) , and ( [ gtgoh ] ) , this is necessary for the scattering and the perturbative calculations to agree .",
    "it is reasonable that the noise evaluated on only one side of the junction should be less affected by the counter terms and the regulator than the noise between probes on either side of the junction , because even though in both cases all the measurements are done far from the junction , in the second case the information must travel from one side of the junction to the other .",
    "second , we note that when @xmath283 , equation ( [ srhorho ] ) contains the linear term in @xmath284 , which also appears in the scattering calculation , but not in the original perturbative calculation . we find that the only density - density interaction that gives the same linear term as in the scattering result for _ all _ of the cross - correlations is the one given in equation ( [ lintdef ] ) , with @xmath285 .",
    "when we add the density - density term with this choice for @xmath284 to the original perturbative calculation , we obtain @xmath286      \\nonumber \\\\      & + & 2i|\\gamma_e|^2\\omega^2{\\rm sign}(\\omega)\\left(\\pi``\\delta(0 ) ''          - { 1\\over 3\\delta}\\right )                      \\bigg\\}e^{i\\omega(x_+ - x_-)}. \\label{pernoise}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , ( except for the divergent part ) , this perturbative result agrees with the scattering result .    to cancel the divergent part",
    ", we must regulate the delta - function properly and adjust the counterterm accordingly .",
    "then the two results will agree in the limit as @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "another approach , which may be more appropriate , is to `` smooth out '' the density - density interaction .",
    "this is accomplished by replacing the interaction in equation ( [ lintdef ] ) by the following expression @xmath289 where @xmath290 as @xmath291 .",

    "( [ pernoise ] ) , and the function @xmath134 can be chosen so that the divergence cancels . as a result , even though the duality symmetry is not exactly obeyed for the cross - correlations , it is possible to add in counter terms to bring the strong - coupling limit of one picture into agreement with the weak - coupling limit of the dual picture .    to summarize , to the order in @xmath106 we have calculated , the action for @xmath36 is dual to the renormalized action for @xmath40 , given by @xmath250               -\\gamma_e e^{-i2\\omega_0 t } \\delta(x )                             e^{\\sqrt { 2 } \\phi(t,0 ) }                        + h.c .",
